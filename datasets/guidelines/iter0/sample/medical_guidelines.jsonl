Mice have two homologous genes, but in human the first of them was lost. A low level expression of an MBL1 pseudogene 1 (MBL1P1) was detected in liver. The pseudogene encodes a truncated 51-amino acid protein that is homologous to the MBLA isoform in rodents and some primates.\n【7】 Structural mutations in exon 1 of the human MBL2 gene, at codon 52 (Arg to Cys, allele D), codon 54 (Gly to Asp, allele B) and codon 57 (Gly to Glu, allele C), also independently reduce the level of functional serum MBL by disrupting the collagenous structure of the protein. Furthermore, several nucleotide substitutions in the promoter region of the MBL2 gene at position −550 (H/L polymorphism), −221 (X/Y polymorphism) and −427, −349, −336, del (−324 to −329), −70 and +4 (P/Q polymorphisms) affect the MBL serum concentration. Both the frequency of structural mutations and the promoter polymorphisms that are in strong linkage disequilibrium vary among ethnic groups resulting in seven major haplotypes: HYPA, LYQA, LYPA, LXPA, LYPB, LYQC and HYPD. Differences in the distribution of these haplotypes are the major cause of interracial variations in MBL serum levels. Both HYPA and LYQA are high-producing haplotypes, LYPA intermediate-producing haplotype and LXPA low-producing haplotype, whereas LYPB, LYQC and HYPD are defective haplotypes, which cause a severe MBL deficiency.\n【8】 Both MBL2 and MBL1P1 genes has been repeatedly hit throughout evolution of primates. The latter silenced eventually by mutations in the glycine residues of the collagen-like region. It has been selectively turned off during evolution through the same molecular mechanisms causing the MBL2 variant alleles in man, suggesting an evolutionary selection for low-producing MBL genes.\n【9】 ## Posttranslational modifications\n【10】 In rat hepatocytes, MBL is synthesized in the rough endoplasmic reticulum. While in Golgi, it undergoes two distinct posttranslational modifications and is assembled into high molecular weight multimeric complexes. The modifications produce MBL in multiple forms of slightly various molecular masses and pI from 5.7 to 6.2. Proteolytic cleavage also resulted in removal of the 20-aa N-terminal signal peptide, and hydroxylation and glycosylation were also detected. Some cysteine residues can be converted to dehydroalanin.\n【11】 # Function\n【12】 MBL belongs to the class of collectins in the C-type lectin superfamily, whose function appears to be pattern recognition in the first line of defense in the pre-immune host. MBL recognizes carbohydrate patterns, found on the surface of a large number of pathogenic micro-organisms, including bacteria, viruses, protozoa and fungi. Binding of MBL to a micro-organism results in activation of the lectin pathway of the complement system.\n【13】 Another important function of MBL is that this molecule binds senescent and apoptotic cells and enhances engulfment of whole, intact apoptotic cells, as well as cell debris by phagocytes.\n【14】 ## Activation\n【15】 The complement system can be activated through three pathways: the classical pathway, the alternative pathway, and the lectin pathway. One way that the most-recently discovered lectin pathway is activated is through mannose-binding lectin protein. MBL binds to carbohydrates (to be specific, D-mannose and L-fucose residues) found on the surfaces of many pathogens.\n【16】 For example, MBL has been shown to bind to:\n【17】 - yeasts such as Candida albicans\n【18】 - viruses such as HIV and influenza A\n【19】 - many bacteria, including Salmonella  and Streptococci\n【20】 - parasites like Leishmania\n【21】 ## Complexes\n【22】 MBL in the blood is complexed with (bound to) another protein, a serine protease called MASP (MBL-associated serine protease). There are three MASPs: MASP-1, MASP-2 and MASP-3, which have protease domains.  There are also sMAP (also called MAp19) and MAp44, which do not have protease domains and are thought to be regulatory molecules of MASPs. MASPs also form complexes with ficolins, which are similar to MBL functionally and structurally with the exception that ficolins recognize their targets through fibrinogen-like domains, unlike MBL.\n【23】 In order to activate the complement system when MBL binds to its target (for example, mannose on the surface of a bacterium), the MASP protein functions to cleave the blood protein C4 into C4a and C4b. The C4b fragments can then bind to the surface of the bacterium, and initiate the formation of a C3-convertase.\n【24】 The subsequent complement cascade catalyzed by C3-convertase results in creating a membrane attack complex, which causes lysis of the pathogen as well as altered-self in the context of apoptotic and necrotic cells.\n【25】 MBL/MASP-1 complex also has thrombin-like activity (thrombin clots fibrin to initiate blood clots).  Mice that genetically lack MBL or MASP-1/3 (but not MASP-2/sMAP) have prolonged bleeding time in experimental injury models, although mice are seen to be normal if there is no insult to the body.\n【26】 # Clinical significance\n【27】 It is produced in the liver as a response to infection, and is part of many other factors termed acute phase proteins. Expression and function in other organs were also suggested.\n【28】 The three structural polymorphisms of exon 1 have been reported to cause susceptibility to various common infections, including meningococcal disease. However, evidence has been presented that suggests no harmful effect of these variants with regard to mengingococcal disease.", "title": "Mannan-binding lectin", "tags": "", "lang": "", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"https://www.wikidoc.org/index.php/Mannan-binding_lectin\", \"id\": \"8cfc7d2bb96d33985efb715b48d2e93063a0cd88\", \"source\": \"wikidoc\", \"overview\": \"None\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": null, "finished": false, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-01-28 23:08:00", "update_time": "2024-01-28 23:08:00"}

However the effect on quality of life remains uncertain. Future audit and research should include quality of life measures. Patients, carers and children should be informed about the unpredictability of benefit. Use of the Institute's information for the public is recommended.# The procedure\n【5】 # Indications\n【6】 Vagus nerve stimulation is indicated for use as an adjunctive therapy in reducing the frequency of seizures in patients who are refractory to anti-epileptic medication. This includes patients whose epileptic disorder is dominated by partial seizures (with or without secondary generalisation) or generalised seizures.\n【7】 # Outline of the procedure\n【8】 A battery-powered pulse-generating device is implanted under the skin of the upper left chest. A wire is tunnelled under the skin and connected to the left vagus nerve in the neck. The stimulation parameters (pulse width and frequency, current intensity, and on/off cycles) are programmed into the pulse generator via a programming wand. Patients or carers can give additional stimulation or temporarily inhibit stimulation. The battery lasts 8–10 years and can be replaced under local anaesthesia. A typical treatment regimen might comprise intermittent stimulation for 30 seconds every 5 minutes throughout the day and night.\n【9】 # Efficacy\n【10】 In one study of 50 children aged 12 years and younger, 23 (46%) experienced a greater than 50% reduction in seizure frequency. In a study of 28 children aged 12 years and younger, a mean reduction of 62% in seizure frequency was reported at 1 year. There was some evidence to suggest that quality of life improved following the procedure. Comparisons are difficult to make between the studies because of variations in the patient populations, the methods of outcome assessment and the reporting of outcomes. For more details, refer to the Sources of evidence section.\n【11】 The Specialist Advisors also noted that the procedure seemed to have some benefits in terms of mood and quality of life.\n【12】 # Safety\n【13】 The most commonly reported complications were hoarseness, sore throat and cough. In a case series of 125 children, 73 children (58%) experienced voice alteration and 48 children (38%) experienced coughing during stimulation. More serious adverse events included infection (requiring device removal) in 3% (3/100) to 6% (1/16) of patients, and breathing irregularities in 19% (3/16) of patients. For more details, refer to the Sources of evidence section.\n【14】 The Specialist Advisors believed that this is a safe procedure with no major complications.# Further information\n【15】 The Institute is in the process of developing a clinical guideline on epilepsy.

It explains the nature of the procedure and the guidance issued by NICE, and has been written with patient consent in mind.# About this guidance\n【22】 NICE interventional procedure guidance makes recommendations on the safety and efficacy of the procedure. It does not cover whether or not the NHS should fund a procedure. Funding decisions are taken by local NHS bodies after considering the clinical effectiveness of the procedure and whether it represents value for money for the NHS. It is for healthcare professionals and people using the NHS in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, and is endorsed by Healthcare Improvement Scotland for implementation by NHSScotland.\n【23】 This guidance was developed using the NICE interventional procedure guidance process.\n【24】 It has been incorporated into the NICE pathway on epilepsy, along with other related guidance and products.\n【25】 We have produced a summary of this guidance for patients and carers. Information about the evidence it is based on is also available.\n【26】 Changes since publication\n【27】 January 2012: minor maintenance.\n【28】 Your responsibility\n【29】 This guidance represents the views of NICE and was arrived at after careful consideration of the available evidence. Healthcare professionals are expected to take it fully into account when exercising their clinical judgement. This guidance does not, however, override the individual responsibility of healthcare professionals to make appropriate decisions in the circumstances of the individual patient, in consultation with the patient and/or guardian or carer.\n【30】 Implementation of this guidance is the responsibility of local commissioners and/or providers. Commissioners and providers are reminded that it is their responsibility to implement the guidance, in their local context, in light of their duties to avoid unlawful discrimination and to have regard to promoting equality of opportunity. Nothing in this guidance should be interpreted in a way which would be inconsistent with compliance with those duties.\n【31】 Copyright\n【32】 © National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence 2004.

The INTJ may also be referred to as \"the scientist.\"\n【3】 # Myers-Briggs characteristics\n【4】 According to Myers-Briggs, INTJs are very analytical individuals. Like INTPs, they are more comfortable working alone than with other people, and are not usually as sociable as others, although they are prepared to take the lead if nobody else is up to the task, or they see a major weakness in the current leadership. They tend to be very pragmatic and logical individuals, often with an individualistic bent and a low tolerance for spin or rampant emotionalism. They are also commonly not succeptible to catchphrase and commonly do not recognize authority based on tradition, rank or title.\n【5】 Hallmark features of the INTJ personality type include independence of thought, strong individualism and creativity. Persons with this personality type work best given large amounts of autonomy and creative freedom. They harbor an innate desire to express themselves; that is to be creative by conceptualizing their own intellectual designs. Analyzing and formulating complex theories are among their greatest strengths. INTJs tend to be well-suited for occupations within academia, research, management, engineering and law. Differentiating the INTJ personality type from the related INTP type is their confidence. They tend to be acutely aware of their knowledge and abilities. Thus, they develop a strong confidence in their ability and talents, making them \"natural leaders.\" It is this confidence that makes this personality type extremely rare. According to David Keirsey it is found in no more than 1% of the population.\n【6】 In forming relationships, INTJs tend to seek out others with similar character traits and ideologies. Agreement on theoretical concept is an important aspect of a relationship. By nature INTJs tend to be demanding in their expectations and approach relationships in a very rational manner. As a result, an INTJ may not always respond to a naturally occurring infatuation but wait for a mate who better fits his or her set criteria. Persons with this personality type are very stable, reliable and dedicated. Harmony in relationships and home life tends to be extremely important to the INTJ. He or she tends to withhold strong emotion and does not like to \"waste\" time with irrational social rituals. This, however, may cause non-INTJs to perceive him or her as distant and reserved.\n【7】 # Keirsey characteristics\n【8】 According to Keirsey, INTJs, or \"Mastermind Rationals\", are natural strategists, better than any other type at brainstorming approaches to situations.  They are natural, but not eager, leaders, only stepping forward when it becomes obvious to them that they are the best for the job. Strong-willed and very self-assured, they may make this decision quickly, as they tend to make all decisions.  But though they are decisive, they are always open-minded to new evidence and new ideas, flexible in their planning to accommodate changing situations.  They are excellent at judging the usefulness of ideas and will apply whatever seems most efficient to them in accomplishing their clearly envisioned goals.  To INTJs, what matters is getting it done, and they have a tendency to give little thought to personal cost in getting there.\n【9】 # Distinguished INTJs\n【10】 According to Marina Margaret Heiss at the University of Virginia, the following distinguished individuals have or had INTJ personalities:\n【11】 - Friedrich Nietzsche\n【12】 - Caesar Augustus (Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus)\n【13】 - Hannibal (Carthaginian Military Leader)\n【14】 - Stephen Hawking\n【15】 - Niels Bohr\n【16】 - Peter the Great\n【17】 - John Maynard Keynes\n【18】 - Lise Meitner\n【19】 - Ayn Rand\n【20】 - Isaac Newton\n【21】 - Osama Bin Laden\n【22】 - Rudy Giuliani, ex-New York City mayor\n【23】 - Donald Rumsfeld, ex-U.S. Secretary of Defense\n【24】 - General Colin Powell, ex-U.S. Secretary of State\n【25】 - Arnold Schwarzenegger, Governor of California\n【26】 - Michael Dukakis, ex-Governor of Massachusetts, 1988 U.S. Democratic presidential candidate\n【27】 - Susan B. Anthony, civil rights pioneer\n【28】 Presidents:\n【29】 - Thomas Jefferson\n【30】 - James K. Polk\n【31】 - Ulysses S. Grant\n【32】 - Chester A. Arthur\n【33】 - Woodrow Wilson\n【34】 - Calvin Coolidge\n【35】 - Dwight D. Eisenhower\n【36】 - John F.

This represents the person's \"default\" pattern of behavior in their day to day life. The Dominant is the personality type's preferred role, the task they feel most comfortable with.  The auxiliary function is the role they feel the next most comfortable with.  It serves to support and expand on the dominant function.  One of these first two will always be an information gathering function (sensing or intuition) and the other will be a decision making function(thinking or feeling) in some order. The tertiary function is less developed than the Dominant and Auxiliary functions, but develops as the person matures and provides roundness of ability.  The inferior function is the personality type's Achilles' heel. This is the function they are least comfortable with. Like the tertiary function, this function strengthens with maturity.\n【50】 - Dominant Introverted Intuition\n【51】 - Auxiliary Extroverted Thinking\n【52】 - Tertiary Introverted Feeling\n【53】 - inferior Extroverted Sensing", "title": "INTJ", "tags": "", "lang": "", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"id\": \"5385908c8df53314a31b6927213dbad7cb7441b4\", \"url\": \"https://www.wikidoc.org/index.php/INTJ\", \"source\": \"wikidoc\", \"overview\": \"None\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-01-28 23:08:00", "update_time": "2024-02-18 22:25:05"}

In reproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, oral administration of zolmitriptan to pregnant animals resulted in embryolethality and fetal abnormalities (malformations and variations) at clinically relevant exposures.\n【4】 When zolmitriptan was administered to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at oral doses of 100, 400, and 1200 mg/kg/day (plasma exposures (AUCs) ≈280, 1100, and 5000 times the human AUC at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 10 mg/day), there was a dose-related increase in embryolethality. A no-effect dose for embryolethality was not established. When zolmitriptan was administered to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis at oral doses of 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg/day (plasma AUCs ≈1, 11, and 42 times the human AUC at the MRHD), there were increases in embryolethality and in fetal malformations and variations. The no-effect dose for adverse effects on embryo-fetal development was associated with a plasma AUC similar to that in humans at the MRHD.

The no-effect dose was associated with a plasma AUC ≈280 times that in humans at the MRHD.\n【5】 ### 8.3 Nursing Mothers\n【6】 It is not known whether zolmitriptan is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from zolmitriptan, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. In rats, oral dosing with zolmitriptan resulted in levels in milk up to 4 times higher than in plasma.\n【7】 ### 8.4 Pediatric Use\n【8】 The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Therefore, zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets are not recommended for use in patients under 18 years of age.\n【9】 One randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of zolmitriptan tablets (2.5, 5 and 10 mg) evaluated 696 pediatric patients (aged 12 to 17 years) with migraines. This study did not demonstrate the efficacy of zolmitriptan compared to placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents. Adverse reactions in the adolescent patients treated with zolmitriptan were similar in nature and frequency to those reported in clinical trials in adults treated with zolmitriptan. Zolmitriptan has not been studied in pediatric patients less than 12 years old.\n【10】 In the postmarketing experience with triptans, including zolmitriptan, there were no additional adverse reactions seen in pediatric patients that were not seen in adults.\n【11】 ### 8.5 Geriatric Use\n【12】 Clinical studies of zolmitriptan did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.\n【13】 A cardiovascular evaluation is recommended for geriatric patients who have other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of coronary artery disease) prior to receiving zolmitriptan .\n【14】 The pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan were similar in geriatric patients (aged > 65 years) compared to younger patients .\n【15】 ### 8.6 Patients with Hepatic Impairment\n【16】 After oral zolmitriptan administration, zolmitriptan blood levels were increased in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment, and significant elevation in blood pressure was observed in some of these patients .

The table below outlines the possible scenarios that would be classified as abrupt closure:\n【5】 # Classification\n【6】 Abrupt closure can be classified as sustained or transient:\n【7】 - Sustained abrupt closure: Abrupt closure that has been present when the patient left the cardiac catheterization laboratory.\n【8】 - Transient abrupt closure: Abrupt closure that has been treated with restoration of coronary blood flow to TIMI flow grade 2 or 3 before the patient left the cardiac catheterization laboratory.\n【9】 # Causes\n【10】 Abrupt closure occurs primarily as a result of acute coronary dissection, thrombosis, intracoronary spasm, embolization, intra-procedural stent thrombosis or, most often, a combination of all the above during coronary intervention.\n【11】 # Epidemiology and Demographics\n【12】 It occurs during 3-5% of balloon angioplasty procedures.

In 1907, Marie Pielkiewics coined the French term 'La Bruxomanie\" for bruxism. Bruxism can be classified into awake bruxism and sleep bruxism based on the physiological sleep status of the individual. The etiology of bruxism can be categorized into three groups:psychosocial factors, peripheral factors, and pathophysiological factors. Multifactorial etiology causes involving brain neurotransmitters or basal ganglia. Bruxism affects men and women equally. Factors associated with an increased risk of bruxism include obstructive sleep apnea, alcohol abuse, caffeine intake, smoking, and anxiety. The symptoms of bruxism usually develop in the first decade of life, and start with the appearance of the first primary upper and lower anterior teeth. Common complications of bruxism are tooth wear, and tooth hypersensitivity. Bruxism is primarily diagnosed based on the clinical presentation. History of complaints of disturbance from the clicking or grating sound by the accompanied partners. The most common symptoms of bruxism include involuntary rhythmic contractions of the masticator muscles during sleep. Removal of any offending agent responsible for bruxism is the primary step in the management. Surgery is the mainstay of treatment in the management of bruxism.\n【3】 # Historical Perspective\n【4】 - In 1907, Marie Pielkiewics coined the French term 'La Bruxomanie\"  for bruxism. \n【5】 - In 1931, Frohman first coined the English term bruxism.\n【6】 # Classification\n【7】 Bruxism can be classified into awake bruxism and sleep bruxism based on the physiological sleep status of the individual.\n【8】 # Causes\n【9】 The etiology of bruxism can be categorized into three groups: psychosocial factors, peripheral factors, and pathophysiological factors.\n【10】 # Pathophysiology\n【11】 - Bruxism is caused by the activation of reflexive chewing activity\n【12】 - Chewing is a neuromuscular activity that is controlled by the reflex nerve pathways.\n【13】 - During sleep, the reflex part is active while the higher control is inactive, resulting in bruxism.\n【14】 - As stated, bruxism is considered to have multifactorial etiology. Multifactorial etiology causes involving brain neurotransmitters or basal ganglia.\n【15】 - Pathophysiological Factors\n【16】 As bruxism often occurs during sleep, the physiology of sleep has been studied extensively, especially the ‘arousal response’, in search of possible causes of a disorder.\n【17】 Arousal response is a sudden change in the depth of the sleep during which the individual either arrives in the lighter sleep stage or actually wakes up.\n【18】 Such a response is accompanied by gross body movements, increased heart rate, respiratory changes, and increased muscle activity.\n【19】 It is derived that disturbances in the central neurotransmitter system may be involved in the etiology of bruxism.\n【20】 It is hypothesized that the direct and indirect pathways of the basal ganglion, a group of five subcortical nuclei that are involved in the coordination of movements, is disturbed in bruxer.\n【21】 The direct output pathway goes directly from the stratum to the thalamus from where afferent signals project to the cerebral cortex. The indirect pathway, on the other hand, passes by several other nuclei before reaching it to the thalamus.\n【22】 If there is an imbalance between the pathways, movement disorder results like Parkinson’s disease.\n【23】 The imbalance occurs with the disturbances in the dopamine-mediated transmission of an action potential. In the case of bruxism there may be an imbalance in both pathways.\n【24】 Acute use of dopamine precursors like L-dopa inhibits bruxism activity and chronic long-term use of l-dopa results in increased bruxism activity. SSRTs (serotonin reuptake inhibitors), which exert an indirect influence on the dopaminergic system, may cause bruxism after long-term use.\n【25】 Amphetamine, which increases the dopamine concentration by facilitating its release has been observed to increase bruxism.\n【26】 Nicotine stimulates central dopaminergic activities, which might explain the finding that cigarette smokers report bruxism two times more than the nonsmokers.\n【27】 - As bruxism often occurs during sleep, the physiology of sleep has been studied extensively, especially the ‘arousal response’, in search of possible causes of a disorder.\n【28】 - Arousal response is a sudden change in the depth of the sleep during which the individual either arrives in the lighter sleep stage or actually wakes up.\n【29】 - Such a response is accompanied by gross body movements, increased heart rate, respiratory changes, and increased muscle activity.\n【30】 - It is derived that disturbances in the central neurotransmitter system may be involved in the etiology of bruxism.\n【31】 - It is hypothesized that the direct and indirect pathways of the basal ganglion, a group of five subcortical nuclei that are involved in the coordination of movements, is disturbed in bruxer.\n【32】 - The direct output pathway goes directly from the stratum to the thalamus from where afferent signals project to the cerebral cortex.

Plasma adefovir concentrations declined in a biexponential manner with a terminal elimination half-life of 7.48 ± 1.65 hours.\n【8】 The pharmacokinetics of adefovir in subjects with adequate renal function were not affected by once daily dosing of 10 mg HEPSERA over seven days. The impact of long-term once daily administration of 10 mg HEPSERA on adefovir pharmacokinetics has not been evaluated.\n【9】 ### Effects of Food on Oral Absorption\n【10】 Adefovir exposure was unaffected when a 10 mg single dose of HEPSERA was administered with food (an approximately 1000 kcal high-fat meal). HEPSERA may be taken without regard to food.\n【11】 ### Distribution\n【12】 In vitro binding of adefovir to human plasma or human serum proteins is less than or equal to 4% over the adefovir concentration range of 0.1 to 25 µg/mL. The volume of distribution at steady-state following intravenous administration of 1.0 or 3.0 mg/kg/day is 392 ± 75 and 352 ± 9 mL/kg, respectively.\n【13】 ### Metabolism and Elimination\n【14】 Following oral administration, adefovir dipivoxil is rapidly converted to adefovir. Forty-five percent of the dose is recovered as adefovir in the urine over 24 hours at steady state following 10 mg oral doses of HEPSERA. Adefovir is renally excreted by a combination of glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion .\n【15】 ### Assessment of Drug Interactions\n【16】 Adefovir dipivoxil is rapidly converted to adefovir in vivo. At concentrations substantially higher (greater than 4000-fold) than those observed in vivo, adefovir did not inhibit any of the common human CYP450 enzymes, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. Adefovir is not a substrate for these enzymes. However, the potential for adefovir to induce CYP450 enzymes is unknown. Based on the results of these in vitro experiments and the renal elimination pathway of adefovir, the potential for CYP450 mediated interactions involving adefovir as an inhibitor or substrate with other medicinal products is low.\n【17】 The pharmacokinetics of adefovir have been evaluated in healthy adult volunteers following multiple dose administration of HEPSERA (10 mg once daily) in combination with lamivudine (100 mg once daily) (N=18), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (160/800 mg twice daily) (N=18), acetaminophen (1000 mg four times daily) (N=20), ibuprofen (800 mg three times daily) (N=18), and enteric coated didanosine (400 mg) (N=21). The pharmacokinetics of adefovir have also been evaluated in post-liver transplantation patients following multiple dose administration of HEPSERA (10 mg once daily) in combination with tacrolimus (N=16). The pharmacokinetics of adefovir have been evaluated in healthy volunteers following single dose pegylated interferon α-2a (PEG-IFN) (180 µg) (N=15).\n【18】 Adefovir did not alter the pharmacokinetics of lamivudine, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, enteric coated didanosine (didanosine EC), or tacrolimus. The evaluation of the effect of adefovir on the pharmacokinetics of pegylated interferon α-2a was inconclusive due to the high variability of pegylated interferon alpha-2a.\n【19】 The pharmacokinetics of adefovir were unchanged when HEPSERA was coadministered with lamivudine, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, acetaminophen, didanosine EC, tacrolimus (based on cross study comparison), and pegylated interferon α-2a. When HEPSERA was coadministered with ibuprofen (800 mg three times daily) increases in adefovir Cmax (33%), AUC (23%) and urinary recovery were observed. This increase appears to be due to higher oral bioavailability, not a reduction in renal clearance of adefovir.\n【20】 Apart from lamivudine, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and acetaminophen, the effects of coadministration of HEPSERA with drugs that are excreted renally, or other drugs known to affect renal function have not been evaluated.\n【21】 The effect of adefovir on cyclosporine concentrations is not known.\n【22】 No drug interaction studies have been performed in adolescent patients 12 to less than 18 years of age.\n【23】 ### Special Populations\n【24】 Gender\n【25】 The pharmacokinetics of adefovir were similar in male and female patients.\n【26】 Race\n【27】 The pharmacokinetics of adefovir have been shown to be comparable in Caucasians and Asians. Pharmacokinetic data are not available for other racial groups.\n【28】 Geriatric Patients\n【29】 Pharmacokinetic studies have not been conducted in the elderly.\n【30】 Pediatric Patients\n【31】 The pharmacokinetics of adefovir were assessed from drug plasma concentrations in 53 HBeAg positive hepatitis B pediatric patients with compensated liver disease. The exposure of adefovir following a 48 week daily treatment with adefovir dipivoxil 10 mg tablet in pediatric patients 12 to less than 18 years of age (Cmax = 23.3 ng/mL and AUC0–24 = 248.8 ng∙h/mL) was comparable to that observed in adult patients.\n【32】 Renal Impairment\n【33】 In adults with moderately or severely impaired renal function or with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring hemodialysis, Cmax, AUC, and half-life (T1/2) were increased compared to adults with normal renal function. It is recommended that the dosing interval of HEPSERA be modified in these patients .\n【34】 The pharmacokinetics of adefovir in non-chronic hepatitis B patients with varying degrees of renal impairment are described in Table 3. In this study, subjects received a 10 mg single dose of HEPSERA.\n【35】 A four-hour period of hemodialysis removed approximately 35% of the adefovir dose. The effect of peritoneal dialysis on adefovir removal has not been evaluated.\n【36】 The pharmacokinetics of adefovir have not been studied in adolescent patients with renal dysfunction .\n【37】 Hepatic Impairment\n【38】 The pharmacokinetics of adefovir following a 10 mg single dose of HEPSERA have been studied in non-chronic hepatitis B patients with hepatic impairment. There were no substantial alterations in adefovir pharmacokinetics in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment compared to unimpaired patients. No change in HEPSERA dosing is required in patients with hepatic impairment.", "title": "Adefovir clinical pharmacology", "tags": "", "lang": "", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"overview\": \"None\", \"id\": \"ba52dd453a96e7c67fd54910b1a9edade21407b2\", \"url\": \"https://www.wikidoc.org/index.php/Adefovir_clinical_pharmacology\", \"source\": \"wikidoc\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-01-28 23:08:00", "update_time": "2024-02-18 23:13:31"}

Dosage and route of administration should be determined by susceptibility of the causative organisms, severity and site of infection, and the condition of the patient.\n【4】 Because of the serious nature of infections due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, dosage of 2 g every six or eight hours is recommended, at least upon initiation of therapy, in systemic infections caused by this organism.\n【5】 The intravenous route is recommended for patients requiring single doses greater than 1 g or those with bacterial septicemia, localized parenchymal abscess (eg, intra-abdominal abscess), peritonitis, or other severe systemic or life-threatening infections.\n【6】 The duration of therapy depends on the severity of infection. Generally, AZACTAM should be continued for at least 48 hours after the patient becomes asymptomatic or evidence of bacterial eradication has been obtained. Persistent infections may require treatment for several weeks. Doses smaller than those indicated should not be used.\n【7】 ## Renal Impairment in Adult Patients\n【8】 Prolonged serum levels of aztreonam may occur in patients with transient or persistent renal insufficiency. Therefore, the dosage of AZACTAM should be halved in patients with estimated creatinine clearances between 10 and 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 after an initial loading dose of 1 or 2 g.\n【9】 When only the serum creatinine concentration is available, the following formula (based on sex, weight, and age of the patient) may be used to approximate the creatinine clearance (Clcr). The serum creatinine should represent a steady state of renal function.\n【10】 In patients with severe renal failure (creatinine clearance less than 10 mL/min/1.73 m2), such as those supported by hemodialysis, the usual dose of 500 mg, 1 g, or 2 g should be given initially. The maintenance dose should be one-fourth of the usual initial dose given at the usual fixed interval of 6, 8, or 12 hours. For serious or life-threatening infections, in addition to the maintenance doses, one-eighth of the initial dose should be given after each hemodialysis session.\n【11】 ## Dosage in the Elderly\n【12】 Renal status is a major determinant of dosage in the elderly; these patients in particular may have diminished renal function. Serum creatinine may not be an accurate determinant of renal status. Therefore, as with all antibiotics eliminated by the kidneys, estimates of creatinine clearance should be obtained and appropriate dosage modifications made if necessary.\n【13】 ## Dosage in Pediatric Patients\n【14】 AZACTAM should be administered intravenously to pediatric patients with normal renal function.

In 2006, its manufacturer AstraZeneca announced that it would not attempt to market ximelagatran after reports of hepatotoxicity (liver damage) during trials, and to discontinue its distribution in countries where the drug had been approved.\n【3】 # Method of action\n【4】 Ximelagatran was the first member of the drug class of direct thrombin inhibitors that can be taken orally. It acts solely by inhibiting the actions of thrombin. It is taken orally twice daily, and rapidly absorbed by the small intestine. Ximelagatran is a prodrug, being converted in vivo to the active agent melagatran. This conversion takes place in the liver and many other tissues through dealkylation and dehydroxylation (replacing the ethyl and hydroxyl groups with hydrogen).\n【5】 # Uses\n【6】 Ximelagatran was expected to replace warfarin and sometimes aspirin and heparin in many therapeutic settings, including deep venous thrombosis, prevention of secondary venous thromboembolism and complications of atrial fibrillation such as stroke. The efficacy of ximelagatran for these indications had been well-documented (Eriksson et al 2003, Frances et al 2004, Schulman et al 2004).\n【7】 An advantage, according to early reports by its manufacturer, was that it could be taken orally without any monitoring of its anticoagulant properties. This would have set it apart from warfarin and heparin, which require monitoring of the international normalized ratio (INR) and the partial thromboplastin time (PTT), respectively. A disadvantage recognised early was the absence of an antidote in case acute bleeding develops, while warfarin can be antagonised by vitamin K and heparin by protamine sulfate.\n【8】 # Side-effects\n【9】 Ximelagatran was generally well tolerated in the trial populations, but a small proportion (5-6%) developed elevated liver enzyme levels, which prompted the FDA to reject an initial application for approval in 2004. The further development was discontinued in 2006 after it turned out hepatic damage could develop in the period subsequent to withdrawal of the drug.

It is used to treat and prevent ulcers and to treat other conditions in which the stomach makes too much acid. The drug will be injected into a large muscle (such as your buttock or hip); added to an intravenous fluid that will drip through a needle or catheter placed in your vein for at least 15 minutes, three or four times a day; or administered by constant infusion over 24 hours. This medication is sometimes prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n【3】 Your health care provider (doctor, nurse, or pharmacist) may measure the effectiveness and side effects of your treatment using laboratory tests and physical examinations. It is important to keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. The length of treatment depends on how you respond to the medication.\n【4】 # Precautions\n【5】 Before administering cimetidine:\n【6】 - tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to cimetidine or any other drugs.\n【7】 - tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications you are taking, especially amitriptyline (Elavil), anticoagulants ('blood thinners') such as warfarin (Coumadin), chlordiazepoxide (Librium), desipramine (Norpramin), diazepam (Valium), diuretics ('water pills'), imipramine (Tofranil), metronidazole (Flagyl), nifedipine (Adalat, Procardia), phenytoin (Dilantin), propranolol (Inderal), theophylline (Theo-Dur), triamterene (Dyrenium), and vitamins.\n【8】 - tell your doctor if you have or have ever had kidney or liver disease.\n【9】 - tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking cimetidine, call your doctor.\n【10】 - remember to administer it slowly. If cimetidine is administered too rapidly, you may develop severe dizziness and faintness. Do not administer your cimetidine faster than directed. If you feel faint or dizzy, call your health care provider immediately.\n【11】 # Administering your medication\n【12】 Before you administer cimetidine, look at the solution closely. It should be clear and free of floating material. Gently squeeze the bag or observe the solution container to make sure there are no leaks. Do not use the solution if it is discolored, if it contains particles, or if the bag or container leaks. Use a new solution, but show the damaged one to your health care provider.\n【13】 It is important that you use your medication exactly as directed. Do not stop your therapy on your own for any reason. Do not change your dosing schedule without talking to your health care provider. Your health care provider may tell you to stop your infusion if you have a mechanical problem (such as a blockage in the tubing, needle, or catheter); if you have to stop an infusion, call your health care provider immediately so your therapy can continue.\n【14】 # Side effects\n【15】 ## Minor side effects\n【16】 Cimetidine may cause side effects.

If you are receiving cimetidine intravenously (in your vein), you probably will be told to store it in the refrigerator or freezer. \n【34】 Take your next dose from the refrigerator 1 hour before using it; place it in a clean, dry area to allow it to warm to room temperature. \n【35】 If you are told to store additional cimetidine in the freezer, always move a 24-hour supply to the refrigerator for the next day's use. \n【36】 Do not refreeze medications.\n【37】 If you are receiving cimetidine intramuscularly (in your muscle), your health care provider will tell you how to store it properly.\n【38】 Store your medication only as directed. Make sure you understand what you need to store your medication properly.\n【39】 Keep your supplies in a clean, dry place when you are not using them, and keep all medications and supplies out of reach of children. Your health care provider will tell you how to throw away used needles, syringes, tubing, and containers to avoid accidental injury.\n【40】 # In case of emergency/overdose\n【41】 In case of overdose, call your local poison control center at 1-800-222-1222.

The ST segments elevate because the full thickness of heart muscle is injured (transmural injury).  This full thickness injury and ST elevation is the result of a total occlusion of a coronary artery.  Some STEMIs, particularly those involving the posterior or back surface of the heart, may be missed by the present traditional system of placing a limited number of leads on the front of the chest.\n【3】 In contrast to the 12 leads of data and the limited anterior or front view of the heart from a traditional EKG, an 80 lead EKG (such as the PRIME ECG®) utilizes 80 leads placed on both the front and back of the patient to analyze a 360-degree spatial view of the heart.  This new technology may allow the more rapid and accurate detection of STEMI and thereby potentially speed the delivery of care.\n【4】 # Display of 80 Lead EKG Data\n【5】 Analysis is performed on a computer selected representative beat. ST-segment elevation and depression are translated into colors (red = elevation, blue = depression) and displayed against a 3 dimensional torso image for physician review. These images allow for rapid pattern recognition that identifies problem areas that correlate with regions of ischemia or infarction. This use of graphic imaging allows the physician to quickly focus on specific ECG morphology that contains the most valuable diagnostic information without having to expend time exploring data from all 80 leads.\n【6】 System software facilitates examination of the actual ECG trace for each of the 80 recordings. The user places a cursor over the suspect area and a pop-up window reveals the underlying electrode tracing and provides the value of elevation or depression at that lead.\n【7】 # Sensitivity and Specificity of 80 Lead EKGs\n【8】 Ten years of clinical data and in-hospital experience have demonstrated an increase in sensitivity over the 12 lead EKG in the range of 18% with no loss in specificity.  As a result, there is the potential to detect  up to 40% more ST Elevation MIs (serious heart attacks) than the traditional 12-lead EKG.\n【9】 # Delays in Diagnosing ST Elevation MI with Traditional 12 Lead Systems\n【10】 Registry data from the National Registry of Myocardial Infarction (NRMI), CRUSADE and GRACE have demonstrated that there are significant opportunities for improvement in door-to-balloon time and door-to-needle time in the management of serious heart attacks (STEMI). The 80 lead ECG may provide a technological advance that would speed the correct diagnosis of ST elevation MI.  A substantial number of patients have a non-diagnostic 12-lead and these patients may wait for extended periods in the emergency room pending the results of tests that measure enzymes released into the bloodstream (biomarkers) to diagnose a heart attack.\n【11】 # The Potential to Miss the Diagnosis of STEMI Using the Traditional 12 Lead EKG\n【12】 Heart attacks involving the back side of the heart may cause ST depression rather than ST elevation (STEMI) becuase the pattern of electrical injury is reversed on the traditional 12 lead EKG.  One of These patients may currently be receiving less aggressive care because of a diagnosis of non-ST-elevation MI (NSTEMI) based on ST-depression, which may in fact be ST-elevation in a portion of the heart not visible with the 12 lead.  Assuming approximately 20-30% of diagnosed MI patients are now diagnosed as STEMI patients and 70-80% are diagnosed as NSTEMI, the PRIME data would indicate that approximately 1 in every 3 patients may in fact be at a higher risk which would make them suitable for more aggressive care.\n【13】 # Example of a STEMI Missed on 12 Lead EKG Detected on 80 Lead EKG\n【14】 Be sure to click on the images below to enlarge them\n【15】 Shown below is the 12 lead EKG in a patient that presented with substernal chest pain.

They form a family of collagenous Ca2+-dependent defense lectins, which are found in animals. Collectins are soluble pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Their function is to bind to oligosaccharide structure or lipids which are on the surface of microorganisms. Like other PRRs they bind pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and also danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) of oligosaccharide origin. Binding of collectins to microorganisms may trigger elimination of microorganisms by aggregation, complement activation, opsonization, activation of phagocytosis or  inhibition of microbial growth. Other functions of collectins are modulation of inflammatory, allergic responses, adaptive immune system and clearance of apoptotic cells.\n【3】 # Structure\n【4】 Functionally collectins are trimers. Monomeric subunit consists of four parts:\n【5】 - A cysteine-rich domain at the N-terminus\n【6】 - A collagen-like domain\n【7】 - A coiled-coil neck domain\n【8】 - A C-type lectin domain that is also called a carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD)\n【9】 Recognition of specific parts of microorganism is mediated by CRD in presence of calcium. Affinity of interaction between microbes and collectins depends on the degree of collectin oligomerization and also on the density of ligands on the surface of the microbe.\n【10】 # Types of Collectins\n【11】 9 types of collectins have been defined to date:\n【12】 - MBL = mannan-binding lectin (mannose-binding lectin)\n【13】 - SP-A = surfactant protein A\n【14】 - SP-D = surfactant protein D\n【15】 - CL-L1 = collectin liver 1\n【16】 - CL-P1 = collectin placenta 1\n【17】 - CL-43 = conglutinin collectin of 43 kDa\n【18】 - CL-46 = collectin of 46 kDa\n【19】 - CL-K1 = collectin kidney 1\n【20】 - Conglutinin\n【21】 CL-43, CL-46 and conglutinin are found in bovine.\n【22】 # Function\n【23】 ## Aggregation\n【24】 Collectins can bind on the surface of the microorganism and between carbohydrate ligands can be made a bond. Due to those properties the interaction can result into aggregation.\n【25】 ## Opsonization and Activation of Phagocytosis\n【26】 Collectins can act as opsonins. There is a specific interaction between collectins and receptors on phagocytic cells which can lead to increased clearance of microorganisms. MBL can bind to microorganisms and this interaction can lead to opsonization through complement activation, or it can opsonize the microorganism directly. SP-A and SP-D can also interact with microorganisms and phagocytic cells to enhance phagocytosis of the microorganism.\n【27】 ## Inhibition of Microbial Growth\n【28】 Collectins have effect on microorganism survival. SP-A and SP-D can bind to LPS (lipopolysaccharide) of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. SP-A and SP-D can increase permeability of Gram-negative bacterial cell membrane.\n【29】 ## Modulation of Inflammatory Responses\n【30】 SP-A and SP-D can damp induction of inflammation by LPS or endotoxin. It can be caused by removing the LPS or by binding the LPS to CD14 receptor on macrophages which can block the inflammatory response. SP-A can also bind to TLR2 (Toll-like receptor 2). This interaction causes decrease of TNF-α (Tumor necrosis factor-α) production by alveolar macrophages stimulated with peptidoglycan. SP-A and SP-D can modulate cytokine production. They modulate the production of oxygen and nitrogen reactive species which are very important for phagocytic cells. SP-A and SP-D has s function as chemoattractants for alveolar neutrophils and monocytes. MBL can recognize peptidoglykan via N-acetylglukosamine. This interaction leads to inhibition of ligand-induced inflammatory by macrophage chemokine production.\n【31】 ## Modulation of the Adaptive Immune System\n【32】 SP-A and SP-D can suppress activated T-lymphocytes and IL-2 (interleukin-2) production. SP-D increases bacterial antigen presentation by dendritic cells   whereas SP-A blocs differentation of the immature dendritic cells.\n【33】 ## Modulation of Allergic Response\n【34】 Collectins SP-A and SP-D have anti-allergic effect. They inhibit IgE binding to allergen, decrease histamin release from basophils and inhibit T-lymfocyte production in the late phase of the inflammation.\n【35】 ## Apoptosis\n【36】 Collectins SP-A and SP-D enhance clearance of apoptotic cells by macrophages.\n【37】 ## Complement Activation\n【38】 Collectins are linked with activation of lectin pathway of complement activation. At the beginning, there is a binding of collectin to PAMPs or DAMPs. Collectin MBL is involved in activation of the lectin complement pathway. There are three serine proteases, MASP-1, 2 and 3 (MBL-associated serine proteases), which participate in activation of the lectin pathway. MASP-2 has a cleavage activity and it is essential for forming lectin C3 and C5 convertases and for activation of the complement.\n【39】 # Reviews\n【40】 For more informations and details see reviews.", "title": "Collectin", "tags": "", "lang": "", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"id\": \"8f104e8a615c20a3783616a35c82bf70c7bc0700\", \"source\": \"wikidoc\", \"url\": \"https://www.wikidoc.org/index.php/Collectin\", \"overview\": \"None\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-01-28 23:08:00", "update_time": "2024-01-28 23:54:46"}
{"id": 415537, "user_id": "6576f4e0014d3d1c31d6fe43", "user_name": "曾垂松", "task_id": 143, "source_info": {"seq_id": 22059, "text": "【0】 Gliotransmitter\n【1】 Gliotransmitters are chemicals released from glial cells that facilitate neuronal communication between neurons and other glial cells and are usually induced from Ca2+ signaling.   While gliotransmitters can be released from any glial cell, including oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and microglia, they are primarily released from astrocytes. Astrocytes rely on gap junctions for coupling, and are star-like in shape, which allows them to come into contact with many other synapses in various regions of the brain.  Their structure also makes them capable of bidirectional signaling.  It is estimated that astrocytes can make contact with over 100,000 synapses, allowing them to play an essential role in synaptic transmission.    While gliotransmission primarily occurs between astrocytes and neurons, gliotransmission is not limited to these two cell types.   Besides the central nervous system, gliotransmission also occurs among motor nerve terminals and Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system.  Another occurrence of gliotransmission takes place between glial cells in the retina, called Müller cells, and retinal neurons. \n【2】 # Function\n【3】 The word “glia” illustrates the original belief among scientists that these cells play a passive role in neural signaling, being responsible only for neuronal structure and support within the brain.   Glial cells cannot produce action potentials and therefore were not suspected as playing an important and active communicative role in the central nervous system, because synaptic transmission between neurons is initiated with an action potential.  However, research shows that these cells express excitability with changes in the intracellular concentrations of Ca2+.  Gliotransmission occurs because of the ability of glial cells to induce excitability with variations in Ca2+ concentrations.  Changes in the concentration of Ca2+ correlate with currents from NMDA receptor-mediated neurons which are measured in neighboring neurons of the ventrobasal (VB) thalamus.   Because glial cells greatly outnumber neurons in the brain, accounting for over 70% of all cells in the central nervous system, gliotransmitters released by astrocytes have the potential to be very influential and important within the central nervous system, as well as within other neural systems throughout the body.   These cells do not simply carry functions of structural support, but can also take part in cell-to-cell communication with neurons, microglia, and other astrocytes by receiving inputs, organizing information, and sending out chemical signals.   The Ca2+ signal from the astrocyte may also participate in controlling blood flow in the brain. \n【4】 Gliotransmitters have been shown to control synapse development and regulate synaptic function, and their release can lead to paracrine actions on astrocytes as well as the regulation of neurotransmission.  The definition of a gliotransmitters is not only defined by its presence in glial cells, but is determined by other factors, including its metabolic pathway.   Also, the function of gliotransmitters varies according to their type, and each gliotransmitter has a specific target receptor and action.\n【5】 Glial cells are important in hormonal and neuroendocrine function in the central nervous system and have an active role in sleep, cognition, synaptic function and plasticity, and promote remyelination and regeneration of injured nervous tissue.  Other functions include the regulation of neurosecretory neurons and the release of hormones.\n【6】 # Types of gliotransmitters\n【7】 The major types of gliotransmitters released from astrocytes include glutamate, ATP, and D-serine.  Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter within the central nervous system that can also be defined as a gliotransmitter due to its ability to increase cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations in astrocytes.   Its main target receptors include Kainate receptors, metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), and especially N-methyl D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs).   NMDARs are glutamatergic receptors that play an important role in synaptic plasticity.   Other functions of this gliotransmitter include synchronous depolarization, increasing the frequency of postsynaptic currents, and also increasing the likelihood of release and frequency of AMPA-receptor-dependent postsynaptic currents  NMDARs are controlled by a voltage-gated channel receptor that is blocked by magnesium.   Calcium can enter through NMDAR channels due to the cell’s depolarization, which removes the magnesium block, and therefore activating these receptors. \n【8】 ATP is a gliotransmitters that is released from astrocytes and restrains neuronal activity.  ATP targets P2X receptors, P2Y, and A1 receptors.   ATP has several functions as a gliotransmitter, including injection of AMPA receptors into the postsynaptic terminal, paracrine activity through calcium waves in astrocytes, and suppression of synaptic transmission.  Neuronal activity is controlled in the retina by the molecule’s ability to hyperpolarize the neuron by converting from ATP to adenosine.   ATP plays a role in facilitating neuroinflammation and remyelination by entering into the cell’s extracellular space upon injury to activate purinergic receptors, which increase the production of gliotransmitters.   The mechanism of ATP release from astrocytes is not well understood.  Although it is unclear whether or not ATP-mediated gliotransmission is calcium-dependent, it is believed that ATP release is partly dependent on Ca2+ and SNARE proteins and involves multiple pathways, with exocytosis being the suggested method of release. \n【9】 Other less common gliotransmitters include:\n【10】 - homocysteic acid, an endogenous N-methyl-(D)-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR) agonist\n【11】 - taurine\n【12】 - atrial natriuretic factor (ANF)\n【13】 - tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha).\n【14】 # Cell-to-cell communication\n【15】 While neurotransmission is defined as information exchange between neurons, gliotransmission does not simply occur between astrocytes, but also between astrocytes, neurons and microglia.   Between astrocytes, a “Ca wave” of activity can be initiated, even when they are not in contact with each other, stimulating release of gliotransmitters. \n【16】 Gliotransmission can also occur between two types of glial cells: astrocytes and microglia.    Calcium waves within the intracellular matrix of the astrocyte can cause a response in microglia with the presence of ATP in the extracellular matrix.  One study demonstrated that a mechanical stimulation caused astrocytes to release ATP, which in turn caused a delayed calcium response in microglia, suggesting that astrocyte-to-microglia communication could be mediated by ATP.\n【17】 Communication between astrocytes and neurons is very important in neuronal function.   The “tripartite synapse” is that most common example of intercellular communication between astrocytes and neurons, and involves the pre- and postsynaptic terminals of two neurons and one astrocyte.  Astrocytes have the ability to modulate neuronal activity, either causing exciting or inhibiting synaptic transmission, depending on the type of gliotransmitter released, specifically glutamate, which typically has excitatory influence on neurons, or ATP, which has shown to typically inhibit certain presynaptic functions of neurons. \n【18】 # Tripartite Synapse\n【19】 The fact that the release of gliotransmitters via elevations in calcium causes synaptic transmission leads to the idea of the “tripartite synapse.”    The tripartite synapse involves the localization of astrocytes and synapses and is a concept of synaptic physiology in which there are three parts of a synapse:  the presynaptic terminal, the postsynaptic terminal, and an astrocyte in between them.   One model of the tripartite synapse shows the presynaptic and postsynaptic terminals lying adjacent to each other, which the astrocyte is wrapped around the postsynaptic terminal.   However, localization and spatial distribution of the three elements of the tripartite synapse vary in different regions of the brain.  Potassium channels between the astrocyte and the presynaptic terminal make it possible to release K+ ions and avoid accumulation after neuronal activity.  Also, the release of neurotransmitters from presynaptic vesicles activates metabotropic receptors on the astrocyte, which then causes the astrocyte’s release of gliotransmitters from the cell. \n【20】 The astrocyte is bidirectional, meaning that is can communicate and exchange information with both pre- and postsynaptic elements. Communication is primarily controlled by the change in Ca2+ concentrations, causing excitability within the astrocyte.  The capability of a human to respond to change in both the external and internal environment is increased due to the hormonal regulation of the tripartite synapse. \n【21】 # Roles in Health and Disease\n【22】 It is believed that an increase in gliotransmission may contribute to epilepsy, while a decrease may contribute to schizophrenia.   Also, counting the number of astrocytes has proven to be useful; patients with depression are shown to have a lower astrocyte cell count. Further research and understanding of the correlation between gliotransmission and neurological disorders could lead to new targets for therapeutic treatment in the brain. Studies have also shown that increased and decreased stimulation of NMDARs, which is controlled by astrocytes, play a role in various neurodegenerative disorders.  These include Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and Huntington’s diseases as well as schizophrenia, stroke, and epilepsy. \n【23】 It is believed that certain neurodegenerative disorders, particularly schizophrenia and epilepsy, may be partially caused by varying levels of gliotransmission and calcium excitability.   One theory, called the glutamate hypothesis of schizophrenia, suggests that glutamate deficiency, which leads to the dysfunction of NMDARs at the presynaptic terminal, is believed to cause symptoms of schizophrenia. According to research, this hypofunctionality of NMDARs has been shown to be caused by lower amounts of gliotransmission facilitated by D-serine.  The fact that cycloserine, which acts as an agonist for the NMDAR’s binding site, is used in the treatment for patients with schizophrenia further supports the glutamate hypothesis.  In the case of epilepsy, it is known that glutamate plays a role in synchronous depolarizations.    This has led researchers to believe that excitation of epileptic discharges may be caused by the glutamate-mediated gliotransmission.  Although that some studies show that the all excitations caused by gliotransmission lead to epileptic discharges, but it could possibly increase the intensity of length of epileptiform activity.  \n【24】 The 5 first mentioned transmitters are primarily excitatory and can thus lead to neural apoptosis through excitotoxicity when expressed at large amounts. From neurodegenerative diseases, there is evidence at least for Alzheimer's disease that point to increased glial activation and amount (both glia and astrocyte) which accompanies simultaneous decrease in the amount of neurons . Excess quantities of the gliotransmitter TNF, documented in the cerebrospinal fluid in Alzheimer's disease, are hypothesized to play a role in the pathogenesis of this disorder, perhaps by dysregulating synaptic mechanisms which are modulated by TNF .", "title": "Gliotransmitter", "tags": "", "lang": "", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"id\": \"e9e660937aa4c7592113028a175d0862da503605\", \"overview\": \"None\", \"url\": \"https://www.wikidoc.org/index.php/Gliotransmitter\", \"source\": \"wikidoc\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-01-28 23:08:00", "update_time": "2024-02-18 19:34:00"}

Under permissive conditions of temperature and (usually high) moisture, these spores germinate, grow as hyphae and colonize the insect's cuticle; eventually they bore through it and reach the insects' body cavity (hemocoel). Then, the fungal cells proliferate in the host body cavity, usually as walled hyphae or in the form of wall-less protoplasts (depending on the fungus involved). After some time the insect is usually killed (sometimes by fungal toxins) and new propagules (spores) are formed in/on the insect if environmental conditions are again permissive; usually high humidity is required for sporulation.\n【5】 # Groups\n【6】 The entomopathogenic fungi include taxa from several of the main fungal groups and do not form a monophyletic group.

Fecainide is also indicated for the treatment of documented ventricular arrhythmias, such as sustained VT. There is a Black Box Warning for this drug as shown here.  Common adverse reactions include palpitations, nausea, dizziness, headache, blurred vision, photopsia, dyspnea, and fatigue.\n【6】 # Adult Indications and Dosage\n【7】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Adult)\n【8】 - For patients with sustained VT, no matter what their cardiac status, flecainide, like other antiarrhythmics, should be initiated in-hospital with rhythm monitoring.\n【9】 - Flecainide has a long half-life (12 to 27 hours in patients). Steady-state plasma levels, in patients with normal renal and hepatic function, may not be achieved until the patient has received 3 to 5 days of therapy at a given dose. Therefore, increases in dosage should be made no more frequently than once every four days, since during the first 2 to 3 days of therapy the optimal effect of a given dose may not be achieved.\n【10】 - Intravenous lidocaine has been used occasionally with flecainide while awaiting the therapeutic effect of flecainide. No adverse drug interactions were apparent. However, no formal studies have been performed to demonstrate the usefulness of this regimen.\n【11】 - An occasional patient not adequately controlled by (or intolerant to) a dose given at 12 hour intervals may be dosed at eight-hour intervals.\n【12】 - Once adequate control of the arrhythmia has been achieved, it may be possible in some patients to reduce the dose as necessary to minimize side effects or effects on conduction. In such patients, efficacy at the lower dose should be evaluated.\n【13】 - Flecainide should be used cautiously in patients with a history of CHF or myocardial dysfunction.\n【14】 - Any use of flecainide in children should be directly supervised by a cardiologist skilled in the treatment of arrhythmias in children. Because of the evolving nature of information in this area, specialized literature should be consulted. Under six months of age, the initial starting dose of flecainide in children is approximately 50 mg/M2 body surface area daily, divided into two or three equally spaced doses. Over six months of age, the initial starting dose may be increased to 100 mg/M2 per day. The maximum recommended dose is 200 mg/M2 per day. This dose should not be exceeded. In some children on higher doses, despite previously low plasma levels, the level has increased rapidly to far above therapeutic values while taking the same dose. Small changes in dose may also lead to disproportionate increases in plasma levels. Plasma trough (less than one hour pre-dose) flecainide levels and electrocardiograms should be obtained at presumed steady state (after at least five doses) either after initiation or change in flecainide dose, whether the dose was increased for lack of effectiveness, or increased growth of the patient. For the first year on therapy, whenever the patient is seen for reasons of clinical follow-up, it is suggested that a 12 lead electrocardiogram and plasma trough flecainide level are obtained. The usual therapeutic level of flecainide in children is 200 to 500 ng/mL. In some cases, levels as high as 800 ng/mL may be required for control.\n【15】 - In patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance of 35 mL/min/1.73 square meters or less), the initial dosage should be 100 mg once daily (or 50 mg bid); when used in such patients, frequent plasma level monitoring is required to guide dosage adjustments (seePlasma Level Monitoring). In patients with less severe renal disease, the initial dosage should be 100 mg every 12 hours; plasma level monitoring may also be useful in these patients during dosage adjustment. In both groups of patients, dosage increases should be made very cautiously when plasma levels have plateaued (after more than four days), observing the patient closely for signs of adverse cardiac effects or other toxicity. It should be borne in mind that in these patients it may take longer than four days before a new steady-state plasma level is reached following a dosage change.\n【16】 - Based on theoretical considerations, rather than experimental data, the following suggestion is made: when transferring patients from another antiarrhythmic drug to flecainide allow at least two to four plasma half-lives to elapse for the drug being discontinued before starting flecainide at the usual dosage. In patients where withdrawal of a previous antiarrhythmic agent is likely to produce life-threatening arrhythmias, the physician should consider hospitalizing the patient.\n【17】 - When flecainide is given in the presence of amiodarone, reduce the usual flecainide dose by 50% and monitor the patient closely for adverse effects. Plasma level monitoring is strongly recommended to guide dosage with such combination therapy.\n【18】 - Dosing Information\n【19】 - 50 mg every 12 hours\n【20】 - Flecainide acetate doses may be increased in increments of 50 mg bid every four days until efficacy is achieved.\n【21】 - For PAF patients, a substantial increase in efficacy without a substantial increase in discontinuations for adverse experiences may be achieved by increasing the flecainide acetate dose from 50 to 100 mg bid.\n【22】 - The maximum recommended dose for patients with paroxysmal supraventricular arrhythmias is 300 mg/day.\n【23】 - Dosing Information\n【24】 - 100 mg every 12 hours\n【25】 - This dose may be increased in increments of 50 mg bid every four days until efficacy is achieved.\n【26】 - Most patients with sustained VT do not require more than 150 mg every 12 hours (300 mg/day) and the maximum dose recommended is 400 mg/day.\n【27】 - In patients with sustained VT, use of higher initial doses and more rapid dosage adjustments have resulted in an increased incidence of proarrhythmic events and CHF, particularly during the first few days of dosing. Therefore, a loading dose is not recommended.\n【28】 ## Off-Label Use and Dosage (Adult)\n【29】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\n【30】 There is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Flecainide in adult patients.\n【31】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n【32】 - Dosing Information\n【33】 - 100 mg or 150 mg twice daily\n【34】 - Dosing Information\n【35】 - Maternal administration of oral flecainide 100 milligrams 3 to 4 times daily\n【36】 - Flecainide should be considered a second-line agent for the treatment of supraventricular arrhythmias. Its efficacy is not absolute for any arrhythmia and its proarrhythmia effects may counteract any beneficial effect.\n【37】 # Pediatric Indications and Dosage\n【38】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Pediatric)\n【39】 - The safety and efficacy of flecainide in the fetus, infant, or child have not been established in double-blind, randomized, placebo–controlled trials. The proarrhythmic effects of flecainide, as described previously, apply also to children. In pediatric patients with structural heart disease, flecainide has been associated with cardiac arrest and sudden death. Flecainide should be started in the hospital with rhythm monitoring. Any use of flecainide in children should be directly supervised by a cardiologist skilled in the treatment of arrhythmias in children.\n【40】 ## Off-Label Use and Dosage (Pediatric)\n【41】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\n【42】 There is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Flecainide in pediatric patients.\n【43】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n【44】 - Dosing Information\n【45】 - Oral doses of 2.8 mg/kg/day in 2 divided doses 12 hours apart were used initially.\n【46】 - The dose was increased to 5.6 mg/kg/day if control was not achieved after 3 days.\n【47】 # Contraindications\n【48】 - Flecainide is contraindicated in patients with pre-existing second- or third-degree AV block, or with right bundle branch block when associated with a left hemiblock (bifascicular block), unless a pacemaker is present to sustain the cardiac rhythm should complete heart block occur. Flecainide is also contraindicated in the presence of cardiogenic shock or known hypersensitivity to the drug.\n【49】 # Warnings\n【50】 - Proarrhythmic Effects\n【51】 - Flecainide, like other antiarrhythmic agents, can cause new or worsened supraventricular or ventricular arrhythmias. Ventricular proarrhythmic effects range from an increase in frequency of PVCs to the development of more severe ventricular tachycardia, e.g., tachycardia that is more sustained or more resistant to conversion to sinus rhythm, with potentially fatal consequences. In studies of ventricular arrhythmia patients treated with flecainide, three-fourths of proarrhythmic events were new or worsened ventricular tachyarrhythmias, the remainder being increased frequency of PVCs or new supraventricular arrhythmias. In patients treated with flecainide for sustained ventricular tachycardia, 80% (51/64) of proarrhythmic events occurred within 14 days of the onset of therapy. In studies of 225 patients with supraventricular arrhythmia (108 with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia and 117 with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation), there were 9 (4%) proarrhythmic events, 8 of them in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Of the 9, 7 (including the one in a PSVT patient) were exacerbations of supraventricular arrhythmias (longer duration, more rapid rate, harder to reverse) while 2 were ventricular arrhythmias, including one fatal case of VT/VF and one wide complex VT (the patient showed inducible VT, however, after withdrawal of flecainide), both in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and known coronary artery disease.\n【52】 - It is uncertain if flecainide's risk of proarrhythmia is exaggerated in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation (CAF), high ventricular rate, and/or exercise. Wide complex tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation have been reported in two of 12 CAF patients undergoing maximal exercise tolerance testing.\n【53】 - In patients with complex ventricular arrhythmias, it is often difficult to distinguish a spontaneous variation in the patient's underlying rhythm disorder from drug-induced worsening, so that the following occurrence rates must be considered approximations. Their frequency appears to be related to dose and to the underlying cardiac disease.\n【54】 - Among patients treated for sustained VT (who frequently also had CHF, a low ejection fraction, a history of myocardial infarction and/or an episode of cardiac arrest), the incidence of proarrhythmic events was 13% when dosage was initiated at 200 mg/day with slow upward titration, and did not exceed 300 mg/day in most patients. In early studies in patients with sustained VT utilizing a higher initial dose (400 mg/day) the incidence of proarrhythmic events was 26%; moreover, in about 10% of the patients treated proarrhythmic events resulted in death, despite prompt medical attention. With lower initial doses, the incidence of proarrhythmic events resulting in death decreased to 0.5% of these patients. Accordingly, it is extremely important to follow the recommended dosage schedule.\n【55】 - The relatively high frequency of proarrhythmic events in patients with sustained VT and serious underlying heart disease, and the need for careful titration and monitoring, requires that therapy of patients with sustained VT be started in the hospital.\n【56】 - Heart Failure\n【57】 - Flecainide has a negative inotropic effect and may cause or worsen CHF, particularly in patients with cardiomyopathy, preexisting severe heart failure (NYHA functional class III or IV) or low ejection fractions (less than 30%). In patients with supraventricular arrhythmias new or worsened CHF developed in 0.4% (1/225) of patients. In patients with sustained ventricular tachycardia during a mean duration of 7.9 months of flecainide therapy, 6.3% (20/317) developed new CHF. In patients with sustained ventricular tachycardia and a history of CHF, during a mean duration of 5.4 months of flecainide therapy, 25.7% (78/304) developed worsened CHF. Exacerbation of preexisting CHF occurred more commonly in studies which included patients with class III or IV failure than in studies which excluded such patients. Flecainide should be used cautiously in patients who are known to have a history of CHF or myocardial dysfunction. The initial dosage in such patients should be no more than 100 mg bid and patients should be monitored carefully. Close attention must be given to maintenance of cardiac function, including optimization of digitalis, diuretic, or other therapy. In cases where CHF has developed or worsened during treatment with flecainide, the time of onset has ranged from a few hours to several months after starting therapy. Some patients who develop evidence of reduced myocardial function while on flecainide can continue on flecainide with adjustment of digitalis or diuretics, others may require dosage reduction or discontinuation of flecainide. When feasible, it is recommended that plasma flecainide levels be monitored. Attempts should be made to keep trough plasma levels below 0.7 to 1.0 mcg/mL.\n【58】 - Effects on Cardiac Conduction\n【59】 - Flecainide slows cardiac conduction in most patients to produce dose-related increases in PR, QRS, and QT intervals.\n【60】 - PR interval increases on average about 25% (0.04 seconds) and as much as 118% in some patients. Approximately one-third of patients may develop new first-degree AV heart block (PR interval ≥ 0.20 seconds). The QRS complex increases on average about 25% (0.02 seconds) and as much as 150% in some patients. Many patients develop QRS complexes with a duration of 0.12 seconds or more. In one study, 4% of patients developed new bundle branch block while on flecainide. The degree of lengthening of PR and QRS intervals does not predict either efficacy or the development of cardiac adverse effects. In clinical trials, it was unusual for PR intervals to increase to 0.30 seconds or more, or for QRS intervals to increase to 0.18 seconds or more. Thus, caution should be used when such intervals occur, and dose reductions may be considered. The QT interval widens about 8%, but most of this widening (about 60% to 90%) is due to widening of the QRS duration. The JT interval (QT minus QRS) only widens about 4% on the average. Significant JT prolongation occurs in less than 2% of patients. There have been rare cases of Torsade de Pointes-type arrhythmia associated with flecainide therapy.\n【61】 - Clinically significant conduction changes have been observed at these rates: sinus node dysfunction such as sinus pause, sinus arrest and symptomatic bradycardia (1.2%), second-degree AV block (0.5%) and third-degree AV block (0.4%). An attempt should be made to manage the patient on the lowest effective dose in an effort to minimize these effects. If second- or third-degree AV block, or right bundle branch block associated with a left hemiblock occur, flecainide therapy should be discontinued unless a temporary or implanted ventricular pacemaker is in place to ensure an adequate ventricular rate.\n【62】 - Sick Sinus Syndrome (Bradycardia-Tachycardia Syndrome)\n【63】 - Flecainide should be used only with extreme caution in patients with sick sinus syndrome because it may cause sinus bradycardia, sinus pause, or sinus arrest.\n【64】 - Effects on Pacemaker Thresholds\n【65】 - Flecainide is known to increase endocardial pacing thresholds and may suppress ventricular escape rhythms. These effects are reversible if flecainide is discontinued. It should be used with caution in patients with permanent pacemakers or temporary pacing electrodes and should not be administered to patients with existing poor thresholds or non-programmable pacemakers unless suitable pacing rescue is available.\n【66】 - The pacing threshold in patients with pacemakers should be determined prior to instituting therapy with flecainide, again after one week of administration and at regular intervals thereafter. Generally, threshold changes are within the range of multiprogrammable pacemakers and, when these occur, a doubling of either voltage or pulse width is usually sufficient to regain capture.\n【67】 - Electrolyte Disturbances\n【68】 - Hypokalemia or hyperkalemia may alter the effects of Class I antiarrhythmic drugs. Preexisting hypokalemia or hyperkalemia should be corrected before administration of flecainide.\n【69】 - Pediatric Use\n【70】 - The safety and efficacy of flecainide in the fetus, infant, or child have not been established in double-blind, randomized, placebo–controlled trials. The proarrhythmic effects of flecainide, as described previously, apply also to children. In pediatric patients with structural heart disease, flecainide has been associated with cardiac arrest and sudden death. Flecainide should be started in the hospital with rhythm monitoring. Any use of flecainide in children should be directly supervised by a cardiologist skilled in the treatment of arrhythmias in children.\n【71】 # Adverse Reactions\n【72】 ## Clinical Trials Experience\n【73】 There is limited information regarding Clinical Trial Experience of Flecainide in the drug label.\n【74】 ## Postmarketing Experience\n【75】 - In post-myocardial infarction patients with asymptomatic PVCs and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, flecainide therapy was found to be associated with a 5.1% rate of death and non-fatal cardiac arrest, compared with a 2.3% rate in a matched placebo group.\n【76】 - Adverse effects reported for flecainide, were new or worsened arrhythmias which occurred in 1% of 108 patients with PSVT and in 7% of 117 patients with PAF; and new or exacerbated ventricular arrhythmias which occurred in 7% of 1330 patients with PVCs, non-sustained or sustained VT. In patients treated with flecainide for sustained VT, 80% (51/64) of proarrhythmic events occurred within 14 days of the onset of therapy. 198 patients with sustained VT experienced a 13% incidence of new or exacerbated ventricular arrhythmias when dosage was initiated at 200 mg/day with slow upward titration, and did not exceed 300 mg/day in most patients. In some patients, flecainide treatment has been associated with episodes of unresuscitatable VT or ventricular fibrillation (cardiac arrest). New or worsened CHF occurred in 6.3% of 1046 patients with PVCs, non-sustained or sustained VT. Of 297 patients with sustained VT, 9.1% experienced new or worsened CHF. New or worsened CHF was reported in 0.4% of 225 patients with supraventricular arrhythmias. There have also been instances of second- (0.5%) or third-degree (0.4%) AV block. Patients have developed sinus bradycardia, sinus pause, or sinus arrest, about 1.2% altogether. The frequency of most of these serious adverse events probably increases with higher trough plasma levels, especially when these trough levels exceed 1 mcg/mL.\n【77】 - There have been rare reports of isolated elevations of serum alkaline phosphatase and isolated elevations of serum transaminase levels. These elevations have been asymptomatic and no cause and effect relationship with flecainide has been established. In foreign postmarketing surveillance studies, there have been rare reports of hepatic dysfunction including reports of cholestasis and liver failure, and extremely rare reports of blood dyscrasias. Although no cause and effect relationship has been established, it is advisable to discontinue flecainide in patients who develop unexplained jaundice or signs of hepatic dysfunction or blood dyscrasias in order to eliminate flecainide as the possible causative agent.\n【78】 - Incidence figures for other adverse effects in patients with ventricular arrhythmias are based on a multicenter efficacy study, utilizing starting doses of 200 mg/day with gradual upward titration to 400 mg/day. Patients were treated for an average of 4.7 months, with some receiving up to 22 months of therapy. In this trial, 5.4% of patients discontinued due to non-cardiac adverse effects.\n【79】 - The following additional adverse experiences, possibly related to flecainide therapy and occurring in 1% to less than 3% of patients, have been reported in acute and chronic studies:\n【80】 Malaise, fever\n【81】 Tachycardia, sinus pause or arrest\n【82】 Vomiting, diarrhea, dyspepsia, anorexia\n【83】 Hypoesthesia, paresthesia, paresis, ataxia, flushing, increased sweating, vertigo, syncope, somnolence, tinnitus\n【84】 Rash\n【85】 Diplopia\n【86】 Anxiety, insomnia, depression\n【87】 - The following additional adverse experiences, possibly related to flecainide, have been reported in less than 1% of patients:\n【88】 Swollen lips, tongue and mouth; arthralgia, bronchospasm, myalgia\n【89】 Angina pectoris, second-degree and third-degree AV block, bradycardia, hypertension, hypotension\n【90】 Flatulence\n【91】 Leukopenia, granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia\n【92】 Amnesia, confusion, decreased libido, depersonalization, euphoria, morbid dreams, apathy\n【93】 Twitching, weakness, taste alteration, dry mouth, convulsions, impotence, speech disorder, stupor, neuropathy\n【94】 Pneumonitis, pulmonary infiltration\n【95】 Urticaria, exfoliative dermatitis, pruritus, alopecia\n【96】 Eye pain or irritation, photophobia, nystagmus\n【97】 Polyuria, urinary retention\n【98】 # Drug Interactions\n【99】 - Flecainide has been administered to patients receiving digitalis preparations or beta-adrenergic blocking agents without adverse effects. During administration of multiple oral doses of flecainide to healthy subjects stabilized on a maintenance dose of digoxin, a 13% to 19% increase in plasma digoxin levels occurred at six hours postdose.\n【100】 - In a study involving healthy subjects receiving flecainide and propranolol concurrently, plasma flecainide levels were increased about 20% and propranolol levels were increased about 30% compared to control values. In this formal interaction study, flecainide and propranololwere each found to have negative inotropic effects; when the drugs were administered together, the effects were additive. The effects of concomitant administration of flecainide and propranolol on the PR interval were less than additive. In flecainide clinical trials, patients who were receiving beta blockers concurrently did not experience an increased incidence of side effects. Nevertheless, the possibility of additive negative inotropic effects of beta blockers and flecainide should be recognized.\n【101】 - Flecainide is not extensively bound to plasma proteins. In vitro studies with several drugs which may be administered concomitantly showed that the extent of flecainide binding to human plasma proteins is either unchanged or only slightly less. Consequently, interactions with other drugs which are highly protein bound (e.g., anticoagulants) would not be expected. Flecainide has been used in a large number of patients receiving diuretics without apparent interaction. Limited data in patients receiving known enzyme inducers (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine) indicate only a 30% increase in the rate of flecainide elimination. In healthy subjects receiving cimetidine (1 gm daily) for one week, plasma flecainide levels increased by about 30% and half-life increased by about 10%.\n【102】 - When amiodarone is added to flecainide therapy, plasma flecainide levels may increase two-fold or more in some patients, if flecainide dosage is not reduced.\n【103】 - Drugs that inhibit cytochrome P4502D6, such as quinidine, might increase the plasma concentrations of flecainide in patients that are on chronic flecainide therapy; especially if these patients are extensive metabolizers.\n【104】 - There has been little experience with the coadministration of flecainide and either disopyramide or verapamil. Because both of these drugs have negative inotropic properties and the effects of coadministration with flecainide are unknown, neither disopyramide norverapamil should be administered concurrently with flecainide unless, in the judgment of the physician, the benefits of this combination outweigh the risks. There has been too little experience with the coadministration of flecainide with nifedipine or diltiazem to recommend concomitant use.\n【105】 # Use in Specific Populations\n【106】 ### Pregnancy\n【107】 Pregnancy Category (FDA):\n【108】 - Pregnancy Category C\n【109】 - Flecainide has been shown to have teratogenic effects (club paws, sternebrae and vertebrae abnormalities, pale hearts with contracted ventricular septum) and an embryotoxic effect (increased resorptions) in one breed of rabbit (New Zealand White) when given doses of 30 and 35 mg/kg/day, but not in another breed of rabbit (Dutch Belted) when given doses up to 30 mg/kg/day. No teratogenic effects were observed in rats and mice given doses up to 50 and 80 mg/kg/day, respectively; however, delayed sternebral and vertebral ossification was observed at the high dose in rats. Because there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women, flecainide should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\n【110】 Pregnancy Category (AUS):\n【111】 - Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) Pregnancy Category\n【112】 There is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Flecainide in women who are pregnant.\n【113】 ### Labor and Delivery\n【114】 - It is not known whether the use of flecainide during labor or delivery has immediate or delayed adverse effects on the mother or fetus, affects the duration of labor or delivery, or increases the possibility of forceps delivery or other obstetrical intervention.\n【115】 ### Nursing Mothers\n【116】 - Results from a multiple dose study conducted in mothers soon after delivery indicates that flecainide is excreted in human breast milk in concentrations as high as 4 times (with average levels about 2.5 times) corresponding plasma levels; assuming a maternal plasma level at the top of the therapeutic range (1 mcg/mL), the calculated daily dose to a nursing infant (assuming about 700 mL breast milk over 24 hours) would be less than 3 mg.\n【117】 ### Pediatric Use\n【118】 - The safety and efficacy of flecainide in the fetus, infant, or child have not been established in double-blind, randomized, placebocontrolled trials.\n【119】 ### Geriatic Use\n【120】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of Flecainide with respect to geriatric patients.\n【121】 ### Gender\n【122】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of Flecainide with respect to specific gender populations.\n【123】 ### Race\n【124】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of Flecainide with respect to specific racial populations.\n【125】 ### Renal Impairment\n【126】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of Flecainide in patients with renal impairment.\n【127】 ### Hepatic Impairment\n【128】 - Since flecainide elimination from plasma can be markedly slower in patients with significant hepatic impairment, flecainide should not be used in such patients unless the potential benefits clearly outweigh the risks. If used, frequent and early plasma level monitoring is required to guide dosage; dosage increases should be made very cautiously when plasma levels have plateaued (after more than four days).\n【129】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\n【130】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of Flecainide in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n【131】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\n【132】 There is no FDA guidance one the use of Flecainide in patients who are immunocompromised.\n【133】 # Administration and Monitoring\n【134】 ### Administration\n【135】 - Oral\n【136】 - Intravenous\n【137】 ### Monitoring\n【138】 - Plasma Level Monitoring\n【139】 - The large majority of patients successfully treated with flecainide were found to have trough plasma levels between 0.2 and 1 mcg/mL. The probability of adverse experiences, especially cardiac, may increase with higher trough plasma levels, especially when these exceed 1 mcg/mL. Periodic monitoring of trough plasma levels may be useful in patient management. Plasma level monitoring is required in patients with severe renal failure or severe hepatic disease, since elimination of flecainide from plasma may be markedly slower. Monitoring of plasma levels is strongly recommended in patients on concurrent amiodarone therapy and may also be helpful in patients with CHF and in patients with moderate renal disease.\n【140】 # IV Compatibility\n【141】 There is limited information regarding IV Compatibility of Flecainide in the drug label.\n【142】 # Overdosage\n【143】 ## Acute Overdose\n【144】 ### Signs and Symptoms\n【145】 - Untoward effects in these cases included nausea and vomiting, convulsions, hypotension, bradycardia, syncope, extreme widening of the QRS complex, widening of the QT interval, widening of the PR interval, ventricular tachycardia, AV nodal block, asystole, bundle branch block, cardiac failure, and cardiac arrest. The spectrum of events observed in fatal cases was much the same as that seen in the non-fatal cases. Death has resulted following ingestion of as little as 1000 mg; concomitant overdose of other drugs and/or alcohol in many instances undoubtedly contributed to the fatal outcome.\n【146】 ### Management\n【147】 - Treatment of overdosage should be supportive and may include the following: removal of unabsorbed drug from the gastrointestinal tract, administration of inotropic agents or cardiac stimulants such as dopamine, dobutamine or isoproterenol; mechanically assisted respiration; circulatory assists such as intra-aortic balloon pumping; and transvenous pacing in the event of conduction block. Because of the long plasma half-life of flecainide (12 to 27 hours in patients receiving usual doses), and the possibility of markedly non-linear elimination kinetics at very high doses, these supportive treatments may need to be continued for extended periods of time.\n【148】 - No specific antidote has been identified for the treatment of flecainide overdosage. Overdoses ranging up to 8000 mg have been survived, with peak plasma flecainide concentrations as high as 5.3 mcg/mL.\n【149】 - Hemodialysis is not an effective means of removing flecainide from the body. Since flecainide elimination is much slower when urine is very alkaline (pH 8 or higher), theoretically, acidification of urine to promote drug excretion may be beneficial in overdose cases with very alkaline urine. There is no evidence that acidification from normal urinary pH increases excretion.\n【150】 ## Chronic Overdose\n【151】 There is limited information regarding Chronic Overdose of Flecainide in the drug label.\n【152】 # Pharmacology\n【153】 ## Mechanism of Action\n【154】 - Flecainide has local anesthetic activity and belongs to the membrane stabilizing (Class 1) group of antiarrhythmic agents; it has electrophysiologic effects characteristic of the IC class of antiarrhythmics.\n【155】 - In man, flecainide produces a dose-related decrease in intracardiac conduction in all parts of the heart with the greatest effect on the His-Purkinje system (H-V conduction). Effects upon atrioventricular (AV) nodal conduction time and intra-atrial conduction times, although present, are less pronounced than those on ventricular conduction velocity. Significant effects on refractory periods were observed only in the ventricle. Sinus node recovery times (corrected) following pacing and spontaneous cycle lengths are somewhat increased. This latter effect may become significant in patients with sinus node dysfunction.\n【156】 - Flecainide causes a dose-related and plasma-level related decrease in single and multiple PVCs and can suppress recurrence of ventricular tachycardia. In limited studies of patients with a history of ventricular tachycardia, flecainide has been successful 30 to 40% of the time in fully suppressing the inducibility of arrhythmias by programmed electrical stimulation. Based on PVC suppression, it appears that plasma levels of 0.2 to 1 mcg/mL may be needed to obtain the maximal therapeutic effect. It is more difficult to assess the dose needed to suppress serious arrhythmias, but trough plasma levels in patients successfully treated for recurrent ventricular tachycardia were between 0.2 and 1 mcg/mL. Plasma levels above 0.7 to 1 mcg/mL are associated with a higher rate of cardiac adverse experiences such as conduction defects or bradycardia. The relation of plasma levels to proarrhythmic events is not established, but dose reduction in clinical trials of patients with ventricular tachycardia appears to have led to a reduced frequency and severity of such events.\n【157】 - Flecainide does not usually alter heart rate, although bradycardia and tachycardia have been reported occasionally.\n【158】 - In animals and isolated myocardium, a negative inotropic effect of flecainide has been demonstrated. Decreases in ejection fraction, consistent with a negative inotropic effect, have been observed after single administration of 200 to 250 mg of the drug in man; both increases and decreases in ejection fraction have been encountered during multidose therapy in patients at usual therapeutic doses.\n【159】 ## Structure\n【160】 - Flecainide acetate, USP is an antiarrhythmic drug available in tablets and is benzamide, N-(2-piperidinylmethyl)-2,5-bis(2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy)-monoacetate. The structural formula is as follows:\n【161】 - Flecainide acetate, USP is a white crystalline substance with a pKa of 9.3. It has an aqueous solubility of 48.4 mg/mL at 37°C.\n【162】 - Each tablet, for oral administration, contains 50 mg, 100 mg or 150 mg of flecainide acetate, USP. In addition, each tablet contains the following inactive ingredients: colloidal silicon dioxide, croscarmellose sodium, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline celulose, pregelatinized starch and sodium stearyl fumarate.\n【163】 ## Pharmacodynamics\n【164】 There is limited information regarding Pharmacodynamics of Flecainide in the drug label.\n【165】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n【166】 - Following oral administration, the absorption of flecainide is nearly complete. Peak plasma levels are attained at about three hours in most individuals (range, 1 to 6 hours). Flecainide does not undergo any consequential presystemic biotransformation (first-pass effect). Food or antacid do not affect absorption. Milk, however, may inhibit absorption in infants. A reduction in flecainide dosage should be considered when milk is removed from the diet of infants.\n【167】 - The apparent plasma half-life averages about 20 hours and is quite variable (range, 12 to 27 hours) after multiple oral doses in patients with premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). With multiple dosing, plasma levels increase because of its long half-life with steady-state levels approached in 3 to 5 days; once at steady-state, no additional (or unexpected) accumulation of drug in plasma occurs during chronic therapy. Over the usual therapeutic range, data suggest that plasma levels in an individual are approximately proportional to dose, deviating upwards from linearity only slightly (about 10 to 15% per 100 mg on average).\n【168】 - In healthy subjects, about 30% of a single oral dose (range, 10 to 50%) is excreted in urine as unchanged drug. The two major urinary metabolites are meta-O-dealkylated flecainide (active, but about one-fifth as potent) and the meta-O-dealkylated lactam of flecainide (non-active metabolite). These two metabolites (primarily conjugated) account for most of the remaining portion of the dose. Several minor metabolites (3% of the dose or less) are also found in urine; only 5% of an oral dose is excreted in feces. In patients, free (unconjugated) plasma levels of the two major metabolites are very low (less than 0.05 mcg/mL).\n【169】 - In vitro metabolic studies have confirmed that cytochrome P450IID6 is involved in the metabolism of flecainide.\n【170】 - When urinary pH is very alkaline (8 or higher), as may occur in rare conditions (e.g., renal tubular acidosis, strict vegetarian diet), flecainide elimination from plasma is much slower.\n【171】 - The elimination of flecainide from the body depends on renal function (i.e., 10 to 50% appears in urine as unchanged drug). With increasing renal impairment, the extent of unchanged drug excretion in urine is reduced and the plasma half-life of flecainide is prolonged. Since flecainide is also extensively metabolized, there is no simple relationship between creatinine clearance and the rate of flecanide elimination from plasma.\n【172】 - In patients with NYHA class III congestive heart failure (CHF), the rate of flecainide elimination from plasma (mean half-life, 19 hours) is moderately slower than for healthy subjects (mean half-life, 14 hours), but similar to the rate for patients with PVCs without CHF. The extent of excre- tion of unchanged drug in urine is also similar.\n【173】 - Under one year of age, currently available data are limited but suggest that the half-life at birth may be as long as 29 hours, decreasing to 11to 12 hours by three months of age and 6 hours by one year of age. The pharmacokinetics in hydropic infants have not been studied, but case reports suggest prolonged elimination. In children aged 1 year to 12 years the half-life is approximately 8 hours. In adolescents (age 12 to 15) the plasma elimination half-life is approximately 11 to 12 hours. Since milk may inhibit absorption in infants, a reduction in flecainide dosage should be considered when milk is removed from the diet (e.g., gastroenteritis, weaning). Plasma trough flecainide levels should be monitored during major changes in dietary milk intake.\n【174】 - From age 20 to 80, plasma levels are only slightly higher with advancing age; flecainide elimination from plasma is somewhat slower in elderly subjects than in younger subjects. Patients up to age 80+ have been safely treated with usual dosages.\n【175】 - The extent of flecainide binding to human plasma proteins is about 40% and is independent of plasma drug level over the range of 0.015 to about 3.4 mcg/mL. Thus, clinically significant drug interactions based on protein binding effects would not be expected.\n【176】 - Hemodialysis removes only about 1% of an oral dose as unchanged flecainide.\n【177】 - Small increases in plasma digoxin levels are seen during coadministration of flecainide with digoxin. Small increases in both flecainide and propranolol plasma levels are seen during coadministration of these two drugs.\n【178】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\n【179】 - Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\n【180】 - Long-term studies with flecainide in rats and mice at doses up to 60 mg/kg/day have not revealed any compound-related carcinogenic effects. Mutagenicity studies (Ames test, mouse lymphoma and in vivo cytogenetics) did not reveal any mutagenic effects. A rat reproduction study at doses up to 50 mg/kg/day (seven times the usual human dose) did not reveal any adverse effect on male or female fertility.\n【181】 # Clinical Studies\n【182】 - In two randomized, crossover, placebo-controlled clinical trials of 16 weeks double-blind duration, 79% of patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) receiving flecainide were attack free, whereas 15% of patients receiving placebo remained attack free. The median time-before-recurrence of PSVT in patients receiving placebo was 11 to 12 days, whereas over 85% of patients receiving flecainide had no recurrence at 60 days.\n【183】 - In two randomized, crossover, placebo-controlled clinical trials of 16 weeks double-blind duration, 31% of patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation/flutter (PAF) receiving flecainide were attack free, whereas 8% receiving placebo remained attack free. The median time-before-recurrence of PAF in patients receiving placebo was about 2 to 3 days, whereas for those receiving flecainide the median time-before-recurrence was 15 days.\n【184】 # How Supplied\n【185】 - Flecainide Acetate Tablets USP are available as:\n【186】 - 50 mg: White to off-white, round, flat-faced, beveled-edge, unscored tablet.

This may result from various conditions that develop before birth, such as:\n【13】 - Birth defects\n【14】 - Delay in clamping the umbilical cord\n【15】 - Diabetes in the baby's birth mother\n【16】 - Inherited diseases\n【17】 - Not enough oxygen reaching body tissues (hypoxia)\n【18】 - Twin-twin transfusion syndrome, which occurs when blood moves from one twin to the other.\n【19】 - The extra RBCs can block the flow of blood in the smallest blood vessels. This may lead to tissue death from lack of oxygen. This blocked blood flow can affect all organs, including the kidneys, lungs, and brain.\n【20】 # Diagnosis\n【21】 - There may be signs of breathing problems, kidney failure, and newborn jaundice.\n【22】 - If the baby has symptoms of hyperviscosity, a blood test to count the number of red blood cells will be done. This test is called a hematocrit.\n【23】 - Other tests may include:\n【24】 - Blood gases to check oxygen level in the blood\n【25】 - Blood sugar (glucose) to check for low blood sugar\n【26】 - Blood urea nitrogen (BUN), a substance that forms when protein breaks down\n【27】 - Creatinine, a substance produced by muscles that can build up in the blood if the kidneys aren't working properly\n【28】 - Urinalysis\n【29】 # Treatment options\n【30】 - The baby will be monitored for complications of hyperviscosity.\n【31】 - If needed, an exchange transfusion will be done to lower the amount of red blood cells that are moving through the baby's blood vessels.\n【32】 - Other treatment may include increasing body fluids.\n【33】 # Where to find medical care for Neonatal polycythemia?\n【34】 Directions to Hospitals Treating Neonatal polycythemia\n【35】 # What to expect (Outlook/Prognosis)?\n【36】 - The outlook is good for infants with mild hyperviscosity and those who receive treatment for severe hyperviscosity.\n【37】 - Some children may have mild changes in neurological development.

The histamine receptors act by increasing intracellular cAMP, whereas the muscarinic and gastrin receptors increase intracellular Ca2+ levels. Both cAMP and Ca2+ acts via protein kinases to increase the transport of acid into the stomach.\n【5】 Parietal cells contain an extensive secretory network (called canaliculi) from which the HCl is secreted by active transport into the stomach. The enzyme hydrogen potassium ATPase (H+/K+ ATPase) is unique to the parietal cells and transports the H+ against a concentration gradient of about 3 million to 1.\n【6】 Hydrochloric acid is formed in the following manner:\n【7】 - Hydrogen ions are formed from the dissociation of water molecules. The enzyme carbonic anhydrase converts one molecule of carbon dioxide and one molecule of water to a bicarbonate ion (HCO3-) and a hydrogen ion (H+).\n【8】 - The bicarbonate ion (HCO3-) is exchanged for a chloride ion (Cl-) on the basal side of the cell and the bicarbonate diffuses into the blood.\n【9】 - Potassium (K+) and chloride (Cl-) ions diffuse into the canaliculi.\n【10】 - Hydrogen ions are pumped out of the cell into the canaliculi in exchange for potassium ions, via the H+/K+ ATPase.\n【11】 The resulting highly-acidic environment causes proteins from food to unfold (or denature), exposing the peptide bonds that link together amino acids.  HCl also activates pepsin, allowing it to help digestion by breaking specific peptide bonds, a process known as proteolysis.  Furthermore, the sudden increase in gastric acid secretion following a meal can causes a physiological phenomenon called the alkaline tide, which is due to the production and export of bicarbonate from parietal cells.\n【12】 Parietal cells secrete acid in response to three types of stimuli:\n【13】 - H2 histamine receptors (most significant contribution)\n【14】 - parasympathetic activity via the Vagus nerve\n【15】 - gastrin (least significant contribution, but note that histamine secretion by ECL cells is due in part to gastrin)\n【16】 Upon stimulation, adenylate cyclase is activated within the parietal cells. This increases intracellular cyclic AMP, which leads to activation of protein kinase A. Protein kinase A phosphorylates proteins involved in the transport of H+/K+ ATPase from the cytoplasm to the cell membrane. This causes resorption of K+ ions and secretion of H+ ions. The pH of the secreted fluid can fall 'by' 0.8.\n【17】 # Intrinsic factor\n【18】 Parietal cells also produce intrinsic factor. Intrinsic factor is required for the absorption of ] in the diet. Atrophic Gastritis, in particular in the elderly,  will cause an inability to absorb B12 and can lead to deficiencies.\n【19】 # Diseases of parietal cells\n【20】 - Peptic ulcers can result from over-acidity in the stomach. Antacids can be used to enhance the natural tolerance of the gastric lining. Antimuscarinic drugs such as pirenzepine or H2 antihistamines can reduce acid secretion. Proton pump inhibitors are more potent at reducing gastric acid production since that is the final common pathway of all stimulation of acid production.\n【21】 - In pernicious anemia, autoantibodies directed against parietal cells or intrinsic factor cause a reduction in vitamin B12 absorption. It can be treated with injections of replacement vitamin B12 (hydroxocobalamin or cyanocobalamin).\n【22】 - Achlorhydria is another autoimmune disease of the parietal cells. The damaged parietal cells are unable to produce the required amount of gastric acid.

SCO1 localizes predominantly to blood vessels, whereas SCO2 is barely detectable, as well as to tissues with high levels of oxidative phosphorylation. Expression of SCO2 is also much higher than that of SCO1 in muscle tissue, while SCO1 is expressed at higher levels in liver tissue than SCO2. Mutations in both SCO1 and SCO2 are associated with distinct clinical phenotypes as well as tissue-specific cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV) deficiency. \n【2】 # Structure\n【3】 SCO1 is located on the p arm of chromosome 17 in position 13.1 and has 6 exons. The SCO1 gene produces a 33.8 kDa protein composed of 301 amino acids. The protein is a member of the SCO1/2 family. It contains 3 copper metal binding sites at positions 169, 173, and 260, a transit peptide, a 25 amino acid topological domain from positions 68-92, a 19 amino acid helical transmembrane domain from positions 93-111, and a 190 amino acid topological domain from positions 112-301 in the mitochondrial intermembrane. Additionally, SCO1 has been predicted to contain 10 beta strands, 7 helixes, and 2 turns and is a single-pass membrane protein.\n【4】 # Function\n【5】 Mammalian cytochrome c oxidase (COX) catalyzes the transfer of reducing equivalents from cytochrome c to molecular oxygen and pumps protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane. In yeast, 2 related COX assembly genes, SCO1 and SCO2 (synthesis of cytochrome c oxidase), enable subunits 1 and 2 to be incorporated into the holoprotein. This gene is the human homolog to the yeast SCO1 gene. It is predominantly expressed in muscle, heart, and brain tissues, which are also known for their high rates of oxidative phosphorylation. SCO1 is a copper metallochaperone that is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane and is important for the maturation and stabilization of cytochrome c oxidase subunit II (MT-CO2/COX2). It plays a role in the regulation of copper homeostasis by controlling the localization and abundance of CTR1 and is responsible for the transportation of copper to the Cu(A) site on MT-CO2/COX2.\n【6】 # Clinical relevance\n【7】 Mutations in the SCO1 gene are associated with hepatic failure and encephalopathy resulting from mitochondrial complex IV deficiency also known as cytochrome c oxidase deficiency. This is a disorder of the mitochondrial respiratory chain with heterogeneous clinical manifestations, ranging from isolated myopathy to severe multisystem disease affecting several tissues and organs. Features include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, hepatomegaly and liver dysfunction, hypotonia, muscle weakness, exercise intolerance, developmental delay, delayed motor development, mental retardation, and lactic acidosis. Some affected individuals manifest a fatal hypertrophic cardiomyopathy resulting in neonatal death. A subset of patients also suffer from Leigh syndrome. Specifically, cases of pathogenic SCO1 mutations have resulted in fatal infantile encephalopathy, neonatal-onset hepatic failure, and severe hepatopathy. The P174L and M294V mutations have been identified and implicated in these diseases and phenotypes. It has also been suggested that mutations in SCO1, as well as SCO2, can result in a cellular copper deficiency, which can occur separately from cytochrome c oxidase assembly defects.\n【8】 # Model organisms\n【9】 Model organisms have been used in the study of SCO1 function. A conditional knockout mouse line, called Sco1tm1a(KOMP)Wtsi was generated as part of the International Knockout Mouse Consortium program—a high-throughput mutagenesis project to generate and distribute animal models of disease.\n【10】 Male and female animals underwent a standardized phenotypic screen to determine the effects of deletion. Twenty two tests were carried out on mutant mice and two significant abnormalities were observed.  No homozygous mutant embryos were identified during gestation, and therefore none survived until weaning. The remaining tests were carried out on heterozygous mutant adult mice; no additional significant abnormalities were observed in these animals.\n【11】 # Interactions\n【12】 SCO1 has been shown to have 127 binary protein-protein interactions including 120 co-complex interactions. SCO1 interacts with COA6, TMEM177, COX20, COX16, COX17, WDR19, CIDEB, and UBC7.

This mode of inheritance is in contrast to the inheritance of traits on autosomal chromosomes, where both sexes have the same probability of expressing the trait. Since, in humans, there are many more genes on the X than there are on the Y, there are many more X-linked traits than there are Y-linked traits.\n【3】 In mammals, the female is the homogametic sex, having two X chromosomes (XX), while the male is heterogametic, having one X and one Y chromosome (XY). Genes that are present on the X or Y chromosome are called sex linked genes.\n【4】 X-linked recessive traits are expressed in all heterogametics, but only in those homogametics that are homozygous for the recessive allele. For example, an X-linked recessive allele in humans causes haemophilia. Haemophilia is much more common in males than females because males are hemizygous - they only have one copy of the gene in question - and therefore express the trait when they inherit one mutant allele. In contrast, a female must inherit two mutant alleles, a less frequent event since the mutant allele is rare in the population.\n【5】 The incidence of recessive X-linked phenotypes in females is the square of that in males (squaring a proportion less than one gives an outcome closer to 0 than the original). If 1 in 20 males in a human population are green color blind, then 1 in 400 females in the population are expected to be color blind (1/20)*(1/20).\n【6】 X-linked traits are maternally inherited from carrier mothers.  Each son born to a carrier mother has a 50% probability of inheriting the X-chromosome carrying the mutant allele.  There are a few Y-linked traits; these are inherited from the father.\n【7】 In classical genetics, a reciprocal cross is performed to test if a trait is sex-linked.\n【8】 ## X-linked recessive\n【9】 X-linked inherited diseases occur far more frequently in males because they only have one X chromosome. Females must receive a copy of the gene from both parents to have such a recessive disease. However, they will still be carriers if they receive one copy of the gene. Recessive genes on the X chromosome that cause serious diseases are usually passed from female carriers to their ill sons and carrier daughters. This is because males, who always have the disease and are not just carriers, would have to father a daughter to pass on the gene. This is unlikely because severe genetic diseases often cause death in childhood or early adulthood. Even those males who survive childhood are unlikely to father children because a sickly male will be less likely to find a mate. However, if the disease shows up late in life, or is not severe, he will pass the gene to all of his daughters. He can not pass it to his sons because a male receives his X chromosome from his mother. A mother with one copy of the gene has a 50% chance of passing it to her children of both sexes, but her daughters will just be carriers of the gene unless their father has it too.\n【10】 Diseases well known for their X-linked recessive inheritance are hemophilia (types A and B), and color blindness.\n【11】 ## X-linked dominant\n【12】 There are few examples of X-linked dominant diseases; the best known in this category is vitamin D resistant rickets. Other examples are:\n【13】 - Incontinentia pigmenti\n【14】 - Coffin-Lowry syndrome\n【15】 ## Y-linked\n【16】 - Various failures in the SRY genes\n【17】 cs:Dědičnost znaků a pohlaví\n【18】 it:Caratteri legati al sesso\n【19】 sr:Наслеђивање везано за X хромозом", "title": "Sex linkage", "tags": "", "lang": "", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"source\": \"wikidoc\", \"id\": \"deeb671e6df3eec6d762978c3ada32023e5c405b\", \"overview\": \"None\", \"url\": \"https://www.wikidoc.org/index.php/Sex-linked\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"type3": "无关文本#17#19#非英文"}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-01-28 23:08:00", "update_time": "2024-02-18 19:46:46"}

This involves removing the damaged disc and fixing parts of the spine together, to relieve pain.\n【2】 # Recommendations\n【3】 Current evidence on the safety of lateral (including extreme, extra and direct lateral) interbody fusion in the lumbar spine for low back pain shows there are serious but well-recognised complications. Evidence on efficacy is adequate in quality and quantity. Therefore, this procedure may be used provided that standard arrangements are in place for clinical governance, consent and audit.\n【4】 This procedure should only be done by surgeons with specific training in the technique, who should carry out their initial procedures with an experienced mentor.\n【5】 Clinicians should enter details about all patients having lateral interbody fusion in the lumbar spine for low back pain onto the British Spine Registry.# Indications and current treatments\n【6】 Chronic low back pain may result from degenerative changes in the intervertebral discs or spinal facet joints. Conservative treatments include analgesics, non‑steroidal anti-inflammatory medication and manual therapy.\n【7】 For people with severe, life-limiting, chronic low back pain that does not respond to conservative treatments, surgery may be appropriate. This may include bony fusion of vertebrae (to immobilise segments of the vertebral column thought to be responsible for back pain, using either a posterior or anterior approach) or inserting a prosthetic intervertebral disc (which preserves lumbar mobility to reduce the risk of degenerative changes in adjacent intervertebral disc spaces). Other surgical alternatives include non‑rigid stabilisation techniques.# The procedure\n【8】 The aim of lateral interbody fusion in the lumbar spine is to achieve spinal fusion by a side or lateral approach, to avoid the major muscle groups in the back (posterior approach) or the organs and blood vessels in the abdomen (anterior approach).\n【9】 The procedure is done with the patient under general anaesthesia. A probe is inserted laterally through the psoas muscle, under fluoroscopic guidance, to lie alongside the affected disc. A posterior incision is also sometimes made, to allow access for manipulation of the probe. Nerve monitoring is recommended by many specialists. Dilators are inserted around the probe and a retractor is positioned to give the surgeon direct access to the spine. A discectomy is carried out and a cage implant inserted to hold the vertebrae in position. A bone graft (usually from the hip) is inserted between the 2 vertebrae, sometimes with additional support from screws, plates or rods. The procedure may be done at more than 1 level during the same operation. A recent variation of this procedure is oblique lateral interbody fusion, which involves retroperitoneal access anterior to the psoas. It may take a few months before patients are able to return to their normal activities after the procedure.\n【10】 There are a number of different devices used for this procedure.# Efficacy\n【11】 This section describes efficacy outcomes from the published literature that the committee considered as part of the evidence about this procedure.

In a non-randomised comparative study of 202 patients treated by extreme lateral interbody fusion (LIF) or open anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF), low back pain scores, measured on a scale of 0–10, improved from 7.5 at baseline in both groups (n=95) to 2.4 and 2.6 respectively at 12‑month follow-up (n=61; p<0.001 compared with baseline; p=not significant for between group comparison). Mean leg pain, measured on a scale of 0–10, improved from 5.8 in the extreme LIF group and 5.4 in the ALIF group at baseline (n=95) to 1.6 and 2.0 respectively at 12‑month follow-up (n=61), in the same study (p<0.001 compared with baseline; p value not significant for between group comparison).\n【14】 In the systematic review of 237 articles, the weighted average for improvement in disability, measured on the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), was 48% (n=1,234 patients; 29 study arms). In the non-randomised comparative study of 202 patients treated by extreme LIF or ALIF, the ODI improved from 59% at baseline in both groups (n=95) to 23% and 24% respectively at 12‑month follow-up (n=61; p<0.001 compared with baseline; p value not significant for between group comparison). In a case series of 160 patients, the ODI improved from 44% at baseline to 23.5% at the last follow-up (mean follow-up 18.5 months; p value not reported).\n【15】 In the systematic review of 237 articles, the weighted average for patient satisfaction was 89% (n=491 patients; 9 study arms); 85% of patients said that they would have the procedure again if their outcome had been known in advance. In a randomised controlled trial (RCT) and non‑randomised comparative study of 55 patients treated by extreme LIF or transforaminal interbody fusion (TLIF), 91% and 80% of patients respectively were satisfied with their outcome at 24‑month follow-up (p=0.393) and 100% and 90% of patients respectively would be willing to have the same procedure had their outcome been known in advance (p=0.210). In a non-randomised comparative study of 208 patients treated by extreme LIF or ALIF, 95% (198/208) of patients were satisfied with the procedure and reported improvement; 10 patients did not improve or worsened (radiological and clinical results were similar in both groups).\n【16】 In the RCT and non‑randomised comparative study of 55 patients treated by extreme LIF or TLIF, mean quality-of-life scores for the SF‑36 physical component improved from 37.7 and 39.5 respectively at baseline to 61.4 and 64.9 at 24‑month follow-up (p<0.05 compared with baseline). Mean quality-of-life scores for the SF‑36 mental component improved from 51 and 52.2 respectively at baseline to 67.2 and 69.2 at 24‑month follow-up (p<0.05 compared with baseline). In the case series of 160 patients, the SF‑36 physical component score improved from 30.9 at baseline to 43.2 at the last follow-up (mean follow-up 18.5 months; p value not reported).\n【17】 The specialist advisers listed the key efficacy outcomes as patient reported outcome measures, including reduced pain, and radiological outcomes, including fusion of the lumbar spine and restoration of the disc height.# Safety\n【18】 This section describes safety outcomes from the published literature that the committee considered as part of the evidence about this procedure. For more detailed information on the evidence, see the interventional procedure overview.\n【19】 In a systematic review of 237 articles, the weighted averages for thigh side effects, hip flexion weakness and motor neural deficits were 26% (n=2,772), 21% (n=1,360 patients; 22 study arms) and 3% (n=1,568 patients; 14 study arms) respectively. In a systematic review of 34 studies, neurological adverse events (transient motor weakness, hypoaesthesia, transient or persistent thigh symptoms, injury to lumbosacral plexus, injury to femoral nerve) were reported. These occurred in 9% (209/2,342) of patients treated by extreme lateral interbody fusion (LIF) compared with 5% (27/544) of patients treated by anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF) when Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reports were excluded (p=0.0015) and in 9% (130/1,379) of patients treated by ALIF when FDA reports were included (p=0.605). In the extreme LIF group, 43% (90/209) of the neurological adverse events resolved within 3 months of the procedure, 16% (33/209) lasted between 3 months and 2 years or throughout the last follow-up; there was no information on the remaining 41% (86/209) of complications.\n【20】 Sensory deficit was reported in 27% (585/2,160) of patients treated by lateral lumbar interbody fusion (LLIF) compared with 20% (380/1,885) of patients treated by minimally-invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (MI‑LIF, p<0.0001) in a systematic review of 96 studies (n=9,714 patients). Temporary neurological deficit was reported in 9% (278/2,957) of patients treated by LLIF and 2% (30/1,349) of patients treated by MI-LIF (p<0.0001). Permanent neurological deficit was reported in 3% (62/2,525) and 1% (14/1,382) of patients respectively (p=0.002), in the same study.\n【21】 Postoperative hip flexion weakness was reported in 31% (9/29) of patients treated by extreme LIF and in no patients treated by transforaminal interbody fusion (TLIF) in a randomised controlled trial (RCT) and non-randomised comparative study of 55 patients (p<0.001); all resolved within 6 months. Postoperative distal motor weakness was reported in 3.5% (1/29) and 0% (0/26) of patients respectively (p=1.00) and sensory deficit was reported in 10% (3/29) and 8% (2/26) of patients respectively (p=1.00), in the same study; all resolved within 12 months.\n【22】 A partial and transient injury to the L5 nerve root during implant insertion at level L4–5 was reported in 1 patient treated by extreme LIF in a non-randomised comparative study of 208 patients; intraoperative nerve monitoring was not yet being used.\n【23】 The weighted average for reoperations was 6% (n=2,080 patients; 24 study arms) in the systematic review of 237 articles. A secondary surgical procedure (revisions, supplemental fixations, reoperations) was reported in 2% (40/2,342) of patients treated by extreme LIF compared with 5% (25/544) of patients treated by ALIF when FDA reports were excluded (p=0.0002) and in 9% (121/1,379) of patients treated by ALIF when FDA reports were included (p<0.0001) in the systematic review of 34 studies.\n【24】 Laceration of the abdominal aorta was reported in 1 patient in a case series of 900 patients; this was repaired through an exploratory laparotomy. Segmental vessel lacerations were reported in less than 1% (4/900) of patients in the same study; all were ligated under direct visualisation without further extension of the incision and no clinical sequelae. Major vascular injury was reported in a case report; a detachable retractor blade caused extensive damage to the iliac veins, the patient had massive blood loss and died a few weeks later from multiple organ failure secondary to septic shock. Lumbar artery pseudoaneurysm, which was successfully treated by embolisation, was reported in 1 patient in a case report.\n【25】 Wound-related complications (psoas haematoma, infection) were reported in less than 1% (15/2,342) of patients treated by extreme LIF, in less than 1% (7/544) of patients treated by ALIF when FDA reports were excluded (p=0.1438) and in 2% (26/1,379) of patients treated by ALIF when FDA reports were included (p=0.00067) in the systematic review of 34 studies.\n【26】 Gastrointestinal complications (ileus, gastric volvulus, bowel injury) were reported in 1% (25/2,342) of patients treated by extreme LIF, in less than 1% (3/544) of patients treated by ALIF when FDA reports were excluded (p=0.2771) and in 8% (116/1,379) of patients treated by ALIF when FDA reports were included (p<0.0001) in the systematic review of 34 studies. Ileus was reported in 7% (2/29) of patients treated by extreme LIF and in no patients treated by TLIF in the RCT and non‑randomised comparative study of 55 patients. Bowel perforation after extreme LIF was described in a case report: the patient had a temporary colostomy for 3 months before making a full recovery.\n【27】 Renal complications (urinary tract infection or urinary retention) were reported in 1% (12/2,342) of patients treated by extreme LIF, in no patients treated by ALIF when FDA reports were excluded (p=0.09) and in 1% (10/1,379) of patients treated by ALIF when FDA reports were included (p=0.4214) in the systematic review of 34 studies.\n【28】 Vertebral body fracture or remote compression fracture was reported in 1% (18/2,342) of patients treated by extreme LIF, in no patients treated by ALIF when FDA reports were excluded (p=0.0274) and in less than 1% (3/1,379) of patients treated by ALIF when FDA reports were included (p=0.0262) in the systematic review of 34 studies.\n【29】 Hardware failure (cage subsidence or breakage, intraoperative pedicle fracture, implant bone interface failure) was reported in 1% (31/2,342) of patients treated by extreme LIF, in 3% (17/544) of patients treated by ALIF when FDA reports were excluded (p=0.0065) and in 3% (47/1,379) of patients treated by ALIF when FDA reports were included (p<0.0001) in the systematic review of 34 studies. Graft migration and graft subsidence at 24‑month follow-up were reported in 0% (0/29) and 3% (1/29) of patients treated by extreme LIF and in 5% (1/21) and 10% (2/21) of patients treated by TLIF respectively in the RCT and non‑randomised comparative study of 55 patients.\n【30】 Complex regional pain syndrome was reported in 1 patient in a case report. The symptoms were treated conservatively and resolved within 8 weeks. Lumbar post-sympathectomy syndrome was reported in 5% (4/88) of patients treated by extreme LIF in the non‑randomised comparative study of 208 patients (at level L4/5 in 3 patients and at level L5/6 in 1 patient).\n【31】 In addition to safety outcomes reported in the literature, specialist advisers are asked about anecdotal adverse events (events which they have heard about) and about theoretical adverse events (events which they think might possibly occur, even if they have never done so). For this procedure, specialist advisers noted that spinal cord injury was an anecdotal adverse event.

When used, the null hypothesis is presumed true until statistical evidence in the form of a hypothesis test indicates otherwise.  In science, the null hypothesis is used to test differences in treatment and control groups, and the assumption at the outset of the experiment is that no difference exists between the two groups for the variable being compared.\n【3】 # Introduction\n【4】 The null hypothesis proposes something initially presumed true. It is rejected only when it becomes evidently false. That is, when the researcher has a certain degree of confidence, usually 95% to 99%, that the data does not support the null hypothesis.\n【5】 # An example\n【6】 For example, if we want to compare the test scores of two random samples of men and women, a null hypothesis would be that the mean score of the male population was the same as the mean score of the female population:\n【7】 where:\n【8】 Alternatively, the null hypothesis can postulate that the two samples are drawn from the same population, so that the variance and shape of the distributions are equal, as well as the means.\n【9】 Formulation of the null hypothesis is a vital step in testing statistical significance.  Having formulated such a hypothesis, one can establish the probability of observing the obtained data or data more different from the prediction of the null hypothesis, if the null hypothesis is true. That probability is what is commonly called the \"significance level\" of the results.\n【10】 That is, in scientific experimental design, we may predict that a particular factor will produce an effect on our dependent variable — this is our alternative hypothesis. We then consider how often we would expect to observe our experimental results, or results even more extreme, if we were to take many samples from a population where there was no effect (i.e. we test against our null hypothesis). If we find that this happens rarely (up to, say, 5% of the time), we can conclude that our results support our experimental prediction — we accept our alternative hypothesis.\n【11】 # Lack of directionality\n【12】 The null hypothesis does not have direction. That is, if we formulate a one-tailed alternative hypothesis that application of Drug A will lead to increased growth in patients, the null hypothesis remains that application of Drug A will have no effect on growth in patients. It is not merely the opposite of the alternative hypothesis — that is, it is not that application of Drug A will not lead to increased growth in patients.\n【13】 To explain why this should be so, it is instructive to consider the nature of the hypotheses outlined above. We are predicting that patients exposed to Drug A will see increased growth compared to a control group who do not receive the drug. That is,\n【14】 where:\n【15】 The null hypothesis is H0: μdrug = μcontrol\n【16】 It is not H0incorrect: μdrug <= μcontrol\n【17】 This is because, in order to gauge support for the alternative hypothesis, classical hypothesis testing requires us to calculate how often we would have obtained results as extreme as our experimental observations. In order to do this, we need to be able to model the sampling distribution characteristic of the null hypothesis. We are unable to create this model if it is imprecise: as Fisher, who first coined the term \"null hypothesis\" said, \"the null hypothesis must be exact, that is free of vagueness and ambiguity, because it must supply the basis of the 'problem of distribution,' of which the test of significance is the solution.\"\n【18】 Thus the null hypothesis must be numerically exact — it must state that a particular quantity or difference is equal to a particular number. In classical science, it is most typically the statement that there is no effect of a particular treatment; in observations, it is typically that there is no difference between the value of a particular measured variable and that of a prediction.\n【19】 (However, many statisticians believe that it is valid to state direction as a part of null hypothesis (for example see ). The logic is quite simple: if the direction is omitted, then if the null hypothesis is not rejected it is quite confusing to interpret the conclusion. Say, the null is that the population mean = 10, and the one-tailed alternative: mean > 10. If the sample evidence obtained through x-bar equals -200 and the corresponding t-test statistic equals -50, what is the conclusion? Not enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis? Surely not! But we cannot accept the one-sided alternative in this case. Therefore, to overcome this ambiguity, it is better to include the direction of the effect if the test is one-sided.)\n【20】 # Limitations\n【21】 A null hypothesis is only useful if it is possible to calculate the probability of observing a data set with particular parameters from it.  In general it is much harder to be precise about how probable the data would be if the alternative hypothesis were true.\n【22】 If experimental observations contradict the prediction of the null hypothesis, it means that either the null hypothesis is false, or the event under observation occurs very improbably. This gives us high confidence in the falsehood of the null hypothesis, which can be improved in proportion to the number of trials conducted. However, accepting the alternative hypothesis only commits us to a difference in observed parameters; it does not prove that the theory or principles that predicted such a difference is true, since it is always possible that the difference could be due to additional factors not recognized by the theory.\n【23】 For example, rejecting of a null hypothesis that predicts that the rates of symptom relief in a sample of patients who received a placebo and a sample who received a medicinal drug will be equal allows us to make a non-null statement (that the rates differed); it does not prove that the drug relieved the symptoms, though it gives us more confidence in that hypothesis.\n【24】 The formulation, testing, and rejection of null hypotheses is methodologically consistent with the falsifiability model of scientific discovery formulated by Karl Popper and widely believed to apply to most kinds of empirical research.  However, concerns regarding the high power of statistical tests to detect differences in large samples have led to suggestions for re-defining the null hypothesis, for example as a hypothesis that an effect falls within a range considered negligible.  This is an attempt to address the confusion among non-statisticians between significant and substantial, since large enough samples are likely to be able to indicate differences however minor.\n【25】 The theory underlying the idea of a null hypothesis is closely associated with the frequency theory of probability, in which probabilistic statements can only be made about the relative frequencies of events in arbitrarily large samples. A failure to reject the null hypothesis is meaningful only in relation to an arbitrarily large population from which the observed sample is supposed to be drawn.\n【26】 # Publication bias\n【27】 In 2002, a group of psychologists launched a new journal dedicated to experimental studies in psychology which support the null hypothesis.  The Journal of Articles in Support of the Null Hypothesis (JASNH) was founded to address a scientific publishing bias against such articles.   According to the editors,\n【28】 The \"File Drawer problem\" is a problem that exists due to the fact that academics tend not to publish results that indicate the null hypothesis could not be rejected. That is, they got a statistically significant result that indicated the relationship they were looking for did not exist. Even though these papers can often be interesting, they tend to end up unpublished, in \"file drawers.\"\n【29】 Ioannidis has inventoried factors that should alert readers to risks of publication bias .\n【30】 # Controversy\n【31】 Null hypothesis testing is controversial when the alternative hypothesis is suspected to be true at the outset of the experiment, making the null hypothesis the reverse of what the experimenter actually believes; it is put forward only to allow the data to contradict it.  Many statisticians have pointed out that rejecting the null hypothesis says nothing or very little about the likelihood that the null is true.  Under traditional null hypothesis testing, the null is rejected when P(Data | Null) (where P(x|y) denotes the probability of x given y) is very small, say 0.05. However, researchers are really interested in P(Null | Data) which cannot be inferred from a p-value. In some cases, P(Null | Data) approaches 1 while P(Data | Null) approaches 0, in other words, we can reject the null when it's virtually certain to be true. For this and other reasons, Gerd Gigerenzer has called null hypothesis testing \"mindless statistics\" while Jacob Cohen describes it as a ritual conducted to convince ourselves that we have the evidence needed to confirm our theories.\n【32】 Bayesian statisticians normally reject the idea of null hypothesis testing. Given a prior probability distribution for one or more parameters, sample evidence can be used to generate an updated posterior distribution. In this framework, but not in the null hypothesis testing framework, it is meaningful to make statements of the general form \"the probability that the true value of the parameter is greater than 0 is p\".", "title": "Null hypothesis", "tags": "", "lang": "", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"id\": \"9a4a6101204512b18dfb21b4f250c302c3702ceb\", \"overview\": \"None\", \"url\": \"https://www.wikidoc.org/index.php/Null-hypothesis\", \"source\": \"wikidoc\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-01-28 23:08:00", "update_time": "2024-02-18 22:23:10"}

This is typically associated with high-pressure, low-temperature minerals such as phengite, garnet, glaucophane within the lower blueschist facies. Such rocks are typically white, friable, and fibrous, and are known as\n【5】 whiteschist.\n【6】 Talc is a tri-octahedral layered mineral; its structure is similar to that of pyrophyllite, but with magnesium in the octahedral sites of the composite layers.\n【7】 # Occurrence\n【8】 Talc is a common metamorphic mineral in metamorphic belts which contain ultramafic rocks, such as soapstone (a high-talc rock), and within whiteschist and blueschist metamorphic terranes. Prime examples of whiteschists include the Franciscan Metamorphic Belt of the western United States, the western European Alps especially in Italy, certain areas of the Musgrave Block, and some collisional orogens such as the Himalayas which stretches along Pakistan, India, Nepal and Bhutan.\n【9】 Talc carbonate ultramafics are typical of many areas of the Archaean cratons, notably the komatiite belts of the Yilgarn Craton in Western Australia. Talc-carbonate ultramafics are also known from the Lachlan Fold Belt, eastern Australia, from Brazil, the Guiana Shield, and from the ophiolite belts of Turkey, Oman and the Middle East.\n【10】 Notable economic talc occurrences include the Mount Seabrook talc mine, Western Australia, formed upon a polydeformed, layered ultramafic intrusion. The France-based Luzenac Group is the world's largest supplier of mined talc; its largest talc mine at Trimouns near Luzenac in southern France produces 400,000 tonnes of talc per year, representing 8% of world production.\n【11】 # Uses\n【12】 Talc is used in many industries such as paper making, plastic, paint and coatings, rubber, food, electric cable, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, ceramics, etc. A coarse grayish-green high-talc rock is soapstone or steatite and has been used for stoves, sinks, electrical switchboards, crayons, soap, etc. It is often used for surfaces of lab counter tops and electrical switchboards because of its resistance to heat, electricity and acids. Talc finds use as a cosmetic (talcum powder), as a lubricant, and as a filler in paper manufacture. Talc is used in baby powder, an astringent powder used for preventing rashes on the area covered by a diaper. It is also often used in basketball to keep a player's hands dry. Most tailor's chalk, or French chalk, is talc, as is the chalk often used for welding or metalworking.\n【13】 Talc is also used as food additive or in pharmaceutical products as a glidant. In medicine talc is used as a pleurodesis agent to prevent recurrent pleural effusion or pneumothorax. In the European Union the additive number is E553b.\n【14】 Due to its low shear strength, talc is one of the oldest known solid lubricants. There is also a limited use of talc as friction-reducing additive in lubricating oils.\n【15】 Talc is widely used in the ceramics industry in both bodies and glazes. In low-fire artware bodies it imparts whiteness and increases thermal expansion to resist crazing. In stonewares, small percentages of talc are used to flux the body and therefore improve strength and vitrification. It is a source of MgO flux in high temperature glazes (to control melting temperature). It is also employed as a matting agent in earthenware glazes and can be used to produce magnesia mattes at high temperatures.\n【16】 ISO standard for quality (ISO 3262)\n【17】 Patents are pending on the use of magnesium silicate as a cement substitute. Its production requirements are less energy-intensive than ordinary Portland cement (at a heating requirement of around 650 °C for talc compared to 1500 °C for limestone to produce Portland cement), while it absorbs far more carbon dioxide as it hardens. This results in a negative carbon footprint overall, as the cement substitute removes 0.6 tonnes of CO2 per tonne used. This contrasts with a carbon footprint of 0.4 tonne per tonne of conventional cement.\n【18】 Talc is used in manufacturing of wall coatings as a base content Paints, Talc is also using in agriculture for organic farming Agriculture Talc is used in Food. Talc is also used in cosmetics baby powder. Talc is used in detergent powder.\n【19】 Talc is sometimes used as an adulterant to illegal heroin, to expand volume and weight and thereby increase its street value. With intravenous use, it may lead to talcosis, a granulomatous inflammation in the lungs.\n【20】 # Safety\n【21】 Talc powder is a household item, sold globally for use in personal hygiene and cosmetics. Some suspicions have been raised about the possibility its use promotes certain types of diseases, mainly cancers of the ovaries and lungs (it is in the same 2B category in the IARC listing as mobile phones and coffee) although this is not widely recognised as an established link.\n【22】 The studies reference, by subject: pulmonary issues, lung cancer, and ovarian cancer. One of these, published in 1993, was a US National Toxicology Program report, which found that cosmetic grade talc containing no asbestos-like fibres was correlated with tumour formation in rats (animal testing) forced to inhale talc for 6 hours a day, five days a week over at least 113 weeks. A 1971 paper found particles of talc embedded in 75% of the ovarian tumors studied.\n【23】 Recent research questions if a link does actually exist between the two.\n【24】 The Occupational Safety and Health Administration and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health have set occupational exposure limits to respirable talc dusts at 2 mg/m3 over an eight-hour workday.\n【25】 One particular issue with commercial use of talc is its frequent co-location in underground deposits with asbestos ore, which often leads to contamination of powdered talc products with asbestos fibres. Stringent quality control since 1976 (separating cosmetic and food-grade talc from \"industrial\" grade talc, which is allowed a certain portion of asbestos contamination) has mostly eliminated this issue, but it remains a continuing hazard requiring mitigation in the mining and processing of talc. A 2010 US FDA survey failed to find asbestos in a variety of talc-containing products.\n【26】 The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers talc (magnesium silicate) to be generally recognized as safe (GRAS) for use as an anti-caking agent in table salt in concentrations smaller than 2%.", "title": "Magnesium silicate", "tags": "", "lang": "", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"https://www.wikidoc.org/index.php/Magnesium_silicate\", \"id\": \"5cc942240c34da151f1a963418e374b7f4bc2d6d\", \"source\": \"wikidoc\", \"overview\": \"None\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-01-28 23:08:00", "update_time": "2024-02-18 19:26:42"}

This leads to activation of the JAK/STAT (Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription) and MAPK (mitogen activated protein kinase) cascades.\n【6】 # Expression\n【7】 LIF is normally expressed in the trophectoderm of the developing embryo, with its receptor LIFR expressed throughout the inner cell mass. As embryonic stem cells are derived from the inner cell mass at the blastocyst stage, removing them from the inner cell mass also removes their source of LIF. Recombinant LIF has been produced in plants by InVitria.\n【8】 # Use in stem cell culture\n【9】 LIF is often added to stem cell culture media as an alternative to feeder cell culture, due to the limitation that feeder cells present by only producing LIF on their cell surfaces. Feeder cells lacking the LIF gene do not effectively support stem cells. LIF promotes self-renewal by recruiting signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3). Stat3 is recruited to the activated LIF receptor and phosphorylated by Janus kinase. It bears noting that LIF and Stat3 are not sufficient to inhibit stem cell differentiation, as cells will differentiate upon removal of serum. During the reversibility phase of differentiation from naive pluripotency, it is possible to revert cells back to naive pluripotency through the addition of LIF.\n【10】 Removal of LIF pushes stem cells toward differentiation, however genetic manipulation of embryonic stem cells allows for LIF independent growth, notably overexpression of the gene Nanog.\n【11】 LIF is typically added to stem cell culture medium to reduce spontaneous differentiation.", "title": "Leukemia inhibitory factor", "tags": "", "lang": "", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"id\": \"2f79e645cb5f1b5b6d6656eef67f61323293e17c\", \"url\": \"https://www.wikidoc.org/index.php/LIF\", \"overview\": \"None\", \"source\": \"wikidoc\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-01-28 23:08:00", "update_time": "2024-02-18 22:30:31"}

It is located in New Delhi. It has been consistently ranked the top medical college in India by India Today. It is considered as the best public hospital in the country. It is also globally recognised for providing low-cost medical care to a large number of patients.\n【2】 # Academics\n【3】 The courses offered by the institute are:\n【4】 - MBBS\n【5】 - MD/MS\n【6】 - DM/MCh\n【7】 - BSc courses in Nursing, Paramedical and medical specialities\n【8】 - BSc (Honours) Human Biology (Till 2002)\n【9】 - MSc many specialities\n【10】 - MBiotech\n【11】 - PhD in many specialities\n【12】 ## Admission\n【13】 ### MBBS course\n【14】 Every year AIIMS accepts 45 students, of which 33 belong to General Category and 11 belong to the reserved category (SC/ST) and 1 orthopedic physically handicapped, based on the results of an all-India entrance examination for its MBBS program. The number of students who take the entrance exam every year varies from 70,000 to 80,000. Five international students (nominated by Government of India) complete the class size of 50.\n【15】 AIIMS also specializes in paramedical and basic science training.\n【16】 ### Post-graduate courses\n【17】 There are about 42 speciality post-graduate courses conducted at AIIMS. The entry is through a nationwide competitive examination held every six months. These courses are highly coveted by the medical graduates across the country because of the institution's excellent medical services, exposure to unusual & referred cases and excellent opportunities for research.\n【18】 ## Ranking\n【19】 AIIMS has been ranked repeatedly at the top in its field in annual surveys (starting in 1997) published by India Today. At present(2006-07), in the medical colleges and institution survey (MCIS) conducted by WHO, AIIMS ranked first in Asia. The hospital also earned the First Priority Hospitals (FPH) standard by Time Magazine. As per Forbes(Germany), most European nations recommend AIIMS for medical tourism in Asia. The hospital has been able to maintain high standards of quality while seeing large numbers of patients (3.5 million in 2006) at very low cost to patients, many of whom live in extreme poverty.\n【20】 ## Integrating clinics and research\n【21】 AIIMS was originally built as a SuperspecialityTemplate:Clarifyme tertiary care centre with primary emphasis on research and specialized training facilities. There are at least 45 superspecialitiesTemplate:Clarifyme at AIIMS. Having clinical superspecialitiesTemplate:Clarifyme in the same campus as its major research facilities makes AIIMS optimally suited for nurturing best quality translational researchTemplate:Clarifyme in India. However growing concern has been expressed that the quality of scholars inducted in AIIMS at postdoc and faculty levels has increasingly been deteriorating, mainly because of nepotism. Moreover, most medical students who train at AIIMS don't stay at AIIMS ( primarily because of lack of professional opportunities and more lucrative options abroad).\n【22】 # Medical services\n【23】 As per the AIIMS Citizen's Charter, doctors & staff at AIIMS strive to provide comprehensive, high quality tertiary care services including specialty and super-specialtyTemplate:Clarifyme services to all without consideration of caste, creed, religion, sex, economic status or disability. However, there may be some deficiencies due to extreme patient load and finite resources. Acquiring newer equipment for investigation, research and patient care is expedited as it is not constrained by funds. Despite the high volume of patients treated, mortality rates at AIIMS are comparable to some of the best medical institutions of the world.\n【24】 ## Speciality Centres at AIIMS\n【25】 There is a separate cardiothoracic and neurosciences centre (CNC) offering superspeciality level patient care, training and research in the respective fields.\n【26】 Dr. Rajendra Prasad Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences is a 300 bed ophthalmic (eyes) speciality centre devoted to the education, research and patient care. It is designated as the apex eye referral centre for India and is the WHO collaborating centre for ophthalmic programs.\n【27】 Recently Dr. BR Ambedkar Institute Rotary Cancer Hospital's construction has been completed. It specializes in medical, radiation and surgical oncology.\n【28】 Jai Prakash Narayan Apex Trauma Centre is the latest addition to the existing facilities. It is India's first full-fledged trauma centre to treat victims of trauma. It is located about 1 KM west from the main campus.\n【29】 # Residential facilities\n【30】 AIIMS is a residential university where the faculty members, staff and  students live on either the main campus or one of the several campuses which form a part of the Institution. There are five hostels for men undergraduate students and a single hostel available for women undergraduate students. These six hostels together can accommodate 850 students. For Post-graduate students, there are three hostels available for the men students and a single hostel for the women students. Additional hostels for Nursing students and Post-graduate students are available at a facility in the Masjid Moth area, situated near to the main AIIMS campus.\n【31】 Students of AIIMS involve themselves in extra-academic movements, including Pulse, the annual, inter-college festival hosted by AIIMS.\n【32】 # Achievements\n【33】 - AIIMS is the first Indian center to perform a successful cardiac transplant. The surgery was performed by Dr.P Venugopal, the current director of AIIMS in 1994.\n【34】 - AIIMS is a leader in Stem Cell transplant, especially Cardiac.\n【35】 - More than 80% of medical research from India in indexed journal comes from AIIMS. According to Forbes (USA), sixteen out of twenty top doctors are AIIMS alumni.\n【36】 - AIIMS is Asia's biggest hospital and top medical college\n【37】 # Controversies\n【38】 ## Institutional Quota\n【39】 Prior to Supreme court judgment of 25th Aug, 2001 and changes in institutional quota, AIIMS was criticised for the way 33% of Post Graduation Seats were reserved for those who complete their MBBS in AIIMS. This has been rectified and now admissions to the post-graduate courses at AIIMS are much sought after from medical graduates throughout the country. There is now a curtain on the controversy for the present, since the Supreme Court judgment has in effect clearly defined the administrative intricacies and application of rules.Template:Clarifyme\n【40】 The honourable Supreme Court of India, stated that reserving 33 per cent seats for institutional candidates was in effect 100 per cent reservation for subjects, which was declared ultra vires the Constitution, and, hence, was struck down. \n【41】 The quota has been quashed by the Supreme Court as per its Judgment in the year 2001.\n【42】 ## Caste Based Quota\n【43】 AIIMS students joined in the nation-wide protests which took place in May, 2006. During the strike all the medical services were shut but parallel OPDs were started after the strike had been carried out for a long time. The strike continued till 31 May when the doctors called off their strike after the Supreme Court of India orders.\n【44】 There is also a section of AIIMS students and doctors who have traditionally taken a pro-reservation stance on the basis of social justice.\n【45】 This was not the first time that the apolitical Students Union of AIIMS has stood up to the ruling powers. The students union was banned during the Emergency (1977) and its President (Dr Yaten Kumar aka YK) discharged honourably from the Institute. During the Emergency, AIIMS Students Union was the first organisation in the country to go on strike.\n【46】 ## 2006 Controversy over AIIMS' autonomy\n【47】 AIIMS doctors again went on a flash strike in June-July 2006 over the issue of increasing political interference in the institution by the Union Health Minister Anbumani Ramadoss. The doctors decided to go on strike following the controversial sacking of P. Venugopal, the former director of AIIMS. Venugopal challenged his sacking in the court of law, and the strike ended following the Delhi High Court's decision staying Venugopal's sacking on July 7, 2006. However, Ramadoss filed an appeal in the Supreme Court of India against the stay on the removal of AIIMS Director on the same day. On July 25, the government offered to withdraw its order sacking Venugopal but would raise charges against him before a single-bench court.\n【48】 During this controversy some patients of AIIMS died due to lack of treatment.\n【49】 # Notable faculty and Alumni\n【50】 - Professor P. Venugopal (Current Director)\n【51】 Apart from being one of the longest-serving doctors at the institute, he is also credited with being the first Indian to perform a heart transplant.\n【52】 - Professor J.N.

There is a Black Box Warning for this drug as shown here.  Common adverse reactions include erosive gastritis, dyspepsia, gastritis, diarrhea, gastric ulcer, upper abdominal pain, and nausea.\n【6】 # Adult Indications and Dosage\n【7】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Adult)\n【8】 - Dosing Information\n【9】 - The dosage is one tablet twice daily of VIMOVO 375 mg naproxen and 20 mg of esomeprazole or 500 mg naproxen and 20 mg of esomeprazole.\n【10】 - Dosing Information\n【11】 - The dosage is one tablet twice daily of VIMOVO 375 mg naproxen and 20 mg of esomeprazole or 500 mg naproxen and 20 mg of esomeprazole.\n【12】 - Dosing Information\n【13】 - The dosage is one tablet twice daily of VIMOVO 375 mg naproxen and 20 mg of esomeprazole or 500 mg naproxen and 20 mg of esomeprazole.\n【14】 ## Off-Label Use and Dosage (Adult)\n【15】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\n【16】 There is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium in adult patients.\n【17】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n【18】 There is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium in adult patients.\n【19】 # Pediatric Indications and Dosage\n【20】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Pediatric)\n【21】 There is limited information regarding FDA-Labeled Use of Naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium in pediatric patients.\n【22】 ## Off-Label Use and Dosage (Pediatric)\n【23】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\n【24】 There is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium in pediatric patients.\n【25】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n【26】 There is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium in pediatric patients.\n【27】 # Contraindications\n【28】 - VIMOVO is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to naproxen, esomeprazole magnesium, substituted benzimidazoles, or to any of the excipients.\n【29】 - VIMOVO is contraindicated in patients who have experienced asthma, urticaria, or allergic-type reactions after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs. Severe, rarely fatal, anaphylactic-like reactions to NSAIDs have been reported in such patients. Hypersensitivity reactions, e.g., angioedema and anaphylactic reaction/shock, have been reported with esomeprazole use.\n【30】 - VIMOVO is contraindicated for the treatment of peri-operative pain in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.\n【31】 # Warnings\n【32】 ### Precautions\n【33】 - Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events\n【34】 - Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, myocardial infarction, and stroke, which can be fatal. All NSAIDS, both COX-2 selective and nonselective, may have a similar risk. Patients with known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease may be at greater risk. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the signs and/or symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.\n【35】 - There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use.\n【36】 - Two large, controlled, clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10–14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke.\n【37】 - Hypertension\n【38】 - NSAIDs, including naproxen, a component of VIMOVO, can lead to onset of new hypertension or worsening of pre-existing hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking thiazides or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs. NSAIDs should be used with caution in patients with hypertension. Blood pressure (BP) should be monitored closely during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy.\n【39】 - Congestive Heart Failure and Edema\n【40】 - Fluid retention, edema, and peripheral edema have been observed in some patients taking NSAIDs and should be used with caution in patients with fluid retention or heart failure.\n【41】 - Gastrointestinal Effects — Risk of Ulceration, Bleeding, and Perforation\n【42】 - NSAIDs, including naproxen, a component of VIMOVO, can cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. While VIMOVO has been shown to significantly decrease the occurrence of gastric ulcers compared to naproxen alone, ulceration and associated complications can still occur.\n【43】 - These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occur in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3–6 months, and in about 2–4% of patients treated for one year. These trends continue with longer duration of use, increasing the likelihood of developing a serious GI event at some time during the course of therapy. However, even short-term therapy is not without risk. The utility of periodic laboratory monitoring has not been demonstrated, nor has it been adequately assessed.\n【44】 - VIMOVO should be prescribed with caution in those with a prior history of ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or gastrointestinal bleeding who use NSAIDs have a greater than 10-fold increased risk of developing a GI bleed compared to patients with neither of these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk for GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids or anticoagulants or antiplatelets (including low-dose aspirin), longer duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status. Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in elderly or debilitated patients, and therefore special care should be taken in treating this population.\n【45】 - To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event in patients treated with an NSAID or NSAID-containing product, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration. Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI adverse event is suspected. This should include discontinuation of the NSAID until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. For high risk patients, alternate therapies that do not involve NSAIDs should be considered.\n【46】 - Epidemiological studies of the case-control and cohort design have demonstrated an association between use of psychotropic drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. In two studies, concurrent use of an NSAID, COX-2 inhibitor, or aspirin potentiated the risk of bleeding. Although these studies focused on upper gastrointestinal bleeding, bleeding at other sites cannot be ruled out.\n【47】 - NSAIDs should be given with care to patients with a history of inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease) as their condition may be exacerbated.\n【48】 - Gastrointestinal symptomatic response to therapy with VIMOVO does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy.\n【49】 - Atrophic gastritis has been noted occasionally in gastric corpus biopsies from patients treated long-term with omeprazole, of which esomeprazole is an enantiomer and a component of VIMOVO.\n【50】 - Active Bleeding\n【51】 - When active and clinically significant bleeding from any source occurs in patients receiving VIMOVO, the treatment should be withdrawn.\n【52】 - Renal Effects\n【53】 - Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, salt depletion, those taking diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin II receptor antagonists and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.\n【54】 - Advanced Renal Disease\n【55】 - No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of VIMOVO in patients with advanced renal disease. Therefore, treatment with VIMOVO is not recommended in these patients with advanced renal disease. If VIMOVO therapy must be initiated, close monitoring of the patient's renal function is advisable.\n【56】 - Anaphylactic Reactions\n【57】 - Anaphylactic reactions may occur in patients without known prior exposure to either component of VIMOVO. NSAIDs should not be given to patients with the aspirin triad. This symptom complex typically occurs in asthmatic patients who experience rhinitis with or without nasal polyps, or who exhibit severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs. Emergency help should be sought in cases where an anaphylactic reaction occurs. Anaphylactic reactions, like anaphylaxis, may have a fatal outcome.\n【58】 - Skin Reactions\n【59】 - NSAIDs can cause serious skin adverse events such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis, which can be fatal. These serious events may occur without warning. Patients should be informed about the signs and symptoms of serious skin manifestations and use of the drug should be discontinued at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity.\n【60】 - Fetal Toxicity\n【61】 - Starting at 30 weeks gestation, VIMOVO, as with other NSAID-containing products, should be avoided because it may cause premature closure of the ductus arteriosus.\n【62】 - Hepatic Effects\n【63】 - Borderline elevations of one or more liver tests may occur in up to 15% of patients taking NSAIDs including naproxen, a component of VIMOVO. Hepatic abnormalities may be the result of hypersensitivity rather than direct toxicity. These laboratory abnormalities may progress, may remain essentially unchanged, or may be transient with continued therapy. The SGPT (ALT) test is probably the most sensitive indicator of liver dysfunction. Notable elevations of ALT or AST (approximately three or more times the upper limit of normal) have been reported in approximately 1% of patients in clinical trials with NSAIDs. In addition, rare cases of severe hepatic reactions, including jaundice and fatal fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis and hepatic failure, some of them with fatal outcomes, have been reported.\n【64】 - A patient with symptoms and/or signs suggesting liver dysfunction, or in whom an abnormal liver test has occurred, should be evaluated for evidence of the development of more severe hepatic reaction while on therapy with VIMOVO.\n【65】 - If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), VIMOVO should be discontinued.\n【66】 - Chronic alcoholic liver disease and probably other diseases with decreased or abnormal plasma proteins (albumin) reduce the total plasma concentration of naproxen, but the plasma concentration of unbound naproxen is increased. Caution is advised when high doses are required and some adjustment of dosage may be required in these patients. It is prudent to use the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible duration of adequate treatment.\n【67】 - VIMOVO should be avoided in patients with severe hepatic impairment.\n【68】 - Hematological Effects\n【69】 - Anemia is sometimes seen in patients receiving NSAIDs. This may be due to fluid retention, occult or gross GI blood loss, or an incompletely described effect upon erythropoiesis. Patients on long-term treatment with NSAIDs should have their hemoglobin or hematocrit checked if they exhibit any signs or symptoms of anemia.\n【70】 - NSAIDs inhibit platelet aggregation and have been shown to prolong bleeding time in some patients. Unlike aspirin, their effect on platelet function is quantitatively less, of shorter duration, and reversible. Patients receiving VIMOVO who may be adversely affected by alterations in platelet function, such as those with coagulation disorders or patients receiving anticoagulants or antiplatelets, should be carefully monitored.\n【71】 - Pre-existing Asthma\n【72】 - Patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma. The use of aspirin in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma has been associated with severe bronchospasm, which can be fatal. Since cross reactivity, including bronchospasm, between aspirin and other NSAIDs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, VIMOVO should not be administered to patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity and should be used with caution in patients with pre-existing asthma.\n【73】 - Concomitant NSAID Use\n【74】 - VIMOVO contains naproxen as one of its active ingredients. It should not be used with other naproxen-containing products since they all circulate in the plasma as the naproxen anion.\n【75】 - The concomitant use of VIMOVO with any dose of a non-aspirin NSAID should be avoided due to the potential for increased risk of adverse reactions.\n【76】 - Corticosteroid Treatment\n【77】 - VIMOVO cannot be expected to substitute for corticosteroids or to treat corticosteroid insufficiency. Abrupt discontinuation of corticosteroids may lead to disease exacerbation. Patients on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should have their therapy tapered slowly if a decision is made to discontinue corticosteroids and the patient should be observed closely for any evidence of adverse effects, including adrenal insufficiency and exacerbation of symptoms of arthritis.\n【78】 - Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea\n【79】 - Published observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy like VIMOVO may be associated with an increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea, especially in hospitalized patients. This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve.\n【80】 - Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated.\n【81】 - Interaction with Clopidogrel\n【82】 - Avoid concomitant use of esomeprazole with clopidogrel. Clopidogrel is a prodrug. Inhibition of platelet aggregation by clopidogrel is entirely due to an active metabolite. The metabolism of clopidogrel to its active metabolite can be impaired by use with concomitant medications, such as esomeprazole, that inhibit CYP2C19 activity. Concomitant use of clopidogrel with 40 mg esomeprazole reduces the pharmacological activity of clopidogrel. When using esomeprazole, a component of VIMOVO, consider alternative anti-platelet therapy.\n【83】 - Bone Fracture\n【84】 - Several published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. The risk of fracture was increased in patients who received high-dose, defined as multiple daily doses, and long-term PPI therapy (a year or longer). Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures should be managed according to the established treatment guidelines.\n【85】 - VIMOVO (a combination PPI/NSAID) is approved for use twice a day and does not allow for administration of a lower daily dose of the PPI.\n【86】 - Masking of Inflammation and Fever\n【87】 - The pharmacological activity of VIMOVO in reducing fever and inflammation may diminish the utility of these diagnostic signs in detecting complications of presumed noninfectious, noninflammatory painful conditions.\n【88】 - Laboratory Tests\n【89】 - Because serious GI tract ulcerations and bleeding can occur without warning symptoms, physicians should monitor for signs or symptoms of GI bleeding. Patients on long-term treatment with NSAIDs should have their CBC and a chemistry profile checked periodically. If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver or renal disease develop, systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.) or if abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, VIMOVO should be discontinued.\n【90】 - Patients with initial hemoglobin values of 10 g or less who are to receive long-term therapy should have hemoglobin values determined periodically.\n【91】 - Serum chromogranin A (CgA) levels increase secondary to drug-induced decreases in gastric acidity. The increased CgA level may cause false positive results in diagnostic investigations for neuroendocrine tumors. Providers should temporarily stop esomeprazole treatment at least 14 days before assessing CgA levels and consider repeating the test if initial CgA levels are high. If serial tests are performed (e.g. for monitoring), the same commercial laboratory should be used for testing, as reference ranges between tests may vary.\n【92】 - Hypomagnesemia\n【93】 - Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least three months, in most cases after a year of therapy. Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures. In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI.\n【94】 - For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals may consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of PPI treatment and periodically.\n【95】 - Concomitant use of St John's Wort or Rifampin with VIMOVO\n【96】 - Drugs that induce CYP2C19 or CYP3A4 (such as St John's Wort or rifampin) can substantially decrease esomeprazole concentrations. Avoid concomitant use of VIMOVO with St John's Wort or rifampin.\n【97】 - Concomitant use of VIMOVO with Methotrexate\n【98】 - Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. In high-dose methotrexate administration a temporary withdrawal of the PPI may be considered in some patients.\n【99】 # Adverse Reactions\n【100】 ## Clinical Trials Experience\n【101】 - Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.\n【102】 - The adverse reactions reported below are specific to the clinical trials with VIMOVO. See also the full prescribing information for naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium products.\n【103】 - The safety of VIMOVO was evaluated in clinical studies involving 2317 patients (aged 27 to 90 years) and ranging from 3-12 months. Patients received either 500 mg/20 mg of VIMOVO twice daily (n=1157), 500 mg of enteric-coated naproxen twice daily (n=426), or placebo (n=246). The average number of VIMOVO doses taken over 12 months was 696±44.\n【104】 - The table below lists all adverse reactions, regardless of causality, occurring in >2% of patients receiving VIMOVO from two clinical studies (Study 1 and Study 2). Both of these studies were randomized, multi-center, double-blind, parallel studies. The majority of patients were female (67%), white (86%). The majority of patients were 50-69 years of age (83%). Approximately one quarter were on low-dose aspirin.\n【105】 - In Study 1 and Study 2, patients taking VIMOVO had fewer premature discontinuations due to adverse reactions compared to patients taking enteric-coated naproxen alone (7.9% vs. 12.5% respectively). The most common reasons for discontinuations due to adverse events in the VIMOVO treatment group were upper abdominal pain (1.2%, n=5), duodenal ulcer (0.7%, n=3) and erosive gastritis (0.7%, n=3). Among patients receiving enteric-coated naproxen, the most common reasons for discontinuations due to adverse events were duodenal ulcer 5.4% (n=23), dyspepsia 2.8% (n=12) and upper abdominal pain 1.2% (n=5). The proportion of patients discontinuing treatment due to any upper gastrointestinal adverse events (including duodenal ulcers) in patients treated with VIMOVO was 4% compared to 12% for patients taking enteric-coated naproxen.\n【106】 - The table below lists all adverse reactions, regardless of causality, occurring in >2% of patients from 2 clinical studies conducted in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee (Study 3 and Study 4).\n【107】 - The percentage of subjects who withdrew from the VIMOVO treatment group in these studies due to treatment-emergent adverse events was 7%. There were no preferred terms in which more than 1% of subjects withdrew from any treatment group.\n【108】 - The long-term safety of VIMOVO was evaluated in an open-label clinical trial of 239 patients, of which 135 patients received 500 mg/20 mg of VIMOVO for 12 months. There were no differences in frequency or types of adverse reactions seen in the long-term safety study compared to shorter-term treatment in the randomized controlled studies.\n【109】 ## Postmarketing Experience\n【110】 - The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of naproxen. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These reports are listed below by body system:\n【111】 Anaphylactic reactions, angioneurotic edema, menstrual disorders, pyrexia (chills and fever)\n【112】 Congestive heart failure, vasculitis, hypertension, pulmonary edema\n【113】 Gastrointestinal bleeding and/or perforation, hematemesis, pancreatitis, vomiting, colitis, exacerbation of inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease), nonpeptic gastrointestinal ulceration, ulcerative stomatitis, esophagitis, peptic ulceration\n【114】 Jaundice, abnormal liver function tests, hepatitis (some cases have been fatal)\n【115】 Eosinophilia, leukopenia, melena, thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis, granulocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia\n【116】 Hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia\n【117】 Inability to concentrate, depression, dream abnormalities, insomnia, malaise, myalgia, muscle weakness, aseptic meningitis, cognitive dysfunction, convulsions\n【118】 Eosinophilic pneumonitis, asthma\n【119】 Alopecia, urticaria, skin rashes, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, erythema nodosum, fixed drug eruption, lichen planus, pustular reaction, systemic lupus erythematoses, bullous reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, photosensitive dermatitis, photosensitivity reactions, including rare cases resembling porphyria cutanea tarda (pseudoporphyria) or epidermolysis bullosa. If skin fragility, blistering or other symptoms suggestive of pseudoporphyria occur, treatment should be discontinued and the patient monitored.\n【120】 Hearing impairment, corneal opacity, papillitis, retrobulbar optic neuritis, papilledema\n【121】 Glomerular nephritis, hematuria, hyperkalemia, interstitial nephritis, nephrotic syndrome, renal disease, renal failure, renal papillary necrosis, raised serum creatinine\n【122】 Infertility\n【123】 - The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of esomeprazole. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These reports are listed below by body system:\n【124】 Agranulocytosis, pancytopenia\n【125】 Blurred vision\n【126】 Pancreatitis; stomatitis; microscopic colitis\n【127】 Hepatic failure, hepatitis with or without jaundice\n【128】 Anaphylactic reaction/shock\n【129】 GI candidiasis, Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea\n【130】 Hypomagnesemia\n【131】 Muscular weakness, myalgia, bone fracture\n【132】 Hepatic encephalopathy, taste disturbance\n【133】 Aggression, agitation, depression, hallucination\n【134】 Interstitial nephritis\n【135】 Gynecomastia\n【136】 Bronchospasm\n【137】 Alopecia, erythema multiforme, hyperhidrosis, photosensitivity, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis (some fatal)\n【138】 # Drug Interactions\n【139】 - ACE-inhibitors/Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists\n【140】 - Reports suggest that NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists. NSAIDs may also increase the risk of renal impairment associated with the use of ACE-inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor antagonists. Monitor renal function closely in patients taking VIMOVO concomitantly with ACE-inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor antagonists who are elderly, volume-depleted, or with impaired renal function.\n【141】 - Aspirin\n【142】 - VIMOVO can be administered with low-dose aspirin (≤325 mg/day) therapy. The concurrent use of aspirin and VIMOVO may increase the risk of serious adverse events.\n【143】 - When naproxen is administered with doses of aspirin (>1 gram/day), its protein binding is reduced. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known. However, as with other NSAIDs, concomitant administration of naproxen and aspirin is not generally recommended because of the potential of increased adverse effects.\n【144】 - Cholestyramine\n【145】 - As with other NSAIDs, concomitant administration of cholestyramine can delay the absorption of naproxen.\n【146】 - Cyclosporin\n【147】 - As with all NSAIDs caution is advised when cyclosporin is co-administered because of the increased risk of nephrotoxicity.\n【148】 - Tacrolimus\n【149】 - Concomitant administration of esomeprazole, a component of VIMOVO, and tacrolimus may increase the serum levels of tacrolimus.\n【150】 - Diuretics\n【151】 - Clinical studies, as well as postmarketing observations, have shown that NSAIDs can reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazides in some patients. This response has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. During concomitant therapy with NSAIDs, the patient should be observed closely both for signs of renal failure, as well as to monitor to assure diuretic efficacy.\n【152】 - Lithium\n【153】 - NSAIDs have produced an elevation of plasma lithium levels and a reduction in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15% and the renal clearance was decreased by approximately 20%. These effects have been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by the NSAID. Thus, when NSAIDs and lithium are administered concurrently, subjects should be observed carefully for signs of lithium toxicity.\n【154】 - Methotrexate\n【155】 - NSAIDs have been reported to competitively inhibit methotrexate accumulation in rabbit kidney slices. NSAIDs have been reported to reduce the tubular secretion of methotrexate in an animal model. This may indicate that they could enhance the toxicity of methotrexate. Caution should be used when NSAIDs are administered concomitantly with methotrexate.\n【156】 - Case reports, published population pharmacokinetic studies, and retrospective analyses suggest that concomitant administration of PPIs and methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite hydroxymethotrexate. However, no formal drug interaction studies of methotrexate with PPIs have been conducted.\n【157】 - Anticoagulants\n【158】 - Naproxen decreases platelet aggregation and may prolong bleeding time. In addition, because warfarin and NSAIDs are highly protein bound, the free fraction of warfarin and naproxen may increase substantially in some patients.\n【159】 - Concomitant use of VIMOVO and anticoagulants (such as warfarin, dicumarol and heparin) may result in increased risk of bleeding complications.\n【160】 - The effects of warfarin and NSAIDs on GI bleeding are synergistic, such that users of both drugs together have a risk of serious GI bleeding higher than users of either drug alone.\n【161】 - Post-marketing reports of changes in prothrombin measures have been reported among patients on concomitant warfarin and esomeprazole therapy. Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death. Patients treated with proton pump inhibitors and warfarin concomitantly may need to be monitored for increases in INR and prothrombin time.\n【162】 - Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)\n【163】 - There is an increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding when selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are combined with NSAIDs including COX-2 selective inhibitors. Caution should be used when NSAIDs are administered concomitantly with SSRIs.\n【164】 - Other Information Concerning Drug Interactions\n【165】 - Naproxen is highly bound to plasma albumin; it thus has a theoretical potential for interaction with other albumin-bound drugs such as sulphonylureas, hydantoins, and other NSAIDs. Patients simultaneously receiving VIMOVO and a hydantoin, sulphonamide or sulphonylurea should be observed for adjustment of dose if required.\n【166】 - Naproxen and other NSAIDs can reduce the antihypertensive effect of propranolol and other beta-blockers.\n【167】 - Probenecid given concurrently increases naproxen anion plasma levels and extends its plasma half-life significantly.\n【168】 - Interactions With Investigations of Neuroendocrine Tumors\n【169】 - Drug-induced decrease in gastric acidity results in enterochromaffin-like cell hyperplasia and increased Chromogranin A levels which may interfere with investigations for neuroendocrine tumors.\n【170】 - Drug/Laboratory Test Interaction\n【171】 - Naproxen may decrease platelet aggregation and prolong bleeding time. This effect should be kept in mind when bleeding times are determined.\n【172】 - The administration of naproxen may result in increased urinary values for 17-ketogenic steroids because of an interaction between the drug and/or its metabolites with m-di-nitrobenzene used in this assay. Although 17-hydroxy-corticosteroid measurements (Porter-Silber test) do not appear to be artifactually altered, it is suggested that therapy with naproxen be temporarily discontinued 72 hours before adrenal function tests are performed if the Porter-Silber test is to be used.\n【173】 - Naproxen may interfere with some urinary assays of 5-hydroxy indoleacetic acid (5HIAA).\n【174】 - Interactions Related to Absorption\n【175】 - Esomeprazole inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, esomeprazole may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability. Like with other drugs that decrease the intragastric acidity, the absorption of drugs such as ketoconazole, iron salts and erlotinib can decrease, while the absorption of drugs such as digoxin can increase during treatment with esomeprazole. Concomitant treatment with omeprazole (20 mg daily) and digoxin in healthy subjects increased the bioavailability of digoxin by 10% (30% in two subjects). Esomeprazole is an enantiomer of omeprazole. Coadministration of digoxin with esomeprazole is expected to increase the systemic exposure of digoxin. Therefore, patients may need to be monitored for increases in digoxin toxicity when digoxin is taken concomitantly with esomeprazole.\n【176】 - Antiretroviral Agents\n【177】 - Concomitant use of atazanavir and nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors such as esomeprazole is not recommended. Co-administration of atazanavir with proton pump inhibitors is expected to substantially decrease atazanavir plasma concentrations and thereby reduce its therapeutic effect.\n【178】 - Omeprazole, the racemate of esomeprazole, has been reported to interact with some antiretroviral drugs. The clinical importance and the mechanisms behind these interactions are not always known. Increased gastric pH during omeprazole treatment may change the absorption of the antiretroviral drug. Other possible interaction mechanisms are via CYP2C19. For some antiretroviral drugs, such as atazanavir and nelfinavir, decreased serum levels have been reported when given together with omeprazole. Following multiple doses of nelfinavir (1250 mg, twice daily) and omeprazole (40 mg once a day), AUC was decreased by 36% and 92%, Cmax by 37% and 89% and Cmin by 39% and 75% respectively for nelfinavir and main oxidative metabolite, hydroxy-t-butylamide (M8). Following multiple doses of atazanavir (400 mg, once a day) and omeprazole (40 mg, once a day, 2 hr before atazanavir), AUC was decreased by 94%, Cmax by 96%, and Cmin by 95%. Concomitant administration with omeprazole and drugs such as atazanavir and nelfinavir is therefore not recommended. For other antiretroviral drugs, such as saquinavir, elevated serum levels have been reported with an increase in AUC by 82% in Cmax by 75% and in Cmin by 106% following multiple dosing of saquinavir/ritonavir (1000/100 mg) twice a day for 15 days with omeprazole 40 mg once a day co-administered on days 11 to 15. Therefore, clinical and laboratory monitoring for saquinavir toxicity is recommended during concurrent use with esomeprazole. Dose reduction of saquinavir should be considered from the safety perspective for individual patients. There are also some antiretroviral drugs of which unchanged serum levels have been reported when given with omeprazole.\n【179】 - Effects on Hepatic Metabolism/Cytochrome P-450 pathways\n【180】 - Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4.\n【181】 - In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that esomeprazole is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that esomeprazole does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin.\n【182】 - However, post-marketing reports of changes in prothrombin measures have been received among patients on concomitant warfarin and esomeprazole therapy. Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death. Patients treated with proton pump inhibitors and warfarin concomitantly may need to be monitored for increases in INR and prothrombin time.\n【183】 - Esomeprazole may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major esomeprazole metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of esomeprazole 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate, resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam.\n【184】 - Clopidogrel is metabolized to its active metabolite in part by CYP2C19. Concomitant use of esomeprazole 40 mg results in reduced plasma concentrations of the active metabolite of clopidogrel and a reduction in platelet inhibition. Avoid concomitant administration of esomeprazole with clopidogrel. When using esomeprazole, a component of VIMOVO, consider use of alternative anti-platelet therapy.\n【185】 - Concomitant administration of esomeprazole and a combined inhibitor of CYP2C19 and CYP3A4, such as voriconazole, may result in more than doubling of the esomeprazole exposure. Dose adjustment of esomeprazole is not normally required. Omeprazole acts as an inhibitor of CYP2C19. Omeprazole, given in doses of 40 mg daily for one week to 20 healthy subjects in cross-over study, increased Cmax and AUC of cilostazol by 18% and 26% respectively. Cmax and AUC of one of its active metabolites, 3,4-dihydrocilostazol, which has 4-7 times the activity of cilostazol, were increased by 29% and 69% respectively. Co-administration of cilostazol with esomeprazole is expected to increase concentrations of cilostazol and its above mentioned active metabolite. Therefore a dose reduction of cilostazol from 100 mg twice daily to 50 mg twice daily should be considered.\n【186】 - Drugs known to induce CYP2C19 or CYP3A4 (such as rifampin) may lead to decreased esomeprazole serum levels. Omeprazole, of which esomeprazole is an enantiomer, has been reported to interact with St. John's Wort, an inducer of CYP3A4. In a cross-over study in 12 healthy male subjects, St John's Wort (300 mg three times daily for 14 days) significantly decreased the systemic exposure of omeprazole in CYP2C19 poor metabolizers (Cmax and AUC decreased by 37.5% and 37.9%, respectively) and extensive metabolizers (Cmax and AUC decreased by 49.6% and 43.9%, respectively). Avoid concomitant use of St. John's Wort or rifampin with VIMOVO.\n【187】 - Other Pharmacokinetic-based Interactions\n【188】 - Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine does not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of esomeprazole.\n【189】 # Use in Specific Populations\n【190】 ### Pregnancy\n【191】 Pregnancy Category (FDA):\n【192】 - Pregnancy Category  C prior to 30 weeks gestation; Category D starting 30 weeks gestation\n【193】 - Risk Summary\n【194】 - There are no adequate and well-controlled studies with VIMOVO in pregnant women. VIMOVO contains naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium. Esomeprazole is the S-isomer of omeprazole. Available epidemiologic data fail to demonstrate an increased risk of major congenital malformations or other adverse pregnancy outcomes with first trimester omeprazole use. However, starting at 30 weeks gestation VIMOVO, as with other NSAID-containing products, should be avoided because NSAIDs can cause premature closure of the ductus arteriosus. Animal reproduction studies with naproxen conducted in rats and rabbits at 0.23 and 0.27 times the human systemic exposure showed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus. Teratogenicity was not observed in animal reproduction studies with esomeprazole magnesium at doses about 57 times and 35 times a human dose of 40 mg (based on body surface area) in rats and rabbits, respectively. However, changes in bone morphology and physeal dysplasia were observed in offspring of rats dosed through most of pregnancy and lactation at doses equal to or greater than approximately 33.6 times an oral human dose of 40 mg (see Animal Data). Because of the observed effect at high doses of esomeprazole magnesium on developing bone in rat studies, Vimovo should be used prior to 30 weeks gestation only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Starting at 30 weeks gestation, if this drug is used, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.\n【195】 - Clinical Considerations\n【196】 - Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions\n【197】 - There is some evidence to suggest that when inhibitors of prostaglandin synthesis, such as an NSAID, naproxen, a component of VIMOVO, are used to delay preterm labor there is an increased risk of neonatal complications such as necrotizing enterocolitis, patent ductus arteriosus and intracranial hemorrhage. Naproxen treatment given in late pregnancy to delay parturition has been associated with persistent pulmonary hypertension, renal dysfunction and abnormal prostaglandin E levels in preterm infants.\n【198】 Pregnancy Category (AUS):\n【199】 - Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) Pregnancy Category\n【200】 There is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium in women who are pregnant.\n【201】 ### Labor and Delivery\n【202】 - Naproxen-containing products are not recommended in labor and delivery because, through its prostaglandin synthesis inhibitory effect, naproxen may adversely affect fetal circulation and inhibit uterine contractions, thus increasing the risk of uterine hemorrhage. In rat studies with NSAIDs, as with other drugs known to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, an increased incidence of dystocia, delayed parturition, and decreased pup survival occurred.\n【203】 - Human Data\n【204】 - Esomeprazole is the S-isomer of omeprazole. Four epidemiological studies compared the frequency of congenital abnormalities among infants born to women who used omeprazole during pregnancy with the frequency of abnormalities among infants of women exposed to H2-receptor antagonists or other controls.\n【205】 - A population-based retrospective cohort epidemiological study from the Swedish Medical Birth Registry, covering approximately 99% of pregnancies, from 1995-99, reported on 955 infants (824 exposed during the first trimester with 39 of these exposed beyond first trimester, and 131 exposed after the first trimester) whose mothers used omeprazole during pregnancy. The number of infants exposed in utero to omeprazole that had any malformation, low birth weight, low Apgar score, or hospitalization was similar to the number observed in this population. The number of infants born with ventricular septal defects and the number of stillborn infants was slightly higher in the omeprazole-exposed infants than the expected number in this population.\n【206】 - A population-based retrospective cohort study covering all live births in Denmark from 1996-2009, reported on 1,800 live births whose mothers used omeprazole during the first trimester of pregnancy and 837, 317 live births whose mothers did not use any proton pump inhibitor. The overall rate of birth defects in infants born to mothers with first trimester exposure to omeprazole was 2.9% and 2.6% in infants born to mothers not exposed to any proton pump inhibitor during the first trimester.\n【207】 - A retrospective cohort study reported on 689 pregnant women exposed to either H2-blockers or omeprazole in the first trimester (134 exposed to omeprazole) and 1,572 pregnant women unexposed to either during the first trimester. The overall malformation rate in offspring born to mothers with first trimester exposure to omeprazole, an H2-blocker, or were unexposed was 3.6%, 5.5%, and 4.1% respectively.\n【208】 - A small prospective observational cohort study followed 113 women exposed to omeprazole during pregnancy (89% first trimester exposures). The reported rate of major congenital malformations was 4% in the omeprazole group, 2% in controls exposed to non-teratogens, and 2.8% in disease-paired controls. Rates of spontaneous and elective abortions, preterm deliveries, gestational age at delivery, and mean birth weight were similar among the groups.\n【209】 - Several studies have reported no apparent adverse short-term effects on the infant when single dose oral or intravenous omeprazole was administered to over 200 pregnant women as premedication for cesarean section under general anesthesia.\n【210】 - Animal Data\n【211】 - There are no reproduction studies in animals with VIMOVO. Reproduction studies with naproxen have been performed in rats at 20 mg/kg/day (125 mg/m2/day, 0.23 times the human systemic exposure), rabbits at 20 mg/kg/day (220 mg/m2/day, 0.27 times the human systemic exposure), and mice at 170 mg/kg/day (510 mg/m2/day, 0.28 times the human systemic exposure) with no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to the drug. Reproduction studies have been performed with esomeprazole magnesium in rats at oral doses up to 280 mg/kg/day (about 57 times an oral human dose of 40 mg on a body surface area basis) and in rabbits at oral doses up to 86 mg/kg/day (about 35 times an oral human dose of 40 mg on a body surface area basis) and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to esomeprazole magnesium.\n【212】 - A pre- and postnatal developmental toxicity study in rats with additional endpoints to evaluate bone development were performed with esomeprazole magnesium at oral doses of 14 to 280 mg/kg/day (about 3.4 to 57 times a daily human dose of 40 mg on a body surface area basis). Neonatal/early postnatal (birth to weaning) survival was decreased at doses equal to or greater than 138 mg/kg/day (about 33 times an oral human dose of 40 mg on a body surface area basis). Body weight and body weight gain were reduced and neurobehavioral or general developmental delays in the immediate post-weaning timeframe were evident at doses equal to or greater than 69 mg /kg/day (about 16.8 times an oral human dose of 40 mg on a body surface area basis). In addition, decreased femur length, width and thickness of cortical bone, decreased thickness of the tibial growth plate and minimal to mild bone marrow hypocellularity were noted at doses equal to or greater than 14 mg/kg/day (about 3.4 times a daily human dose of 40 mg on a body surface area basis). Physeal dysplasia in the femur was observed in offspring of rats treated with oral doses of esomeprazole magnesium at doses equal to or greater than 138 mg/kg/day (about 33.6 times the daily human dose of 40 mg on a body surface area basis).\n【213】 - Effects on maternal bone were observed in pregnant and lactating rats in the pre- and postnatal toxicity study when esomeprazole magnesium was administered at oral doses of 14 to 280 mg /kg/day (about 3.4 to 57 times an oral human dose of 40 mg on a body surface area basis). When rats were dosed from gestational day 7 through weaning on postnatal day 21, a statistically significant decrease in maternal femur weight of up to 14% (as compared to placebo treatment) was observed at doses equal to or greater than 138 mg/kg/day (about 33.6 times an oral human dose of 40 mg on a body surface area basis).\n【214】 - A pre- and postnatal development study in rats with esomeprazole strontium (using equimolar doses compared to esomeprazole magnesium study) produced similar results in dams and pups as described above.\n【215】 ### Nursing Mothers\n【216】 - VIMOVO is likely present in human milk. The naproxen anion has been found in the milk of lactating women at a concentration equivalent to approximately 1% of maximum naproxen concentration in plasma. Esomeprazole is the S-isomer of omeprazole and limited data indicate that maternal doses of omeprazole 20 mg daily produce low levels in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for VIMOVO and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from the drug or from the underlying maternal condition. Exercise caution when administering VIMOVO to a nursing woman.\n【217】 ### Pediatric Use\n【218】 - The safety and efficacy of VIMOVO has not been established in pediatric patients younger than 18 years.\n【219】 - Juvenile Animal Data\n【220】 - In a juvenile rat toxicity study, esomeprazole was administered with both magnesium and strontium salts at oral doses about 34 to 57 times a daily human dose of 40 mg based on body surface area. Increases in death were seen at the high dose, and at all doses of esomeprazole, there were decreases in body weight, body weight gain, femur weight and femur length, and decreases in overall growth.\n【221】 ### Geriatic Use\n【222】 - Of the total number of patients who received VIMOVO (n=1157) in clinical trials, 387 were ≥65 years of age, of which 85 patients were 75 years and over. No meaningful differences in efficacy or safety were observed between these subjects and younger subjects.\n【223】 - Studies indicate that although total plasma concentration of naproxen is unchanged, the unbound plasma fraction of naproxen is increased in the elderly. Caution is advised when high doses are required and some adjustment of dosage may be required in elderly patients. As with other drugs used in the elderly, it is prudent to use the lowest effective dose.\n【224】 - Experience indicates that geriatric patients may be particularly sensitive to certain adverse effects of NSAIDs. Elderly or debilitated patients seem to tolerate peptic ulceration or bleeding less well when these events do occur. Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in the geriatric population.\n【225】 - Naproxen is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Geriatric patients may be at a greater risk for the development of a form of renal toxicity precipitated by reduced prostaglandin formation during administration of NSAIDs.\n【226】 ### Gender\n【227】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of Naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium with respect to specific gender populations.\n【228】 ### Race\n【229】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of Naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium with respect to specific racial populations.\n【230】 ### Renal Impairment\n【231】 - Naproxen-containing products, including VIMOVO, are not recommended for use in patients with advanced renal disease.\n【232】 ### Hepatic Impairment\n【233】 - VIMOVO should be avoided in patients with severe hepatic impairment because naproxen may increase the risk of renal failure or bleeding and esomeprazole doses should not exceed 20 mg daily in these patients.\n【234】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\n【235】 - Infertility\n【236】 - Data from several small studies in humans and from studies in animals indicate that NSAIDs, including naproxen, may be associated with a reversible delay in ovulation. Therefore, in women who have difficulties conceiving, or who are undergoing investigation of infertility, use of VIMOVO is not recommended.\n【237】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\n【238】 There is no FDA guidance one the use of Naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium in patients who are immunocompromised.\n【239】 # Administration and Monitoring\n【240】 ### Administration\n【241】 - Oral\n【242】 ### Monitoring\n【243】 There is limited information regarding Monitoring of Naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium in the drug label.\n【244】 # IV Compatibility\n【245】 There is limited information regarding IV Compatibility of Naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium in the drug label.\n【246】 # Overdosage\n【247】 - Significant naproxen overdosage may be characterized by lethargy, dizziness, drowsiness, epigastric pain, abdominal discomfort, heartburn, indigestion, nausea, transient alterations in liver function, hypoprothrombinemia, renal dysfunction, metabolic acidosis, apnea, disorientation or vomiting. Gastrointestinal bleeding can occur. Hypertension, acute renal failure, respiratory depression, and coma may occur, but are rare. Anaphylactic reactions have been reported with therapeutic ingestion of NSAIDs, and may occur following an overdose. A few patients have experienced convulsions, but it is not clear whether or not these were drug-related. It is not known what dose of the drug would be life threatening. The oral LD50 of the drug is 543 mg/kg in rats, 1234 mg/kg in mice, 4110 mg/kg in hamsters, and greater than 1000 mg/kg in dogs.\n【248】 - Patients should be managed by symptomatic and supportive care following an NSAID overdose. There are no specific antidotes. Hemodialysis does not decrease the plasma concentration of naproxen because of the high degree of its protein binding. Activated charcoal (60 to 100 g in adults, 1 to 2 g/kg in children) and/or osmotic cathartic may be indicated in patients seen within 4 hours of ingestion with symptoms or following a large overdose. Forced diuresis, alkalinization of urine or hemoperfusion may not be useful due to high protein binding.\n【249】 - A single oral dose of esomeprazole at 510 mg/kg (about 103 times the human dose on a body surface area basis) was lethal to rats. The major signs of acute toxicity were reduced motor activity, changes in respiratory frequency, tremor, ataxia, and intermittent clonic convulsions.\n【250】 - The symptoms described in connection with deliberate esomeprazole overdose (limited experience of doses in excess of 240 mg/day) are transient. Single doses of 80 mg of esomeprazole were uneventful. Reports of overdosage with omeprazole in humans may also be relevant. Doses ranged up to 2,400 mg (120 times the usual recommended clinical dose). Manifestations were variable, but included confusion, drowsiness, blurred vision, tachycardia, nausea, diaphoresis, flushing, headache, dry mouth, and other adverse reactions similar to those seen in normal clinical experience. No specific antidote for esomeprazole is known. Since esomeprazole is extensively protein bound, it is not expected to be removed by dialysis. In the event of overdosage, treatment should be symptomatic and supportive.\n【251】 - If overexposure occurs, call the Poison Control Center at 1-800-222-1222.\n【252】 ## Chronic Overdose\n【253】 There is limited information regarding Chronic Overdose of Naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium in the drug label.\n【254】 # Pharmacology\n【255】 There is limited information regarding Naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium Pharmacology in the drug label.\n【256】 ## Mechanism of Action\n【257】 - VIMOVO consists of an immediate-release esomeprazole magnesium layer and an enteric-coated naproxen core. As a result, esomeprazole is released first in the stomach, prior to the dissolution of naproxen in the small intestine. The enteric coating prevents naproxen release at pH levels below 5.5.\n【258】 - Naproxen is a NSAID with analgesic and antipyretic properties. The mechanism of action of the naproxen anion, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but may be related to prostaglandin synthetase inhibition.\n【259】 - Esomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole is protonated and converted in the acidic compartment of the parietal cell forming the active inhibitor, the achiral sulphenamide. By acting specifically on the proton pump, esomeprazole blocks the final step in acid production, thus reducing gastric acidity. This effect is dose-related up to a daily dose of 20 to 40 mg and leads to inhibition of gastric acid secretion.\n【260】 ## Structure\n【261】 - The active ingredients of VIMOVO are naproxen which is a NSAID and esomeprazole magnesium which is a Proton Pump Inhibitor (PPI).\n【262】 - VIMOVO is available as an oval, yellow, multi-layer, delayed release tablet combining an enteric coated naproxen core and an immediate release esomeprazole magnesium layer surrounding the core. Each strength contains either 375 mg of naproxen and 20 mg of esomeprazole (present as 22.3 mg esomeprazole magnesium trihydrate) or 500 mg of naproxen and 20 mg of esomeprazole (present as 22.3 mg esomeprazole magnesium trihydrate) for oral administration. The inactive ingredients are carnauba wax, colloidal silicon dioxide, croscarmellose sodium, iron oxide yellow, glyceryl monostearate, hypromellose, iron oxide black, magnesium stearate, methacrylic acid copolymer dispersion, methylparaben, polysorbate 80, polydextrose, polyethylene glycol, povidone, propylene glycol, propylparaben, titanium dioxide, and triethyl citrate.\n【263】 - The chemical name for naproxen is (S)-6-methoxy-α-methyl-2-naphthaleneacetic acid. Naproxen has the following structure:\n【264】 - Naproxen has a molecular weight of 230.26 and a molecular formula of C14H14O3.\n【265】 - Naproxen is an odorless, white to off-white crystalline substance. It is lipid soluble, practically insoluble in water at low pH and freely soluble in water at high pH. The octanol/water partition coefficient of naproxen at pH 7.4 is 1.6 to 1.8.\n【266】 - The chemical name for esomeprazole is bis(5-methoxy-2-sulfinyl]-1H-benzimidazole-1-yl) magnesium trihydrate. Esomeprazole is the S-isomer of omeprazole, which is a mixture of the S- and R- isomers. Its molecular formula is (C17H18N3O3S)2Mg × 3 H2O with molecular weight of 767.2 as a trihydrate and 713.1 on an anhydrous basis. The structural formula is:\n【267】 - The magnesium salt is a white to slightly colored crystalline powder. It contains 3 moles of water of solvation and is slightly soluble in water.\n【268】 - The stability of esomeprazole magnesium is a function of pH; it rapidly degrades in acidic media, but it has acceptable stability under alkaline conditions. At pH 6.8 (buffer), the half-life of the magnesium salt is about 19 hours at 25°C and about 8 hours at 37°C.\n【269】 ## Pharmacodynamics\n【270】 - Antisecretory Activity\n【271】 - The effect of VIMOVO on intragastric pH was determined in 25 healthy volunteers in one study. Three VIMOVO combinations (naproxen 500 mg combined with either esomeprazole 10, 20, or 30 mg) were administered twice daily over 9 days. The results are shown in the following table:'\n【272】 - Serum Gastrin Effects\n【273】 - The effect of esomeprazole on serum gastrin concentrations was evaluated in approximately 2,700 patients in clinical trials up to 8 weeks and in over 1,300 patients for up to 6-12 months. The mean fasting gastrin level increased in a dose-related manner. This increase reached a plateau within two to three months of therapy and returned to baseline levels within four weeks after discontinuation of therapy.\n【274】 - Increased gastrin causes enterochromaffin-like cell hyperplasia and increased serum Chromogranin A (CgA) levels. The increased CgA levels may cause false positive results in diagnostic investigations for neuroendocrine tumors. Healthcare providers should temporarily stop esomeprazole treatment at least 14 days before assessing CgA levels and consider repeating the test if initial CgA levels are high.\n【275】 - Enterochromaffin-like (ECL) Cell Effects\n【276】 - In over 1,000 patients treated with esomeprazole (10, 20 or 40 mg/day) up to 6-12 months, the prevalence of ECL cell hyperplasia increased with time and dose. No patient developed ECL cell carcinoids, dysplasia, or neoplasia in the gastric mucosa.\n【277】 - Endocrine Effects\n【278】 - Esomeprazole had no effect on thyroid function when given in oral doses of 20 or 40 mg for 4 weeks. Other effects of esomeprazole on the endocrine system were assessed using omeprazole studies. Omeprazole given in oral doses of 30 or 40 mg for 2 to 4 weeks had no effect on carbohydrate metabolism, circulating levels of parathyroid hormone, cortisol, estradiol, testosterone, prolactin, cholecystokinin or secretin.\n【279】 - Effects on Gastrointestinal Microbial Ecology\n【280】 - Decreased gastric acidity due to any means including proton pump inhibitors, increases gastric counts of bacteria normally present in the gastrointestinal tract. Treatment with proton pump inhibitors may lead to slightly increased risk of gastrointestinal infections such as Salmonella and Campylobacter and, in hospitalized patients, possibly also Clostridium difficile.\n【281】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n【282】 - Absorption\n【283】 - Naproxen\n【284】 - At steady state following administration of VIMOVO twice daily, peak plasma concentrations of naproxen are reached on average 3 hours following both the morning and the evening dose.\n【285】 - Bioequivalence between VIMOVO and enteric-coated naproxen, based on both area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of naproxen, has been demonstrated for both the 375 mg and 500 mg doses.\n【286】 - Naproxen is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract with an in vivo bioavailability of 95%.\n【287】 - Steady-state levels of naproxen are reached in 4 to 5 days.\n【288】 - Esomeprazole\n【289】 - Following administration of VIMOVO twice daily, esomeprazole is rapidly absorbed with peak plasma concentration reached within on average, 0.43 to 1.2 hours, following the morning and evening dose on both the first day of administration and at steady state. The peak plasma concentrations of esomeprazole are higher at steady state compared to on first day of dosing of VIMOVO.\n【290】 - Figure 1 represents the pharmacokinetics of naproxen and esomeprazole following administration of VIMOVO 500 mg/20 mg.\n【291】 - Food effect\n【292】 - Administration of VIMOVO together with high-fat food in healthy volunteers does not affect the extent of absorption of naproxen but significantly prolongs tmax by 10 hours and decreases peak plasma concentration (Cmax) by about 12%.\n【293】 - Administration of VIMOVO together with high-fat food in healthy volunteers delays tmax of esomeprazole by 1 hour and significantly reduces the extent of absorption, resulting in 52% and 75% reductions of area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) and peak plasma concentration (Cmax), respectively.\n【294】 - Administration of VIMOVO 30 minutes before high-fat food intake in healthy volunteers does not affect the extent of absorption of naproxen but delays the absorption by about 4 hours and decreases peak plasma concentration (Cmax) by about 17%, but has no significant effect on the rate or extent of esomeprazole absorption compared to administration under fasted conditions.\n【295】 - Administration of VIMOVO 60 minutes before high-fat food intake in healthy volunteers has no effect on the rate and extent of naproxen absorption; however, increases the esomeprazole AUC by 25% and Cmax by 50% compared to administration under fasted conditions. This increase in esomeprazole Cmax does not raise a safety issue since the approved dosing regimen of esomeprazole at 40 mg QD would result in higher Cmax.\n【296】 - Therefore, VIMOVO should be taken at least 30 minutes before the meal.\n【297】 - Distribution\n【298】 - Naproxen\n【299】 - Naproxen has a volume of distribution of 0.16 L/kg. At therapeutic levels naproxen is greater than 99% albumin-bound. At doses of naproxen greater than 500 mg/day there is less than proportional increase in plasma levels due to an increase in clearance caused by saturation of plasma protein binding at higher doses (average trough Css 36.5, 49.2 and 56.4 mg/L with 500, 1000 and 1500 mg daily doses of naproxen, respectively). The naproxen anion has been found in the milk of lactating women at a concentration equivalent to approximately 1% of maximum naproxen concentration in plasma.\n【300】 - Esomeprazole\n【301】 - The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy subjects is approximately 16L. Esomeprazole is 97% plasma protein bound.\n【302】 - Metabolism\n【303】 - Naproxen\n【304】 - Naproxen is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 system (CYP), CYP2C9 and CYP1A2, to 6-0-desmethyl naproxen. Neither the parent drug nor the metabolites induce metabolizing enzymes. Both naproxen and 6-0-desmethyl naproxen are further metabolized to their respective acylglucuronide conjugated metabolites. Consistent with the half-life of naproxen, the area under the plasma concentration time curve increases with repeated dosing of VIMOVO twice daily.\n【305】 - Esomeprazole\n【306】 - Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the CYP enzyme system. The major part of the metabolism of esomeprazole is dependent on the polymorphic CYP2C19, responsible for the formation of the hydroxyl- and desmethyl metabolites of esomeprazole. The remaining part is dependent on another specific isoform CYP3A4, responsible for the formation of esomeprazole sulphone, the main metabolite in plasma. The major metabolites of esomeprazole have no effect on gastric acid secretion.\n【307】 - The area under the plasma esomeprazole concentration-time curve increases with repeated administration of VIMOVO. This increase is dose-dependent and results in a non-linear dose-AUC relationship after repeated administration. An increased absorption of esomeprazole with repeated administration of VIMOVO probably also contributes to the time-and dose-dependency.\n【308】 - Excretion\n【309】 - Naproxen\n【310】 - Following administration of VIMOVO twice daily, the mean elimination half-life for naproxen is approximately 15 hours following the evening dose, with no change with repeated dosing.\n【311】 - The clearance of naproxen is 0.13 mL/min/kg. Approximately 95% of the naproxen from any dose is excreted in the urine, primarily as naproxen (<1%), 6-0-desmethyl naproxen (<1%) or their conjugates (66% to 92%). Small amounts, 3% or less of the administered dose, are excreted in the feces. In patients with renal failure, metabolites may accumulate.\n【312】 - Esomeprazole\n【313】 - Following administration of VIMOVO twice daily, the mean elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1 hour following both the morning and evening dose on day 1, with a slightly longer elimination half-life at steady state (1.2-1.5 hours).\n【314】 - Almost 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as metabolites in the urine, the remainder in the feces. Less than 1% of the parent drug is found in the urine.\n【315】 - Concomitant Use with Clopidogrel\n【316】 - Results from a crossover study in healthy subjects have shown a pharmacokinetic interaction between clopidogrel (300 mg loading dose/75 mg daily maintenance dose) and esomeprazole (40 mg p.o. once daily) when co-administered for 30 days. Exposure to the active metabolite of clopidogrel was reduced by 35% to 40% over this time period. Pharmacodynamic parameters were also measured and demonstrated that the change in inhibition of platelet aggregation was related to the change in the exposure to clopidogrel active metabolite.\n【317】 - Special Populations\n【318】 - Geriatric Patients\n【319】 - There is no specific data on the pharmacokinetics of VIMOVO in patients over age 65.\n【320】 - Studies indicate that although total plasma concentration of naproxen is unchanged, the unbound plasma fraction of naproxen is increased in the elderly, although the unbound fraction is <1% of the total naproxen concentration. Unbound trough naproxen concentrations in elderly subjects have been reported to range from 0.12% to 0.19% of total naproxen concentration, compared with 0.05% to 0.075% in younger subjects. The clinical significance of this finding is unclear, although it is possible that the increase in free naproxen concentration could be associated with an increase in the rate of adverse events per a given dosage in some elderly patients.\n【321】 - The AUC and Cmax values of esomeprazole were slightly higher (25% and 18%, respectively) in the elderly as compared to younger subjects at steady state. Dosage adjustment for the esomeprazole component based on age is not necessary.\n【322】 - Race\n【323】 - Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been studied for naproxen.\n【324】 - Approximately 3% of Caucasians and 15 to 20% of Asians lack a functional CYP2C19 enzyme and are called poor metabolizers. In these individuals the metabolism of esomeprazole is probably mainly catalyzed by CYP3A4. After repeated once-daily administration of 40 mg esomeprazole, the mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve was approximately 100% higher in poor metabolizers than in subjects having a functional CYP2C19 enzyme (extensive metabolizers).\n【325】 - Hepatic Insufficiency\n【326】 - The pharmacokinetics of VIMOVO or naproxen have not been determined in subjects with hepatic impairment.\n【327】 - In patients with severe hepatic impairment, VIMOVO should be avoided due to increase of risk of NSAID associated bleeding and/or renal failure associated with naproxen.\n【328】 - Chronic alcoholic liver disease and probably also other forms of cirrhosis reduce the total plasma concentration of naproxen, but the plasma concentration of unbound naproxen is increased. The implication of this finding for the naproxen component of VIMOVO dosing is unknown but it is prudent to use the lowest effective dose.\n【329】 - The AUCs of esomeprazole in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency (Child Pugh Class C) have been shown to be 2-3 times higher than in patients with normal liver function. For this reason, it has been recommended that esomeprazole doses not exceed 20 mg daily in patients with severe hepatic impairment. However, there is no dose adjustment necessary for patients with Child Pugh Class A and B for the esomeprazole component of VIMOVO. There is no VIMOVO dosage form that contains less than 20 mg esomeprazole for twice daily dosing.\n【330】 - Renal Insufficiency\n【331】 - The pharmacokinetics of VIMOVO or naproxen have not been determined in subjects with renal impairment.\n【332】 - Given that naproxen, its metabolites and conjugates are primarily excreted by the kidney, the potential exists for naproxen metabolites to accumulate in the presence of renal insufficiency. Elimination of naproxen is decreased in patients with severe renal impairment. Naproxen-containing products, including VIMOVO, is not recommended for use in patients with moderate to severe and severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 ml/min).\n【333】 - No studies have been performed with esomeprazole in patients with decreased renal function. Since the kidney is responsible for the excretion of the metabolites of esomeprazole but not for the elimination of the parent compound, the metabolism of esomeprazole is not expected to be changed in patients with impaired renal function.\n【334】 - Gender\n【335】 - The AUC and Cmax values of esomeprazole were slightly higher (13%) in females than in males at steady state. Dosage adjustment for the esomeprazole component based on gender is not necessary.\n【336】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\n【337】 - Naproxen\n【338】 - A 2-year study was performed in rats to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of naproxen at rat doses of 8, 16, and 24 mg/kg/day (50, 100, and 150 mg/m2). The maximum dose used was 0.28 times the highest recommended human dose. No evidence of tumorigenicity was found.\n【339】 - Esomeprazole\n【340】 - The carcinogenic potential of esomeprazole was assessed using omeprazole studies, of which esomeprazole is an enantiomer. In two 24-month oral carcinogenicity studies in rats, omeprazole at daily doses of 1.7, 3.4, 13.8, 44 and 140.8 mg/kg/day (about 0.35 to 28 times the human dose of 40 mg/day expressed on a body surface area basis) produced gastric ECL cell carcinoids in a dose-related manner in both male and female rats; the incidence of this effect was markedly higher in female rats, which had higher blood levels of omeprazole. Gastric carcinoids seldom occur in the untreated rat. In addition, ECL cell hyperplasia was present in all treated groups of both sexes. In one of these studies, female rats were treated with 13.8 mg omeprazole/kg/day (about 2.8 times the human dose of 40 mg/day on a body surface area basis) for 1 year, then followed for an additional year without the drug. No carcinoids were seen in these rats. An increased incidence of treatment-related ECL cell hyperplasia was observed at the end of 1 year (94% treated vs 10% controls). By the second year the difference between treated and control rats was much smaller (46% vs 26%) but still showed more hyperplasia in the treated group. Gastric adenocarcinoma was seen in one rat (2%). No similar tumor was seen in male or female rats treated for 2 years. For this strain of rat no similar tumor has been noted historically, but a finding involving only one tumor is difficult to interpret. A 78-week mouse carcinogenicity study of omeprazole did not show increased tumor occurrence, but the study was not conclusive.\n【341】 - Esomeprazole was negative in the Ames mutation test, in the in vivo rat bone marrow cell chromosome aberration test, and the in vivo mouse micronucleus test. Esomeprazole, however, was positive in the in vitro human lymphocyte chromosome aberration test. Omeprazole was positive in the in vitro human lymphocyte chromosome aberration test, the in vivo mouse bone marrow cell chromosome aberration test, and the in vivo mouse micronucleus test.\n【342】 - The potential effects of esomeprazole on fertility and reproductive performance were assessed using omeprazole studies. Omeprazole at oral doses up to 138 mg/kg/day in rats (about 28 times the human dose of 40 mg/day on a body surface area basis) was found to have no effect on reproductive performance of parental animals.\n【343】 - Naproxen\n【344】 - Reproduction studies have been performed in rats at 20 mg/kg/day (125 mg/m2/day, 0.23 times the maximum recommended human dose), rabbits at 20 mg/kg/day (220 mg/m2/day, 0.27 times the maximum recommended human dose), and mice at 170 mg/kg/day (510 mg/m2/day, 0.28 times the maximum recommended human dose) with no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to the drug. However, animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response.\n【345】 - Esomeprazole – Reproduction Studies\n【346】 - Reproduction studies have been performed in rats at oral doses up to 280 mg/kg/day (about 57 times an oral human dose of 40 mg on a body surface area basis) and in rabbits at oral doses up to 86 mg/kg/day (about 35 times an oral human dose of 40 mg on a body surface area basis) and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to esomeprazole.\n【347】 - Esomeprazole – Juvenile Animal Data\n【348】 - A 28-day toxicity study with a 14-day recovery phase was conducted in juvenile rats with esomeprazole magnesium at doses of 70 to 280 mg /kg/day (about 17 to 57 times a daily oral human dose of 40 mg on a body surface area basis). An increase in the number of deaths at the high dose of 280 mg /kg/day was observed when juvenile rats were administered esomeprazole magnesium from postnatal day 7 through postnatal day 35. In addition, doses equal to or greater than 140 mg/kg/day (about 34 times a daily oral human dose of 40 mg on a body surface area basis), produced treatment-related decreases in body weight (approximately 14%) and body weight gain, decreases in femur weight and femur length, and affected overall growth. Comparable findings described above have also been observed in this study with another esomeprazole salt, esomeprazole strontium, at equimolar doses of esomeprazole.\n【349】 # Clinical Studies\n【350】 - Two randomized, multi-center, double-blind trials (Study 1 and Study 2) compared the incidence of gastric ulcer formation in 428 patients taking VIMOVO and 426 patients taking enteric-coated naproxen. Subjects were at least 18 years of age with a medical condition expected to require daily NSAID therapy for at least 6 months, and, if less than 50 years old, with a documented history of gastric or duodenal ulcer within the past 5 years. The majority of patients were female (67%), white (86%). The majority of patients were 50-69 years of age (83%). Approximately one quarter were on low-dose aspirin.\n【351】 - Studies 1 and 2 showed that VIMOVO given as 500 mg/20 mg twice daily statistically significantly reduced the 6-month cumulative incidence of gastric ulcers compared to enteric-coated naproxen 500 mg twice daily (see Table 4).\n【352】 - Approximately a quarter of the patients in Studies 1 and 2 were taking concurrent low-dose aspirin (≤ 325 mg daily). The results for this subgroup analysis in patients who used aspirin were consistent with the overall findings of the study.\n【353】 - The results at one month, three months, and six months are presented in Table 4.\n【354】 - In these trials, patients receiving VIMOVO had a mean duration of therapy of 152 days compared to 124 days in patients receiving enteric-coated naproxen alone. A higher proportion of patients taking EC-naproxen (12%) discontinued the study due to upper GI adverse events (including duodenal ulcers) compared to VIMOVO (4%) in both trials.\n【355】 - The efficacy of VIMOVO in treating the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis was established in two 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in patients with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. In these two trials, patients were allowed to remain on low-dose aspirin for cardioprophylaxis. VIMOVO was given as 500 mg/20 mg twice daily. In each trial, patients receiving VIMOVO had significantly better results compared to patients receiving placebo as measured by change from baseline of the WOMAC pain subscale and the WOMAC physical function subscale and a Patient Global Assessment Score.\n【356】 - Based on studies with enteric-coated naproxen, improvement in patients treated for rheumatoid arthritis was demonstrated by a reduction in joint swelling, a reduction in duration of morning stiffness, a reduction in disease activity as assessed by both the investigator and patient, and by increased mobility as demonstrated by a reduction in walking time. In patients with osteoarthritis, the therapeutic action of naproxen has been shown by a reduction in joint pain or tenderness, an increase in range of motion in knee joints, increased mobility as demonstrated by a reduction in walking time, and improvement in capacity to perform activities of daily living impaired by the disease. In patients with ankylosing spondylitis, naproxen has been shown to decrease night pain, morning stiffness and pain at rest.\n【357】 # How Supplied\n【358】 - VIMOVO 375 mg/20 mg tablets are oval, yellow film-coated tablets printed with 375/20 in black ink, supplied as:\n【359】 - NDC 75987-031-04     Bottles of 60 tablets\n【360】 - VIMOVO 500 mg/20 mg tablets are oval, yellow film-coated tablets printed with 500/20 in black ink, supplied as:\n【361】 - NDC 75987-030-04     Bottles of 60 tablets\n【362】 - Storage\n【363】 - Store at 25°C (77°F); excursions permitted to 15-30°C (59-86°F). Store in the original container and keep the bottle tightly closed to protect from moisture. Dispense in a tight container if package is subdivided.\n【364】 ## Storage\n【365】 There is limited information regarding Naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium Storage in the drug label.\n【366】 # Images\n【367】 ## Drug Images\n【368】 ## Package and Label Display Panel\n【369】 # Patient Counseling Information\n【370】 - Patients should be informed of the following before initiating therapy with VIMOVO and periodically during the course of ongoing therapy. Patients should also be encouraged to read the NSAID Medication Guide that accompanies each prescription dispensed.\n【371】 - VIMOVO, like other NSAID-containing products, may cause serious cardiovascular side effects, such as myocardial infarction or stroke, which may result in hospitalization and even death. Although serious cardiovascular events can occur without warning symptoms, patients should be alert for the signs and symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath, weakness, slurring of speech, and should ask for medical advice when observing any indicative sign or symptoms. Patients should be apprised of the importance of this follow-up.\n【372】 - VIMOVO has been developed with esomeprazole to decrease incidence of ulceration from naproxen. NSAIDs, including naproxen, can cause GI discomfort and, rarely, serious GI side effects, such as ulcers and bleeding, which may result in hospitalization and even death. Although serious GI tract ulcerations and bleeding can occur without warning symptoms, patients should be alert for the signs and symptoms of ulcerations and bleeding, and should ask for medical advice when observing any indicative sign or symptoms including epigastric pain, dyspepsia, melena, and hematemesis. Patients should be apprised of the importance of this follow-up.\n【373】 - VIMOVO, like other NSAID-containing products, can cause serious skin side effects such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis, which may result in hospitalizations and even death. Although serious skin reactions may occur without warning, patients should be alert for the signs and symptoms of skin rash and blisters, fever, or other signs of hypersensitivity such as itching, and should ask for medical advice when observing any indicative signs or symptoms. Patients should be advised to stop the drug immediately if they develop any type of rash and contact their physicians as soon as possible.\n【374】 - Patients should promptly report signs or symptoms of unexplained weight gain or edema to their physicians.\n【375】 - Patients should be informed of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and \"flu-like\" symptoms). If these occur, patients should be instructed to stop therapy and seek immediate medical therapy.\n【376】 - Patients should be informed of the signs of an anaphylactic reaction (e.g., difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat). If these occur, patients should be instructed to seek immediate emergency help.\n【377】 - Starting at 30 weeks gestation, VIMOVO, as with other NSAIDs, should be avoided because it may cause premature closure of the ductus arteriosus.\n【378】 - Caution should be exercised by patients whose activities require alertness if they experience drowsiness, dizziness, vertigo or depression during therapy with VIMOVO.\n【379】 - Patients should be instructed to tell their physicians if they have a history of asthma or aspirin-sensitive asthma because the use of NSAIDs in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma has been associated with severe bronchospasm, which can be fatal. Patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity should be instructed not to take VIMOVO. Patients with preexisting asthma should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if their asthma worsens after taking VIMOVO.\n【380】 - Antacids may be used while taking VIMOVO.\n【381】 - VIMOVO tablets should be swallowed whole with liquid. Tablets should not be split, chewed, crushed or dissolved.

Plane xanthomas are characterised by yellowish to orange, flat macules or slightly elevated plaques, often with a central white area which may be localised or generalised. They often arise in the skin folds, especially the palmar creases. They occur in hyperlipoproteinaemia type III and type IIA, and in association with biliary cirrhosis.

It is also called  the belly or venter. In humans, and in many other vertebrates, it is the region between the thorax and the pelvis (Separating the thoracic cavity and the abdominal cavity is the thoracic diaphragm). In fully developed insects, the abdomen is the third (or posterior) segment, after the head and thorax.\n【3】 # Vertebrates\n【4】 In vertebrates, the abdomen contains several organs:\n【5】 - Part of the digestive system (gallbladder, liver, anus, appendix, rectum, and intestines),\n【6】 - Part of the urinary system (ureters, bladder, urethra).\n【7】 - The internal reproductive organs (ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, vulva, and vagina in women, testes, vas deferens, seminal vesicles, prostate, penis and urethra in men)\n【8】 The abdomen also contains some of the largest and most easily accessible blood vessels in many animals, and is often used in medicine  experimentation for catheterisation.\n【9】 For various reasons, the abdomen is often coloured differently from the rest of the body.  In animals with furry or hairy bodies, the abdomen is frequently hairless, or nearly so.\n【10】 The abdomen is oval in shape and is the largest cavity in the body.  It can be broken down into the lower and upper extremity.  The lower extremity covers the inner surface of the bony pelvis.  The Levator ani and Coccygeus are located on either side\n【11】 The diaphragm forms the upper extremity and acts as a dome over the abdomen extending to the upper border of the fifth rib. It is an element in the anterior chain.\n【12】 # Invertebrates\n【13】 The invertebrate abdomen is built up of a series of concave upper plates known as tergites and convex lower plates known as sternites, the whole being held together by a tough yet stretchable membrane.\n【14】 The abdomen contains the insect's digestive tract and reproductive organs, it consists of eleven segments in most orders of insects though the eleventh segment is absent in the adult of most higher orders. The number of these segments does vary from species to species with the number of segments visible reduced to only seven in the common honeybee. In the Collembola (Springtails) the abdomen has only six segments.\n【15】 Unlike other Arthropods, insects possess no legs on the abdomen in adult form, though the Protura do have rudimentary leg-like appendages on the first three abdominal segments, and Archaeognatha possess small, articulated \"styli\" which are sometimes considered to be rudimentary appendages. Many larval insects including the Lepidoptera and the Symphyta (Sawflies) have fleshy appendages called prolegs on their abdominal segments (as well as their more familiar thoracic legs), which allow them to grip onto the edges of plant leaves as they walk around.", "title": "Abdomen", "tags": "", "lang": "", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"id\": \"56046660e751a3ae144afac8d7ee9ffd47813f42\", \"source\": \"wikidoc\", \"url\": \"https://www.wikidoc.org/index.php/Abdomen\", \"overview\": \"None\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-01-28 23:08:00", "update_time": "2024-02-18 22:38:57"}

Because in most accelerators the particle trajectories are bent by magnetic fields, synchrotron radiation is also called Magneto-Bremsstrahlung. The emitted spectrum is broadband from the microwave (harmonics of the driving RF field) to x-ray spectral regions. The radiation is vertically collimated and polarized. The synchrotron radiation output can be calculated if the electron energy, bending radius, electron current, angle relative to the orbital plane, the distance to the tangent point and vertical and horizontal acceptance angles are known.\"\n【4】 # Cyclotron radiation\n【5】 Forms of decametric radio signals from Jupiter:\n【6】 - bursts (with a wavelength of tens of meters) vary with the rotation of Jupiter, and are influenced by interaction of Io with Jupiter's magnetic field.\n【7】 - emission (with wavelengths measured in centimeters) was first observed by Frank Drake and Hein Hvatum in 1959. The origin of this signal was from a torus-shaped belt around Jupiter's equator. This signal is caused by cyclotron radiation from electrons that are accelerated in Jupiter's magnetic field.\n【8】 # Theoretical synchrotron radiation\n【9】 Def. \"the electromagnetic radiation emitted by the accelerating charged particles in a synchrotron that are moving at near the speed of light\"\"the electromagnetic radiation emitted by the accelerating charged particles in a synchrotron that are moving at near the speed of light\" is called synchrotron radiation.\n【10】 \"We now assume that the γ-rays are produced  by relativistic electrons via Compton scattering of synchrotron photons (SSC). In any such model, the fact that the γ-rays luminosity, produced via Compton scattering, is higher than that emitted at lower frequencies (1014 - 1016 Hz), supposedly via the synchrotron process, implies a radiation energy density, Ur, higher than the magnetic energy density, UB. From the observed power ratio we derive that Ur must be one order of magnitude greater than UB, which may be a lower limit if Klein-Nishina effects reduce the efficiency of the self-Compton emission. This result is independent of the degree of beaming, which, for a homogeneous source, affects both the synchrotron and the self-Compton fluxes in the same way. This source is therefore the first observed case of the result of a Compton catastrophe (Hoyle, Burbidge, & Sargent 1966).\"\n【11】 # Sources\n【12】 Astrophysical X-ray sources are astronomical objects with physical properties which result in the emission of X-rays.\n【13】 There are a number of types of astrophysical objects which emit X-rays, from galaxy clusters, through black holes in active galactic nuclei (AGN) to galactic objects such as supernova remnants, stars, and binary stars containing a white dwarf (cataclysmic variable stars and super soft X-ray sources), neutron star or black hole (X-ray binaries). Some solar system bodies emit X-rays, the most notable being the Moon, although most of the X-ray brightness of the Moon arises from reflected solar X-rays. A combination of many unresolved X-ray sources is thought to produce the observed X-ray background. The X-ray continuum can arise from bremsstrahlung, either magnetic or ordinary Coulomb, black-body radiation, synchrotron radiation, inverse Compton scattering of lower-energy photons be relativistic electrons, knock-on collisions of fast protons with atomic electrons, and atomic recombination, with or without additional electron transitions.\n【14】 The origin of all observed astronomical X-ray sources is in, near to, or associated with a coronal cloud or gas at coronal cloud temperatures for however long or brief a period.\n【15】 For some plasma sources, \"an exponential spectrum corresponding to a thermal bremsstrahlung source \":\n【16】 N(E)dE = E0-1 - exp-E/kTdE.\n【17】 dN/dE = (E0/E) - exp-E/kT, where a least squares fit to the radiated detection data yields a kT.\n【18】 Another equation used to study astronomical events is the power law:\n【19】 In terms of radiation detected, for example, f(x) = photons (cm2-sec-keV)-1 versus keV. As the photon flux decreases with increasing keV, the exponent (k) is negative. Observations of X-rays have sometimes found the spectrum to have an upper portion with k ~ -2.3 and the lower portion being steeper with k ~ -4.7. This suggests a two stage acceleration process.\n【20】 The synchrotron functions are defined as follows (for x ≥ 0):\n【21】 - First synchrotron function\n【22】 - Second synchrotron function\n【23】 where Kj is the modified Bessel function of the second kind.  The function F(x) is shown on the right, as the output from a plot in Mathematica.\n【24】 In astrophysics, x is usually a ratio of frequencies, that is, the frequency over a critical frequency (critical frequency is the frequency at which most synchrotron radiation is radiated).  This is needed when calculating the spectra for different types of synchrotron emission.  It takes a spectrum of electrons (or any charged particle) generated by a separate process (such as a power law distribution of electrons and positrons from a constant injection spectrum) and converts this to the spectrum of photons generated by the input electrons/positrons.\n【25】 # Electromagnetics\n【26】 \"The magnetic field is well-ordered in many jets, as shown by polarization measurements. Synchrotron radiation can be very highly polarized (50%) if the field is globally ordered, and some sources  this level. The electric vectors show clear structure and alignment; an especially common pattern is for the field lines to be along the jet in the inner portions and transition to an azimuthal configuration farther out. This is seen in .\"\n【27】 # Continua\n【28】 Like X-rays, the gamma-ray continuum can arise from bremsstrahlung, black-body radiation, synchrotron radiation, or what is called inverse Compton scattering of lower-energy photons by relativistic electrons, knock-on collisions of fast protons with atomic electrons, and atomic recombination, with or without additional electron transitions.\n【29】 The radio continuum from an active galactic nucleus is always due to a jet. It shows a spectrum characteristic of synchrotron radiation.\n【30】 \"he diffuse blue region is predominantly produced by synchrotron radiation, which is radiation given off by the curving motion of electrons in a magnetic field. The radiation corresponded to electrons moving at speeds up to half the speed of light.\"\n【31】 A synchrotron model for the continuum spectrum of the Crab Nebula fits the radiation given off.\n【32】 In the Crab Nebula X-ray spectrum there are three features that differ greatly from Scorpius X-1: its spectrum is much harder, its source diameter is in light-years (ly)s, not astronomical units (AU), and its radio and optical synchrotron emission are strong. Its overall X-ray luminosity rivals the optical emission and could be that of a nonthermal plasma. However, the Crab Nebula appears as an X-ray source that is a central freely expanding ball of dilute plasma, where the energy content is 100 times the total energy content of the large visible and radio portion, obtained from the unknown source.\n【33】 # Emissions\n【34】 Alpha decay is characterized by the emission of an alpha particle, a 4He nucleus. The mode of this decay causes the parent nucleus to decrease by two protons and two neutrons. This type of decay follows the relation:\n【35】 {}_Z^A\\!X\\to {}_{Z-2}^{A-4}\\!Y+ {}_4^2\\alpha \n【36】 Neutron activation is the process in which neutron radiation induces radioactivity in materials, and occurs when atomic nuclei capture free neutrons, becoming heavier and entering excited states. The excited nucleus often decays immediately by emitting particles such as neutrons, protons, or alpha particles. The neutron capture, even after any intermediate decay, often results in the formation of an unstable activation product. Such radioactive nuclei can exhibit half-lives ranging from small fractions of a second to many years.\n【37】 Proton emission (also known as proton radioactivity) is a type of radioactive decay in which a proton is ejected from a nucleus. Proton emission can occur from high-lying excited states in a nucleus following a beta decay, in which case the process is known as beta-delayed proton emission, or can occur from the ground state (or a low-lying  isomer) of very proton-rich nuclei, in which case the process is very similar to alpha decay.\n【38】 Beta decay is characterized by the emission of a neutrino and a negatron which is equivalent to an electron. This process occurs when a nucleus has an excess of neutrons with respect to protons, as compared to the stable isobar. This type of transition converts a neutron into a proton; similarly, a positron is released when a proton is converted into a neutron. These decays follows the relation:\n【39】 {}_Z^A\\!X\\to {}_{Z+1}^A\\!Y+ \\bar{\\nu} + \\beta^-\n【40】 {}_Z^A\\!X\\to {}_{Z-1}^A\\!Y+ \\nu + \\beta^+ \n【41】 Gamma ray emission is follows the previously discussed modes of decay when the decay leaves a daughter nucleus in an excited state.  This nucleus is capable of further de-excitation to a lower energy state by the release of a photon. This decay follows the relation:\n【42】 {}^A\\!X^- \\to {}^A\\!Y + \\gamma \n【43】 Generation of electromagnetic radiation can occur whenever charged particles pass within certain distances of each other without being in fixed orbits, the accelerations (or decelerations) may give off the radiation. This is partly illustrated by the diagram at right where an electron has its course altered by near passage by a positive particle. Bremsstrahlung radiation also occurs when two electrons or other similarly charged particles pass close enough to deflect, slow down, or speed up at least one of the particles.\n【44】 Bremsstrahlung includes synchrotron and cyclotron radiation.\n【45】 When high-energy radiation bombards materials, the excited atoms within emit characteristic \"secondary\" (or fluorescent) radiation.\n【46】 # Accelerator physics\n【47】 Accelerator physics consists of two basic parts: particle acceleration and beam dynamics. \"Accelerator physics relates primarily to the interaction of charged particles with electromagnetic fields.\"\n【48】 Def. \"he interplay between particles and fields is called beam dynamics.\" Boldening is added.\n【49】 \"α particles escaping the Coulomb barrier of Ra and Th nuclei\" is a natural radioactive accelerator. \"Cosmic rays arise from galactic source accelerators.\"\n【50】 A cyclotron is a compact type of particle accelerator in which charged particles in a static magnetic field are travelling outwards from the center along a spiral path and get accelerated by radio frequency electromagnetic fields. ... Cyclotrons accelerate charged particle beams using a high frequency alternating voltage which is applied between two \"D\"-shaped electrodes (also called \"dees\"). An additional static magnetic field B is applied in perpendicular direction to the electrode plane, enabling particles to re-encounter the accelerating voltage many times at the same phase. To achieve this, the voltage frequency must match the particle's cyclotron resonance frequency\n【51】 with the relativistic mass m and its charge q. This frequency is given by equality of centripetal force and magnetic Lorentz force. The particles, injected near the center of the magnetic field, increase their kinetic energy only when recirculating through the gap between the electrodes; thus they travel outwards along a spiral path.\n【52】 Cyclotron radiation is electromagnetic radiation emitted by moving charged particles deflected by a magnetic field. The Lorentz force on the particles acts perpendicular to both the magnetic field lines and the particles' motion through them, creating an acceleration of charged particles that causes them to emit radiation (and to spiral around the magnetic field lines). Cyclotron radiation is emitted by all charged particles travelling through magnetic fields, however, not just those in cyclotrons. Cyclotron radiation from plasma in the interstellar medium or around black holes and other astronomical phenomena is an important source of information about distant magnetic fields. The power (energy per unit time) of the emission of each electron can be calculated using:\n【53】 {-dE \\over dt}={\\sigma_t B^2 V^2 \\over c \\mu_o} \n【54】 where E is energy, t is time,  \\sigma_t  is the Thomson cross section (total, not differential), B is the magnetic field strength, V is the velocity perpendicular to the magnetic field, c is the speed of light and  \\mu_o  is the permeability of free space.\n【55】 A synchrotron is a particular type of cyclic particle accelerator originating from the cyclotron in which the guiding magnetic field (bending the particles into a closed path) is time-dependent, being synchronized to a particle beam of increasing kinetic energy. The synchrotron is one of the first accelerator concepts that enable the construction of large-scale facilities, since bending, beam focusing and acceleration can be separated into different components. Unlike in a cyclotron, synchrotrons are unable to accelerate particles from zero kinetic energy; one of the obvious reasons for this is that its closed particle path would be cut by a device that emits particles. Thus, schemes were developed to inject pre-accelerated particle beams into a synchrotron. The pre-acceleration can be realized by a chain of other accelerator structures like a linac, a microtron or another synchrotron; all of these in turn need to be fed by a particle source comprising a simple high voltage power supply, typically a Cockcroft-Walton generator.\n【56】 # Protons\n【57】 \"Radio observations at 210 GHz taken by the Bernese Multibeam Radiometer for KOSMA (BEMRAK)  at submillimeter wavelengths  starts simultaneously with high-energy (>200 MeV nucleon−1) proton acceleration and the production of pions. The derived radio source size is compact (≤10\"), and the emission is cospatial with the location of precipitating flare-accelerated >30 MeV protons as seen in γ-ray imaging.\"\n【58】 In the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) proton bunches also produce synchrotron radiation at increasing amplitude and frequency as they accelerate with respect to the vacuum field, propagating photoelectrons, which in turn propagate secondary electrons from the pipe walls with increasing frequency and density up to 7x1010. Each proton may lose 6.7keV per turn due to this phenomenon.\n【59】 # Electrons\n【60】 \"Radio observations at 210 GHz taken by the Bernese Multibeam Radiometer for KOSMA (BEMRAK)  high-energy particle acceleration during the energetic solar flare of 2003 October 28  at submillimeter wavelengths  a gradual, long-lasting (>30 minutes) component with large apparent source sizes (~60\").

However, we cannot exclude a ν1/3 power law attenuated by synchrotron self-absorption.\"\n【63】 # X-rays\n【64】 NGC 383 is a double radio galaxy with a quasar-like appearance located in the constellation Pisces.  Recent discoveries by the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in 2006 reveal that NGC 383 is being bisected by high energy relativistic electrons traveling at relatively high fractions of the speed of light. These relativistic electrons are detected as synchrotron radiation in the x-ray and radio wavelengths. The focus of this intense energy is the galactic center of NGC 383. The relativistic electron jets detected as synchrotron radiation extend for several thousand parsecs and then appear to dissipate at the ends in the form of streamers or filaments.\n【65】 \"Inside  X-ray error box , a variable radio source VLA J070238.0+385044 was found that was similar to GRB 970508 (Taylor et al. 1998a, 1998b).\"\n【66】 # Blues\n【67】 The image at right shows the blue light, towards the lower right, due to synchrotron radiation, of a jet emerging from the bright active galactic nucleus (AGN) core of Messier 87.\n【68】 The image above shows a blue glow in the surrounding air from emitted cyclotron particulate radiation.\n【69】 At left is an image that shows the blue glow resulting from a beam of relativistic electrons as they slow down.

The radio emission is due to the synchrotron process. The observed structure in radio emission is determined by the interaction between twin jets and the external medium, modified by the effects of relativistic beaming. Radio-loud active galaxies are interesting not only in themselves, but also because they can be detected at large distances, making them valuable tools for observational cosmology. Recently, a good deal of work has been done on the effects of these objects on the intergalactic medium, particularly in galaxy groups and clusters.\"\n【78】 \"The radio emission from radio-loud active galaxies is synchrotron emission, as inferred from its very smooth, broad-band nature and strong polarization. This implies that the radio-emitting plasma contains, at least, electrons and magnetic fields. Since the plasma must be neutral, it must also contain either protons or positrons. There is no way of determining the particle content directly from observations of synchrotron radiation. Moreover, there is no way of determining the energy densities in particles and magnetic fields from observation (that is, the same synchrotron emissivity may be a result of a few electrons and a strong field, or a weak field and many electrons, or something in between). It is possible to determine a minimum energy condition which is the minimum energy density that a region with a given emissivity can have (Burbidge 1956), but for many years there was no particular reason to believe that the  true energies were anywhere near the minimum energies.\"\n【79】 \"A sister process to synchrotron radiation is the inverse-Compton process, in which the relativistic electrons interact with ambient photons and Thomson scatter them to high energies. Inverse-Compton emission from radio-loud sources turns out to be particularly important in X-rays (e.g. Croston et al. 2005) and, because it depends only on the density of electrons (and on the density of photons, which is known), a detection of inverse-Compton scattering allows a (somewhat model-dependent) estimate of the energy densities in the particles and magnetic fields. This has been used to argue that most sources are actually quite near the minimum-energy condition.\"\n【80】 \"Synchrotron radiation is not confined to radio wavelengths: if the radio source can accelerate particles to high enough energies, features which are detected in the radio may also be seen in the infrared, optical, ultraviolet or even X-ray, though in the latter case the electrons responsible must have energies in excess of 1 TeV in typical magnetic field strengths. Again, polarization and continuum spectrum  are used to distinguish synchrotron radiation from other emission processes. Jets and hotspots are the usual sources of high-frequency synchrotron emission. It is hard to distinguish observationally between synchrotron and inverse-Compton radiation, and there is ongoing disagreement about what processes we are seeing in some objects, particularly in the X-ray.\"\n【81】 \"The process(es) that produce the population of relativistic, non-thermal particles that give rise to synchrotron and inverse-Compton radiation are collectively known as particle acceleration. Fermi acceleration is one plausible particle acceleration process in radio-loud active galaxies.\"\n【82】 # Earth\n【83】 \"This composite picture  shows the radio sky above an old optical photograph of the NRAO site in Green Bank, WV.

Such stars quickly exhaust their nuclear fuel, collapse, and explode as supernovae, whose remnants appear as faint radio rings. Unlike the nearby (distances < 1000 light years) stars visible to the human eye, almost none of the myriad \"radio stars\" (unresolved radio sources) scattered across the sky are actually stars. Most are extremely luminous radio galaxies or quasars, and their average distance is over 5,000,000,000 light years. Radio waves travel at the speed of light, so distant extragalactic sources appear today as they actually were billions of years ago. Radio galaxies and quasars are beacons carrying information about galaxies and their environs, everywhere in the observable universe and ever since the first galaxies were formed.\"\n【85】 Electrons moving along a Birkeland current may be accelerated by a plasma double layer. If the resulting electrons approach relativistic velocities (i.e. if they approach the speed of light) they may subsequently produce a Bennett pinch, which in a magnetic field causes the electrons to spiral and emit synchrotron radiation that may include radio, optical (i.e. visible light), x-rays, and gamma rays.\n【86】 # Jupiter\n【87】 In 1955, Bernard Burke and Kenneth Franklin detected bursts of radio signals coming from Jupiter at 22.2 MHz. The period of these bursts matched the rotation of the planet, and they were also able to use this information to refine the rotation rate. Radio bursts from Jupiter were found to come in two forms: long bursts (or L-bursts) lasting up to several seconds, and short bursts (or S-bursts) that had a duration of less than a hundredth of a second.\n【88】 Between September and November 23, 1963, Jupiter is detected by radar astronomy.\n【89】 \"The dense atmosphere makes a penetration to a hard surface (if indeed one exists at all) very unlikely. In fact, the JPL results imply a correlation of the echo with Jupiter ... which corresponds to the upper (visible) atmosphere. ... Further observations will be needed to clarify the current uncertainties surrounding radar observations of Jupiter.\"\n【90】 \"Although in 1963 some claimed to have detected echoes from Jupiter, these were quite weak and have not been verified by later experiments.\"\n【91】 \"A search for radar echoes from Jupiter at 430 MHz during the oppositions of 1964 and 1965 failed to yield positive results, despite a sensitivity several orders of magnitude better than employed by other groups in earlier (1963) attempts at higher frequencies. ... t might be suspected that meteorological disturbances of a random nature were involved, and that the echoes might be returned only in exceptional circumstances. Further support for this point of view may be gleaned from the fact that JPL found positive results for only 1 (centered at 32° System I longitude) of the 8 longitude regions investigated in 1963 (Goldstein 1964) and, in fact, had no success during their observations in 1964 (see comment by Goldstein following Dyce 1965).\"\n【92】 # Interplanetary mediums\n【93】 Interplanetary scintillation refers to random fluctuations in the intensity of radio waves of celestial origin, on the timescale of a few seconds. It is analogous to the twinkling one sees looking at stars in the sky at night, but in the radio part of the electromagnetic spectrum rather than the visible one. Interplanetary scintillation is the result of radio waves traveling through fluctuations in the density of the electron and protons that make up the solar wind.\n【94】 Scintillation occurs as a result of variations in the refractive index of the medium through which waves are traveling. The solar wind is a plasma, composed primarily of electrons and lone protons, and the variations in the index of refraction are caused by variations in the density of the plasma. Different indices of refraction result in phase changes between waves traveling through different locations, which results in interference. As the waves interfere, both the frequency of the wave and its angular size are broadened, and the intensity varies.\n【95】 # Interstellar medium\n【96】 Radio astronomy has resulted in the detection of over a hundred interstellar species, including radicals and ions, and organic (i.e. carbon-based) compounds, such as alcohols, acids, aldehydes, and ketones. One of the most abundant interstellar molecules, and among the easiest to detect with radio waves (due to its strong electric dipole moment), is CO (carbon monoxide). In fact, CO is such a common interstellar molecule that it is used to map out molecular regions. The radio observation of perhaps greatest human interest is the claim of interstellar glycine, the simplest amino acid, but with considerable accompanying controversy. One of the reasons why this detection  controversial is that although radio (and some other methods like rotational spectroscopy) are good for the identification of simple species with large dipole moments, they are less sensitive to more complex molecules, even something relatively small like amino acids.\n【97】 \"Interstellar gas in our Galaxy  emits spectral lines as well as continuum noise. Neutral hydrogen (HI) gas is ubiquitous in the disk. The brightness of the λ ~ 21 cm hyperfine line at ~ 1420.4 MHz is proportional to the column density of HI along the line of sight and is nearly independent of the gas temperature. It is not affected by dust absorption, so we can see the HI throughout our Galaxy and nearby external galaxies.\"\n【98】 \"Red indicates directions of high HI column density, while blue and black show areas with little hydrogen. The figure is centered on the Galactic center and Galactic longitude increases to the left. Some of the hydrogen loops outline old supernova remnants.\"\n【99】 # Milky Way\n【100】 \"The cosmic static discovered by Karl Jansky is dominated by diffuse emission orginating in and near the disk of our Galaxy. The distribution of 408 MHz continuum emission shown  in Galactic coordinates is expected since we are located in the disk of a galaxy similar to the edge-on galaxy NGC 4565\".\n【101】 \"This all-sky 408 MHz continuum image  is shown in Galactic coordinates, with the galactic center in the middle and the galactic disk extending horizontally from it.\"\n【102】 # Galaxies\n【103】 The hotspots that are usually seen in FRII sources are interpreted as being the visible manifestations of shocks formed when the fast, and therefore supersonic, jet (the  speed of sound cannot exceed c/√3) abruptly terminates at the end of the source, and their spectral energy distributions are consistent with this picture.\n【104】 \"Radio galaxies (and, to a lesser extent, radio-loud quasars) display a wide range of structures in radio maps. The most common large-scale structures are called lobes: these are double, often fairly symmetrical, roughly ellipsoidal structures placed on either side of the active nucleus. A significant minority of low-luminosity sources exhibit structures usually known as plumes which are much more elongated. Some radio galaxies show one or two long narrow features known as jets (the most famous example being the giant galaxy M87 in the Virgo cluster) coming directly from the nucleus and going to the lobes. Since the 1970s (Scheuer 1974, Blandford & Rees 1974) the most widely accepted model has been that the lobes or plumes are powered by beams of high-energy particles and magnetic field coming from close to the active nucleus. The jets are believed to be the visible manifestations of the beams, and often the term jet is used to refer both to the observable feature and to the underlying flow.\"\n【105】 \"Radio sources were divided by Fanaroff & Riley (1974) into two classes, now known as Fanaroff and Riley Class I (FRI), and Class II (FRII). The distinction was originally made based on the morphology of the large-scale radio emission (the type was determined by the distance between the brightest points in the radio emission): FRI sources were brightest towards the centre, while FRII sources were brightest at the edges. Fanaroff & Riley observed that there was a reasonably sharp divide in luminosity between the two classes: FRIs were low-luminosity, FRIIs were high luminosity. With more detailed radio observations, the morphology turns out to reflect the method of energy transport in the radio source. FRI objects typically have bright jets in the centre, while FRIIs have faint jets but bright hotspots at the ends of the lobes. FRIIs appear to be able to transport energy efficiently to the ends of the lobes, while FRI beams are inefficient in the sense that they radiate a significant amount of their energy away as they travel.\"\n【106】 \"In more detail, the FRI/FRII division depends on host-galaxy environment (Owen & Ledlow 1994) in the sense that the FRI/FRII transition appears at higher luminosities in more massive galaxies. FRI jets are known to be decelerating in the regions in which their radio emission is brightest (e.g. Laing & Bridle 2002) and so it seems that the FRI/FRII transition reflects whether a jet/beam can propagate through the host galaxy without being decelerated to sub-relativistic speeds by interaction with the intergalactic medium. From analysis of relativistic beaming effects, the jets of FRII sources are known to remain relativistic (with speeds of at least 0.5c) out to the ends of the lobes. The hotspots that are usually seen in FRII sources are interpreted as being the visible manifestations of shock]s formed when the fast, and therefore supersonic, jet (the  speed of sound cannot exceed c/√3) abruptly terminates at the end of the source, and their spectral energy distributions are consistent with this picture (Meisenheimer et al. 1989). Often multiple hotspots are seen, reflecting either continued outflow after the shock or movement of the jet termination point: the overall hotspot region is sometimes called the hotspot complex.\"\n【107】 \"Names are given to several particular types of radio source based on their radio structure:\"\n【108】 - Classical double refers to an FRII source with clear hotspots.\n【109】 - Wide-angle tail normally refers to a source intermediate between standard FRI and FRII structure, with efficient jets and sometimes hotspots, but with plumes rather than lobes, found at or near the centres of clusters.\n【110】 - Narrow-angle tail or Head-tail source describes an FRI that appears to be bent by ram pressure as it moves through a cluster.\n【111】 - Fat doubles are sources with diffuse lobes but neither jets nor hotspots. Some such sources may be relics whose energy supply has been permanently or temporarily turned off.\n【112】 # Radiation astromathematics\n【113】 Ions accelerating past each other at relativistic speeds generate synchrotron radiation. Depending on the ion concentration, this radiation may contribute significantly to stellar spectra as may cyclotron or bremsstrahlung radiation from similar ion and electron interactions at slower speeds.\n【114】 # 3C 48\n【115】 3C48 is a quasar discovered in 1960; it was the second source conclusively identified as such.\n【116】 3C48 was the first source in the Third Cambridge Catalogue of Radio Sources for which an optical identification was found in 1960 through interferometry.\n【117】 It had a redshift of 0.367, making it one of the highest redshift sources then known.\n【118】 It was not until 1982 that the surrounding faint galactic \"nebulosity\" was confirmed to have the same redshift as 3C48, cementing its identification as an object in a distant galaxy.  This was also the first solid identification of a quasar with a surrounding galaxy at the same redshift.\n【119】 3C 48 is one of four primary calibrators used by the Very Large Array (along with 3C 138, 3C 147, and 3C 286). Visibilities of all other sources are calibrated using observed visibilities of one of these four calibrators.\n【120】 # 3C 66A\n【121】 In particular, the innermost two jet components of two TeV-emitting BL Lacs in our sample: 0219+428 (3C 66A)  and 1219+285 (W Comae) are both inward-moving. The small velocities and core separations of these moving components may indicate that the core is not a stable reference point in these two jets.\"\n【122】 # 3C 75\n【123】 3C 75 may be X-ray source 2A 0252+060 (1H 0253+058, XRS 02522+060).\n【124】 \"What's happening at the center of active galaxy 3C 75? The two bright sources at the center of this composite x-ray (blue)/ radio (pink) image are co-orbiting supermassive black holes powering the giant radio source 3C 75. Surrounded by multimillion degree x-ray emitting gas, and blasting out jets of relativistic particles the supermassive black holes are separated by 25,000 light-years. At the cores of two merging galaxies in the Abell 400 galaxy cluster they are some 300 million light-years away.\"\n【125】 # 3C 111\n【126】 \"VLBA images of the jet in the broad-line radio galaxy 3C 111. The picture shows the variable parsec-scale structure of the jet in this active galactic nucleus. The features observed correspond to ejected plasma regions traveling at relativistic speeds. Those appear to be larger than the speed of light due to projection effects. The sixteen images are spaced by their relative time intervals. The images show that a major radio flux-density outburst in 1996 was followed by a particularly bright plasma ejection associated with a superluminal jet component. This major event was followed by trailing features in its evolution. A similar event is seen after mid 2001. The jet dynamics in this source is revealed: a plasma injection into the jet beam leads to the formation of multiple shocks that travel at different speeds downstream (ranging from 3c to 6c) and interact with each other and with the ambient medium. This is in agreement with numerical relativistic magnetohydrodynamic structural and emission simulations of jets.\"\n【127】 \"Images were taken at 15 GHz with the full Very Long Baseline Array as part of the 2cm Survey/MOJAVE collaboration. The observing runs usually last 8 hr and the total observing time on source is approximately 50 minutes. The typical dynamic range in the images is of 1000:1 (the lowest shown flux density is typically of 1-2 mJy/beam). The images are convolved with a common restoring beam of 0.5x1.0 milliarcseconds (P.A. of 0 deg). The image alignment is (arbitrary) to the brightness peak. The superluminal speeds of the features in the jet were determined from a detailed analysis of multiple Gaussian model fits to the observed visibilities.\"\n【128】 # 3C 123\n【129】 3C 123 is a strong radio source. It is surrounded by three other, even weaker galaxies.\n【130】 The initial estimation of the Doppler shift (z = 0.637) indicated that it is the furthest-known (then mid-70s) galaxy, located within 8 billion light years, 5 to 10 times the size of our Galaxy, and as a radio source about 4 times stronger than Cygnus A\n【131】 . Subsequent investigations clarified the value of about 0.218, that is, the galaxy is much closer to the Earth and is not as large as previously thought.\n【132】 # 3C 273\n【133】 The first quasars (3C 48 and 3C 273) were discovered in the late 1950s, as radio sources in all-sky radio surveys. With small telescopes and the Lovell Telescope as an interferometer, they were shown to have a very small angular size.\n【134】 Measurements taken during one of the occultations by the Moon using the Parkes Radio Telescope allowed a visible counterpart to the radio source to be found and an optical spectrum using the 200-inch Hale Telescope on Mount Palomar to be obtained which revealed the same strange emission lines that were likely ordinary spectral lines of hydrogen redshifted by 15.8 percent - an extreme redshift never seen in astronomy before such that if this was due to the physical motion of the \"star\", then 3C 273 was receding at an enormous velocity, around 47,000 km/s, far beyond the speed of any known star and defying any obvious explanation.\n【135】 “Maps of the radio structure of the quasar 3C273 provide evidence of a superluminal expansion during the period 1977-1980. The superluminal expansion might be attributed to the movement of a single knot away from the nucleus along the jet. The apparent constant velocity of 10 times the speed of light is an important constraint on theories of apparent superluminal expansion.”\n【136】 # 3C 279\n【137】 \"Superluminal motion in quasar 3C279 is shown  in a \"movie\" mosaic of five radio images made over seven years. The stationary core is the bright red spot to the left of each image. The observed location of the rightmost blue-green blob moved about 25 light years from 1991 to 1998, hence the changes appear to an observer to be faster than the speed of light or \"superluminal\". The motion is not really faster than light, the measured speed is due to light-travel-time effects for a source moving near the speed of light almost directly toward the observer. The blue-green blob is part of a jet pointing within 2 degrees to our line of sight, and moving at a true speed of 0.997 times the speed of light. These five images are part of a larger set of twenty-eight images made with the VLBA and other radio telescopes from 1991 to 1997 to study the detailed properties of this energetic quasar.\" The images are in the K band, 1.2 cm, 22 GHz.\n【138】 # 3C 295\n【139】 3C 295 is a strongly X-ray emitting galaxy cluster in the constellation Boötes. 3C 295 (Cl 1409+524) is one of the most distant galaxy clusters observed by X-ray telescopes.

The paths are not always radial to the nucleus, usually taken as the source with the flattest spectrum in ambiguous cases. This is based on the general principle that synchrotron spectra are flattened at lower frequencies by self-absorption, so the densest plasma will have a flat or inverted spectrum. An interesting case is 3C 345 , in which emission features repeatedly appear off the core and follow fairly consistent nonradial paths.  a new component appears in late 1985, brightens, and moves outward changing its relative position angle in the process\".\n【142】 \"VLBI (very-long-baseline interferometry) observations between 1971 and 1983 have been used to determine the positions of the 'core' of the quasar 3C345 relative to the more distant compact quasar NRAO512 with a fractional uncertainty as small as two parts in a hundred million. The core of 3C345 appears stationary in right ascension to within 20 arc microsec/yr, a subluminal bound corresponding to 0.7c.

This change was accompanied by an apparent deceleration by almost 50%. Between 1988.4 and 1990.8 A apparently accelerated again but its brightness barely changed and by 1990.8 its brightness peak had shifted back to its \"standard\" P.A. and continued in this direction through 1992.7 and 1993.4 with no significant changes in the velocity and only a slight decrease in flux density. The apparent acceleration from ≃  at a few pc to ≃  at  is similar to that seen in the best-studied superluminal source 3C 345\".\n【149】 There \"are gross changes in the brightness structure of the jet taking place very quickly.

It is a double source, contains an active galactic nucleus and a supermassive black hole at the core with a mass of 7039497137500000000♠(2.5±0.7)×109 M☉.\n【154】 Radio images show two jets protruding in opposite directions from the galaxy's center, extending many times the width of the portion of the host galaxy which emits radiation in the visible. At the ends of the jets are two lobes with \"hot spots\" of more intense radiation at their edges, formed when material from the jets collides with the surrounding intergalactic medium.\n【155】 In 2016, a radio transient was discovered 460 parsecs away from the center of Cygnus A, between 1989 and 2016, the object, cospatial with a previously-known infrared source, exhibited at least an eightfold increase in radio flux density, with comparable luminosity to the brightest known supernova, but, the rate of brightening is unknown, the object has remained at a relatively constant flux density since its discovery, consistent with a second supermassive black hole orbiting the primary object, with the secondary having undergone a rapid accretion rate increase, where the inferred orbital timescale is of the same order as the activity of the primary source, suggesting the secondary may be perturbing the primary and causing the outflows.\n【156】 \"Many objects with jets, especially the powerful FR II radio sources with long and highly collimated jets, show hot spots - compact enhancements in brightness of the lobes. Cygnus A  is a prime example. These may in turn have internal structure, and often have the flattest spectra (thus most energetic particle populations) in the extended lobes. They have been pictures as encounter surfaces between the jet flows and a mostly unseen surrounding medium, with compression of the magnetic field occurring and thus vastly increased emissivity. Some (such as Pictor A) have such high-energy electron populations that sychrotron emission continues through the optical into the X-ray regime.\"\n【157】 Cygnus A \"is the most powerful radio galaxy on our corner of the Universe, used as a point of departure for studying radio galaxies at great distances. At a redshift z=0.0565 (distance of about 211 Mpc or 700 million light-years), its nature remains mysterious enough. The first photographs of Cygnus A showed two clumps of luminous material, which led  that the radio emission was somehow linked to a galaxy collision.  a poorly resolved version of Centaurus A, bisected by a thick dust lane. The HST image shown as an inset  reveals much detail, but doesn't quite clear the matter up. We see dust and an odd Z-shaped pattern. Much of this light in some regions comes not from stars, but from gas ionized by the nucleus. This is a narrow-line radio galaxy, but infrared and polarization measurements show that from some directions it would appear as a broad-line object and perhaps as a quasar, so that there is plenty of radiation in some directions to light up the gas.\"\n【158】 \"Cygnus A is an excellent example of the Fanaroff-Riley (FR) type II radio sources, characterized by faint, very narrow jets, distinct lobes, and clear hot spots at the outer edges of the lobes, often where the jets intersect the outer edges. These are in general more powerful radio sources than the FR I objects , with the difference being frequently attributed to faster (relativistic?) motion of the jet material in the stronger FR II sources. The radio/optical overlay highlights the extent of the radio source beyond the central galaxy, extending 140 kpc (500,000 light-years) if we see it sideways.\"\n【159】 # 3C 459\n【160】 \"The spectral index distribution between 408 and 4885 MHz  made by convolving the VLA image to a resolution of 0.62 arcsec.\"\n【161】 Radio galaxy 3C459 \"has a very asymmetric radio structure, a high infrared luminosity and a young stellar population. The eastern component of the double-lobed structure is brighter, much closer to the nucleus and is significantly less polarized than the western one. This is consistent with the jet on the eastern side interacting with dense gas, which could be due to a merged companion or dense cloud of gas.\"\n【162】 The \"radio structure of the source comprises a core and two extended lobes, the eastern one being a factor of ∼5 closer to the core than the western lobe and the whole source extending to approximately 8.2 arcsec. This corresponds to a linear size of 19.5 kpc, which is similar to other compact steep-spectrum objects. At the VLA resolution of ∼0.4 arcsec at λ6 cm, the eastern lobe, though significantly resolved, appears to have a smooth structure with no discernible small-scale features. The western lobe, extending half-way back to the core has a tail with two peaks of emission. The higher-resolution λ2 cm image of U85 shows the source to have an edge-brightened, FRII structure, consistent with its radio luminosity of 2.1 × 1025 W Hz−1 sr−1 at 1400 MHz. It is worth noting that the central component, which contributes ∼30 per cent of the total flux density at 5 GHz, has a steep radio spectrum with a spectral index, α (S∝ να), of −0.78±0.15 between λ6 and 2 cm (U85). 3C459 also exhibits a high degree of polarization asymmetry between the two lobes (Davis, Stannard & Conway 1983; U85; Morganti et al. 1999). It has an integrated rotation measure of −6±1 rad m−2 with an intrinsic position angle (PA) of 7±3° (Simard-Normandin, Kronberg & Button 1981).\"\n【163】 # NGC 315\n【164】 The image at right is of apparent superluminal motion in NGC 315. In both of these images the apparent motion is rectilinear or close to it. NGC 315 is a low-luminosity radio galaxy.\n【165】 # NGC 1068\n【166】 \"Measurements of the polarization of the light near the nucleus of NGC 1068, a nearby and prototypical type 2 Seyfert, provided strong evidence that it actually contains a type 1 nucleus which is blocked from our direct view by an obscuring ring or torus of material. The nucleus produces a radio jet at right angles to this hypothesized torus, which must lie almost at right angles to the galaxy's disk plane. Recent VLBI observations may have detected this torus, as shown in this montage. HST images are used to show the galaxy as a whole and the conelike illumination pattern of highly ionized gas which must see the nucleus directly, then the radio jet and finally a tiny structure which has the right size, orientation, and temperature to be the obscuring disk. If this in fact the obscuring material, this is an important piece of evidence for the unified scheme for Seyfert galaxies. This is simply the notion that many type 2 Seyferts would be type 1 objects if we could see them from the proper direction, nearly along the axis of the torus so that our view is not blocked. These special directions are often marked by both radio jets and cones of intense radiation, which we see either as they ionize ambient gas or are reflected from clouds rich in dust that happen to lie within the cones.\"\n【167】 # NGC 1316\n【168】 \"This image  was made from a single beam  observation of NGC 1316 (Fornax A).

Situated at the Murchison Radioastronomy Observatory, ASKAP has almost no radio frequency interference in this band and very little flagging was required. The bandpass was calibrated using an observation of PKS B1934-638, but no other calibration method has been used. The data were de-convolved using a combination of Hogbom CLEAN and the maximum entropy method. No Taylor terms were used, but some W-terms were required due to the large primary beam size (nearly 2 degrees in diameter). This image contains all of ASKAP’s longest and shortest baselines, making the synthesised beam size 12”x10”. The noise in the background of the image has an RMS of 25 uJy/beam, which is close to the thermal expectation for robust zero weighting.​\"\n【169】 \"The radio galaxy Fornax A is one of the brightest in the sky and has the advantage of being much closer to our own galaxy the Milky Way. If we could see Fornax A in the sky with our naked eyes then each of its two lobes would be about the same size as a full moon. It is close enough that ASKAP can resolve extended structure, demonstrating the telescope’s ability to detect diffuse emission as well as compact objects. Furthermore, as each of the 36 available ASKAP beams can see a region of sky that is about 4 full-moon-spans across, the source can be easily observed within a single beam. Observations of the source had been requested by our international science teams and the CASS commissioning team decided it would be a good target for our single-beam demonstration.\"\n【170】 # NGC 4151\n【171】 \"Seyfert galaxies were originally noted for the strength and broadening of their emission lines, and as a class were later characterized by the high ionization states of many of the atomic and ionized species producing these lines.

It uses spectra taken with apertures several arcseconds in size, so as to reproduce the usual spectrum mixing broad and narrow-line components. From 912-1800 A, the data come from the Shuttle-borne Hopkins Ultraviolet Telescope; from 1800-3200 A, from the mean of three measurements by the International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) taken at similar brightness levels; from 3200-4000A, from an observation at Kitt Peak National Observatory, with the continuum rescaled to match the adjacent spectra; from 4000-8000 A, a CCD observation obtained at the Lick Observatory 3-m Shane telescope by Alexei Filippenko; from 8000 A to 1 microns, an observation using the same telescope by Donald Osterbrock and collaborators, carefully corrected for atmospheric absorption; from 0.9-2.4 microns, measurements by Rodger Thompson at Steward Observatory's 2,3-m Bok telescope, and on into the infrared, from the Infrared Space Observatory provided by Eckhard Sturm.

The strongest of these are the hydrogen recombination lines, such as Lyman alpha at 1216 A, H-beta at 4861, and H-alpha at 6563, plus the strong ultraviolet lines of C IV at 1549 and Mg II at 2800. Other features produced only by very rarefied gas at densities of 1000 atoms per cubic centimeter or so - the forbidden lines, denoted by brackets - arise in regions with less velocity structure and are narrower. Some strong examples are  at 4959 and 5007 A,  at 3727,  at 3426, and  at 9060 and 9532.\"\n【173】 \"The spectra of active galactic nuclei are noteworthy in showing species with a large range in ionization at once, from neutral ions such as  and  to highly ionized cases such as  and . Even hot stars such as light up gaseous nebulae in our galaxy cannot ionize gas as highly as these ions require, so that both a strong source of hard radiation and a wide range in gas density must be present to see such spectra.\"\n【174】 \"NGC 4151 is a bit unusual in showing strong absorption in several lines, especially Lyman alpha and C IV. The absorption is blueshifted with respect to the line centers, so that it arises in some kind of wind or other gaseous outflow.\"\n【175】 # NGC 5846\n【176】 NGC 5846 is the foremost galaxy of the large galaxy group known as the NGC 5846 group which includes NGC 5813, NGC 5831, NGC 5845, and NGC 5854. The group has two subgroups, one centered around the elliptical NGC 5813 and the other around NGC 5846, lying at a projected separation of 600 kpc. The group is part of the Virgo III Groups, a very obvious chain of galaxy groups on the left side of the Virgo cluster, stretching across 40 million light years of space.\n【177】 In the image on the left of NGC 5846, white crosses mark the detected CO cloud positions.\n【178】 The galaxy has complex X-ray morphology that is considered to be the result of AGN outflows. Two inner bubbles in the hot gas, at a distance of 600 pc from the center and filled with radio emission, are clear indications of recent AGN feedback. A weak radio source, elongated in the NE–SW direction, connects the inner cavities. X-ray-bright rims surround the inner X-ray bubbles. Many X-ray knots are visible, suggesting cooling sites. The scenario indicated by the Chandra observation is that of an AGN outflow, compressing and cooling the gas in the central ~2 kpc (20\" at the distance of NGC 5846).\n【179】 \"A beautiful new image of two colliding galaxies  has been released by NASA's Great Observatories. The Antennae galaxies, located about 62 million light-years from Earth, are shown in this composite image from the Chandra X-ray Observatory (blue), the Hubble Space Telescope (gold and brown), and the Spitzer Space Telescope (red). The Antennae galaxies take their name from the long antenna-like \"arms,\" seen in wide-angle views of the system. These features were produced by tidal forces generated in the collision.\"\n【180】 \"The collision, which began more than 100 million years ago and is still occurring, has triggered the formation of millions of stars in clouds of dust and gas in the galaxies. The most massive of these young stars have already sped through their evolution in a few million years and exploded as supernovas.\"\n【181】 \"The X-ray image from Chandra shows huge clouds of hot, interstellar gas that have been injected with rich deposits of elements from supernova explosions. This enriched gas, which includes elements such as oxygen, iron, magnesium, and silicon, will be incorporated into new generations of stars and planets. The bright, point-like sources in the image are produced by material falling onto black holes and neutron stars that are remnants of the massive stars. Some of these black holes may have masses that are almost one hundred times that of the Sun.\"\n【182】 \"The Spitzer data show infrared light from warm dust clouds that have been heated by newborn stars, with the brightest clouds lying in the overlapping region between the two galaxies.\"\n【183】 \"The Hubble data reveal old stars and star-forming regions in gold and white, while filaments of dust appear in brown. Many of the fainter objects in the optical image are clusters containing thousands of stars.\"\n【184】 \"The Chandra image was taken in December 1999. The Spitzer image was taken in December 2003.

The object has started sending out radio waves, and the emission does not look like anything seen anywhere in the universe before.\n【191】 There have been several theories about the nature of this unknown object, but currently no theory entirely fits the observed data. It has been suggested that the object could be a \"micro quasar\", having very high radio luminosity yet low X-ray luminosity, and being fairly stable. However, all known microquasars produce large quantities of X-rays, whereas the object's X-ray flux is below the measurement threshold. The object is located at several arcseconds from the center of M82. It has an apparent superluminal motion of 4 times the speed of light relative to the galaxy center.\n【192】 # S4 0003+38\n【193】 At right is a radio image of quasar S4 0003+38.

The Kölner Observatorium für SubMillimeter Astronomie (KOSMA)  is a 3-m radio telescope located at 3,135 m on Gornergrat near Zermatt (Switzerland) in the southern tower (nearest to the camera).\n【197】 \"Because of the good climatic conditions at the altitude of 3135 m (10285 ft), astronomical observatories have been located in both towers of the “Kulmhotel” at Gornergrat since 1967. In 1985, the KOSMA telescope was installed in the southern tower by the Universität zu Köln and, in the course of 1995, replaced by a new dish and mount.\"\n【198】 \"The KOSMA telescope with its receivers and spectrometers was dedicated to observe interstellar and atmospheric molecular lines in the millimeter and submillimeter wavelength range. After 25 years of a successful era came to an end (June 2nd, 2010). The 3m KOSMA Radio Telescope left the Gornergrat and joined his long journey to Yangbajing / Lhasa / Tibet.\"\n【199】 \"Chinese and German scientists are establishing an astronomical observatory in a Tibetan county 4,300 meters above sea level.\"\n【200】 \"Tibet is an ideal location because the water deficit in its air ensures superb atmospheric transparency and creates a comparatively stable environment for research in the areas of astrophysics, high-energy and atmospheric physics.\"\n【201】 \"The observatory would house a KOSMA 3-meter sub-millimeter-wave telescope, the first of its kind to be used in general astronomical observation in China.\"\n【202】 # Radio observatories\n【203】 The \"Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico  the world's largest, and most sensitive, single-dish radio telescope.\"\n【204】 \"The 1,000-foot-diameter (305 meters) Arecibo telescope  access to state-of-the-art observing for scientists in radio astronomy, solar system radar and atmospheric studies, and the observatory has the unique capability for solar system and ionosphere (the atmosphere's ionized upper layers) radar remote sensing.\"\n【205】 \"It contains the largest curved focusing dish on Earth, giving Arecibo the largest electromagnetic-wave-gathering capacity. The dish surface is made of 38,778 perforated aluminum panels, each measuring about 3 by 6 feet (1 by 2 m), supported by a mesh of steel cables.\n【206】 The telescope has three radar transmitters, with effective isotropic radiated powers of 20 TW at 2380 MHz, 2.5 TW (pulse peak) at 430 MHz, and 300 MW at 47 MHz. The telescope is a spherical reflector, not a parabolic reflector. To aim the telescope, the receiver is moved to intercept signals reflected from different directions by the spherical dish surface. A parabolic mirror would induce a varying astigmatism when the receiver is in different positions off the focal point, but the error of a spherical mirror is the same in every direction.\n【207】 The receiver is located on a 900-ton platform which is suspended 150 m (500 ft) in the air above the dish by 18 cables running from three reinforced concrete towers, one of which is 110 m (365 ft) high and the other two of which are 80 m (265 ft) high (the tops of the three towers are at the same elevation). The platform has a 93-meter-long rotating bow-shaped track called the azimuth arm on which receiving antennas, secondary and tertiary reflectors are mounted. This allows the telescope to observe any region of the sky within a forty-degree cone of visibility about the local zenith (between −1 and 38 degrees of declination). Puerto Rico's location near the equator allows Arecibo to view all of the planets in the Solar System, though the round trip light time to objects beyond Saturn is longer than the time the telescope can track it, preventing radar observations of more distant objects.\n【208】 # Hypotheses\n【209】 - Synchrotron radiation is prevalent from many astronomical sources.\n【210】 # Acknowledgements\n【211】 The content on this page was first contributed by: Henry A.

The range extends from Morocco and Spain north to southern France, Italy and Croatia, and east to Greece and northern Libya, with an outlying population (from which it was first described) in Syria (including Aleppo), Jordan and Israel. It is generally found at low altitudes, mostly from sea level to 200 m, but can grow at an altitude of up to 1000 m in southern Spain, and up to 1700 m in the south, in Morocco and Algeria.\n【2】 It is a small to medium-size tree, reaching 15-25 m tall and with a trunk diameter of up to 60 cm, exceptionally up to 1 m. The bark is orange-red, thick and deeply fissured at the base of the trunk, and thin and flaky in the upper crown. The leaves (\"needles\") are very slender, 6-12 cm long, distinctly yellowish green and produced in pairs (rarely a few in threes). The cones are narrow conic, 5-12 cm long and 2-3 cm broad at the base when closed, green at first, ripening glossy red-brown when 24 months old. They open slowly over the next few years, a process quickened if they are exposed to heat such as in forest fires. The cones open 5-8 cm wide to allow the seeds to disperse. The seeds are 5-6 mm long, with a 20 mm wing, and are wind-dispersed.\n【3】 Aleppo Pine is closely related to the Turkish Pine, Canary Island Pine and Maritime Pine which all share many of its characteristics. Some authors include the Turkish Pine as a subspecies of the Aleppo Pine, as Pinus halepensis subsp. brutia (Ten.) Holmboe, but it is usually regarded as a distinct species. It is a relatively non-variable species, with its morphological characteristics staying constant over the entire range.\n【4】 It is widely planted for timber in its native area, being one of the most important trees in forestry in Algeria and Morocco. It is also a popular ornamental tree, extensively planted in parks and gardens in hot dry areas such as southern California, where its considerable heat and drought tolerance is highly valued. However, the tree is also considered a feral weed on South Australia's Eyre Peninsula, where an eradication program is in place.\n【5】 The resin of the Aleppo Pine is used to flavor the Greek wine retsina.\n【6】 # In art\n【7】 Paul Cézanne had an Aleppo Pine in his garden at Aix-en-Provence; this tree was the inspiration and model for his painting, The Big Trees.

It is recommended only if the company provides lenalidomide according to the commercial arrangement.\n【4】 People currently receiving lenalidomide for the treatment of multiple myeloma, but who have not received 2 or more prior therapies, should have the option to continue therapy until they and their clinicians consider it appropriate to stop.# The technology \n【5】 Lenalidomide (Revlimid, Celgene) is an immunomodulating agent. It belongs to a class of agents often referred to as immunomodulatory derivatives, which are all structural derivatives of thalidomide. The exact mechanism of action of lenalidomide is not understood but it has anti-neoplastic, anti-angiogenic and pro-erythropoietic properties. Lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone is licensed for the treatment of multiple myeloma in patients who have received at least one prior therapy. The recommended starting dose of lenalidomide for adults over 18 years is 25 mg orally once daily on days 1 to 21 of repeated 28-day cycles. Treatment with lenalidomide is continued until disease progression or unacceptable adverse effects occur. For full details, see the summary of product characteristics.\n【6】 The most serious adverse effects of lenalidomide treatment are grade 4 neutropenia and venous thromboembolism. The most frequently observed adverse effects, which occurred significantly more frequently in the lenalidomide/dexamethasone group compared with the placebo/dexamethasone group in clinical trials (see section 3), were neutropenia, fatigue, asthenia, constipation, muscle cramp, thrombocytopenia, anaemia, diarrhoea and rash. Lenalidomide is structurally related to thalidomide and there is a risk of teratogenesis. Pregnancy must be ruled out before starting treatment in women of child-bearing age, and these women must use effective contraception while on lenalidomide. For full details of adverse effects and contraindications, see the summary of product characteristics.\n【7】 Lenalidomide 25 mg capsules cost £4368 per 21 capsules (excluding VAT; 'British national formulary'  edition 55). Dosage is continued or modified based upon clinical and laboratory findings. For example, if lenalidomide is continued for ten 28-day cycles without dose reduction, the cost would be £43,680. The pricing arrangement considered during guidance development was that the manufacturer (Celgene) had agreed a complex patient access scheme with the Department of Health, in which the cost of lenalidomide for people who remain on treatment for more than 26 cycles would be met by the manufacturer. A commercial arrangement has now been agreed. This makes lenalidomide available to the NHS with a discount. The size of the discount is commercial in confidence. It is the manufacturer's responsibility to let relevant NHS organisations know details of the discount.# The manufacturer's submission\n【8】 The Appraisal Committee (appendix A) considered evidence submitted by the manufacturer of lenalidomide and a review of this submission by the Evidence Review Group (ERG; appendix B).\n【9】 The manufacturer produced an analysis of the clinical and cost effectiveness of lenalidomide for the treatment of multiple myeloma in people who had received at least one prior therapy. This included people at first and subsequent relapse and people who had progressive disease after two or more cycles of anti-myeloma treatment. The trial population was divided into five subgroups for the economic analysis. For people who had received only one prior therapy the main comparator was bortezomib monotherapy, which is currently recommended as a treatment option in 'Bortezomib monotherapy for relapsed multiple myeloma' (NICE technology appraisal guidance 129). For people in whom bortezomib was contraindicated, people who had received two or more prior therapies and people who had received prior thalidomide (only one prior therapy or two or more prior therapies), the comparator was dexamethasone.\n【10】 Two randomised controlled trials (RCTs), of identical design but differing in their locations (MM-009 and MM-010), compared treatment with lenalidomide plus dexamethasone (len/dex) with dexamethasone alone for patients with multiple myeloma who had received at least one prior therapy. In both arms, the regimen of dexamethasone was pulsed high-dose dexamethasone in 28-day cycles. The trials enrolled 353 and 351 patients, respectively (n = 704). Patients were stratified according to their serum concentration of β2-microglobulin, previous stem-cell transplantation and number of previous anti-myeloma therapies. Treatment was continued until the disease progressed or unacceptable adverse effects occurred. The primary outcome was time to progression (TTP). Secondary outcomes were overall survival, response rates, adverse effects and time to decrease in performance status. Response was assessed using the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation criteria, and six response categories were defined: complete response, near-complete response, partial response, stable disease, disease progression and 'response not evaluable'. A number of post-hoc subgroups from the pooled populations were investigated, including patients with pre-existing peripheral neuropathy and patients who had received prior thalidomide or bortezomib therapy. At disease progression or unblinding, patients in the dexamethasone monotherapy group were allowed to receive lenalidomide.\n【11】 The median TTP at unblinding from the pooled trials was 48.3 weeks (95% confidence interval  41.1 to 60.1 weeks) for the len/dex arms and 20.1 weeks (95% CI 19.9 to 20.7 weeks) for the dexamethasone arms. The pooled hazard ratio for TTP was 0.35 (95% CI 0.29 to 0.43; log-rank p < 0.001). The median overall survival in one trial, analysed 3 years and 3 months after study initiation, was 29.6 months in the len/dex arm and 20.2 months in the dexamethasone arm (hazard ratio 0.44; 95% CI 0.30 to 0.65; p < 0.001). In the second trial, the median overall survival was analysed 2 years and 8 months after study initiation; it could not be estimated in the len/dex arm (because of the number of patients still alive), and was 20.6 months in the dexamethasone arm (hazard ratio 0.66; 95% CI 0.45 to 0.96; p = 0.03). For the pooled trials, the subgroup of patients who had received one prior therapy had a median survival of 169.1 weeks in the len/dex arm compared with 145.4 weeks in the dexamethasone arm. For the subgroup of patients who had received two or more prior therapies, the median survival was 144.0 weeks in the len/dex arm compared with 118.0 weeks in the dexamethasone arm. A complete, near-complete or partial response was obtained in 60.6% of patients in the len/dex arms and 21.9% of patients in the dexamethasone arms. The remaining 39.4% of patients in the len/dex arms and 78.1% of patients in the dexamethasone arms had stable or progressive disease, or were not evaluable. The odds ratio for this dichotomised response (complete, near-complete or partial response versus stable disease, progressive disease or response not evaluable) was 5.48 (95% CI 3.94 to 7.63; p < 0.001). Over the course of the first 23 cycles in the trial, about 70% of the treatment days for all patients in the trial were at the full dose of lenalidomide. The dose of lenalidomide was reduced on about 25% of the treatment days, and treatment was interrupted on about 5% of the days.\n【12】 The results for overall survival were affected by crossover of patients at unblinding: 170 of 351 patients in the dexamethasone arm opted to receive lenalidomide at disease progression or unblinding. However, these patients were analysed as remaining in the dexamethasone arm. The TTP was also affected by the crossover, but to a lesser degree because most patients (over 75%) had shown disease progression at unblinding.\n【13】 In both trials, the differences in TTP and response rates (in favour of len/dex) were observed in all of the prespecified subgroups. The post-hoc subgroups in the trial showed that the efficacy of len/dex relative to dexamethasone alone remained statistically significant in subgroups that had received prior treatment with thalidomide or bortezomib and in subgroups specified by the number of previous therapies for multiple myeloma.\n【14】 A meta-analysis was also performed to combine the results of the trials and to confirm the results obtained by the pooling of trials. This resulted in a median difference in TTP of 28.24 weeks (95% CI 18.39 to 38.08 weeks) and an odds ratio for overall survival of 1.44 (95% CI 1.34 to 1.56). The hazard ratio was not calculated. There was no evidence of heterogeneity between the trials.\n【15】 An indirect comparison was undertaken to compare len/dex with bortezomib monotherapy because there were no head-to-head trials. The results of the trials for len/dex were compared with the results of the Assessment of Proteasome Inhibition for Extending Remissions (APEX) RCT. The APEX study compared bortezomib with high-dose dexamethasone. For median TTP, len/dex had a 34-week advantage over bortezomib for people who had received one prior therapy only, and there were no statistically significant differences for the secondary outcomes of complete response, partial response and progressive disease. However, this analysis is limited by the small number of data points. In addition, the common comparator (high-dose dexamethasone) was an active treatment and was not used in the same dose across the trials, and the definition of response differed between the trials.\n【16】 The economic evaluation in the manufacturer's submission used a discrete-event simulation model. This model used two separate prediction equations to calculate TTP and post-progression survival values, which were then added together to give overall survival. A cohort was created by randomly sampling (with replacement) patients from the pooled trial populations. For subgroups within the model, the cohort was created from the relevant population. The model attempted to capture the variability between individuals in the trial and to allow correlation between observed parameters to be retained.\n【17】 The model divided patients from both arms of both trials into four groups according to their level of response. In building a cohort for the study population or any of the subgroups, the model ensured that the proportion of patients achieving a particular response in the trial was replicated in the cohort. To calculate TTP, the model assumed a Weibull distribution. For bortezomib, the response rates were taken from the APEX trial and the equation for TTP was calibrated such that the median TTP was the same as that within the trial.\n【18】 The equation for post-progression survival was assumed to take an exponential form. However, the trial results were affected by the crossover of patients at unblinding from the dexamethasone arm to receive lenalidomide. Therefore the equation included an adjustment factor that calibrated the modelled median overall survival in the dexamethasone group after progression to be equal to that observed in the UK Medical Research Council (MRC) multiple myeloma trials. This assumed that survival of people with multiple myeloma in this cohort was the same when treated with dexamethasone as with all other regimens used in the MRC trials. The patient profiles from the RCTs in the manufacturer's submission were applied to the predictors in the survival equations derived from the MRC trial data to predict survival in the dexamethasone arm if crossover had not occurred.\n【19】 The model considered subgroups of patients who had received one prior therapy (with this group divided further into those who did and did not have peripheral neuropathy), patients who had received two or more prior therapies, and patients who had received thalidomide (divided further into those who had received only one prior therapy and those who had received two or more prior therapies). For patients who had received only one prior therapy, len/dex was compared with bortezomib monotherapy. For patients with peripheral neuropathy and for those who had received two or more prior therapies, the comparator was dexamethasone alone.\n【20】 The utility values were based on a study that evaluated intensive chemotherapy followed by myeloablation and autologous stem-cell transplantation in people with multiple myeloma. For the complete response, partial response and stable disease states, a utility value of 0.81 was used. This value was based on the utility of the general public at an age (median 54 years) corresponding to that of the patients in the study. A utility value of 0.64 was applied to the progressive disease state. After 2 years, a utility value of 0.77 was applied to those patients whose disease had not progressed.\n【21】 Only grade 3 and 4 adverse effects were included in the model. Utility decrements for adverse effects were not included. Resource-use data associated with, for example, adverse effects, routine follow-up and laboratory tests were collected to build up a profile of resource use, depending on disease state and treatment. Resource-use profiles were developed for people during relapse and/or on treatment, and for people in remission on maintenance therapy or off therapy. Resource use was estimated by interviewing 15 specialists across England and Wales who specialised in the management of multiple myeloma.\n【22】 The economic analysis did not produce cost-effectiveness estimates for the whole trial population. In the base case, for the subgroup with one prior therapy, the model resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained for lenalidomide that the manufacturer stated was not cost effective compared with bortezomib. For the one prior therapy subgroup, the ICER was £46,865 per QALY gained for lenalidomide compared with dexamethasone. For patients who had received two or more prior therapies the ICER was £24,584 per QALY gained. In the subgroup of patients who had received prior thalidomide, the ICERs were £38,861 per QALY gained for patients with only one prior therapy and £22,589 per QALY gained for patients who had received two or more prior therapies.\n【23】 The ERG explored the precision with which the fitted curve for len/dex matched the actual trial data used in the model. It observed that the fitted curve overestimated overall survival. The ERG noted that the overall survival curve for the dexamethasone arm in the cost-effectiveness model had been adjusted to predict the median overall survival predicted from the MRC trials. However, the ERG stated that it was more methodologically correct to adjust the dexamethasone overall survival calculation in the model to predict the mean overall survival predicted from the MRC trials, because the ICERs calculated from the model were a ratio of means and not medians.\n【24】 The ERG conducted an exploratory analysis with an improved fit of the len/dex overall survival curve and also with the dexamethasone curve adjusted to the mean overall survival in the MRC trials. For the subgroup of patients who had received only one prior therapy where len/dex was compared with bortezomib, the ICER increased more than 30-fold from the manufacturer's base case. For the subgroup who had received one prior therapy where the comparator was dexamethasone, the ICER increased from £46,865 to £69,500 per QALY gained. For the subgroup of patients who had received two or more prior therapies, the ICER increased from £24,584 to £47,100 per QALY gained. For patients who had received prior thalidomide, the ICER increased from £38,861 to £56,500 per QALY gained if they had received only one prior therapy and from £22,589 to £43,600 per QALY gained if they had received two or more prior therapies.\n【25】 In addition, the ERG noted that the costs associated with routine medical management (non-drug costs) assumed in the model were lower than the figures that were accepted in the appraisal of bortezomib and may therefore have been underestimated. It also noted that the model had no disutility attached to the occurrence of adverse effects. Finally, it noted that the cost of anti-thrombotic prophylaxis that was routinely used with lenalidomide was not included in the model. The ERG stated that the inclusion of the above considerations in the model would further increase the ICERs for all subgroups above the values obtained in the exploratory reanalyses quoted above.\n【26】 For the subgroup of patients who had received only one prior therapy, the ERG repeated the indirect comparison of len/dex with bortezomib using methods that it considered to be more appropriate. This resulted in a hazard ratio of 0.557 (95% CI 0.337 to 0.912). The ERG pointed out that this comparison was with bortezomib as monotherapy and that bortezomib was commonly used in combination with dexamethasone in routine clinical practice. The economic analysis for the comparison of len/dex with bortezomib also assumed a maximum of eight cycles of bortezomib instead of the 11 allowed in the trial, and did not model the response-based rebate scheme recommended in NICE technology appraisal guidance 129. The ERG also suggested that the administration costs associated with bortezomib may have been overestimated in the manufacturer's model. In addition, the dose intensity for bortezomib was assumed to be 100%; that is, the analysis did not allow for dose reductions and treatment interruptions, which had been included for lenalidomide. All of the above issues would have had the effect of increasing the ICERs for the comparison of len/dex with bortezomib in the subgroup of patients who had received only one prior therapy.\n【27】 After the first Appraisal Committee meeting, the manufacturer presented an updated cost-effectiveness analysis. The manufacturer stated that this updated analysis would only consider all patients who had received two or more prior therapies and the subgroup of patients who had received thalidomide as one of these prior therapies. The manufacturer accepted the ERG's approach to modelling the len/dex overall survival curve. However, the manufacturer did not agree with the calibration of the overall survival curve for dexamethasone alone in the cost-effectiveness model to the mean overall survival predicted from the MRC trials. The manufacturer stated that a curve calibrated to the mean rather than the median overall survival was less representative of the published curves, and that using the mean placed more emphasis on the tail of the distribution, where there were fewer patients and greater uncertainty. The manufacturer maintained that it was appropriate to calibrate the curve to the predicted median survival in the updated analysis. In addition, the updated analysis incorporated costs for outpatient visits into routine management costs, and inflated the routine management costs to 2008 values. The effects of adding costs for the prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis and disutility for long-term adverse effects were also explored in the updated model through sensitivity analyses. The manufacturer also proposed a patient access scheme in which the cost of lenalidomide to the NHS for a person with multiple myeloma will be capped at 26 cycles of treatment (each of 28 days, so normally administered over 2 years). A cycle will still be considered as having been completed within the scheme even if there are dose reductions and treatment interruptions during the cycle. The drug cost of lenalidomide (excluding any related costs) for people who remain on treatment for more than 26 cycles will be met by the manufacturer. The Department of Health in England and the Department of Health and Social Services in Wales accepted the consideration of this scheme by NICE.\n【28】 Taking all these factors into account in the model, for patients who had received two or more prior therapies the incremental life-year gain was 2.77, the incremental QALY gain was 1.86 and the ICER was £30,350 per QALY gained. For patients who had received thalidomide as one of the prior therapies the incremental life-year gain was 2.51, the incremental QALY gain was 1.7 and the ICER was £28,941 per QALY gained. These ICERs were relatively insensitive to the addition of costs for prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis or disutility for long-term adverse effects.\n【29】 The ERG considered the updated analyses from the manufacturer and agreed with the implementation of the stated changes. It noted that the model predicted that, for the group of patients who had received two or more prior therapies, the patient access scheme applied to 17% of the people in the model. The estimated average cost of treatment with lenalidomide to the NHS per person over a modelled lifetime (median overall survival approximately 2.7 years) decreased from £59,800 to £51,800 with the patient access scheme. For the subgroup of patients who had received thalidomide as one of their prior therapies the patient access scheme applied to 11% of people in the model, and the modelled lifetime cost of treatment with lenalidomide to the NHS per person decreased from £49,800 to £46,300 with the patient access scheme.\n【30】 The ERG repeated the exploratory analysis on the updated model using their preferred approach with the dexamethasone overall survival curve calibrated to the mean survival predicted from the MRC trials and the patient access scheme implemented in the model. For the subgroup of patients who had received two or more prior therapies, the incremental life-year gain was 1.81 and the incremental QALY gain was 1.24 at an incremental cost of £54,291, giving an ICER of £43,800 per QALY gained. For patients who had received thalidomide as one of the prior therapies, the incremental life-year gain was 1.71 and the incremental QALY gain was 1.15 at an incremental cost of £47,531, giving an ICER of £41,300 per QALY gained.\n【31】 Full details of all the evidence are in the manufacturer's submission and the ERG report.# Consideration of the evidence\n【32】 The Appraisal Committee reviewed the data available on the clinical and cost effectiveness of lenalidomide, having considered evidence on the nature of multiple myeloma and the value placed on the benefits of lenalidomide by people with the condition, those who represent them, and clinical specialists. It was also mindful of the need to take account of the effective use of NHS resources.\n【33】 The Committee understood that multiple myeloma is an incurable disease. It was aware that the disease and its course are heterogeneous and that for relapsed multiple myeloma the choice of therapy for a particular person is influenced by the initial treatment and their response to it, the inherent characteristics of the disease and the person's performance status and preferences. The Committee heard from clinical specialists and patient experts that lenalidomide is an important advance in the treatment of multiple myeloma and could be considered as an alternative to bortezomib (currently recommended as a treatment option in NICE technology appraisal guidance 129) at first relapse. The Committee noted the importance that patients, their carers and physicians placed on having effective options to treat multiple myeloma at presentation and at subsequent relapses. However, it understood that the optimal sequence of agents to use is as yet unclear and depends on several factors, including a person's treatment history, comorbidities and disease characteristics.\n【34】 The Committee understood that, in accordance with current NICE guidance (NICE technology appraisal guidance 129), bortezomib is routinely used in clinical practice for the treatment of progressive multiple myeloma in people who are at first relapse having received only one prior therapy. Therefore it considered bortezomib to be the most appropriate comparator for lenalidomide in people who have had only one prior therapy. The Committee noted that bortezomib is usually used in combination with dexamethasone, but that there is variation in clinical practice and limited formal evidence for the superior efficacy of this combination compared with bortezomib monotherapy.\n【35】 The Committee considered the options available for the treatment of multiple myeloma at second and subsequent relapse. Current NICE guidance restricts the use of bortezomib to first relapse because the use of bortezomib at subsequent relapses was found not to be cost effective (NICE technology appraisal guidance 129), with ICERs of £77,000 or more per life year gained. Thalidomide is not licensed for this indication, and an application for a licence for the treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma was withdrawn. However, thalidomide is used as a treatment option for multiple myeloma within the NHS, although the extent of this use is not known. The Committee also noted a statement from the manufacturer that there is a lack of evidence for the efficacy of thalidomide for this indication, particularly after failure of two or more therapies. The Committee understood that a variety of other regimens could be used at second and subsequent relapse, but that no studies had been identified that have demonstrated the superiority of these compared with dexamethasone alone. Therefore it accepted that in people who have received two or more prior therapies, high-dose dexamethasone was a reasonable comparator for lenalidomide.\n【36】 The Committee discussed the RCTs comparing len/dex with dexamethasone alone for the management of relapsed multiple myeloma. It noted that TTP (the primary outcome) was statistically significantly increased in the len/dex arm for the whole trial population as well as in subgroups of people who had received prior therapy with bortezomib or thalidomide. It considered that the RCTs provided evidence that overall survival and response rates were also higher with len/dex compared with dexamethasone alone. The Committee concluded that the len/dex combination improved outcomes in people with relapsed multiple myeloma when compared with dexamethasone. This included people who had received either one or two or more prior therapies, and when prior therapies included the use of thalidomide.\n【37】 The Committee next discussed the relative effectiveness of len/dex compared with bortezomib. It noted that the evidence for the effectiveness of len/dex compared with bortezomib monotherapy was derived from an indirect comparison via the common comparator of high-dose dexamethasone. It considered that there was uncertainty in the results of the indirect comparison because of heterogeneity between the studies, such as differences in the regimen of dexamethasone and the definition of response. The Committee noted that there was additional uncertainty in interpreting the context of current practice, as it understood that bortezomib is usually used in combination with dexamethasone in clinical practice.\n【38】 The Committee discussed the adverse effects associated with lenalidomide. It noted that from the patients' viewpoint lenalidomide is associated with a more favourable adverse effect profile than most other regimens and agents used in the management of relapsed multiple myeloma. It heard from clinical specialists and patient experts that lenalidomide might be particularly useful for people with pre-existing peripheral neuropathy, in whom the use of bortezomib at first relapse is restricted. However, the Committee noted that lenalidomide is associated with a statistically significant increased risk of venous thrombosis and embolism. It heard from clinical specialists that this risk is usually managed with prophylaxis in the form of low-dose aspirin in people with multiple myeloma. However, in people with a history of venous thromboembolism or other relevant risk factors, the use of warfarin or low-molecular-weight heparin would be considered. The Committee heard that with such prophylaxis the risk would return to baseline levels. The additional cost incurred for the management of people with multiple myeloma would be minimal if low-dose aspirin was used, but could have an impact if either low-molecular-weight heparin or warfarin was needed.\n【39】 The Committee considered the manufacturer's economic evaluation of the use of lenalidomide and the critique from the ERG. It accepted that the general structure of the manufacturer's model was reasonable. It considered that the subgroups in the model were those relevant to decision-making in routine clinical practice. It discussed the sensitivity and scenario analyses presented by the manufacturer, as well as those explored by the ERG using the manufacturer's model. In particular, the Committee discussed the methods used for adjustment for the crossover effect in the RCTs, the extrapolation of survival data, the costs of medical management and administration of bortezomib therapy, and the utility values reflecting health-related quality of life for the pre-progression and post-progression states and from adverse effects.\n【40】 The Committee noted that the trial results included a crossover effect and considered whether it was appropriate to use data from historical MRC trials to predict survival for people treated with dexamethasone in this population in the absence of an unbiased estimate from the trials of lenalidomide. The Committee was aware that the MRC data were derived from trials of agents in first-line therapy for multiple myeloma. Despite this, it accepted that these data represented the best available survival data for people with multiple myeloma to be used in extrapolation of overall survival in the current analysis. The Committee also noted that use of these data assumed that dexamethasone monotherapy was a suitable proxy (in the absence of more specific evidence) for all anti-myeloma therapies used in relapse. The Committee also considered that there was no evidence to indicate that the effectiveness of dexamethasone in relation to survival had changed over time since the MRC trials. It accepted the statements from the clinical specialists indicating that where improvements were noticed these were likely to be attributable to the use of the newer agents and stem-cell transplantation.\n【41】 The Committee considered the ERG's exploratory reanalysis with an improved fit of the len/dex overall survival curve to the trial data and calibration of the dexamethasone overall survival curve to predict mean (and not median) overall survival based on a risk equation for survival derived from the MRC trials. The Committee considered that the ERG's approach to modelling overall survival in both the len/dex and dexamethasone arms was valid and resulted in more plausible estimates of cost effectiveness than those presented by the manufacturer. The Committee noted that these adjustments to the modelling of survival may have different effects in different subgroups and that the ERG's adjustments had been made separately to subgroups defined according to number of prior therapies.\n【42】 The Committee considered the base-case ICERs resulting from the manufacturer's economic analysis, as well as the results of the ERG's exploratory analysis using the alternative approach to the modelling of overall survival. It noted that, in the manufacturer's base case, none of the ICERs for lenalidomide for the subgroups with only one prior therapy were within the range that would normally be considered a cost-effective use of NHS resources. The Committee noted that the comparison of len/dex with bortezomib in the subgroup of people who had received only one prior therapy resulted in a high ICER. The Committee also considered that the ICER for the comparison with bortezomib would increase further if the model took into account: the bortezomib response-based rebate scheme (as described in NICE technology appraisal guidance 129); the lower costs of bortezomib administration suggested by the ERG; the higher maximum number of cycles of bortezomib; and the likely dosage reduction for bortezomib. When the ERG's approach to modelling overall survival was used, the ICER was more than £69,000 per QALY gained for the comparison of lenalidomide with dexamethasone in people who had received one prior therapy only. For the comparison with dexamethasone in people who had received one prior therapy and that therapy was thalidomide, the ICER was more than £56,000 per QALY gained.\n【43】 The Committee considered other issues with the base-case analysis. The model did not fully include costs and utility decrements owing to adverse effects, and the Committee considered that if appropriate costs and disutilities for adverse effects and anti-thrombosis prophylaxis were used in the model, the ICERs for lenalidomide would increase. It also noted that the utility in the model for the pre-progression state was that of the normal population at age 54 years, and that this is considerably younger than the average age of people who usually develop multiple myeloma. The Committee noted the results of the exploratory analysis by the ERG, which showed that using lower administration costs for bortezomib, using higher costs for routine medical management and modelling the bortezomib response-based rebate scheme all had the effect of increasing the ICERs for lenalidomide for the subgroup of patients who had received one prior therapy. The Committee concluded that, in the light of these additional issues, the most plausible ICERs in all subgroups would be higher than those stated in 4.11.\n【44】 The Committee discussed the updated analysis presented by the manufacturer. It noted that the manufacturer had chosen not to present any new analysis for people who had received only one prior therapy. The Committee discussed whether there were any further factors that would have a bearing on its considerations about the cost effectiveness of lenalidomide in this patient group. These included the degree of certainty in the ICERs, the severity of the illness experienced by people with multiple myeloma who have received one prior therapy and the innovative nature of lenalidomide. It did not identify any factors that would alter its conclusions based on the evidence currently available. Overall, the Committee concluded that the use of lenalidomide for the treatment of multiple myeloma in people who had received only one prior therapy would not be a cost-effective use of NHS resources.\n【45】 The Committee considered the subgroups of people who had received two or more prior therapies, including the subgroup who had received thalidomide as one of these therapies. When the ERG's approach to modelling overall survival was used, the ICERs for lenalidomide for these subgroups increased to at least £47,100 per QALY gained for those who had received two or more prior therapies, and to at least £43,600 per QALY gained for those who had received two or more prior therapies of which one was thalidomide.\n【46】 The Committee discussed the updated analysis from the manufacturer and the exploratory reanalysis by the ERG for people who had received two or more prior therapies. The Committee concluded that the changes to the len/dex curve, utilities and costs had been implemented appropriately. The Committee noted that the variable that had the greatest impact on cost effectiveness was the method of calibrating the dexamethasone overall survival curve in the economic model (that is, to the predicted median or mean survival for the trial population) from the risk equation for survival derived from the MRC trials. The Committee noted that the data from the MRC trials were complete, with most participants having reached the outcome of interest (that is, there was very little censoring of the data), and that in such a situation the mean was a better estimate of average survival. It considered that, since the mean overall survival was used in the calculations of cost effectiveness, calibrating the overall survival predicted by the MRC data calibration model to the mean was more representative of the costs and benefits for this population. In addition, the Committee noted that when median survival was used to calibrate the survival curve, the improvement in overall survival predicted by the model was out of proportion to the observed improvement in progression-free survival from the lenalidomide trials. This relationship between the progression-free survival and overall survival from the lenalidomide trials was, however, maintained when calibrating the overall survival curve in the dexamethasone arm to the mean survival predicted from the MRC trials. The Committee understood that the choice between the use of mean or median survival was a scientific judgement, but concluded that for the purposes of decision-making in this situation, the ICER estimates from using the mean were most appropriate.\n【47】 The Committee accepted that the patient access scheme for lenalidomide was correctly implemented by the manufacturer in the economic evaluation. It noted that, in the economic model, the patient access scheme was included by capping the maximum cost of lenalidomide for an individual patient at 26 cycles of 28 days each, equivalent to 2 years. The Committee noted that the manufacturer stated that treatment interruptions within cycles were generally short, and that no patients missed entire cycles in the clinical trial. The cost of lenalidomide per cycle in the model was adjusted, as in the base case, to take into account the treatment reductions and interruptions noted in the first 23 cycles in the trials. The Committee concluded that the relevant and appropriate ICERs upon which to make a decision were £43,800 per QALY gained for the subgroup of patients who had received two or more prior therapies and £41,300 per QALY gained for the subgroup who had received two or more prior therapies including thalidomide. These ICERs represented the cost effectiveness of lenalidomide with the patient access scheme triggered after 26 cycles, regardless of any dose reductions or treatment interruptions that may occur during a cycle, and were the basis for the Committee's decisions.\n【48】 The Committee considered supplementary advice from NICE that should be taken into account when appraising treatments that may extend the life of patients with a short life expectancy and that are licensed for indications that affect small numbers of people with incurable illnesses. For this advice to be applied, all the following criteria must be met.\n【49】 The treatment is indicated for patients with a short life expectancy, normally less than 24 months.\n【50】 There is sufficient evidence to indicate that the treatment offers an extension to life, normally of at least an additional 3 months, compared with current NHS treatment.\n【51】 No alternative treatment with comparable benefits is available through the NHS.\n【52】 The treatment is licensed or otherwise indicated for small patient populations.In addition, when taking these criteria into account, the Committee must be persuaded that the estimates of the extension to life are robust and that the assumptions used in the reference case economic modelling are plausible, objective and robust.\n【53】 The Committee next discussed whether the subgroup of people with multiple myeloma who had received two or more prior therapies, and the benefit provided by lenalidomide, fulfilled the criteria for consideration as an appraisal of a life-extending, end-of-life treatment. The Committee noted from the clinical trials and the MRC data that normal life expectancy without lenalidomide was unlikely to be greater than 24 months and was potentially as low as 9 months. The Committee considered that evidence from the lenalidomide trials suggested that lenalidomide increased survival by more than 3 months compared with dexamethasone, and that crossover in the dexamethasone arm means that this benefit is likely to have been underestimated. The Committee considered that the potential alternatives, thalidomide and bortezomib, were unlikely to be routinely available on the NHS, as discussed in section 4.4. The Committee noted from the manufacturer's submission that the estimated eligible population was approximately 2100. In summary, the Committee was satisfied that the population and the technology of interest meet the criteria for accepting that this is an appraisal of a life-extending, end-of-life treatment and that the evidence presented for this consideration was supported by robust data.\n【54】 The Committee subsequently considered the ERG's cost-effectiveness estimates using the manufacturer's model in the context of a life-extending, end-of-life treatment. It noted that the QALY increment associated with the most plausible cost-effectiveness estimates was approximately 1.24 QALYs. The Committee considered that the magnitude of the additional weight that would need to be assigned to the original QALY benefit for the cost effectiveness of lenalidomide to fall within the currently applied ICER threshold range was acceptable. Additionally, the Committee noted from the model that the extension to life with lenalidomide was approximately 1.81 years. The Committee considered that the impact of giving greater weight to QALYs achieved in the later stages of terminal diseases, using the assumption that the extended survival period is experienced at the full quality of life anticipated for a healthy person of the same age, was acceptable.\n【55】 In summary, the Committee accepted that, for people with multiple myeloma who had received two or more prior therapies, the most plausible ICERs were those suggested by the ERG on the basis of exploration of the manufacturer's model and with the implementation of the patient access scheme (where the manufacturer would bear the costs of lenalidomide beyond 26 cycles  for people whose disease had not progressed at this time). For the purpose of the recommendations, the patient access scheme would be triggered by the completion of 26 cycles (which normally takes 2 years), regardless of treatment interruptions and dose reductions within those cycles. The Committee accepted that the benefits provided by lenalidomide fitted the criteria for consideration for appraising a life-extending, end-of-life treatment. The Committee concluded that the additional weights that need to be attached to the QALYs to achieve ICERs within the normal threshold range are acceptable in these circumstances. Consequently the Committee recommended lenalidomide, within its licensed indication, as an option for the treatment of multiple myeloma in people who have received two or more prior therapies. The Committee noted that some people who have not received two or more prior therapies may be currently receiving lenalidomide for the treatment of multiple myeloma, and recommended that these people should have the option to continue treatment until they and their clinicians consider it appropriate to stop.# Recommendations for further research \n【56】 The Committee considered that rigorous data collection is needed on the life-extending benefits of lenalidomide when used in people with multiple myeloma who have received two or more prior therapies.", "title": "Lenalidomide for the treatment of multiple myeloma in people who have received at least 2 prior therapies", "tags": "", "lang": "", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"overview\": \"Evidence-based recommendations on lenalidomide (Revlimid) for treating multiple myeloma in adults who have had at least 2 prior therapies.\", \"url\": \"https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ta171\", \"id\": \"60bfe35257fc6b27d424af3cec6ea350281fa1a3\", \"source\": \"nice\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-01-28 23:08:00", "update_time": "2024-01-29 00:01:49"}

They should explain the alternative management options and the likely need for additional treatments. They should provide parents or carers with clear, written information.

When the weakness is severe, the trachea can collapse during inspiration, obstructing the normal airflow. It is often associated with congenital abnormalities of the oesophagus. Symptoms may include breathing problems, such as coughing, wheezing, high-pitched breathing (stridor), respiratory tract infections and reflex apnoea/bradycardia ('dying spells'). In addition, there may be feeding difficulties. Mild to moderate symptoms in children usually improve with age. Treatments for children with this condition include the use of humidified air, chest physiotherapy and medication to control infection. Supplemental oxygen is sometimes required and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) may be used to treat short-term respiratory distress.\n【10】 Surgery may be required if conservative management fails or if symptoms are severe (such as in reflex apnoea/bradycardia). Surgical options include endoluminal or extraluminal stenting of the trachea, tracheostomy, segmental tracheal resection, and open aortopexy.\n【11】 # Outline of the procedure\n【12】 Thoracoscopic aortopexy is performed under general anaesthesia. A telescope and other instruments are inserted into the mediastinum through small incisions on the chest wall and used to visualise the operative field and to carry out the procedure. The left lobe of the thymus is moved aside or removed to expose the aortic arch. Several polypropylene sutures are passed through the sternum and into the mediastinum in close proximity to the aortic arch. These are tightened so that the aortic arch and the trachea that lies behind it are both pulled forward, making the tracheal wall less likely to collapse on inspiration. Adequacy of the procedure can be verified by intraoperative bronchoscopy, which shows an enlarged tracheal lumen.\n【13】 # Efficacy\n【14】 In a case series of six children, there were two recurrences of life-threatening events after thoracoscopic aortopexy (at 2 and 4 weeks respectively), after which both children underwent a repeat procedure. At a mean follow-up of 27 months, all six children were described as 'doing well' with no further life-threatening events.\n【15】 A case report stated that two children improved 'dramatically' after the procedure and all stridor disappeared. Oxygen saturation improved from less than 85–90% before surgery to 96–100% postoperatively. Both children gained weight and were well at 17-month and 27-month follow-up.\n【16】 A second case report of a child treated with thoracoscopic aortopexy stated that a follow-up bronchoscopy 7 months after surgery showed the child had a patent airway with no significant collapse. At 22-month follow-up the child was well, no longer fatigued easily with activity and had experienced no more reflex apnoea/bradycardia spells.\n【17】 A third case report of a child treated with thoracoscopic aortopexy reported appropriate growth and no feeding or respiratory difficulties at follow-up (period not stated).\n【18】 A fourth case report stated that there was immediate resolution of tracheomalacia after thoracoscopic aortopexy and long-term resolution of clinical respiratory symptoms at 1 year. For more details, refer to the 'Sources of evidence' section.\n【19】 The Specialist Advisers listed key efficacy outcomes as improvement of symptoms (cyanotic episodes, stridor and lower respiratory tract infections), the ability to breathe unsupported, the degree of correction as assessed at bronchoscopy, and growth (assessed using standard growth charts).\n【20】 # Safety\n【21】 The case series of six children reported that no adverse events occurred. Two of the four case reports stated that there were no complications associated with the procedure and one stated that there was 'no notable blood loss'. One case report stated that extubation was delayed because of upper airway oedema (resolved with steroid treatment). For more details, refer to the 'Sources of evidence' section.\n【22】 The Specialist Advisers listed potential adverse events as life-threatening haemorrhage that cannot be controlled without opening the chest, temporary or permanent injury to one or both phrenic nerves, pneumothorax, and mediastinitis.\n【23】 # Other comments\n【24】 The Committee noted that the National Commissioning Group (NCG), which has a remit to commission highly specialised national services for very rare conditions for the population of England, has designated and commissioned Great Ormond Street Hospital to provide a service for complex tracheal disease, including severe tracheomalacia. Scottish residents also have access to the service under an agreement between the NCG and the National Services Division, Scotland. Health Commission Wales has a separate agreement with the provider for Welsh residents.# Further information\n【25】 This guidance requires that clinicians undertaking the procedure make special arrangements for audit. The Institute has identified relevant audit criteria and has developed an audit tool (which is for use at local discretion).\n【26】 Andrew DillonChief ExecutiveDecember 2007\n【27】 # Sources of evidence\n【28】 The evidence considered by the Interventional Procedures Advisory Committee is described in the following document.\n【29】 'Interventional procedure overview of thoracoscopic aortopexy for severe primary tracheomalacia', April 2007.\n【30】 # Information for patients\n【31】 NICE has produced information describing its guidance on this procedure for parents and carers ('Understanding NICE guidance'). It explains the nature of the procedure and the decision made, and has been written with consent in mind.# About this guidance\n【32】 NICE interventional procedure guidance makes recommendations on the safety and efficacy of the procedure. It does not cover whether or not the NHS should fund a procedure. Funding decisions are taken by local NHS bodies after considering the clinical effectiveness of the procedure and whether it represents value for money for the NHS. It is for healthcare professionals and people using the NHS in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, and is endorsed by Healthcare Improvement Scotland for implementation by NHSScotland.\n【33】 This guidance was developed using the NICE interventional procedure guidance process.\n【34】 We have produced a summary of this guidance for patients and carers. Tools to help you put the guidance into practice and information about the evidence it is based on are also available.\n【35】 Changes since publication\n【36】 January 2012: minor maintenance.\n【37】 Your responsibility\n【38】 This guidance represents the views of NICE and was arrived at after careful consideration of the available evidence. Healthcare professionals are expected to take it fully into account when exercising their clinical judgement. This guidance does not, however, override the individual responsibility of healthcare professionals to make appropriate decisions in the circumstances of the individual patient, in consultation with the patient and/or guardian or carer.\n【39】 Implementation of this guidance is the responsibility of local commissioners and/or providers. Commissioners and providers are reminded that it is their responsibility to implement the guidance, in their local context, in light of their duties to avoid unlawful discrimination and to have regard to promoting equality of opportunity. Nothing in this guidance should be interpreted in a way which would be inconsistent with compliance with those duties.\n【40】 Copyright\n【41】 © National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence 2007.

Causes of Nephrotic Syndrome can be primary (idiopathic) or secondary (from a systemic insult or immune mediated). Nephrotic syndrome (nephrosis) is defined as heavy proteinuria > 3.5 grams per 24 hours in adults. In children, nephrotic syndrome is defined as protein excretion > 40 mg/m2/h. The accurate diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome thus requires 24-hour urine collection. However, in clinical practice, urine dipstick of a qualitative measure of 3+ urinary proteins, or spot urine protein (mg)/creatinine(mg) ratio > 2 may also reflect nephrotic syndrome.\n【3】 # Historical perspective\n【4】 In 1484, Cornelus Roelans of Belgium described a child with “whole body swelling” and nephropathy. In 1905, Friedrich v. Müller described the term \"nephrosis\". Initially, nephrosis was defined by morphological terms describing various histological alterations of the renal tubuli which were considered to be degenerative. Today nephrosis is a clinical diagnosis, and usually called nephrotic syndrome. \n【5】 # Classification\n【6】 Nephrotic syndrome can be classified into primary or secondary depending on the underlying etiology.  Primary (idiopathic) nephrotic syndrome is defined as nephrotic syndrome due to a primary glomerular disease.  Secondary nephrotic syndrome is defined as nephrotic syndrome due to a primary etiology other than glomerular disorders, such as infections, malignancies, systemic conditions, and medications.\n【7】 # Pathophysiology\n【8】 The pathophysiology of hypoalbuminemia in nephrotic syndrome is multifactorial. Proteinuria plays an important role in the pathogenesis of hyperlipidemia in nephrotic syndrome. Neurohormonal changes in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, vasopressin, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), and sympathetic nervous system are is implicated in edema formation in nephrotic syndrome.\n【9】 # Causes\n【10】 Nephrotic syndrome can occur primarily or due to systemic diseases. The most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children is minimal change disease. The most common primary causes in adults are focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), minimal change disease, and membranous nephropathy. Approximately 30 percent of adults have secondary nephrotic syndrome due to diabetes mellitus, SLE, or amyloidosis. The most common cause of secondary nephrotic syndrome in adults is diabetes mellitus.\n【11】 # Differential Diagnosis\n【12】 Nephrotic syndrome should be differentiate from other causes of glomerular disease such as Fabry's disease, post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, lupus nephritis, antiglomerular basement membrane disease (goodpasture's syndrome), Cryoglobulinemia, Henoch-Schönlein purpura, amyloidosis, pulmonary-renal syndromes (vasculitis), thin basement membrane disease, Alport's Syndrome, anti-GBM Disease, hypertensive nephrosclerosis, and subacute bacterial endocarditis. The various types of glomerular diseases may be differentiated from each other based on associations, presence of pitting edema, hematuria, hypertension, hemoptysis, oliguria, peri-orbital edema, hyperlipidemia, type of antibodies, light, and electron microscopic features.\n【13】 # Epidemiology and Demographics\n【14】 Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome has an incidence of 2-7 cases per 100,000 and a prevalence of 16 cases per 100,000. Nephrotic syndrome may affect children and adults alike. There is no age or ethnic predominance. The prevalence of nephrotic syndrome in children has a 2 to 1 male to female ratio.\n【15】 # Natural History, Complications and Prognosis\n【16】 Complications of nephrotic syndrome include infections, thrombotic events, and renal failure. Mortality and overall prognosis depends on the occurrence of complications and adherence to medications.\n【17】 # Diagnosis\n【18】 ## History and Symptoms\n【19】 The hallmark of nephrotic syndrome is edema. A positive history of renal disease, systemic diseases such as diabetes mellitus, amyloidosis, or systemic lupus erythematosus, and medication use is suggestive of nephrotic syndrome. The most common symptoms of nephrotic syndrome include volume overload, foamy urine, and fatigue.\n【20】 ## Physical Examination\n【21】 A full physical examination should be performed among patients presenting with nephrotic syndrome. Findings on physical examination suggestive of secondary etiologies may be present, such as characteristic rash in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), or peripheral neuropathy in diabetes mellitus.\n【22】 ## Laboratory Findings\n【23】 Nephrotic syndrome is characterized by the following laboratory findings: proteinuria > 3.5g/24 hrs on 24-hour urine collection, proteinuria on urine dipstick, and urine protein/creatinine ratio > 3.  When nephrotic syndrome is diagnosed (proteinuria > 3.5 g/24 hrs), additional laboratory tests are required such as serum albumin concentration, serum chemistry panel, lipid panel, and serum creatinine concentration.\n【24】 ## Chest X-Ray\n【25】 Chest X-ray may show signs of pleural effusion.\n【26】 ## Ultrasound\n【27】 Renal and abdominal doppler ultrasound may be required to investigate for renal etiologies and complications of disease, such as renal vein thrombosis. Kidney size and signs of obstruction during assessment are also important. Doppler ultrasound of the extremities is indicated if patients with nephrotic syndrome present with suspected deep vein thrombosis.\n【28】 ## Other Imaging Findings\n【29】 Renal vein thrombosis, a complication of nephrotic syndrome, may require any of venography, CT scan, or MRI for appropriate diagnosis.\n【30】 ## Biopsy\n【31】 Ultrasound-guided renal biopsy for visualization under light microscopy, immunofluorescence or immunoperoxidase, and electron microscopy is usually recommended for patients with nephrotic syndrome. Renal biopsy provides diagnostic and prognostic benefit. However, guidelines that define the timing and the circumstances to perform renal biopsy are not present. In minimal change disease, the most common primary cause of nephrotic syndrome in children, and in diabetic nephropathy, the most common secondary cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults, renal biopsy is not generally recommended and is not routinely performed. Nonetheless, patients who present with unknown or unsure etiology of nephrotic syndrome are recommended to undergo renal biopsy for definitive diagnosis.\n【32】 # Treatment\n【33】 ## Medical Therapy\n【34】 There are currently no guidelines for the management of edema associated with nephrotic syndrome. The slow reversal of edema is important at a rate of 0.5-1 kg daily to prevent electrolyte disturbances, hypotension, ischemic acute tubular necrosis, and hemoconcentration associated with aggressive diuretic therapy. Since proteinuria is one of the most significant factors for progression of a disease and is associated with outcome, treatment of proteinuria in nephrotic syndrome must always be considered a priority. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I), with or without angiotensin-II receptor blockers (ARB) have been extensively studied and are well-known to decrease proteinuria and the risk of progression of renal disease in patients with nephrotic syndrome.

A boxplot also indicates which observations, if any, might be considered outliers. The boxplot was invented in 1977 by the American statistician John Tukey.\n【3】 Boxplots are able to visually show different types of populations, without making any assumptions of the underlying statistical distribution. The spacings between the different parts of the box help indicate variance, skewness and identify outliers.  Boxplots can be drawn either horizontally or vertically.\n【4】 # Construction\n【5】 For a data set, one constructs a horizontal box plot in the following manner:\n【6】 - Calculate the first quartile (x.25), the median (x.50) and third quartile (x.75)\n【7】 - Calculate the interquartile range (IQR) by subtracting the first quartile from the third quartile. (x.75-x.25)\n【8】 - Construct a box above the number line bounded on the left by the first quartile (x.25) and on the right by the third quartile (x.75).  The box may be as tall as one likes, although reasonably proportioned boxplots are customary.\n【9】 - Indicate where the median lies inside of the box with the presence of a symbol or a line dividing the box at the median value.\n【10】 - The mean value of the data can also be labeled with a point.\n【11】 - Any data observation which lies more than 1.5*IQR lower than the first quartile or 1.5*IQR higher than the third quartile is considered an outlier.  Indicate where the smallest value that is not an outlier is by a vertical tic mark or \"whisker\", and connect the whisker to the box via a horizontal line.  Likewise, indicate where the largest value that is not an outlier is by a \"whisker\", and connect that whisker to the box via another horizontal line.\n【12】 - Indicate outliers by open and closed dots.  \"Extreme\" outliers, or those which lie more than three times the IQR to the left and right from the first and third quartiles, respectively, are indicated by the presence of an open dot.  \"Mild\" outliers - that is, those observations which lie more than 1.5 times the IQR from the first and third quartile but are not also extreme outliers are indicated by the presence of a closed dot.\n【13】 - Add an appropriate label to the number line and title the boxplot.\n【14】 - A boxplot may be constructed in a similar manner vertically as opposed to horizontally by merely interchanging \"bottom\" for \"left\" and \"top\" for \"right\" in the above description.\n【15】 # Example\n【16】 A plain-text version might look like this:\n【17】 For this data set:\n【18】 - smallest non-outlier observation = 5 (left \"whisker\")\n【19】 - lower (first) quartile (Q1, x.25) = 7\n【20】 - median (second quartile) (Med, x.5) = 8.5\n【21】 - upper (third) quartile (Q3, x.75) = 9\n【22】 - largest non-outlier observation = 10\n【23】 - interquartile range, IQR = Q3-Q1 = 2\n【24】 - the value 3.5 is a \"mild\" outlier, between 1.5*(IQR) and 3*(IQR) below Q1\n【25】 - the value 0.5 is an \"extreme\" outlier, more than 3*(IQR) below Q1\n【26】 - the data is skewed to the left (negatively skewed)\n【27】 The horizontal lines (the \"whiskers\") extend to at most 1.5 times the box width (the interquartile range) from either or both ends of the box. They must end at an observed value, thus connecting all the values outside the box that are not more than 1.5 times the box width away from the box. Three times the box width marks the boundary between \"mild\" and \"extreme\" outliers.  In this boxplot, \"mild\" and \"extreme\" outliers are differentiated by closed and open dots, respectively.\n【28】 There are alternative implementations of this detail of the box plot in various software packages, such as the whiskers extending to at most the 5th and 95th (or some more extreme) percentiles. Such approaches do not conform to Tukey's definition, with its emphasis on the median in particular and counting methods in general, and they tend to produce \"outliers\" for all data sets larger than ten, no matter what the shape of the distribution.\n【29】 # Visualization\n【30】 The boxplot is a quick graphic approach for examining one or more sets of data.  Boxplots may seem more primitive than a histogram or probability density function (pdf) but they do have some advantages.  Besides saving space on paper, boxplots are quicker to generate by hand.  Histograms and probability density functions require assumptions of the statistical distribution.  This assumption can be a major barrier because binning techniques can heavily influence the histogram and incorrect variance calculations will heavily affect the probability density function.\n【31】 Because looking at a statistical distribution is more intuitive than looking at a boxplot, comparing the boxplot against the probability density function (theoretical histogram) for a normal N(0,1σ2) distribution may be a useful tool for understanding the boxplot (Figure 2).", "title": "Box plot", "tags": "", "lang": "", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"id\": \"aa5ceb055c20ee875483cf7edffbc93d05c8df4a\", \"source\": \"wikidoc\", \"url\": \"https://www.wikidoc.org/index.php/Box_plot\", \"overview\": \"None\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"type3": "无关文本#31#31# (Figure 2)."}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-01-28 23:08:00", "update_time": "2024-02-18 19:37:51"}

Domesticated organisms are those that have adapted to survival with the help of (or under the control of) humans, after many generations. Domesticating wild plant and animal species for human benefit has occurred many times all over the planet, and has had a major impact on the environment, both positive and negative.\n【2】 Wildlife can be found in all ecosystems. Deserts, rainforests, plains, and other areas—including the most developed urban sites—all have distinct forms of wildlife. While the term in popular culture usually refers to animals that are untouched by human factors, most scientists agree that wildlife around the world is impacted by human activities.\n【3】 Humans have historically tended to separate civilization from wildlife in a number of ways including the legal, social, and moral sense. This has been a reason for debate throughout recorded history. Religions have often declared certain animals to be sacred, and in modern times concern for the environment has provoked activists to protest the exploitation of wildlife for human benefit or entertainment.\n【4】 Literature has also made use of the traditional human separation from wildlife.\n【5】 # Food\n【6】 Anthropologists believe that the Stone Age peoples and hunter-gatherers relied on wildlife, both plant and animal, for their food.  In fact, some species may have been hunted to extinction by early human hunters.  Today, hunting, fishing, or gathering wildlife is still a significant food source in some parts of the world. In other areas, hunting and non-commercial fishing are mainly seen as a sport or recreation, with the edible meat as mostly a side benefit.  Meat sourced from wildlife that is not traditionally regarded as game is known as bushmeat. The increasing demand for wildlife as a source of traditional food in East Asia is decimating populations of sharks, primates, pangolins and other animals, which they believe have aphrodisiac properties.\n【7】 # Religion\n【8】 Many wildlife species have spiritual significance in different cultures around the world, and they and their products may be used as sacred objects in religious rituals. For example, eagles, hawks and their feathers have great cultural and spiritual value to Native Americans as religious objects.inu\n【9】 # Television\n【10】 Wildlife has long been a common subject for educational television shows. National Geographic specials appeared on CBS beginning in 1965, later moving to ABC and then PBS. In 1963, NBC debuted Wild Kingdom, a popular program featuring zoologist Marlin Perkins as host. The  BBC natural history unit in the UK was a similar pioneer, the first wildlife series LOOK presented by Sir Peter Scott, was a studio-based show, with filmed inserts.  It was in this series that David Attenborough first made his appearance which led to the series Zoo Quest during which he and cameraman Charles Lagus went to many exotic places looking for elusive wildlife -- notably the Komodo dragon in Indonesia and lemurs in Madagascar. Since 1984, the Discovery Channel and its spinoff Animal Planet in the USA have dominated the market for shows about wildlife on cable television, while on PBS the NATURE strand made by WNET-13 in New York and NOVA by WGBH in Boston are notable. See also Nature documentary. Wildlife television is now a multi-million dollar industry with specialist documentary film-makers in many countries including UK, USA, New Zealand NHNZ, Australia, Austria, Germany, Japan, and Canada.\n【11】 # Tourism\n【12】 Fuelled by media coverage and inclusion of conservation education in early school curriculum, Wildlife  tourism & Ecotourism has fast become a popular industry generating substantial income for poor nations with rich wildlife specially in Africa and India. This ever growing and ever becoming more popular form of tourism is providing the much needed incentive for poor nations to conserve their rich wildlife heritage and it's habitat.\n【13】 # Destruction\n【14】 This subsection focuses on anthropogenic forms of wildlife destruction.\n【15】 Exploitation of wild populations has been a characteristic of modern man since our exodus from Africa 130,000 – 70,000 years ago.  The rate of extinctions of entire species of plants and animals across the planet has been so high in the last few hundred years it is widely considered that we are in the sixth great extinction event on this planet; the Holocene Mass Extinction.\n【16】 Destruction of wildlife does not always lead to an extinction of the species in question, however, the dramatic loss of entire species across Earth dominates any review of wildlife destruction as extinction is the level of damage to a wild population from which there is no return.\n【17】 The four most general reasons that lead to destruction of wildlife include overkill, habitat destruction and fragmentation, impact of introduced species and chains of extinction.\n【18】 ## Overkill\n【19】 Overkill occurs whenever hunting occurs at rate greater than the reproductive capacity of the population being exploited.  The effects of this are often noticed much more dramatically in slow growing populations such as many larger species of fish.  Initially when a portion of a wild population is hunted, an increased availability of resources (food, etc) is experienced increasing growth and reproduction as Density dependent inhibition is lowered.  Hunting, fishing and so on, has lowered the competition between members of a population.  However, if this hunting continues at rate greater than the rate at which new members of the population can reach breeding age and produce more young, the population will begin to decrease in numbers.\n【20】 Populations in confined to islands – whether literal islands or just areas of habitat that are effectively an “island” for the species concerned – have also been observed to be at greater risk of dramatic population declines following unsustainable hunting.Overkill is really very very dangerous to our animals.\n【21】 ## Habitat destruction and fragmentation\n【22】 The habitat of any given species is considered its preferred area or territory.  Many processes associated human habitation of an area cause loss of this area and the decrease the carrying capacity of the land for that species.  In many cases these changes in land use cause a patchy break-up of the wild landscape.  Agricultural land frequently displays this type of extremely fragmented, or relictual, habitat.  Farms sprawl across the landscape with patches of uncleared woodland or forest dotted in-between occasional paddocks.\n【23】 Examples of habitat destruction include grazing of bushland by farmed animals, changes to natural fire regimes, forest clearing for timber production and wetland draining for city expansion.\n【24】 ## Impact of introduced species\n【25】 Rats, cats, rabbits, dandelions and poison ivy are all examples of species that have become invasive threats to wild species in various parts of the world.  Frequently species that are uncommon in their home range become out of control invasions in distant but similar climates.  The reasons for this have not always been clear and Charles Darwin felt it was unlikely that exotic species would ever be able to grow abundantly in a place they had not evolved in.  The reality is that the vast majority of species exposed to a new habitat do not reproduce successfully.  However occasionally some populations do take hold and after a period of acclimation can increase in numbers significantly having destructive effects on many elements of the native environment they have become part of.\n【26】 ## Chains of extinction\n【27】 This final group is one of secondary effects.  All wild populations of living things have many complex intertwining links with other living things around them.  Large herbivorous animals such as the hippopotamus have populations of insectivorous birds that feed off the many parasitic insects that grow on the hippo. Should the hippo die out so to will these groups of birds, leading to further destruction as other species dependant on the birds are affected.  Also referred to as a Domino effect, this series of chain reactions is by far the most destructive process that can occur in any ecological community.", "title": "Wildlife", "tags": "", "lang": "", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"id\": \"af2eb0ba618186598b5abf8c6ca2168c0a292ef4\", \"source\": \"wikidoc\", \"url\": \"https://www.wikidoc.org/index.php/Wildlife\", \"overview\": \"None\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-01-28 23:08:00", "update_time": "2024-02-01 00:09:47"}

Also many insects use decayed matter as a protein source, e.g. some bee species or dung beetles.\n【4】 With regard to carrion from the same species, the behavior is also referred to as anthropophagy, in the case of humans, or cannibalism, in the case of other non-human animals.\n【5】 In humans, necrophagy is a taboo in most societies. In the Qur'an slanderers are stigmatized as those who eat the flesh of the dead body of the person they slander. The Aghori, a Hindu sect known to live in graveyards, according to a Persian source and nineteenth century British accounts, were necrophagous.

If not removed regularly, it can lead to dental cavities (caries) or periodontal problems (such as gingivitis).\n【3】 The microorganisms that form the biofilm are almost entirely bacteria (mainly streptococcus mutans and anaerobes), with the composition varying by location in the mouth. Examples of such anaerobes include fusobacterium and Actinobacteria.\n【4】 The microorganisms present in dental plaque are all naturally present in the oral cavity, and are normally harmless. However, failure to remove plaque by regular toothbrushing means that they are allowed to build up in a thick layer. Those microorganisms nearest the tooth surface convert to anaerobic respiration; it is in this state that they start to produce acids which consequently lead to demineralization of the adjacent tooth surface, and dental caries. Saliva is also unable to penetrate the build up of plaque and thus cannot act to neutralize the acid produced by the bacteria and remineralize the tooth surface.\n【5】 Plaque build up can also become mineralized and form calculus.\n【6】 # Prevention and treatment\n【7】 Frequency of brushing and flossing with good technique is important, because the nature (i.e. composition) of the microorganisms change as the plaque ages. Therefore, plaque which is 12 hours old for example is much less damaging than plaque which has not been removed in days.\n【8】 Oral hygiene practices have evolved largely during the time they have been most needed, i.e. the 20th and 21st centuries. The sudden increase in tooth decay is almost certainly attributable to changes in diet, such as the introduction of refined sugar and, later, candy. Presumably, teeth used for the processing of a natural diet (raw meat, fresh vegetables) would last a full lifetime.\n【9】 Mouthwash (also mouth rinse) is used for oral hygiene.

The theme, \"Second-Hand Smoke Kills-Let's Clear the Air,\" was designated by the World Health Organization (WHO) to raise awareness of the hazards of exposure to second-hand smoke. Tobacco use worldwide will cause an estimated 10 million deaths annually by 2030 (1 ). An effective strategy to promote and encourage tobacco-free policies is to link them with sporting events. Such policies also reduce nonsmokers' exposure to second-hand smoke (2 ). The 1988 Olympic Winter Games in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, was the first tobacco-free Olympics. Since then, all of the Olympic Games have had tobacco-free policies (3 ). For the 2002 games, the Olympic organizing committee for Salt Lake City, Utah, will implement a public information campaign using Olympic athletes to promote healthy lifestyles and sports as an alternative to tobacco use. Plans also include information to increase awareness of the tobacco-free policy among visitors, media, athletes, and officials from participating countries. Another media campaign is \"Tobacco Kills-Don't Be Duped,\" which aims to ban tobacco advertising and promotion at sporting events globally.

Asked of respondents who visited a dentist during the year preceding the survey. Editorial Note: The results of the 1996 and 1999 Arizona ATS indicate that the prevalence of cigarette use among Arizona adults decreased substantially following the implementation of the statewide Arizona TEPP. The decrease in smoking prevalence among low income and low education groups also indicates a narrowing in disparities in cigarette use.\n【4】 TEPP directed many of its activities toward Hispanics, which may, in part, explain the substantial decrease in cigarette smoking in that population. TEPP serves the Hispanic population through its Spanish language statewide media campaign and telephone helpline and through local cessation and prevention services. TEPP uses methods appropriate for this population, including Promotoras de Salud (lay health workers) and culturally appropriate materials and curricula.\n【5】 The Arizona ATS results also showed a substantial increase in the proportion of smokers who reported that either a health-care provider or a dentist both asked about tobacco use and advised them to quit. Health-care providers can play a key role in assisting MMWR 405\n【6】 Tobacco Use Among Adults -Continued patients to quit smoking (2 ), and brief physician advice substantially increases successful quitting (2 ). TEPP, through statewide and local projects, provides training for healthcare providers to increase the number of patients with whom they briefly discuss stopping smoking. The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, it is difficult to separate the effects of TEPP from price increases. The cigarette tax in Arizona increased from $0.18 to $0.58 per pack in November 1994, which may have contributed to the decline in adult smoking prevalence. Although the tax increase occurred more than a year before the first survey, the average retail price of cigarettes in Arizona continued to increase from $2.08 in 1996 to $2.50 in 1999 (3 ). Second, some segments of the population in Arizona, including some low income residents, are more likely than others to lack telephone service and therefore not be included in the study sample. Third, the response rate in 1999 was almost nine percentage points lower than the response rate in 1996, which may have influenced the results. Fourth, health-care provider communication data about smoking was based on self-reported recall for an entire year; the validity of these self-reports was not determined. Finally, although declines in smoking rates in Arizona may be a result of TEPP, a cause-and-effect relation cannot be established by comparing data from the cross-sectional ATS surveys alone. Comparing Arizona smoking prevalence trends and trends in other states with varying levels of interventions during 1996-1999 could help to determine how much of the decline may be related to the Arizona TEPP rather than to regional or national influences.\n【7】 Arizona is one of seven states that meet CDC's funding recommendations for FY 2001 (4,5 ). The Arizona TEPP incorporates all nine components of a comprehensive tobaccocontrol program as recommended by CDC (4 ). The program added a certification program for smoking cessation counselors. The Arizona TEPP has been implementing strategies recommended in the Surgeon General's report Reducing Tobacco Use (6 ), CDC's Best Practices for Comprehensive Tobacco Control Programs (4 ), the Clinical Practice Guidelines for Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence (2 ), and the Task Force on Community Preventive Services (7 ). The findings of the 1996 and 1999 Arizona ATS suggest that an adequately funded and comprehensive program can substantially reduce tobacco use overall and across diverse demographic groups. Recent reports from California indicate that sustaining such a program for at least 9 years also could result in reductions in lung and bronchial cancer and coronary heart disease rates (8,9 ). Attainment of the 2010 national health objective (10 ) to reduce adult smoking rates to <12% will require similar programs to be implemented across the United States.\n【8】 # MMWR May 25, 2001\n【9】 Tobacco Use Among Adults -Continued\n【10】 # Protracted Outbreaks of Cryptosporidiosis Associated With Swimming Pool Use -Ohio and Nebraska, 2000\n【11】 Swimming is the second most popular exercise in the United States with approximately 400 million pool visits annually (1 ). During the summer of 2000, five outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis linked to swimming pools were reported to CDC. This report summarizes the investigations of two of these outbreaks involving approximately 1000 cases and provides recommendations to reduce the transmission of pool-related disease.\n【12】 # Ohio\n【13】 In July 2000, the Delaware City/County Health Department (DCCHD) learned of several laboratory-confirmed cases of cryptosporidiosis potentially linked to a private swim club. To determine associated exposures, DCCHD, in collaboration with the Ohio State Health Department and CDC, conducted an investigation.\n【14】 A descriptive study and two telephone-based case-control studies were conducted: a community-based study to examine potential sources of the outbreak and a swim clubbased study to identify club-related risk factors. Persons were asked about source of drinking water, recent travel, visits to pools and lakes, swimming behaviors, contact with ill persons or young animals, and day care attendance.\n【15】 A clinical case was defined as diarrhea (three loose stools during a 24-hour period) in a person for at least 1 day. A laboratory-confirmed case was defined as diarrhea, vomiting, or abdominal cramps in a person and a stool specimen that tested positive for Cryptosporidium parvum. All case-patients were in central Ohio during June 17-August 18. Case-patients and controls were frequency matched by age. DCCHD identified 700 clinical cases among residents of Delaware County and three neighboring counties. The outbreak began in late June and continued through September (Figure 1). The club closed during July 28-August 4. Of 268 stool samples submitted to DCCHD, 186 (70%) tested positive for Cryptosporidium; 47 laboratory-confirmed casepatients were enrolled in the two case-control studies. The median age of these casepatients was 6 years (range: 1-46 years) and 28 (61%) were female. The median duration of illness was 7 days (range: 1-36 days). Symptoms included diarrhea (91%), loss of appetite (87%), abdominal cramps (83%), and vomiting (35%). Nearly half (45%) reported intermittent diarrhea. Swimming at the private club was strongly associated with illness in the community case-control study. Of the 47 case-patients, 40 (93.6%) went swimming in the pool, compared with 24 (55%) of 44 controls (odds ratio =42.3; 95% confidence interval =12. 3-144.9). In the club-based case-control study, activities that increased the risk for pool water getting in the mouth (e.g., standing under a pool sprinkler) increased the risk for illness (OR=8.4; 95% CI=1.8-54.8). At least five fecal accidents, one of which was diarrheal, were observed.\n【16】 # Nebraska\n【17】 In August 2000, the Douglas County Health Department, Nebraska, detected an increase in laboratory-reported cases of cryptosporidiosis. Initial cases were linked to a private club with swimming facilities (club A). Additional case-patients reported swimming at club A, at another nearby private club (club B), or at other local pools. The pools at clubs A and B subsequently closed for 2 weeks in mid-August.\n【18】 A case-control study was conducted at club A to identify community and club-specific risk factors. A clinical case was defined as diarrhea (three loose stools during a 24-hour period) in a person who was a member of club A. A laboratory-confirmed case was defined as diarrhea, vomiting, or cramps in a person who had a stool specimen that tested positive for Cryptosporidium. All case-patients were in the Douglas County area during June 3-September 28. Members of club A with laboratory-confirmed or clinical cases of cryptosporidiosis were enrolled in the study. Controls were randomly selected from the club A membership list and frequency matched by age.\n【19】 The outbreak began in mid-June, peaked in mid-August, and tapered off in September, coinciding with the end of the outdoor swimming season in Nebraska (Figure 2 Symptoms included diarrhea (94%), abdominal cramps (83%), loss of appetite (74%), nausea (60%), and vomiting (43%). The median duration of diarrhea was 7 days (range: 1-44 days), and nearly half (46%) of patients reported intermittent diarrhea. Thirty-seven case-patients and 36 controls were included in the case-control study at club A. Illness was associated with swimming at club A (OR=5.0; 95% CI=1.48-17.7) and having been splashed with pool water (OR=5.3; 95% CI=1.6-18.9).\n【20】 Swimmers often swam at multiple pool facilities and swim/dive team meets were held at both clubs A and B. Approximately 18% of the case-patients reported swimming while symptomatic, and nearly one third (32%) swam either during illness or during the 2-week period after symptoms subsided. Fecal accidents were observed at both clubs. Editorial Note: Outbreaks of gastrointestinal illness associated with treated recreational water (e.g., swimming pools) appear to have increased in recent years with most being caused by Cryptosporidium (2,3 ). Although a fecal accident by a swimmer can expose other swimmers to various disease-causing organisms, the probability of transmission of cryptosporidiosis is higher in this setting for two reasons. First, Cryptosporidium oocysts are extremely resistant to chlorine and may remain infective for several days in swimming pool water containing recommended chlorine concentrations (4 ) and, because of their small size, may not be removed efficiently by conventional pool filters. Second, the high titer of Cryptosporidium in diarrhea from infected persons (5 ) and the low  6) make it possible for a single fecal accident to sufficiently contaminate an entire pool such that accidental ingestion of a few mouthfuls of water can result in infection.\n【21】 The protracted nature of these two outbreaks highlights the challenges faced by health departments and pool managers in detecting and controlling pool-associated cryptosporidiosis outbreaks. The outbreaks went unreported for several weeks, possibly because ill persons often do not seek health care for diarrheal illness (U.S. Department of Agriculture, unpublished data, 1997). During this time, ill persons continued to swim, increasing the likelihood that contamination of the pools continued to occur. It is unclear whether extended pool closure reduced the potential for exposure or contributed to transmission at other pools. A multicomponent approach to outbreak prevention is needed that combines education of swimmers and pool staff, pool design modifications, and improved operations and maintenance procedures.\n【22】 The high incidence of diarrhea in the United States (7 ) and the continued use of the pools during illness suggest that education of the public is an important component of any prevention strategy. To reduce pool contamination and the spread of cryptosporidiosis and other diarrheal illnesses, public health officials and pool managers should educate staff and patrons about key messages that may reduce recreational water illness transmission. To prevent transmission, persons with diarrhea should not swim, swimmers should avoid swallowing pool water, and persons should practice good hygiene before swimming, after using the restroom, and after changing a diaper.\n【23】 Improved design and management of pools also may reduce the risk for disease transmission. Public health officials and pool operators should consider 1) using separate filtration systems for \"kiddie\" pools and other pools to decrease the potential for cross-contamination; 2) optimizing filtration rates of kiddie pools without facilitating suction injuries to decrease the length of time that swimmers would be exposed to pathogens; and 3) ensuring that restrooms and diaper changing areas are close to the pool and are clean and adequate in number. Management practices should 1) reinforce that pool operators regularly maintain and monitor pH and free residual chlorine levels to help prevent transmission of most waterborne pathogens; 2) develop policies for pool disinfection following a fecal accident (8,9 ); 3) train staff about prevention of recreational water illness transmission; and 4) institute frequent restroom breaks for young swimmers to reduce the potential for fecal accidents.\n【24】 During a pool-associated or other local outbreak of cryptosporidiosis, extra vigilance is necessary to prevent swimming-related disease transmission. Those at risk for serious illness (e.g., immunocompromised persons) should consider not swimming during an outbreak. In addition, because persons ill with cryptosporidiosis often have intermittent diarrhea and Cryptosporidium can be excreted for several weeks after diarrhea subsides (10 ), ill swimmers should refrain from swimming while ill with diarrhea and should also not swim for a 2-week period after cessation of diarrhea. Operators of implicated pools should intensify education efforts and consider prohibiting diaper-and toddleraged children from swimming during the outbreak. In addition, health officials should alert pool operators in the geographic area so they can undertake intensive education efforts to prevent infected persons from swimming in and potentially contaminating their pools. Further evaluation is needed to determine the efficacy of extended pool closures on preventing Cryptosporidium transmission. Additional information about prevention of recreational water illness is available at .\n【25】 # Prevalence of Parasites in Fecal Material from Chlorinated Swimming Pools -United States, 1999\n【26】 As a result of the 1998 outbreak of infection with the chlorine-sensitive pathogen Escherichia coli O157:H7 at a waterpark in Georgia (1 ), many public health departments updated their guidelines for disinfecting pools following a fecal accident. Many of these guidelines recommended treating all fecal accidents as if they contained the highly chlorine-resistant parasite Cryptosporidium parvum (2 ), generally resulting in hyperchlorination and pool closures of up to a day. To determine whether fecal accidents commonly contained Cryptosporidium, the prevalence of this parasite and the moderately chlorine sensitive parasite Giardia intestinalis (3 ) was assessed by asking swimming pool operators throughout the United States to collect formed stools from fecal accidents in their pools. This report summarizes the results of this study and provides recommendations for disinfecting pools following fecal accidents.\n【27】 During 1999, 47 swimming pools, waterparks, or aquatics centers were enrolled in the survey by telephone. Sample collection began Memorial Day weekend (May 29) and ended after Labor Day weekend (September 6). Samples of each fecal accident were collected into vials containing 10% formalin. Labels included no pool-specific identifiers. Samples were tested for Cryptosporidiumand Giardia-specific stool antigen without prior concentration. All positive specimens were verified using an immunofluorescent antibody mixture specific to Cryptosporidium and Giardia followed by microscopic identification.\n【28】 # Parasites in Chlorinated Swimming Pools -Continued\n【29】 None of 293 formed stools from fecal accidents collected by pool operators contained Cryptosporidium. Giardia was found in 13 (4.4%) of the samples. Because this study addressed parasite prevalence in only formed stool, no information relating to disinfection procedures for diarrheal fecal accidents was obtained. Editorial Note: During the 1990s, reports of outbreaks of gastrointestinal disease associated with the use of disinfected recreational water (i.e., swimming and wading pools, waterparks, fountains, hot tubs, and spas) have gradually increased (4 ). During 1989-1998, approximately 10,000 cases of diarrheal illness were associated with 32 recreational waterborne disease outbreaks in disinfected water venues in the United States. Ten outbreaks occurred during 1997-1998, the highest number of recreational water outbreaks ever reported (4 ). Because diarrheal illness is underreported to public health authorities, the number of outbreaks associated with recreational water use is probably higher (5 ). The number of swimming exposures in the United States (approximately 400 million annual visits) (6 ) and increasing attendance at high capacity recreational water venues provide strong incentives to review and improve recommendations to reduce the transmission of gastrointestinal illness resulting from recreational water use.\n【30】 Because swimming typically involves sharing water with many other persons in a pool, the water contains various bodily fluids, fecal matter, dirt, and debris that wash off bodies during swimming activities. Fecal matter is regularly introduced into the water when someone has a fecal accident through release of formed stool or diarrhea into the water, or residual fecal material on swimmers' bodies is washed into the pool. Fecal contamination may be more likely to occur when there is a high density of bathers, particularly diaper-and toddler-aged children. Swallowing this fecally contaminated water is the primary mode for transmission of enteric pathogens in recreational water outbreaks.\n【31】 Although chlorine is an effective disinfectant, it does not instantly kill all pathogens (7 ). In addition, some pathogens, such as the parasite Cryptosporidium, are highly resistant to chlorine concentrations routinely used in pools (2 ). Because of frequent fecal contamination, the inability of chlorine disinfection to rapidly inactivate several pathogens and the common occurrence of accidental ingestion of pool water, transmission of pathogens can occur even in well-maintained pools.\n【32】 The low prevalence of Cryptosporidium in formed fecal accidents in this study indicates that regulators can adopt less stringent disinfection guidelines by disinfecting pool water as if it contained the moderately chlorine-resistant parasite Giardia. Although there is a large differential between inactivation times for Cryptosporidium, Giardia, and E. coli (approximately 7 days, <1 hour, and <1 minute, respectively, at 1 mg/L free available chlorine ), responding to formed fecal accidents with water treatment sufficient to inactivate Giardia also should be sufficient to inactivate other known viral and bacterial waterborne pathogens, including E. coli O157:H7 (8 ).\n【33】 On the basis of these findings, CDC has prepared recommendations for responding to fecal accidents in disinfected recreational water venues (see Notice to Readers, page ). These recommendations assume the presence of Giardia in formed stool accidents and the presence of Cryptosporidium in diarrheal accidents. The prevalence of Cryptosporidium in diarrhetic and nondiarrhetic stools requires further investigation.\n【34】 The Giardia inactivation guidelines are based on data developed by the Environmental Protection Agency for disinfection of Giardia in drinking water (9 ). Pool operators should consult with their local or state health authorities for specific fecal accident disinfection procedures. These recommendations are intended to minimize infectious disease transmission by observed fecal accidents (primarily formed stool); however, the unique circulation patterns found in pools often result in areas of poor pool circulation (i.e., \"dead spots\") making it unlikely that disease transmission can be fully prevented. In addition, the higher risk associated with diarrheal accidents, which may rarely be observed and/or responded to, makes it important that public health professionals and the aquatics industry address other critical recreational water illness prevention components. These may include improving aquatics industry policies, planning, and practices and educating aquatics staff and patrons about the potential for recreational water illness transmission. Swimmers should be informed by public health professionals and the aquatics industry that healthy swimming practices necessitate that patrons refrain from swimming while ill with diarrhea and avoid swallowing pool water. Improved hygiene before and during swimming (e.g., showering, handwashing, frequent restroom breaks for young children, and appropriate diaper changing) also should be promoted.

In 1998, the fatality rate from drowning for Louisiana residents was 3.1 per 100,000 population, higher than the U.S. rate of 1.9 per 100,000, and more than twice the 2000 national target of 1.3 per 100,000 population. This report describes the demographics and risk factors associated with drownings in Louisiana in 1998. Findings indicate that alcohol or illicit drug use was found in approximately 60% of tested victims aged >13 years and that none of the victims of boating-related drowning were correctly wearing a personal flotation device (PFD). Prevention efforts should focus on decreasing alcohol and illicit drug use and increasing the proper use of PFDs among boaters and others involved in water recreation.\n【37】 The Louisiana Office of Public Health examined three sources of data on persons who died by drowning: 1998 death certificates, coroners' records, and records of investigations performed by the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries (LDWF). A case was defined as death in a resident of Louisiana coded on the death certificate as having drowned in the state during 1998. Using death certificates, 137 cases were identified. Of these, 114 investigative reports were reviewed: 96 with coroners' records, six with LDWF reports, and 12 with both; investigative reports for 23 (17%) cases could not be obtained. In addition, modifiable risk factors were analyzed. Alcohol and illicit drug use were examined in the deaths of persons aged >13 years. Use was determined by the presence of ethanol or metabolites of illicit drugs in samples collected at autopsy. Among deaths that occurred in a swimming pool, pool fencing was described as present or absent, and PFD use was recorded for investigative reports of boating-related drowning.\n【38】 Of the 137 drowning cases, 115 (84%) occurred among males. Blacks and whites died in almost equal numbers, 68 (50%) and 67 (49%), respectively; however, the rate of drowning among blacks was more than twice the rate of whites, 4.8 per 100,000 and 2.3 per 100,000, respectively. The median age of drowned persons was 32 years (range: 10 months-94 years). The highest drowning rate was among persons aged 25-35 years (3.8 per 100,000). Children aged <4 years accounted for 10% of the total deaths and had the second highest rate (3.5 per 100,000). Among those cases in which the manner of death could be determined, 122 (95%) were classified as \"accident\" (unintentional); seven (5%) were classified as suicide. Twelve (9%) drowning deaths were work-related.\n【39】 Of 114 deaths with coroner or LDWF records, 83 (73%) occurred in natural bodies of water (e.g., lakes, bayous, rivers, and the Gulf of Mexico), 19 (17%) in swimming pools, and seven (6%) in bathtubs or hot tubs. Four deaths were classified to have occurred in an \"other setting\" and in one death the setting was unknown. Alcohol testing was recorded in 72 (76%) of the 94 decedents aged >13 years; 43 (60%) had evidence for the presence of alcohol and/or illicit drugs. Thirteen (30%) decedents were positive for alcohol and illicit drugs, 28 (67%) were positive for alcohol, and one (2%) was positive for illicit drugs.\n【40】 Among the 19 deaths that occurred in a swimming pool, 11 (58%) were in children aged <14 years. Children aged <4 years died in swimming pools at the highest rate (1.3 per 100,000). The presence or absence of fences was noted in eight (42%) deaths. Six pools had and two did not have fencing. May 25, 2001\n【41】 # Drowning -Continued\n【42】 Coroner and LDWF reports indicated that 35 (31%) of 114 deaths occurred during boating-related activities: 11 (31%) involved a fall from the boat, seven (20%) occurred when the boat capsized, and six (17%) involved a collision. Five (14%) persons who drowned had entered the water voluntarily, and six (17%) had entered the water for unknown reasons. PFD use was recorded for 22 (63%) boating-related drownings; only one decedent had been wearing a PFD and it was unfastened. Among persons aged >13 years, 34 drownings occurred; 13 (48%) tested positive for alcohol or illicit drugs. Editorial Note: The circumstances of drowning identified in this report highlight ways to prevent drowning deaths. Drowning in Louisiana occurred most often in natural bodies of water. Approximately 30% of the deaths during 1998 were associated with boating, which is proportionately more than in the entire United States, where boating accounts for 20% of drowning (1 ). In this investigation, the findings indicated that alcohol or illicit drug use was present in nearly half of the tested boating-related deaths among persons aged >13 years, that none of the boating-related decedents had been wearing a PFD correctly, and that during 1998, drowning in swimming pools accounted for 17% of deaths, with children aged <4 years at highest risk. Louisiana state regulations pertaining to alcohol use focus only on boat operators, and state regulations on wearing PFD pertain only to children aged <13 years.\n【43】 The findings in this report are subject to at least two limitations. First, some investigative reports were not available. Second, risk factor information was missing in many of the reports that were examined. Both of these limitations could effect the reported prevalence of risk behaviors.\n【44】 By analyzing the state-level data described in this report, the Louisiana Office of Public Health determined that drowning prevention efforts should include: 1) decreasing alcohol and illicit drug use among both boating passengers and operators; 2) focusing on the proper use of PFDs not only among children but among persons of all ages; and 3) instructing caretakers to supervise children and maintain adequate fencing around swimming pools (2 ). For a pool fence to protect against drowning, the fence must completely enclose the pool and must be at least 4 feet high with vertical openings <4 inches wide and with a functional self-latching gate (3 ). All of these prevention efforts need to be delivered in a manner culturally appropriate for the highest risk populations.\n【45】 # Notice to Readers\n【46】 # National Safe Boating Week -May 19-25, 2001\n【47】 National Safe Boating Week is May 19-25, 2001. Boating safety improved in the United States throughout the 1990s. Despite a 15% increase in boats registered, the boating fatality rate declined 32% from 1990 to 1999. However, boating-related deaths continue to occur. In 1999, 734 persons died in boating incidents. Boaters routinely should adopt safety practices.\n【48】 All boaters should wear personal flotation devices (PFDs). Capsizing and falling overboard account for more than half of all recreational boating deaths each year (1 ). Although all states and territories (except Guam, Hawaii, and Idaho) have regulations on wearing life jackets, most affect only children aged <12 years.\n【49】 Boaters should avoid alcoholic beverages while boating. Alcohol use affects judgment, vision, balance, and coordination. Approximately one third of all deaths caused by a collision involved alcohol use.\n【50】 Boaters should be aware of the risk for carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning. Potential sources of CO poisoning include using air conditioning powered by an onboard motor generator, operating a gasoline powered engine while docked and/or rafted with other boats operating engines, or being underway with improper cabin ventilation. To avoid CO poisoning, boaters should have sufficient ventilation, properly install and maintain equipment, and use CO detectors.\n【51】 Boaters should be aware of potential hazards and the regulations of operating a boat. Boating education courses teach the regulatory and statutory rules for safely operating and navigating recreational boats. The U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary and U.S. Power Squadron offer the Vessel Safety Check (VSC) program to promote boating safety. Volunteers check safety equipment and provide information about equipment purpose, safety procedures, and applicable regulations.\n【52】 Additional\n【53】 # MMWR May 25, 2001\n【54】 Notice to Readers -Continued\n【55】 # Notice to Readers\n【56】 # Responding to Fecal Accidents in Disinfected Swimming Venues\n【57】 These recommendations are solely for management of fecal accidents in disinfected recreational water venues. The recommendations do not address use of other nonchlorine disinfectants because there is limited pathogen inactivation data for many of these compounds. Because improper handling of chlorinated disinfectants could cause injury, appropriate occupational safety and health requirements should be followed.\n【58】 A. Formed stool (solid, nonliquid)\n【59】 1. Direct everyone to leave all pools into which water containing the feces is circulated. Do not allow anyone to enter the contaminated pool(s) until all decontamination procedures are completed.\n【60】 2. Remove as much of the fecal material as possible using a net or scoop and dispose of it in a sanitary manner. Clean and disinfect the net or scoop (e.g., after cleaning, leave the net or scoop immersed in the pool during disinfection). Vacuuming stool from the pool is not recommended*.\n【61】 3. Raise the free available chlorine concentration to 2 mg/L, pH 7.2-7.5, if it is <2.0 mg/L. Ensure this concentration is found throughout all co-circulating pools by sampling at least three widely spaced locations away from return water outlets. This free available chlorine concentration was selected to keep the pool closure time to approximately 30 minutes. Other concentrations or closure times can be used as long as the CT inactivation value † is kept constant (Table 1).\n【62】 4. Maintain the free available chlorine concentration at 2.0 mg/L, pH 7.2-7.5, for at least 25 minutes before reopening the pool. State or local regulators may require higher free available chlorine levels in the presence of chlorine stabilizers such as chlorinated isocyanurates § . Ensure that the filtration system is operating while the pool reaches and maintains the proper free available chlorine concentration during the disinfection process.\n【63】 5. Establish a fecal accident log. Document each fecal accident by recording date and time of the event, formed stool or diarrhea, free available chlorine concentration at the time or observation of the event and before opening the pool, the pH, the procedures followed to respond to the fecal accident (including the process used to increase free chlorine residual if necessary), and the contact time.\n【64】 # B. Diarrhea (liquid stool)\n【65】 1. See A1.\n【66】 2. See A2.\n【67】 3. Raise the free available chlorine concentration to 20 mg/L ¶ and maintain the pH between 7.2 and 7.5. Ensure this concentration is found throughout all co-circulating pools by sampling at least three widely spaced locations away from return water outlets. This chlorine and pH level should be sufficient to inactivate Cryptosporidium and should be maintained for at least 8 hours, equivalent to a CT inactivation value of 9600. A higher or lower free available chlorine level/inactivation time can be used as long as a CT inactivation value equaling 9600 is maintained for Cryptosporidium inactivation. State or local regulators may require higher free available chlorine levels in the presence of chlorine stabilizers such as chlorinated isocyanurates. If necessary, consult an aquatics professional to determine and identify the feasibility, practical methods, and safety considerations before attempting the hyperchlorination of any pool.\n【68】 4. Ensure that the filtration system is operating while the pool reaches and maintains the proper free available chlorine concentration during disinfection.\n【69】 5. Backwash the filter thoroughly after reaching the CT value. Be sure the effluent is discharged directly to waste and in accordance with state or local regulations. Do not return the backwash through the filter. Where appropriate, replace the filter media.\n【70】 6. Swimmers may be allowed into the pool after the required CT value has been achieved and the free available chlorine level has been returned to the normal operating range allowed - No uniform recommendations for disinfection of vacuum systems are available. However, if a vacuum system is accidentally used, the waste should be discharged directly to a sewer or other approved waste disposal system and not through the filtration system. The dilution effect of the pool water going through the hose may reduce the risk for high-level contamination of the vacuum system. † CT refers to concentration (C) of free available chlorine in mg/L or ppm multiplied by time (T) in minutes. If pool operators want to use a different chlorine concentration or inactivation time, they need to ensure that CT values always remain the same. For example, if an operator finds a formed fecal accident in the pool and his pool has a free available chlorine reading of 3 mg/L and a pH of 7.5, to determine how long the pool should be closed to swimmers, locate 3 mg/L in the left column of the table and then move right and read the pool closure time. The pool should be closed for 19 minutes. Example 2: The CT inactivation value for Cryptosporidium is 9600, which equals (20 mg/L)(480 minutes) (i.e., 8 hours). After a diarrheal accident in the pool, an operator determines she can only maintain 15 mg/L. How long would hyperchlorination take? Answer: 9600=CT=;T=9600/15=640 minutes=10.7 hours. § The impact of chlorine stabilizers (e.g., chlorinated isocyanurates) on pathogen inactivation and disinfectant measurement is unclear and requires further investigation. State or local regulations on chlorinated isocyanurates use should be consulted. ¶ Many conventional test kits cannot measure free available chlorine levels this high. Use chlorine test strips that can measure free available chlorine in a range that includes 20mg/L (such as those used in the food industry) or make dilutions for use in a standard DPD (N, N-diethyl-p-phenylenediamine) test kit using chlorine-free water. May 25, 2001\n【71】 Notice to Readers -Continued\n【72】 # Notice to Readers\n【73】 # Deferral of Routine Booster Doses of Tetanus and Diphtheria Toxoids for Adolescents and Adults\n【74】 A shortage of tetanus and diphtheria toxoids (Td) and tetanus toxoid (TT) in the United States has resulted because one of two manufacturers discontinued production of tetanus toxoid-containing products (1 ). Aventis Pasteur (Swiftwater, Pennsylvania) is the only major manufacturer of tetanus and Td in the United States. In response to the shortage, Aventis Pasteur has increased production of Td to meet national needs; however, because 11 months are required for vaccine production, the shortage is expected to last for the remainder of 2001.\n【75】 To assure vaccine availability for priority indications (2 ), all routine Td boosters in adolescents and adults should be delayed until 2002. Td use should follow existing recommendations for all other indications, which include 1) persons traveling to a country where the risk for diphtheria is high*; 2) persons requiring tetanus vaccination for prophylaxis in wound management; 3) persons who have received <3 doses of any vaccine containing Td; and 4) pregnant women who have not been vaccinated with Td during the preceding 10 years.\n【76】 CDC recommends that health-care providers, including clinic personnel, record the names of patients whose booster dose is delayed during the shortage. When Td supplies are restored, these patients should be notified to return to their health-care provider for vaccination. According to Aventis Pasteur, sufficient vaccine will be available in early 2002 to supply the national demand.\n【77】 Health-care providers using Td for wound management should follow recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices for wound management (3 ). All wound patients should receive Td if they have received 3 doses of TT-containing vaccine and severe or contaminated wounds, Td should be given only if >5 years have passed since the last dose of tetanuscontaining vaccine. For clean and minor wounds, Td should be given only if the patient has not received a tetanus-containing vaccine during the preceding 10 years. Healthcare providers should inquire from patients presenting for wound management about the timing of their last tetanus-containing vaccine to avoid unnecessary vaccination.\n【78】 Pediatric formulations of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids (DT) and diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP) should not be used for persons aged >7 years. Although TT might be considered a substitute for Td in wound management      Because of changes in reporting methods in this Pennsylvania city, these numbers are partial counts for the current week. Complete counts will be available in 4 to 6 weeks. ¶ Total includes unknown ages.\n【79】 # Contributors to the Production of the MMWR (Weekly)\n【80】 Weekly\n【81】 when Td is not available, TT is not available for national distribution. Existing stocks of TT are extremely limited and are mainly reserved for production of tetanus immune globulin and other special circumstances. Health-care providers and institutions requiring Td for priority indications should contact Aventis Pasteur, telephone (800) 822-2463 or (800) VACCINE.

There, she and the midwives of the Farm created one of the first out-of-hospital birth centers in the United States. Standards of birthing at the Farm are modeled to the recommendations of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Several family members and friends are commonly in attendance and are encouraged to take an active role in the birth.\n【3】 # Significance of her work\n【4】 According to Carol Lorente (1995), the work of Gaskin and the midwives might not have had the impact it did, if it hadn't been for the publication of her book Spiritual Midwifery (1977):\n【5】 Gaskin has been attributed with the emergence and popularization of direct-entry midwifery in the United States since the early 1970s.  She is publisher of the periodical Birth Gazette and an internationally-known speaker on maternity care issues for the Midwives Alliance of North America (MANA), and has appeared at both the Starwood Festival and the WinterStar Symposium, discussing the history and importance of midwifery.\n【6】 She is also the founder of the Safe Motherhood Quilt Project. The Safe Motherhood Quilt Project is a national effort developed to draw public attention to the current maternal death rates and to honor those women who have died of pregnancy-related causes during the past twenty years.\n【7】 Gaskin's Ina May's Guide to Childbirth was published in 2003.\n【8】 # Outcomes\n【9】 A study of home births assisted by the midwives of The Farm, (Durand, (1992) looked at the outcomes of 1707 women who received care in rural Tennessee between 1971 and 1989.  These births were compared to outcomes of over 14,000 physician-attended hospital births in 1980.  Comparing perinatal deaths, labor complications, and use of assisted delivery, the study found that \"under certain circumstances, home births attended by lay midwives can be accomplished as safely as, and with less intervention than, physician-attended hospital deliveries.\"\n【10】 # Recognition\n【11】 Ina May Gaskin has lectured at midwifery conferences and medical schools all over the world. She served as President of Midwives' Alliance of North America from 1996 to 2002. She is the recipient of the ASPO/Lamaze Irwin Chabon Award (1997), and the Tennessee Perinatal Association Recognition Award. Also in 1997, she was made a Visiting Fellow of Morse College, Yale University.\n【12】 # Bibliography\n【13】 - 1987 - Babies, Breastfeeding & Bonding (Bergin & Garvey Publishers) ISBN 0-89789-134-1\n【14】 - 2002 - Spiritual Midwifery (The Book Publishing Company) ISBN 1-57067-104-4 (1st edition 1977)\n【15】 - 2003 - Ina May's Guide to Childbirth (Bantam) ISBN 0-553-38115-6\n【16】 # Articles\n【17】 - \"Induced and Seduced: The Dangers of Cytotec.\" Mothering.

There is a Black Box Warning for this drug as shown here.  Common adverse reactions include anemia, fatigue, hemorrhage, febrile neutropenia, musculoskeletal pain, nausea, edema, thrombocytopenia, dyspnea, decreased appetite, dysgeusia, mucositis, constipation, and rash.\n【6】 # Adult Indications and Dosage\n【7】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Adult)\n【8】 ### ULTOMIRIS is indicated for:\n【9】 DAURISMO is indicated, in combination with low-dose cytarabine, for the treatment of newly-diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in adult patients who are ≥75 years old or who have comorbidities that preclude use of intensive induction chemotherapy.\n【10】 ### Dosage Forms And Strengths\n【11】 - DAURISMO 100 mg tablets: round, pale orange film-coated tablet debossed with \"Pfizer\" on one side and \"GLS 100\" on the other.\n【12】 - DAURISMO 25 mg tablets: round, yellow film-coated tablet debossed with \"Pfizer\" on one side and \"GLS 25\" on the other.\n【13】 - 100 mg orally once daily on days 1 to 28 in combination with cytarabine 20 mg subcutaneously twice daily on days 1 to 10 of each 28-day cycle in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or loss of disease control. For patients without unacceptable toxicity, treat for a minimum of 6 cycles to allow time for clinical response.\n【14】 - Administer DAURISMO with or without food. Do not split or crush DAURISMO tablets. Administer DAURISMO about the same time each day. If a dose of DAURISMO is vomited, do not administer a replacement dose; wait until the next scheduled dose is due. If a dose of DAURISMO is missed or not taken at the usual time, administer the dose as soon as possible and at least 12 hours prior to the next scheduled dose. Return to the normal schedule the following day. Do not administer 2 doses of DAURISMO within 12 hours.\n【15】 - Assess complete blood counts, electrolytes, renal, and hepatic function prior to the initiation of DAURISMO and at least once weekly for the first month.\n【16】 - Monitor electrolytes and renal function once monthly for the duration of therapy.\n【17】 - Obtain serum creatine kinase levels prior to initiating DAURISMO and as indicated clinically thereafter (e.g., if muscle symptoms are reported).\n【18】 - Monitor electrocardiograms (ECGs) prior to the initiation of DAURISMO, approximately one week after initiation, and then once monthly for the next two months to assess for QTc prolongation. Repeat ECG if abnormal.\n【19】 Certain patients may require more frequent and ongoing ECG monitoring.\n【20】 - Certain patients may require more frequent and ongoing ECG monitoring.\n【21】 - Manage any abnormalities promptly\n【22】 ### Dosage Modification for Concomitant Use with Moderate CYP3A4 Inducers\n【23】 - Avoid concomitant use of DAURISMO with moderate CYP3A4 inducers. If concomitant use of moderate CYP3A4 inducers cannot be avoided, increase the DAURISMO dosage as tolerated as shown in Table 2. After the moderate CYP3A4 inducer has been discontinued for 7 days, resume the DAURISMO dose taken prior to initiating the moderate CYP3A4 inducer.\n【24】 ## Off-Label Use and Dosage (Adult)\n【25】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\n【26】 There is limited information regarding DAURISMO Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use and Dosage (Adult) in the drug label.\n【27】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n【28】 There is limited information regarding DAURISMO Off-Label Non-Guideline-Supported Use and Dosage (Adult) in the drug label.\n【29】 # Pediatric Indications and Dosage\n【30】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Pediatric)\n【31】 There is limited information regarding DAURISMO FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Pediatric) in the drug label.\n【32】 ## Off-Label Use and Dosage (Pediatric)\n【33】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\n【34】 There is limited information regarding DAURISMO Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use and Dosage (Pediatric) in the drug label.\n【35】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n【36】 There is limited information regarding DAURISMO Off-Label Non-Guideline-Supported Use and Dosage (Pediatric) in the drug label.\n【37】 # Contraindications\n【38】 None\n【39】 # Warnings\n【40】 ### Embryo-Fetal Toxicity\n【41】 - Based on its mechanism of action and findings from animal embryo-fetal developmental toxicity studies, DAURISMO can cause embryo-fetal death or severe birth defects when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no clinical data on the use of DAURISMO in pregnant women.\n【42】 - In animal embryo-fetal developmental toxicity studies, glasdegib caused embryotoxicity, fetotoxicity and teratogenicity at maternal exposures that were less than the human exposure at the recommended human dose of 100 mg. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus.\n【43】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential\n【44】 DAURISMO is not recommended for use during pregnancy. Conduct pregnancy testing in female patients of reproductive potential prior to initiating DAURISMO treatment. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with DAURISMO and for at least 30 days after the last dose. Advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with DAURISMO and for at least 30 days after the last dose.\n【45】 ### Males\n【46】 Advise male patients with female partners of the potential risk of exposure through semen and to use effective contraception, including a condom, even after vasectomy, to avoid drug exposure to a pregnant partner or a female partner of reproductive potential during treatment with DAURISMO and for at least 30 days after the last dose.\n【47】 ### Blood Donation\n【48】 Advise patients not to donate blood or blood products while taking DAURISMO and for at least 30 days after the last dose of DAURISMO because their blood or blood products might be given to a female of reproductive potential.\n【49】 ### QTc Interval Prolongation\n【50】 - Patients treated with DAURISMO can develop QTc prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias, including ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia.\n【51】 Of the 98 evaluable patients treated with DAURISMO 100 mg in combination with low-dose cytarabine in the clinical trial, 5% were found to have a QTc interval greater than 500 ms and 4% of patients had an increase from baseline QTc greater than 60 ms. The clinical trial excluded patients with baseline QTc of greater than 470 ms or with a history of long QT syndrome or uncontrolled cardiovascular disease.\n【52】 - Of the 98 evaluable patients treated with DAURISMO 100 mg in combination with low-dose cytarabine in the clinical trial, 5% were found to have a QTc interval greater than 500 ms and 4% of patients had an increase from baseline QTc greater than 60 ms. The clinical trial excluded patients with baseline QTc of greater than 470 ms or with a history of long QT syndrome or uncontrolled cardiovascular disease.\n【53】 - Monitor electrocardiograms (ECGs) and electrolytes. Concomitant use of DAURISMO with drugs known to prolong the QTc interval and CYP3A4 inhibitors may increase the risk of QTc interval prolongation. In patients with congenital long QT syndrome, congestive heart failure, electrolyte abnormalities, or those who are taking medications known to prolong the QTc interval, more frequent ECG monitoring is recommended.\n【54】 - Interrupt DAURISMO if QTc increases to greater than 500 ms. Discontinue DAURISMO permanently for patients who develop QTc interval prolongation with signs or symptoms of life-threatening arrhythmia.\n【55】 # Adverse Reactions\n【56】 ## Clinical Trials Experience\n【57】 - The safety profile of DAURISMO is based on experience in the BRIGHT AML 1003 study for 111 adults with newly-diagnosed AML and 14 adults with other conditions for which DAURISMO is not indicated.\n【58】 - Patients were treated with DAURISMO 100 mg daily in combination with low-dose cytarabine (N=84) or low-dose cytarabine alone (N=41).\n【59】 - The median duration of treatment in the DAURISMO with low-dose cytarabine arm was 83 days (range 3 to 972 days).\n【60】 - The median duration of treatment in the low-dose cytarabine alone arm was 47 days (range 6 to 239 days).\n【61】 - The median exposure to DAURISMO in the DAURISMO with low-dose cytarabine arm was 76 days (range 3 to 954 days). Thirty-two patients (38%) were treated with DAURISMO with low-dose cytarabine for at least 6 months and 14 patients (17%) were treated for at least 1 year.\n【62】 - Serious adverse reactions were reported in 79% of patients treated in the DAURISMO with low-dose cytarabine arm.\n【63】 The most common (≥5%) serious adverse reactions in patients receiving DAURISMO with low-dose cytarabine were febrile neutropenia (29%), pneumonia (23%), hemorrhage (12%), anemia (7%), and sepsis (7%).\n【64】 - The most common (≥5%) serious adverse reactions in patients receiving DAURISMO with low-dose cytarabine were febrile neutropenia (29%), pneumonia (23%), hemorrhage (12%), anemia (7%), and sepsis (7%).\n【65】 - Dose reductions associated with adverse reactions were reported in 26% of patients treated with DAURISMO with low-dose cytarabine, and the most common reasons (≥2%) for dose reductions due to adverse reactions were muscle spasms (5%), fatigue (4%), febrile neutropenia (4%), anemia (2%), thrombocytopenia (2%), and ECG QT prolonged (2%).\n【66】 - Adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation were reported in 36% of patients treated with DAURISMO with low-dose cytarabine, and the most common (≥2%) reasons for permanent discontinuation were pneumonia (6%), febrile neutropenia (4%), sepsis (4%), sudden death (2%), myocardial infarction (2%), nausea (2%), and renal insufficiency (2%).\n【67】 - The adverse reactions muscle spasms (4 in 12 patients) and decreased appetite (2 in 10 patients) worsened (i.e. progressed from Grades ≤ 2 to Grade 3 or higher) after the first 90 days of therapy in BRIGHT AML 1003.\n【68】 - Additional clinically-significant adverse reactions occurring in < 10% of patients treated with DAURISMO and low-dose cytarabine in BRIGHT AML 1003 include:\n【69】 Dental disorders: loose tooth and toothache\n【70】 Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: alopecia\n【71】 Cardiac disorders: QT interval prolonged\n【72】 - Dental disorders: loose tooth and toothache\n【73】 - Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: alopecia\n【74】 - Cardiac disorders: QT interval prolonged\n【75】 - The following laboratory abnormalities worsened (i.e. progressed from Grades ≤ 2 to Grade 3 or higher) after the first 90 days of therapy in BRIGHT AML 1003:\n【76】 hypophosphatemia (8 in 38 patients), creatinine increased (2 in 39 patients), and ALT increased (2 in 40 patients).\n【77】 - hypophosphatemia (8 in 38 patients), creatinine increased (2 in 39 patients), and ALT increased (2 in 40 patients).\n【78】 ## Postmarketing Experience\n【79】 There is limited information regarding Daurismo Postmarketing Experience in the drug label.\n【80】 # Drug Interactions\n【81】 # Use in Specific Populations\n【82】 ### Pregnancy\n【83】 Pregnancy Category (FDA):\n【84】 - Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animal embryo-fetal developmental toxicity studies, DAURISMO can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no clinical data on the use of DAURISMO in pregnant women to inform of a drug-associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage. DAURISMO is not recommended for use during pregnancy. Conduct pregnancy testing in female patients of reproductive potential prior to initiating treatment with DAURISMO. Report pregnancy exposures to Pfizer at 1-800-438-1985.\n【85】 - The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown. Adverse outcomes in pregnancy occur regardless of the health of the mother or the use of medications. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.\n【86】 Pregnancy Category (AUS): \n【87】 There is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Glasdegib in women who are pregnant.\n【88】 ### Labor and Delivery\n【89】 The safety and effectiveness of DAURISMO during labor and delivery have not been evaluated.\n【90】 ### Nursing Mothers\n【91】 There are no data on the presence of glasdegib or its active metabolites in human milk, the effects of the drug on the breastfed child, or its effect on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child from DAURISMO, advise women who are taking DAURISMO not to breastfeed or provide breast milk to infants or children during treatment with DAURISMO and for at least 30 days after the last dose.\n【92】 ### Pediatric Use\n【93】 The safety and effectiveness of DAURISMO have not been established in pediatric patients. In repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats, oral administration of DAURISMO resulted in adverse changes in growing bone, teeth, and testis. Effects on bone consisted of partial to complete closure of the epiphyseal plate. Effects in growing incisor teeth included degeneration/necrosis of ameloblasts, and complete tooth loss with oral ulceration. Reproductive tissue toxicity was evidenced by testicular degeneration and hypospermatogenesis. These effects in bone, teeth and testis were observed after administration of DAURISMO for 26 weeks at greater than or equal to 50 mg/kg/day corresponding to approximately 6.6-times the steady state AUC in patients at the recommended human dose.\n【94】 ### Geriatic Use\n【95】 Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of DAURISMO with low-dose cytarabine (N=88), 98% of the patients were age 65 years or older and 60% of the patients were age 75 years or older. There were insufficient patients younger than age 65 years to determine differences in adverse reactions reported from patients older than 65.\n【96】 ### Gender\n【97】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of DAURISMO with respect to specific gender populations.\n【98】 ### Race\n【99】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of DAURISMO with respect to specific racial populations.\n【100】 ### Renal Impairment\n【101】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of DAURISMO in patients with renal impairment.\n【102】 ### Hepatic Impairment\n【103】 No dosage modification is recommended for patients with mild to severe renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate  15 to 89 mL/min). Monitor patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min) for increased risk of adverse reactions, including QTc interval prolongation, due to increased glasdegib concentrations.\n【104】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\n【105】 Conduct pregnancy testing in females of reproductive potential within 7 days prior to initiating therapy with DAURISMO.\n【106】 ### Contraception\n【107】 - Females: Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with DAURISMO and at least 30 days after the last dose.\n【108】 - Males: It is not known if glasdegib is present in semen. Advise males of the potential risk of exposure through semen and to use effective contraception, including a condom, even after a vasectomy, to avoid drug exposure to a pregnant partner or a female partner of reproductive potential during treatment with DAURISMO and for at least 30 days after the last dose. Advise males to not donate semen during treatment with DAURISMO for at least 30 days after the last dose.\n【109】 ### Infertility\n【110】 Males: Based on findings in repeat-dose animal toxicity studies in rats, DAURISMO may impair fertility in males of reproductive potential. Some effects on male reproductive organs did not recover. Men should seek advice on effective fertility preservation before treatment.\n【111】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\n【112】 There is no FDA guidance one the use of DAURISMO in patients who are immunocompromised.\n【113】 # Administration and Monitoring\n【114】 ### Administration\n【115】 ### Recommended Dosage and Schedule\n【116】 Recommended dosage: 100 mg orally once daily on days 1 to 28 in combination with cytarabine 20 mg subcutaneously twice daily on days 1 to 10 of each 28-day cycle in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or loss of disease control. For patients without unacceptable toxicity, treat for a minimum of 6 cycles to allow time for clinical response.\n【117】 - Administer DAURISMO with or without food.\n【118】 - Do not split or crush DAURISMO tablets.\n【119】 - Administer DAURISMO about the same time each day.\n【120】 - If a dose of DAURISMO is vomited, do not administer a replacement dose; wait until the next scheduled dose is due.\n【121】 - If a dose of DAURISMO is missed or not taken at the usual time, administer the dose as soon as possible and at least 12 hours prior to the next scheduled dose. Return to the normal schedule the following day.\n【122】 - Do not administer 2 doses of DAURISMO within 12 hours.\n【123】 ### Monitoring and Dosage Modifications\n【124】 - Assess complete blood counts, electrolytes, renal, and hepatic function prior to the initiation of DAURISMO and at least once weekly for the first month.\n【125】 - Monitor electrolytes and renal function once monthly for the duration of therapy.\n【126】 - Obtain serum creatine kinase levels prior to initiating DAURISMO and as indicated clinically thereafter (e.g., if muscle symptoms are reported).\n【127】 - Monitor electrocardiograms (ECGs) prior to the initiation of DAURISMO, approximately one week after initiation, and then once monthly for the next two months to assess for QTc prolongation.\n【128】 - Repeat ECG if abnormal.\n【129】 ### Dosage Modification for Concomitant Use with Moderate CYP3A4 Inducers\n【130】 - Avoid concomitant use of DAURISMO with moderate CYP3A4 inducers.\n【131】 - If concomitant use of moderate CYP3A4 inducers cannot be avoided, increase the DAURISMO dosage as tolerated.\n【132】 - After the moderate CYP3A4 inducer has been discontinued for 7 days, resume the DAURISMO dose taken prior to initiating the moderate CYP3A4 inducer.\n【133】 ### Monitoring\n【134】 There is limited information regarding Glasdegib Monitoring in the drug label.\n【135】 # IV Compatibility\n【136】 There is limited information regarding the compatibility of Glasdegib and IV administrations.\n【137】 # Overdosage\n【138】 There is no specific antidote for DAURISMO. Management of DAURISMO overdose should include symptomatic treatment and ECG monitoring.\n【139】 Glasdegib has been administered in clinical studies up to a dose of 640 mg/day. At the highest dosage, the adverse reactions that were dose limiting were nausea, vomiting, dehydration, hypotension, fatigue, and dizziness.\n【140】 # Pharmacology\n【141】 ## Mechanism of Action\n【142】 - Glasdegib is an inhibitor of the Hedgehog pathway.\n【143】 - Glasdegib binds to and inhibits Smoothened, a transmembrane protein involved in hedgehog signal transduction.\n【144】 - In a murine xenotransplant model of human AML, glasdegib in combination with low-dose cytarabine, inhibited increases in tumor size and reduced the percentage of CD45+/CD33+ blasts in the marrow to a greater extent than glasdegib or low-dose cytarabine alone.\n【145】 ## Structure\n【146】 There is limited information regarding DAURISMO Structure in the drug label.\n【147】 ## Pharmacodynamics\n【148】 ### Cardiac Electrophysiology\n【149】 - The effect of glasdegib administration on corrected QT interval (QTc) was evaluated in a randomized, single-dose, double-blind, 4-way crossover, placebo- and open-label moxifloxacin-controlled study in 36 healthy subjects.\n【150】 - At therapeutic plasma concentrations for the recommended dose, achieved with a single dose of 150 mg DAURISMO, the largest placebo and baseline-adjusted QTc interval change was 8 ms (90% CI: 6, 10 ms).\n【151】 - At a two-fold therapeutic plasma concentration, achieved with a single dose of 300 mg DAURISMO, the QTc change was 13 ms (90% CI: 11, 16 ms). Glasdegib is associated with concentration-dependent QTc prolongation.\n【152】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n【153】 - DAURISMO at 5 mg to 600 mg once daily (0.05 to 6 times the recommended dose) result in a dose proportional increase in glasdegib peak concentrations (Cmax) and area under the curve over the dosing interval (AUC0-Tau).\n【154】 - Steady-state plasma levels are reached by 8 days of daily dosing.\n【155】 - The median accumulation ratio of glasdegib ranged from 1.2 to 2.5 following once-daily dosing.\n【156】 - At DAURISMO 100 mg once daily, the geometric mean (geometric coefficient of variation, % CV) of glasdegib Cmax was 1252 ng/mL (44%) and AUC0-Tau was 17210 ng*hr/mL (54%) in patients with cancer.\n【157】 ### Absorption\n【158】 - The mean absolute bioavailability of DAURISMO is 77%. Following 100 mg once daily dosing, glasdegib median time to peak concentrations (Tmax) at steady-state ranged from 1.3 hours to 1.8 hours.\n【159】 - Effect of Food: A high-fat, high-calorie meal (total 800–1000 calories: 500–600 fat calories, 250 carbohydrate calories and 150 protein calories) reduced area under the curve over time to infinity (AUC0-INF) by 16% and Cmax by 31%.\n【160】 ### Distribution\n【161】 Glasdegib is 91% bound to human plasma proteins in vitro. The geometric mean (%CV) apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) was 188 L (20%) in patients with hematologic malignancies.\n【162】 ### Elimination\n【163】 Glasdegib has a mean (± SD) half-life of 17.4 h (3.7) and geometric mean (%CV) apparent clearance of 6.45 L/h (25%) following 100 mg once daily dosing in patients with hematologic malignancies.\n【164】 - Metabolism\n【165】 Glasdegib is primarily metabolized by the CYP3A4 pathway, with minor contributions by CYP2C8 and UGT1A9. Glasdegib accounts for 69% of the total circulating drug related material in plasma.\n【166】 - Glasdegib is primarily metabolized by the CYP3A4 pathway, with minor contributions by CYP2C8 and UGT1A9.

Hypospermatogenesis did not recover whereas testicular degeneration did recover. The dose at which testicular effects were observed in male rats was identified as 50 mg/kg/day with corresponding systemic exposures that were approximately 6.6-times (based on AUC) those associated with the observed human exposure at the 100 mg once daily dose.\n【202】 - Men should seek advice on effective fertility preservation before treatment.\n【203】 - In repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats, findings observed in the male reproductive tract included adverse testicular changes with glasdegib at doses ≥50 mg/kg/day, and consisted of minimal to severe hypospermatogenesis characterized by partial to complete loss of spermatogonia, spermatocytes and spermatids and testicular degeneration.

The gene contains 9 exons, two of which are protein-coding. There is a CAG repeat in the coding sequence which is longer in humans than other species (6-38 uninterrupted CAG repeats in healthy humans versus 2 in the mouse gene). This repeat is prone to errors in DNA replication and can vary widely in length between individuals.\n【6】 # Structure\n【7】 Notable features of the Ataxin-1 protein structure include:\n【8】 - A polyglutamine tract of variable length, encoded by the CAG repeat in ATXN1.\n【9】 - A region which mediates protein-protein interactions, known as the AXH domain\n【10】 - A nuclear localization sequence\n【11】 - A phosphorylation site which regulates the protein's stability and interactions with its binding partners\n【12】 # Function\n【13】 The function of Ataxin-1 is not completely understood. It appears to be involved in regulating gene expression based on its location in the nucleus of the cell, its association with promoter regions of several genes, and its interactions with transcriptional regulators and parts of the RNA splicing machinery.\n【14】 # Interactions\n【15】 Ataxin 1 has been shown to interact with:\n【16】 - C2orf27,\n【17】 - Coilin,\n【18】 - Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase,\n【19】 - UBE2E1, and\n【20】 - USP7.\n【21】 # Role in disease\n【22】 ATXN1 is the gene mutated in spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1), a dominantly-inherited, fatal genetic disease in which neurons in the cerebellum and brain stem degenerate over the course of years or decades. SCA1 is a trinucleotide repeat disorder caused by expansion of the CAG repeat in ATXN1; this leads to an expanded polyglutamine tract in the protein. This elongation is variable in length, with as few as 6 and as many as 81 repeats reported in humans. Repeats of 39 or more uninterrupted CAG triplets cause disease, and longer repeat tracts are correlated with earlier age of onset and faster progression.\n【23】 How polyglutamine expansion in Ataxin-1 causes neuronal dysfunction and degeneration is still unclear. Disease likely occurs through the combination of several processes.\n【24】 ## Aggregation\n【25】 Mutant Ataxin-1 protein spontaneously misfolds and forms aggregates in cells, much like other disease-associated proteins such as tau, Aβ, and huntingtin. This led to the hypothesis that the aggregates are toxic to neurons, but it has been shown in mice that aggregation is not required for pathogenesis. Other neuronal proteins can modulate the formation of Ataxin-1 aggregates and this in turn may affect aggregate-induced toxicity.\n【26】 ## Altered protein-protein interactions\n【27】 Soluble Ataxin-1 interacts with many other proteins. Polyglutamine expansion in Ataxin-1 can affect these interactions, sometimes causing loss of function (where the protein fails to perform one of its normal functions) and sometimes causing toxic gain of function (where the protein binds too strongly or to an inappropriate target). This, in turn, could alter the expression of the genes ataxin-1 regulates, leading to disease.\n【28】 ## HMGB1 interaction\n【29】 Mutant ataxin1 causes the neurodegenerative disease spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1).  In a mouse model of SCA1, mutant ataxin1 mediates the reduction or inhibition of the high mobility group box1 protein (HMGB1) in neuron mitochondria.  HMGB1 is a crucial nuclear protein that regulates DNA architectural changes essential for DNA damage repair and transcription.  The impairment of HMGB1 function leads to increased mitochondrial DNA damage.  In the SCA1 mouse model, over-expression of the HMGB1 protein by means of an introduced virus vector bearing the HMGB1 gene facilitates repair of the mitochondrial DNA damage, ameliorates the neuropathology and the motor deficits, and extends the lifespan of these mutant ataxin1 mice.", "title": "Ataxin 1", "tags": "", "lang": "", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"id\": \"c5d19dd66d404e22da9f1fa4c1e6c9a5b893f760\", \"source\": \"wikidoc\", \"url\": \"https://www.wikidoc.org/index.php/ATXN1\", \"overview\": \"None\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"type2": "换⾏错误#15#20#不需要换行"}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-01-28 23:07:59", "update_time": "2024-01-28 23:13:35"}

Agalmatophilia may also encompass Pygmalionism (from the myth of Pygmalion) which describes a state of love for an object of one's own creation.\n【2】 # Clinical study\n【3】 Agalmatophilia became a subject of clinical study with the publication of Richard von Krafft-Ebbing's Psychopathia Sexualis. Ebbing recorded the case in 1877 of a gardener falling in love with a statue of the Venus de Milo and being discovered while attempting coitus with it.\n【4】 # Fantasy, transformation and role-play\n【5】 An important fantasy for some individuals is being transformed into the preferred object (such as a statue) and experiencing an associated state of immobility or paralysis.

He then masturbates while hanging himself above them.

They must be strong so that they do not break, non-toxic, hypoallergenic (to avoid adverse reactions in the body), and flexible (so they can be tied and knotted easily). In addition, they must lack the so called \"wick effect\", which means that sutures must not allow fluids to penetrate the body through them from outside, which could easily cause infections.\n【3】 # Absorbable and nonabsorbable sutures\n【4】 Sutures (also known as stitches) are divided into two kinds – those which are absorbable and will break down harmlessly in the body over time without intervention, and those which are non-absorbable and must be manually removed if they are not left indefinitely. The type of suture used varies on the operation, with the major criteria being the demands of the location and environment.\n【5】 - Sutures to be placed internally would require re-opening if they were to be removed. Sutures which lie on the exterior of the body can be removed within minutes, and without re-opening the wound. As a result, absorbable sutures are often used internally; non-absorbable externally.\n【6】 - Sutures to be placed in a stressful environment, for example the heart (constant pressure and movement) or the bladder (adverse chemical presence) may require specialized or stronger materials to perform their role; usually such sutures are either specially treated, or made of special materials, and are often non-absorbable to reduce the risk of premature degradation.\n【7】 ## Absorbable sutures\n【8】 Absorbable sutures are made of materials which are broken down in tissue after a given period of time, which depending on the material can be from ten days to eight weeks. They are used therefore in many of the internal tissues of the body. In most cases, three weeks is sufficient for the wound to close firmly. The suture is not needed any more, and the fact that it disappears is an advantage, as there is no foreign material left inside the body and no need for the patient to have the sutures removed.\n【9】 Absorbable sutures were originally made of the intestines of sheep, the so called catgut. The manufacturing process was similar to that of natural musical strings for violins and guitar, and also of natural strings for tennis racquets.  The inventor, a 10th century surgeon named al-Zahrawi reportedly discovered the dissolving nature of catgut when his lute's strings were eaten by a monkey.  Today, gut sutures are made of specially prepared beef and sheep intestine, and may be untreated (plain gut), tanned with chromium salts to increase their persistence in the body (chromic gut), or heat-treated to give more rapid absorption (fast gut). However, the majority of absorbable sutures are now made of synthetic polymer fibers, which may be braided or monofilament; these offer numerous advantages over gut sutures, notably ease of handling, low cost, low tissue reaction, consistent performance and guaranteed non-toxicity.  In Europe and Japan, gut sutures have been banned due to concerns over bovine spongiform encephalopathy (mad-cow disease), although the herds from which gut is harvested are certified BSE-free.  Each major suture manufacturer has its own proprietary formulations for its brands of synthetic absorbable sutures; various blends of polyglycolic acid (Biovek for example), polylactic acid or caprolactone are common.\n【10】 Occasionally, absorbable sutures can cause inflammation and be rejected by the body rather than absorbed.\n【11】 ## Non-absorbable sutures\n【12】 Nonabsorbable sutures are made of materials which are not metabolized by the body, and are used therefore either on skin wound closure, where the sutures can be removed after a few weeks, or in some inner tissues in which absorbable sutures are not adequate. This is the case, for example, in the heart and in blood vessels, whose rhythmic movement requires a suture which stays longer than three weeks, to give the wound enough time to close. Other organs, like the bladder, contain fluids which make absorbable sutures disappear in only a few days, too early for the wound to heal. Inflammation caused by the foreign protein in some absorbable sutures can amplify scarring, so if other types of suture are less antigenic (ie, do not provoke as much of an immune response) it would represent a way to reduce scarring.\n【13】 There are several materials used for nonabsorbable sutures. The most common is a natural fiber, silk, which undergoes a special manufacturing process to make it adequate for its use in surgery. Other nonabsorbable sutures are made of artificial fibers, like polypropylene, polyester or nylon; these may or may not have coatings to enhance their performance characteristics. Finally, stainless steel wires are commonly used in orthopedic surgery and for sternal closure in cardiac surgery.\n【14】 # Surgical needles for use with sutures\n【15】 Traumatic needles are needles with holes or eyes which are supplied to the hospital separate from their suture thread. The suture must be threaded on site, as is done when sewing at home. Atraumatic needles with sutures comprise an eyeless needle attached to a specific length of suture thread.  The suture manufacturer swages the suture thread to the eyeless atraumatic needle at the factory.  There are several advantages to having the needle pre-mounted on the suture.  The doctor or the nurse or odp does not have to spend time threading the suture on the needle.  More importantly, the suture end of a swaged needle is smaller than the needle body.  In traumatic needles with eyes, the thread comes out of the needle's hole on both sides.  When passing through the tissues, this type of suture rips the tissue to a certain extent, thus the name traumatic.  Nearly all modern sutures feature swaged atraumatic needles.\n【16】 There are several shapes of surgical needles, including:\n【17】 - straight\n【18】 - half curved or ski\n【19】 - 1/4 circle\n【20】 - 3/8 circle\n【21】 - 1/2 circle\n【22】 - 5/8 circle\n【23】 - compound curve\n【24】 Needles may also be classified by their point geometry; examples include:\n【25】 - taper (needle body is round and tapers smoothly to a point)\n【26】 - cutting (needle body is triangular and has a sharpened cutting edge on the inside)\n【27】 - reverse cutting (cutting edge on the outside)\n【28】 - trocar point or tapercut (needle body is round and tapered, but ends in a small triangular cutting point)\n【29】 - blunt points for sewing friable tissues\n【30】 - side cutting or spatula points (flat on top and bottom with a cutting edge along the front to one side) for eye surgery\n【31】 Finally, atraumatic needles may be permanently swaged to the suture or may be designed to come off the suture with a sharp straight tug.  These \"pop-offs\" are commonly used for interrupted sutures, where each suture is only passed once and then tied.\n【32】 # Sizes of sutures\n【33】 Suture sizes are defined by the United States Pharmacopeia (U.S.P.).  Sutures were originally manufactured ranging in size from #1 to #6, with #1 being the smallest.  A #4 suture would be roughly the diameter of a tennis racquet string.  The manufacturing techniques, derived at the beginning from the production of musical strings, did not allow thinner diameters.  As the procedures improved, #0 was added to the suture diameters, and later, thinner and thinner threads were manufactured, which were identified as #00 (#2-0 or #2/0) to #000000 (#6-0 or #6/0).\n【34】 Modern sutures range from #5 (heavy braided suture for orthopedics) to #11-0 (fine monofilament suture for ophthalmics).  Atraumatic needles are manufactured in all shapes for most sizes.  The actual diameter of thread for a given U.S.P. size differs depending on the suture material class.\n【35】 # Suture techniques\n【36】 Common suture stitching techniques include:\n【37】 - Simple Interrupted Stitch\n【38】 - Running Stitch\n【39】 - Mattress\n【40】 - Horizontal mattress\n【41】 - Vertical mattress\n【42】 - Figure 8\n【43】 - Continuous locking\n【44】 - Subcuticular\n【45】 # Removal of sutures\n【46】 While some sutures are intended to be permanent, and others in specialized cases may be kept in place for an extended period of many weeks, as a rule sutures are a short term device to allow healing of a trauma or wound. According to about.com's article on nursing:\n【47】 # Suture materials\n【48】 # U.S.P. Needle Pull Specifications\n【49】 # Other facts\n【50】 ## Tissue adhesives\n【51】 In recent years, topical cyanoacrylate adhesives (\"liquid stitches\") have been used in combination with, or as an alternative to, sutures in wound closure.  The adhesive remains liquid until exposed to water or water-containing substances/tissue, after which it cures (polymerizes) and forms a flexible film that bonds to the underlying surface.  The tissue adhesive has been shown to act as a barrier to microbial penetration as long as the adhesive film remains intact. Limitations of tissue adhesives include contraindications to use near the eyes and a mild learning curve on correct usage.\n【52】 Cyanoacrylate is the generic name for cyanoacrylate based fast-acting glues such as methyl-2-cyanoacrylate, ethyl-2-cyanoacrylate (commonly sold under trade names like Superglue and Krazy Glue), n-butyl-cyanoacrylate.  Skin glues like Indermil and Histoacryl were the first medical grade tissue adhesives to be used, and these are composed of n-butyl cyanoacrylate.  These worked well but had the disadvantage of having to be stored in the refrigerator, were exothermic so they stung the patient, and the bond was brittle.  Nowadays, the longer chain polymer, 2-octyl cyanoacrylate is the preferred medical grade glue encountered under various trade names, e.g. SurgiSeal, FloraSeal, and Dermabond.  These have the advantage of being more flexible, stronger bond, and easier to use.\n【53】 ## Antimicrobial sutures\n【54】 Another recent development in wound closure involves the use of sutures coated with antimicrobial substances to reduce the chances of wound infection.  While long-term studies are not yet available, preliminary results indicate that these sutures are effective at inhibiting bacterial growth in wounds.", "title": "Surgical suture", "tags": "", "lang": "", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"id\": \"29c099f2559d1aab7af56298a9b7395c4197c063\", \"overview\": \"None\", \"url\": \"https://www.wikidoc.org/index.php/Surgical_suture\", \"source\": \"wikidoc\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-01-28 23:07:59", "update_time": "2024-02-18 19:44:40"}

Symptoms may include loss of visual acuity, pain, sensitivity to light and foreign body sensation.\n【6】 Treatment aims to restore a normal regular corneal surface and adherence between the epithelium and Bowman's membrane (a basement membrane that lies between the outer layer of stratified epithelium and the substance of the cornea) with associated improvement in visual acuity and comfort.\n【7】 Standard treatment includes lubrication of the ocular surface, bandage contact lens placement or topical medication. Surgical procedures may include anterior stromal puncture, mechanical debridement, lamellar keratoplasty or resurfacing keratectomy using a diamond burr. Corneal transplantation may be considered in eyes refractory to treatment.\n【8】 # Outline of the procedure\n【9】 The aim of phototherapeutic laser keratectomy for corneal surface irregularities is to create a smooth stromal surface to improve postoperative corneal clarity, decrease existing scarring and facilitate subsequent epithelial adhesion.\n【10】 Local anaesthetic eye drops are applied and the corneal epithelium is mechanically removed. A laser is used to sequentially ablate uniformly thin layers of corneal tissue, creating a smooth surface which then becomes re-epithelialised. Postoperative management consists of an eye pad, topical antibiotics, sedatives and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.\n【11】 Sections 2.3 and 2.4 describe efficacy and safety outcomes from the published literature that the Committee considered as part of the evidence about this procedure. For more detailed information on the evidence, see the overview.\n【12】 # Efficacy\n【13】 A non-randomised controlled study of 39 patients (42 eyes) reported no significant difference in overall change in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) between patients treated by phototherapeutic laser keratectomy and those treated by diamond burr polishing at 7-month follow-up (p = 0.6): BCVA improved in 36% (5/14) and 14% (3/21) of eyes, remained unchanged in 64% (9/14) and 81% (17/21) of eyes and worsened in 0% (0/14) and 5% (1/21) of eyes respectively.\n【14】 In a case series of 211 patients (232 eyes) mean BCVA improved by 1.4 lines from baseline at 2-year follow-up (p < 0.002). No significant difference was reported in BCVA improvement between subgroups of patients with corneal dystrophy, nodular degeneration, corneal scar, or band keratopathy (absolute figures not stated) (p = 0.15).\n【15】 In a case series of 216 patients (252 eyes), among eyes with recurrent erosion at baseline, further recurrent erosion was reported in 9% (9/103) of eyes at 12-month follow-up.\n【16】 The case series of 216 patients reported that 100% (29/29) of eyes with band-like keratopathy were pain free by 6-day follow-up.\n【17】 A case series of 191 patients (203 eyes) reported that significantly fewer patients with bullous keratopathy had severe symptoms of pain, photosensitivity and/or watering at 6-month follow-up (n = 15) compared with baseline (n = 56) (p < 0.017). Similarly, significantly fewer patients with corneal scarring had severe symptoms at 6-month follow-up (n = 4) compared with baseline (n = 13) (p < 0.0001).\n【18】 The Specialist Advisers listed key efficacy outcomes as visual acuity, ocular surface health, ocular comfort and pain relief.\n【19】 # Safety\n【20】 Recurrent keratitis requiring penetrating keratoplasty was reported in 1% (3/232) of eyes at up to 2-year follow-up in the case series of 211 patients.\n【21】 One occurrence each of progressing keratolysis at 8-day follow-up, circular subepithelial corneal scarring at 5-month follow-up (both requiring penetrating keratoplasty), progressive kerectasia at 6 months (sequelae not reported), and a sterile corneal immune ring at 4-day follow-up, were described in 4 separate case reports.\n【22】 A loss of BCVA of 2 lines or more was reported in 13% (3/24) of patients at 2-year follow-up in the case series of 211 patients.\n【23】 Idiopathic iritis and a marginal corneal ulcer developed in 1 eye each at up to 2-year follow-up in the case series of 211 patients.\n【24】 Mild postoperative haze was reported in 11% (22/203) of eyes in the case series of 191 patients; this resolved in 12 eyes by 6-month follow-up. There was no significant difference in the occurrence of mild haze between patients treated by laser phototherapeutic keratectomy (33%  of eyes) or by diamond burr polishing (26%  of eyes) in the non-randomised controlled study of 39 patients at 7-month follow-up (p = 0.38).\n【25】 The Specialist Advisers identified corneal infection as an adverse event reported in the literature. They considered theoretical adverse events to include epithelial defect, corneal ectasia, scarring and induction of astigmatism or refractive error.\n【26】 # Other comments\n【27】 The Committee noted that the published evidence comprised a mixture of different indications and outcomes, but nevertheless they considered that the case for safety and efficacy was adequately supported by this evidence and by specialist advice.\n【28】 NICE received 3 completed questionnaires from patients treated by the procedure. They reported improvements in quality of life including reduced photosensitivity (which had required sunglasses) and the ability to walk with more confidence.# Further information\n【29】 # Information for patients\n【30】 NICE has produced information on this procedure for patients and carers ('Understanding NICE guidance'). It explains the nature of the procedure and the guidance issued by NICE, and has been written with patient consent in mind. A large print version is also available.# About this guidance\n【31】 NICE interventional procedure guidance makes recommendations on the safety and efficacy of the procedure. It does not cover whether or not the NHS should fund a procedure. Funding decisions are taken by local NHS bodies after considering the clinical effectiveness of the procedure and whether it represents value for money for the NHS. It is for healthcare professionals and people using the NHS in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, and is endorsed by Healthcare Improvement Scotland for implementation by NHSScotland.\n【32】 This guidance was developed using the NICE interventional procedure guidance process.\n【33】 We have produced a summary of this guidance for patients and carers. Information about the evidence it is based on is also available.\n【34】 Changes since publication\n【35】 January 2012: minor maintenance.\n【36】 Your responsibility\n【37】 This guidance represents the views of NICE and was arrived at after careful consideration of the available evidence. Healthcare professionals are expected to take it fully into account when exercising their clinical judgement. This guidance does not, however, override the individual responsibility of healthcare professionals to make appropriate decisions in the circumstances of the individual patient, in consultation with the patient and/or guardian or carer.\n【38】 Implementation of this guidance is the responsibility of local commissioners and/or providers. Commissioners and providers are reminded that it is their responsibility to implement the guidance, in their local context, in light of their duties to avoid unlawful discrimination and to have regard to promoting equality of opportunity. Nothing in this guidance should be interpreted in a way which would be inconsistent with compliance with those duties.\n【39】 Copyright\n【40】 © National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence 2010.

The Interventional Procedures Advisory Committee reconsidered the procedure based on the results of a systematic review commissioned by NICE, following publication of the results of the EndoVascular Aneurysm Repair (EVAR) trials.\n【3】 Current evidence on the efficacy and short-term safety of stent–graft placement in abdominal aortic aneurysm appears adequate to support the use of this procedure provided that the normal arrangements are in place for consent, audit and clinical governance.\n【4】 Clinicians should ensure that patients fully understand the long-term uncertainties and the potential complications associated with this procedure. In particular, patients should understand: the risks of endovascular leaks; the possibility of secondary intervention; and the need for lifelong follow-up. Patients should be provided with clear written information. In addition, use of the Institute's information for the public is recommended.\n【5】 Patient selection is important, particularly for patients who would normally be considered unfit for surgery.\n【6】 Publication of long-term data would be useful. It is recommended that all patients who have the procedure are entered onto one of the existing registries.# The procedure\n【7】 # Indications\n【8】 Stent–graft placement is used to treat aneurysms of the abdominal aorta. Weakening of the wall of the aorta can lead to widening of the vessel, or aneurysm. Aneurysms may rupture causing internal bleeding which, if untreated, is usually fatal.\n【9】 The standard treatment for abdominal aortic aneurysm is open surgical repair. The aneurysm is opened and a graft is then sewn in above and below the weakened area to allow normal blood flow.\n【10】 # Outline of the procedure\n【11】 Stent–graft placement is a minimally invasive alternative to open repair. The graft is mounted on a stent, which is inserted into the aorta via catheters in the femoral arteries. The stent–graft is deployed under X-ray guidance and positioned across the aneurysm. Additional endovascular or surgical interventions may be necessary to complete the procedure, such as insertion of stents into the iliac arteries, occlusion of selected arteries and femoro-femoral bypass grafts.\n【12】 # Efficacy\n【13】 A systematic review of the published evidence on this procedure was commissioned by the Institute and completed in June 2005. A total of 77 studies were identified for inclusion. This comprised: four randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including the EndoVascular Aneurysm Repair (EVAR) 1 trial comparing stent–graft placement and open surgical repair, and the EVAR 2 trial comparing stent–graft placement in patients considered unfit for surgical repair with standard medical care; 17 non-randomised controlled trials; 22 comparative observational studies; 28 case series and six registry publications.\n【14】 Data from the EVAR 1 trial at a median follow-up of 35 months reported an aneurysm rupture rate of 0.9% (5/543) following endovascular repair, compared with 0.2% (1/539) following open repair. Early aneurysm rupture rates of 0.2% (1/534) and 0.3% (13/3859) were reported in one non-randomised controlled trial and seven case series, respectively.\n【15】 In the EVAR 1 trial, 16% (85/529) of patients required secondary intervention following stent–graft placement, compared with 7% (36/519) of patients following open repair. From the non-randomised controlled studies, secondary intervention rates were 20% following stent–graft placement and 6% following open repair.\n【16】 The EVAR 2 trial reported that at 4 years, 26% of the group who had had stent–graft placement had required at least one additional intervention compared with 4% of the group who had received standard medical care. However, if crossovers are considered a secondary intervention, then the secondary intervention rate in the group that received standard medical care became comparable (approximately 30%). For more details, refer to the Sources of evidence.\n【17】 # Safety\n【18】 From a meta-analysis of data from three RCTs, stent–graft placement was associated with a 30-day mortality rate of 2% (12/759 patients) compared with 5% (33/709 patients) for open repair. In patients considered unfit for surgery, the 30-day mortality following stent–graft placement was 9% (13/150 patients).\n【19】 During more prolonged follow-up to 4 years, the EVAR 1 trial reported no significant difference between the all-cause mortality rate in the group that had had stent–graft placement and the group that had had open repair.\n【20】 The most common adverse event following stent–graft placement was endoleak originating from retrograde collateral flow into the aneurysm sac via aortic branches (type II). This occurred in 19% of patients at 1 year. Recent developments have led to a lower incidence of procedural and post-procedural complications. The incidence of pulmonary complications and haemorrhagic events was significantly lower in the stent–graft placement group than in the open repair group.\n【21】 Technical complications included stent migration, which happened in 1% of patients within the first year, and stent wire fracture, which happened in 3% of patients within the first year.

It does not cover whether or not the NHS should fund a procedure. Funding decisions are taken by local NHS bodies after considering the clinical effectiveness of the procedure and whether it represents value for money for the NHS. It is for healthcare professionals and people using the NHS in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, and is endorsed by Healthcare Improvement Scotland for implementation by NHSScotland.\n【33】 This guidance was developed using the NICE interventional procedure guidance process.\n【34】 It updates and replaces NICE interventional procedure guidance 10.\n【35】 We have produced a summary of this guidance for patients and carers. Information about the evidence it is based on is also available.\n【36】 Changes since publication\n【37】 January 2012: minor maintenance.\n【38】 Your responsibility\n【39】 This guidance represents the views of NICE and was arrived at after careful consideration of the available evidence. Healthcare professionals are expected to take it fully into account when exercising their clinical judgement. This guidance does not, however, override the individual responsibility of healthcare professionals to make appropriate decisions in the circumstances of the individual patient, in consultation with the patient and/or guardian or carer.\n【40】 Implementation of this guidance is the responsibility of local commissioners and/or providers. Commissioners and providers are reminded that it is their responsibility to implement the guidance, in their local context, in light of their duties to avoid unlawful discrimination and to have regard to promoting equality of opportunity. Nothing in this guidance should be interpreted in a way which would be inconsistent with compliance with those duties.\n【41】 Copyright\n【42】 © National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence 2006.

It has a high degree of homology to plasma retinol-binding protein and other members of the alpha 2 microglobulin protein superfamily of carrier proteins, also known as lipocalins. It is a glycoprotein of estimated molecular weight 33 KDa. Apo-D is closely associated with the enzyme lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase - an enzyme involved in lipoprotein metabolism.

Its structure is similar to that of glucose. However, glucuronic acid's sixth carbon is oxidized to a carboxylic acid. Its formula is C6H10O7.\n【2】 The salts of glucuronic acid are known as glucuronates; the anion C6H9O7− is the glucuronate ion.\n【3】 Glucuronic acid should not be confused with gluconic acid, a linear carboxylic acid resulting from the oxidation of a different carbon of glucose.  Both Glucuronic Acid and Gluconic Acid are reported to be found in the fermented drink known as Kombucha. Glucuronic acid has been attributed with the mildly-alcoholic effect that drinking the tea has for some.\n【4】 # Functions\n【5】 ## Glucuronidation\n【6】 Glucuronic acid is highly soluble in water. In the animal body, glucuronic acid is often linked to substances such as drugs, pollutants, bilirubin, androgens, estrogens, mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids, fatty acid derivatives, retinoids, and bile acids. These linkages involve O-glycosidic bonds, and this linkage process is known as glucuronidation. \n【7】 Glucuronidation occurs mainly in the liver, although the enzyme responsible for its catalysis, UDP-glucuronyltransferase, has been found in all major body organs, e.g., heart, kidneys, adrenal gland, spleen, and thymus. UDP-glucuronic acid (glucuronic acid linked via a glycosidic bond to uridine diphosphate) is an intermediate in the process and is formed in the liver.\n【8】 The substances resulting from glucuronidation are known as glucuronides (or glucuronosides) and are typically much more water-soluble than the non-glucuronic acid-containing substance from which they were originally synthesised. The human body uses glucuronidation to make a large variety of substances more water-soluble, and, in this way, allow for their subsequent elimination from the body upon urination. Hormones may also be glucuronidated to allow for easier transport around the body. Pharmacists also commonly link drugs to glucuronic acid to allow for easier drug delivery.\n【9】 ### Acyl glucuronidation\n【10】 Acyl glucuronidation is an important metabolic pathway for fluoroquinolone\n【11】 antibiotics.\n【12】 ### N-glucuronidation\n【13】 # Conformation\n【14】 Unlike its C5 epimer iduronic acid, which may occur in a number of conformations, glucuronic acid occurs in predominantly the 4C1 conformation.\n【15】 # Glucuronidases\n【16】 Glucuronidases are those enzymes that hydrolyze the glycosidic bond between glucuronic acid and some other compound.", "title": "Glucuronic acid", "tags": "", "lang": "", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"id\": \"ab1806be0d0ed5b893406db7680332241b9bdb24\", \"overview\": \"None\", \"url\": \"https://www.wikidoc.org/index.php/D-glucuronic_acid\", \"source\": \"wikidoc\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-01-28 23:07:59", "update_time": "2024-02-18 19:22:10"}

There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of IMITREX Tablets. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. IMITREX Tablets may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal's angina), even in patients without a history of CAD.\n【4】 Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-naive patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving IMITREX Tablets. If there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm, IMITREX Tablets are contraindicated. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administering the first dose of IMITREX Tablets in a medically supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following administration of IMITREX Tablets. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of IMITREX Tablets.\n【5】 ### Arrhythmias\n【6】 Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death, have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT1 agonists. Discontinue IMITREX Tablets if these disturbances occur. IMITREX Tablets are contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders.\n【7】 ### Chest, Throat, Neck, and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure\n【8】 Sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the precordium, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with IMITREX Tablets and are usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. The use of IMITREX Tablets is contraindicated in patients with CAD and those with Prinzmetal’s variant angina.\n【9】 ### Cerebrovascular Events\n【10】 Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine when they were not. Also, patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., stroke, hemorrhage, TIA). Discontinue IMITREX Tablets if a cerebrovascular event occurs.\n【11】 Before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with atypical symptoms, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. IMITREX Tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or TIA.\n【12】 ### Other Vasospasm Reactions\n【13】 IMITREX Tablets may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud’s syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of non-coronary vasospasm reaction following the use of any 5-HT1 agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional IMITREX Tablets.\n【14】 Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5‑HT1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT1 agonists have not been clearly established.\n【15】 ### Medication Overuse Headache\n【16】 Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or combination of these drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary.\n【17】 ### Serotonin Syndrome\n【18】 Serotonin syndrome may occur with IMITREX Tablets, particularly during co-administration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors . Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue IMITREX Tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected.\n【19】 ### Increase in Blood Pressure\n【20】 Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis with acute impairment of organ systems, has been reported on rare occasions in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, including patients without a history of hypertension. Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with IMITREX. IMITREX Tablets are contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension.\n【21】 ### Anaphylactic/Anaphylactoid Reactions\n【22】 Anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions have occurred in patients receiving IMITREX. Such reactions can be life threatening or fatal. In general, anaphylactic reactions to drugs are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. IMITREX Tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to IMITREX.\n【23】 ### Seizures\n【24】 Seizures have been reported following administration of IMITREX. Some have occurred in patients with either a history of seizures or concurrent conditions predisposing to seizures. There are also reports in patients where no such predisposing factors are apparent. IMITREX Tablets should be used with caution in patients with a history of epilepsy or conditions associated with a lowered seizure threshold.", "title": "IMITREX tablet warnings and precautions", "tags": "", "lang": "", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"overview\": \"None\", \"source\": \"wikidoc\", \"url\": \"https://www.wikidoc.org/index.php/IMITREX_tablet_warnings_and_precautions\", \"id\": \"cac365739609162bad0c21497dc59f6cf9c531ed\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-01-28 23:07:59", "update_time": "2024-02-18 19:53:15"}

Similar interactions within a species are known as co-operation.\n【3】 Mutualism plays a key part in ecology and evolutionary biology.  For example, mutualistic interactions are vital for terrestrial ecosystem function as more than 90% of land plants rely on mycorrhizal relationships with fungi to provide them with inorganic compounds and trace elements.  In addition, mutualism has driven the evolution of much of the biological diversity we see, such as flower forms (important for pollination mutualisms) and co-evolution between groups of species  However mutualism has historically received less attention than other interactions such as predation and parasitism .\n【4】 Measuring the exact fitness benefit to the individuals is not always straightforward, particularly when the individuals can receive benefits from a range of species, for example most plant-pollinator mutualisms.  It is therefore common to categorise mutualisms according to the closeness of the association, using terms such as obligate, facultative and symbiotic.  Defining \"closeness\", however, is also problematical. It can refer to mutual dependency (the species cannot live without one another) or the biological intimacy of the relationship in relation to physical closeness (e.g. one species living within the tissues of the other species).  Mutualism and symbiosis are sometimes used to refer to the same thing but this is strictly incorrect: the term symbiosis was originally meant to include relationships which were mutualistic, parasitic or commensal.\n【5】 # Types of relationships\n【6】 Mutualistic interactions can be thought of as a form of \"biological barter\" in which species trade resources (for example carbohydrates or inorganic compounds) or services such as gamete or offspring dispersal, or protection from predators.\n【7】 ## Resource-resource relationships\n【8】 Resource-resource interactions, in which one type of resource is traded for a different resource, are probably the most common form of mutualism; for example mycorrhizal associations between plant roots and fungi, with the plant providing carbohydrates to the fungus in return for nitrogenous compounds and water.  Other examples include  rhizobia bacteria which fix nitrogen for leguminous plants (family Fabaceae) in return for energy-containing carbohydrates.\n【9】 ## Service-resource relationships\n【10】 Service-resource relationships are also common, for example pollination in which nectar or pollen (food resources) are traded for pollen dispersal (a service) or ant protection of aphids, where the aphids trade sugar-rich honeydew (a by-product of their mode of feeding on plant sap) in return for defence against predators such as ladybird beetles.\n【11】 ## Service-service relationships\n【12】 Strict service-service interactions are very rare, for reasons that are far from clear.  One example is the relationship between sea anemones and anemonefish in the family Pomacentridae: the anemones provide the fish with protection from predators (which cannot tolerate the stings of the anemone's tentacles) and the fish defend the anemones against butterfly fish (family Chaetodontidae) which eat anemones.  However, in common with many mutualisms, there is more than one aspect to the biological barter: in the anemonefish-anemone mutualism, waste ammonia from the fish feed the symbiotic algae that are found in the anemone's tentacles. Therefore what appears to be a service-service mutualism in fact has a service-resource component. A second example is that of the relationship between some ants and trees in the genus Acacia, such as the Whistling Thorn and Bullhorn Acacia. The ants nest inside the plant's thorns. In exchange for shelter, the ants protect acacias from attack by herbivores (which they frequently eat, introducing a resource component to this service-service relationship) and competition from other plants by trimming back vegetation that would shade the acacia.\n【13】 In addition, another service-resource component is present, as the ants regularly feed on lipid-rich food-bodies called Beltian bodies that are on the Acacia plant.\n【14】 # Humans and mutualism\n【15】 Humans also engage in mutualisms with other species, including our gut flora (without which we would not be able to digest food efficiently) and domesticated animals such as dogs, which provide protection in return for food and shelter. In traditional agriculture, many plants will function mutualistically as companion plants, providing each other with shelter, soil fertility and the repelling of pests. For example, beans may grow up cornstalks as a trellis, while fixing nitrogen in the soil for the corn, as exploited in the Three Sisters gardening technique. The question how and why species might cooperate has been addressed philosophically by a number of writers. Gilles Deleuze, for example, was interested in the way this questioned the conception of evolutionism and the notion of linear historical progress.", "title": "Mutualism", "tags": "", "lang": "", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"id\": \"b0410ef919d99515d8445886360ca5e89a531ed2\", \"source\": \"wikidoc\", \"url\": \"https://www.wikidoc.org/index.php/Mutualism\", \"overview\": \"None\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-01-28 23:07:59", "update_time": "2024-02-18 22:46:41"}

Treatment of the β-hydroxysilane with acid will yield one alkene, while treatment of the same β-hydroxysilane with base will yield the alkene of opposite stereochemistry.\n【5】 ## Basic elimination\n【6】 The action of base upon a β-hydroxysilane 1 results in a concerted syn elimination of 2 or 3 to form the desired alkene. The penta-coordinate silicon intermediate 3 is postulated, but no proof exists to date.\n【7】 Potassium alkoxides eliminate quickly, while sodium alkoxides generally require heating. Magnesium alkoxides only eliminate in extreme conditions. The order of reactivity of alkoxides, K > Na >> Mg, is consistent with higher electron density on oxygen, hence increasing the alkoxide nucleophilicity.\n【8】 ## Acidic elimination\n【9】 The treatment of the β-hydroxysilane 1 with acid results in protonation and an anti elimination to form the desired alkene.\n【10】 ## Alkyl substituents\n【11】 When the α-silyl carbanion contains only alkyl, hydrogen, or electron-donating substituents, the stereochemical outcome of the Peterson olefination can be controlled, because at low temperature the elimination is slow and the intermediate β-hydroxysilane can be isolated.\n【12】 Once isolated, the diastereomeric β-hydroxysilanes are separated. One diastereomer is treated with acid, while the other is treated with base, thus converted the material to an alkene with the required stereochemistry.\n【13】 ## Electron-withdrawing substituents\n【14】 When the α-silyl carbanion contains electron-withdrawing substituents, the Peterson olefination directly forms the alkene. The intermediate β-hydroxysilane cannot be isolated as it eliminates in-situ. The basic elimination pathway has been postulated in these cases.\n【15】 # Variations\n【16】 Acidic elimination conditions are sometimes not feasible as the acid also promotes double bond isomerization. Additionally, elimation using sodium or potassium hydride may not be feasible due to incompatible functional groups. Chan et al. have found that acylation of the intermediate silylcarbinol with either acetyl chloride or thionyl chloride gives a β-silyl ester that will eliminate spontaneously at 25°C giving the desired alkene. Corey and co-workers developed a method (sometimes dubbed the Corey-Peterson olefination) using a silylated imine to yield an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde from a carbonyl compound in one step. \n【17】 For an example for its use in total synthesis see: Kuwajima Taxol total synthesis", "title": "Peterson olefination", "tags": "", "lang": "", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"overview\": \"None\", \"id\": \"16dbba7e50983bb3ab3c56b9bdd9810f39a45ca2\", \"url\": \"https://www.wikidoc.org/index.php/Peterson_olefination\", \"source\": \"wikidoc\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-01-28 23:07:59", "update_time": "2024-01-28 23:30:38"}

Although CD56 is often considered a marker of neural lineage commitment due to its discovery site, CD56 expression is also found in, among others, the hematopoietic system. Here, the expression of CD56 is most stringently associated with, but certainly not limited to, natural killer cells. CD56 has been detected on other lymphoid cells, including gamma delta (γδ) Τ cells and activated CD8+ T cells, as well as on dendritic cells. NCAM has been implicated as having a role in cell–cell adhesion, neurite outgrowth, synaptic plasticity, and learning and memory.\n【2】 # Forms, domains and homophilic binding\n【3】 NCAM is a glycoprotein of Immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily.\n【4】 At least 27 alternatively spliced NCAM mRNAs are produced, giving a wide diversity of NCAM isoforms. The three main isoforms of NCAM vary only in their cytoplasmic domain:\n【5】 - NCAM-120kDa (GPI anchored)\n【6】 - NCAM-140kDa (short cytoplasmic domain)\n【7】 - NCAM-180kDa (long cytoplasmic domain)\n【8】 The extracellular domain of NCAM consists of five immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domains followed by two fibronectin type III (FNIII) domains. The different domains of NCAM have been shown to have different roles, with the Ig domains being involved in homophilic binding to NCAM, and the FNIII domains being involved signaling leading to neurite outgrowth.\n【9】 Homophilic binding occurs between NCAM molecules on opposing surfaces (trans-) and NCAM molecules on the same surface (cis-)1. There is much controversy as to how exactly NCAM homophilic binding is arranged both in trans- and cis-. Current models suggest trans- homophilic binding occurs between two NCAM molecules binding antiparallel between all five Ig domains or just IgI and IgII. cis- homophilic binding is thought to occur by interactions between both IgI and IgII, and IgI and IgIII, forming a higher order NCAM multimer. Both cis- and trans- NCAM homophilic binding have been shown to be important in NCAM “activation” leading to neurite outgrowth.\n【10】 # Minor exons\n【11】 Another layer of complexity is created by the insertion of other \"minor\" exons in the NCAM transcript. The two most notable are:\n【12】 - the VASE (VAriable domain Spliced Exon) exon which is thought to correlate with an inhibition of the neurite outgrowth promoting properties of NCAM.\n【13】 - the MSD (Muscle Specific Domain), which is thought to play a positive role in myoblast fusion. In skeletal muscle it is found in all three NCAM isoforms, increasing their MW, giving NCAM-125, NCAM-145, and NCAM-185 isoforms, but is most commonly found in the NCAM-125 isoform.\n【14】 # Posttranslational modification\n【15】 NCAM exhibits glycoforms as it can be posttranslationally modified by the addition of polysialic acid (PSA) to the fifth Ig domain, which is thought to abrogate its homophilic binding properties and can lead to reduced cell adhesion important in cell migration and invasion. PSA has been shown to be critical in learning and memory. Removal of PSA from NCAM by the enzyme endoneuraminidase (EndoN) has been shown to abolish long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD).\n【16】 # Expression in normal cells\n【17】 The neural cell adhesion molecule NCAM1 appears on early embryonic cells and is important in the formation of cell collectives and their boundaries at sites of morphogenesis.\n【18】 Later in development, NCAM1 (CD56) expression is found on various differentiated tissues and is a major CAM mediating adhesion among neurons and between neurons and muscle.\n【19】 # Function\n【20】 NCAM is thought to signal to induce neurite outgrowth via the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) and act upon the p59Fyn signaling pathway.\n【21】 In nerves, NCAM1 regulates homophilic (like-like) interactions between neurons and between neurons and muscle; it associates with fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) and stimulates tyrosine kinase activity of receptor to induce neurite outgrowth. When neural crest cells stop making N-CAM and N-cadherin, and start displaying integrin receptors, cells separate and migrate.\n【22】 During hematopoiesis, CD56 is the prototypic marker of NK cells, also present on subset of CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells.\n【23】 In cell adhesion, CD56 contributes to cell-cell adhesion or cell-matrix adhesion during embryonic development.\n【24】 # Pathology\n【25】 In anatomic pathology, pathologists make use of CD56 immunohistochemistry to recognize certain tumors.\n【26】 - Normal cells that stain positively for CD56 include NK cells, activated T cells, the brain and cerebellum, and neuroendocrine tissues.\n【27】 - Tumors that are CD56-positive are myeloma, myeloid leukemia, neuroendocrine tumors, Wilms' tumor, neuroblastoma, NK/T cell lymphomas, pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, paraganglioma, small cell lung carcinoma, and the Ewing's sarcoma family of tumors.\n【28】 # Alzheimers\n【29】 NCAM2 is found in lower levels in synapses in the hippocampuses of Alzheimers sufferers and is found to be broken down by beta-amyloid\n【30】 # Anti-NCAM therapy\n【31】 NCAM has been used as a target molecule for experimental antibody-based immunotherapy. Successful radioimmunolocalisation of metastases was demonstrated after giving injections of NCAM-binding 123J-UJ13a or 131J-UJ13a radioimmunoconjugates to children with neuroblastoma. Patients with small cell lung cancer were treated with the anti-NCAM immunotoxine huN901-DM1 in two different clinical studies, revealing acceptable toxicity and signs of clinical response.", "title": "Neural cell adhesion molecule", "tags": "", "lang": "", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"overview\": \"None\", \"id\": \"0baacf51386991e7291b787b4ec938f3280eb98d\", \"url\": \"https://www.wikidoc.org/index.php/CD56\", \"source\": \"wikidoc\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-01-28 23:07:59", "update_time": "2024-02-18 19:31:00"}

Gas exchange primarily controls the rate of respiration.\n【3】 The most important function of breathing is gas exchange (of oxygen and carbon dioxide). Thus the control of respiration is centered primarily on how well this is achieved by the lungs.\n【4】 # Control Unit\n【5】 The control unit of ventilation consists of a processor (the breathing centre in the brain) which integrates inputs (emotional, chemical and physical stimuli) and controls an effector (the lungs) via motor nerves arising from the spinal cord. In humans, quiet breathing occurs by the cyclical contraction of the inspiratory muscles, particularly the diaphragm. Inhalation is normally an active process, and exhalation is passive. However, when ventilation is increased (over 40 litres per minute), such as during heavy exercise, muscle activity becomes involved in exhalation. Under these circumstances, the work of breathing over time can exceed the metabolic rate of the rest of the body.\n【6】 # Ventilatory Pattern\n【7】 Ventilation is normally autonomic, with only limited voluntary override, but an exception to this is Ondine's curse, where autonomic control is lost.\n【8】 The pattern neuronal firing when breathing can be divided into inspiratory and expiratory phases. Inspiration shows a sudden ramp increase in motor discharge to the inspiratory muscles (including pharyngeal dilator muscles). Before the end of inspiration, there is a decline in motor discharge. Exhalation is usually silent, except at high minute ventilation rates.\n【9】 The mechanism of generation of the ventilatory pattern is not completely understood, but involves the integration of neural signals by respiratory control centres in the medulla and pons. The nuclei known to be involved are divided into regions known as the following:\n【10】 - medulla (reticular formation)\n【11】 ventral respiratory group (nucleus retroambigualis, nucleus ambiguus, nucleus parambigualis and the pre-Botzinger complex). The ventral respiratory group controls voluntary forced exhalation and acts to increase the force of inspiration.\n【12】 dorsal respiratory group (nucleus tractus solitarius). The dorsal respiratory group controls mostly inspiratory movements and their timing.\n【13】 - ventral respiratory group (nucleus retroambigualis, nucleus ambiguus, nucleus parambigualis and the pre-Botzinger complex). The ventral respiratory group controls voluntary forced exhalation and acts to increase the force of inspiration.\n【14】 - dorsal respiratory group (nucleus tractus solitarius). The dorsal respiratory group controls mostly inspiratory movements and their timing.\n【15】 - pons\n【16】 pneumotaxic centre. The pneumotaxic centre is involved in fine tuning of respiration rate.\n【17】 apneustic centre\n【18】 - pneumotaxic centre. The pneumotaxic centre is involved in fine tuning of respiration rate.\n【19】 - apneustic centre\n【20】 There is further integration in the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord.\n【21】 # Determinants of Ventilatory Rate\n【22】 Ventilatory rate (minute volume) is tightly controlled and determined primarily by blood levels of carbon dioxide as determined by metabolic rate. Blood levels of oxygen become important in hypoxia. These levels are sensed by chemoreceptors in the medulla oblongata for pH, and the carotid and aortic bodies for oxygen and carbon dioxide.  Afferent neurons from the carotid bodies and aortic bodies are via the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX) and the vagus nerve (CN X), respectively. During moderate exercise, ventilation increases in proportion to metabolic production of carbon dioxide. During strenuous exercise, ventilation increases more than needed to compensate for carbon dioxide production. Lactic acid produced during anaerobic metabolism lowers pH and thus increases breathing. In aerobic metabolism, one molecule of acid (CO2) is produced in order to produce 6 molecules of the energy carrier ATP, wheeras in anaerobic metabolism, 6 molecules of lactic acid are produced to produce the same amount of energy.\n【23】 Mechanical stimulation of the lungs can trigger certain reflexes as discovered in animal studies. In humans, these seem to be more important in neonates and ventilated patients, but of little relevance in health. The tone of respiratory muscle is believed to be modulated by muscle spindles via a reflex arc involving the spinal cord.\n【24】 Drugs can greatly influence the control of respiration. Opioids and anaesthetic drugs tend to depress ventilation, especially with regards to Carbon Dioxide response. Stimulants such as Amphetamines can cause hyperventilation.\n【25】 Pregnancy tends to increase ventilation (lowering plasma carbon dioxide tension below normal values). This is due to increased progesterone levels and results in enhanced gas exchange in the placenta.\n【26】 Ventilation is temporarily modified by voluntary acts and complex reflexes such as sneezing, coughing and vomiting.\n【27】 # Feedback control\n【28】 Receptors play important roles in the regulation of respiration; central and peripheral chemoreceptors, and mechanoreceptors.\n【29】 - Central chemoreceptors of the central nervous system, located on the ventrolateral medullary surface, are sensitive to the pH of their environment.\n【30】 - Peripheral chemoreceptors act most importantly to detect variation of the oxygen in the arterial blood, in addition to detecting arterial carbon dioxide and pH.\n【31】 - Mechanoreceptors are located in the airways and parenchyma, and are responsible for a variety of reflex responses.  These include:\n【32】 The Hering-Breuer reflex that terminates inspiration to prevent over inflation of the lungs, and the reflex responses of coughing, airway constriction, and hyperventilation.\n【33】 The upper airway receptors are responsible for reflex responses such as, sneezing, bradycardia, coughing, closure of glottis, and hiccups.\n【34】 The spinal cord reflex responses include the activation of additional respiratory muscles as compensation, gasping response, hypoventilation, and an increase in breathing frequency and volume.\n【35】 - The Hering-Breuer reflex that terminates inspiration to prevent over inflation of the lungs, and the reflex responses of coughing, airway constriction, and hyperventilation.\n【36】 - The upper airway receptors are responsible for reflex responses such as, sneezing, bradycardia, coughing, closure of glottis, and hiccups.\n【37】 - The spinal cord reflex responses include the activation of additional respiratory muscles as compensation, gasping response, hypoventilation, and an increase in breathing frequency and volume.\n【38】 In addition to involuntary control of respiration by the respiratory center, respiration can be affected by conditions such as emotional state, via input from the limbic system, or temperature, via the hypothalamus.

However, this does not rule out the possibility of low formula weight organic salts such as sodium citrate being called bath salts.\n【11】 As with the naming of other additives, mixed preparations consisting largely though not entirely of salts as described herein may be called \"bath salts\".  Commonest additions are fragrances and colors, and one purpose (in some products the most important one) of salts is as a vehicle or diluent to \"stretch\" fragrances, which are otherwise often too potent for convenient measurement or use.  Other common additives to bath salts are oils (agglomerating the salts, the product being called \"bath beads\" or \"bath oil beads\"), foaming agents, and fizzing (effervescent) agents.\n【12】 The appearance of the product before use is sometimes valued, and although bath salts are often packaged for retail in windowless boxes or bags, they may also be displayed in transparent containers.  For instance, the needlelike appearance of sodium sesquicarbonate crystals makes them attractive for such purpose.  However, bath salts may also be prepared as amorphous granules rather than crystals.\n【13】 # Effects of bath salts\n【14】 Epsom salt is the most tested and has many effects on the muscles and nervous system.\n【15】 Bath salts provide a variety of benefits to a bather.  Salts change the osmotic balance of the water so that fewer salts are leeched from the skin via osmosis.  This reduces the \"pruning\" or \"wrinkling\" effect of prolonged exposure of skin to fresh water. Magnesium sulphate has been shown to be absorbed through the skin, and magnesium has an anti-inflammatory effect.\n【16】 Some bath salts such as phosphates have a detergent action which softens calloused skin and aids in exfoliation.\n【17】 Some bath salts act as water softeners and change the way soap behaves and rinses.\n【18】 High concentrations of salts increase the specific gravity of the water and increase buoyancy which makes the body feel lighter in the bath.  Very high concentrations of salts in water are used in flotation therapy.\n【19】 Bath salts are often used to mimic the properties of natural mineral baths or hot springs\n【20】 # Abuse\n【21】 According to a recent study, Bath salts abuse is becoming common, and patients with PABS overdoses are presenting to emergency departments with increasing frequency. The primary ingredient of the synthetic designer drugs in these bath salts, which are not related to any hygiene product, is methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV). MDPV is structurally related to pyrovalerone and α-pyrrolidinophenone compounds that inhibit norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake and thus act as central nervous system stimulants.\n【22】 ## Effect\n【23】 The sympathetic effects may include\n【24】 - tachycardia.\n【25】 - hypertension,\n【26】 - hyperthermia, and\n【27】 - seizures,\n【28】 - deaths have also been reported.\n【29】 Altered mental status presents as\n【30】 - severe panic attacks,\n【31】 - agitation,\n【32】 - paranoia,\n【33】 - hallucinations, and\n【34】 - violent behavior (e.g., self-mutilation,\n【35】 - suicide attempts,\n【36】 - homicidal activity.\n【37】 Thus Psychoactive Bath Salts (PABS) have been described as possessing the worst characteristics of\n【38】 - lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD),\n【39】 - phencyclidine (PCP, or angel dust),\n【40】 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine (ecstasy),\n【41】 - cocaine, and\n【42】 - methamphetamine.\n【43】 ## Treatment\n【44】 It is mainly supportive, typically with:\n【45】 - intravenous benzodiazepines (for sedation, to control seizures, or both) and\n【46】 - intravenous fluids, incase of suspicion of rhabdomyolysis.\n【47】 ## Special Precautions\n【48】 Physicians need to be aware of several issues, which are as follows\n【49】 - Intensive care unit care, because of the severity and potential lethality which can result from overdoses.\n【50】 - Specific drug screen, as routine drug screens do not detect PABS.\n【51】 - Differentiating PABS from other psychoactive substance abuse, which can confound the clinical presentation.\n【52】 - Need of physical restraints and high dose sedatives to prevent self harm and harm to others.", "title": "Bath salts", "tags": "", "lang": "", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"source\": \"wikidoc\", \"id\": \"16e275330ab718f3d0d5135fa092db3715ca36ba\", \"overview\": \"None\", \"url\": \"https://www.wikidoc.org/index.php/Bath_salts\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-01-28 23:07:59", "update_time": "2024-02-18 18:45:19"}

Even so, the disease is very rare and fewer than 500 occurrences of the disease have been reported as of 2005, of which around 148 (including both children and adult cases) were documented to have been from between 1960 and 1992. Less than 0.5% of all splenectomies, surgical removal of the spleen, are performed due to having this disorder.\n【4】 Characteristics of the disorder include the loss, weakening, or malformation of the ligaments that help to keep the spleen located in the upper left part of the abdomen. Though not a genetic disease, wandering spleen is often found at birth. It can occur in  adults as the result of injuries and other similar conditions that cause the ligaments to weaken, such as connective tissue disease or pregnancy.\n【5】 # Symptoms\n【6】 Symptoms include an enlargement in the size of the spleen, or a change from the spleen's original position to another location, usually in either other parts of the abdomen or into the pelvis. This ability to move to other locations is commonly attributed to the spleen's pedicle being abnormally long.\n【7】 Physical factors may cause ischuria, constipation, as well as numerous spleen-related diseases such as hypersplenism, thrombocytopenia, and lymphoma. Blocking of the arteries and torsion in the spleen can also result in abdominal pain or swelling. However, lack of visible symptoms — except in incidents of abdominal pain — makes the disease difficult for doctors to diagnose, though medical imaging techniques such as medical ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging, or computed tomography can be used to confirm its occurrence.\n【8】 # Treatment\n【9】 The disorder must be treated through laparoscopic surgery, due to the possibility of blocked arteries in the spleen. The usual treatment is splenopexy, fixation of the spleen, but if there is no blood flow after unwinding the spleen through detorsion then splenectomy must be performed. Although there have been few reported cases of treatment through laparoscopic surgery due to the rarity of the disease, it has been proven to be an effective surgical technique.\n【10】 # Notes and references\n【11】 - ↑ Jump up to: 1.0 1.1 1.2 Hasan Alawi, Malak (October–December 2005). \"Wandering Spleen: A Challenging Diagnosis\" (PDF).

People in the clinical trial and Cancer Drugs Fund followed a stopping rule which meant they stopped treatment at 22 months and 24 months respectively, or earlier if their disease progressed. There are no trials directly comparing cemiplimab with best supportive care. But an indirect comparison suggests that people taking cemiplimab are likely to live longer than people having best supportive care. There is still not enough data from the Cancer Drugs Fund and the trial to be certain by how much cemiplimab increases the length of time people live.\n【10】 Because of the uncertainty with the clinical data, the cost-effectiveness estimates are also uncertain. The life expectancy of people with advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma receiving best supportive care, and the evidence for how long life might be extended with cemiplimab, meet the end of life criteria. Therefore, the most likely cost-effectiveness estimates fall within what NICE considers an acceptable use of NHS resources. So, cemiplimab is recommended for routine use.# Information about cemiplimab\n【11】 # Conditional marketing authorisation indication\n【12】 Cemiplimab (Libtayo, Sanofi) 'as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic or locally advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma who are not candidates for curative surgery or curative radiation'.\n【13】 # Dosage in the marketing authorisation\n【14】 The dosage schedule is available in the summary of product characteristics for cemiplimab.\n【15】 # Price\n【16】 The list price for cemiplimab is £4,650 per 350 mg vial (excluding VAT; BNF online accessed April 2022). The cost per course of treatment is £4,650. The cost for 1 year of treatment with cemiplimab based on the list price is £80,877.\n【17】 The company has a commercial arrangement. This makes cemiplimab available to the NHS with a discount. The size of the discount is commercial in confidence. It is the company's responsibility to let relevant NHS organisations know details of the discount.# Committee discussion\n【18】 The appraisal committee considered evidence submitted by the company, a review of this submission by the evidence review group (ERG), and responses from stakeholders. See the committee papers for full details of the evidence.\n【19】 This review looks at data collected in the Cancer Drugs Fund to address uncertainties identified during the original appraisal. Further information about the original appraisal is in the committee papers. Data was collected on the use of cemiplimab in the NHS through the Cancer Drugs Fund using the Systemic Anti-Cancer Therapy (SACT) dataset. As a condition of the Cancer Drugs Fund's managed access agreement, the company was required to collect updated efficacy data from the EMPOWER-CSCC 1 study for people with metastatic or locally advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. The company also collected data on the effectiveness of treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy and with best supportive care in the UK through a retrospective chart review.\n【20】 # Clinical need and current management\n【21】 ## Living with advanced unresectable cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma is physically and emotionally challenging\n【22】 Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) is a distinct disease that differs from malignant melanoma and other squamous cell carcinomas such as primary head and neck or lung squamous cell carcinoma. Risk factors include exposure to ultraviolet radiation, increasing age, and immunosuppression. Early CSCC can be cured in most people, but in a small proportion of people the disease reaches an advanced state (metastatic or locally advanced) that cannot be removed with surgery (unresectable) or cured with radiotherapy. Often, people with advanced disease are older, have other comorbidities, and have a poor prognosis. The skin lesions can grow to be quite large and the disease can spread to different parts of the body. Because of the link with ultraviolet exposure, the lesions often develop on parts of the body that are visible, such as the face. The patient expert described how advanced CSCC can be extremely debilitating because it can result in unpleasant foul-smelling wounds. Living with advanced unresectable CSCC is challenging and, because of the visibility of the disease, it often results in people avoiding social interaction. Caring for a person with CSCC can be physically and emotionally draining. The committee concluded that living with advanced unresectable CSCC is physically and emotionally challenging for both people with the disease and their carers.\n【23】 ## Best supportive care is the most appropriate comparator\n【24】 The company presented clinical and cost-effectiveness evidence for cemiplimab compared with platinum-based chemotherapy and best supportive care. The clinical experts stated that very few people aged over 70 would be offered platinum-based chemotherapy in the NHS, because of its side effects and lack of clinical benefit. People with advanced CSCC are typically older, and therefore are less likely to be able to tolerate platinum-based chemotherapy. The committee heard from the NHS England expert that in the SACT dataset 75% of people were aged 70 and above and 36% were aged 80 and above. The clinical experts stated that in their experience, the number of people who receive chemotherapy is less than 5%, and probably less than 2%. The patient expert stated that there are limited treatment options for this patient group, very few patients are offered radiotherapy and this rarely works. Therefore, treatment for most people with advanced unresectable CSCC is limited to best supportive care. The committee agreed that platinum-based chemotherapy is not routinely used for treating advanced unresectable CSCC in the NHS and therefore concluded that best supportive care is the most appropriate comparator for this appraisal.\n【25】 ## Cemiplimab is a highly valued and well tolerated treatment option for people with advanced unresectable CSCC\n【26】 The clinical and patient experts described the substantial burden of advanced unresectable CSCC on quality of life and the lack of current treatment options. One clinical expert emphasised that because local disease can result in large, fungating tumours, it is particularly important to also consider progression-free survival when assessing the benefits of cemiplimab. The committee also heard that people who respond to cemiplimab can experience substantial benefits, that tumours shrink, and some people remain disease free for 2 years. In addition, the committee heard that single agent immunotherapies are generally well tolerated, including in older people. One of the clinical experts stated that the most common side effects of cemiplimab are fatigue and rashes, which can be easily resolved. Some people can experience more serious autoimmune side effects. These are generally manageable and can be resolved with high-dose steroids or by having a treatment break. The committee noted cemiplimab's benefits for those who respond and concluded that cemiplimab is a highly valued treatment option for people with advanced unresectable CSCC.\n【27】 # Clinical evidence\n【28】 ## Trial data for cemiplimab is promising but it has not been directly compared with other treatments\n【29】 Data on response and survival outcomes for cemiplimab was reported in 2 single-arm trials: a phase 1 trial and an ongoing phase 2 trial known as EMPOWER-CSCC 1. The phase 1 trial included 26 people with metastatic and locally advanced CSCC who had a cemiplimab dose of 3 mg per kg every 2 weeks for up to 48 weeks. In EMPOWER-CSCC 1, two groups of people had a cemiplimab dose of 3 mg per kg every 2 weeks with a stopping rule which stopped treatment at 96 weeks (22 months), or sooner if disease progressed. One of the groups had metastatic CSCC (59 people) and the other had locally advanced CSCC (78 people). A third group of 56 people with metastatic CSCC had the licensed cemiplimab dose of 350 mg every 3 weeks, with a stopping rule of up to 54 weeks, or sooner if disease progressed. The results were consistent between groups and the company presented this data pooled together in a base-case integrated analysis population. Across the 219 people included in the pooled company trials, 40% had locally advanced disease and 60% had metastatic disease. The median age was 72 years and 83% of people were male. All the people in the company trials had an Eastern Cooperative Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 (44% of people) or 1 (56% of people). At the October 2019 data cut-off for EMPOWER-CSCC 1, the objective response rate was 46.1% (95% confidence interval 38.9% to 53.4%) and median overall survival had not been reached after a median follow up of 15.7 months. The company submitted the results from the most recent data cut in July 2021, however these are academic in confidence and cannot be presented in full here. Median overall survival had not been reached at the July 2021 data cut-off. The committee concluded that the trial data for cemiplimab is promising because of the response rate seen in the trial population, but it has not been compared with other treatments, and the long-term overall survival benefit is uncertain.\n【30】 ## There are differences between the cemiplimab trial data and SACT dataset, so there is uncertainty about whether the cemiplimab trial results are generalisable to UK clinical practice\n【31】 Through the Cancer Drugs Fund, SACT data was collected from people having a cemiplimab dose of 350 mg every 3 weeks for metastatic or locally advanced CSCC in UK clinical practice. Between 2 July 2019 and 1 March 2021, 352 people had cemiplimab with a stopping rule of up to 24 months, or sooner if disease progressed, with a median follow up of 10.2 months. People in the SACT dataset had a median age of 77 years, 81% had an ECOG performance status score of 0 or 1, and 49% of people had locally advanced disease. Median overall survival in the SACT population was 21 months. The ERG noted that people in the SACT dataset were older than in the company trials and that overall survival was lower. Therefore the ERG expressed concerns about the generalisability of the company trials to UK clinical practice. The company stated that the SACT data shows that older and sicker patients could be treated with cemiplimab. The company also highlighted that there are limitations with the SACT dataset, including the unknown impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, limited information on patient characteristics and the shorter follow up compared with the company trials. The company stated that this makes it difficult to determine the generalisability of the company trials to UK practice using the SACT dataset. The clinical experts explained that clinical trials typically include a more selected population in terms of age and fitness, therefore results are expected to be more favourable than in clinical practice. In addition, it is likely that the COVID-19 pandemic impacted treatment with cemiplimab in the SACT dataset, for example, through missed doses, people presenting later in the disease course and mortality because of COVID-19. However, the extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is unknown, resulting in additional uncertainty. The clinical experts also stated that the SACT dataset is immature and included people treated by clinicians with little or no experience of using cemiplimab. The clinical experts expected that clinical outcomes with cemiplimab would improve as clinicians become more experienced and learn who should be treated with cemiplimab and when to start treatment. The committee discussed whether the lower overall survival in the SACT dataset than in the trial population may be because of the reduced life expectancy of the older population in the SACT dataset. It discussed the possibility of more deaths from non-cancer causes, but noted that this was uncertain because the SACT data does not include cause of death, and neither the SACT data nor the company clinical trials included comparator arms. The committee agreed that there were differences in the patient characteristics and the outcomes between the clinical trials and the SACT dataset and concluded that it was uncertain whether the cemiplimab clinical trial results are generalisable to UK clinical practice.\n【32】 ## The overall survival estimates with best supportive care are very uncertain\n【33】 Comparator data in advanced CSCC is extremely limited. Because chemotherapy is not considered to be a relevant comparator for this appraisal (see section 3.2), only the evidence for best supportive care is discussed here. The company conducted a retrospective chart review to address the lack of comparative evidence that was highlighted during the original appraisal. The chart review was done between 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2015 and included 106 people with metastatic or locally advanced CSCC in the UK. However, both the company and the ERG agreed that the chart review lacks face validity, because of concerns about the comparability of the chart review population and the EMPOWER-CSCC 1 population. Also, the population characteristics and results were highly uncertain. In addition, very few people included in the chart review had CSCC that was eligible for best supportive care. Therefore, the analysis was limited to people receiving chemotherapy, which was not considered to be a relevant comparator by the committee. In the company's base-case analysis, the estimates for the clinical effectiveness of best supportive care were based on evidence from a non-UK retrospective chart review (Sun et al. 2019). Data was used from a subset of 20 non-immunocompromised people with unresectable head and neck CSCC. Patient characteristics were not reported for this specific subset, however patient characteristics of the wider study population were generally similar to the cemiplimab trials. The median overall survival in the subset of non-immunocompromised people receiving best supportive care was 5 months. A committee member suggested that these reviews may reflect clinical practice better than a clinical trial. However, the company explained that the estimates of survival for best supportive care from the Sun et al. chart review are likely to be more favourable than in clinical practice. This is because the Sun et al. study included a highly selected population who were treated in academic treatment centres. The ERG agreed that the study population was highly selected and noted that the results are very uncertain because of the small study population. The clinical expert explained that there is a lack of survival data for people with advanced CSCC, partly because the lack of treatment options means that people are usually discharged back to primary care and are not followed up in the hospital setting. The committee concluded that the estimates of survival with best supportive care are very uncertain.\n【34】 # Indirect comparisons\n【35】 ## None of the indirect comparisons provide a reliable estimate of cemiplimab's effectiveness\n【36】 There are no available studies directly comparing cemiplimab with best supportive care, so the company did an indirect treatment comparison (ITC). For the comparison of cemiplimab with best supportive care the company explored 2 ITC methods: a simulated treatment comparison (STC) and a matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC). The company also presented the results of a naive comparison, which fitted survival extrapolations directly to the observed data. The results from all 3 methods suggest that people who had cemiplimab had a longer overall survival than people who had best supportive care. The ERG noted that the company's approach to the ITC was systematic and in line with the recommendations in the technical support document published by the Decision Support Unit. The committee noted that the ITC is based on comparator data that is considered highly uncertain and concluded that none of the indirect comparisons provide a reliable estimate of relative effectiveness. However, the committee agreed that it was likely that cemiplimab extended survival compared with best supportive care.\n【37】 # The company's economic model\n【38】 ## The company model is suitable for decision-making\n【39】 As in the original appraisal, the company modelled cost effectiveness using a partitioned survival model with 3 health states (pre-progression, post-progression and death). The model had a 30‑year time horizon and a monthly cycle length with a half-cycle correction. A 2‑year stopping rule was applied for cemiplimab which is similar to the 22‑month stopping rule applied for 2 of the groups in the EMPOWER-CSCC 1 study (see section 3.4) and was agreed in TA592. The company extended the assumed duration of effectiveness of cemiplimab from the original appraisal to align with the longer duration of follow up from EMPOWER-CSCC 1 and updated the quality-of-life data with the most recent data cut. The company model used the baseline characteristics from the company trials in its base case. However, after technical engagement, the company updated the baseline characteristics to those from the SACT dataset. This aligned with the ERG's preference, as this reflects the population who had cemiplimab in NHS practice. The company presented cost-effectiveness estimates for cemiplimab compared with chemotherapy and best supportive care. However, because best supportive care was agreed as the most appropriate comparator in this appraisal (see section 3.2), the cost-effectiveness results for cemiplimab compared with chemotherapy were not discussed further. The committee concluded that the company model is suitable for decision-making.\n【40】 ## Survival extrapolations for cemiplimab and best supportive care are highly uncertain, but cemiplimab is likely to extend survival\n【41】 The ERG noted that there is a high degree of uncertainty in the survival extrapolations for cemiplimab and best supportive care, because of limitations in the data (see sections 3.4 to 3.6). The committee noted that the ERG used the same survival extrapolations as the company in its base case, and explored a range of alternative extrapolations in scenario analyses. The committee was not presented with the SACT overall survival Kaplan–Meier data for comparison against the results from the company's trials and the modelled extrapolations. The committee noted that overall survival data from the SACT dataset has been used in economic modelling in other appraisals. The committee agreed that a scenario analysis using the overall survival estimates from the SACT Kaplan–Meier curve would have been helpful to quantify the uncertainty of the survival estimates for cemiplimab, given the lower overall survival in the SACT dataset than in the clinical trials. The committee concluded that the survival extrapolations for cemiplimab and best supportive care are highly uncertain. However, despite the uncertainties, the committee agreed that it was likely that cemiplimab did extend survival, although the extent to which is uncertain.\n【42】 # End of life\n【43】 ## Cemiplimab for advanced unresectable CSCC meets the end of life criteria\n【44】 The committee considered the advice about life-extending treatments for people with a short life expectancy in NICE's guide to the methods of technology appraisal. In the company's and ERG's base-case analysis, the mean life expectancy for people receiving best supportive care was 1.42 life years. The committee also noted that the median life expectancy of people receiving best supportive care in the Sun et al. (2019) study was 5 months. The committee was satisfied that the life expectancy in this population was less than 24 months, despite the uncertainty in the evidence base for best supportive care. It was also satisfied that cemiplimab offers at least a 3‑month life extension, based on the evidence from the SACT dataset and the clinical trials, despite the uncertainties. Therefore, the committee concluded that cemiplimab for advanced CSCC that cannot be removed with surgery (unresectable) or cured with radiotherapy meets the end of life criteria.\n【45】 # Cost-effectiveness estimates\n【46】 ## The cost-effectiveness estimates for cemiplimab are uncertain but are likely to fall within what NICE considers an acceptable use of NHS resources\n【47】 At technical engagement, the company accepted the ERG's preferred assumptions in its base case. Both the company's and the ERG's base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for cemiplimab compared with best supportive care was £30,952 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. All the ICERs from the company and ERG scenario analyses were lower than £50,000 per QALY gained. The committee noted the significant uncertainty around the clinical effectiveness of cemiplimab in the NHS (see section 3.5) and that overall survival from the SACT dataset had not been used in the economic modelling (see section 3.9). The committee was also aware of the substantial uncertainty surrounding the comparator data for best supportive care and the indirect comparison (see sections 3.6 and 3.7). The committee considered its conclusion that the end of life criteria were met for cemiplimab. Because of the high level of uncertainty in the clinical evidence, the committee agreed that an acceptable ICER should be towards the lower end of the range normally considered a cost-effective use of NHS resources. Taking all of this into account, the committee concluded that cemiplimab was an acceptable use of NHS resources.\n【48】 # Other issues\n【49】 ## Innovation\n【50】 Cemiplimab is considered innovative because it potentially provides a new treatment option for people who currently have limited access to any life-extending treatment. Cemiplimab is therefore considered a step-change in the treatment of advanced CSCC that cannot be removed with surgery or cured with radiotherapy.\n【51】 ## Equalities\n【52】 No equality issues were identified.\n【53】 # Conclusion\n【54】 ## Cemiplimab is recommended for routine use\n【55】 The committee concluded that, while there is significant uncertainty in the survival estimates for cemiplimab and best supportive care, the most likely cost-effectiveness estimates are within what NICE considers an acceptable use of NHS resources. Therefore, cemiplimab is recommend as an option for treating metastatic or locally advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma in adults when curative surgery or curative radiotherapy is not appropriate, if it is stopped at 24 months, or earlier if disease progresses.", "title": "Cemiplimab for treating advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma", "tags": "", "lang": "", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"overview\": \"Evidence-based recommendations on cemiplimab (Libtayo) for metastatic or locally advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma in adults.\", \"url\": \"https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ta802\", \"id\": \"86956d81afc9599dc89013197972120dd7965e6d\", \"source\": \"nice\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-01-28 23:07:59", "update_time": "2024-02-18 19:14:29"}

Many of these emergencies involved some degree of forced population migration, and almost all have been associated with severe food shortages. Natural disasters, such as droughts and floods, have been partially responsible, but the most common causes of these emergencies have been war and civil strife. Since 1984, the number of refugees dependent for their survival on international assistance has more than doubled to a current estimate of approximately 17 million persons --almost all in developing countries. Kurdish refugees fleeing Iraq captured the world's attention briefly in early 1991, but the desperate plight of many others --especially the 5 million refugees in Africa --receives scant attention from the world media. Even more obscure are the estimated 16-20 million displaced persons who are trapped within their countries by civil wars and are unable to cross borders to seek help from the international community. This situation represents an unprecedented challenge to the international public health community.\n【3】 CDC has had a long-standing institutional commitment to the problem of famine-affected, refugee, and displaced populations for many years. During the Nigerian Civil War in the 1960s, 20 Epidemic Intelligence Service officers helped maintain public health programs for millions of displaced civilians, who were deprived of their basic needs by that war. Since then, CDC has provided technical assistance to relief agencies working in most of the world's major refugee emergency communities including those in, for example, Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Pakistan, Somalia, Sudan, Thailand, Turkey, and West Africa. CDC, United Nations agencies, countries of asylum, and private voluntary organizations (PVOs) have attempted to adapt traditional epidemiologic techniques and public health programs to the realities of refugee camps and scattered, famine-affected communities. As a result, a considerable body of knowledge and experience has accumulated and has been documented in various issues of the MMWR. This report represents a compilation of this knowledge for dissemination and for providing guidance on certain technical subjects for those involved in future relief programs.\n【4】 By necessity, this document is unable to cover all aspects of emergency relief. The recommendations provided here will not be effective unless they are supported by adequate preparedness planning, coordination, communications, logistics, personnel management, and relief worker training. Even more critical is ensuring access by relief workers to internally displaced populations --many needy communities are caught in areas of contested sovereignty. Unless the international community can devise ways of providing assistance to communities in these circumstances, it will be impossible to implement these basic public health programs. Finally, the situation of refugees and displaced persons is a timely reminder of the clear interface between public health and social justice. The most effective measure to prevent the high mortality experienced by these populations would be to eliminate the causes of the violence and conflict from which they fled.\n【5】 # INTRODUCTION\n【6】 During the past three decades, the most common emergencies affecting the health of large populations in developing countries have involved famine and forced migrations. The public health consequences of mass population displacement have been extensively documented. On some occasions, these migrations have resulted in extremely high rates of mortality, morbidity, and malnutrition. The most severe consequences of population displacement have occurred during the acute emergency phase, when relief efforts are in the early stage. During this phase, deaths --in some cases --were 60 times the crude mortality rate (CMR) among non-refugee populations in the country of origin (1). Although the quality of international disaster response efforts has steadily improved, the human cost of forced migration remains high.\n【7】 Since the early 1960s, most emergencies involving refugees and displaced persons have taken place in less developed countries where local resources have been insufficient for providing prompt and adequate assistance. The international community's response to the health needs of these populations has been at times inappropriate, relying on teams of foreign medical personnel with little or no training. Hospitals, clinics, and feeding centers have been set up without assessment of preliminary needs, and essential prevention programs have been neglected. More recent relief programs, however, emphasize a primary health care (PHC) approach, focusing on preventive programs such as immunization and oral rehydration therapy (ORT), promoting involvement by the refugee community in the provision of health services, and stressing more effective coordination and information gathering. The PHC approach offers long-term advantages, not only for the directly affected population, but also for the country hosting the refugees. A PHC strategy is sustainable and strengthens the national health development program.\n【8】 # BACKGROUND\n【9】 # Classification of Disasters\n【10】 One way of describing the evolution of disasters is in terms of a \"trigger event\" leading to \"primary effects\" and \"secondary effects\" on vulnerable groups in the population (2). In the case of a rapid-onset natural disaster like an earthquake, the primary effects, deaths and injuries, may be high, but there are few secondary effects. In the case of slow-onset natural disasters like drought and manmade disasters, like war and civil strife, the secondary effects (i.e., decreased food availability, environmental damage, and population displacement) may lead to a higher delayed death toll than that of the initial event. Although population displacement may result from a number of different types of disasters --manmade and natural --the two most common recent trigger events have been food deficits and war. In many parts of the world where food shortages have become common, war and civil strife are major causative factors. Consequently, war, food deficits, famine, and population displacement have been inextricably linked risk factors for increased mortality in certain large populations in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East.\n【11】 The purpose of this report is to describe the public health consequences of famine and population displacement in developing countries and to present the most current recommendations on public health programs of major importance.\n【12】 indicators and are not useful for early famine detection and the initiation of prevention or mitigation measures. More important in the early detection of famine are \"leading\" and \"intermediate\" indicators that reflect changes in the economic, social, and environmental factors that influence the evolution of food shortages and famine.\n【13】 The leading and intermediate indicators will be useful if they trigger early interventions aimed at ensuring adequate food supplies for the population and at maintaining the purchasing power of vulnerable groups. These measures have included temporary government subsidies for food crops, \"food-for-work\" programs; government-run, fixed-price food shops; rural employment schemes; the distribution of drought-resistant seeds; and the release of food reserves.\n【14】 Effective early warning systems might help avert major population movements, thereby allowing local government and international and private voluntary organizations (PVOs) to provide assistance in situ without major disruption in traditional social structures and lifestyle patterns. Affected communities can be surveyed, needy households identified, food and other relief supplies distributed, and major epidemics averted with greater ease and effectiveness in a stable population than in a temporary refugee settlement. National early warning systems have proved effective in preventing famine during the past decade in India and Botswana (8).\n【15】 When populations are forced to migrate en masse, they usually end up in camps or urban slums characterized by overcrowding, poor sanitation, substandard housing, and limited access to health services. These conditions hamper the effective and equitable distribution of relief supplies and promote the transmission of communicable diseases.\n【16】 # REPORTS\n【17】 The most direct and obvious results of famine are severe undernutrition and death. While longitudinal studies have demonstrated that undernourished persons --particularly children -are at higher risk of mortality, the immediate cause of death is usually a communicable disease. Malnutrition causes an increased case-fatality ratio (CFR) in the most common childhood communicable diseases (i.e., measles, diarrheal disease, malaria, and acute respiratory infections (ARIs)). Those at highest risk of mortality during nonfamine times -namely, the poor, the elderly, women, and young children --are the same groups most at risk for the morbidity and mortality caused by famine. In addition, the movement of populations into crowded and unsanitary camps, the violence associated with forced migrations, and the negative psychological effects of fear, uncertainty, and dependency contribute to the health problems experienced by displaced persons.\n【18】 # Mortality\n【19】 Mortality rates are the most specific indicators of the health status of emergency-affected populations. Mortality rates have been estimated retrospectively from hospital and burial records, or from community-based surveys, and prospectively from 24-hour burial site surveillance. Among the many problems encountered in estimating mortality under emergency conditions are recall bias in surveys, families' failure to report perinatal deaths, inaccurate denominators (overall population size, births, age-specific populations), and lack of standard reporting procedures. In general, bias tends to underestimate mortality rates, since deaths are usually underreported or undercounted, and population size is often exaggerated. Most reports of famine-related mortality have come from populations that have experienced considerable displacement. It is possible that mortality rates are lower in those populations that remain in their original villages and homes. A comparison of mortality in displaced vs. nondisplaced, famine-affected populations is problematic because displacement itself may reflect a more serious baseline situation. Nonetheless, comparisons between displaced and nondisplaced populations during famine on one hand, and between refugees and local, host country populations on the other hand, show that in nearly all cases the displaced and refugee populations experience a markedly higher CMR.\n【20】 The CMRs reported in various refugee, internally displaced, and famine-affected (but nondisplaced) populations, respectively, during the emergency phase of relief operations in the past 15 years are listed in Tables 2, 3, and 4. These rates are compared with baseline CMRs reported for nonfamine-affected and nondisplaced populations, or, in the case of refugees, with CMRs in their country of origin. CMRs in these tables are expressed as deaths per 1,000 per month to reflect the short reporting periods; comparison rates have been extrapolated from annual CMRs published by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) (13). Although CMRs reported in refugee emergencies have not been adjusted for age and sex, it is unlikely that demographic differences between refugee and non-refugee populations account for the excess mortality found among many of the latter.\n【21】 Monthly CMRs recorded immediately after the initial influx of Cambodian refugees into Thailand (1979) Somalia (1980) andin Sudan (1985). In eastern Ethiopia in 1988-1989, initially low mortality rates among Somali refugees increased after 6 months, reaching a peak at 9 months (Figure 3). Overall, less than 1% of Cambodian refugees in Thai camps died during the first 12 months; 9% of refugees in eastern Sudan died during the same period of time (1).\n【22】 Political and security factors often obstruct the accurate documentation of death rates among internally displaced populations; however, a few situations have been well documented. In Mozambique (1983), Ethiopia (1984-1985, and Sudan (1988), CMRs estimated by surveillance or population-based surveys of internally displaced persons ranged between 4 and 70 times the death rates in nondisplaced populations in the same country. In the Korem area of Ethiopia, CMRs recorded among camp populations displaced by famine in 1985 were 7-10 times those of settled villagers in a similar highland zone affected by the famine. In Monrovia, the capital of Liberia, the death rate among civilians displaced during the 1990 civil war was 7 times the pre-war death rate (Holland MSF, unpublished data, January 1991).\n【23】 As in stable populations in developing countries, age-specific death rates in displaced and refugee populations are highest in children less than 5 years of age. A mortality survey of Kurdish refugees at the Turkey-Iraq border during 1991 revealed that 63% of all deaths occurred among children less than 5 years of age, who comprised approximately 18% of the population (11). Although absolute death rates are highest in infants less than 1 year of age, the relative increase in mortality during emergencies may be highest in children 1-12 years of age (1).\n【24】 # Cause-specific mortality\n【25】 The major reported causes of death in refugee and displaced populations have been those same diseases that cause high death rates in nondisplaced populations in developing countries: malnutrition, diarrheal diseases, measles, ARIs, and malaria. These diseases consistently account for 60%-95% of all reported causes of death in these populations (Figures 4,5,and 6). Specific reports on these and other communicable diseases are presented in a later section.\n【26】 In those situations where malnutrition was not classified as an immediate cause of death (i.e., Sudan and Somalia), it was a major underlying factor accounting for the high CFRs from communicable diseases. This synergism between high malnutrition prevalence and increased incidence of communicable diseases explains much of the excess mortality seen in refugee and displaced populations.\n【27】 A study of 42 refugee populations completed in 1989 examined acute protein energy malnutrition (PEM) prevalence and crude unadjusted monthly mortality rates, gathered from 1984-1988. Analysis of the data showed a strong positive association between PEM prevalence and CMRs. Populations with PEM prevalence rates of less than 5% had a mean CMR of 0.9/1,000/month. Refugee populations with PEM prevalences of greater than or equal to 40%, however, experienced a mean CMR of 37/1,000/month with a range of 4/1,000/month to 177/1,000/month (Figure 7). The rate ratio between the lowest and highest CMR values was 40. 7 (14).\n【28】 The close correlation between malnutrition prevalence and crude mortality during a relief operation for Somali refugees in eastern Ethiopia in 1988-1989 is clearly demonstrated in Figure 8. Malnutrition prevalence was estimated by serial, cross-sectional, cluster sample surveys of children less than 5 years of age, and monthly death rates were estimated retrospectively by a population-based survey in August 1989. During the period of high malnutrition prevalence and high mortality (March-May 1989), food rations provided an average of approximately 1,400 kilocalories (kcal)/person/day instead of the recommended minimum of 1,900 kcal/person/day (9). Likewise, in eastern Sudan in 1985, inadequate amounts of food (1,870 kcal/person/day) were distributed to Ethiopian refugees during the first 5 months after their arrival in the camps. Malnutrition rates, as well as mortality rates, remained high during this period (Figure 3) (Table 5). In addition, a severe measles outbreak in the Sudanese camps added to the high mortality (21).\n【29】 # Nutritional Diseases\n【30】 Protein-energy malnutrition PEM can refer to either acute or chronic undernutrition. Because children less than 5 years of age are among the most acutely affected by undernutrition, assessment of this age group by anthropometry is usually done to determine PEM prevalence in a population (see \"Indicators of Acute Undernutrition\"). In general, acute undernutrition results in wasting and is assessed by an index of weight-for-height (WFH); however, edema of the extremities may be associated with acute undernutrition in which case, a clinical assessment is necessary. Chronic undernutrition produces stunting and typically results in a diminished height-for-age index.\n【31】 The prevalence of moderate to severe acute undernutrition in a random sample of children less than 5 years of age is generally a reliable indicator of this condition in a population. Since weight is more sensitive to sudden changes in food availability than height, nutritional assessments during emergencies focus on measuring WFH. Also, WFH is a more appropriate measurement for ongoing monitoring of the effectiveness of feeding programs. As a screening measurement, the mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) may also be used to assess acute undernutrition, although there is not complete agreement on which cutoff values should be used as indicators. Nutritional assessment methods are fully described in the Rapid Nutrition Assessment Manual - Anthropometric indices such as WFH and height-for-age are interpreted by comparison with a \"reference population\". Index values are assigned a \"Z-score\" based on the number of standard deviations above or below the median value in the reference population. Currently, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of the CDC/NCHS reference population for nutritional assessments in all countries (22). Before the mid-1980's, anthropometric data was reported as a percentage of the median of the reference population value. Current international guidelines, however, recommend the use of Z-scores to report nutritional assessment data. Tables in this report define acute undernutrition on the basis of percentage median in order to allow comparisons of recent data with data from surveys performed before the mid-1980s.\n【32】 In a well-nourished population in which WFH values are distributed normally (i.e., the reference population), approximately 3% of children less than 5 years of age will have WFH Z-scores of less than -2. For less developed countries with lower \"normal\" nutritional intake levels, 5% of the children may have a Z-score less than -2 when compared with the reference population median, particularly at certain times of the year. Relief organizations agree that a nutritional emergency exists if greater than 8% of the children sampled have a Z-score less than -2. An excess of even 1% of children with Z-scores less than -3 indicates a need for immediate action. Acute PEM prevalence rates have been high in recent famine-affected populations, especially in Africa (Table 6).\n【33】 In addition, acute undernutrition prevalence rates have been elevated in many displaced and refugee populations during the past 12 years, ranging as high as 50% in eastern Sudan in 1985 (Tables 5 and 7). PEM rates have decreased rapidly in situations where effective emergency relief operations have been mounted promptly, i.e., Thailand (1979) andPakistan (1980). However, in other emergencies, such as in Somalia (1980) and Sudan (1985), PEM rates have remained high (greater than 20%) for 6-8 months. Of even greater concern is the observation that acute undernutrition rates among Somali refugees in Ethiopia (1988Ethiopia ( -1989 actually increased 6 months after a relief program was launched. Although most high acute undernutrition prevalence has been associated with inadequate food rations, it appears that malnutrition developed among Kurdish children 1-2 years of age in Turkey within a period of 1-2 months, primarily because of the high incidence of diarrheal diseases in the camps (10). Among internally displaced civilian populations, high PEM prevalence has been associated with the intentional use of food as a weapon by competing military forces (30).\n【34】 The use of serial anthropometry surveys as monitoring tools has certain limitations when mortality rates are high. For example, an analysis of anthropometric data from two crosssectional surveys in a refugee camp in Sudan in 1985 initially implied a relatively stable nutritional situation. In January, the prevalence of acute malnutrition in children less than 5 years of age was 26.3%; in March, the rate was 28.4%. During these two months, almost 13% of the children in the camp died, mainly from measles and diarrheal diseases. In this instance, the elevated child mortality rate masked diminished nutritional status in the population. Many malnourished children in the first survey, who had died, were \"replaced\" in the second survey sample by surviving children whose nutritional status had meanwhile deteriorated (31). Thus, anthropometry data need to be interpreted in the context of concurrent mortality rates.\n【35】 # Micronutrient deficiency diseases\n【36】 In addition to PEM, micronutrient deficiencies play a key role in nutrition-related morbidity and mortality. The importance of micronutrient deficiencies in famine-affected and displaced populations has recently been extensively documented. In addition to deficiencies of vitamin A and iron, conditions widely recognized as important childhood problems in developing countries (i.e., epidemics of scurvy and pellagra) have also been reported in refugee populations during the past decade (Table 8).\n【37】 # Vitamin A deficiency\n【38】 The most common deficiency syndrome in emergency affected populations is caused by lack of vitamin A. Ocular signs of vitamin A deficiency --known as xerophthalmia --include night blindness and Bitot's spots in the earlier stages. Xerophthalmia progresses to corneal xerosis, ulceration and scarring, and eventually blindness. Signs of xerophthalmia were detected in 7% of children surveyed in one region of Somalia during the drought of 1986-1987 (27); 2.1% in drought-affected Niger in 1985 (24); 4.3% among Kampuchean refugees in Thailand (36); and 2.7% in a region of Mauritania in 1984 (23). Recent data suggest that vitamin A deficiency is linked with high childhood mortality (37-38).\n【39】 Famine-affected and displaced populations often have low levels of dietary vitamin A intake before experiencing famine or displacement, and therefore, may have very low vitamin A reserves. Furthermore, the typical rations provided in large-scale relief operations lack vitamin A, putting these populations at high risk. In addition, some communicable diseases that are highly incident in refugee camps --measles and diarrheal diseases --rapidly deplete vitamin A stores. Depleted vitamin A stores need to be adequately replenished during recovery from these diseases to prevent the deficiency from becoming clinically important.\n【40】 # Vitamin C deficiency (scurvy)\n【41】 Although scurvy has been reported rarely in stable populations in developing countries, many outbreaks have occurred in displaced and famine-affected populations in recent years, primarily because of inadequate vitamin C in rations. In 1981, an outbreak of more than 2,000 cases of scurvy occurred in the refugee camps of the Gedo region of Somalia. These Ethiopian refugees had traditionally obtained sufficient dietary vitamin C from camel's milk.\n【42】 Once in refugee camps they subsisted on a ration devoid of vitamin C. The outbreak was precipitated when local markets, where refugees had exchanged rations for fresh fruit and vegetables, were suddenly closed (39).\n【43】 Active surveillance for scurvy among Ethiopian refugees in Somalia and Sudan in 1987 revealed cumulative incidence rates of up to 19.8% in some camps, with initial onset reported between 3-10 months after the arrival of the refugees (32). Cross-sectional surveys performed in 1986-1987 reported point prevalence rates as high as 45% among females and 36% among males; prevalence increased with age. The prevalence of scurvy was associated with the period of residence in camps, and the time exposed to rations lacking in vitamin C. In 1989, a population survey of children less than 5 years of age in Hartisheik camp in eastern Ethiopia in 1989 found the prevalence of clinical scurvy to be 2% (19). The international community has not developed an adequate strategy to prevent scurvy in refugee camps at the Horn of Africa, as demonstrated by an outbreak that took place among adult males (former Ethiopian soldiers) in a camp in eastern Sudan during 1991 (Bhatia R, personal communication, October 1991).\n【44】 # Niacin deficiency\n【45】 Pellagra is the condition resulting from a severe deficiency of biologically available niacin in the diet. Once common in the southeastern United States, Italy, and Spain, pellagra now occurs mainly in maize-or sorghum-consuming populations in southern Africa, North Africa, and India. An outbreak of pellagra occurred in Malawi among Mozambican refugees between July and October 1989. Eleven camps reported a total of 1,169 patients; 20% of the patients were children less than 5 years of age (40). The French agency Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) instituted active surveillance at the time. Another outbreak occurred between February and October 1990 with 17,878 cases reported among 285,942 refugees in the same 11 sites (attack rate of 6.3%). More than 18,000 cases of deficiency were reported from all districts hosting approximately 900,000 refugees in southern Malawi, for an overall attack rate of 2.0% (35). Food rations contained an average of 4.9 mg of available niacin/person/day; the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)/WHO recommendations for daily niacin intake range from 5.4 mg for infants to 20.3 mg for adults. This outbreak occurred when relief efforts failed to include an adequate supply of groundnuts (peanuts), the major source of niacin in refugee rations. The lack of variety in basic relief rations is a major risk factor for pellagra and other micronutrient deficiency syndromes. Treatment of maize flour with lime (which converts niacin to a biologically available form of niacin) and the inclusion of beans, groundnuts, or fortified cereals in daily rations increase the total intake of available niacin and will prevent the development of pellagra (35).\n【46】 # Anemia\n【47】 The high prevalence of anemia in refugee and displaced populations has been noted in few publications to date, but unpublished data from CDC assessments suggest that it may be a serious problem in some areas. In 1990, a survey of Palestinian refugees in Syria, Jordan, and the West Bank revealed that the prevalence of anemia among infants and young children was between 50% and 70%. Anemia among both nonpregnant and pregnant women was shown to be 25%-50%, whereas a low anemia prevalence rate was found among the male population. (In this study anemia was defined as a hemoglobin concentration of less than 11 g/dL among children and less than 12 g/dL among nonpregnant women. Pregnant women were considered to be anemic if their hemoglobin concentration was less than 11.5 g/dL during either the first or third trimester, or less than 11.0 g/dL during the second trimester.) These findings suggest that iron deficiency, which preferentially affects women and children, was the primary cause of anemia in this population.\n【48】 A 1987 study among refugees in Somalia demonstrated an anemia prevalence rate of 44%-71% among pregnant women, with that proportion being even greater if only women in the third trimester of pregnancy were considered. The cutoff point for hemoglobin concentration in this study was 10 g/dL; with the WHO cutoff of 11 g/dL, the prevalence would have been greater. Among children 9-36 months of age, 59%-90% were below the 10 g/dL cutoff. The inadequacy of the general ration was identified as the major factor causing iron deficiency anemia in this population. In a 1990 study, the prevalence rate of anemia was 13% among children less than 5 years of age in an Ethiopian camp for Somali refugees (Save the Children Fund UK, unpublished data). In addition to dietary iron deficiency, the high incidence of malaria in many refugee populations probably contributes to the high prevalence of anemia in children. This high prevalence of anemia found in some refugee populations may not be significantly greater than that found in local, non-refugee populations, since the latter group has been poorly documented. Nevertheless, anemia may be an additional important preventable risk factor for high mortality in refugee populations. The high prevalence of anemia is often correlated with a subset of the population with severe anemia (hemoglobin (Hb) less than 5 g). Severe anemia in itself can be a major cause of mortality for young children and pregnant women during the peripartum period.\n【49】 # Other micronutrient deficiencies\n【50】 Beriberi (thiamine deficiency) has been reported from several refugee populations that subsist on rice-based food rations (Thailand, 1980;Guinea, 1990). Data regarding iodine deficiency in displaced populations are difficult to find, anecdotal evidence suggests that iodine deficiency, as evidenced by the presence of goiter, has been a problem in at least some camps in Pakistan and Ethiopia (CDC. Toole M, trip report, 1991).\n【51】 # Communicable Diseases\n【52】 Measles, diarrheal diseases, ARIs, and in some cases, malaria are the primary causes of morbidity and mortality among refugee and displaced populations (1,16,41). Figures 4-6 illustrate patterns of mortality typical among those found in refugee camps. Other communicable diseases, i.e., meningococcal meningitis, hepatitis, typhoid fever, and relapsing fever have also been observed among refugee populations; however, the contribution of these illnesses to the overall burden of disease among refugees has been relatively small.\n【53】 Densely populated camps with poor sanitation, inadequate clean water supplies, and lowquality housing all contribute to the rapid spread of disease in refugee settings. In addition, the interaction between malnutrition and infection in these populations, particularly among young children, has contributed to the high rates of morbidity and mortality from communicable diseases. Available and affordable technology could prevent much of this morbidity and mortality either through primary prevention (e.g., immunization, adequate planning, and sanitation) or through appropriate case management (e.g., treatment of dehydration caused by diarrhea with oral rehydration salts and continued feeding).\n【54】 # Measles\n【55】 Outbreaks of measles within refugee camps have been common and have caused many deaths. Low levels of immunization coverage, coupled with high rates of undernutrition and vitamin A deficiency, have played a critical role in the spread of measles and the subsequent mortality within some refugee camps. Measles has been one of the leading causes of death among children in refugee camps. In addition, measles has contributed to high malnutrition rates among those who have survived the initial illness. Measles infection may lead to or exacerbate vitamin A deficiency, compromising immunity and leaving the patient susceptible to xerophthalmia, blindness, and premature death (42). In early 1985, the crude, measlesspecific death rate in one eastern Sudan camp reached 13/1,000/month; among children less than 5 years of age, the measles-specific death rate was 30/1,000/month. Over 2,000 measles deaths were reported in this camp from February through May 1985. Figure 9 illustrates the proportion of all deaths that were due to measles in this camp during the course of the outbreak (16). The CFR was reported to be 33% during this outbreak; however, mild cases may have been underreported. Large numbers of measles deaths have been reported in camps in Somalia, Bangladesh, Sudan, and Ethiopia (1). Mass immunization campaigns were effective in reducing the measles morbidity and mortality rates in camps in both Somalia and Thailand (16). Measles outbreaks probably did not occur during certain other major refugee emergencies (e.g., Somalis in Ethiopia in 1989; Iraqis in Turkey in 1991), because immunization coverage rates were already high in those refugee populations before their flight (9,10).\n【56】 # Diarrheal diseases\n【57】 Diarrheal diseases are a major cause of morbidity and mortality among refugee and displaced populations, primarily because of the inadequacy of the water supply (both in terms of quality and quantity), and the insufficient and poorly maintained sanitation facilities. In eastern Sudan in 1985, between 25%-50% of all deaths in four major camps were attributed to diarrheal diseases. In Somalia (1980), Malawi (1988), and Ethiopia (1989, between 28%-40% of all deaths in refugee camps were attributed to diarrhea (1). Between March and October 1991, 35% of deaths among Somali refugees in the Liboi camp in Kenya were caused by diarrhea. Among Central American refugees in Honduras, diarrheal diseases were responsible for 22.3% of mortality among children less than 5 years of age during a 3-year period (43). In April 1991, in camps for Iraqi refugees on the Turkish border, approximately 70% of all patients arriving at clinics had diarrhea (10). Of these, approximately 25% complained of bloody diarrhea during the first 2 weeks of April. Figure 10 shows the gradual decline in diarrheal disease among clinic outpatients at a Kurdish refugee camp in Turkey.\n【58】 Improvements in camp sanitation and water supply were probably responsible for this trend.\n【59】 Although the etiologies of diarrheal illness during refugee emergencies have not been well documented, the responsible pathogens are most likely to be the same agents that cause diarrhea in non-refugee populations in developing countries. In one study in a camp for famine victims in Ethiopia, of 200 patients with diarrhea, 15.6% had positive cultures for Escherichia coli (pathogenicity not specified by authors), 3.5% for Shigella spp., and 2% for Salmonella spp. (44).\n【60】 # Cholera\n【61】 Outbreaks of cholera have occurred in several refugee populations, although overall, other diarrheal diseases have probably caused many more deaths than cholera. In addition to the morbidity and mortality directly caused by cholera, epidemics of this severe disease cause serious disruption to camp health services. Outbreaks of cholera have been reported in refugee camps in Thailand (16,45), Sudan (46), Ethiopia (11-12), Malawi (47), Somalia (48), and Turkey (10). The Somali Refugee Health Unit reported 6,560 cases of cholera and 1,069 cholera deaths in 1985. During the course of the epidemic, one camp (Gannet) experienced a CFR of 25%. The CFR in the remaining camps was 2.9%, with some areas reporting a CFR of less than 1% (Figure 11) (48). During the same year, two adjacent refugee camps in the Sudan reported a total of 1,175 cases of cholera with 51 deaths (CFR = 4%) over the course of a 2week epidemic (46). Mozambican refugees in Malawi have been especially vulnerable to cholera; 20 separate outbreaks have been reported in Malawian camps since 1988 (49).\n【62】 Outbreak investigations have identified polluted water sources, shared water containers and cooking pots, lack of soap, failure to reheat leftover food, and possibly contaminated food (dried fish) as important risk factors for infection. Nearly 2,000 cases were reported among 80,000 refugees in one camp (Nyamithutu) during a 4-month period in 1990 (Figure 12). Among 26,165 new arrivals during this period, 1,651 cases were reported for an attack rate of 6.3% in this group. The variation in CFRs between camps reflects the different levels of organizational preparedness, health worker training and experience, and available resources. One group of relief workers speculated that high CFRs in some Malawian camps may be associated with concurrent niacin deficiency, although their hypothesis has not yet been proven (Moren A, personal communication).\n【63】 # Acute respiratory infections\n【64】 ARIs are among the leading causes of death among refugee populations. In Thailand (1979), Somalia (1980), Sudan (1985), and Honduras (1984-1987, ARIs were cited among the three main causes of mortality in refugee camps, particularly among children (16,43). Among children less than 5 years of age in refugee camps in Honduras, respiratory infections were responsible for slightly greater than 1 of every 5 deaths during a 3-year period (43).\n【65】 # Tuberculosis (TB)\n【66】 TB is well recognized as a health problem among refugee populations. The crowded living conditions and underlying poor nutritional status of refugee populations may foster the spread of the disease. Although not a leading cause of mortality during the emergency phase, TB often emerges as a critical problem once measles and diarrheal diseases have been adequately controlled. For example, 26% of adult deaths among refugees in Somalia in 1985 were attributed to TB (16). During this time, TB was the third leading cause of death, and the leading cause among adults (48). In eastern Sudan, between 38% and 50% of all deaths in two camps were caused by TB during the 9 to 10 months period after the camps opened (16). TB has been cited as a major health problem among Afghan refugees in Pakistan (CDC. Serdula M, trip report). Although it may be theoretically easier to ensure patient compliance with protracted chemotherapy in the confined space of a refugee camp, the personnel needed to supervise treatment may not be available. In addition, the uncertain duration of stay, frequent changes of camp locations, and poor camp organization may hinder TB treatment programs.\n【67】 # Malaria\n【68】 Malaria is a major health problem in many areas that host large refugee populations, including Somalia, Sudan, Ethiopia, Thailand, Guinea, Cote d'Ivoire, Malawi, Pakistan, and Kenya. Malnutrition and anemia, conditions that are common among refugees, may be directly related to recurrent or persistent malaria infection or may compound the effects of malaria and lead to high mortality. Malaria is the leading cause of morbidity among adult refugees in Malawi and in 1990 caused 18% of all deaths and 25% of deaths among children less than 5 years of age (CDC, unpublished data). Malaria is of particular concern when the displaced population has traveled through, or into, an area of higher endemicity than its region of origin (1). During the period 1979-1980, Khmer refugees traveled from the central valley of Kampuchea, where malaria transmission is very low, into Thailand. Those refugees who arrived at the Sakaeo camp traveled through mountain regions where malaria is highly endemic year round, while refugees who arrived at Khao I-Dang camp had traveled a route that remained within the areas of low malaria transmission. As a result of the differences in exposure during transit, the initial malaria prevalence rate at Sakaeo was 39% compared with a 4% prevalence rate at Khao I-Dang. During this time, malaria was a major cause of death at Sakaeo (50). Similarly, Ethiopian refugees from the highland areas of Tigray province arrived in eastern Sudan in 1985 with decreased immunity against the malaria that is seasonally endemic in that region of Sudan. Not surprisingly, malaria was an important cause of death among these refugees. Farther north, in the Kassala region of eastern Sudan, a major outbreak of malaria occurred among refugees from Eritrea following extensive flooding in the area in September 1988. In contrast to the Tigrayan refugees, the Eritreans were largely from lowland areas and had been previously exposed to malaria. The severity of this outbreak may have been due to the emergence of chloroquine resistant Plasmodium falciparum malaria in eastern Sudan at that time, and the subsequent widespread failure of first-line treatment regimens (Toussie S, personal communication, 1989).\n【69】 Afghan refugees living in the North-West Frontier Province of Pakistan have a higher incidence of clinical malaria than that observed among the local population. A comparison of the epidemiologic trends of malaria between the refugees and the local population over a period of several years demonstrated that the increased rate of malaria illness among refugees was a result of having resettled in an area of higher transmission than that from which they had fled. Because of their limited exposure history, the Afghan refugees had lower levels of immunity to malaria illness than did the local population (51). Few deaths associated with malaria have been reported in this population because the majority of cases have been associated with Plasmodium vivax, a milder form of malaria than that caused by Plasmodium falciparum, the form that is more commonly reported in African camps.\n【70】 # Hepatitis\n【71】 Hepatitis has not been among the most common diseases reported in refugee and displaced populations worldwide, however, since 1985 it has emerged as a serious problem in camps at the Horn of Africa, where access to adequate supplies of clean water has been severely limited. In Somalia during the period 1985-1986, an outbreak of greater than 2,000 cases occurred in two refugee camps, with an overall attack rate of 8% among adults. Of 87 hepatitis deaths, 46% were among pregnant women. The overall CFR was 4%, the CFR in second-and third-trimester pregnant women was 17%. By a process of exclusion, the outbreak was attributed to enterically transmitted non-A, non-B hepatitis (now known as hepatitis E) (52). Figure 13 depicts an outbreak of hepatitis that occurred in the Hartisheik refugee camp in Ethiopia between 1989 and 1990.\n【72】 During an 18-month period, greater than 6,000 cases were reported. Between March and October of 1991, a major outbreak of hepatitis occurred among Somali refugees living in Kenya's Liboi camp; a total of 1,700 cases were reported, yielding an attack rate of 6.3%. The overall CFR was 3.7% and in pregnant women the CFR was 14%. Hepatitis was responsible for one of every five deaths in the camp during that time period. The hepatitis E virus was identified in stool and serum specimens from ill patients. The Ethiopian and Kenyan outbreaks were associated with inadequate water supply. In both camps, refugees had access to an average of only 1-3 liters of clean water/person/day (the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) recommends a minimum of 15 liters/person/day) (53).\n【73】 # Meningitis\n【74】 Overcrowding and limited access to medical care are contributing factors in outbreaks of meningococcal meningitis among refugee populations. Also, many large refugee populations are found in what is termed the \"meningitis belt\" of sub-Saharan Africa. Although children less than 5 years of age are at greatest risk for meningitis, meningococcal meningitis also occurs among older children and adults, particularly in densely populated settings i.e., refugee camps (54). During an outbreak of group A meningococcal disease at the Sakaeo refugee camp in Thailand in 1980, children less than 5 years of age experienced a CFR of 50%. The overall CFR during that outbreak was just over 28% (55). Outbreaks of meningococcal meningitis have also been reported among Ethiopian refugees in eastern Sudan (1985) and among displaced Sudanese in Khartoum and southern Sudan during 1988 (56).\n【75】 # Other Health Issues\n【76】 Although these reports focus on the major causes of morbidity and mortality during the emergency phase of refugee displacements, other health problems warrant the attention of public health practitioners in these settings.\n【77】 # Injuries\n【78】 Thus far, injuries related to armed conflict and psychological problems relating to war, persecution, and the flight of the refugee have been poorly quantified. In a recent report on Iraqi refugees on the Turkish border, 8% of the deaths during a 2-month period were attributed to trauma. Sixty percent of these trauma-related deaths were attributable to shootings by armed soldiers (CDC. Toole M, trip report, September 1991). Anecdotal reports support the existence of high rates of physical disabilities caused by war injuries in some refugee camps, such as those for Afghan refugees in Pakistan, Cambodian refugees in Thailand, and Mozambican refugees in Malawi.\n【79】 # Maternal health\n【80】 The problem of morbidity and mortality related to pregnancy and childbirth has been inadequately documented, although earlier sections of this report described high anemia rates and high hepatitis-specific mortality rates among pregnant women (52). Also, studies of scurvy and pellagra among refugees in Africa have consistently revealed higher incidence rates in women than in men, and a study in Somalia showed that pregnancy was a risk factor for the development of clinical scurvy (32,35).\n【81】 # Sexually transmitted diseases and HIV\n【82】 Few published reports have referred to sexually transmitted diseases (STD) in refugee populations. However, there is no evidence that the incidence of STDs in camps is any higher (or lower) than in non-refugee communities. Similarly, practically no data exist on the prevalence of HIV infection, nor on rates of transmission in these populations. Many of the large displaced and refugee populations of the world are either located in, or have fled to, countries where HIV prevalence rates are high.  Malawi, 1998. MMWR 198938:455-6,461-3. 19.

MMWR 199140:\n【83】 # RECOMMENDATIONS\n【84】 The technical recommendations in this report focus on the public health elements of an appropriate response program for refugees and displaced persons, however, the effectiveness of relief efforts will be enhanced if the affected communities and host countries have prepared for the emergency. Preparedness for sudden population displacement is critical and should be targeted at the most important public health problems identified in previous emergencies: malnutrition, measles, diarrheal diseases, malaria, ARI, and other communicable diseases (e.g., meningitis and hepatitis) that result in high death rates. Preparedness requires that planning for emergencies be included as an integral part of routine health development programs in countries where sudden population displacements might occur. These programs include:\n【85】 - Health Information Systems (HIS).\n【86】 - Diarrheal Disease Control Programs.\n【87】 - Expanded Programs on Immunization (EPI).\n【88】 - Control Programs for Endemic Communicable Diseases.\n【89】 - Nutrition Programs.\n【90】 - Continuing Education Programs for Health Workers.\n【91】 National public health programs should include detailed contingency planning for sudden population movements, both internally and from neighboring countries.\n【92】 # Response Preparedness\n【93】 The critical components of a relief program responding to sudden population displacement comprise the provision of adequate food, clean water, sanitation, and shelter. In addition, the following elements of a health program should be established as soon as possible. The detailed recommendations that follow are organized according to either disease group (e.g., diarrheal diseases or malnutrition) or technical methods (e.g., rapid assessment). Nevertheless, it is critical to keep in mind the demographic groups that are most at risk during emergencies, namely young children and women. It is important that health services in refugee settings be organized in a way that facilitates access by these groups. In general, MCH services should be given higher priority than general outpatient dispensaries and hospitals.\n【94】 # Maternal and Child Health Care\n【95】 MCH clinics should be established (ideally one MCH clinic per 5,000 population) and staffed by trained personnel to provide routine screening and preventive, and curative services to pregnant and lactating women and to children less than 2 years of age. If resources are adequate, these services should be extended to children between 2 and 5 years of age. Services for children should include routine growth monitoring, immunization, nutritional rehabilitation, vitamin A supplementation, and curative care, as well as health education for their mothers.\n【96】 Female health workers should be trained and employed to provide culturally appropriate health education both at MCH clinics and within the community, and to refer pregnant women to the clinic for antenatal care. At least some of these health workers should be recruited from among traditional birth attendants in the community. Antenatal care should include screening for high-risk pregnancies and providing iron and folic acid supplementation (as well as iodine supplementation in areas of endemic goiter), tetanus toxoid immunization, and health education. Postnatal care should include nutritional supplementation, counselling on family spacing, provision of contraceptives, and education about breastfeeding and infant care. In certain cultural situations, curative care may need to be provided to all women of child-bearing age in a setting physically segregated from male outpatient facilities.\n【97】 # Program-Specific Recommendations\n【98】 The following content areas are covered in these recommendations:\n【99】 - Rapid Health Assessment - Health Information Systems - Nutrition - Control of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases - Control of Diarrheal Diseases - Malaria Control - Tuberculosis Control - Epidemic Investigations\n【100】 # Rapid Health Assessment\n【101】 Rapid health assessment of an acute population displacement is conducted to:\n【102】 - Assess the magnitude of the displacement.\n【103】 - Determine the major health and nutrition needs of the displaced population.\n【104】 - Initiate a health and nutrition surveillance system.\n【105】 - Assess the local response capacity and immediate needs.\n【106】 # Preparations\n【107】 The amount of time required to conduct an initial assessment of a refugee influx depends on the remoteness of the location, availability of transport, security situation in the area, availability of appropriate specialists, and willingness of the host country government to involve external agencies in refugee relief programs. In small countries with functioning communications facilities and secure borders, the assessment might be conducted in 4 days; in other countries, it might take 2 weeks.\n【108】 Before the field visit, relevant information relating to the status of the incoming refugees, as well as the available resources of the host community, should be obtained from local ministries or organizations based in the capital city. Any maps of the area where the refugees are arriving and settling should likewise be obtained. Aerial photographs will also be of value, but may be considered sensitive by the military of the host country. International organizations like UNICEF, WHO, and the Red Cross/Red Crescent may also have demographic and health data concerning the refugee population.\n【109】 In preparation for the field visit, establish whether food, medical supplies (including vaccines), or other relief supplies have been ordered or procured by any of the relief agencies involved. Additionally, the following conditions should be included in a field assessment.\n【110】 # Field assessment\n【111】 The following demographic information is required to determine the health status of the population.\n【112】 - Total refugee or displaced population - Age-sex breakdown - Identification of at-risk groups; e.g., children less than 5 years of age, pregnant and lactating women, disabled and wounded persons, and unaccompanied minors - Average family or household size Why this information is needed. The total population will be used as the denominator for all birth, death, injury, morbidity, and malnutrition rates to be estimated later. The total population is necessary for the calculation of quantities of relief supplies. The breakdown of the population by age and sex allows for the calculation of age-and sex-specific rates and enables interventions to be targeted effectively (e.g., immunization campaigns).\n【113】 # Sources of information.\n【114】 Local government officials or camp authorities may be able to provide registration records. If no registration system is in effect, one should be established immediately. Information recorded should include the names of household heads, the number of family members by age and sex, former village and region of residence, and ethnic group, if applicable.\n【115】 Refugee leaders may also have records, particularly if entire villages have fled together. In certain situations, political groups may have organized the exodus and may have detailed lists of refugee families.\n【116】 A visual inspection of the settlement may provide a general impression of the demographic composition of the population. However, information obtained in this manner should be used judiciously as it is likely to provide a distorted view of the situation.\n【117】 It may be necessary to conduct a limited survey on a convenience sample in order to obtain demographic information. Beginning at a randomly selected point, survey a sample (e.g., 50) of dwellings. Visit every fifth or 10th house until the predetermined number of houses have been surveyed. At each house, record the number of family members, the age and sex of each person, and the number of pregnant or lactating women. This process will establish an initial estimate of the demographic composition of the population. Estimate the number of persons in each house, as well as the total number of houses in the settlement, to gain a provisional estimate of the camp population. At the very least, this quick survey should give a rough estimate of the proportion of the total population made up of \"vulnerable\" groups; i.e., children less than 5 years of age and women of child bearing age. To determine the total population, a census may need to be conducted later.\n【118】 # Background health information\n【119】 The information required includes:\n【120】 - Main health problems in country of origin.\n【121】 - Previous sources of health care (e.g., traditional healers).\n【122】 - Important health beliefs and traditions (e.g., food taboos during pregnancy).\n【123】 - Social structure (e.g., whether the refugees are grouped in their traditional villages and what type of social or political organization exists). - Strength and coverage of public health programs in country of origin (e.g., immunization).\n【124】 Why this information is needed. Effective planning of health services will depend on this information. Planners need to be aware of traditional beliefs, taboos, and practices in order to avoid making costly mistakes and alienating the population.\n【125】 # Sources of information.\n【126】 Obtain documents and reports from the host government, international organizations, and nongovernment organizations pertaining to endemic diseases and public health programs in the displaced population's region of origin.\n【127】 Interview refugee leaders, heads of households, women leaders (e.g., traditional midwives), and health workers among the refugee population.\n【128】 Seek information from development agencies, private companies, missionaries, or other groups having experience with the displaced population.\n【129】 # Nutritional status\n【130】 The information required includes:\n【131】 - Prevalence of protein-energy undernutrition in the population less than 5 years of age.\n【132】 - Nutritional status before arrival in host country.\n【133】 - Prevalence of micronutrient deficiencies in the population less than 5 years of age.\n【134】 Why this information is needed. Evidence exists to support the fact that the nutritional status of displaced populations is closely linked with their chances of survival. Initial assessment of nutritional status serves to establish the degree of urgency in delivering food rations, the need for immediate supplementary feeding programs (SFPs), and the presence of micronutrient deficiencies that require urgent attention.\n【135】 # Sources of nutritional information\n【136】 If refugees are still arriving at the site:\n【137】 - Initiate nutritional screening of new arrivals immediately.\n【138】 - Measure all children (or every third or fourth child, if insufficient trained personnel are available or the refugee influx is too great) for mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) or, if time and personnel permit, WFH. Estimate the proportion of undernourished children using the methods described in the Rapid Nutrition Assessment Manual. - - Look for clinical signs of severe anemia and vitamin A, B, and C deficiencies.\n【139】 - If refugees are continuing to arrive, set up a permanent screening program for new arrivals. A screening program also can be used to administer measles vaccination and vitamin A supplements to new arrivals.\n【140】 If refugees are already located in a settlement:\n【141】 - Walk through the settlement, select houses randomly, and observe the nutritional status of the children less than 5 years of age. Visual assessment should only be done by persons who are experienced in the assessment of malnutrition. The observer should enter the homes as malnourished children are likely to be bedridden. - Combine the visual inspection with a rapid assessment of nutritional status, using either MUAC or WFH measurements. This can be done during the demographic survey described above. (See \"Rapid Health Assessment\") - Review the records of local hospitals treating members of the displaced population.\n【142】 Note admissions or consultations for undernutrition and deaths related to undernutrition. - Interview refugee leaders to establish food availability before displacement and the duration of the journey from place of origin to their present location.\n【143】 In order to gather baseline data for evaluation of nutrition programs, plan to conduct a valid, cluster sample survey of the population as soon as possible (within 2 weeks). Appropriate technical expertise will be needed for the implementation and analysis of the survey.\n【144】 # Mortality rates\n【145】 The information required includes crude, age-, sex-, and cause-specific mortality rates. Why this information is needed. In the initial stages of a population displacement, mortality rates, expressed as deaths/10,000/day, are a critical indicator of improving or deteriorating health status.\n【146】 In many African countries, the daily CMR (extrapolated from published annual rates) is approximately 0.5/10,000/day during non-emergency conditions. In general, health workers should be extremely concerned when CMRs in a displaced population exceed 1/10,000/day, or when less than 5 years of age mortality rates exceed 4/10,000/day.\n【147】 Sources of mortality information. Check local hospital records and the records of local burial contractors. Interview community leaders.\n【148】 Establish a mortality surveillance system. One approach is to designate a single burial site for the camp, which should be monitored by 24-hour grave watchers. Grave watchers should be trained to interview families, using a standard questionnaire, and then to record the data to determine gender, approximate age, and probable cause of death.\n【149】 Other methods of collecting mortality data include registering deaths, issuing burial shrouds to families of the deceased to ensure compliance, or employing volunteer community informants who report deaths for a defined section of the population.\n【150】 Demographic data are absolutely essential for calculating mortality rates. These provide the denominator for estimating death rates in the entire population and within specific vulnerable groups, such as children less than 5 years of age.\n【151】 The population needs to be assured that death registration will have no adverse consequences (e.g., ration reductions).\n【152】 # Morbidity\n【153】 The information required includes age-and sex-specific data regarding the incidence of common diseases of public health importance, i.e., measles, malaria, diarrheal diseases, and ARI, as well as diseases of epidemic potential such as hepatitis and meningitis. The data should be collected by all health facilities, including feeding centers.\n【154】 Why this information is needed. Data on diseases of public health importance may help plan an effective preventive and curative health program for refugees. These data will also facilitate the procurement of appropriate medical supplies and the recruitment and training of appropriate medical personnel, as well as focus environmental sanitation efforts (e.g., toward mosquito control in areas of high malaria prevalence).\n【155】 Sources of morbidity information. Review the records of local clinics and hospitals to which refugees have access.\n【156】 Where a clinic, hospital, or feeding center has already been established within the camp, examine patient records or registers and tally common causes of morbidity. Interview refugee leaders and health workers within the refugee population.\n【157】 A simple morbidity surveillance system should be established as soon as curative services are established in the camp. Feeding centers should be included in the surveillance system. Community health workers should be trained as soon as possible to report diseases at the community level.\n【158】 The initiation of certain public health actions should not be delayed until the disease appears.\n【159】 For example, measles immunization should be implemented immediately. Do not wait for the appearance of measles in the camp. Also, oral rehydration centers should be routinely established in all situations.\n【160】 # Environmental conditions\n【161】 The information required includes:\n【162】 - Climatic conditions (average temperatures and rainfall patterns).\n【163】 - Geographic features (soil, slope, and drainage).\n【164】 - Water sources (local wells, reservoirs, rivers, tanks).\n【165】 - Local disease epidemiology (endemic infectious diseases, e.g., malaria, schistosomiasis). - Local disease vectors (mosquitoes, flies, ticks), including breeding sites.\n【166】 - Availability of local materials for shelter and fuel.\n【167】 - Existing shelters.\n【168】 # Existing sanitation arrangements (latrines and open areas).\n【169】 Why this information is needed. Information on local environmental conditions affecting the health of displaced populations will help relief planners create priorities for public health programs.\n【170】 # Sources of information.\n【171】 This assessment is made largely by visual inspection. In addition, interviews with local government and technical specialists will yield important information. In some cases, special surveys need to be conducted; e.g., entomologists may need to survey for local disease vectors, and water engineers may need to assess water sources.\n【172】 # Resources available Food supplies\n【173】 Efforts to evaluate food supplies should include:\n【174】 - Attempting to assess the quantity and type of food currently available to the population. - Calculating the average per capita caloric intake over the period of time for which records are available, if food is already being officially distributed. - Inspecting any local markets for food availability and prices.\n【175】 - Conducting a quick survey of dwellings and estimating the average food stores in each household. This should be done during the demographic survey (see \"Rapid Health Assessment\"). Look for obvious inequities between different families or different ethnic or regional groups.\n【176】 Food sources. Local, regional, and national markets need to be assessed. The cash and material resources of the displaced population should also be assessed in order to estimate its local purchasing power.\n【177】 Food logistics . Assess transport and fuel availability, storage facilities (size, security), and seasonal conditions of access roads.\n【178】 Feeding programs. Follow these guidelines to evaluate feeding programs:\n【179】 - Look for any established feeding programs (mass, supplementary, and therapeutic feedings). These may have been set up by local officials, PVOs, church groups, or local villagers. - Assess enrollment and discharge criteria, enrollment and attendance figures, quantity and quality of food being provided, availability of water, managerial competence, utensils, and storage. - Determine whether measles vaccine is being administered.\n【180】 Local health services. Follow these guidelines for assessing the capabilities of health services:\n【181】 - Determine the ease of access by refugees (official attitudes, location, hours of operation). - Evaluate the condition and size of facilities.\n【182】 - Note the extent and appropriateness of medicines, equipment, and services.\n【183】 - Determine the type and number of personnel.\n【184】 - Review cold storage facilities, vaccine supplies, logistics, and communication systems. Camp health services. Follow these guidelines for assessing camp health services: - Note the type of facility (clinic, hospital, feeding center), as well as the size, capacity, and structure (tent, local materials). - Determine the adequacy of health-facility water supply.\n【185】 - Assess refrigeration facilities, fuel, and generator.\n【186】 - Assess supplies of essential drugs (whether generic or brandname) and medical supplies. - Determine the need for essential vaccines and immunization equipment.\n【187】 - Note the type of health personnel (doctors, nurses, nutritionists, sanitarians) and their relevant experience and skills. - Review storage facilities.\n【188】 - Assess adequacy of transport, fuel, and communications.\n【189】 - Locate health workers in refugee population (traditional healers, birth attendants, \"modern\" practitioners). - Determine whether there is a need for interpreters.\n【190】 # Taking action\n【191】 - An itemized summary of the findings should be prepared, following the sequence of activities outlined in this document. - Estimate and quantify the need for outside assistance, based on preliminary findings.\n【192】 - Prepare and convey assessment findings to appropriate emergency health officials at the local, national, and international levels.\n【193】 Checklist For Rapid Health Assessment - Preparation - Obtain available information regarding refugees and resources from host country ministries and organizations. - Obtain available maps or aerial photographs.\n【194】 - Obtain demographic and health data from international organizations.\n【195】 # Field assessment\n【196】 - Determine total displaced population.\n【197】 - Determine age and sex breakdown of population.\n【198】 - Identify groups at increased risk.\n【199】 - Determine average household size.\n【200】 # Health information\n【201】 - Identify primary health problems in country of origin.\n【202】 - Identify previous sources of health care.\n【203】 - Ascertain important health beliefs and traditions.\n【204】 - Determine the existing social structure.\n【205】 - Determine the strength and coverage of public health programs in country of origin.\n【206】 # Nutritional status\n【207】 - Determine prevalence of PEM in population less than 5 years of age.\n【208】 - Ascertain prior nutritional status.\n【209】 - Determine prevalence of micronutrient deficiencies in the population less than 5 years of age.\n【210】 # Mortality rates\n【211】 - Calculate crude, age-, sex-, and cause-specific mortality rates.\n【212】 # Morbidity\n【213】 - Determine age-and sex-specific incidence rates of diseases that have public health importance.\n【214】 # Environmental conditions\n【215】 - Determine climatic conditions.\n【216】 - Identify geographic features.\n【217】 - Identify water sources.\n【218】 - Ascertain local disease epidemiology.\n【219】 - Identify local disease vectors.\n【220】 - Assess availability of local materials for shelter and fuel.\n【221】 - Assess existing shelters and sanitation arrangements.\n【222】 # Resources available\n【223】 - Assess food supplies and distribution systems.\n【224】 - Identify and assess local, regional, and national food sources.\n【225】 - Assess the logistics of food transport and storage.\n【226】 - Assess feeding programs.\n【227】 - Identify and assess local health services.\n【228】 - Assess camp health services.\n【229】 # Health Information System\n【230】 A health information system (HIS) provides continuous information on the health status of the refugee community and comprises both ongoing routine surveillance and intermittent population-based sample surveys. This information may be used to:\n【231】 - Follow trends in the health status of the community and establish health-care priorities. - Detect and respond to epidemics.\n【232】 - Evaluate program effectiveness and service coverage.\n【233】 - Ensure that resources are targeted to the areas of greatest need.\n【234】 - Evaluate the quality of care delivered.\n【235】 # Data collection\n【236】 As soon as health services are established for a refugee population, a surveillance system should be instituted and should ideally be set up at the time of an initial, rapid assessment. Any agency or facility (including feeding centers) providing health services to the refugee population should be part of the reporting network. Any host community services to which the refugees might have access should also be part of the system.\n【237】 Health information should be reported on a simple, standardized surveillance form. (A sample form, adapted from WHO Emergency Relief Operations, is located at the end of this section.) Each health facility should be held accountable for completing the reporting form at the appropriate interval and for returning it to the person or agency charged with compiling the reports, analyzing the information, and providing feedback. Each refugee settlement or camp should have a person responsible for coordinating the HIS. Forms should be translated into the appropriate local language(s) if community health workers are involved in information collection.\n【238】 Health facilities should keep a daily record of patients; age, sex, clinical and laboratory diagnosis, and treatment should be specified. If personnel time is limited, a simple tally sheet should be used. In addition, the patient should be issued a health record card on which the date, diagnosis, and treatment are recorded. Each time a patient contacts the health-care system, whether for curative or preventive services, this should be noted on the health record card. Laboratory data should accompany diagnostic information whenever possible. Collecting Processing, Storing, and Shipping Diagnostic Specimens in Refugee Health-Care Environments - provides an overview of procedures for collecting and processing diagnostic specimens in the field.\n【239】 Data collection should be limited to that information that can and will be acted upon. Information that is not immediately useful should not be collected during the emergency phase of a refugee relief operation. Overly detailed or complex reporting requirements will result in noncompliance.\n【240】 The most valuable data are generally simple to collect and to analyze. Standard case definitions for the most common causes of morbidity and mortality should be developed and put in writing. The data collected will fall into one of the following categories: a) demographic, b) mortality, c) morbidity, d) nutritional status, and e) health program activities.\n【241】 Population. Camp registration records should provide most of the demographic information needed. If registration records are inadequate, a population census may be necessary. Conducting a census is often politically sensitive and may be delayed by the administrative authorities for a long period of time. Consequently, innovative methods may need to be devised. For example, organize a nutritional screening of all children less than 5 years of age. Count the children and estimate the percentage of the total population less than 5 years of age by doing a sample survey. From this information, estimate the total population size. For other methods to determine population size and structure see \"Rapid Health Assessment\".\n【242】 It is important that population figures be updated on a regular basis, taking into account new arrivals, departures, births, and deaths. The total population is used as the denominator in the calculation of disease incidence, birth, and death rates. This total is also necessary to determine requirements for food and medical supplies and to estimate program coverage rates. Information about the population structure is needed to calculate age-and sex-specific morbidity and mortality rates, to estimate ration requirements, and to determine the target population for specific interventions, i.e., antenatal care and immunizations.\n【243】 The rate of new arrivals and departures gives an indication of the stability of the population and will influence policy decisions about long-term interventions, such as TB therapy. This information is also used to predict future resource and program needs.\n【244】 A birth registration system is usually simple, since the community expects an increase in the family food ration as a result of a new birth. Births might be reported in the community to volunteer health workers or traditional birth attendants. Alternatively, if good antenatal care services are established, follow-up of pregnant mothers will allow for a relatively complete registration of births. Examples of mortality surveillance systems are described in \"Rapid Health Assessment\". Deaths may be underreported if there is a fear of possible ration reduction; thus, an agreement might be negotiated with camp authorities not to decrease rations after a death occurs --at least during the emergency phase. Arrivals and departures should be monitored through the camp registration system.\n【245】 Mortality. Each health facility should keep a log of all patient deaths (with cause of death and relevant demographic information) and report the deaths on a standardized form. Because many deaths occur outside of the health-care system, a community-based mortality surveillance system should be established. Such a system may include the employment of grave watchers, the routine issuance of burial shrouds, and the use of community informants (see \"Rapid Health Assessment\").\n【246】 Death rates are the most specific indicators of a population's health status and are the category of data to which donors and relief agencies most readily respond. During the emergency phase of a relief operation, death rates should be expressed as deaths/10,000/day to allow for detection of sudden changes. In refugee camps, relief programs should aim at achieving a CMR of less than 1/10,000/day as soon as possible. This rate still represents approximately twice the \"normal\" CMR for non-displaced populations in most developing nations and should not signal a relaxation of efforts. After the emergency phase, death rates should be expressed as deaths/1,000/month to reflect the usual reporting frequency and to facilitate comparison with baseline, non-refugee death rates.\n【247】 Age-and sex-specific mortality rates will indicate the need for interventions targeted at specific vulnerable groups. During the early stage of a relief operation, specific death rates for persons less than 5 years of age and greater than 5 years of age may suffice. Later, further disaggregation by age may be feasible --for example, less than 1 year, 1-4 years, 5-14 years, and greater than 15 years. Different male-and female-specific death rates may reflect inequitable access to resources or health services. Cause-specific mortality rates will reflect those health problems having the greatest impact on the refugee community and requiring the highest priority in public health program planning. Morbidity. Health facilities and feeding centers should report morbidity information on the same form on which mortality is reported. Each disease reported in the system must have a written case definition that will guide health workers in their diagnosis and ensure the validity of data. Where practical, case definitions that rely on clinical signs and symptoms should be tested periodically for sensitivity and specificity as compared with a laboratory standard (e.g., malaria).\n【248】 Knowledge of the major causes of illness and the groups in the affected population that are at greatest risk allows for the efficient planning of intervention strategies and the most effective use of resources. Morbidity rates are more useful than a simple tallying of cases, as trends can be followed over time, or rates compared with those from different populations. The monitoring of proportional morbidity (e.g., percentage of all morbidity caused by specific diseases) may be useful when specific control measures are being evaluated, although caution is needed in the interpretation of trends. A relative decrease in disease-specific proportional morbidity may merely reflect an absolute increase in the incidence of another disease.\n【249】 Nutritional status. Data regarding nutritional status can be obtained through a nutritional assessment survey or a mass screening exercise. Surveys should be repeated at regular intervals to determine changes in nutritional status; however, not so frequently as to obscure true differences between surveys. All children less than 5 years of age should undergo a nutritional screening upon arrival at the camp and should continue to be weighed and measured monthly at MCH clinics in the camp. Information collected during these screenings should be included in HIS reports. If the initial screening identifies high prevalence rates of undernutrition, cross-sectional surveys should be repeated at intervals of 6-8 weeks until the undernutrition prevalence rate is below 10%. Thereafter, surveys every 6-12 months will suffice, unless routine surveillance data indicate that nutritional status has deteriorated. Measurement of nutritional status is described in the Rapid Nutrition Assessment Manual. *\n【250】 The prevalence of acute malnutrition acts as an indicator of the adequacy of the relief ration. A high prevalence of malnutrition in the presence of an adequate average daily ration may indicate inequities in the food distribution system, or high incidence rates of communicable diseases (e.g., measles and diarrhea). The presence of nutritional deficiency disorders (i.e., pellagra, anemia, or xerophthalmia) indicates the need for ration supplementation.\n【251】 Programs. Each health facility should keep a log of all activities. Immunizations should be recorded in a central record, as well as on the person's health record card. Records of health sector activities will be useful in determining whether certain groups in the population are underserved, and in planning measures to reach a broader population base. Although approximate immunization coverage may be estimated from the number of vaccine doses administered, the preferred method is by annual population surveys.\n【252】 # Analysis and interpretation\n【253】 Most data can be analyzed locally using a pen and paper. The use of computers and a data entry and analysis program, such as Epi Info, version 5, may be practical at the regional or national level. Trends in mortality, morbidity, and nutritional status should be monitored closely. Careful attention should be paid to changing denominators, and changes in proportional mortality or morbidity should be interpreted with particular caution. Where applicable, correlations between mortality, morbidity or nutritional status, and health sector activities should be examined. Likewise, the proportion of malnourished children identified in population surveys as enrolled in feeding programs can be used to estimate program coverage. All components of the HIS should be analyzed and interpreted in an integrated fashion. A single element examined alone will reveal only a small portion of the entire picture and may be easily misinterpreted. For example, an apparent decrease in malnutrition prevalence should be interpreted in the context of childhood mortality rates (1). The use of health information to guide program decision-making will be facilitated if targets and critical indicators are established at the beginning. For example, a measles incidence rate of 1/1,000/month might be an indicator that would initiate specific preventive actions. Similarly, during a cholera outbreak, a CFR of 3% in a given week might stimulate a critical review of case management procedures.\n【254】 # Control measures\n【255】 The information gathered through the HIS should be used to develop recommendations and to implement specific control measures. Objectives for disease control programs should be established and progress towards these objectives regularly assessed. The presentation of data to decision-makers should make use of simple, clear tables and graphs. Most importantly, there should be regular feedback to the data providers through newsletters, bulletins, and frequent supervisory visits.\n【256】 # Assessment\n【257】 The HIS should be periodically assessed to determine its accuracy, completeness, simplicity, flexibility, and timeliness. The utilization of the data by program planners and key decisionmakers should also be assessed. The HIS should evolve as the need for information changes.\n【258】 # Nutrition Rations\n【259】 For populations totally dependent upon food aid, a general ration of at least 1,900 kcal/person/day is required. At least 10% of the calories in the general ration should be in the form of fats and at least 12% should be derived from proteins.\n【260】 - Each of the rations above provides at least minimum quantities of energy, protein, and fat. - Ration 2 provides additional quantities of various micronutrients through the inclusion of a fortified blended cereal. When provided in the general ration, fortified cereal blends should be used for the whole family.\n【261】 The calculation of rations should account for calorie loss during transport and food preparation. Similarly, when the mean daily temperature falls below 20 C, the caloric requirement should be increased accordingly by 1% per degree of temperature below 20 C.\n【262】 The standard requirement of 1,900 kcals is based on the following demographic structure of a population:\n【263】 - Children less than 5 years of age (20%).\n【264】 - Children 5-14 years of age (35%).\n【265】 - Women 15-44 years of age (20%), of whom 40% are pregnant or lactating.\n【266】 - Males 15-44 years of age (10%).\n【267】 - Adults greater than 44 years of age (15%).\n【268】 The calculation of ration requirements should be adjusted for deviations from the above population structure (age/gender breakdown), the underlying health and nutritional status of the population, and relative activity levels of the community.\n【269】 # Guidelines for ration distribution\n【270】 - Food should be distributed in a community setting. Camps and mass feedings should be avoided if at all possible. - Ration distribution should complement, not replace, any food that the refugees are able to provide for themselves. - Distributed food should be familiar and culturally acceptable to the refugees.\n【271】 - If food is distributed in uncooked form, adequate fuel and cooking utensils should be made available. - Grains should be provided in ground form, or grinders must be made available.\n【272】 - Distribution must be done on a regular basis, with no longer period than 10-14 days between distributions. - If a specified food item in the ration cannot be supplied, the energy and nutrient content of the missing item should be provided by including additional quantities of another available commodity. This type of substitution is appropriate only as a shortterm measure. - Breast-feeding should be encouraged and supported.\n【273】 - Lactating women should be provided with extra sources of calories and protein.\n【274】 Appropriate weaning foods should be included in the general ration (fats and oils). - Bottle feeding should be discouraged. Infant bottles and formula should not be distributed. - Dry skim milk (DSM) and other milk products should not be included in the ration as such, except where milk consumption is part of the traditional diet. Milk products should be mixed with milled grains to form a cereal. Any milk product that is included in the rations should be fortified with vitamin A. - If fresh fruits and vegetables are not available, fortified blended foods (e.g., corn-soya milk (CSM)), CSB, or similar local products) should be provided to meet micronutrient requirements. - Refugees should be encouraged to grow vegetables. Seeds, gardening implements, and suitable land should be made available for kitchen gardens. This is critical for the prevention of pellagra and scurvy. - Refugees should be permitted access to local markets and be allowed to create markets. Trading or selling of ration commodities may be a necessary part of the camp economy. It enables refugees to supplement their diets with foods otherwise unavailable to them and to obtain essential nonfood items. - It may be advisable to include certain culturally significant items i.e., tea, sugar, and spices in the food basket. Where such items are highly valued, refugees will sell or trade part of their ration to obtain them. This results in a reduction of caloric intake. Providing these items eliminates this overall reduction.\n【275】 # Supplementary feeding programs\n【276】 SFPs are designed to help prevent severe malnutrition and to rehabilitate moderately malnourished persons. SFPs are not intended to be used as a method of targeting food during an emergency phase. Similarly, SFPs are inappropriate as a long-term supplement to an inadequate general ration. Implementation of a SFP is necessary under the following circumstances:\n【277】 - When the general ration is less than 1,500 kcal/person.\n【278】 - Where nutritional assessment reveals that greater than 20% of children less than 5 years of age are acutely malnourished, as determined by a Z-score indicator of less than -2. - When the acute malnutrition prevalence (as determined by a Z-score indicator of less than -2) falls between 10%-20% and the general ration is between 1,500-1,900 kcal. - Where there is a high incidence of measles or diarrheal disease.\n【279】 Inclusion and discharge criteria. The following groups should be targeted for inclusion in a SFP:\n【280】 - Acutely undernourished children less than 5 years of age (WFH Z-score less than -2 or less than 80% of reference median). - Pregnant and lactating women.\n【281】 - Elderly, chronically ill (e.g., TB patients), or disadvantaged groups.\n【282】 Children should be discharged from the SFP after they have maintained greater than 85% of median WFH (or a Z-score greater than -1.5) for a period of 1 month.\n【283】 Caloric requirements . A SFP should provide at least 500 kcal and 15 g protein/day in one or two feedings. High energy milk (HEM), a calorie-dense milk mixture, may be used in a SFP. One milliliter of HEM provides 1 kcal of energy. The formula below makes 5 L of HEM: 420 g dried skimmed milk 250 g sugar 320 g oil 4.4 L water If the general ration is inadequate (less than 1,900 kcal/person/day), the supplementary ration should provide 700-1,000 kcal/person/day in two to three feedings.\n【284】 # Types of SFPs\n【285】 . SFPs fall into two categories, either on-site feeding or take-home rations. Listed below are some of the advantages and disadvantages of each type of SFP (1). On-site feeding. \"Wet\" rations are prepared by SFP staff and served to recipients in the feeding center. Listed below are the advantages of wet rations:\n【286】 - The likelihood that the ration will be shared among family members is reduced.\n【287】 - SFP staff maintain control over the preparation and consumption of the supplementary meals. - Additional services can be incorporated into the feeding program.\n【288】 These are the disadvantages of wet rations:\n【289】 - Young children must be accompanied to the center. This may lead to poor attendance rates and create a hardship for many mothers who must also provide for other family members.\n【290】 - Feeding centers must be located near the homes of the recipients.\n【291】 - In order to increase motivation and attendance, other services may need to be offered.\n【292】 - Feeding centers are a drain on health personnel resources.\n【293】 - Feeding center meals may be substituted for meals at home, resulting in a net food intake deficit. - On-site feedings are not appropriate for targeting entire families or community groups. - Children less than 2 years of age are generally underserved by on-site feedings.\n【294】 - On-site feedings remove the family's responsibility and control over providing for family members. - The possibility of cross-contamination and infection is increased in mass feedings. Take-home programs. \"Dry\" rations are provided on a regular basis to supplement the general ration normally received. These are the advantages of dry rations:\n【295】 - Daily attendance of the enrollee or other family members is not required.\n【296】 - Fewer centers are needed, and these may be located at a greater distance from homes.\n【297】 - The supplementary ration increases the purchasing power of the family.\n【298】 - The ration is intended to provide supplementation 365 days/year. (No missed days for holidays) - Dry rations generally achieve higher coverage rates than wet rations.\n【299】 - There is less disruption of family activities, as daily attendance is not required.\n【300】 - The family is able to maintain control over feeding practices.\n【301】 These are the disadvantages of dry rations:\n【302】 - Dry rations are less effective at targeting person beneficiaries.\n【303】 - Sharing of the ration among family members is increased.\n【304】 # Other elements of SFPs\n【305】 - Vitamin A should be administered upon admission to the SFP and every 3 months thereafter.\n【306】 - If vitamin C is not included from the ration, vitamin C supplements should be administered weekly to all persons enrolled in SFPs. - If iron deficiency anemia is highly prevalent, the provision of iron syrup to children enrolled in SFPs should be considered. - All enrollees in the SFP should have their measles immunization status checked upon admission, and vaccine administered if needed. - Mebendazole, an anthelminthic, should be administered along with the vitamin A, if it is available. Each child should be administered two 100 mg tablets to be chewed. Mebendazole should not be administered to infants less than 12 months of age or to pregnant women. - On-site feeding centers require a regular supply of clean water and cooking fuel.\n【307】 # Therapeutic feeding programs\n【308】 Therapeutic feeding programs (TFPs) are considered a medical intervention, the purpose of which is to save lives and restore the nutritional health of severely malnourished children. The recommendations listed below are adapted from the procedures for selective feeding (2).\n【309】 # Enrollment criteria.\n【310】 Children should be enrolled in a TFP if they meet one of the following criteria:\n【311】 - Children less than 5 years of age (or less than 115 cm in height) with WFH Z-score of less than -3 (less than 70% median). - Children with clinically evident edema.\n【312】 - Children referred to TFP by medical personnel.\n【313】 # Caloric requirements\n【314】 - Children enrolled in a TFP should receive 150 kcal and 3 g of protein for each kg body weight/day. - Feeding should be done in four to six meals/day. Feeding centers that provide meals on a 24-hour basis are likely to be most effective. - HEM should be included in the TFP ration.\n【315】 - All children enrolled in the TFP should receive a full course of vitamin A upon admission. - Severely malnourished children typically have poor appetites and may require nasogastric feedings for short intervals. Trained and experienced personnel are needed for this procedure.\n【316】 - As a general practice, all doses of vitamin A should be documented on the child's growth record chart.\n【317】 Full treatment schedule . A full treatment schedule of oral vitamin A should be administered to all persons suffering from severe malnutrition (WFH Z-score less than -3) or exhibiting eye symptoms of vitamin A deficiency (xerosis, Bitot's spots, keratomalacia, or corneal ulceration). The dose schedule is given below: 200,000 IU on day 1 200,000 IU on day 2 200,000 IU 1 to 4 weeks later.\n【318】 Children less than 12 months of age receive half doses.\n【319】 Anemia. The prevalence of anemia can be determined through a rapid anemia survey using a portable Hb photometer (HemoCue system).\n【320】 The CDC has established the following criteria for defining anemia:\n【321】 - Children 15 years of age: Hb less than 11.0 g/dL - Pregnant women: Hb less than 11.0 g/dL - Nonpregnant women: Hb less than 12 g/dL - Men: Hb less than 13.5 g/dL\n【322】 The risk of anemia is highest in pregnant and lactating women, and in children ages 9-36 months. If the general ration contains inadequate amounts of absorbable iron, folate, and vitamin C, anemia may be prevented through the daily administration of iron/folate tablets and vitamin C supplements. Supplementary feeding of high-risk groups with CSM will also help to reduce the likelihood of anemia (CSM contains 18 g iron/100 g).\n【323】 Iron/folic acid. Routine iron/folate supplements should be provided to all pregnant and lactating women through antenatal and postnatal clinics. Female health workers should be employed to seek out pregnant and lactating women and encourage their participation in these programs.\n【324】 Vitamin C. Fortification of foods with vitamin C is problematic because vitamin C is unstable. Further study is needed on the appropriate vehicle for fortification. The best solution is to provide a variety of fresh foods either by including them in the general ration or by promoting access to local markets. In addition, local cultivation of vitamin C-containing foods should be encouraged. Patients with clinical scurvy should be treated with 250 mg of oral vitamin C two times daily for 3 weeks.\n【325】 Niacin. Maize-eating populations are at greatest risk for niacin deficiency, which causes pellagra. Recent studies of pellagra outbreaks among refugee populations found groundnut consumption, garden ownership, and home maize milling (as an indicator of higher socioeconomic status) to be protective factors. Niacin-fortified flour should be included in the general ration. The process of fortifying maize flour with niacin is simple and relatively inexpensive.\n【326】 Clinical cases of pellagra can be treated with nicotinamide. The recommended treatment schedule is 100 mg three times daily for 3 weeks. The total daily dose of nicotinamide should not exceed 600 mg. Where the diet is deficient in niacin, vitamin B complex tablets can be used to prevent pellagra.\n【327】 Iodine. If the general ration is naturally deficient of iodine, fortification of items such as salt or monosodium glutamate should be considered.\n【328】 Vacine-Preventable Diseases\n【329】 - Measles - Diphtheria - Pertussis - Tetanus - Polio - Tuberculosis - Meningitis\n【330】 # Overview\n【331】 Only measles immunization should be part of the initial emergency relief effort; however, a complete EPI should be planned as an integral part of an ongoing long-term health program. Diphtheria, tetanus toxoids (TT) and pertussis vaccine (DTP), oral polio vaccine (OPV), and bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccinations are recommended. None should not be undertaken, however, unless the following criteria are met: the population is expected to remain stable for at least 3 months; the operational capacity to administer vaccine is adequate, and the program can be integrated into the national immunization program within a reasonable length of time.\n【332】 It is essential that adequate immunization records be kept. At the very minimum, personal immunization cards (i.e., \"Road to Health\" cards) should be issued.\n【333】 In addition, a central register of all immunizations is desirable.\n【334】 # Measles\n【335】 Priority. Measles vaccination campaigns should be assigned the highest priority early in emergency situations. Measles immunization programs should begin as soon as the necessary personnel, vaccine, cold chain equipment, and other supplies are available. Measles immunization should not be delayed until other vaccines become available or until cases of measles have been reported.\n【336】 In refugee populations fleeing from countries with high immunization coverage rates, measles immunization should still be accorded high priority. Studies of urban populations (e.g., Kinshasa, Zaire) and densely populated refugee camps (e.g., camps in Malawi) have shown that large outbreaks of measles may still occur even if vaccine coverage rates exceed 80%. For example, in a camp of 50,000 refugees, approximately 10,000 would be children less than 5 years of age. If the vaccine coverage rate was 80% and vaccine efficacy was 90%, approximately 2,800 children in this camp would still be susceptible to measles. In addition, certain countries achieved high coverage in the 12 to 23 month age group, leaving large numbers of older children unprotected.\n【337】 # Program management.\n【338】 Responsibilities for each aspect of the immunization program need to be explicitly assigned to agencies and persons by the coordination agency.\n【339】 The national EPI should be involved from the outset of the emergency. National guidelines regarding immunization should be applied in refugee settings.\n【340】 A pre-immunization count should be conducted to estimate the number of children eligible for vaccination. This should not be allowed, however, to delay the start of the vaccination program.\n【341】 # Choice of vaccine.\n【342】 The standard Schwarz vaccine is recommended. The use of medium or high titer Edmonston-Zagreb (E-Z) vaccine is not yet recommended for refugee populations, since there are still concerns about its safety.\n【343】 Target population. During the emergency phase, defined as that time during which the CMR is higher than 1/10,000/day, all children ages 6 months-5 years should be vaccinated upon arrival at the camp.\n【344】 In long-term refugee health programs, vaccination should be targeted at all children ages 9 months-5 years, except during outbreaks when the lower age limit should again be dropped to 6 months.\n【345】 Any child who has been vaccinated between the ages of 6 and 9 months should be revaccinated as soon as possible after reaching 9 months of age, or 1 month later if the child was 8 months old at first vaccination.\n【346】 If there is insufficient vaccine available to immunize all susceptible children, the immunization program should be targeted at the following high-risk groups, in order of priority:\n【347】 - Undernourished or sick children ages 6 months-12 years who are enrolled in feeding centers or inpatient wards. - All other children ages 6-23 months.\n【348】 - All other children ages 24-59 months. Older children, adolescents, and adults may also need to be immunized if surveillance data show that these groups are being affected during an outbreak.\n【349】 Undernutrition is not a contraindication for measles vaccination! Undernutrition should be considered a strong indication for vaccination. Similarly, fever, respiratory tract infection, and diarrhea are not contraindications for measles vaccination. Unimmunized persons who are infected with HIV should receive the vaccine. Measles vaccine should also be administered in the presence of active TB (1).\n【350】 Outbreak control. Measles immunization programs should not be stopped or postponed because of the presence of measles in the camp or settlement. On the contrary, immunization efforts should be accelerated.\n【351】 Among persons who have already been exposed to the measles virus, measles vaccine may provide some protection or modify the clinical severity of the disease, if administered within 3 days of exposure.\n【352】 Isolation of patients with measles is not indicated in an emergency camp setting.\n【353】 Case management. All children who develop clinical measles in refugee camps should have their nutritional status monitored and be enrolled in a feeding program if indicated.\n【354】 Children with measles complications should be administered standard treatment, e.g., ORT for diarrhea and antibiotics for acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI).\n【355】 If they have not received vitamin A during the previous month, all children with clinical measles should receive 200,000 IU vitamin A orally. Children less than 12 months of age should receive 100,000 IU. This should be repeated every 3 months as part of the routine vitamin A supplementation schedule.\n【356】 Children with complicated measles (pneumonia, otitis, croup, diarrhea with moderate or severe dehydration, or neurological problems) should receive a second dose of vitamin A on day 2.\n【357】 If any eye symptoms of vitamin A deficiency are observed (xerosis, Bitot's spots, keratomalacia, or corneal ulceration), the following treatment schedule should be followed: 200,000 IU oral vitamin A on day 1 200,000 IU oral vitamin A on day 2 200,000 IU oral vitamin A 1-4 weeks later.\n【358】 Children less than 12 months of age receive half doses.\n【359】 # Diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis\n【360】 Once a comprehensive EPI has been established, all children ages 6 weeks-5 years should receive three doses of DTP, 4-8 weeks apart.\n【361】 # Poliomyelitis\n【362】 One dose of OPV should be administered at birth, followed by three doses 4-8 weeks apart to all children 6 weeks-5 years of age.\n【363】 Tuberculosis BCG vaccination should be offered as part of the comprehensive EPI, rather than as a separate TB program. One dose of BCG is administered subcutaneously at birth. Recommendations for TB control are presented in a separate section.\n【364】 # Neonatal tetanus\n【365】 All women between the ages of 15-44 years should receive a full schedule of TT vaccination.\n【366】 Vaccination should commence at a younger age if girls less than 15 years of age commonly bear children in the refugee community. TT vaccination should be included as part of a standard antenatal care program. Female health workers should be employed to educate women about the need for the TT vaccination and to refer pregnant women to the antenatal care clinic. Although WHO recommends a 5-dose schedule for TT vaccination (see \"WHO Tetanus Toxoid Vaccination Schedule\"), the number of doses of TT administered varies from country to country. The schedule in refugee camps should be consistent with host country national policies.\n【367】 # Meningococcal meningitis\n【368】 Surveillance. In areas where epidemics of meningococcal meningitis are known to occur, as in Africa's \"meningitis belt,\" surveillance for meningitis should be a routine part of a HIS. Such surveillance requires a standard case definition, the identification (in advance) of laboratory facilities and a source of supplies (e.g., spinal needles, antiseptics, test tubes), and a clearly established reporting network.\n【369】 Outbreak identification and control. If an outbreak of meningococcal meningitis is suspected, early priority should be given to the determination of etiology and serogroup. This may be accomplished through the use of latex agglutination tests. It is also important to determine antibiotic resistance patterns. Cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) or petechial washings should be placed in suitable transport media and kept at 37 C during transport to a local or regional laboratory with the capacity to perform the needed analysis. If transport media are unavailable, CSF specimens should be placed in a test tube and transported at body temperature as soon as possible.\n【370】 After an outbreak has been confirmed, a presumptive diagnosis of meningococcal meningitis among persons with suggestive symptoms and signs can be made by visual inspection of CSF from lumbar punctures; CSF will appear cloudy in probable cases. Clinical characteristics include fever, severe headache, neck stiffness, vomiting, and photophobia.\n【371】 Endemic rates of meningococcal disease vary by geographic area, season, and age; thus it is not possible to define a rate that can be applied universally to identify an epidemic disease. In one study, an average incidence rate of disease that exceeded 15 cases/100,000/week for a period of 2 consecutive weeks was predictive of an epidemic (defined as greater than 100 cases/100,000). Since this threshold may only be valid for populations greater than 100,000 and because the population in a refugee camp may be unknown, a doubling of the baseline number of cases from 1 week to the next over a period of 3 weeks may be used as a rough indicator of a meningitis outbreak.\n【372】 # Vaccination.\n【373】 Vaccination of refugees against meningococcal meningitis during nonepidemic periods is generally not considered to be an effective measure because of the short duration of protection in young children. If there are compelling reasons to believe that the refugee population is at high risk for an epidemic, preventive vaccination before the meningitis season may be warranted. In the event of an outbreak, vaccination should be considered if the following criteria are met:\n【374】 - The presence of meningococcal disease is laboratory confirmed.\n【375】 - Serogrouping indicates the presence of group A or group C organisms.\n【376】 - The disease is affecting children greater than 1 year of age (for group A) or greater than or equal to 2 years (for group C).\n【377】 If it is logistically feasible, the household contacts of identified cases should be checked for vaccination status and immunized if necessary. It may be simpler to organize a mass immunization program.\n【378】 Because cases of meningococcal meningitis are likely to cluster geographically within a refugee camp, it may be most efficient to focus the vaccination campaign on the affected area(s) first. Although the target group for immunization should be determined from the epidemiology of the specific outbreak, vaccination of children and young adults between the ages of 1-25 years will generally cover the at-risk population.\n【379】 # Chemoprophylaxis .\n【380】 Mass chemoprophylaxis is ineffective for control of epidemic meningococcal disease and is to be discouraged in a refugee setting. If chemoprophylaxis is to be instituted, the following guidelines should be implemented:\n【381】 - Chemoprophylaxis should be administered simultaneously to all members of a household where an infected person has been diagnosed to prevent reinfection.\n【382】 Recovering patients should receive chemoprophylaxis to eliminate carriage. - Adults: 600 mg rifampicin twice a day for 2 days.\n【383】 - Children greater than 1 month old: 10 mg/kg rifampicin twice a day for 2 days.\n【384】 - Neonates: 5 mg/kg rifampicin twice a day for 2 days. Rifampicin should not be administered to pregnant women.\n【385】 Patients should be warned that the drug will temporarily turn the urine and saliva orange.\n【386】 Ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin may be used as alternatives to rifampicin. These drugs, like rifampicin, are expensive and are generally not considered appropriate in a refugee setting. Because of widespread resistance, sulfonamides should not be used unless susceptibility tests show the organism to be sensitive. Widespread use of rifampicin may encourage drug resistance and could cause iatrogenic morbidity due to adverse drug reactions.\n【387】 Treatment. IV-administered penicillin, which requires relatively intensive nursing care and medical equipment, is the treatment of choice for meningococcal disease in developed countries. However, in areas where such intensive care is not possible, a single intramuscular (IM) dose of long-acting chloramphenicol in oil suspension (Tifomycin) upon admission has been demonstrated to be effective. The dosage should be adjusted for age as follows:\n【388】 - greater than or equal to 15 years of age, 3.0 g (6 mL).\n【389】 - 11-14 years of age, 2.5 g (5 mL).\n【390】 - 7-10 years of age, 2.0 g (4 mL).\n【391】 - 3-6 years of age, 1.5 g (3 mL).\n【392】 - 1-2 years of age, 1.0 g (2 mL).\n【393】 - less than 1 year old, 50 mg/kg.\n【394】 In about 25% of cases, a second dose of chloramphenicol will be needed. Patients should be admitted as inpatients and monitored closely to determine whether the additional dose is required. The efficacy of this regimen of one or two doses of IM chloramphenicol has been proven in studies in both Europe and Africa.\n【395】 Febrile seizures are common in small children, and acetaminophen (paracetamol) in either oral suspension or rectal suppositories should be administered to patients upon admission.\n【396】 # Typhoid and cholera\n【397】 Vaccination for typhoid or cholera is not recommended in refugee situations. The resources required for such a campaign are better spent on improving sanitation conditions (see \"Diarrheal Diseases\").\n【398】 # Diarrheal Diseases\n【399】 The critical elements of a diarrheal disease control program in a refugee camp are: a) prevention of morbidity, b) prevention of mortality through appropriate case management, c) surveillance for morbidity and mortality attributed to diarrheal diseases, and d) preparedness for outbreaks of severe diarrheal diseases (e.g., cholera and dysentery). The objectives of a camp diarrheal diseases control program should include the following:\n【400】 - Maintaining the incidence of diarrheal cases at less than 1% per month.\n【401】 - Achieving a CFR of less than 1% for diarrheal cases, including cholera.\n【402】 # Prevention\n【403】 Efforts aimed at reducing the incidence of diarrheal diseases and other enterically transmitted diseases should focus primarily on the provision of adequate quantities of clean water, improvements in camp sanitation, promotion of breast-feeding, and personal hygiene education.\n【404】 The following recommendations relating to water and sanitation are largely based on the UNHCR Handbook for Emergencies (1) and Environmental Health Engineering in the Tropics (2).\n【405】 Water. In general, the supply of adequate quantities of water to refugees in a camp setting has greater overall impact on health than a supply of small quantities of microbially pure water. The provision of adequate quantities of water is particularly effective in the prevention of bacillary dysentery. Nevertheless, whenever possible, sources of clean water should be sought or disinfection systems established. An additional health benefit derived from the provision of ample supplies of water, at a convenient distance from the camp, is the decrease in the daily workload of women, upon whom the burden of water collection usually falls.\n【406】 Appropriate water sources should be identified before refugees arrive in an area. An adequate water supply is a crucial component of attempts to prevent disease and protect health and, as such, should be among the highest priorities for camp planners and administrators.\n【407】 Standards. WHO has set standards for the microbiological quality of water supplies. These are as follows:\n【408】 - For treated water supplies, the water entering the system should be free from coliforms. The water at the tap should be free of coliforms in 95% of samples taken over a 1-year period and should never have greater than 10 coliforms/100 mL. E. coli should never be present in the water. - For untreated water supplies, less than 10 coliforms/100 mL and no evidence of E.coli.\n【409】 The water quality should be tested before using a water source, at regular intervals thereafter, and during any outbreak of diarrheal disease in which the water source may be implicated. Sources. Whatever water source is chosen, it must be protected from contamination. Safety measures include:\n【410】 - Springs protected by a spring box.\n【411】 - Wells equipped with a well head, drainage apron, and a pulley, windlass, or pump.\n【412】 - Surface water, such as lakes, dams, or rivers, provided there there is a large mass of moving water. If surface water is to be used, water for drinking should be drawn upstream, away from obvious sources of contamination. - Rainwater is not generally a practical source in a refugee setting.\n【413】 Treatment. The selection of a water source should take into consideration the potential need for water treatment. Whether or not treatment is needed, the water should be tested routinely to ensure that it is of suitable quality.\n【414】 When surface water is used as a communal source, covered storage will allow suspended particles to settle on the bottom, improving the quality of the water. Longer standing times and higher temperatures will yield a greater improvement in water quality.\n【415】 Filtration and chlorination may require considerable effort and resources, but should be considered if the situation warrants.\n【416】 Although boiling is an effective means of removing water pathogens, it is not generally a practical solution in refugee camps where fuel supplies are limited.\n【417】 As a short-term measure during an emergency (e.g., a cholera outbreak, and when treatment of all water sources is not feasible), purification agents (such as chlorine) may be distributed to each household. In this way, water can be treated in household storage containers. However, a massive education effort is required and such measures usually cannot be maintained for longer than a few weeks.\n【418】 Water storage containers with narrow necks or covers that prevent people from introducing their hands into the container are likely to reduce further contamination of water once it is stored in the home. The use of separate containers to store water for drinking and water for washing is preferable.\n【419】 Supply. The chosen water supply should be adequate to meet the needs of the camp yearround. Seasonal variations in rainfall and in camp population should be taken into consideration when selecting a water source.\n【420】 The UNHCR recommends that a minimum quantity of 20 L of water/person/day be provided. Health clinics, feeding centers, and hospitals require 40-60 L/patient/day.\n【421】 Ideally, no individual dwelling should be located greater than 150 m from a water source. At any greater distance, the use of water for hygiene is greatly diminished.\n【422】 Sanitation. Camp sanitation plans should be drawn up before refugees arrive. Because of the crucial role it plays in disease prevention, sanitation should be an early priority for camp planners.\n【423】 Community attitudes and cultural practices regarding sanitation and disposal of excreta are vital to the success of a sanitation project and should be taken into careful consideration. All efforts should be made to separate garbage and human waste from water and food supplies. Excreta should be contained within a specific area. Defecation fields may be used as a short-term measure until a more appropriate sanitation system can be implemented. This is particularly suitable in hot, dry climates.\n【424】 The design and installation of latrines should also take into consideration the attitudes and practices of the refugee population. Latrines should be located so as to remove the possibility of contamination of the water source.\n【425】 Latrines that are poorly maintained will not be used. For this reason, personal or family latrines are the best solution. However, limitations on building supplies, money, and space may make this impossible. If communal latrines are to be used, no more than 20 people should share one latrine and responsibility for maintaining cleanliness should be clearly assigned.\n【426】 # Breast-feeding.\n【427】 Breast-feeding is an effective measure for preventing diarrheal illness among infants. Exclusive breast-feeding for the first 4-6 months of a baby's life, and continued breast-feeding until the child is 2 years of age, should be encouraged through educational campaigns targeted at pregnant and lactating women. Distribution of milk products should be restricted, and feeding bottles should never be distributed within a camp (see \"Nutrition\").\n【428】 Personal hygiene. Community health education should reinforce the importance of handwashing with soap and of general domestic and personal hygiene, in particular safe foodhandling practices. Soap should be made readily available by relief agencies.\n【429】 # Case management\n【430】 Assessment (see \"Patient Assessment\"\n【431】 ). An adequate history should be taken from the patient or the patient's family. The duration of illness; quantity, frequency, and consistency of stool; presence or absence of blood in the stool; frequency of vomiting; and the presence of fever or convulsions should be assessed.\n【432】 Assessment of dehydration and fluid deficit through careful physical examination should receive particular attention. Fever, rapid breathing, and hypovolemic shock may accompany severe dehydration.\n【433】 Careful monitoring of the patient's weight and the signs of dehydration throughout the course of therapy will help assess the adequacy of rehydration. Adults with acute, dehydrating diarrhea should be carefully assessed by a physician to rule out cholera.\n【434】 # Management of patients.\n【435】 In the camp setting, all patients with diarrhea should be encouraged to report to a clinic or health post for assessment, advice on feeding, fluid intake, and diarrhea prevention. The treatment of dehydration should always be initiated in the clinic. Ideally, a central clinic should be supplemented with several small ORT centers in the camp, staffed by trained community health workers.\n【436】 # Prevention of dehydration.\n【437】 Case management should focus on the prevention of dehydration under two sets of circumstances: a) when a patient with diarrhea shows no signs of dehydration, b) when a patient has already been treated for dehydration in the ORT corner and is being released from medical care. Management of patients in these situations includes the following.\n【438】 # ORS.\n【439】 Mothers should be shown how to mix and give ORS and initially be given a 2-day supply. The amount to be given at home is as follows.\n【440】 - Children less than 2 years old: 50-100 mL (1/4 to 1/2 large cup) of ORS solution after each stool. - Older children: 100-200 mL after each stool.\n【441】 - Adults: As much as they want; however, dehydrated adults who fail to respond promptly to ORS should be reassessed to exclude cholera.\n【442】 # Increased fluids.\n【443】 Patients should be instructed to increase their normal intake of fluids. Any locally available fluids known to prevent dehydration, especially those that can be prepared in the home (e.g., cereal-based gruels, soup, and rice water), should be encouraged. Soft drinks are not recommended because of their high osmolality.\n【444】 Continued feeding. Infants who are breast-fed should continue to receive breast milk. If an infant is receiving milk formula in a feeding center, the milk should be diluted with an equal volume of clean water until the diarrhea stops.\n【445】 For children greater than 4-6 months of age:\n【446】 - Give freshly prepared foods, including mixes of cereal and beans or cereal and meat, with a few drops of vegetable oil added. - Offer food every 3-4 hours or more often for very young children.\n【447】 - Encourage the child to eat as much as he or she wants.\n【448】 - After the diarrhea stops, give one extra meal each day for a week.\n【449】 Monitor condition. The mother should be advised to return to the clinic with the child if he/she continues to pass many stools, is very thirsty, has sunken eyes, has a fever, or does not generally seem to be getting better.\n【450】 # Management of the dehydrated patient\n【451】 Every health center in a refugee camp should have an area allocated for supervised oral rehydration (see \"Guidelines for Rehydration Therapy\"). Staff assigned to this activity need to be well-trained in the assessment and treatment of the dehydrated patient. Individual patients should be monitored to determine whether the recommended doses are adequate for their needs or whether rehydration proceeds faster than is expected.\n【452】 For babies who are unable to drink but are not in shock, a nasogastric tube can be used to administer ORS solution at the rate of 15 mL/kg body weight/hour. For infants in shock, a nasogastric tube should be used only if IV equipment and fluids are not available.\n【453】 Reassessment. The patient's hydration status should be reassessed after 3-4 hours, and treatment continued according to the degree of dehydration at that time. Note: If the child is still dehydrated, rehydration should continue in the center. The mother should offer the child small amounts of food.\n【454】 If the child is less than 12 months of age, the mother should be advised to continue breastfeeding. If the child is not being breast-fed, 100-200 mL of clean, plain water should be given before continuing the ORS. Older children and adults should consume plain water as often as they wish throughout the course of rehydration with ORS solution.\n【455】 Nutritional maintenance. Infants should resume feeding as outlined above. For children greater than 4-6 months old and adults, feeding should begin as soon as the appetite returns. Energy-rich, easily digestible foods will help maintain their nutritional status. There is no reason to delay feeding until the diarrhea stops and there is no justification for \"resting\" the bowel through fasting. Note: Children enrolled in SFPs or TFPs who develop diarrhea with dehydration should be fed HEM diluted with ORS in a ratio of 1:1, alternating with plain ORS. The overall volume of fluid should be calculated according to the child's weight and degree of dehydration.\n【456】 Use of chemotherapy. Antimicrobial drugs are contraindicated for the routine treatment of uncomplicated, watery diarrhea. Specific indications for their use include:\n【457】 - Cholera.\n【458】 - Shigella dysentery.\n【459】 - Amoebic dysentery.\n【460】 - Acute giardiasis. For specific recommendations see \"Cholera\" and \"Dysentery\". Antidiarrheal agents are contraindicated for the treatment of diarrheal disease. Stimulants, steroids, and purgatives are not indicated for treatment of diarrheal disease and may produce adverse effects.\n【461】 # Surveillance for Diarrheal Diseases\n【462】 All health facilities that serve the refugee population should maintain case records of diarrheal diseases as part of the routine HIS. Records should include the degree of dehydration at the time of presentation. Case definitions should be standardized. Dysentery cases should be recorded as a separate category.\n【463】 Any increase in the number or severity of cases, change in the type of diarrhea, rise in diarrhea-specific mortality, or change in the demographic breakdown of the cases should be reported. A case definition for cholera should be established for the purpose of surveillance. Any suspected cholera cases should be reported immediately.\n【464】 Sample case definitions for cholera and dysentery are provided below.\n【465】 # Cholera\n【466】 Identification of the pathogen by laboratory culture is necessary to confirm the presence of cholera. Initially, rectal swabs of patients with suspected cholera should be transported to the laboratory in Cary-Blair transport medium (see Collecting, Processing, Storing and Shipping Diagnostic Specimens in Refugee Health-Care Environments - ). The laboratory should determine the antibiotic sensitivity of the cultured strain. Once an outbreak is confirmed, it is not necessary to culture every case. Additionally, it is not necessary to wait until an outbreak has been confirmed to begin treatment and preventive measures.\n【467】 # Epidemics\n【468】 In the event of an outbreak of cholera, early case-finding will allow for rapid initiation of treatment. Aggressive case-finding by trained community health workers should be coupled with community education to prevent panic and to promote good domestic hygiene.\n【469】 Treatment centers should be easily accessible. Most patients can be treated with ORS alone in the local clinic and still achieve a CFR less than 1%. If the attack rate for cholera is high, it may be necessary to establish temporary cholera wards to handle the patient load. Health centers should be adequately stocked with ORS, IV fluids, and appropriate antibiotics. Health workers must be trained in the management of cholera.\n【470】 Surveillance should be intensified and should change from passive to active case-finding. The number of new cholera cases and deaths should be reported daily, along with other relevant information (e.g., age, sex, location in camp, length of stay in camp).\n【471】 # Treatment\n【472】 The goal of cholera treatment is to maintain the CFR at less than 1%.\n【473】 # Rehydration therapy\n【474】 Rehydration needs to be aggressive. However, careful supervision is necessary to prevent fluid overload, especially when children are rehydrated with IV fluids. Most cases of cholera can be treated through the administration of ORS solution (see \"Patient Assessment\" and \"Guidelines for Rehydration Therapy\". Persons with severe disease may require IV fluid, which should be administered following the guidelines outlined in \"Diarrheal Diseases\".\n【475】 # Antibiotics\n【476】 Antibiotics reduce the volume and duration of diarrhea in cholera patients. Antibiotics should be administered orally. Doxycycline should be used when available in a single dose of 300 mg for adults and 6 mg/kg/day for children less than 15 years of age. Tetracycline should be reserved for severely dehydrated persons, who are the most efficient transmitters because of their greater fecal losses. Tetracycline should be administered according to the following schedule.\n【477】 - Adults: 500 mg every 6 hours for 72 hours - Children: 50 mg/kg/day every 6 hours for 72 hours Chloramphenicol can be used as an alternative to tetracycline; the dosage is the same. When tetracycline and chloramphenicol resistance is present, furazolidone, erythromycin, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) may be used.\n【478】 # Epidemiologic investigation\n【479】 Epidemiologic studies to determine the extent of the outbreak and the primary modes of transmission should be conducted so that specific control measures can be applied. The CFR should be monitored closely to evaluate the quality of treatment.\n【480】 Case-control studies may be undertaken to identify risk factors for infection. Environmental sampling, examination of food, and the use of Moore swabs for sewage sampling may be useful to confirm the results of epidemiologic studies and define modes of transmission.\n【481】 # Control and prevention\n【482】 Health education. The community should be kept informed as to the extent and severity of the outbreak, as well as educated on the ease and effectiveness of treatment. Emphasis should be placed on the benefits of prompt reporting and early treatment. The community should be advised about suspected vehicles of transmission. The need for good sanitation, personal hygiene, and food safety should be stressed. Health workers involved in treating cholera patients need to observe strict personal hygiene, by washing their hands with soap after examining each patient. Smoking should be prohibited in cholera wards and clinics.\n【483】 Water supply. Any water supplies implicated through epidemiologic studies should be tested. Any contaminated water sources should be identified and access to those sources cut off. Alternative sources of safe drinking water should be identified and developed as a matter of urgency.\n【484】 Food safety. Community members should be informed of any food item that has been implicated as a possible vehicle of transmission. Health education messages regarding food preparation and storage should be disseminated.\n【485】 During an outbreak, feeding centers should be extremely vigilant in the preparation of meals because of the potential for mass infection. Food workers should have easy access to soap and water for handwashing. Food workers should always wash their hands after defecating, and any food worker who is experiencing diarrhea should be prohibited from working.\n【486】 Chemoprophylaxis . Mass chemoprophylaxis is not an effective cholera control measure and is not recommended. Although the WHO Guidelines for Cholera Control suggest that chemoprophylaxis may be justified for closed groups (such as refugee camps), CDC studies indicate that focusing on other preventive activities (i.e., providing an adequate water supply, improving camp sanitation, and providing adequate and prompt treatment) results in a more effective use of resources. If resources are adequate and transmission rates are high (greater than 15%), consideration should be given to providing a single dose of doxycycline to immediate family members of diagnosed patients.\n【487】 Vaccines. Currently available vaccines are not recommended for the control of cholera among refugee populations. The efficacy of these vaccines is low and the duration of protection provided is short. Vaccination campaigns divert funds and personnel from more important cholera control activities and give refugee and surrounding populations a false sense of security.\n【488】 # Dysentery\n【489】 When possible, patients presenting with signs and symptoms of dysentery should have stool specimens examined by microscopy to identify Entamoeba histolytica. Care should be taken to distinguish large white cells (a nonspecific indicator of dysentery) from trophozoites. Amebic dysentery tends to be misdiagnosed.\n【490】 # Shigellosis\n【491】 If a microscope is unavailable for diagnosis, or if definite trophozoites are not seen, persons with bloody diarrhea should be treated initially for shigellosis. Appropriate treatment with antimicrobial drugs decreases the severity and duration of dysentery caused by Shigella and reduces the duration of pathogen excretion. The selection of an antimicrobial treatment regimen is often complicated by the presence of multiresistant strains of Shigella. The choice of a first-line drug should be based on knowledge of local susceptibility patterns. If no clinical response occurs within 2 days, the antibiotic should be changed to another recommended for that particular strain of shigellosis. If no improvement occurs after an additional 2 days of treatment, the patient should be referred to a hospital or laboratory for stool microscopy. At this stage, a diagnosis of resistant shigellosis is still more likely than amebiasis.\n【492】 Drugs of choice. Treatment guidelines for shigellosis are listed below.\n【493】 - Ampicillin Children: 100 mg/kg/day in four divided doses for 5 days. Adults: 500 mg four times daily for 5 days. - TMP-SMX Children: 10 mg/kg/day TMP and 50 mg/kg/day SMX in two divided doses for 5 days.\n【494】 Adults: 160 mg TMP and 800 mg SMX twice daily for 5 days.\n【495】 For strains resistant to these regimens, alternative treatment with nalidixic acid or tetracycline is indicated.\n【496】 - Nalidixic acid 55 mg/kg/day in four divided doses for 5 days. - Tetracycline 50 mg/kg/day in four divided doses for 5 days.\n【497】 The fluoroquinolones (e.g., ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin) are highly effective for the treatment of shigellosis, but are expensive and have not yet been approved for treatment of children or pregnant or lactating women with shigellosis.\n【498】 Because multiresistant strains of Shigella have become widespread and because Shigella strains can rapidly acquire resistance in endemic and epidemic settings, it is advisable that periodic antibiotic susceptibility testing be performed by a reference laboratory in the region. Note: WHO does not recommend mass prophylaxis or prophylaxis of family members as a control measure for shigellosis.\n【499】 # Amebiasis and giardiasis\n【500】 Treatment for amebiasis or giardiasis should not be considered unless microscopic examination of fresh feces shows amebic or Giardia trophozoites, or two different antibiotics given for shigellosis have not resulted in clinical improvement.\n【501】 Treatment guidelines for amebiasis are as follows:\n【502】 - Metronidazole Children: 30 mg/kg/day for 5-10 days.\n【503】 Adults: 750 mg/3 times/day for 5-10 days. Treatment guidelines for giardiasis are as follows:\n【504】 - Metronidazole Children: 15 mg/kg/day for 5 days. Adults: 250 mg/3 times/day for 5 days.\n【505】 diagnosis of malaria. These smears will also provide the basis for transmission surveillance in camps or geographic areas. If the patient load exceeds the capability of the laboratory to perform thick smears on all suspected cases, a system of microscopic diagnosis for a percentage of suspected cases should be established. When diagnoses are made by locally trained microscopists in small field laboratories, a randomly selected sample of both positive and negative slides should be sent to a reference laboratory for verification in order to maintain quality control.\n【506】 When laboratory facilities are not available, clinical symptoms (paroxysmal fever, chills, sweats, and headache) and signs (measured fever) are the best predictors of malaria infection.\n【507】 In situations in which year-round high malaria endemicity has been established, all episodes of fever illness can be assumed to be caused by Plasmodium falciparum. However, health workers should bear in mind other causes of fever, including pneumonia, ALRI, or meningitis. In areas where transmission is highly seasonal, surveys should be conducted each year at the beginning of the high transmission season.\n【508】 The presence of Plasmodium on blood smears does not prove that malaria is the cause of febrile illness, even in areas where malaria is highly prevalent. Other causes should be considered and ruled out.\n【509】 Treatment with chemotherapy. In areas without chloroquine resistance, the oral regimen of chloroquine usually employed in the treatment of uncomplicated attacks of malaria is as follows:\n【510】 - Adults: A total dose of 1,500 mg chloroquine (approximately 25 mg/kg body weight) should be given during a 3-day period. This can be given as 600 mg, 600 mg, and 300 mg at 0, 24, and 48 hours, respectively. - Pregnant women: Pregnant women with malaria should be treated aggressively using the regimen for adults. Chloroquine is safe during pregnancy. (Quinine is also safe although pregnant women receiving IV-administered quinine should be monitored carefully for hypoglycemia.) - Children: A total dose of 25 mg/kg body weight chloroquine should be given during a 3-day period. This can be administered as 10 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, and 5 mg/kg body weight at 0, 24 and 48 hours, respectively.\n【511】 In areas where the likelihood of reinfection is low, consideration may be given to supplementation of chloroquine treatment with primaquine for persons infected with Plasmodium vivax.\n【512】 - Adults: 15 mg daily for 14 days.\n【513】 - Children: 0.3 mg/kg/day.\n【514】 Among populations in which severe glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD) deficiency is common (notably among Asians), however, primaquine should not be administered for greater than 5 days. Administration of primaquine for longer periods may result in lifethreatening hemolysis. Whenever possible, persons needing primaquine should first have a blood test for G-6-PD deficiency.\n【515】 When laboratory analysis is performed, the first dose of chloroquine should be administered when the blood smear is taken. The patient should be instructed to return the second day for the results of the smear. If the smear is positive, chemotherapy should be continued. If the smear is negative and the patient remains febrile, other causes of fever should be identified.\n【516】 If supervised therapy during a 3-day period is not possible, the first dose of chloroquine should be given under supervision and the additional doses may be given to the patient with appropriate instructions.\n【517】 Patients who remain symptomatic longer than 3 days into therapy should have a repeat thick smear examined. Alternative therapy should be instituted if the degree of parasitemia has not diminished markedly by this time.\n【518】 In areas with chloroquine resistance, treatment of patients may be the same as in areas of chloroquine-sensitive malaria; or may include an alternative first-line drug. Additional care in the follow-up of patients is required.\n【519】 - If the patient continues to have symptoms of malaria after 48-72 hours from the start of recommended chloroquine treatment, the patient should be treated with a secondline drug. - The choice of an alternative drug depends on the availability of the drugs and the relative sensitivity of the parasites. Possible alternative drugs include sulfa drugs in combination with pyrimethamine (Fansidar, Maloprim), tetracycline, quinine, and newer drugs such as mefloquine. Use of alternative drugs should be consistent with national malaria control policies in the host country.\n【520】 Fever control. Antipyretics (i.e., acetaminophen, paracetamol) and anticonvulsives are often necessary for the care of the patient with malaria.\n【521】 Children with high fevers should be frequently sponged with tepid water. Patients should increase their intake of fluids as the febrile illness will most likely be accompanied by mild dehydration. Patients with signs of moderate dehydration should be given ORS.\n【522】 # Chemoprophylaxis\n【523】 During epidemics (seasons of high rates of transmission), malaria chemoprophylaxis should be considered for the following high-risk groups:\n【524】 - Children less than 5 years of age, especially those suffering from malnutrition, anemia, or other debilitating diseases. - Pregnant women.\n【525】 - Other groups that are at increased risk for complications of malaria illness due to compromised health status.\n【526】 The decision to provide chemoprophylaxis to high-risk persons should be based upon the capabilities of the health-care system to accomplish the following:\n【527】 - At-risk persons can be readily identified and assembled.\n【528】 - Follow-up can be assured.\n【529】 - Sufficient personnel and medication are available to ensure regular administration of services. - The parasite is known to be generally sensitive to the drug used.\n【530】 Administration of chemoprophylaxis to high-risk groups can be logistically difficult and may be too great a strain on the capacities of the health-care system to be feasible.\n【531】 Expatriates working in an endemic area should be on weekly chloroquine ( 300 mg chloroquine base) during the entire period of exposure and for an additional 6 weeks after leaving the area. In areas where chloroquine resistance is documented, prophylaxis with mefloquine is recommended (250 mg weekly dose).\n【532】 # Severe malaria\n【533】 Severe malaria is considered a medical emergency and demands prompt and specific medical care. Signs and symptoms of severe malaria include:\n【534】 - Severe anemia.\n【535】 - Hemoglobinuria, oliguria, or anuria.\n【536】 - Hypotension and respiratory distress.\n【537】 In the presence of signs of volume depletion, fluid (which includes dextrose) should be administered to maintain cardiac output and renal perfusion.\n【538】 - Care in the administration of fluid therapy is required, since fluid overload can precipitate pulmonary edema or adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which can worsen cerebral edema. - The IV fluid of choice is 5% dextrose with 1/2 normal saline, since this mixture provides dextrose to prevent hypoglycemia and less salt to leak into pulmonary and cerebral tissues. Alternative IV fluids should be considered if this is unavailable.\n【539】 Hypoglycemia is a complicating factor in patients with cerebral malaria and a risk factor for fatal outcome. When possible, blood glucose levels should be monitored. Hypoglycemia should be suspected whenever there is a deterioration in clinical status, especially in the presence of new neurologic findings. Hypoglycemia can be treated presumptively with 50 mL of 50% IV dextrose.\n【540】 Blood transfusion is indicated when Hb less than 4 g/dL, or Hb less than 6 g/dL is detected and the patient has signs of heart failure (i.e., dyspnea, enlarging liver, gallop rhythm).\n【541】 The administration of steroids has an adverse effect on outcome in cerebral malaria. Therefore, steroids are no longer recommended.\n【542】 # Anemia\n【543】 Most anemias caused by malaria will reverse spontaneously after anti-malarial therapy. However, anemia may progress for several weeks after successful treatment of severe malaria and may require treatment.\n【544】 For some patients (especially children), blood transfusion may be lifesaving. Recent studies indicate that blood transfusion should be given for Hb less than 4 g/dL or Hb less than 6 g/dL in the presence of symptoms of respiratory distress. Because of the potential for HIV or hepatitis B transmission, blood transfusion should be reserved for medical emergencies for which no alternative treatment exists. Facilities for screening blood for HIV antibodies are rare in refugee camps. Whenever feasible, patients requiring transfusion should be transferred to hospitals where such facilities exist.\n【545】 The anemia of malaria is not associated with iron loss, and replacement is helpful only if a coexisting iron deficiency exists. Folic acid replacement may be helpful during the recovery period when rapid erythrocyte replacement occurs.\n【546】 # Renal failure\n【547】 Replacement of fluid losses (sweat, vomit, and diarrhea) is recommended to prevent renal failure. If renal failure is suspected, strict monitoring of fluid intake and output is necessary.\n【548】 In the presence of oliguria, a fluid challenge followed by furosemide injection can help to differentiate acute renal failure from prerenal causes. If renal failure is demonstrated, fluid intake must be limited to daily replacement of insensible loss plus urine/vomitus volume in the previous 24 hours. Protein intake should be limited to less than 30 mg/day, and all drug doses should be adjusted for renal failure.\n【549】 Selected Reading Ministry of Health. Malawi guidelines for the management of malaria. Malawi, October 1991. CDC. Steketee RW, Campbell CC. Control of malaria among refugees and displaced persons. Atlanta, GA :1988 (unpublished).\n【550】 - The accessibility of cases.\n【551】 - The level of expertise of available health personnel.\n【552】 - The amount of subjectivity involved in the diagnosis.\n【553】 A case-finding mechanism should be established. The dynamics of this system will depend upon the disease being investigated and the specific attributes of the camp involved. Casefinding will be facilitated if a cadre of refugee community health workers has been identified and trained. The presence of an active camp health committee will also promote effective case-finding.\n【554】 Time, place, and person. Certain information should be collected from each patient, or from their families, and recorded in a register. This should include:\n【555】 - The date (and perhaps the time) of onset of symptoms.\n【556】 - The length of time between arrival in camp and the onset of symptoms.\n【557】 - Patient's age and gender.\n【558】 - Place of residence.\n【559】 - Ethnic group (if applicable).\n【560】 Determining who is at risk. The data collected from patients should be used in an ongoing analysis to determine who is at greatest risk and to target specific interventions most effectively.\n【561】 Prepare a graph showing the number of cases per day. This \"epidemic curve\" will indicate the point at which the outbreak first occurred, the magnitude of the outbreak, the incubation period, and possible modes of transmission.\n【562】 Using a current map of the camp, mark the residence or section of the camp of each case as it is reported. This will allow investigators to identify clusters of patients and may help to pinpoint a common source of infection.\n【563】 A breakdown of cases by age, gender, length of stay in camp, vaccination status, if pertinent, and perhaps ethnic group will enable investigators to identify those groups or persons who are at highest risk for infection.\n【564】 Testing a hypothesis. As preliminary data are collected and analyzed, a hypothesis on the causative exposure should be developed and tested. A case-control study and analysis will help determine likely risk factors and sources of exposure. Laboratory analysis of environmental samples may be used to confirm a suspected source of infection.\n【565】 Preparing a report. Meetings should be held regularly with camp administrative officials, UNHCR and NGO representatives, local health officials, and refugee community leaders to discuss the evolution of the outbreak and to stress current control measures. In some cases, a written report may be necessary before any control and prevention efforts are undertaken. The report should include an estimate of the magnitude and health impact of the outbreak in numbers of projected cases and deaths. It should also include an estimation of the need for outside assistance and supplies. A written report will also provide a valuable record for use in future investigations. Moreover, the written report can serve as a useful teaching tool.\n【566】 # Control and prevention\n【567】 As the epidemiologic investigation progresses, it is important that decision-makers be informed as to the findings so that appropriate control measures may be instituted. Continued disease surveillance will determine the effectiveness of control measures.\n【568】 Discharge criteria. Discharge from a TFP to a SFP should occur when the following criteria are met:\n【569】 - The child has maintained 80% WFH (or a Z-score of -2) for a period of 2 weeks.\n【570】 - Weight gain has occurred without edema.\n【571】 - The child is active and free from obvious illness.\n【572】 - The child exhibits a good appetite.\n【573】 # Monitoring requirements\n【574】 - A register should be maintained with the details of each patient.\n【575】 - Each patient should be given a personal ration card and an identification bracelet.\n【576】 - Each patient should be weighed daily at first, and then twice weekly to monitor progress. - TFPs should aim for a weight gain of 10 g/kg body weight/day.\n【577】 - All absentees should be followed up at home and encouraged to resume attendance.\n【578】 - Regular nutrition surveys should be conducted, and malnourished children who are not enrolled in a feeding program should be referred to either the SFP or the TFP. Feeding programs should aim for at least 80% enrollment and 80% daily attendance.\n【579】 In addition, health workers should be involved in active case-finding in the community.\n【580】 # Provision of micronutrients\n【581】 Ideally, the recommended daily allowances for all essential nutrients should be provided in the general rations. However, specific measures may be necessary to provide certain micronutrients.\n【582】 Vitamin A Risk factors for vitamin A deficiency. Provide vitamin A supplements whenever any of the following conditions are present:\n【583】 - The refugee population originates from a geographic area at high risk for vitamin A deficiency. - There is evidence of severe vitamin A deficiency in the population.\n【584】 - The general ration provides inadequate quantities of vitamin A (less than 2,000-2,500 IU/person/day).\n【585】 # Supplemental doses and schedule\n【586】 - Children 12 months 5 years of age should receive 200,000 IU every 3 months.\n【587】 - Infants less than 12 months of age should receive 400,000 IU total dose in the first year of life, administered as follows: - If a dose can be assured every 3 months: 100,000 IU to the infant every 3 months for 1 year. - If 3-month dosing is impractical but 6-month dosing is anticipated: 200,000 IU to the infant every 6 months for 1 year. - If any subsequent dosing is unlikely: 200,000 IU to the infant when examined.\n【588】 In all cases, mothers should be administered 200,000 IU within 2 months of giving birth in order to provide adequate quantities of vitamin A in the breast milk. If it is not possible to provide supplements to the mother at or within 2 months of giving birth, then the mother should receive 100,000 IU during the third trimester of pregnancy.\n【589】 - If xerophthalmia is observed in older children and adults, include the affected age groups in the standard 200,000 IU preventive vitamin A supplementation program administered to younger children.\n【590】 # Malaria\n【591】 Knowledge of the epidemiology of transmission, including local vectors, is essential to a malaria control effort. Information regarding the local epidemiology may be available from the MOH, WHO, and regional health authorities. In certain instances, a vector survey may need to be done. The national malaria control program or WHO staff are often able to conduct such surveys.\n【592】 Information on previous exposure can be obtained from the refugees themselves, or more detailed information on previous exposure to specific species can be obtained through international channels via WHO.\n【593】 Within a camp, the proportion of fever illness attributable to malaria at a particular time can be determined by obtaining thick and thin blood smears from a sample of consecutive clinic patients with a history of recent fever (e.g., 50 children less than 5 years of age). The malaria infection prevalence rate among these patients can then be compared with a control group that is free of the signs and symptoms of malaria.\n【594】 Laboratory examination will determine whether malaria illness is caused by Plasmodium falciparum or Plasmodium vivax.\n【595】 # Control of Transmission\n【596】 Control of malaria transmission may be achieved through a combination of the following strategies.\n【597】 Personal protection. The use of protective clothing, insecticide-impregnated bed nets, and insect repellents will help limit human exposure to malaria-infected mosquitoes.\n【598】 Residual insecticides. Periodic spraying of the inside surfaces of permanent dwellings may reduce transmission. The use of residual insecticides, however, may be toxic to those involved in spraying and can also be detrimental to the environment. Spraying can be expensive and time consuming. Careful consideration should be given to the technical aspects of spraying, local vector behavior and susceptibility, personnel training, safety, and community motivation before undertaking such a program.\n【599】 # Source reduction.\n【600】 The elimination of breeding sites by draining or filling may reduce the density of vectors in the area. Knowledge of the local vectors is essential to ensure that source reduction efforts are effectively targeted.\n【601】 Ultra low-volume insecticide spraying. Adult mosquitoes may be killed through frequent fogging with nonresidual insecticides. Fogging is generally repeated on a daily basis.\n【602】 # Gametocidal drug use.\n【603】 Gametocidal drugs (e.g., primaquine) are not generally recommended for use in refugee camps.\n【604】 Selection of control strategies will depend upon the local epidemiologic factors, availability of resources, and environmental and cultural factors.\n【605】 # Case Management\n【606】 Case definition. Malaria infection is defined as the presence of malaria parasites in the peripheral blood smear. Malaria illness is defined as the presence of \"malaria signs and symptoms\" in the presence of malaria infection. The signs and symptoms of malaria typically include fever, chills, body aches, and headache.\n【607】 Diagnosis. If possible, a thick blood smear and Giemsa stain should be the basis for the - Jaundice.\n【608】 - Hemorrhagic diatheses.\n【609】 - Cerebral malaria. Signs of abnormal central nervous system (CNS) function, which may be present in cerebral malaria, include drowsiness, mental confusion, coma, and seizures.\n【610】 Management of severe malaria. The following guidelines for the management of severe malaria are based upon those prepared by the MOH in Malawi.\n【611】 Outpatient setting. If severe malaria is diagnosed in an outpatient setting, the patient should be referred for hospitalization. However, treatment should begin immediately and not be delayed until the patient has been transferred.\n【612】 If the patient can swallow, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) tablets (500 mg-25 mg) should be administered orally in the following doses according to the patient's age.\n【613】 - less than 3 years old: 1/2 tablet - 4-8 years old: 1 tablet - 9-14 years old: 2 tablets - greater than 14 years old: 3 tablets If the patient vomits within 30 minutes, the dose should be repeated.\n【614】 If the patient cannot swallow or is vomiting repeatedly, an IM injection of quinine dihydrochloride (10 mg/kg) should be administered. This can be repeated every 4 hours for two additional doses, and every 8 hours thereafter if a long delay is anticipated for transport of the patient to a hospital. The patient's fever should be reduced by sponging with lukewarm water or by using paracetamol or aspirin. Patients should be given ORS. In a patient who cannot drink, administer 20 mL/kg ORS with one teaspoon of glucose powder via naso-gastric tube every 4 hours.\n【615】 If convulsions occur, administer 0.2 mL/kg paraldehyde by IM injection. If convulsions recur, repeat the treatment. If convulsions persist, give the patient a phenobarbitone 10-mg/kg IM injection.\n【616】 In a child with altered consciousness or repeated convulsions, the physician should perform a lumbar puncture if possible. If the CSF is cloudy, treatment for meningococcal meningitis is indicated and anti-malarial treatment should be discontinued. If a lumbar puncture cannot be performed, treatment for meningitis should be administered while continuing treatment for malaria.\n【617】 Inpatient setting. The following tests should be performed immediately upon admission: thick blood film, hemoglobin, blood glucose, and lumbar puncture. If hemoglobin is below 4 g/dL, blood grouping and cross-matching should be done.\n【618】 If the patient can swallow, give oral SP as described above. If the patient cannot swallow or has persistent vomiting, give IV-administered quinine as follows:\n【619】 - An initial dose of 20 mg(salt)/kg body weight is injected into 10 mL/kg 5% dextrose (half-strength Darrow's solution) and infused during a 3-hour period. (If the patient has already received quinine before admission, the initial dose should be 10 mg/kg.) - Subsequent doses of 10 mg/kg should be repeated as above every 12 hours. In between doses of quinine, the IV fluid (10 mL/kg during a 3-hour period) should be continued. Patients should be switched to oral medications as soon as their conditions allow.\n【620】 # Tuberculosis\n【621】 The TB control program should establish a policy covering areas of case definition, casefinding, treatment regimen, and the supervision of chemotherapy. This policy should be agreed upon and adhered to by all organizations and agencies providing health services to the refugees.\n【622】 During the emergency phase of a refugee relief operation, TB activities should be limited to the treatment of patients who present themselves to the health-care system and in whom tubercle bacilli have been demonstrated by sputum smear examination.\n【623】 # Control of transmission Target population.\n【624】 Because of the limited resources available, efforts to control transmission of TB within a refugee settlement should focus on the primary sources of infection, i.e., those patients for whom microscopic analysis of sputum smears demonstrates the presence of acid-fast bacilli (AFB). (Specimens should be stained using the Ziehl-Neelsen method with the results graded quantitatively.)\n【625】 Case identification. Passive case-finding will be most efficient in the refugee setting. Patients with respiratory symptoms (chest pain, cough) of greater than 3 weeks' duration, hemoptysis of any duration, or significant weight loss should have a direct microscopic examination of their sputum for AFB. If the sputum smear is negative for AFB but pulmonary TB is still suspected, the patient should be given a 10-day course of antibiotics and then be reexamined after 2-4 weeks. Specific anti-TB chemotherapy should not begin unless the presence of AFB has been confirmed. Symptomatic family members of an identified patient should also have sputum specimens examined.\n【626】 Children who show signs and symptoms compatible with TB and who are either: a) a close contact of a patient with a confirmed case of TB, or b) tuberculin skin-test positive (in the absence of a BCG vaccination scar) should undergo a full course of anti-TB treatment if they do not respond to an appropriate regimen of alternative antibiotics.\n【627】 Case management. The selection of a first-line chemotherapy regimen should generally be consistent with the national policy set forth by the host country MOH. However, it should be recognized that the crowded conditions of a refugee camp may foster an abnormally high rate of transmission. Additionally, uncertainty exists regarding the duration of stay in the country of asylum, and it may be more difficult to maintain adherence to an extended therapy regimen. Short-course therapy (6 months) should be considered for use in a refugee camp even when the national policy prescribes a longer course of treatment, provided the additional expense is not prohibitive.\n【628】 Before enrolling refugees in a TB treatment program, consideration should be given to the stability of the populations and the capacity of the health-care program to supervise therapy and to follow-up patients who do not adhere to treatment. Administration of anti-TB drugs to persons in whom adherence is likely to be sporadic will foster increased drug resistance in that population.\n【629】 The following drugs are used for the treatment of TB with chemotherapy: isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, streptomycin, ethambutol, and thiacetazone. The selection of a particular treatment regimen must take into consideration the organism susceptibility, cost, and duration of therapy. The decision regarding implementation of a specific therapeutic regimen will generally be made by the UNHCR in consultation with the MOH of the host government. Case-holding. Whenever possible, chemotherapy should be observed by a health-care provider, especially during the first 2-3 months of treatment. Treatment efficacy should be assessed through a series of sputum smears. Patients participating in observed therapy who do not respond to treatment and whose sputum smears remain positive for AFB after 2 months should be reviewed by a physician and should begin a second-line treatment regimen.\n【630】 Enrolling TB patients in a SFP may improve adherence to the treatment regimen and acts as a point of contact for follow-up.\n【631】 The success of a TB control program depends on good management and close supervision. The responsibilities of staff assigned to the program need to be clearly defined, adequate records of patient progress should be maintained, and a system to follow-up patients who do not adhere to treatment should be established. The cooperation of the community is essential for success. A community education program should be established to help ensure adherence.\n【632】 # Prevention\n【633】 Preventive chemotherapy for subclinical TB usually does not play a substantial role in TB control in a refugee camp. However, immediate family members of active TB patients should be examined for active TB and referred for treatment. This is particularly important for young children.\n【634】 BCG vaccination should be administered as part of the comprehensive immunization schedule and not as a separate TB control activity. BCG vaccination is contraindicated for persons with symptomatic HIV infection, but can be administered to asymptomatic persons. In: Allegra DT, Nieburg P, Grabe M, eds. Emergency refugee health care --a chronicle of the Khmer refugee-assistance operation 1979-19801983:61-4.\n【635】 # Selected Reading\n【636】 # Epidemic Investigations\n【637】 An epidemic is an unusually large or unexpected increase in the number of cases of a certain disease for a given place and time period. The general conditions of many refugee settlements (i.e., overcrowding, poor water and sanitation, inadequate rations) create an environment conducive to epidemics of infectious diseases. In the event of a suspected outbreak, an epidemiologic investigation should be conducted as quickly as possible.\n【638】 # Purpose\n【639】 Epidemiologic investigations are conducted in order to:\n【640】 - Confirm the threat or existence of an epidemic and identify the causative agent, its source and mode of transmission. - Determine the geographic distribution and the public health impact of an epidemic, identifying those groups or persons who are at highest risk for disease. - Assess local response capacity and identify the most effective control measures.\n【641】 # Preparations\n【642】 Each camp should have an established HIS with standardized reporting practices. This will allow for prompt recognition of and rapid response to an epidemic.\n【643】 An accurate assessment of available laboratory facilities is necessary in order to identify appropriate sites for microbiologic confirmation of an epidemic and to address deficiencies that may hamper an investigation.\n【644】 Appropriate specimen containers and transport media should be procured. Arrangements should be made to meet the need for additional technical support.\n【645】 A recognized administrative and reporting structure should be established, with a clear chain of command and delegation of responsibility. Lines of command should be well defined, and specific persons should be assigned responsibility for addressing the media and acting as liaisons to the camp leaders and the refugee population.\n【646】 Current maps showing settlements, water sources, transport routes, and health facilities should be made available to investigators.\n【647】 # Conducting the investigation Determining the existence of an epidemic.\n【648】 An established HIS will allow for prompt recognition and confirmation of an epidemic. The need for routine health surveillance in a refugee camp cannot be overstated. Even if such a system is firmly in place and implemented, reports of an epidemic may be the result of artifactual causes, i.e., changes in reporting practices, an increased interest in a particular disease, a change in diagnostic methods, the arrival of new health staff, or an increase in the number of health facilities.\n【649】 Confirming the diagnosis. The diagnosis of an epidemic disease should be confirmed using standard clinical or laboratory techniques. However, once the presence of an epidemic is established, it is not necessary to confirm the diagnosis for each person before treatment. Ongoing laboratory confirmation of a sample of cases is generally sufficient.\n【650】 # Determining the number of cases.\n【651】 A workable case definition must be established in order to determine the scope of the outbreak. The sensitivity and specificity of the case definition depend upon:\n【652】 - The usual apparent-to-inapparent case ratio.\n【653】 - Whether pathognomonic signs and symptoms exist.\n【654】 - The need for laboratory support for diagnosis.\n【655】 Selected Reading CDC Monograph.

It is also used to treat people with type 2 diabetes (condition in which the blood sugar is too high because the body does not produce or use insulin normally) who need insulin to control their diabetes. Insulin glulisine is a man-made version of human insulin that begins working quickly and continues to work for a short time to control increases in blood sugar that may occur after meals. It is used together with a longer-acting insulin or an insulin pump (a device that delivers insulin to the body at all times through a small tube that is inserted under the skin) to control blood sugar. Insulin glulisine works by helping move sugar from the blood into other body tissues where it is used for energy. It also stops the liver from producing more sugar.\n【3】 # How this medication should be used\n【4】 Insulin glulisine comes as a solution (liquid) to inject subcutaneously (under the skin). It is usually injected up to 15 minutes before a meal or within 20 minutes after starting a meal. Insulin glulisine can also be infused under the skin using an external insulin pump. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use insulin glulisine exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n【5】 Never use insulin glulisine when you have symptoms of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) or if you have checked your blood sugar and found it to be low. Call your doctor in these cases.\n【6】 Insulin glulisine controls diabetes but does not cure it. Continue to use insulin glulisine even if you feel well. Do not stop using insulin glulisine without talking to your doctor. Do not switch to another brand or type of insulin or change the dose of any type of insulin you are using without talking to your doctor.\n【7】 Insulin glulisine comes in vials and in cartridges.The cartridges are designed to be placed in dosing pens. Be sure you know what type of container your insulin glulisine comes in and what other supplies, such as needles, syringes, or pens, you will need to inject your medication.\n【8】 If your insulin glulisine comes in vials, you will need to use syringes or an insulin pump to inject your dose. Always use a syringe marked for U-100 insulin to be sure that you get the right dose. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have questions about the type of syringe you should use. Carefully read the manufacturer's instructions to learn how to draw insulin glulisine into a syringe and inject your dose. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have questions about how to inject your dose.\n【9】 If your insulin glulisine comes in cartridges, you will need to buy an insulin pen separately. Check the manufacturer's information to see what type of pen is right for insulin glulisine cartridges . Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions about the type of pen you should use. Carefully read the instructions that come with your pen, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to show you how to use it.\n【10】 Never reuse needles or syringes and never share needles, syringes, cartridges, or pens. If you are using an insulin pen, always remove the needle right after you inject your dose. Throw away needles and syringes in a puncture-resistant container. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how to dispose of the puncture- resistant container.\n【11】 Insulin glulisine may be mixed only with NPH insulin (Novolin N, Humulin N) to be injected using a syringe. Do not mix or dilute insulin glulisine with any other type of insulin. If you mix insulin glulisine with NPH insulin, draw insulin glulisine into the syringe first, then draw the NPH insulin into the syringe and inject the solution immediately after mixing.If you use insulin glulisine in an insulin pump, do not dilute insulin glulisine or mix it with any other insulin or solution.\n【12】 Always look at your insulin glulisine before you inject it. It should be as clear, colorless, and fluid as water. Do not use your insulin glulisine if it is colored, cloudy, thickened, or contains solid particles, or if the expiration date on the bottle has passed.\n【13】 If you use syringes or a pen, you may inject insulin glulisine into your upper arm; stomach area, except for a two inch circle around the navel (belly button); or upper leg. If you use an insulin pump, infuse insulin glulisine into your stomach area. Never inject insulin glulisine into muscles or veins,or in or near moles or scars. Use a different site for each injection, about 1 inch away from the previous injection site but in the same general area (for example, the thigh). Use all available sites in the same general area before switching to a different area (for example, the upper arm).\n【14】 If you use insulin glulisine in an insulin pump, change the tubing and needle and throw away any solution left in the reservoir at least every 48 hours. You should also change the infusion site (spot where the pump is attached to the body) at least every 48 hours.You may need to change the needles, tubing, infusion site, and medication more often if the medication has been exposed to high temperatures or direct sunlight, if your blood sugar increases unexpectedly, if the skin around the infusion site becomes irritated, or if there are problems with your pump. Be sure that you know what to do if you have any problems with your pump. Your blood sugar may increase very quickly if your pump stops working, and you may need to inject insulin with a syringe. Read the manufacturer's information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n【15】 # Other uses for this medicine\n【16】 This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n【17】 # Special precautions\n【18】 Before using insulin glulisine:\n【19】 - tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to insulin (Humulin, Novolin, others) or any other medications.\n【20】 - tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take. Be sure to mention any of the following: angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors such as benazepril (Lotensin), captopril (Capoten), enalapril (Vasotec), fosinopril (Monopril), lisinopril (Zestril), moexipril (Univasc), perindopril, (Aceon), quinapril (Accupril), ramipril (Altace), and trandolapril (Mavik); albuterol (Proventil, Ventolin, Vospire ER); antihistamines; beta blockers such as atenolol (Tenormin), labetalol (Normodyne), metoprolol (Lopressor, Toprol XL), nadolol (Corgard), and propranolol (Inderal); clonidine (Catapres, Catapres-TTS, ); danazol; diazoxide (Proglycem); disopyramide (Norpace);; diuretics ('water pills'); epinephrine (Bronitin Mist, EpiPen, Primatene Mist); fenofibrate (Antara, Lipofen, Tricor); fluoxetine (Prozac, Sarafem); gemfibrozil (Lopid); glucagon (Glucagen); guanethidine (Ismelin); hormone replacement therapy; isoniazid (INH, Laniazid); lithium (Eskalith, Lithobid); medications for asthma, colds, irregular menstrual bleeding, and nausea; certain medications for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) including amprenavir (Agenerase), atazanavir (Reyataz), fosamprenavir (Lexiva), indinavir (Crixivan), lopinavir (in Kaletra), nelfinavir (Viracept), ritonavir (in Kaletra, Norvir), saquinavir (Invirase), and tipranavir (Aptivus); certain antipsychotics (medications for mental illness) including clozapine (Clozaril, Fazaclo) and olanzapine (Zyprexa, in Symbyax); monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors such as isocarboxazid (Marplan), phenelzine (Nardil), selegiline (Eldepryl, Emsam, Zelapar), and tranylcypromine (Parnate); hormonal contraceptives (birth control pills, patches, rings, injections, or implants); oral medications for diabetes; oral steroids such as dexamethasone (Decadron, Dexone), methylprednisolone (Medrol), and prednisone (Deltasone); pentoxifylline (Pentoxil, Trental); propoxyphene (Darvon, in Darvocet, in Wygesic); reserpine (Serpalan); salicylate pain relievers such as aspirin; somatropin (Humatrope, Norditropin, Nutropin); sulfa antibiotics; terbutaline (Brethine); and thyroid medications. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.\n【21】 - tell your doctor if you have or have ever had nerve damage caused by your diabetes or kidney or liver disease.\n【22】 - tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while using insulin glulisine, call your doctor.\n【23】 - if you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are using insulin glulisine.\n【24】 - ask your doctor what to do if you get sick, experience unusual stress, plan to travel across time zones, or change your exercise and activity level. These changes can affect your blood sugar and the amount of insulin you may need.\n【25】 # Special dietary instructions\n【26】 Be sure to follow all exercise and dietary recommendations made by your doctor or dietitian. It is important to eat a healthy diet and to eat about the same amounts of the same kinds of food at about the same times each day. Skipping or delaying meals or changing the amount or kind of food you eat can cause problems with your blood sugar control.\n【27】 Alcohol may cause a decrease in blood sugar. Ask your doctor about the safe use of alcoholic beverages while you are using insulin glulisine.\n【28】 # What to do if you forget a dose\n【29】 Insulin glulisine must be injected up to 15 minutes before or within 20 minutes after starting a meal. If some time has passed since your meal, check your blood sugar and call your doctor to find out whether you should inject the missed dose. Do not inject a double dose to make up for a missed one.\n【30】 # Side effects\n【31】 ## Minor side effects\n【32】 Insulin glulisine may cause changes in your blood sugar. You should know the symptoms of low and high blood sugar and what to do if you have these symptoms.\n【33】 You may experience hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) while you are taking this medication. Your doctor will tell you what you should do if you develop hypoglycemia. He or she may tell you to check your blood sugar, eat or drink a food or beverage that contains sugar, such as hard candy or fruit juice, or get medical care. Follow these directions carefully if you have any of the following symptoms of hypoglycemia:\n【34】 - shakiness\n【35】 - dizziness or lightheadedness\n【36】 - sweating\n【37】 - nervousness or irritability\n【38】 - sudden changes in behavior or mood\n【39】 - headache\n【40】 - numbness or tingling around the mouth, hands, or feet\n【41】 - weakness\n【42】 - pale skin\n【43】 - hunger\n【44】 - clumsy or jerky movements\n【45】 - nightmares\n【46】 - difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep\n【47】 - blurred vision\n【48】 - slurred speech\n【49】 - fast heartbeat\n【50】 If hypoglycemia is not treated, severe symptoms may develop. Be sure that your family, friends, and other people who spend time with you know that if you have any of the following symptoms, they should get medical treatment for you immediately.\n【51】 - confusion\n【52】 - seizures\n【53】 - loss of consciousness\n【54】 Call your doctor immediately if you have any of the following symptoms of hyperglycemia (high blood sugar):\n【55】 - extreme thirst\n【56】 - frequent urination\n【57】 - extreme hunger\n【58】 - weakness\n【59】 - blurred vision\n【60】 If high blood sugar is not treated, a serious, life-threatening condition called diabetic ketoacidosis could develop. Get medical care immediately if you have any of these symptoms:\n【61】 - dry mouth\n【62】 - nausea and vomiting\n【63】 - stomach pain\n【64】 - shortness of breath\n【65】 - breath that smells fruity\n【66】 - decreased consciousness\n【67】 Insulin glulisine may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away:\n【68】 - redness, swelling, or itching at the site of the injection\n【69】 - changes in the feel of your skin, skin thickening (fat build-up), or a little indentation in *the skin (fat breakdown)\n【70】 - muscle pain\n【71】 ## Severe side effects\n【72】 Some side effects can be serious. The following symptoms are uncommon, but if you experience any of them, call your doctor immediately:\n【73】 - rash and/or itching over the whole body\n【74】 - shortness of breath\n【75】 - wheezing\n【76】 - dizziness\n【77】 - blurred vision\n【78】 - fast heartbeat\n【79】 - sweating\n【80】 - difficulty breathing or swallowing\n【81】 Insulin glulisine may cause other side effects.

It is a gas at standard temperature and pressure and exists in Earth's atmosphere in this state. It is currently at a globally averaged concentration of approximately 383 ppm by volume in the Earth's atmosphere, although this varies both by location and time. Carbon dioxide is an important greenhouse gas because it transmits visible light but absorbs strongly in the infrared.\n【3】 Carbon dioxide is produced by all animals, plants, fungi and microorganisms during respiration and is used by plants during photosynthesis. This is to make sugars which may either be consumed again in respiration or used as the raw material for plant growth. It is, therefore, a major component of the carbon cycle. Carbon dioxide is generated as a byproduct of the combustion of fossil fuels or vegetable matter, among other chemical processes. Inorganic carbon dioxide is output by volcanoes and other geothermal processes such as hot springs.\n【4】 Carbon dioxide has no liquid state at pressures below 5.1 atm, but is a solid at temperatures below -78 °C. In its solid state, carbon dioxide is commonly called dry ice.\n【5】 CO2 is an acidic oxide: an aqueous solution turns litmus from blue to pink.\n【6】 # Chemical and physical properties\n【7】 Carbon dioxide is a colorless, odorless gas. When inhaled at concentrations much higher than usual atmospheric levels, it can produce a sour taste in the mouth and a stinging sensation in the nose and throat. These effects result from the gas dissolving in the mucous membranes and saliva, forming a weak solution of carbonic acid. This sensation can also occur during an attempt to stifle a burp after drinking a carbonated beverage. Amounts above 5,000 ppm are considered very unhealthy, and those above about 50,000 ppm (equal to 5% by volume) are considered dangerous to animal life.\n【8】 At standard temperature and pressure, the density of carbon dioxide is around 1.98 kg/m³, about 1.5 times that of air. The carbon dioxide molecule (O=C=O) contains two double bonds and has a linear shape. It has no electrical dipole, and as it is fully oxidized, it is moderately reactive and is non-flammable, but will support the combustion of metals such as magnesium.\n【9】 At −78.51° C or -109.3° F, carbon dioxide changes directly from a solid phase to a gaseous phase through sublimation, or from gaseous to solid through deposition. Solid carbon dioxide is normally called \"dry ice\", a generic trademark. It was first observed in 1825 by the French chemist Charles Thilorier. Dry ice is commonly used as a cooling agent, and it is relatively inexpensive. A convenient property for this purpose is that solid carbon dioxide sublimes directly into the gas phase leaving no liquid. It can often be found in grocery stores and laboratories, and it is also used in the shipping industry. The largest non-cooling use for dry ice is blast cleaning.\n【10】 Liquid carbon dioxide forms only at pressures above 5.1 atm; the triple point of carbon dioxide is about 518 kPa at −56.6 °C (See phase diagram, above). The critical point is 7.38 MPa at 31.1 °C.\n【11】 An alternative form of solid carbon dioxide, an amorphous glass-like form, is possible, although not at atmospheric pressure. This form of glass, called carbonia, was produced by supercooling heated CO2 at extreme pressure (40–48 GPa or about 400,000 atmospheres) in a diamond anvil. This discovery confirmed the theory that carbon dioxide could exist in a glass state similar to other members of its elemental family, like silicon (silica glass) and germanium. Unlike silica and germania glasses, however, carbonia glass is not stable at normal pressures and reverts back to gas when pressure is released.\n【12】 # History of human understanding\n【13】 Carbon dioxide was one of the first gases to be described as a substance distinct from air. In the seventeenth century, the Flemish chemist Jan Baptist van Helmont observed that when he burned charcoal in a closed vessel, the mass of the resulting ash was much less than that of the original charcoal. His interpretation was that the rest of the charcoal had been transmuted into an invisible substance he termed a \"gas\" or \"wild spirit\" (spiritus sylvestre).\n【14】 The properties of carbon dioxide were studied more thoroughly in the 1750s by the Scottish physician Joseph Black. He found that limestone (calcium carbonate) could be heated or treated with acids to yield a gas he called \"fixed air.\" He observed that the fixed air was denser than air and did not support either flame or animal life. He also found that when bubbled through an aqueous solution of lime (calcium hydroxide), it would precipitate calcium carbonate. He used this phenomenon to illustrate that carbon dioxide is produced by animal respiration and microbial fermentation. In 1772, English chemist Joseph Priestley published a paper entitled Impregnating Water with Fixed Air in which he described a process of dripping sulfuric acid (or oil of vitriol as Priestley knew it) on chalk in order to produce carbon dioxide, and forcing the gas to dissolve by agitating a bowl of water in contact with the gas.\n【15】 Carbon dioxide was first liquefied (at elevated pressures) in 1823 by Humphry Davy and Michael Faraday. The earliest description of solid carbon dioxide was given by Charles Thilorier, who in 1834 opened a pressurized container of liquid carbon dioxide, only to find that the cooling produced by the rapid evaporation of the liquid yielded a \"snow\" of solid CO2.\n【16】 # Isolation\n【17】 Carbon dioxide may be obtained from air distillation. However, this yields only very small quantities of CO2. A large variety of chemical reactions yield carbon dioxide, such as the reaction between most acids and most metal carbonates. For example, the reaction between sulfuric acid and calcium carbonate (limestone or chalk) is depicted below:\n【18】 The H2CO3 then decomposes to water and CO2. Such reactions are accompanied by foaming or bubbling, or both. In industry such reactions are widespread because they can be used to neutralize waste acid streams.\n【19】 The production of quicklime (CaO) a chemical that has widespread use, from limestone by heating at about 850 °C also produces CO2:\n【20】 The combustion of all carbon containing fuels, such as methane (natural gas), petroleum distillates (gasoline, diesel, kerosene, propane), but also of coal and wood, will yield carbon dioxide and, in most cases, water. As an example the chemical reaction between methane and oxygen is given below.\n【21】 Iron is reduced from its oxides with coke in a blast furnace, producing pig iron and carbon dioxide:\n【22】 Yeast metabolizes sugar to produce carbon dioxide and ethanol, also known as alcohol, in the production of wines, beers and other spirits:\n【23】 All aerobic organisms produce CO2 when they oxidize carbohydrates, fatty acids, and proteins in the mitochondria of cells. The large number of reactions involved are exceedingly complex and not described easily. Refer to (cellular respiration, anaerobic respiration and photosynthesis). Photoautotrophs (i.e. plants, cyanobacteria) use another modus operandi: Plants absorb CO2 from the air, and, together with water, react it to form carbohydrates:\n【24】 Carbon dioxide is soluble in water, in which it spontaneously interconverts between CO2 and H2CO3 (carbonic acid). The relative concentrations of CO2, H2CO3, and the deprotonated forms HCO−3 (bicarbonate) and CO2−3(carbonate) depend on the pH. In neutral or slightly alkaline water (pH > 6.5), the bicarbonate form predominates (>50%) becoming the most prevalent (>95%) at the pH of seawater, while in very alkaline water (pH > 10.4) the predominant (>50%) form is carbonate. The bicarbonate and carbonate forms are very soluble, such that air-equilibrated ocean water (mildly alkaline with typical pH = 8.2 – 8.5) contains about 120 mg of bicarbonate per liter.\n【25】 ## Industrial production\n【26】 Carbon dioxide is manufactured mainly from six processes:\n【27】 - As a byproduct in ammonia and hydrogen plants, where methane is converted to CO2;\n【28】 - From combustion of wood and fossil fuels;\n【29】 - As a byproduct of fermentation of sugar in the brewing of beer, whisky and other alcoholic beverages;\n【30】 - From thermal decomposition of limestone, CaCO3, in the manufacture of lime, CaO;\n【31】 - As a byproduct of sodium phosphate manufacture;\n【32】 - Directly from natural carbon dioxide springs, where it is produced by the action of acidified water on limestone or dolomite.\n【33】 # Uses\n【34】 Carbon dioxide is used by the food industry, the oil industry, and the chemical industry. It is used in many consumer products that require pressurized gas because it is inexpensive and nonflammable, and because it undergoes a phase transition from gas to liquid at room temperature at an attainable pressure of approximately 60 bar (870 psi, 59 atm), allowing far more carbon dioxide to fit in a given container than otherwise would. Life jackets often contain canisters of pressured carbon dioxide for quick inflation. Aluminum capsules are also sold as supplies of compressed gas for airguns, paintball markers, for inflating bicycle tires, and for making seltzer. Rapid vaporization of liquid carbon dioxide is used for blasting in coal mines. High concentrations of carbon dioxide can also be used to kill pests, such as the Common Clothes Moth.\n【35】 Carbon dioxide is used to produce carbonated soft drinks and soda water. Traditionally, the carbonation in beer and sparkling wine comes about through natural fermentation, but some manufacturers carbonate these drinks artificially.\n【36】 A candy called Pop Rocks is pressurized with carbon dioxide gas at about 40 bar (600 psi). When placed in the mouth, it dissolves (just like other hard candy) and releases the gas bubbles with an audible pop.\n【37】 Leavening agents produce carbon dioxide to cause dough to rise. Baker's yeast produces carbon dioxide by fermentation of sugars within the dough, while chemical leaveners such as baking powder and baking soda release carbon dioxide when heated or if exposed to acids.\n【38】 Carbon dioxide is the most commonly used compressed gas for pneumatic systems in portable pressure tools and combat robots.\n【39】 Carbon dioxide extinguishes flames, and some fire extinguishers, especially those designed for electrical fires, contain liquid carbon dioxide under pressure. Carbon dioxide also finds use as an atmosphere for welding, although in the welding arc, it reacts to oxidize most metals. Use in the automotive industry is common despite significant evidence that welds made in carbon dioxide are brittler than those made in more inert atmospheres, and that such weld joints deteriorate over time because of the formation of carbonic acid. It is used as a welding gas primarily because it is much less expensive than more inert gases such as argon or helium.\n【40】 Liquid carbon dioxide is a good solvent for many lipophilic organic compounds, and is used to remove caffeine from coffee. First, the green coffee beans are soaked in water. The beans are placed in the top of a column seventy feet (21 meters) high. The carbon dioxide fluid at about 93 degrees Celsius enters at the bottom of the column. The caffeine diffuses out of the beans and into the carbon dioxide.\n【41】 Carbon dioxide has begun to attract attention in the pharmaceutical and other chemical processing industries as a less toxic alternative to more traditional solvents such as organochlorides. It's used by some dry cleaners for this reason. (See green chemistry.)\n【42】 Plants require carbon dioxide to conduct photosynthesis, and greenhouses may enrich their atmospheres with additional CO2 to boost plant growth, since its low present-day atmosphere concentration is just above the \"suffocation\" level for green plants. A photosynthesis-related drop in carbon dioxide concentration in a greenhouse compartment can kill green plants. At high concentrations, carbon dioxide is toxic to animal life, so raising the concentration to 10,000 ppm (1%) for several hours can eliminate pests such as whiteflies and spider mites in a greenhouse.\n【43】 It has been proposed that carbon dioxide from power generation be bubbled into ponds to grow algae that could then be converted into biodiesel fuel. \n【44】 In medicine, up to 5% carbon dioxide is added to pure oxygen for stimulation of breathing after apnea and to stabilize the O2/CO2 balance in blood.\n【45】 A common type of industrial gas laser is the carbon dioxide laser.\n【46】 Carbon dioxide can also be combined with limonene oxide from orange peels or other epoxides to create polymers and plastics.\n【47】 Carbon dioxide is used in enhanced oil recovery where it is injected into or adjacent to producing oil wells, usually under supercritical conditions. It acts as both a pressurizing agent and, when dissolved into the underground crude oil, significantly reduces its viscosity, enabling the oil to flow more rapidly through the earth to the removal well. In mature oil fields, extensive pipe networks are used to carry the carbon dioxide to the injection points.\n【48】 In the chemical industry, carbon dioxide is used for the production of urea, carbonates and bicarbonates, and sodium salicylate.\n【49】 Liquid and solid carbon dioxide are important refrigerants, especially in the food industry, where they are employed during the transportation and storage of ice cream and other frozen foods. Solid carbon dioxide is called \"dry ice\" and is used for small shipments where refrigeration equipment is not practical.\n【50】 Liquid carbon dioxide (industry nomenclature R744 / R-744) was used as a refrigerant prior to the discovery of R-12 and is likely to enjoy a renaissance due to environmental concerns. Its physical properties are highly favorable for cooling, refrigeration, and heating purposes, having a high volumetric cooling capacity. Due to its operation at pressures of up to 130 bars, CO2 systems require highly resistant components that have been already developed to serial production in many sectors. In car air conditioning, in more than 90% of all driving conditions, R744 operates more efficiently than systems using R-134a. Its environmental advantages (GWP of 1, non-ozone depleting, non-toxic, non-flammable) could make it the future working fluid to replace current HFCs in cars, supermarkets, hot water heat pumps, among others. Some applications: Coca-Cola has fielded CO2-based beverage coolers and the US Army is interested in CO2 refrigeration and heating technology.\n【51】 By the end of 2007, the global car industry is expected to decide on the next-generation refrigerant in car air conditioning. CO2 is one discussed option.(see The Cool War)\n【52】 # In the Earth's atmosphere\n【53】 Carbon dioxide in earth's atmosphere is considered a trace gas currently occurring at an average concentration of about 385 parts per million by volume or 582 parts per million by mass. The mass of the Earth atmosphere is 5.14×1018 kg , so the total mass of atmospheric carbon dioxide is 3.0×1015 kg (3,000 gigatonnes). Its concentration varies seasonally (see graph at right) and also considerably on a regional basis: in urban areas it is generally higher and indoors it can reach 10 times the background atmospheric concentration.\n【54】 Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas; see greenhouse effect for more.\n【55】 Due to human activities such as the combustion of fossil fuels and deforestation, the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide has increased by about 35% since the beginning of the age of industrialization. \n【56】 In 1999, 2,244,804,000 metric tons of CO2 were produced in the U.S. as a result of electric energy generation. This is an output rate of 0.6083 kg (1.341 pounds) per kWh.\n【57】 Five hundred million years ago carbon dioxide was 20 times more prevalent than today, decreasing to 4-5 times during the Jurassic period and then maintained a slow decline until the industrial revolution, with a particularly swift reduction occurring 49 million years ago.\n【58】 Up to 40% of the gas emitted by some volcanoes during subaerial volcanic eruptions is carbon dioxide.  According to the best estimates, volcanoes release about 130-230 million tonnes (145-255 million tons) of CO2 into the atmosphere each year. Carbon dioxide is also produced by hot springs such as those at the Bossoleto site near Rapolano Terme in Tuscany, Italy. Here, in a bowl-shaped depression of about 100 m diameter, local concentrations of CO2 rise to above 75% overnight, sufficient to kill insects and small animals, but warm rapidly when sunlit and disperse by convection during the day Locally high concentrations of CO2, produced by disturbance of deep lake water saturated with CO2 are thought to have caused 37 fatalities at Lake Monoun, Cameroon in 1984 and 1700 casualties at Lake Nyos, Cameroon in 1986. However, emissions of CO2 by human activities are currently more than 130 times greater than the quantity emitted by volcanoes, amounting to about 27 billion tonnes per year (30 billion tons).\n【59】 # In the oceans\n【60】 There is about 50 times as much carbon dissolved in the oceans in the form of CO2 and CO2 hydration products as exists in the atmosphere. The oceans act as an enormous  carbon sink, having \"absorbed about one-third of all human-generated CO2 emissions to date.\"  Generally, gas solubility decreases as water temperature increases. Accordingly carbon dioxide is released from ocean water into the atmosphere as ocean temperatures rise.\n【61】 Most of the CO2 taken up by the ocean forms carbonic acid. Some is consumed in photosynthesis by organisms in the water, and a small proportion of that sinks and leaves the carbon cycle. There is considerable concern that as a result of increased CO2 in the atmosphere the acidity of seawater will increase and may adversely affect organisms living in the water. In particular, with increasing acidity, the availability of carbonates for forming shells decreases.\n【62】 # Biological role\n【63】 Carbon dioxide is an end product in organisms that obtain energy from breaking down sugars, fats and amino acids with oxygen as part of their metabolism, in a process known as cellular respiration. This includes all plants, animals, many fungi and some bacteria. In higher animals, the carbon dioxide travels in the blood from the body's tissues to the lungs where it is exhaled. In plants using photosynthesis, carbon dioxide is absorbed from the atmosphere.\n【64】 ## Role in photosynthesis\n【65】 Plants remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by photosynthesis, also called carbon assimilation, which uses light energy to produce organic plant materials by combining carbon dioxide and water. Free oxygen is released as gas from the decomposition of water molecules, while the hydrogen is split into its protons and electrons and used to generate chemical energy via photophosphorylation. This energy is required for the fixation of carbon dioxide in the Calvin cycle to form sugars. These sugars can then be used for growth within the plant through respiration.\n【66】 Even when vented, carbon dioxide must be introduced into greenhouses to maintain plant growth, as the concentration of carbon dioxide can fall during daylight hours to as low as 200 ppm (a limit of C3 carbon fixation photosynthesis). Plants can potentially grow up to 50 percent faster in concentrations of 1,000 ppm CO2 when compared with ambient conditions.\n【67】 Plants also emit CO2 during respiration, so it is only during growth stages that plants are net absorbers. For example a growing forest will absorb many tons of CO2 each year, however a mature forest will produce as much CO2 from respiration and decomposition of dead specimens (e.g. fallen branches) as used in biosynthesis in growing plants. Regardless of this, mature forests are still valuable carbon sinks, helping maintain balance in the Earth's atmosphere. Additionally, and crucially to life on earth, phytoplankton photosynthesis absorbs dissolved CO2 in the upper ocean and thereby promotes the absorption of CO2 from the atmosphere.\n【68】 ## Toxicity\n【69】 Carbon dioxide content in fresh air varies between 0.03% (300 ppm) and 0.06% (600 ppm), depending on the location (see graphical map of CO2 in real-time).\n【70】 A person's exhaled breath is approximately 4.5% carbon dioxide by volume.\n【71】 Adaptation to increased levels of CO2 occurs in normal men. Continuous inhalation of CO2 can be tolerated at three percent inspired concentrations for at least one month and four percent inspired concentrations for over a week. It was suggested that 2.0 percent inspired concentrations could be used for closed air spaces (ex. Submarine) since the adaptation is physiological and reversible. Decrement in performance or in normal physical activity does not happen at this level.\n【72】 It is dangerous when inhaled in high concentrations (greater than 5% by volume, or 50,000 ppm). The current threshold limit value (TLV) or maximum level that is considered safe for healthy adults for an eight-hour work day is 0.5% (5,000 ppm). The maximum safe level for infants, children, the elderly and individuals with cardio-pulmonary health issues is significantly less.\n【73】 These figures are valid for pure carbon dioxide. In indoor spaces occupied by people the carbon dioxide concentration will reach higher levels than in pure outdoor air. Concentrations higher than 1,000 ppm will cause discomfort in more than 20% of occupants, and the discomfort will increase with increasing CO2 concentration. The discomfort will be caused by various gases coming from human respiration and perspiration, and not by CO2 itself. At 2,000 ppm the majority of occupants will feel a significant degree of discomfort, and many will develop nausea and headaches. The CO2 concentration between 300 and 2,500 ppm is used as an indicator of indoor air quality.\n【74】 Acute carbon dioxide toxicity is sometimes known as by the names given to it by miners: blackdamp (also called choke damp or stythe). Miners would try to alert themselves to dangerous levels of carbon dioxide in a mine shaft by bringing a caged canary with them as they worked. The canary would inevitably die before CO2 reached levels toxic to people. Carbon dioxide caused a great loss of life at Lake Nyos in Cameroon in 1986, when an upwelling of CO2-laden lake water quickly blanketed a large surrounding populated area. The heavier carbon dioxide forced out the life-sustaining oxygen near the surface, killing nearly two thousand people.\n【75】 Carbon dioxide ppm levels (CDPL) are a surrogate for measuring indoor pollutants that may cause occupants to grow drowsy, get headaches, or function at lower activity levels. To eliminate most Indoor Air Quality complaints, total indoor CDPL must be reduced to below 600. NIOSH considers that indoor air concentrations that exceed 1,000 are a marker suggesting inadequate ventilation. ASHRAE recommends they not exceed 1,000 inside a space. OSHA limits concentrations in the workplace to 5,000 for prolonged periods. The U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health limits brief exposures (up to ten minutes) to 30,000 and considers CDPL exceeding 40,000 as \"immediately dangerous to life and health.\" People who breathe 50,000 for more than half an hour show signs of acute hypercapnia, while breathing 70,000 – 100,000 can produce unconsciousness in only a few minutes. Accordingly, carbon dioxide, either as a gas or as dry ice, should be handled only in well-ventilated areas.\n【76】 ## Human physiology\n【77】 CO2 is carried in blood in three different ways. (The exact percentages vary depending whether it is arterial or venous blood).\n【78】 - Most of it (about 70% – 80%) is converted to bicarbonate ions HCO3− by the enzyme carbonic anhydrase in the red blood cells, by the reaction CO2 + H2O → H2CO3 → H+ + HCO3−.\n【79】 - 5% – 10% is dissolved in the plasma\n【80】 - 5% – 10% is bound to hemoglobin as carbamino compounds\n【81】 The CO2 bound to hemoglobin does not bind to the same site as oxygen. Instead, it combines with the N-terminal groups on the four globin chains. However, because of allosteric effects on the hemoglobin molecule, the binding of CO2 decreases the amount of oxygen that is bound for a given partial pressure of oxygen.\n【82】 Hemoglobin, the main oxygen-carrying molecule in red blood cells, can carry both oxygen and carbon dioxide, although in quite different ways. The decreased binding to carbon dioxide in the blood due to increased oxygen levels is known as the Haldane Effect, and is important in the transport of carbon dioxide from the tissues to the lungs. Conversely, a rise in the partial pressure of CO2 or a lower pH will cause offloading of oxygen from hemoglobin. This is known as the Bohr Effect.\n【83】 Carbon dioxide may be one of the mediators of local autoregulation of blood supply. If its levels are high, the capillaries expand to allow a greater blood flow to that tissue.\n【84】 Bicarbonate ions are crucial for regulating blood pH. A person's breathing rate influences the level of CO2 in their blood. Breathing that is too slow or shallow can cause respiratory acidosis, while breathing that is too rapid may lead to hyperventilation, which may cause respiratory alkalosis.\n【85】 Although the body requires oxygen for metabolism, low oxygen levels do not stimulate breathing. Rather, breathing is stimulated by higher carbon dioxide levels. As a result, breathing low-pressure air or a gas mixture with no oxygen at all (such as pure nitrogen) may lead to loss of consciousness. This is especially perilous for high-altitude fighter pilots. It is also why flight attendants instruct passengers, in case of loss of cabin pressure, to apply the oxygen mask to themselves first before helping others — otherwise one risks going unconscious without being aware of the imminent peril.\n【86】 According to a study by the United States Department of Agriculture, an average person's respiration generates approximately 450 liters (roughly 900 grams) of carbon dioxide per day.", "title": "Carbon dioxide", "tags": "", "lang": "", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"https://www.wikidoc.org/index.php/CO2\", \"source\": \"wikidoc\", \"overview\": \"None\", \"id\": \"2003d397100cfe0cad1b51a0d8599011b0aed5b6\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-01-28 23:07:59", "update_time": "2024-02-18 22:29:23"}

Radiation-induced pericarditis was first described in the mid-1960s. The radiation-induced pericardial disease may be classified as acute pericarditis, delayed pericarditis, pancarditis, constrictive pericarditis, and pericardial effusion. Radiation therapy leads to disruption of endothelium and subsequent episodes of ischemia. The resulting fibrosis and fibrinous exudates replace collagen fibers. Radiation-induced pericardial disease can occur in any cancer survivor who receive thoracic radiation therapy, including breast cancer, Hodgkin's lymphoma, esophageal cancer, and lung cancer. Radiation-induced pericarditis depends on the total dose of radiation, the dose per fraction, the amount of cardiac silhouette exposed, and the nature of the radiation source. The incidence is higher with doses greater than 40 Gy (4000 rad). Echocardiography is the most commonly used screening modality for the detection and follow-up of radiation-induced cardiac disease. Acute pericarditis usually develops a few weeks after radiation exposure. Nearly 20% of patients with acute pericarditis develop chronic or constrictive pericarditis in the next 5-10 years following radiation therapy. The risk is increased when pericardial effusion was present previously. Chronic pericarditis can also occur in patients without a history of acute pericarditis. Acute pericarditis is a rare complication of radiation therapy. It presents with nonspecific pericarditis symptoms such as chest pain and fever shortly after radiation therapy. Delayed pericarditis occurs from months to years after exposure to radiation. It usually presents with chest pain, dyspnea, and orthopnea. The physical examination may show fever and pericardial rub. Laboratory findings include elevated inflammatory markers such as neutrophil count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). On ECG, non-specific ST and T wave changes or ST-segment elevation in all leads may be noted. The majority of acute pericarditis cases are self-limited and respond well to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and colchicine. In acute or chronic pericarditis, protein-rich exudate may accumulate in the pericardial sac leading to pericardial effusion. Findings on a chest x-ray or chest CT suggestive of chronic pericarditis include pericardial effusion and pericardial thickening. If the effusion is large enough, it may lead to tamponade. In patients presenting with tamponade, the physical examination may show hypotension, tachycardia, and jugular venous distention with a prominent Y descent, Kussmaul’s sign, and distant heart sound. Radiation-induced pericardial effusion can be confused with malignant pericarditis and hypothyroidism-induced pericarditis. Pericarditis with large effusion can be drained either percutaneously or surgically. Those with recurrent pericardial effusion can be treated with pericardiotomy(pericardial window) or by surgical stripping. Constrictive pericarditis is a late complication of radiation therapy. Patients typically present with signs and symptoms of heart failure, similar to other causes of constrictive pericarditis. Cardiac MRI may be helpful in the diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis. It is useful to confirm the pericardial thickening. Cardiac catheterization may be also helpful in the diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis associated with radiation therapy. Pericardiectomy is recommended for patients who develop constrictive pericarditis. However, the perioperative mortality rate is higher in radiation-induced constrictive pericarditis compared to that of idiopathic constrictive pericarditis. Effective measures for the primary prevention of radiation-induced pericarditis include reducing the dose and volume of cardiac irradiation when possible.\n【3】 # Historical Perspective\n【4】 Radiation-induced pericarditis was first described in the mid-1960s.\n【5】 # Classification\n【6】 Based on the presentation and onset of symptoms, the radiation-induced pericardial disease may be classified as:\n【7】 - Acute pericarditis\n【8】 - Delayed pericarditis\n【9】 - Pancarditis\n【10】 - Constrictive pericarditis\n【11】 - Pericardial effusion\n【12】 # Pathophysiology\n【13】 Radiation therapy disrupts endothelial cells of the microvasculature of the pericardium and leads to repeated episodes of ischemia. The final result is the formation of fibrosis and fibrinous exudates that are ultimately replaced by fibroblasts and collagen fibers .\n【14】 # Causes\n【15】 Radiation-induced pericardial disease can occur in any cancer survivor who receive thoracic radiation therapy, including breast cancer, Hodgkin's lymphoma, esophageal cancer, and lung cancer. However, most data come from patients treated for breast cancer and Hodgkin's lymphoma, in which radiation therapy is a frequent component of management.\n【16】 # Differentiating Radiation-induced Pericarditis from other Diseases\n【17】 - Pericarditis must be differentiated from diseases presenting with chest pain, shortness of breath and tachypnea.\n【18】 For a full discussion of the differential diagnosis of chest pain click here\n【19】 For an expert algorithm that aids in the diagnosis of the cause of chest pain click here\n【20】 - For a full discussion of the differential diagnosis of chest pain click here\n【21】 - For an expert algorithm that aids in the diagnosis of the cause of chest pain click here\n【22】 - Pericarditis must be differentiated from myocardial infarction as an important cause of chest pain.The differentiating features include:\n【23】 - Constrictive pericarditis should be differentiated from restrictive cardiomyopathy:\n【24】 # Epidemiology and Demographics\n【25】 Pericardial changes are the most common cardiac complications of radiation therapy. Incidence of radiation-induced pericarditis has significantly decreased with the use of lower doses and newer radiotherapy techniques . In a study, incidence decreased from 20% to 2.5% with the changes in methods of RT administration\n【26】 In a study among pediatric population with various cancers, radiation therapy with ≥15 GY increased the risk of developing pericarditis by two to six times\n【27】 # Risk Factors\n【28】 Radiation-induced pericarditis depends on:\n【29】 - Total dose of radiation\n【30】 - The dose per fraction\n【31】 - Amount of cardiac silhouette exposed\n【32】 - Nature of the radiation source\n【33】 In a retrospective study, 27.7% of the patients developed pericardial effusion after median time period of 5.3 months following radiotherapy for esophageal carcinoma with radiation dose ranging between 3 to 50Gy. It was concluded that high dose-volume of the irradiated pericardium and heart increased the risk of developing pericarditis.\n【34】 # Screening\n【35】 Echocardiography is the most commonly used screening modality for the detection and follow-up of radiation-induced cardiac disease. It is typically done every two years in asymptomatic individuals and more frequently when symptoms are present.\n【36】 # Natural History, Complications, and Prognosis\n【37】 Acute pericarditis usually develops a few weeks after radiation exposure. Nearly 20% of patients with acute pericarditis develop chronic or constrictive pericarditis in the next 5-10 years following radiation therapy.The risk is increased when pericardial effusion was present previously. Chronic pericarditis can also occur in patients without a history of acute pericarditis.\n【38】 # Diagnosis\n【39】 ## Diagnostic Study of Choice\n【40】 There are no established criteria for radiation induced pericarditis.\n【41】 ## History and Symptoms\n【42】 - Acute pericarditis: acute pericarditis is a rare complication of radiation therapy. It presents with nonspecific pericarditis symptoms such as chest pain and fever shortly after radiation therapy.\n【43】 - Delayed pericarditis: delayed pericarditis occurs from months to years after exposure to radiation . It usually presents with:\n【44】 Chest pain\n【45】 Dyspnea\n【46】 Orthopnea\n【47】 - Chest pain\n【48】 - Dyspnea\n【49】 - Orthopnea\n【50】 - Pericardial effusion: protein-rich exudate may accumulate in the pericardial sac leading to pericardial effusion. Rapid accumulation may result in the development of cardiac tamponade presenting with clinical signs and symptoms of tamponade.\n【51】 - Constrictive pericarditis: constrictive pericarditis is a late complication of radiation therapy. Patients typically present with signs and symptoms of heart failure, similar to other causes of constrictive pericarditis.\n【52】 ## Physical Examination\n【53】 Physical examination of patients with radiation-induced pericarditis depends on the presentation. In acute pericarditis, the physical examination may show fever and pericardial friction rub. In patients presenting with tamponade, the physical examination may show:\n【54】 - Hypotension\n【55】 - Tachycardia\n【56】 - Jugular venous distention with a prominent Y descent\n【57】 - Kussmaul's sign, and distant heart sounds\n【58】 In constrictive pericarditis, signs of congestive heart failure may be present, including:\n【59】 - Hepatomegaly\n【60】 - Ascites\n【61】 - Ankle edema \n【62】 ## Laboratory Findings\n【63】 Laboratory findings consistent with the diagnosis of radiation-induced acute pericarditis include elevated inflammatory markers such as neutrophil count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR).\n【64】 ## Electrocardiogram\n【65】 In acute pericarditis, non-specific ST and T wave changes or ST segment elevation in all leads may be noted.\n【66】 In patients presenting with constrictive pericarditis, electrocardiographic changes are similar to other causes of constrictive pericarditis. Electrocardiographic signs of constrictive pericarditis is usually inconsistent and non specific\n【67】 - Left atrial enlargement\n【68】 - Frequent atrial arrhythmias\n【69】 - Right axis deflection\n【70】 - Possible reduction in voltages\n【71】 - Diffuse negative T-waves\n【72】 - Typical (normal QRS axis, low voltage, and generalized T wave flattening or inversion)\n【73】 - Right ventricular hypertrophy\n【74】 - Right axis deviation\n【75】 ## X-ray\n【76】 A chest x-ray may be helpful in the diagnosis of radiation-induced pericarditis. Findings on an x-ray suggestive of chronic pericarditis include pericardial effusion and pericardial thickening.\n【77】 ## Echocardiography or Ultrasound\n【78】 Echocardiography is the gold standard for definitive diagnosis of acute or chronic pericarditis with pericardial effusion and helps to rule out a cardiac tamponade.\n【79】 ## CT scan\n【80】 A chest CT scan may be helpful in the diagnosis of radiation-induced pericarditis. Findings on a CT scan suggestive of chronic pericarditis include pericardial effusion and pericardial thickening.\n【81】 ## MRI\n【82】 Cardiac MRI may be helpful in the diagnosis of radiation-induced pericarditis. It is useful to confirm the pericardial thickening in chronic and constrictive pericarditis. It is also helpful to assess for concomitant myocardial involvement.\n【83】 ## Other Imaging Findings\n【84】 There are no other imaging findings associated with radiation-induced pericarditis.\n【85】 ## Other Diagnostic Studies\n【86】 Cardiac catheterization may be helpful in the diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis associated with radiation therapy.\n【87】 For more information on cardiac catheterization findings in constrictive pericarditis, click here.\n【88】 ## Pericardiocentesis\n【89】 - Radiation induced pericardial effusion can be confused with malignant pericarditis and hypothyroidism-induced pericarditis.\n【90】 - Pericardiocentesis can be used to differentiate them with fluid analysis for malignant cells and thyroid function tests.\n【91】 - For more information on pericardiocentesis, click here.\n【92】 # Treatment\n【93】 ## Medical Therapy\n【94】 The majority of radiation-induced acute pericarditis cases are self-limited and respond well to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and colchicine. Steroids are associated with a higher chance of relapse and therefore are only used in cases who fail to respond to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents.\n【95】 ## Surgery\n【96】 - Pericarditis with large effusion can be drained either percutaneously or surgically.\n【97】 - Those with recurrent pericardial effusion can be treated with pericardiotomy (pericardial window) or by surgical stripping.\n【98】 - Pericardiectomy is recommended for patients who develop constrictive pericarditis. However, the perioperative mortality rate is higher in radiation-induced constrictive pericarditis compared to that of idiopathic constrictive pericarditis.\n【99】 ## Primary Prevention\n【100】 Effective measures for the primary prevention of radiation-induced pericarditis include reducing the dose and volume of cardiac irradiation when possible.\n【101】 ## Secondary Prevention\n【102】 There are no established measures for the secondary prevention of radiation-induced pericarditis.", "title": "Radiation induced pericarditis", "tags": "", "lang": "", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"overview\": \"None\", \"id\": \"b8647bd3ae5e52fea4df83db66790a76cd0e1274\", \"url\": \"https://www.wikidoc.org/index.php/Radiation_induced_pericarditis\", \"source\": \"wikidoc\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-01-28 23:07:59", "update_time": "2024-02-18 18:58:06"}
{"id": 415482, "user_id": "6576f4e0014d3d1c31d6fe43", "user_name": "曾垂松", "task_id": 143, "source_info": {"seq_id": 14656, "text": "【0】 Early pregnancy factor\n【1】 # Background\n【2】 Early pregnancy factor (EPF) or early conception factor (ECF) is a protein associated with mammalian embryos shortly after fertilization.  It may be composed of more than one molecule.  It was first described in 1976.\n【3】 # Detection\n【4】 Early pregnancy factor is tested for rosette inhibition test.  EPF is present in the maternal serum (blood plasma) shortly after fertilization; EPF is also present in cervical mucus and in amniotic fluid.\n【5】 EPF may be detected in   sheep within 72 hours of mating, in mice within 24 hours of mating, and in samples from media surrounding human embryos fertilized in vitro within 48 hours of fertilization (although another study failed to duplicate this finding for in vitro embryos).  EPF has been detected as soon as within six hours of mating.\n【6】 Because the rosette inhibition test for EPF is indirect, substances that have similar effects may confound the test.  Pig semen, like EPF, has been shown to inhibit rosette formation - the rosette inhibition test was positive for one day in sows mated with a vasectomized boar, but not in sows similarly stimulated without semen exposure.  A number of studies in the years after the discovery of EPF were unable to reproduce the consistent detection of EPF in post-conception females, and the validity of the discovery experiments was questioned.  However, progress in characterization of EPF has been made and its existence is well-accepted in the scientific community.\n【7】 # Origin and function\n【8】 Early embryos are not believed to directly produce EPF.  Rather, embryos are believed to produce some other chemical that induces the maternal system to create EPF.  After implantation, EPF may be produced by the conceptus directly.\n【9】 EPF is an immunosuppresant.  Along with other substances associated with early embryos, EPF believed to play a role in preventing the immune system of the pregnant female from attacking the embryo. Injecting anti-EPF antibodies into mice after mating significantly reduced the number of successful pregnancies and number of pups; no effect on growth was seen when mice embryos were cultured in media containing anti-EPF antibodies.  While some actions of EPF are the same in all mammals (namely rosette inhibition), other immunosuppresant mechanism vary between species.\n【10】 In mice, EPF levels are high in early pregnancy, but on day 15 decline to levels found in non-pregnanct mice.  In humans, EPF levels are high for about the first twenty weeks, then decline, becoming undetectable within eight weeks of delivery.\n【11】 Recent research has suggested that EPF may be associated with cell proliferation in a wide variety of biological situations, not just embryo development.\n【12】 # Clinical utility\n【13】 ## Pregnancy testing\n【14】 In 1979, it was suggested that EPF could be used as a marker for a very early pregnancy test, and as a way to monitor the viability of ongoing pregnancies in livestock.  Interest in EPF for this purpose has continued, although current test methods have not proved sufficiently accurate for the requirements of livestock management.\n【15】 In humans, modern pregnancy tests detect human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG).  hCG is not present until after implantation, which occurs six to twelve days after fertilization.  In contrast, EPF is present within hours of fertilization.  While several other pre-implantation signals have been identified, EPF is believed to be the earliest possible marker of pregnancy.  The accuracy of EPF as a pregnancy test in humans has been found to be high by several studies.\n【16】 ## Birth control research\n【17】 EPF may also be used to determine whether pregnancy prevention mechanism of birth control methods act before or after fertilization.  A study evaluating EPF levels in women with IUDs concluded that post-fertilization mechanisms contribute significantly to the effectiveness of these devices.\n【18】 For groups that define pregnancy as beginning with fertilization, birth control methods that have postfertilization mechanisms are abortifacient.  There is currently contention over whether hormonal contraception methods have post-fertilization methods, specifically the most popular method - the combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP).  The group Pharmicists for Life has called for a large-scale clinical trial to evaluate EPF in women taking COCPs; this would be the most conclusive evidence available to determine whether COCPs have postfertilization mechanisms.\n【19】 ## Infertility and early pregnancy loss\n【20】 EPF is useful when investigating embryo loss prior to implantation.  One study in healthy human women seeking pregnancy detected fourteen pregnancies with EPF.  Of these, six were lost within ten days of ovulation (43% rate of early conceptus loss).\n【21】 Use of EPF has been proposed to distinguish infertility caused by failure to conceive versus infertility caused by failure to implant.  EPF has also been proposed as a marker of viable pregnancy, more useful in distinguishing ectopic or other nonviable pregnancies than other chemical markers such as hCG and progesterone.\n【22】 A study of EPF in women taking clomifene to treat infertility found fertilization rates of about 40%-50% per cycle.  In cycles where fertilization was detected, nearly 80% resulted in subclinical embryonic loss, a rate much higher than that found in healthy women.\n【23】 A study of EPF in women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) concluded that, while a significant number of embryos simply failed to implant, an equally significant number of embryos were likely damaged or killed by the transfer process itself.  The researchers used these findings to call for more attention to the effective transfer of embryos during IVF procedures.\n【24】 ## As a tumour marker\n【25】 Although almost exclusively associated with pregnancy, EPF-like activity has also been detected in tumors of germ cell origin and in other types of tumors.

The QRS complex represents electrical activation of the ventricle and normally the entire process of ventricular depolarization in adults is completed within about 0.1 sec (100 msec).  An IVCD is the result of abnormal activation of the ventricles caused by conduction delay or block in one or more parts of the specialized conduction system (bundle of His, bundle branch or purkinje conduction system) resulting in widening of QRS complex.  Abnormalities of local myocardial activation can further alter the specific pattern of venticular activation.\n【3】 # Anatomy and Physiology\n【4】 Intraventricular conduction delay are due to abnormalities in the specialized conduction system in the ventricles that transmit impulses arising from the SA node transmitted through the AV node to the ventricles.  The normal intraventricular system starts at the AV node as bundle of His that divides into right and left bundle branches which after giving of the fascicular branches ends in the complex Purkinje system.\n【5】 # Classification\n【6】 Intraventricular conduction delay can be caused by structural abnormalities in the bundle of His or Purkinje system or ventricular myocardium, functional refractoriness in a portion of the conduction system (i.e., aberrant ventricular conduction) or ventricular preexcitation over a bypass tract.  Intraventricular conduction disturbances can be broadly classified based upon the underlying physiology or based upon the site of block (anatomical classification).   However, the anatomic description of conduction abnormalities are not intended to localize sites of impaired function precisely because the electrocardiographic changes may be caused by abnormalities in various sites within the ventricles.\n【7】 # Pathophysiology\n【8】 Intraventricular conduction delay involves a variety of disturbances of the His-Purkinje/ventricular conduction system that affects the electrocardiogram (ECG) in distinctive ways and may or may not lead to a wide QRS complex and/or axis deviation.\n【9】 # Causes\n【10】 Intraventricular conduction delays(IVCDs) refers to abnormalities in the intraventricular propagation of supraventricular impulses.  These abnormalities can be due to pathology in either the left bundle of His or its fascicular branches or the right bundle of His or its combination resulting in changes to the QRS complex.  Causes can be classified based upon the site of pathology in the ventricular conduction system as well as the associated medical condition.\n【11】 # Differentiating Intraventricular Conduction Delay from other Disorders\n【12】 Intraventricular conduction delay's need to be differentiated from other conditions resulting in wide QRS complex such as LVH, pacemaker rhythms and accessory pathway arrythmias.\n【13】 # Epidemiology and Demographics\n【14】 Intraventricular condution delay ECG patterns can be seen commonly in general population and their prevalence increases with age.  Bifascicular block (especially RBBB and LAF block) is the most common IVCD.\n【15】 # Natural History, Complications and Prognosis\n【16】 Intraventricular conduction delay usually has no prognostic significance in patients without underlying heart disease but may progress to complete heart block or ventricular arrhythmia with worse prognosis in underlying heart disease.\n【17】 # Diagnosis\n【18】 ## History and Symptoms\n【19】 Intraventricular conduction delays (IVCD) are abnormal ECG pattern, which may or may not be associated with symptoms.  Complete history to find out underlying cardiac condition would be the best approach in asymptomatic patients.\n【20】 ## Physical Examination\n【21】 Physical examination should consist of a thorough cardiac exam, lung exam, and close monitoring of vital signs.  Jugular pulsation may be noted in the neck exam.\n【22】 ## Laboratory Findings\n【23】 Electrophysiological testing help localize the site of conduction delay or block within the conduction system of the ventricles.\n【24】 ## Electocardiogram\n【25】 Intraventricular conduction delay is a common clinical abnormality detected on the electrocardiogram (ECG).  Right and left bundle branch blocks usually reflect intrinsic impairment of conduction in either the right or left bundle system (intraventricular conduction disturbances) which can be either chronic or intermittent.  Transient rate-related bundle branch blocks occurs when the heart rate increases (tachycardia or acceleration-dependent) or when heart rate decreases (bradycardia or deceleration-dependent) which are relatively rare.\n【26】 # Treatment\n【27】 Asymptomatic patients with isolated IVCD and no underlying heart disease require no treatment.  In symptomatic patients, with syncope and AV block may have a rhythm disturbance that requires a pacemaker.  Given the dys-ynchrony that occurs with left ventricular contractility, cardiac resynchronization therapy in heart failure patients may be of benefit.", "title": "Intraventricular conduction delay", "tags": "", "lang": "", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"overview\": \"None\", \"source\": \"wikidoc\", \"url\": \"https://www.wikidoc.org/index.php/Intraventricular_conduction_delay_overview\", \"id\": \"6b34615eb19533de90dd19e8f0f8c16432cd3932\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-01-28 23:07:59", "update_time": "2024-02-18 19:34:44"}

They originate from the dura or arachnoid and occur in middle-aged adults. Women are affected twice as often as men. Meningiomas are well-differentiated, benign, and encapsulated lesions that indent the brain as they enlarge. Parasellar meningiomas commonly involve the cavernous sinus and produce an ophthalmoplegia. Meningiomas can induce an osteoblastic reaction in the adjacent bone, resulting in a characteristic focal hyperostosis. They are also hypervascular, receiving their blood supply predominantly from dural vessels.\n【4】 Most meningiomas are isointense to brain on T1- and T2-weighted images. A heterogeneous internal texture is found in all but the smallest meningiomas. The mottled pattern is likely due to a combination of flow void from vascularity, focal calcification, small cystic foci, and entrapped CSF spaces. Hemorrhage is not a common feature. An interface between the brain and lesion is often present, representing a CSF cleft, a vascular rim, or a dural margin. MR has special advantages over CT in assessing cavernous sinus involvement and arterial encasement. Meningiomas show intense enhancement with gadolinium and are sharply circumscribed. They have a characteristic broad base of attachment against a dural surface. Contrast scans are especially helpful for imaging the en plaque meningiomas that occur at the skull base.\n【5】 ## Nerve Sheath Tumors\n【6】 Schwannomas in the parasellar region arise from the trigeminal nerve and rarely from the 3rd, 4th, and 6th cranial nerves. The cisternal, cavernous, or extracranial components of the nerves can be involved. They are well-encapsulated, benign tumors, and their more or less globular shape distinguishes them from the broad-based meningiomas. Schwannomas are isointense on T1 and mildly hyperintense on T2-weighted images. Cystic components may be present, and occasional hemorrhage and calcification can further contribute to a heterogeneous appearance. The solid portions of theses tumors enhance brightly with intravenous contrast. Endnote\n【7】 ## Skull Base Tumors\n【8】 Primary, secondary, and metastatic tumors of the skull base can involve the parasellar region. The primary tumors include chordoma, chondroma, chondrosarcoma, and plasmacytoma. Secondary tumors are most often carcinomas from the nasopharynx and paranasal sinuses. The common metastases are from lung, breast, and prostatic carcinoma, but other tumors can also metastasize to the skull.\n【9】 Chordoma is a rare neoplasm, but it is the most common primary of the clivus. They arise from notochordal remnants in the clivus, meninges along the prepontine cistern, sphenoid or nasopharynx. The most common site is near the spheno-occipital synchondrosis. Chordomas are slow-growing and erode bone by direct extension. The soft tissue mass readily extends into the sella, perisellar, prepontine cistern, sphenoid sinus and middle fossa. Cartilaginous foci, bone fragments and calcifications are interspersed within the tumor matrix. Chondroma is a benign tumor that arises from cartilage cell rests at the skull base.\n【10】 Chondrosarcoma is the malignant counterpart that often originates from a preexisting benign lesion. Calcification is common in both tumors. Plasmacytoma is another rare tumor of the skull base that is derived from plasma cells. With time, many evolve to multiple myeloma.\n【11】 Chordomas and chondrosarcomas can be difficult to identify on T1-weighted axial images alone due to low contrast with the adjacent cortical bone and CSF, but alteration of the normal high signal clival fat is a sensitive indicator of disease. Plasmacytoma also has no distinctive MR features to allow for a definitive diagnosis. Enhancement with gadolinium is helpful to assess the intracranial components of these tumors.\n【12】 ## Vascular Lesions\n【13】 ### Aneurysm\n【14】 Aneurysms in the perisellar area arise from the circle of Willis or the intracavernous carotid arteries. A distinctly heterogeneous internal texture on MR images is due to flow effects and thrombus formation. Low signal intensity is caused by high flow and chronic hemorrhage; high signal may represent slow flow or subacute hemorrhage. Flow within the patent lumen may also cause a band of artifact in the phase-encoding direction on spin-echo images. Pneumatization of the anterior clinoid or calcification can simulate the flow void of an aneurysm. MR angiography is helpful to confirm the diagnosis of aneurysm.\n【15】 ### Carotid-Cavernous Fistula\n【16】 The fistulous connection may be directly between the cavernous carotid artery and the cavernous sinus or may be the result of a dural arteriovenous malformation in the parasellar region. Arterial pressures cause expansion of the cavernous sinus and dilatation of parasellar and orbital veins. Patients present with proptosis, chemosis, and visual loss. The presence of flow effects and flow artifacts confirms the diagnosis on MR images.\n【17】 ## Inflammation\n【18】 ### Tolosa-Hunt syndrome\n【19】 Patients present with painful ophthalmoplegia and visual deficits. Similar to orbital pseudotumor pathologically, Tolosa-Hunt syndrome is also characterized by occasional spontaneous remission, recurrent attacks, and prompt response to steroids. The granulomatous inflammation can lead to cavernous sinus thrombosis and secondary arteritis of the cavernous carotid artery. MRI reveals enlargement of the cavernous sinus and enhancement of the inflammatory tissue. Endnote\n【20】 ### Sphenoid sinus infections\n【21】 Inflammatory and infectious diseases of the sphenoid sinus can secondarily involve the sella and parasellar regions. Pyogenic and fungal infections can extend through the thin bone at the skull base to produce an epidural abscess. Extension into the cavernous sinus can lead to cranial nerve palsies, cavernous sinus thrombosis and carotid artery occlusion. Some of the fungal infections, such as aspergillosis and mucormycosis, are particularly aggressive and have a propensity to extend along vascular structures, leading to cerebral infarction and abscess formation. The combination of sphenoid sinus and intracranial involvement on plain and contrast-enhanced scans is the key to making the diagnosis.\n【22】 # Suprasellar Pathology\n【23】 ## Craniopharyngioma\n【24】 Craniopharyngiomas originate from epithelial remnants of Rathke's pouch, usually at the junction of the infundibulum and the pituitary gland. They are benign slow-growing tumors composed of both solid epithelial tissue and cystic components. The cysts contain variable amounts of cholesterol, keratin, necrotic debris, proteinaceous fluid and hemorrhage. Calcification is present in 75 to 85% of cases.\n【25】 Craniopharyngiomas have a variable appearance on MR, depending on their solid or cystic nature and the specific cyst contents. The solid lesions are hypointense on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted images. The cysts also have a long T2, but if they have a high cholesterol content or methemoglobin, shortening of T1 results in high signal intensity on T1-weighted images. Other features of craniopharyngioma include truncation of the dorsum sellae and upward growth into the third ventricle. Calcification is not reliably detected with MR, a disadvantage for differential diagnosis. Endnote\n【26】 ## Rathke's Cleft Cyst\n【27】 These benign cysts arise from remnants of Rathke's cleft in the region of the pars intermedia. They are lined by a single layer of ciliated columnar or cuboidal epithelium, often containing goblet cells. Initially intrasellar, they enlarge and extend into the suprasellar region as they accumulate fluid, mucous, and cellular debris.\n【28】 Rathke's cleft cysts are smoothly marginated and well-defined lesions. The MR signal characteristics are variable, depending on the cyst contents. The cyst capsule may enhance, but the lack of nodular enhancement helps distinguish these lesions from craniopharyngiomas. Endnote\n【29】 ## Chiasmatic & Hypothalamic Gliomas\n【30】 Chiasmatic gliomas occur primarily in children and young adults. Patients with neurofibromatosis are particularly at risk for developing optic and chiasmatic gliomas. These tumors are usually low grade but have a propensity to infiltrate along the visual pathways. Hypothalamic gliomas tend to behave more aggressively and produce symptoms earlier. They present with hypothalamic syndromes, such as diabetes insipidus, inappropriate ADH secretion, Fröhlich's syndrome, or disturbances of temperature, appetite, or metabolism.\n【31】 Chiasmatic gliomas are usually isointense or slightly hypointense on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted images. Expansion of the chiasm and optic tracts is seen best on coronal images. The sagittal plane often provides a longitudinal view of the proximal optic nerves. Posterior extension to the lateral geniculate body and beyond into the optic radiations is displayed best on axial T2-weighted or gadolinium enhanced images. Endnote Cystic components may be present, and occasionally exophytic growth extends into the suprasellar and interpeduncular cisterns.\n【32】 MR is especially good for detecting and delineating hypothalamic gliomas. Subtle deformity of the inferior recesses of the third ventricle can be visualized on coronal and sagittal views. These tumors have a tendency to infiltrate the adjacent thalamus and upper brain stem. Signal characteristics are similar to the chiasmatic gliomas, and they may also exhibit exophytic features. As a rule, both tumors enhance to a moderate degree and in a homogeneous fashion, except for the cystic portions.\n【33】 ## Hamartoma of the Tuber Cinereum\n【34】 These benign tumors consist of hyperplastic hypothalamic glial and neural tissue. Patients present with precocious puberty due to disruption of the normal hypothalamic inhibition of gonadotropin production during the prepuberty years. These lesions grow very slowly and often appear unchanged on serial imaging studies.\n【35】 Hamartomas are sessile or pedunculated masses positioned between the infundibulum and mamillary bodies. They are usually isointense to brain on T1-weighted images and mildly hyperintense on T2-weighted images. The lack of contrast enhancement distinguishes these tumors from hypothalamic glioma and germinoma. Endnote\n【36】 ## Lymphoma\n【37】 Primary malignant lymphoma is a non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that occurs in the brain in the absence of systemic involvement. These tumors are highly cellular and grow rapidly. The hypothalamus and cavernous sinuses are favorite sites in the perisellar region. Most occur in patients who are immunocompromised secondary to chemotherapy, HIV infection, or in organ transplant recipients who are on immunosuppressant drugs. Lymphomas typically appear as homogeneous, slightly hyperintense masses on T2-weighted images. Intratumoral cysts, hemorrhage, or necrosis are unusual. Most lymphomas show bright homogeneous contrast enhancement.\n【38】 ## Germinoma\n【39】 This germ cell tumor occurs in children and young adults, most commonly in the pineal and suprasellar regions. Germinomas have a propensity to invade the hypothalamus and grow into the third ventricle, resulting in endocrine dysfunction. Dissemination through the CSF pathways is a known complication of germinoma.\n【40】 Germinomas are most often isointense with the brain on T1- and T2-weighted images. A few lesions exhibit long T1 and T2, which may correlate with embryonal cell elements. These tumors are well defined and enhance to a moderate degree, usually without central necrosis, cystic change, or hemorrhage. Enhanced scans are essential to assess CSF spread of tumor. In young patients with germinoma, the difficulty of visualizing calcium is a disadvantage of MR, as this may be the only evidence of tumor.\n【41】 ## Arachnoid Cyst, Epidermoid, Dermoid\n【42】 ### Arachnoid cyst\n【43】 Arachnoid cysts are CSF-containing cysts that are found in the middle fossa, posterior fossa, suprasellar cistern, or near the vertex. They are benign but slowly grow as they accumulate fluid, compressing normal brain structures. Arachnoid cysts are smoothly marginated and homogeneous. They are not calcified and do not enhance. The diagnosis is supported by the cyst fluid being isointense with CSF on all pulse sequences. Endnote\n【44】 ### Epidermoid cyst\n【45】 Epidermoid cysts are referred to as \"pearly tumors\" because of their glistening white appearance at surgery. They arise from epithelial cell rests in the basal cisterns. They are benign and grow slowly along the subarachnoid spaces and into the various crevices found at the base of the brain.\n【46】 Intradural epidermoids are usually quite large with lobulated outer margins and an insinuating pattern of growth. They have a heterogeneous texture and variable signal intensity on MR. Endnote Most are slightly higher signal than CSF on both T1 and T2-weighted images. An occasional epidermoid has a very short T1 and appears bright on T1-weighted images. The heterogeneous signal pattern is likely related to varying concentrations of keratin, cholesterol, and water within the cyst, as well as the proportion of cholesterol and keratin in crystalline form. Calcification is sometimes present. Epidermoid tumors do not enhance with contrast.\n【47】 ### Dermoid cyst\n【48】 Dermoid cysts have both dermal and epidermal derivatives, accounting for their more varied histologic and MR appearance. They are primarily midline lesions, occurring in the pineal and suprasellar regions. Dermoids have some distinctive features on MR. They tend to be heterogeneous owing to the multiple cell types within them. Fatty components are common, producing high signal on T1-weighted images. Axial and sagittal scans may reveal a fat-fluid level, or a level between fat and matted hair within the cyst. Rupture of a dermoid and leakage of cyst contents into a ventricle or subarachnoid space may produce an ependymitis or meningitis, respectively.\n【49】 ## Granulomatous Disease\n【50】 ### Langerhan's cell histiocytosis\n【51】 Formerly called histiocytosis X and eosinophilic granuloma, this disease is a multisystem disorder involving the skin, bones, orbit, lungs, and the CNS. Proliferation of histiocytes form granulomas in and around the hypothalamus and infundibulum. Diabetes insipidus is the most common presentation, but patients can also develop other endocrine dysfunctions or visual impairment. MRI typically shows a thickened infundibulum or a hypothalamic mass that is isointense on T1, hyperintense on T2-weighted images, and enhances with contrast material. The normal posterior pituitary bright spot is frequently absent. Endnote\n【52】 ### Sarcoid\n【53】 Sarcoidosis is a granulomatous disease of unknown etiology. In approximately 5% of cases, the CNS is involved as a granulomatous infiltration of the meninges and underlying parenchyma, most notably at the base of the brain. Cranial nerve palsies, chronic meningitis and hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction are frequent manifestations. Sarcoidosis is generally a multifocal process. MR is well suited to imaging the focal pituitary and hypothalamic lesions. The basal cisterns may enhance diffusely in patients with meningeal sarcoidosis, but a nodular pattern usually distinguishes it from the infectious varieties. Endnote\n【54】 ### Tuberculosis\n【55】 Tuberculous meningitis remains an important disease, becoming more common as an infectious agent in AIDS patients. As a rule, the evolution is less rapid than in pyogenic infections. Vasculitis and cerebral infarction, caused by inflammatory changes in the basal cisterns, are more prevalent. The MR features of tuberculous meningitis are similar to the bacterial agents, but the chronic inflammation induces thick granulation tissue that produces a more striking enhancement pattern. A basal meningeal process associated with lacunar infarcts should suggest the diagnosis of tuberculosis.\n【56】 # Image Gallery\n【57】 ## MRI\n【58】 (Images courtesy of RadsWiki)\n【59】 - Cavernous sinus aneurysm\n【60】 - Cavernous sinus aneurysm\n【61】 - Cavernous sinus aneurysm\n【62】 - Cavernous sinus aneurysm\n【63】 - Cavernous sinus aneurysm\n【64】 - Cavernous sinus aneurysm\n【65】 - Cavernous sinus aneurysm", "title": "Parasellar and suprasellar disorders", "tags": "", "lang": "", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"overview\": \"None\", \"source\": \"wikidoc\", \"url\": \"https://www.wikidoc.org/index.php/Glioma_of_third_ventricle\", \"id\": \"310803f71bb8729d09841fb9e1ec31a6bb8a106c\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"type3": "无关文本#56#61#内容无效"}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-01-28 23:07:59", "update_time": "2024-02-18 18:44:52"}

It means \"at right angles\". The word comes from the Greek Template:Polytonic (orthos), meaning \"straight\", and Template:Polytonic (gonia), meaning \"angle\". Two streets that cross each other at a right angle are orthogonal to one another. In recent years, \"perpendicular\" has come to be used more in relation to right angles outside of a coordinate plane context, whereas \"orthogonal\" is used when discussing vectors or coordinate geometry.\n【3】 # Explanation\n【4】 Formally, two vectors x and y in an inner product space V are orthogonal if their inner product \\langle x, y \\rangle is zero.  This situation is denoted x \\perp y.\n【5】 Two vector subspaces A and B of vector space V are called orthogonal subspaces if each vector in A is orthogonal to each vector in B.  The largest subspace that is orthogonal to a given subspace is its orthogonal complement.\n【6】 A linear transformation T : V \\rightarrow V is called an orthogonal linear transformation if it preserves the inner product.  That is, for all pairs of vectors x and y in the inner product space V,\n【7】 This means that T preserves the angle between x and y,\n【8】 and that the lengths of Tx and x are equal.\n【9】 A term rewriting system is said to be orthogonal if it is left-linear and is non-ambiguous. Orthogonal term rewriting systems are confluent.\n【10】 The word normal is sometimes also used in place of orthogonal.  However, normal can also refer to unit vectors.  In particular, orthonormal refers to a collection of vectors that are both orthogonal and normal (of unit length).  So, using the term normal to mean \"orthogonal\" is often avoided.\n【11】 # In Euclidean vector spaces\n【12】 In 2- or 3-dimensional Euclidean space, two vectors are orthogonal if their dot product is zero, i.e. they make an angle of 90° or π/2 radians. Hence orthogonality of vectors is a generalization of the concept of perpendicular. In terms of Euclidean subspaces, the orthogonal complement of a line is the plane perpendicular to it, and vice versa. Note however that there is no correspondence with regards to perpendicular planes, because vectors in subspaces start from the origin.\n【13】 In 4-dimensional Euclidean space, the orthogonal complement of a line is a hyperplane and vice versa, and that of a plane is a plane.\n【14】 Several vectors are called pairwise orthogonal if any two of them are orthogonal, and a set of such vectors is called an orthogonal set. Such a set is an orthonormal set if all its vectors are unit vectors. Non-zero pairwise orthogonal vectors are always linearly independent.\n【15】 # Orthogonal functions\n【16】 It is common to use the following inner product for two functions f and g:\n【17】 Here we introduce a nonnegative weight function w(x) in the definition of this inner product.\n【18】 We say that those functions are orthogonal if that inner product is zero:\n【19】 We write the norms with respect to this inner product and the weight function as\n【20】 The members of a sequence { fi : i = 1, 2, 3, ... } are:\n【21】 - orthogonal if\n【22】 - orthonormal\n【23】 where\n【24】 is the Kronecker delta.  In other words, any two of them are orthogonal, and the norm of each is 1 in the case of the orthonormal sequence.  See in particular orthogonal polynomials.\n【25】 # Examples\n【26】 - The vectors (1, 3, 2), (3, −1, 0), (1/3, 1, −5/3)  are orthogonal to each other, since (1)(3) + (3)(−1) + (2)(0) = 0, (3)(1/3) + (−1)(1) + (0)(−5/3) = 0, (1)(1/3) + (3)(1) − (2)(5/3) = 0. Observe also that the dot product of the vectors with themselves are the norms of those vectors, so to check for orthogonality, we need only check the dot product with every other vector.\n【27】 - The vectors (1, 0, 1, 0, ...)T and (0, 1, 0, 1, ...)T are orthogonal to each other. Clearly the dot product of these vectors is 0. We can then make the obvious generalization to consider the vectors in Z2n:\n【28】 - Take two quadratic functions 2t + 3 and 5t2 + t − 17/9. These functions are orthogonal with respect to a unit weight function on the interval from −1 to 1. The product of these two functions is 10t3 + 17t2 − 7/9 t − 17/3, and now,\n【29】 - The functions 1, sin(nx), cos(nx) : n = 1, 2, 3, ... are orthogonal with respect to Lebesgue measure on the interval from 0 to 2π.  This fact is basic in the theory of Fourier series.\n【30】 - Various eponymously named polynomial sequences are sequences of orthogonal polynomials.  In particular:\n【31】 The Hermite polynomials are orthogonal with respect to the normal distribution with expected value 0.\n【32】 The Legendre polynomials are orthogonal with respect to the uniform distribution on the interval from −1 to 1.\n【33】 The Laguerre polynomials are orthogonal with respect to the exponential distribution.  Somewhat more general Laguerre polynomial sequences are orthogonal with respect to gamma distributions.\n【34】 The Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind are orthogonal with respect to the measure 1/\\sqrt{1-x^2}.\n【35】 The Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind are orthogonal with respect to the Wigner semicircle distribution.\n【36】 - The Hermite polynomials are orthogonal with respect to the normal distribution with expected value 0.\n【37】 - The Legendre polynomials are orthogonal with respect to the uniform distribution on the interval from −1 to 1.\n【38】 - The Laguerre polynomials are orthogonal with respect to the exponential distribution.

This means, in Dirac notation, that  \\langle \\psi_m | \\psi_n \\rangle = 0  unless  \\psi_m  and  \\psi_n  correspond to the same eigenvalue. This follows from that Schrödinger's equation is a Sturm-Liouville equation (in Schrödinger's formulation) or that observables are given by hermitian operators (in Heisenberg's formulation).\n【42】 # Derived meanings\n【43】 Other meanings of the word orthogonal evolved from its earlier use in mathematics.\n【44】 ## Art\n【45】 In art the perspective imagined lines pointing to the  vanishing point are referred to as 'orthogonal lines'.\n【46】 ## Computer science\n【47】 Orthogonality is a system design property facilitating feasibility and compactness of complex designs.  Orthogonality guarantees that modifying the technical effect produced by a component of a system neither creates nor propagates side effects to other components of the system.  The emergent behavior of a system consisting of components should be controlled strictly by formal definitions of its logic and not by side effects resulting from poor integration, i.e. non-orthogonal design of modules and interfaces.  Orthogonality reduces testing and development time because it is easier to verify designs that neither cause side effects nor depend on them.\n【48】 For example, a car has orthogonal components and controls (e.g. accelerating the vehicle does not influence anything else but the components involved exclusively with the acceleration function). On the other hand, a non-orthogonal design might have its steering influence its braking (e.g. Electronic Stability Control), or its speed tweak its suspension.  Consequently, this usage is seen to be derived from the use of orthogonal in mathematics:  One may project a vector onto a subspace by projecting it onto each member of a set of basis vectors separately and adding the projections if and only if the basis vectors are mutually orthogonal.\n【49】 An instruction set is said to be orthogonal if any instruction can use any register in any addressing mode.  This terminology results from considering an instruction as a vector whose components are the instruction fields.  One field identifies the registers to be operated upon, and another specifies the addressing mode.  An orthogonal instruction set uniquely encodes all combinations of registers and addressing modes.\n【50】 ## Radio communications\n【51】 In radio communications, multiple-access schemes are orthogonal when an ideal receiver can completely reject arbitrarily strong unwanted signals using different basis functions than the desired signal. One such scheme is TDMA, where the orthogonal basis functions are non-overlapping rectangular pulses (\"time slots\").\n【52】 Another scheme is orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM), which refers to the use, by a single transmitter, of a set of frequency multiplexed signals with the exact minimum frequency spacing needed to make them orthogonal so that they do not interfere with each other.  Well known examples include (a and g) versions of 802.11 Wi-Fi; Wimax; DVB-T, the terrestrial digital TV broadcast system used in most of the world outside North America; and DMT, the standard form of ADSL.\n【53】 ## Statistics, econometrics, and economics\n【54】 When performing statistical analysis, variables that affect a particular result are said to be orthogonal if they are uncorrelated.  That is to say that by varying each separately, one can predict the combined effect of varying them jointly. If correlation is present, the factors are not orthogonal.  In addition, orthogonality  restrictions are necessary for inference.  This meaning of orthogonality derives from the mathematical one, because orthogonal vectors are linearly independent.\n【55】 ## Taxonomy\n【56】 In taxonomy, an orthogonal classification is one in which no item is a member of more than one group, that is, the classifications are mutually exclusive.\n【57】 ## Combinatorics\n【58】 In combinatorics, two n×n Latin squares are said to be orthogonal if their superimposition yields all possible n2 combinations of entries.\n【59】 ## Chemistry\n【60】 In chemistry orthogonal protection is a strategy allowing the deprotection of functional groups independently of each other.", "title": "Orthogonality", "tags": "", "lang": "", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"https://www.wikidoc.org/index.php/Orthogonal\", \"source\": \"wikidoc\", \"overview\": \"None\", \"id\": \"5060be4eb0dbbf75491c2362c3c0f082241c7d3f\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"type2": "术语格式错误#27#27#转置格式错误\n术语格式错误#28#28#幂函数及除法格式错误\n术语格式错误#34#34#幂函数格式错误\n术语格式错误#39#39#幂函数格式错误\n\n\n"}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-01-28 23:07:59", "update_time": "2024-01-28 23:55:16"}

This report summarizes provisional 2008 data from the National TB Surveillance System and describes trends since 1993. Despite this overall improvement, progress has slowed in recent years; the average annual percentage decline in the TB rate decreased from 7.3% per year during 1993-2000 to 3.8% during 2000-2008.- Foreign-born persons and racial/ethnic minorities continued to bear a disproportionate burden of TB disease in the United States. In 2008, the TB rate in foreignborn persons in the United States was 10 times higher than in U.S.-born persons. TB rates among Hispanics and blacks were nearly eight times higher than among non-Hispanic whites, and rates among Asians were nearly 23 times higher than among non-Hispanic whites. In 2008, among persons with TB whose country of origin was known, approximately 95% of Asians, 76% of Hispanics, 32% of blacks, and 18% of#\n【1】 whites were foreign born. Among U.S.-born racial and ethnic groups, the greatest racial disparity in TB rates was for U.S.born blacks, whose rate was seven times higher than the rate for U.S.-born whites. Intensified efforts are needed to address the slowing decline in TB incidence and the persistent disparities that exist between U.S.-born and foreign-born persons and between whites and minorities in the United States.\n【2】 Health departments in the 50 states and the District of Columbia (DC) electronically report to CDC verified TB cases that meet the CDC/Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists case definition. † Reports include the patient's race, ethnicity (i.e., Hispanic or non-Hispanic), treatment information, and, whenever available, drug-susceptibility test results. CDC calculates national and state TB rates overall and by racial/ethnic group using current U.S. Census population estimates. U.S. Census annual estimates were used to calculate the national TB rate and the percentage change from 2007 to 2008. Population denominators used to calculate TB rates and percentage changes over time according to national origin (U.S.-born versus foreign-born persons) were from the U.S. Census Current Population Survey. A U.S.-born person was defined as someone born in the United States or its associated jurisdictions or someone born in a foreign country but having at least one U.S.-born parent. Persons not meeting this definition were classified as foreign born. For 2008, patients with unknown origin of birth represented 0.6% (74 of 12,898) of total cases. For this report, persons identified as white, black, Asian, American Indian/Alaska Native, native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, or of multiple races were all classified as non-Hispanic. Persons identified as Hispanic might be of any race.\n【3】 In 2008, TB rates in the 51 reporting areas ranged from 0.5 (North Dakota) to 9.6 (Hawaii) cases per 100,000 population (median: 3.0 cases per 100,000 population) (Figure 1). Thirtythree states and DC had lower rates in 2008 than in 2007; however, 17 states had higher rates. Four states (California, Florida, New York, and Texas) reported more than 500 cases each for 2008, a decline from seven states with at least 500 cases in 2006 and five states in 2007. Combined, these four states accounted for approximately half (49.2% ) of all TB cases in 2008.\n【4】 Among U.S.-born persons, the number and rate of TB cases continued to decline in 2008. The number of TB cases in U.S.-born persons (5,283 ) declined 3.9% compared with 2007 and 69.7% compared with 1993 (Figure 2). In 2008, the TB rate among U.S.-born persons was 2.0 per 100,000 population, § TB rate cutoff points were based on terciles: 18 states had TB case rates of 4.0 (range: 4.02-9.63) per 100,000. DC 4.0 § Editorial Note: In 2008, the number of TB cases and annual TB rate reached all-time lows in the United States. After the resurgence of TB during 1985-1992, the annual TB rate has steadily decreased. However, since 2000, the pace of that decline has slowed. To hasten the decline of TB in the United States, intensified efforts are required to address the disproportionately high rates of TB that persist among foreign-born persons and racial/ethnic minorities. The proportion of TB cases contributed by foreign-born persons has increased each year since 1993. This is a reflection of high rates of TB in countries of origin for U.S. immigrants. To help address this, in 2007, CDC issued revised technical instructions for TB screening and treatment among persons applying for immigration to the United States (3). The revision included instructions for 1) more comprehensive diagnostic testing among applicants (e.g., cultures and drug-susceptibility testing for persons with suspected TB); 2) the administration of directly observed therapy overseas, before entry into the United States; and 3) targeted tuberculin skin testing (before entry into the United States) of children from high-incidence countries and contacts of persons known to have TB. In addition, CDC continues to work with international partners, including the Stop TB Partnership, to strengthen TB control in countries with high TB incidence. For example, to facilitate patient referral and treatment among persons who cross the U.S.-Mexico border, bilateral initiatives (e.g., CureTB) are improving coordination of TB care between U.S. TB programs and Mexican counterparts. Modeling has suggested that U.S.-funded expansion of the directly observed treatment (short course) strategy in selected high-incidence countries (e.g., Mexico) might be a cost-saving approach to reducing TB-related morbidity and mortality among U.S. immigrants (4).\n【5】 The proportion of TB cases that are multidrug resistant has remained approximately 1% of culture-positive cases since 1997; however, MDR TB has continued to disproportionately affect foreign-born persons in the United States. CDC continues to provide technical assistance to domestic and international partners to increase detection of MDR TB and improve access to second-line TB drugs (5).   In 2008, TB rates declined for all racial/ethnic minorities, yet among the U.S. born, blacks continue to experience a disproportionately high rate of TB. CDC's TB Epidemiologic Studies Consortium currently is conducting studies to understand how to reduce TB in blacks effectively, including a study to identify barriers to treatment adherence for latent TB infection and TB disease and a study examining the determinants of early diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of TB.\n【6】 The findings in this report are subject to at least two limitations. First, the analysis was based on provisional 2008 data that are subject to change. This applies to TB case counts and HIV testing results data, both of which were incomplete. Additional data might change the results marginally. Second, population denominator data were drawn from multiple U.S. census sources and are subject to periodic adjustment. CDC's annual TB surveillance summary, due to be published in fall 2009, will provide updated data.\n【7】 To ensure that TB rates decline further in the United States, especially among foreign-born persons and minority populations, TB prevention and control capacity should be increased (6)(7)(8). Additional capacity should be used to 1) improve case management and contact investigations; 2) intensify outreach, testing, and treatment of high-risk and hard-to-reach populations; 3) enhance treatment and diagnostic tools; 4) increase scientific research to better understand TB transmission; and 5) continue collaboration with other nations to reduce TB globally. FSM comprises four states and more than 600 islands spread across 1 million square miles in the western Pacific Ocean. Half of the population of 108,000 lives in Chuuk, the largest state (2). TB is endemic in Chuuk, where 70 cases of TB were recorded in 2007. The 2007 incidence rate (127 TB cases per 100,000) is 29 times higher than the 2007 U.S. rate (3).\n【8】 # Two Simultaneous\n【9】 # Limited transportation hinders access to the only hospital in\n【10】 Chuuk, which provides chest radiography and smear microscopy services to help diagnose TB. Culture confirmation, drug-susceptibility testing, and genotyping were not available routinely for TB cases in FSM until January 2006, when referral laboratories in Hawaii and California began to offer these services. Before 2008, the state's geography, combined with limited TB program staffing, precluded active case-finding via routine contact investigations or the administration of DOT, a cornerstone of TB treatment that improves completion of therapy and prevents the emergence of drug resistance. Before July 2008, TB patients were identified as they showed signs or symptoms of TB disease at the local clinic or hospital; all received self-administered therapy. FSM's National TB Program has an annual budget of $170,000, and second-line drugs for treating MDR TB were not available because of funding constraints.\n【11】 In June 2007, pulmonary TB was diagnosed in a Chuuk resident aged 37 years. Sputum-smear microscopy detected acid-fast bacilli, and a chest radiograph showed lung cavitation, both indicators of contagiousness. In November 2007, drug-susceptibility test results confirmed multidrug resistance. The patient did not have access to second-line drugs and died. During December 2007-June 2008, four additional patients with MDR TB disease came to the local clinic or hospital. None of the four patients were treated with second-line drugs; three died, including a child aged 2 years. In May 2008, FSM authorities requested CDC assistance because of the 80% fatality rate and evidence of recent MDR TB transmission.\n【12】 A confirmed case was defined as laboratory-confirmed MDR TB disease in a Chuuk resident during January 2006-June 2008. A suspected case of MDR TB disease was defined as exposure (based on intensity and duration of contact) to a patient with confirmed TB and clinical findings of TB disease (i.e., laboratory confirmation pending). Patients (or proxies for deceased patients) were interviewed and laboratory and medical records reviewed.\n【13】 The July 2008 investigation focused on the initial five confirmed MDR TB cases. All patients were born in Chuuk; their median age was 16 years (range: 2-37 years), and four were female. None of the patients had a history of TB disease or treatment with TB drugs. All five patients had pulmonary TB, two with cavitation on chest radiograph and hemoptysis. None of the four patients who died before the investigation had been tested for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection; the surviving patient had a negative HIV test result in July 2008. Two distinct clusters, associated with two different villages, were identified based on genotypes and drug-susceptibility patterns (Figure).\n【14】 In the first cluster of three cases, Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates had a matching genotype and resistance to five drugs: isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, and streptomycin. This drug-susceptibility pattern had not been seen in Chuuk since routine drug-susceptibility testing became available in January 2006. The index patient in this cluster had worked during 1987-2000 in the garment industry in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (Saipan), which employs migrants from Southeast Asian countries (4) where MDR TB is common (5).\n【15】 In the second cluster of two cases, the isolates had a matching genotype and resistance to three drugs: isoniazid, rifampin, and ethionamide. The two patients were cousins whose extended family included five persons who previously had TB disease with isolates genotypically matched to those of the outbreak patients. However, the earlier isolates had resistance to isoniazid and ethionamide only. These five previous cases of non-MDR TB were diagnosed from January 2006, when genotyping became routinely available in Chuuk, to October 2007. Household caregivers reported that the five patients had self-administered therapy inconsistently or incompletely.\n【16】 During investigations of the five initial cases of MDR TB disease, a standardized clinical examination, chest radiography, and tuberculin skin testing were used to evaluate contacts for TB disease and latent TB infection (6). The 205 named contacts, of whom 163 (80%) were household members and 42 (20%) were health-care workers, had a median age of 20 years (range: 4 months-62 years), and 117 (57%) were female. During July 1, 2008-March 13, 2009, three additional MDR TB cases were confirmed among household members (Figure ), including a household contact aged 4 years who in November 2008 died of meningitis later confirmed to be caused by MDR TB. Based on history of household exposure to a patient with confirmed TB and clinical findings (e.g., chest radiography consistent with TB disease), 13 other suspected cases of MDR TB disease were identified; all 13 patients began treatment based on the drug-susceptibility results of the respective source case (Table ). Although fewer than one third of the contacts were aged <15 years (60 of 205), they accounted for more than half of the suspected and confirmed MDR TB cases since July 2008 (nine of 16). Latent TB infection was diagnosed in 124 (60%) contacts, although many of the adults were probably infected before this documented emergence of MDR TB in Chuuk. Among contacts aged <15 years, 20 (33%) of 60 had latent TB infection. All household contacts with latent TB infection have begun receiving second-line drugs based on the drug-susceptibility results of the respective source case (1,7).\n【17】 Multiple  (9) have resulted in the following actions: 1) a consistent supply of fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, and other second-line drugs was procured; 2) Chuuk State Hospital added a separate ward for inpatient treatment of patients with TB; 3) TB program staff members received on-site training on providing DOT and conducting contact investigations; 4) nine new outreach workers were hired to administer DOT, and three vehicles were acquired to help workers investigate contacts; 5) the hospital laboratory was equipped for processing specimens for smear microscopy daily and shipping specimens for culture and drug-susceptibility testing weekly. For 2008, the improved case-detection capacity increased the recorded TB incidence to 204 cases per 100,000 persons. The Chuuk TB program is consulting with U.S. MDR TB experts by telephone and e-mail for assistance with complex treatment decisions, and implementing measures to prevent the selection of drug-resistant strains and reduce all TB transmission. Editorial Note: These two clusters of MDR TB represent two distinct outbreaks and illustrate two mechanisms for the emergence of drug resistance. In the first outbreak, the index patient had not been treated previously for TB and probably became infected with a MDR TB strain before returning to Chuuk in 2000 from Saipan; this case illustrates primary (i.e., initial) drug resistance. In the second outbreak, lack of DOT for the five family members with TB disease initially resistant to only isoniazid and ethionamide probably led to secondary (i.e., acquired) rifampin resistance. At least one of these five previous patients thus acquired multidrug resistance and transmitted MDR TB to the index case in the second outbreak.\n【18】 The emergence and transmission of MDR TB in these outbreaks were caused by the inability to follow standard TB control practices or to provide appropriate drugs. The findings also highlight the vulnerability of pediatric contacts and the challenges of diagnosing and treating MDR TB in resource-limited settings. Laboratory capacity and access to second-line TB drugs are fundamental to controlling MDR TB (1), and finding and curing all persons with TB is critical for interrupting transmission (8). Contact investigations enable active case-finding and early identification of recently infected contacts at highest risk for developing TB disease. Infection control practices (e.g., isolating contagious patients initially during treatment and wearing appropriate personal protective equipment) can prevent transmission of susceptible and drug-resistant TB, and are particularly important in congregate settings such as clinics, hospitals, and prisons. Uniform DOT for patients with TB disease prevents acquired drug resistance (5) and, where feasible, DOT should be offered for contacts with latent TB infection as well.\n【19】 The measures implemented in response to the MDR TB outbreaks in Chuuk have reflected all five aspects of the WHO global response plan for drug-resistant TB (10), which calls for augmenting the public health infrastructure to control TB, strengthening laboratory services for early diagnosis, improving surveillance to better understand drug resistance, implementing infection control to prevent transmission, and enhancing management of drug-resistant TB cases to reach the Global Plan to Stop TB 2006-2015 goals. † Tangible progress in treating and preventing the spread of TB has been made in Chuuk as recommendations from the investigation have been implemented.\n【20】 In 2008, an estimated 500,000 persons in the world developed MDR TB, largely as a result of inadequate TB control activities (5). In many countries where TB is endemic, ongoing transmission of multiple strains of MDR TB probably will be discovered as access to laboratory services improves (10). The challenge of primary drug resistance is likely to be exacerbated further by the increasing numbers of migratory and displaced populations (4). Many developing countries provide free firstline TB drugs through TB control programs. However, effective and sustainable mechanisms for access to expensive second-line TB drugs are needed for timely treatment of patients with drug-resistant TB. The multiagency response to the MDR TB outbreaks in Chuuk is a good example of the coordinated efforts that are needed to control MDR TB in many developing countries. As in Chuuk, a concerted focus on improving access to enhanced laboratory services and second-line TB drugs, and building local capacity for finding, diagnosing, and curing all forms of TB is necessary to address the global threat of MDR TB.\n【21】 # Guidance for Control of Infections with Carbapenem-Resistant or Carbapenemase-Producing Enterobacteriaceae in Acute Care Facilities\n【22】 Infection with carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) or carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae is emerging as an important challenge in health-care settings (1). Currently, carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) is the species of CRE most commonly encountered in the United States. CRKP is resistant to almost all available antimicrobial agents, and infections with CRKP have been associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality, particularly among persons with prolonged hospitalization and those who are critically ill and exposed to invasive devices (e.g., ventilators or central venous catheters). This report provides updated recommendations from CDC and the Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC) for the control of CRE or carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae in acute care (inpatient) facilities. For all acute care facilities, CDC and HICPAC recommend an aggressive infection control strategy, including managing all patients with CRE using contact precautions and implementing Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for detection of carbapenemase production. In areas where CRE are not endemic, acute care facilities should 1) review microbiology records for the preceding 6-12 months to determine whether CRE have been recovered at the facility, 2) if the review finds previously unrecognized CRE, perform a point prevalence culture survey in high-risk units to look for other cases of CRE, and 3) perform active surveillance cultures of patients with epidemiologic links to persons from whom CRE have been recovered. In areas where CRE are endemic, an increased likelihood exists for imporation of CRE, and facilities should consider additional strategies to reduce rates of CRE (2). Acute care facilities should review these recommendations and implement appropriate strategies to limit the spread of these pathogens.\n【23】 For CRKP, the most important mechanism of resistance is the production of a carbapenemase enzyme, bla kpc . The gene that encodes the bla kpc enzyme is carried on a mobile piece of genetic material (transposon), which increases the risk for dissemination. Since first described in North Carolina in 1999, CRKP has been identified in 24 states and is recovered routinely in certain hospitals in New York and New Jersey (3). Analysis of 2007 data regarding health-care-associated infections reported to CDC indicated that 8% of all Klebsiella isolates were CRKP, compared with fewer than 1% in 2000 (CDC, unpublished data, 2008). CRKP poses significant treatment challenges, and CRKP infections have been associated with increased mortality, length of stay, and increased cost (4). The emergence and spread of CRKP and other types of CRE is another in a series of worrisome public health developments regarding antimicrobial resistance among gram-negative bacteria and underscores the immediate need for aggressive detection and control strategies (5).\n【24】 A difficulty in detecting CRE is the fact that some strains that harbor bla kpc have minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) that are elevated but still within the susceptible range for carbapenems. Because these strains are susceptible to carbapenems, they are not identified as potential clinical or infection control risks using current susceptibility testing guidelines. To address this challenge, in January 2009, CLSI published a recommendation that carbapenem-susceptible Enterobacteriaceae with elevated MICs or reduced disk diffusion zone sizes be tested for the presence of carbapenemases using the modified Hodge test (MHT) (6). The MHT is a phenotypic test used to detect carbapenemases in isolates demonstrating elevated but susceptible carbapenem MICs and has demonstrated sensitivity and specificity exceeding 90% in identifying carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (6). If the MHT reveals the presence of a carbapenemase, CLSI recommends that a comment be added to the microbiology report to inform clinicians and infection preventionists. Because treatment information on MHT-positive, carbapenem-susceptible isolates is limited, CLSI guidelines do not recommend any changes regarding the reporting of susceptibility results themselves. Strains of Enterobacteriaceae that test intermediate or resistant to carbapenems should be reported as such and do not need to be subjected to the MHT.\n【25】 Patients with unrecognized CRKP colonization have served as reservoirs for transmission during health-care-associated outbreaks (7). For example, during an outbreak of 39 cases of CRKP infection in a hospital in Puerto Rico in 2008, in addition to a review of infection control practices, active surveillance cultures were performed on patients in the same units as persons with confirmed CRKP infection. Cultures performed on 30 patients in the intensive care unit revealed two colonized patients who were not previously known to harbor CRKP and were not placed in contact precautions (CDC, unpublished data, 2008). Control of the outbreak was hindered by lack of compliance with infection control practices. Health-care personnel adherence to recommendations for gown and glove use was low (62%) at the hospital, and appropriate hand hygiene (i.e., hand washing or using a waterless alcohol-based hand rub before and after patient contact) was observed in only 48% of patient encounters. The hospital eventually was able to control the outbreak through enhanced infection control compliance, patient cohorting, and weekly perirectal surveillance cultures of patients in the outbreak units until no new cases were identified.\n【26】 Experience from the outbreak in Puerto Rico and elsewhere (notably Israel) suggests that early detection through use of targeted surveillance and introduction of strict infection control measures (including reinforcement of hand hygiene and contact precautions) can help control the spread of CRKP (7). Other recent reports have demonstrated that microbiologic surveillance for CRKP can be accomplished using brothbased culture techniques that are widely available and also by in-house prepared molecular techniques and a commercial chromogenic agar (4,7-9); however, the latter two methods are not currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration. The screening tests used in several studies were performed on rectal or perirectal swabs; limited data indicate that surveillance screening of stool specimens, rectal swabs, or perirectal swabs might produce higher yield than testing of other body sites (e.g., nares or skin) (9).\n【27】 # CDC and HICPAC Recommendations\n【28】 In light of the clinical and infection control challenges posed by CRE and advances in the ability to detect these pathogens, CDC and HICPAC have developed new guidance for CRE infection prevention and control in an effort to limit the further emergence of these organisms (Box). These recommendations are based on strategies outlined in the 2006 HICPAC guidelines for management of multidrug-resistant organisms in health-care settings (2).\n【29】 All patients colonized or infected with CRE or carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae should be placed on contact precautions. Acute care facilities should establish a protocol, in conjunction with CLSI guidelines, to detect nonsusceptibility and carbapenemase production in Enterobacteriaceae, particularly Klebsiella spp. and Escherichia coli, and immediately alert epidemiology and infection control staff members if identified. All acute care facilities should review microbiology records for the preceding 6-12 months to ensure that previously unrecognized CRE cases have not occurred. If previously unrecognized cases are identified, facilities should conduct a point prevalence survey (a single round of active surveillance cultures) in units with patients at high risk (e.g., intensive care units, units where previous cases have been identified, and units where many patients are exposed to broad-spectrum antimicrobials) to identify any additional patients colonized with carbapenemresistant or carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella spp. and E. coli. The recommended surveillance culture methodology is aimed at detecting carbapenem resistance or carbapenemase production in Klebsiella spp. and E. coli only, because 1) this method facilitates performing the test in the microbiology laboratory without the use of molecular methods and 2) these organisms represent the majority of CRE encountered in the United States. When a case of hospital-associated CRE is identified, facilities should conduct a single round of active surveillance testing of patients with epidemiologic links to the CRE case (e.g., those patients in the same unit or patients who have been cared for by the same health-care personnel).\n【30】 The goal of active surveillance is to identify undetected carriers of carbapenem-resistant or carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella spp. and E. coli. Identification of other cases among patients with epidemiologic links to persons with confirmed infection suggests patient-to-patient transmission (7); in such instances, infection prevention measures should be vigorously reinforced, and surveillance cultures repeated periodically (e.g., weekly) until no new cases are identified. Situations where periodic point prevalence surveys repeatedly fail to identify other colonized patients suggest that infection control measures at the facility are effective in controlling transmission.\n【31】 In such instances, consideration should be given to halting active surveillance cultures in response to clinical cases and replacing them with periodic point prevalence surveys in units with patients at high risk to ensure that carbapenem-resistant or carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella spp. and E. coli do not reemerge.\n【32】 Because the prevalence of CRE is low in the majority of U.S. hospitals, routine microbiologic surveillance of persons admitted, such as that performed in some facilities to detect carriage of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, is not recommended. However, in some areas of the United States, notably New York City, CRE are routinely recovered, including from many patients who are admitted from the community. In these settings, point prevalence surveys in response to detected clinical cases might be less useful in controlling transmission of CRE. Facilities in regions where CRE are endemic should monitor clinical cases of CRE and implement the intensified (i.e., Tier 2) infection control strategies outlined in the 2006 HICPAC guidelines if rates of CRE are not decreasing (2). The challenges to hospitals of allocating additional resources to prevent and control CRE are balanced by the fact that an aggressive infection control strategy, such as that recommended in this report, offers an opportunity to limit the impact of these problematic pathogens while CRE prevalence remains low in most U.S. hospitals.\n【33】 # Infection Prevention and Control\n【34】 - All acute care facilities should implement contact precautions for patients colonized or infected with carbapenemresistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) or carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae. No recommendation can be made regarding when to discontinue contact precautions.\n【35】 # Laboratory\n【36】 - Clinical microbiology laboratories should follow Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines for susceptibility testing (1) and establish a protocol for detection of carbapenemase production (e.g., performance of the modified Hodge test).\n【37】 - Clinical microbiology laboratories should establish systems to ensure prompt notification of infection prevention staff of all Enterobacteriaceae isolates that are nonsusceptible to carbapenems or Klebsiella spp. or Escherichia coli isolates that test positive for a carbapenemase.\n【38】 # Surveillance\n【39】 - All acute care facilities should review clinical culture results for the preceding 6-12 months to determine whether previously unrecognized CRE have been present in the facility.\n【40】 -If this review identifies previously unrecognized CRE, a point prevalence survey (a single round of active surveillance cultures) should be performed to look for CRE in high-risk units (e.g., intensive care units, units where previous cases have been identified, and units where many patients are exposed to broad-spectrum antimicrobials).\n【41】 -If this review does not identify previously unrecognized CRE, monitoring for clinical infections should be continued.\n【42】 - If CRE or carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella spp. or E. coli are detected from one or more clinical cultures OR if the point prevalence survey reveals unrecognized colonization, the facility should investigate for possible transmission by:\n【43】 -Conducting active surveillance testing of patients with epidemiologic links to a patient with CRE infection (e.g., patients in the same unit or who have been cared for by the same health-care personnel).\n【44】  Continue active surveillance periodically (e.g., weekly) until no new cases of colonization or infection suggesting cross-transmission are identified.\n【45】  If transmission of CRE is not identified after repeated active surveillance testing, consider altering the surveillance strategy by performing periodic point prevalence surveys in high-risk units.\n【46】 -In areas where CRE are endemic, an increased likelihood exists for importation of CRE, and the procedures outlined might not be sufficient to prevent transmission. Facilities in such areas should monitor clinical cases and consider additional strategies to reduce rates of CRE as described in the 2006 Tier 2 guidelines for management of multidrug-resistant organisms in health-care settings (2). Recommendations for rate calculations have been described previously (3).\n【47】 # Notice to Readers\n【48】 # World Water Day -March 22, 2009\n【49】 Each year on March 22, World Water Day attracts international attention to the need to conserve and develop water resources. Shared Waters-Shared Opportunities, the theme for World Water Day 2009, focuses on issues associated with 263 lakes and river basins that cross the borders of two or more countries.\n【50】 Worldwide, nearly one third of those 263 water basins are shared by three or more countries, and 19 are shared by five or more countries (1). Despite the complexity of these boundaries, hundreds of successful international transboundary agreements have been negotiated. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, and other organizations are working to ensure the peaceful collaboration of countries who share water systems (1).\n【51】 Many countries lack resources to provide their inhabitants with safe drinking water and adequate sanitation. Approximately 880 million people still lack access to improved sources of drinking water (2), leaving them at risk for water-, sanitation-, and hygiene-related diseases. Worldwide, 1.6 million deaths per year result from unsafe water, poor sanitation, and lack of hygiene (3). Most of these deaths occur among children aged <5 years. The ongoing cholera epidemic in Zimbabwe (4), which has affected approximately 91,000 persons and caused more than 4,000 deaths (5) since it began in August 2008, is an example of the health risks of waterborne diseases, although most cases and fatalities resulting from waterborne diseases are never reported.\n【52】 # Notice to Readers\n【53】 # State Reportable Condition Assessment Results\n【54】 The Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) recently completed work on an assessment that captured information regarding which public health conditions were reportable by clinicians, laboratories, hospitals, or other public health reporters, as mandated by law or regulation in 50 U.S. states, four U.S. territories, and two autonomous reporting jurisdictions (New York City and the District of Columbia). A total of 255 conditions, including infectious conditions and noninfectious conditions (e.g., injuries, cancer, and workrelated conditions) were included in the assessment. Results for both the 2008 and 2007 assessments are available, using a web query tool, at / publichealthinformatics/statereportableconditionsqueryresults/tabid/261/default.aspx.\n【55】 Feedback concerning the 2008 assessment or the web query tool should be directed to CSTE via e-mail (ldwyer@cste.org). Subject matter experts at CDC or local or state health departments who are interested in helping CSTE develop requirements for the 2009 assessment may also notify CSTE at the same e-mail address.     † Calculated by summing the incidence counts for the current week, the 2 weeks preceding the current week, and the 2 weeks following the current week, for a total of 5 preceding years. Additional information is available at . § Not notifiable in all states. Data from states where the condition is not notifiable are excluded from this table, except starting in 2007 for the domestic arboviral diseases and influenza-associated pediatric mortality, and in 2003 for SARS-CoV. Reporting exceptions are available at . ¶ Includes both neuroinvasive and nonneuroinvasive. Updated weekly from reports to the Division of Vector-Borne Infectious Diseases, National Center for Zoonotic, Vector-Borne, and Enteric Diseases (ArboNET Surveillance). Data for West Nile virus are available in Table II.  The names of the reporting categories changed in 2008 as a result of revisions to the case definitions. Cases reported prior to 2008 were reported in the categories: Ehrlichiosis, human monocytic (analogous to E. chaffeensis); Ehrlichiosis, human granulocytic (analogous to Anaplasma phagocytophilum), and Ehrlichiosis, unspecified, or other agent (which included cases unable to be clearly placed in other categories, as well as possible cases of E. ewingii). † † Data for H. influenzae (all ages, all serotypes) are available in Table II. § § Updated monthly from reports to the Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention, National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention. Implementation of HIV reporting influences the number of cases reported. Updates of pediatric HIV data have been temporarily suspended until upgrading of the national HIV/AIDS surveillance data management system is completed.

Common adverse reactions include abdominal pain,  pseudomembranous colitis,  esophagitis,  nausea, vomiting, and  diarrhea.\n【5】 # Adult Indications and Dosage\n【6】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Adult)\n【7】 - ClindaMax® (Clindamycin Phosphate Gel) is indicated in the treatment of acne vulgaris. In view of the potential for diarrhea, bloody diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis, the physician should consider whether other agents are more appropriate.\n【8】 ## Off-Label Use and Dosage (Adult)\n【9】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\n【10】 There is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Clindamycin phosphate (gel) in adult patients.\n【11】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n【12】 There is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Clindamycin phosphate (gel) in adult patients.\n【13】 # Pediatric Indications and Dosage\n【14】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Pediatric)\n【15】 There is limited information regarding FDA-Labeled Use of Clindamycin phosphate (gel) in pediatric patients.\n【16】 ## Off-Label Use and Dosage (Pediatric)\n【17】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\n【18】 There is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Clindamycin phosphate (gel) in pediatric patients.\n【19】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n【20】 There is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Clindamycin phosphate (gel) in pediatric patients.\n【21】 # Contraindications\n【22】 - ClindaMax® (Clindamycin Phosphate Gel) is contraindicated in individuals with a history of hypersensitivity to preparations containing clindamycin or lincomycin, a history of regional enteritis or ulcerative colitis, or a history of antibiotic-associated colitis.\n【23】 # Warnings\n【24】 - Orally and parenterally administered clindamycin has been associated with severe colitis which may result in patient death. Use of the topical formulation of clindamycin results in absorption of the antibiotic from the skin surface. Diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, and colitis (including pseudomembranous colitis) have been reported with the use of topical and systemic clindamycin.\n【25】 - Studies indicate a toxin(s) produced by clostridia is one primary cause of antibiotic-associated colitis. The colitis is usually characterized by severe persistent diarrhea and severe abdominal cramps and may be associated with the passage of blood and mucus. Endoscopic examination may reveal pseudomembranous colitis. Stool cultures for Clostridium difficile and stool assay for C. difficile toxin may be helpful diagnostically.\n【26】 - When significant diarrhea occurs, the drug should be discontinued. Large bowel endoscopy should be considered to establish a definitive diagnosis in cases of severe diarrhea.\n【27】 - Antiperistaltic agents such as opiates and diphenoxylate with atropine may prolong and/or worsen the condition. Vancomycin has been found to be effective in the treatment of antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous colitis produced by Clostridium difficile. The usual adult dosage is 500 mg to 2 grams of vancomycin orally per day in three to four divided doses administered for 7 to 10 days. Cholestyramine or colestipol resins bind vancomycin in vitro. If both a resin and vancomycin are to be administered concurrently, it may be advisable to separate the time of administration of each drug.\n【28】 - Diarrhea, colitis, and pseudomembranous colitis have been observed to begin up to several weeks following cessation of oral and parenteral therapy with clindamycin.\n【29】 # Adverse Reactions\n【30】 ## Clinical Trials Experience\n【31】 - In 18 clinical studies of various formulations of Clindamycin Phosphate using placebo vehicle and/or active comparator drugs as controls, patients experienced a number of treatment emergent adverse dermatologic events.\n【32】 - Orally and parenterally administered clindamycin has been associated with severe colitis which may end fatally.\n【33】 - Cases of diarrhea, bloody diarrhea and colitis (including pseudomembranous colitis) have been reported as adverse reactions in patients treated with oral and parenteral formulations of clindamycin and rarely with topical clindamycin.\n【34】 - Abdominal pain and gastrointestinal disturbances as well as gram-negative folliculitis have also been reported in association with the use of topical formulations of clindamycin.\n【35】 ## Postmarketing Experience\n【36】 There is limited information regarding Postmarketing Experience of Clindamycin phosphate (gel) in the drug label.\n【37】 # Drug Interactions\n【38】 - Clindamycin has been shown to have neuromuscular blocking properties that may enhance the action of other neuromuscular blocking agents  Therefore it should be used with caution in patients receiving such agents.\n【39】 # Use in Specific Populations\n【40】 ### Pregnancy\n【41】 Pregnancy Category (FDA): B\n【42】 - Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and mice using subcutaneous and oral doses of clindamycin ranging from 100 to 600 mg/kg/day and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to clindamycin. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.\n【43】 Pregnancy Category (AUS):\n【44】 - Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) Pregnancy Category\n【45】 There is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Clindamycin phosphate (gel) in women who are pregnant.\n【46】 ### Labor and Delivery\n【47】 There is no FDA guidance on use of Clindamycin phosphate (gel) during labor and delivery.\n【48】 ### Nursing Mothers\n【49】 - It is not known whether clindamycin is excreted in human milk following use of clindamycin phosphate. However, orally and parenterally administered clindamycin has been reported to appear in breast milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\n【50】 ### Pediatric Use\n【51】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of Clindamycin phosphate (gel) with respect to pediatric patients.\n【52】 ### Geriatic Use\n【53】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of Clindamycin phosphate (gel) with respect to geriatric patients.\n【54】 ### Gender\n【55】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of Clindamycin phosphate (gel) with respect to specific gender populations.\n【56】 ### Race\n【57】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of Clindamycin phosphate (gel) with respect to specific racial populations.\n【58】 ### Renal Impairment\n【59】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of Clindamycin phosphate (gel) in patients with renal impairment.\n【60】 ### Hepatic Impairment\n【61】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of Clindamycin phosphate (gel) in patients with hepatic impairment.\n【62】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\n【63】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of Clindamycin phosphate (gel) in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n【64】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\n【65】 There is no FDA guidance one the use of Clindamycin phosphate (gel) in patients who are immunocompromised.\n【66】 # Administration and Monitoring\n【67】 ### Administration\n【68】 - Topical\n【69】 ### Monitoring\n【70】 There is limited information regarding Monitoring of Clindamycin phosphate (gel) in the drug label.\n【71】 # IV Compatibility\n【72】 There is limited information regarding IV Compatibility of Clindamycin phosphate (gel) in the drug label.\n【73】 # Overdosage\n【74】 Topically applied clindamycin topical solution can be absorbed in sufficient amounts to produce systemic effects.\n【75】 # Pharmacology\n【76】 ## Mechanism of Action\n【77】 - Clindamycin has a primarily bacteriostatic effect. It is a bacterial protein synthesis inhibitor by inhibiting ribosomal translocation, in a similar way to macrolides. It does so by binding to the 50S rRNA of the large bacterial ribosome subunit.\n【78】 - The structures of the complexes between several antibiotics (including clindamycin) and a Deinococcus radiodurans ribosome have been solved by X-ray crystallography by a team from the Max Planck Working Groups for Structural Molecular Biology, and published in the journal Nature.\n【79】 ## Structure\n【80】 ## Pharmacodynamics\n【81】 There is limited information regarding Pharmacodynamics of Clindamycin phosphate (gel) in the drug label.\n【82】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n【83】 Although clindamycin phosphate is inactive in vitro, rapid in vivo hydrolysis converts this compound to the antibacterially active clindamycin.\n【84】 Cross resistance has been demonstrated between clindamycin and lincomycin.\n【85】 Antagonism has been demonstrated between clindamycin and erythromycin.\n【86】 Following multiple topical applications of clindamycin phosphate at a concentration equivalent to 10 mg clindamycin per mL in an isopropyl alcohol and water solution, very low levels of clindamycin are present in the serum (0-3 ng/mL) and less than 0.2% of the dose is recovered in urine as clindamycin.\n【87】 Clindamycin activity has been demonstrated in comedones from acne patients. The mean concentration of antibiotic activity in extracted comedones after application of Clindamycin Phosphate Topical Solution for 4 weeks was 597 mcg/g of comedonal material (range 0 - 1490). Clindamycin in vitro inhibits all Propionibacterium acnes cultures tested (MICs 0.4 mcg/mL). Free fatty acids on the skin surface have been decreased from approximately 14% to 2% following application of clindamycin.\n【88】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\n【89】 There is limited information regarding Nonclinical Toxicology of Clindamycin phosphate (gel) in the drug label.\n【90】 # Clinical Studies\n【91】 There is limited information regarding Clinical Studies of Clindamycin phosphate (gel) in the drug label.\n【92】 # How Supplied\n【93】 - ClindaMax® Gel (Clindamycin Phosphate Gel USP, 1%) containing clindamycin phosphate equivalent to 10 mg clindamycin per gram is available in the following sizes:\n【94】 - 30 gram tube NDC 0462-0390-30                     60 gram tube NDC 0462-0390-60\n【95】 ## Storage\n【96】 - Store at controlled room temperature 15°-30°C (59°-86°F).

It is the primary antibody against A and B antigens on red blood cells. IgM is by far the physically largest antibody in the human circulatory system.\n【3】 # Structure and function\n【4】 IgM forms polymers where multiple immunoglobulins are covalently linked together with disulfide bonds, mostly as a pentamer but also as a hexamer. IgM has a molecular mass of approximately 900 kD (in its pentamer form). Because each monomer has two antigen binding sites, a pentameric IgM has 10 binding sites.  Typically, however, IgM cannot bind 10 antigens at the same time because the large size of most antigens hinders binding to nearby sites.\n【5】 The J chain is found in pentameric IgM but not in the hexameric form, perhaps due to space constraints in the hexameric complex.  Pentameric IgM can also be made in the absence of J chain.  At present, it is still uncertain what fraction of normal pentamer contains J chain, and to this extent it is also uncertain whether a J chain-containing pentamer contains one or more than one J chain.  \n【6】 Because IgM is a large molecule, it cannot diffuse well, and is found in the interstitium only in very low quantities. IgM is primarily found in serum; however, because of the J chain, it is also important as a secretory immunoglobulin.\n【7】 Due to its polymeric nature, IgM possesses high avidity, and is particularly effective at complement activation.\n【8】 # Expression\n【9】 In germline cells, the gene segment encoding the μ constant region of the heavy chain is positioned first among other constant region gene segments. For this reason, IgM is the first immunoglobulin expressed by mature B cells.\n【10】 It is also the first immunoglobulin expressed in the fetus (around 20 weeks) and also phylogenetically the earliest antibody to develop.\n【11】 # Clinical significance\n【12】 IgM antibodies appear early in the course of an infection and usually do not reappear after further exposure. IgM antibodies do not pass across the human placenta.\n【13】 These two biological properties of IgM make it useful in the diagnosis of infectious diseases. Demonstrating IgM antibodies in a patient's serum indicates recent infection, or in a neonate's serum indicates intrauterine infection (e.g. congenital rubella).\n【14】 # Other points\n【15】 IgM in normal serum is often found to bind to specific antigens, even in the absence of prior immunization.  For this reason IgM has sometimes been called a \"natural antibody\".  This phenomenon is probably due to the high avidity of IgM that allow it to bind detectably even to weakly cross-reacting antigens that are naturally occurring in nature.  For example the IgM antibodies that bind to the red blood cell A and B antigens might be formed in early life as a result of exposure to A- and B-like substances that are present on bacteria or perhaps also on plant materials.\n【16】 IgM antibodies are mainly responsible for the clumping (agglutination) of red blood cells if the recipient of a blood transfusion receives blood that is not compatible with their blood type.\n【17】 # Related chapters\n【18】 - Antibody\n【19】 - IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG\n【20】 # Resources\n【21】 - Immunoglobulin+M at the US National Library of Medicine Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)", "title": "Immunoglobulin M", "tags": "", "lang": "", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"id\": \"2019e168b5c466c4a643edfecc18c641f64da39c\", \"overview\": \"None\", \"url\": \"https://www.wikidoc.org/index.php/IgM\", \"source\": \"wikidoc\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"type3": "", "type4": "语义不连贯#17#20#内容与前面内容关联不大"}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-01-28 23:07:59", "update_time": "2024-02-18 18:26:53"}

Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) usually results from the rupture of small penetrating arteries in the brain near the bifurcation of affected arterioles.  It is thought that ICH may result in brain injury by decreasing blood flow into the area surrounding the clot and causing neuronal ischemia or by overexertion of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which may result in the breakdown of the blood brain barrier and edema. The two major causes of intracerebral hemorrhage include long-standing hypertension and cerebral amyloid angiopathy.\n【3】 Intracerebral hemorrhage is a medical emergency requiring urgent diagnosis and treatment. If left untreated, it may result in irreversible brain tissue damage. causing permanent neurological deficit and death. Hematoma expansion and early deterioration are common within the first few hours after onset. CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are both reasonable for initial evaluation. Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality throughout the world. However, the excellent medical care has a potent, direct impact on spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) morbidity and mortality. Prevention of intracerebral hemorrhage is mainly aimed at treatment and modifcation of risk factors which are directly associated with increased occurrence of intracerebral hemorrhage.\n【4】 # Classification\n【5】 Intracerebral hemorrhage is bleeding within the brain itself. This category includes:\n【6】 # Pathophysiology\n【7】 Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is bleeding directly into the brain tissue and usually results from rupture of small penetrating arteries in the brain. Degenerative changes in the vessel wall may be associated with advancing age, chronic HTN, diabetes, and other vascular risk factor and It usually occurs at or near the bifurcation of affected arterioles. The exact cause of brain damage following intracerebral hemorrhage is unknown. It is thought that ICH may result in brain injury by decreasing blood flow into the area surrounding the clot and causing neuronal ischemia or by overexertion of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which may result in the breakdown of the blood brain barrier and edema.\n【8】 # Causes\n【9】 The two major causes of intracerebral hemorrhage include long-standing hypertension and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Other causes of intracerebral hemorrhage include vascular malformations (arteriovenous malformations (AVMs)) aneurysms, drugs (cocaineamphetamines), and vasculitis.\n【10】 # Differential diagnosis\n【11】 Differential diagnosis of intracerebral hemorrhage may include ischemic stroke, SAH, TIA, acute hypertensive crisis, sentinel headache, sinusitis, hypoglycemia, cerebral venous thrombosis, spontaneous intracranial hypotension, and reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome. It is clinically difficult to distinguish ICH or subarchnoid hemorrhage (SAH) from an ischemic stroke. However, the symptoms like headache, nausea, vomiting, and depressed level of consciousness should raise the suspicion for a hemorrhagic event compared to ischemic stroke.\n【12】 # Epidemiology\n【13】 The overall incidence of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) ranges from 12 to 31 per 100,000 population. The incidence of intracerebral hemorrhage gets doubled every 10 years after age 35 every, but the prevalence and incidence does not vary by gender. The incidence of intracerebral hemorrhage is the highest in Asians.\n【14】 # Risk factors\n【15】 Common risk factors in the development of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) include hypertension, anticoagulation medication(warfarin), acquired or congenital coagulation factor disorder (such as vitamin K deficiency, liver disease, disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC), and  hemophilias), platelet abnormalities, embolic strokes, and Sickle Cell Anemia.\n【16】 # Natural history, Complications, and Prognosis\n【17】 Intracerebral hemorrhage is a medical emergency requiring urgent diagnosis and treatment. If left untreated, it may result in irreversible brain tissue damage. causing permanent neurological deficit and death. The most common complications following intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) include hematoma expansion, venous thromboembolism (VTE), pneumonia, apiration, respiratory failure/distress pulmonary embolism, sepsis, neurogenic pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and acute kidney injury.\n【18】 Despite aggressive and newer management strategies, the prognosis of patients with intracerebral hemorrhage is very poor. The main powerful predictor of 30-day mortality and morbidity in patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage is a volume of hemorrhage in combination with the initial Glasgow Coma Scale score (GCS).\n【19】 # Diagnosis\n【20】 ## Emergency diagnosis and assessment\n【21】 Intracerebral hemorrhage is a medical emergency, characterized by high morbidity and mortality, which should be promptly diagnosed and aggressively managed. Hematoma expansion and early deterioration are common within the first few hours after onset. CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are both reasonable for initial evaluation.\n【22】 ## History and Symptoms\n【23】 It is critical to obtain a detailed and focused history in patient with intracerebral hemorrhage. History of gradual onset of symptoms,Vomiting, hypertension, lipid disorders, smoking, antiplatlete/anticoagulation medication, or illicit drug use, dementia, liver, and chronic kidney disease may suggest intracerebral hemorrhage as one of the initial differential diagnosis..\n【24】 ## Physical examination\n【25】 Physical examination of patients with Intracerebral hemorrhage usually varies based on the location of the bleeding. Physical examination of patients with intracerebral hemorrhage should include vital signs check and assessment of level of consciousness (GCS) and the severity of the neurological defect (NIHSS).\n【26】 ## Laboratory findings\n【27】 Routine laboratory studies in patient with intracerebral hemorrhage should include complete blood count (CBC) with platelets,electrolytes, renal function, coagulation studies (prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and INR), toxicology screen, blood glucose level, and pregnancy test in women of childbearing age.\n【28】 ## Electrocardiogram\n【29】 Following intracerebral hemorrhage and secondary to catecholamines release following posterior hypothalamus hypoperfusion, the EKG changes may show changes which is a  reflection of left ventricular ischemia. Additionally, brainstem compression may result in ventricular arrhythmias.\n【30】 ## CT\n【31】 CT is very sensitive for identifying acute hemorrhage and is considered the gold standard.\n【32】 ## MRI\n【33】 MRI is better than CT for detection of acute and chronic hemorrhage. Therefore it should be the preferred test for accurate diagnosis of patients with suspected intracerebral hemorrhage.\n【34】 ## Other imaging findings\n【35】 Other imaging findings in diagnosis of intracerebral hemorrhage may include CT angiography (CTA), CT venography (CTV), MR angiography (MRA), MR venography (MRV), and ctheter angiogram.\n【36】 # Treatment\n【37】 ## Early assessment\n【38】 Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a medical emergency. Rapid diagnosis and management is crucial because early deterioration is common in the first few hours after ICH onset.\n【39】 ## Management\n【40】 Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality throughout the world. However, the excellent medical care has a potent, direct impact on spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) morbidity and mortality. The non-surgical management of intracerebral hemorrhage is mainly directed to hemostasis/coagulopathy management, blood pressure (BP) management, glucose/temperature/seizure management, and other medical complications and procedures, including management of intracranial pressure (ICP) and intraventricular hemorrhage.\n【41】 For AHA/ASA guidelines for the management of ICH, please click here\n【42】 ## Surgery\n【43】 The indications for surgery in patients with Intracerebral hemorrhage vary with the site of the bleed. Open craniotomy is the most widely studied surgical techniques in patients with supratentorial ICH. Recently, several studies have shown minimally invasive aspiration associated with better outcomes with less invasive approaches compared to standard craniotomies.\n【44】 ## Primary prevention\n【45】 Primary prevention of intracerebral hemorrhage is mainly aimed at treatment and modifcation of risk factors which are directly associated with increased occurrence of intracerebral hemorrhage.\n【46】 ## Secondary prevention\n【47】 Effective measures for the secondary prevention of intracerebral hemorrhage include life style modification, treatment of modifiable risk factors such as blood pressure control and anticoagulation medication avoidance, and enforcing the measures to prevent the complications.", "title": "Intracerebral hemorrhage", "tags": "", "lang": "", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"id\": \"0505a5d2b1ddde7713d809a1d1cc93c9c6547294\", \"source\": \"wikidoc\", \"url\": \"https://www.wikidoc.org/index.php/Intracerebral_hemorrhage_overview\", \"overview\": \"None\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-01-28 23:07:59", "update_time": "2024-02-18 22:37:55"}

Primary contributions come from:\n【2】 - Sources in the earth. These include sources in food and water, which are incorporated in the body, and in building materials and other products that incorporate those radioactive sources;\n【3】 - Sources from space, in the form of cosmic rays;\n【4】 - Sources in the atmosphere. One significant contribution comes from the radon gas that is released from the Earth's crust and subsequently decays into radioactive atoms that become attached to airborne dust and particulates. Another contribution arises from the radioactive atoms produced in the bombardment of atoms in the upper atmosphere by high-energy cosmic rays.\n【5】 About 15% of background radiation dose to the general public comes from medical X-rays and nuclear medicine applied directly to patients.\n【6】 About 3% of background radiation comes from other man-made sources such as:\n【7】 - Smoke detectors\n【8】 - Self-luminous dials and signs\n【9】 - Global radioactive contamination due to historical nuclear weapons testing\n【10】 - Nuclear power station or nuclear fuel reprocessing accidents (though these are rare)\n【11】 - Normal operation of facilities used for nuclear power and scientific research\n【12】 - Emissions from burning fossil fuels, such as power plants\n【13】 - Emissions from nuclear medicine facilities and patients\n【14】 - Emissions from the improper disposal or recycling of radioactive materials used in nuclear medicine\n【15】 Accidental exposure to man-made radioactive substances can result in radiation exposure that is many times that received from background sources, whether natural or man-made. Additionally, radiation therapy can cause relatively high levels of exposure. However, when it comes to background radiation, naturally occurring sources are responsible for the vast majority of radiation exposure.\n【16】 # Natural background radiation\n【17】 Natural background radiation comes from two primary sources: cosmic radiation and terrestrial sources. The worldwide average background dose for a human being is about 2.4 millisievert (mSv) per year. This exposure is mostly from cosmic radiation and natural isotopes in the Earth. This is far greater than human-caused background radiation exposure, which in the year 2000 amounted to an average of about 0.01 mSv per year from historical nuclear weapons testing, nuclear power accidents and nuclear industry operation combined, and is greater than the average exposure from medical tests, which ranges from 0.04 to 1 mSv per year. Older coal-fired power plants without effective fly ash capture are one of the largest sources of human-caused background radiation exposure.\n【18】 The level of natural background radiation varies depending on location, and in some areas the level is significantly higher than average. Such areas include Ramsar in Iran, Guarapari in Brazil, Kerala in India, and Yangjiang in China. In Ramsar a peak yearly dose of 260 mSv has been reported.\n【19】 ## Cosmic radiation\n【20】 The Earth, and all living things on it, are constantly bombarded by radiation from outer space. This radiation primarily consists of positively charged ions from protons to iron nuclei derived from the sun and from other sources outside our solar system. This radiation interacts with atoms in the atmosphere to create secondary radiation, including X-rays, muons, protons, alpha particles, pions, electrons, and neutrons. The immediate dose from cosmic radiation is largely from muons, neutrons, and electrons, and this dose varies in different parts of the world based largely on the geomagnetic field and altitude. This radiation is much more intense in the upper troposphere, around 10 km altitude, and is thus of particular concern for airline crews and frequent passengers, who spend many hours per year in this environment. Here, the radiation exposure is not primarily due to the cosmic ray interaction with the thin atmosphere, but with the dense fuselage of the aircraft, causing relatively high background radiation in the cabin while the aircraft is at high altitude. Similarly, cosmic ray interaction with spacecraft components produces secondary radiation that causes higher background exposure in astronauts than in humans on the surface of Earth. Astronauts in low orbits, such as in the International Space Station or the Space Shuttle, are at low risk because the magnetic field of the Earth shields out most cosmic rays. Outside low Earth orbit, as experienced by the Apollo astronauts who travelled to the Moon, this background radiation is much more intense, and represents a considerable obstacle to potential future long term human exploration of the moon or Mars.\n【21】 Cosmic rays also cause elemental transmutation in the atmosphere, in which secondary radiation generated by the cosmic rays combine with atomic nuclei in the atmosphere to generate different radioactive isotopes. Many so-called cosmogenic nuclides can be produced, but probably the most notable is carbon-14, which is produced by interactions with nitrogen atoms. These cosmogenic nuclides eventually reach the earth's surface and can be incorporated into living organisms. The production of these nuclides varies slightly with short-term variations in solar cosmic ray flux, but is considered practically constant over long scales of thousands to millions of years. The constant production, incorporation into organisms and relatively short half-life of carbon-14 are the principles used in radiocarbon dating of ancient biological materials such as wooden artifacts or human remains.\n【22】 ## Terrestrial sources\n【23】 Radioactive material is found throughout nature. It occurs naturally in the soil, rocks, water, air, and vegetation. The major radionuclides of concern for terrestrial radiation are common elements with low-abundance radioactive isotopes, like potassium and carbon, or rare but intensely radioactive elements like uranium, thorium, radium and radon. Most of these sources have been decreasing, due to radioactive decay since the formation of the Earth, because there is no significant amount currently transported to the Earth. Thus, the present activity on earth from uranium-238 is only half as much as it originally was because of its 4.5 billion year half-life, and potassium-40 (half life 1.25 billion years) is only at about 8% of original activity. The effects on humans of the actual diminishment (due to decay) of these isotopes is minimal however. This is because humans evolved too recently for the difference in activity over a fraction of a half-life to be significant. Put another way, human history is so short in comparison to a half life of a billion years, that the activity of these long-lived isotopes has been effectively constant throughout our time on this planet.\n【24】 In addition, many shorter half-life and thus more intensely radioactive isotopes have not decayed out of the terrestrial environment, however, because of natural on-going production of them. Examples of these are carbon-14 (cosmogenic), radium-226 (decay product of uranium-238) and radon-222 (a decay product of radium-226).\n【25】 ### Radiation inside the human body\n【26】 Some of the essential elements that make up the human body, mainly potassium and carbon, have radioactive isotopes that add significantly to our background radiation dose. An average human contains about 30 milligrams of potassium-40 (40K) and about 10-8 grams of carbon-14 (14C). Excluding internal contamination by external radioactive material, the largest component of internal radiation exposure from biologically functional components of the human body is from potassium-40.  The decay of about 4,000 nuclei of 40K per second makes potassium the largest source of radiation in terms of number of decaying atoms.  The energy of beta particles produced by 40K is also about 10 times more powerful than the beta particles from 14C decay. There are about 1,200 beta particles per second produced by the decay of 14C. However, a 14C atom is in the genetic information of half the cells, while potassium is not a component of DNA. The decay of a 14C atom in DNA happens about 50 times per second, changing a carbon atom to one of nitrogen.\n【27】 ### Radon\n【28】 Radon is a terrestrial source of radiation that is of particular concern because, although on average it is very rare, this intensely radioactive element can be found in high concentrations in many areas of the world, where it represents a significant health hazard. Radon is a decay product of uranium, which is relatively common in the earth's crust, but generally concentrated in ore-bearing rocks scattered around the world. Radon seeps out of these ores into the atmosphere or into ground water, and in these localities it can accumulate within dwellings and expose humans to high concentrations. The widespread construction of well insulated and sealed homes in the northern industrialized world has led to radon becoming the primary source of background radiation in some localities in northern North America and Europe. Some of these areas, including Cornwall and Aberdeenshire in the United Kingdom have high enough natural radiation levels that nuclear licensed sites cannot be built there — the sites would already exceed legal radiation limits before they opened, and the natural topsoil and rock would all have to be disposed of as low-level nuclear waste.\n【29】 Radiation exposure from radon is indirect. Radon has a short half-life (4 days) and decays into other solid particulate radium-series radioactive nuclides. These radioactive particles are inhaled and remain lodged in the lungs, causing continued exposure. People in affected localities can receive up to 10 mSv per year background radiation. Radon is thus the second leading cause of lung cancer after smoking, and accounts for 15,000 to 22,000 cancer deaths per year in the US alone.\n【30】 # Human-caused background radiation\n【31】 Frequent above-ground nuclear explosions between the 1940s and 1960s scattered a substantial amount of radioactive contamination. Some of this contamination is local, rendering the immediate surroundings highly radioactive, while some of it is carried longer distances as nuclear fallout; some of this material is dispersed worldwide. The increase in background radiation due to these tests peaked in 1963 at about 0.15 mSv per year worldwide, or about 7% of average background dose from all sources. The Limited Test Ban Treaty of 1963 prohibited above-ground tests, thus by the year 2000 the worldwide dose from these historical tests has decreased to only 0.005 mSv per year.\n【32】 Even so, in certain applications, such as space satellites, materials cannot practically be created by modern steel because background radiation is sufficient to disrupt its calibration.  In the 1990s, steel was exhumed from the underwater hull of the sunken SMS Kronprinz Wilhelm for this purpose because its pre-1945 steel was preserved from background radiation throughout the nuclear era.\n【33】 Older coal-fired power plants without effective fly ash capture are one of the largest sources of human-caused background radiation exposure. When coal is burned, uranium, thorium and all the uranium daughters accumulated by disintegration — radium, radon, polonium — are released. The release of nuclear components from coal combustion far exceeds the entire U.S. consumption of nuclear fuels in nuclear generating plants. According to a 1978 article in Science magazine, \"coal-fired power plants throughout the world are the major sources of radioactive materials released to the environment\". Radioactive materials previously buried underground in coal deposits are released as fly ash or, if fly ash is captured, may be incorporated into concrete manufactured with fly ash. Radioactive materials are also released in gaseous emissions. The United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation estimates that per gigawatt-year (GWea) of electrical energy produced by coal, using the current mix of technology throughout the world, the population impact is approximately 0.8 lethal cancers per plant-year distributed over the affected population. With 400 GW of coal-fired power plants in the world, this amounts to some 320 deaths per year.\n【34】 Nuclear reactors may also release a certain amount of radioactive contamination. Under normal circumstances, a modern nuclear reactor releases minuscule amounts of radioactive contamination. Major accidents, which have fortunately been relatively rare, have also released some radioactive contamination into the environment; this is the case, for example, with the Windscale fire (Sellafield accident) and the Chernobyl accident.\n【35】 The amount of radioactive contamination released by human activity is rather small, in global terms, but the radiation background is also rather low. In fact, the total amount of radioactivity released by humans is negligible in comparison natural background radiation.\n【36】 # Artificial radiation sources\n【37】 The radiation from natural and artificial radiation sources are identical in their nature and their effects. These materials are distributed in the environment, and in our bodies, according to the chemical properties of the elements. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the United States Environmental Protection Agency, and other U.S. and international agencies, require that licensees limit radiation exposure to individual members of the public to 1 mSv (100 mrem) per year, and limit occupational radiation exposure to adults working with radioactive material to 50 mSv (5 rem) per year, and 100 mSv (10 rem) in 5 years.\n【38】 The exposure for an average person is about 3.6 mSv/year, 80 percent of which comes from natural sources of radiation. The remaining 20 percent results from exposure to artificial radiation sources, such as medical X-rays, industrial sources like smoke detectors and a small fraction from nuclear weapons tests.\n【39】 # Other usage\n【40】 In other contexts, background radiation may simply be any radiation that is pervasive. A particular example of this is the cosmic microwave background radiation, a nearly uniform glow that fills the sky in the microwave part of the spectrum; stars, galaxies and other objects of interest in radio astronomy stand out against this background.\n【41】 In a laboratory, background radiation refers to the measured value from any sources that affect an instrument when a radiation source sample is not being measured. This background rate, which must be established as a stable value by multiple measurements, usually before and after sample measurement, is subtracted from the rate measured when the sample is being measured.\n【42】 Background radiation for occupational doses measured for workers is all radiation dose that is not measured by radiation dose measurement instruments in potential occupational exposure conditions. This includes both \"natural background radiation\" and any medical radiation doses. This value is not typically measured or known from surveys, such that variations in the total dose to individual workers is not known. This can be a significant confounding factor in assessing radiation exposure effects in a population of workers who may have significantly different natural background and medical radiation doses. This is most significant when the occupational doses are very low.", "title": "Background radiation", "tags": "", "lang": "", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"overview\": \"None\", \"id\": \"b3a03a2cf467f4b82939db2d811bd26b4d359805\", \"url\": \"https://www.wikidoc.org/index.php/Background_radiation\", \"source\": \"wikidoc\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-01-28 23:07:59", "update_time": "2024-02-18 19:52:47"}

These changes were not seen in patients receiving placebo. Lp-PLA mass increased in dalcetrapib by 9.03%, but decreased in placebo by 0.36%.\n【38】 There was net difference of 4.01 mm2 decrease of total vessel area when comparing dalcetrapib to placebo after 24 weeks of therapy, as assessed by MRI. The difference between dalcetrapib and placebo showed a difference of wall area decrease by 2.2 mm2 , normalized wall index increase by 0.6%, and mean wall thickness decrease of 0.03 mm.\n【39】 After 6 months, there was no worsened arterial inflammation with dalcetrapib compared to placebo. The arterial wall target to blood ratio (TBR), a measurement of arterial inflammation, of the index vessel showed no significant changes between the two groups. The mean decrease from baseline in patients using placebo of 0.26 vs. 0.19 in dalcetrapib. The total average carotid area was less in dalcetrapib after 24 months of therapy, based on PET/CT measured changes from baseline.\n【40】 The average carotid most-diseased-segment TBR was unchagned in placebo, but was significantly decreased in dalcetrapib. However, the dalcetrapib reduction as not significant when comparing its change to baseline values.\n【41】 Elevated levels of HDL correlated significantly with reduced TBR in the dalcetrapib group (p=0.04). When HDL levels were distributed in tertiles, it was found that every HDL tertile corresponded to a 4.3% decrease in TBR (p=0.04); but due to distribution of the patient population by having lower HDL mostly in placebo group and higher HDL mostly in dalcetrapib group, the authors do not confidently associate the dalcetrapib-mediated inverse relation between HDL and TBR. Significant changes on MRI, i.e. total vessel area, wall area, and wall index, were not seen when different HDL concentrations were compared.\n【42】 There was no difference in adverse events between both groups. Vital signs, including blood pressures, were similar. Similarly, liver transaminase levels were the same. CPK levels were higher than the upper normal limit in 10% of dalcetrapib group vs. 5% in placebo; but these values were not significant.\n【43】 8% of patients receiving dalcetrapib and 11% of patients receiving placebo discontinued the study for safety reasons. Death occurred in 3 patients, two of whom were in the placebo group due to coronary heart disease and electromechanical dissociation, and one from the dalcetrapib group due to metastatic cancer. Overall, more adjudicated cardiovascular events took place in the placebo group rather than in those on dalcetrapib.\n【44】 ## Conclusion\n【45】 Dalcetrapib, a CETP inhibitor, was associated with an increase in HDL and a decrease in vascular inflammation and structural vascular changes.

Since the consensus sequence residues of the substrate to be phosphorylated make contact with the catalytic cleft of the kinase at several key amino acids (usually through hydrophobic forces and ionic bonds), a kinase is usually not specific to a single substrate, but instead can phosphorylate a whole \"substrate family\" having common recognition sequences. While the catalytic domain of these kinases is highly conserved, the sequence variation that is observed in the kinome (the subset of genes in the genome that encode kinases) provides for recognition of distinct substrates. Most kinases are inhibited by a pseudosubstrate that binds to the kinase like a real substrate but lacks the amino acid to be phosphorylated. When the pseudosubstrate is removed, the kinase can perform its normal function.\n【10】 # EC numbers\n【11】 Many serine/threonine protein kinases do not have their own individual EC numbers and use \"2.7.11.1\". These were formerly included in EC number \"2.7.1.37\", which was a general EC number for any enzyme that phosphorylates proteins while converting ATP to ADP (i.e. ATP:protein phosphotransferases.) This category is currently being reviewed by the Nomenclature Committee of IUBMB (NC-IUBMB), and it is believed that the various serine/threonine-kinases will get their own EC numbers eventually.\n【12】 # Types\n【13】 - Phosphorylase kinase (EC 2.7.11.19) was in fact, the first Ser/Thr protein kinase to be discovered (in 1959 by Krebs et al.).\n【14】 - Protein kinase A (EC 2.7.11.1) consists of two domains, a small domain with several β sheet structures and a larger domain containing several α helices. The binding sites for substrate and ATP are located in the catalytic cleft between the domains (or lobes). When ATP and substrate bind, the two lobes rotate so that the terminal phosphate group of the ATP and the target amino acid of the substrate move into the correct positions for the catalytic reaction to take place.\n【15】 - Protein Kinase B is also known as AKT kinase. The v-akt gene was identified as the oncogene of retrovirus AKT8. The gene codes for a protein kinase. Human homologs of the AKT8 oncogenic protein were identified in 1987.By 1995 it had been found that Akt kinases function as mitogen-activated kinases downstream from cell surface receptors that activate phosphoinositide 3-kinase. Three human akt genes exist. All three Akt kinases regulate cell proliferation and Akt2 is particularly important for insulin actions in cells. A major target of Akt kinases is glycogen synthase kinase-3.\n【16】 - Protein kinase C ('PKC', EC 2.7.11.1) is actually a family of protein kinases consisting of ~10 isozymes. They are divided into three subfamilies: conventional (or classical), novel, and atypical based on their second messenger requirements.\n【17】 - Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases or CaM kinases (EC 2.7.11.17), are primarily regulated by the Ca2+/calmodulin complex.\n【18】 - Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) (EC 2.7.11.1) respond to extracellular stimuli (mitogens) and regulate various cellular activities, such as gene expression, mitosis, differentiation, and cell survival/apoptosis.\n【19】 - Mos/Raf kinases form part of the MAPKK Kinase family and are activated by growth factors.

It was marketed by Merck & Co. to treat osteoarthritis, acute pain conditions, and dysmenorrhoea. Rofecoxib was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on May 20, 1999, and was marketed under the brand names Vioxx, Ceoxx, and Ceeoxx.\n【3】 Rofecoxib gained widespread acceptance among physicians treating patients with arthritis and other conditions causing chronic or acute pain. Worldwide, over 80 million people were prescribed rofecoxib at some time.\n【4】 On September 30, 2004, Merck withdrew rofecoxib from the market because of concerns about increased risk of heart attack and stroke associated with long-term, high-dosage use. Merck withdrew the drug after disclosures that it withheld information about rofecoxib's risks from doctors and patients for over five years, resulting in between 88,000 and 140,000 cases of serious heart disease. Rofecoxib was one of the most widely used drugs ever to be withdrawn from the market. In the year before withdrawal, Merck had sales revenue of US$2.5 billion from Vioxx. Merck reserved $970 million to pay for its Vioxx-related legal expenses through 2007, and have set aside $4.85bn for legal claims from US citizens.\n【5】 Rofecoxib was available on prescription in both tablet-form and as an oral suspension. It was available by injection for hospital use.\n【6】 # Mode of action\n【7】 Cyclooxygenase (COX) has two well-studied isoforms, called COX-1 and COX-2. COX-1 mediates the synthesis of prostaglandins responsible for protection of the stomach lining, while COX-2 mediates the synthesis of prostaglandins responsible for pain and inflammation. By creating \"selective\" NSAIDs that inhibit COX-2, but not COX-1, the same pain relief as traditional NSAIDs is offered, but with greatly reduced risk of fatal or debilitating peptic ulcers. Rofecoxib is a selective COX-2 inhibitor, or \"coxib\".\n【8】 Others include Merck's etoricoxib (Arcoxia), Pfizer’s celecoxib (Celebrex) and valdecoxib (Bextra). Interestingly, at the time of its withdrawal, rofecoxib was the only coxib with clinical evidence of its superior gastrointestinal adverse effect profile over conventional NSAIDs. This was largely based on the VIGOR (Vioxx GI Outcomes Research) study, which compared the efficacy and adverse effect profiles of rofecoxib and naproxen.\n【9】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n【10】 The therapeutic recommended dosages were 12.5, 25, and 50 mg with an approximate bioavailability of 93%. Rofecoxib crossed the placenta and blood–brain barrier, and took 1–3 hours to reach peak plasma concentration with an effective half-life (based on steady-state levels) of approximately 17 hours. The metabolic products are cis-dihydro and trans-dihydro derivatives of rofecoxib which are primarily excreted through urine.\n【11】 ## Fabricated efficacy studies\n【12】 On March 11, 2009, Scott S. Reuben, former chief of acute pain at Baystate Medical Center, Springfield, Mass., revealed that data for 21 studies he had authored for the efficacy of the drug (along with others such as celecoxib) had been fabricated in order to augment the analgesic effects of the drugs. There is no evidence that Reuben colluded with Merck in falsifying his data. Reuben was also a former paid spokesperson for the drug company Pfizer (which owns the intellectual property rights for marketing celecoxib in the United States). The retracted studies were not submitted to either the FDA or the European Union's regulatory agencies prior to the drug's approval. Drug manufacturer Merck had no comment on the disclosure.\n【13】 # Adverse drug reactions\n【14】 Aside from the reduced incidence of gastric ulceration, rofecoxib exhibits a similar adverse effect profile to other NSAIDs.\n【15】 Prostaglandin is a large family of lipids. Prostaglandin I2/PGI2/prostacyclin is just one member of it. Prostaglandins other than PGI2 (such as PGE2) also play important roles in vascular tone regulation. Prostacyclin/thromboxane are produced by both COX-1 and COX-2, and rofecoxib suppresses just COX-2 enzyme, so there is no reason to believe that prostacyclin levels are significantly reduced by the drug. And there is no reason to believe that only the balance between quantities of prostacyclin and thromboxane is the determinant factor for vascular tone. Indeed Merck has stated that there was no effect on prostacyclin production in blood vessels in animal testing. Other researchers have speculated that the cardiotoxicity may be associated with maleic anhydride metabolites formed when rofecoxib becomes ionized under physiological conditions. (Reddy & Corey, 2005)\n【16】 ## Adverse cardiovascular events\n【17】 ### VIGOR study and publishing controversy\n【18】 The VIGOR (Vioxx GI Outcomes Research) study, conducted by Bombardier, et al., which compared the efficacy and adverse effect profiles of rofecoxib and naproxen, had indicated a significant 4-fold increased risk of acute myocardial infarction (heart attack) in rofecoxib patients when compared with naproxen patients (0.4% vs 0.1%, RR 0.25) over the 12 month span of the study. The elevated risk began during the second month on rofecoxib. There was no significant difference in the mortality from cardiovascular events between the two groups, nor was there any significant difference in the rate of myocardial infarction between the rofecoxib and naproxen treatment groups in patients without high cardiovascular risk. The difference in overall risk was by the patients at higher risk of heart attack, i.e. those meeting the criteria for low-dose aspirin prophylaxis of secondary cardiovascular events (previous myocardial infarction, angina, cerebrovascular accident, transient ischemic attack, or coronary artery bypass).\n【19】 Merck's scientists interpreted the finding as a protective effect of naproxen, telling the FDA that the difference in heart attacks \"is primarily due to\" this protective effect. Some commentators have noted that naproxen would have to be three times as effective as aspirin to account for all of the difference, and some outside scientists warned Merck that this claim was implausible before VIGOR was published. No evidence has since emerged for such a large cardioprotective effect of naproxen, although a number of studies have found protective effects similar in size to those of aspirin. Though Dr. Topol's 2004 paper criticized Merck's naproxen hypothesis, he himself co-authored a 2001 JAMA article stating \"because of the evidence for an antiplatelet effect of naproxen, it is difficult to assess whether the difference in cardiovascular event rates in VIGOR was due to a benefit from naproxen or to a prothrombotic effect from rofecoxib.\" (Mukherjee, Nissen and Topol, 2001.)\n【20】 The results of the VIGOR study were submitted to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in February 2001. In September 2001, the FDA sent a warning letter to the CEO of Merck, stating, \"Your promotional campaign discounts the fact that in the VIGOR study, patients on Vioxx were observed to have a four to five fold increase in myocardial infarctions (MIs) compared to patients on the comparator non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), Naprosyn (naproxen).\" This led to the introduction, in April 2002, of warnings on Vioxx labeling concerning the increased risk of cardiovascular events (heart attack and stroke).\n【21】 Months after the preliminary version of VIGOR was published in the New England Journal of Medicine, the journal editors learned that certain data reported to the FDA were not included in the NEJM article. Several years later, when they were shown a Merck memo during the depositions for the first federal Vioxx trial, they realized that these data had been available to the authors months before publication. The editors wrote an editorial accusing the authors of deliberately withholding the data. They released the editorial to the media on December 8, 2005, before giving the authors a chance to respond. NEJM editor Gregory Curfman explained that the quick release was due to the imminent presentation of his deposition testimony, which he feared would be misinterpreted in the media. He had earlier denied any relationship between the timing of the editorial and the trial. Although his testimony was not actually used in the December trial, Curfman had testified well before the publication of the editorial.\n【22】 The editors charged that \"more than four months before the article was published, at least two of its authors were aware of critical data on an array of adverse cardiovascular events that were not included in the VIGOR article.\" These additional data included three additional heart attacks, and raised the relative risk of Vioxx from 4.25-fold to 5-fold. All the additional heart attacks occurred in the group at low risk of heart attack (the \"aspirin not indicated\" group) and the editors noted that the omission \"resulted in the misleading conclusion that there was a difference in the risk of myocardial infarction between the aspirin indicated and aspirin not indicated groups.\" The relative risk for myocardial infarctions among the aspirin not indicated patients increased from 2.25 to 3 (although it remained statitistically insignificant). The editors also noted a statistically significant (2-fold) increase in risk for serious thromboembolic events for this group, an outcome that Merck had not reported in the NEJM, though it had disclosed that information publicly in March 2000, eight months before publication.\n【23】 The authors of the study, including the non-Merck authors, responded by claiming that the three additional heart attacks had occurred after the prespecified cutoff date for data collection and thus were appropriately not included. (Utilizing the prespecified cutoff date also meant that an additional stroke in the naproxen population was not reported.) Furthermore, they said that the additional data did not qualitatively change any of the conclusions of the study, and the results of the full analyses were disclosed to the FDA and reflected on the Vioxx warning label. They further noted that all of the data in the \"omitted\" table were printed in the text of the article. The authors stood by the original article.\n【24】 NEJM stood by its editorial, noting that the cutoff date was never mentioned in the article, nor did the authors report that the cutoff for cardiovascular adverse events was before that for gastrointestinal adverse events. The different cutoffs increased the reported benefits of Vioxx (reduced stomach problems) relative to the risks (increased heart attacks).\n【25】 Some scientists have accused the NEJM editorial board of making unfounded accusations. Others have applauded the editorial. Renowned research cardiologist Eric Topol, a prominent Merck critic, accused Merck of \"manipulation of data\" and said \"I think now the scientific misconduct trial is really fully backed up\". Phil Fontanarosa, executive editor of the prestigious Journal of the American Medical Association, welcomed the editorial, saying \"this is another in the long list of recent examples that have generated real concerns about trust and confidence in industry-sponsored studies\".\n【26】 On May 15, 2006, the Wall Street Journal reported that a late night email, written by an outside public relations specialist and sent to Journal staffers hours before the Expression of Concern was released, predicted that \"the rebuke would divert attention to Merck and induce the media to ignore the New England Journal of Medicine's own role in aiding Vioxx sales.\"\n【27】 \"Internal emails show the New England Journal's expression of concern was timed to divert attention from a deposition in which Executive Editor Gregory Curfman made potentially damaging admissions about the journal's handling of the Vioxx study. In the deposition, part of the Vioxx litigation, Dr. Curfman acknowledged that lax editing might have helped the authors make misleading claims in the article.\" The Journal stated that NEJM's \"ambiguous\" language misled reporters into incorrectly believing that Merck had deleted data regarding the three additional heart attacks, rather than a blank table that contained no statistical information; \"the New England Journal says it didn't attempt to have these mistakes corrected.\"\n【28】 ### Alzheimer's studies\n【29】 In 2000 and 2001, Merck conducted several studies of rofecoxib aimed at determining if the drug slowed the onset of Alzheimer's disease. Merck has placed great emphasis on these studies on the grounds that they are relatively large (almost 3000 patients) and compared rofecoxib to a placebo rather than to another pain reliever. These studies found an elevated death rate among rofecoxib patients, although the deaths were not generally heart-related. However, they did not find any elevated cardiovascular risk due to rofecoxib. Before 2004, Merck cited these studies as providing evidence, contrary to VIGOR, of rofecoxib's safety.\n【30】 ### APPROVe study\n【31】 In 2001, Merck commenced the APPROVe (Adenomatous Polyp PRevention On Vioxx) study, a three-year trial with the primary aim of evaluating the efficacy of rofecoxib for the prophylaxis of colorectal polyps. Celecoxib had already been approved for this indication, and it was hoped to add this to the indications for rofecoxib as well. An additional aim of the study was to further evaluate the cardiovascular safety of rofecoxib.\n【32】 The APPROVe study was terminated early when the preliminary data from the study showed an increased relative risk of adverse thrombotic cardiovascular events (including heart attack and stroke), beginning after 18 months of rofecoxib therapy. In patients taking rofecoxib, versus placebo, the relative risk of these events was 1.92 (rofecoxib 1.50 events vs placebo 0.78 events per 100 patient years). The results from the first 18 months of the APPROVe study did not show an increased relative risk of adverse cardiovascular events. Moreover, overall and cardiovascular mortality rates were similar between the rofecoxib and placebo populations.\n【33】 In summary, the APPROVe study suggested that long-term use of rofecoxib resulted in nearly twice the risk of suffering a heart attack or stroke compared to patients receiving a placebo.\n【34】 ### Other studies\n【35】 Pre-approval Phase III clinical trials, like the APPROVe study, showed no increased relative risk of adverse cardiovascular events for the first eighteen months of rofecoxib usage (Merck, 2004). Others have pointed out that \"study 090,\" a pre-approval trial, showed a 3-fold increase in cardiovascular events compared to placebo, a 7-fold increase compared to nabumetone (another ), and an 8-fold increase in heart attacks and strokes combined compared to both control groups. Although this was a relatively small study and only the last result was statistically significant, critics have charged that this early finding should have prompted Merck to quickly conduct larger studies of rofecoxib's cardiovascular safety. Merck notes that it had already begun VIGOR at the time Study 090 was completed. Although VIGOR was primarily designed to demonstrate new uses for rofecoxib, it also collected data on adverse cardiovascular outcomes.\n【36】 Several very large observational studies have also found elevated risk of heart attack from rofecoxib. For example, a recent retrospective study of 113,000 elderly Canadians suggested a borderline statistically significant increased relative risk of heart attacks of 1.24 from Vioxx usage, with a relative risk of 1.73 for higher-dose Vioxx usage. (Levesque, 2005). Another study, using Kaiser Permanente data, found a 1.47 relative risk for low-dose Vioxx usage and 3.58 for high-dose Vioxx usage compared to current use of celecoxib, though the smaller number was not statistically significant, and relative risk compared to other populations was not statistically significant. (Graham, 2005).\n【37】 Furthermore, a more recent meta-study of 114 randomized trials with a total of 116,000+ participants, published in JAMA, showed that Vioxx uniquely increased risk of renal (kidney) disease, and heart arrhythmia.\n【38】 ### Other COX-2 inhibitors\n【39】 Any increased risk of renal and arrhythmia pathologies associated with the class of COX-2 inhibitors, e.g. celecoxib (Celebrex), valdecoxib (Bextra), parecoxib (Dynastat), lumiracoxib, and etoricoxib is not evident, although smaller studies had demonstrated such effects earlier with the use of celecoxib, valdecoxib and parecoxib.\n【40】 Nevertheless, it is likely that trials of newer drugs in the category will be extended in order to supply additional evidence of cardiovascular safety. Examples are some more specific COX-2 inhibitors, including etoricoxib (Arcoxia) and lumiracoxib (Prexige), which are currently (circa 2005) undergoing Phase III/IV clinical trials.\n【41】 Besides, regulatory authorities worldwide now require warnings about cardiovascular risk of COX-2 inhibitors still on the market. For example, in 2005, EU regulators required the following changes to the product information and/or packaging of all COX-2 inhibitors:\n【42】 - Contraindications stating that COX-2 inhibitors must not be used in patients with established ischaemic heart disease and/or cerebrovascular disease (stroke), and also in patients with peripheral arterial disease\n【43】 - Reinforced warnings to healthcare professionals to exercise caution when prescribing COX-2 inhibitors to patients with risk factors for heart disease, such as hypertension, hyperlipidaemia (high cholesterol levels), diabetes and smoking\n【44】 - Given the association between cardiovascular risk and exposure to COX-2 inhibitors, doctors are advised to use the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible duration of treatment\n【45】 ### Other NSAIDs\n【46】 Since the withdrawal of Vioxx it has come to light that there may be negative cardiovascular effects with not only other COX-2 inhibitiors, but even the majority of other NSAIDs. It is only with the recent development of drugs like Vioxx that drug companies have carried out the kind of well executed trials that could establish such effects and these sort of trials have never been carried out in older \"trusted\" NSAIDs such as ibuprofen, diclofenac and others. The possible exceptions may be aspirin and naproxen due to their anti-platelet aggregation properties.\n【47】 # Withdrawal\n【48】 Due to the findings of its own APPROVe study, Merck publicly announced its voluntary withdrawal of the drug from the market worldwide on September 30, 2004.\n【49】 In addition to its own studies, on September 23, 2004 Merck apparently received information about new research by the FDA that supported previous findings of increased risk of heart attack among rofecoxib users (Grassley, 2004). FDA analysts estimated that Vioxx caused between 88,000 and 139,000 heart attacks, 30 to 40 percent of which were probably fatal, in the five years the drug was on the market.\n【50】 On November 5, the medical journal The Lancet published a meta-analysis of the available studies on the safety of rofecoxib (Jüni et al., 2004). The authors concluded that, owing to the known cardiovascular risk, rofecoxib should have been withdrawn several years earlier. The Lancet published an editorial which condemned both Merck and the FDA for the continued availability of rofecoxib from 2000 until the recall. Merck responded by issuing a rebuttal of the Jüni et al. meta-analysis that noted that Jüni omitted several studies that showed no increased cardiovascular risk. (Merck & Co., 2004).\n【51】 In 2005, advisory panels in both the U.S. and Canada encouraged the return of rofecoxib to the market, stating that rofecoxib's benefits outweighed the risks for some patients. The FDA advisory panel voted 17-15 to allow the drug to return to the market despite being found to increase heart risk. The vote in Canada was 12-1, and the Canadian panel noted that the cardiovascular risks from rofecoxib seemed to be no worse than those from ibuprofen—though the panel recommended that further study was needed for all NSAIDs to fully understand their risk profiles. Notwithstanding these recommendations, Merck has not returned rofecoxib to the market.\n【52】 In 2005, Merck retained Debevoise & Plimpton LLP to investigate Vioxx study results and communications conducted by Merck. Through the report, it was found that Merck's senior management acted in good faith, and that the confusion over the clinical safety of Vioxx was due to the sales team's overzealous behavior. The report that was filed gave a timeline of the events surrounding Vioxx and showed that Merck intended to operate honestly throughout the process. Any mistakes that were made regarding the mishandling of clinical trial results and withholding of information was the result of oversight, not malicious behavior. The Martin Report did conclude that the Merck's marketing team exaggerated the safety of Vioxx and replaced truthful information with sales tactics. The report was published in February 2006, and Merck was satisfied with the findings of the report and promised to consider the recommendations contained in the Martin Report.\n【53】 # Litigation\n【54】 As of March 2006, there had been over 10,000 cases and 190 class actions filed against Merck over adverse cardiovascular events associated with rofecoxib and the adequacy of Merck's warnings. The first wrongful death trial, Rogers v. Merck, was scheduled in Alabama in the spring of 2005, but was postponed after Merck argued that the plaintiff had falsified evidence of rofecoxib use.\n【55】 On August 19, 2005, a jury in Texas voted 10-2 to hold Merck liable for the death of Robert Ernst, a 59-year-old man who allegedly died of a rofecoxib-induced heart attack. The plaintiffs' lead attorney was Mark Lanier. Merck argued that the death was due to cardiac arrhythmia, which had not been shown to be associated with rofecoxib use. The jury awarded Carol Ernst, widow of Robert Ernst, $253.4 million in damages. This award will almost certainly be capped at no more than US$26.1 million because of punitive damages limits under Texas law. As of March 2006, the plaintiff had yet to ask the court to enter a judgment on the verdict; Merck has stated that it will appeal.\n【56】 On November 3, 2005, Merck won the second case Humeston v. Merck, a personal injury case, in Atlantic City, New Jersey. The plaintiff experienced a mild myocardial infarction and claimed that rofecoxib was responsible, after having taken it for two months. Merck argued that there was no evidence that rofecoxib was the cause of Humeston's injury and that there is no scientific evidence linking rofecoxib to cardiac events with short durations of use. The jury ruled that Merck had adequately warned doctors and patients of the drug's risk.\n【57】 The first federal trial on rofecoxib, Plunkett v. Merck, began on November 29, 2005 in Houston. The trial ended in a hung jury and a mistrial was declared on December 12, 2005. According to the Wall Street Journal, the jury hung by an eight to one majority, favoring the defense. Upon retrial in February 2006 in New Orleans, where the Vioxx multidistrict litigation (MDL) is based, a jury found Merck not liable, even though the plaintiffs had the NEJM editor testify as to his objections to the VIGOR study.\n【58】 On January 30, 2006, a New Jersey state court dismissed a case brought by Edgar Lee Boyd, who blamed Vioxx for gastrointestinal bleeding that he experienced after taking the drug. The judge said that Boyd failed to prove the drug caused his stomach pain and internal bleeding.\n【59】 In January 2006, Garza v. Merck began trial in Rio Grande City, Texas. The plaintiff, a 71-year-old smoker with heart disease, had a fatal heart attack three weeks after finishing a one-week sample of rofecoxib. On April 21, 2006 the jury awarded the plaintiff $7 million compensatory and $25 million punitive. The Texas state court of appeals in San Antonio later rules Garza's fatal heart attack probably resulted from pre-existing health conditions unrelated to his taking of Vioxx, thus reversing the $32 million jury award.\n【60】 On April 5, 2006, the jury held Merck liable for the heart attack of 77-year-old John McDarby, and awarded Mr McDarby $4.5 million in compensatory damages based on Merck's failure to properly warn of Vioxx safety risks. After a hearing on April 11, 2006, the jury also awarded Mr McDarby an additional $9 million in punitive damages. The same jury found Merck not liable for the heart attack of 60-year-old Thomas Cona, a second plaintiff in the trial, but was liable for fraud in the sale of the drug to Cona.\n【61】 In March 2010, an Australian class-action lawsuit against Merck ruled that Vioxx doubled the risk of heart attacks, and that Merck had breached the Trade Practices Act by selling a drug which was unfit for sale.\n【62】 In 2010, the national US case against Vioxx and Merck was resolved with a $4.85 billion settlement. After the settlement, the lawyers for the case disputed the $315 million awarded in legal fees. Ultimately, the judge determined how the fees would be awarded to the plaintiff’s attorneys. The judge additionally ordered the plaintiff lawyers to cap their fees at 32% of the settlement amount.\n【63】 The above dispute over lawyer fees has caused scholars and observers to consider tort reform throughout the country. Articles on the subject include The Vioxx Litigation: A Critical Look at Trial Tactics, the Tort System, and the Roles of Lawyers in Mass Tort Litigation  and 10 Years of Tort Reform in Texas Bring Fewer Suits, Lower Payouts.\n【64】 In November 2011, Merck announced a civil settlement with the US Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts, and individually with 43 US states and the District of Columbia, to resolve civil claims relating to Vioxx. Under the terms of the settlement, Merck agreed to pay two-thirds of a previously recorded $950 million reserve charge in exchange for release from civil liability. Litigation with seven additional states remains outstanding. Under separate criminal proceedings, Merck plead guilty to a federal misdemeanor charge relating to the marketing of the drug across state lines, incurring a fine of $321.6 million.\n【65】 # Other effects\n【66】 Rofecoxib was shown to improve premenstrual acne vulgaris in a placebo controlled study.", "title": "Rofecoxib", "tags": "", "lang": "", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"id\": \"99bf90a923bc33ee409546b4dea8c4cdbe90faac\", \"source\": \"wikidoc\", \"url\": \"https://www.wikidoc.org/index.php/Rofecoxib\", \"overview\": \"None\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-01-28 23:07:59", "update_time": "2024-02-18 22:41:52"}

The compound is reported to have a bad taste and smell.\n【4】 # Effects\n【5】 In his book PIHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved), Shulgin lists the dosage range as 30 to 50 mg. 2C-T-8 is generally taken orally, and effects typically last 10 to 15 hours.  Experiences have varied between insight and creativity at low doses to hypersensitivity and paranoia at higher doses. A \"thinking-connection\" that is characteristic of the 2C-T group is evident in this chemical in stark contrast to the \"pure euphoria\" of phenethylamines such as MDMA.\n【6】 # Legality\n【7】 2C-T-8 is unscheduled and uncontrolled in the United States, but possession and sales of 2C-T-8 will probably be prosecuted under the Federal Analog Act because of its structural similarities to 2C-T-7. However, 2C-T-8, unlike many other phenethylamines has not been sold by internet retailers. In the wake of Operation Web Tryp in July 2004, the issue of possession and sales of 2C-T-8 and other similar chemicals will probably be resolved in the courtroom as will the fate of this rare but unique psychedelic.

Other phenethylamine derivatives substituted with an alkylthio group at the 4 position such as 2C-T-7 and 4-MTA are known to act as selective monoamine oxidase A inhibitors, a side effect which can lead to lethal serotonin syndrome when they are combined with stimulant drugs.\n【12】 There have been no confirmed deaths due to 2C-T-8, though this may in part be due to its rarity and limited usage. Of the 2C-T family, there have been a few confirmed deaths due to 2C-T-7, which involved either insufflating large (30mg+) doses and in one case an unknown oral dose was combined with 200mg MDMA.\n【13】 # Popularity\n【14】 2C-T-8 is unknown on the black market.

These maintenance activities are primarily performed without conscious control or sensation.  The ANS has far reaching effects, including: heart rate, digestion, respiration rate, salivation, perspiration, diameter of the pupils, micturition (the discharge of urine), and sexual arousal.  Whereas most of its actions are involuntary, some ANS functions work in tandem with the conscious mind, such as breathing.  Its main components are its sensory system, motor system (comprised of the parasympathetic nervous system and sympathetic nervous system), and the enteric nervous system.\n【3】 The ANS is a classical term, widely used throughout the scientific and medical community. Its most useful definition could be: the sensory and motor neurons that innervate the viscera. These neurons form reflex arcs that pass through the lower brainstem or medulla oblongata. This explains that when the central nervous system (CNS) is damaged experimentally or by accident above that level, a vegetative life is still possible, whereby cardiovascular, digestive and respiratory functions are adequately regulated.\n【4】 # Anatomy\n【5】 The reflex arcs of the ANS comprise a sensory (or afferent) arm, and a motor (or efferent, or effector) arm. The latter alone is represented on the figure.\n【6】 ## Sensory neurons\n【7】 The sensory arm is made of “primary visceral sensory neurons” found in the peripheral nervous system (PNS), in “cranial sensory ganglia”: the geniculate, petrosal and nodose ganglia, appended respectively to cranial nerves VII, IX and X. These sensory neurons monitor the levels of carbon dioxide, oxygen and sugar in the blood, arterial pressure and the chemical composition of the stomach and gut content. (They also convey the sense of taste, a conscious perception).\n【8】 Blood oxygen and carbon dioxide are in fact directly sensed by the carotid body, a small collection of chemosensors at the bifurcation of the carotid artery, innervated by the petrosal (IXth) ganglion.\n【9】 Primary sensory neurons project (synapse) onto “second order” or relay visceral sensory neurons located in the medulla oblongata, forming the nucleus of the solitary tract (nTS), that integrates all visceral information. The nTS also receives input from a nearby chemosensory center, the area postrema, that detects toxins in the blood and the cerebrospinal fluid and is essential for chemically induced vomiting and conditional taste aversion (the memory that ensures that an animal which has been poisoned by a food never touches it again).\n【10】 All these visceral sensory informations constantly and unconsciously modulate the activity of the motor neurons of the ANS\n【11】 ## Motor neurons\n【12】 Motor neurons of the ANS are also located in ganglia of the PNS, called “autonomic ganglia”. They belong to three categories with different effects on their target organs (see below “Function”): sympathetic, parasympathetic and enteric.\n【13】 Sympathetic ganglia are located in two sympathetic chains close to the spinal cord: the prevertebral and pre-aortic chains.\n【14】 Parasympathetic ganglia, in contrast, are located in close proximity to the target organ: the submandibular ganglion close to salivatory glands, paracardiac ganglia close to the heart etc…\n【15】 Enteric ganglia, which as their name implies innervate the digestive tube, are located inside its walls and collectively contain as many neurons as the entire spinal cord, including local sensory neurons, motor neurons and interneurons. It is the only truly autonomous part of the ANS and the digestive tube can function surprisingly well even in isolation. For that reason the enteric nervous system has been called “the second brain”.\n【16】 The activity of autonomic ganglionic neurons is modulated by “preganglionic neurons” (also called improperly but classically \"visceral motoneurons\") located in the central nervous system. Preganglionc sympathetic neurons are in the spinal cord, at thoraco-lumbar levels. Preganglionic parasympathetic neurons are in the medulla oblongata (forming visceral motor nuclei: the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve (dmnX), the nucleus ambiguus, and salivatory nuclei) and in the sacral spinal cord. Enteric neurons are also modulated by input from the CNS, from preganglionic neurons located, like parasympathetic ones, in the medulla oblongata (in the dmnX).\n【17】 The feedback from the sensory to the motor arm of visceral reflex pathways is provided by direct or indirect connections between the nucleus of the solitary tract and visceral motoneurons.\n【18】 # Function\n【19】 Sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions typically function in opposition to each other. But this opposition is better termed complementary in nature rather than antagonistic. For an analogy, one may think of the sympathetic division as the accelerator and the parasympathetic division as the brake. The sympathetic division typically functions in actions requiring quick responses. The parasympathetic division functions with actions that do not require immediate reaction. Consider sympathetic as \"fight or flight\" and parasympathetic as \"rest and digest\".\n【20】 However, many instances of sympathetic and parasympathetic activity cannot be ascribed to \"fight\" or \"rest\" situations. For example, standing up from a reclining or sitting position would entail an unsustainable drop in blood pressure if not for a compensatory increase in the arterial sympathetic tonus. Another example is the constant, second to second modulation of heart rate by sympathetic and parasympathetic influences, as a function of the respiratory cycles. More generally, these two systems should be seen as permanently modulating vital functions, in usually antagonistic fashion, to achieve homeostasis. Some typical actions of the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems are listed below:\n【21】 ## Sympathetic nervous system\n【22】 Promotes a \"fight or flight\" response, corresponds with arousal and energy generation, inhibits digestion:\n【23】 - Diverts blood flow away from the gastro-intestinal (GI) tract and skin via vasoconstriction.\n【24】 - Blood flow to skeletal muscles, the lung is not only maintained, but enhanced (by as much as 1200%, in the case of skeletal muscles).\n【25】 - Dilates bronchioles of the lung, which allows for greater alveolar oxygen exchange.\n【26】 - Increases heart rate and the contractility of cardiac cells (myocytes), thereby providing a mechanism for the enhanced blood flow to skeletal muscles.\n【27】 - Dilates pupils and relaxes the lens, allowing more light to enter the eye.\n【28】 ## Parasympathetic nervous system\n【29】 Promotes a *rest and digest\" response; promotes calming of the nerves and return to regular function, enhances digestion.\n【30】 - Dilates blood vessels leading to the GI tract, increasing blood flow. This is important following the consumption of food, due to the greater metabolic demands placed on the body by the gut.\n【31】 - The parasympathetic nervous system can also constrict the bronchiolar diameter when the need for oxygen has diminished.\n【32】 - During accommodation, the parasympathetic nervous system causes constriction of the pupil and lens.\n【33】 - The parasympathetic nervous system stimulates salivary gland secretion, and accelerates peristalsis, so, in keeping with the rest and digest functions, appropriate PNS activity mediates digestion of food and indirectly, the absorption of nutrients.\n【34】 - Is also involved in erection of genitals, via the pelvic splanchnic nerves 2–4.\n【35】 # Neurotransmitters and pharmacology\n【36】 At the effector organs, sympathetic ganglionic neurons release noradrenaline (norepinephrine), along with other cotransmittors such as ATP, to act on adrenergic receptors, with the exception of the sweat glands and the adrenal medulla:\n【37】 - acetycholine is the preganglionic neurotransmitter for both divisions of the ANS, as well as the postganglionic neurotransmitter of parasympathetic neurons. Nerves that release acetylcholine are said to be cholinergic. In the parasympathetic system, ganglionic neurons use acetylcholine as a neurotransmitter, to stimulate muscarinic receptors.\n【38】 - At the adrenal cortex, there is no postsynaptic neuron. Instead the presynaptic neuron releases acetylcholine to act on nicotinic receptors.\n【39】 - Stimulation of the adrenal medulla releases adrenaline (epinephrine) into the bloodstream which will act on adrenoceptors, producing a widespread increase in sympathetic activity.\n【40】 The following table reviews the actions of these neurotransmitters as a function of their receptors.\n【41】 ## circulatory system\n【42】 ### Heart\n【43】 ### Blood vessels\n【44】 ### Other\n【45】 ## respiratory system\n【46】 The bronchioles have no sympathetic innervation, but are instead affected by circulating adrenaline \n【47】 ## nervous system\n【48】 ## digestive system\n【49】 ## endocrine system\n【50】 ## urinary system\n【51】 ## reproductive system\n【52】 ## integument", "title": "Autonomic nervous system", "tags": "", "lang": "", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"id\": \"4b17c14c08143c279013e64a9cc3c2fbc338df4c\", \"url\": \"https://www.wikidoc.org/index.php/Autonomic\", \"overview\": \"None\", \"source\": \"wikidoc\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-01-28 23:07:59", "update_time": "2024-02-18 18:47:23"}

Surfer's ear is not the same as swimmer's ear.\n【3】 Irritation from cold wind and water exposure causes the bone surrounding the ear canal to develop lumps of new bony growth which constrict the ear canal. The condition is so named due to its prevalence among cold water surfers. Cold water surfers experience surfer's ear at about six times the rate of warm water surfers.\n【4】 The condition is not limited to surfing and can occur in any activity with cold, wet, windy conditions such as kayaking, sailing,diving. Most avid surfers have at least some mild bone growths (exostoses), causing little to no problems. The condition is progressive, making it important to take preventative measures early, preferably whenever surfing.\n【5】 # Etiology\n【6】 # Symptoms\n【7】 In general one ear will be much worse than the other due to the areas prevailing wind direction or the side that most often strikes the wave first.\n【8】 - Decreased hearing or hearing loss, temporary or ongoing\n【9】 - Increased prevalence of ear infections, causing ear pain\n【10】 - Difficulty evacuating debris or water from the ear causing a plugging sensation\n【11】 - Normal Ear Canal\n【12】 Normal Ear Canal\n【13】 - Normal Ear Canal\n【14】 Normal Ear Canal\n【15】 - Exostosis in Ear Canal\n【16】 Exostosis in Ear Canal\n【17】 - Exostosis in Ear Canal\n【18】 Exostosis in Ear Canal\n【19】 # Treatment\n【20】 Traditionally surfer's ear has been treated by exostectomy wherein a small incision is opened behind the ear and the bone growth is removed using a surgical drill. When exostoses are completely removed there is little chance of recurrence requiring repeat surgery in the future. The postauricular approach minimizes complications by providing a proper operative trajectory to the exostoses.\n【21】 During recuperation it is extremely important not to return to the water for at least four weeks to avoid infection or complications. The operation is performed under general anesthesia.\n【22】 Some doctors now use extremely small chisels and enter directly through the ear canal. While not requiring an incision behind the ear, this procedure has resulted in accidental mobilization of the ear canal in several cases, and still requires use of a drill near the eardrum.\n【23】 Unprotected exposure of ear canals to cold water and wind after treatment can lead to regrowth of bone and the need for repeated operations on the same ear.\n【24】 # Prevention\n【25】 Just as it iss possible that motorcycle helmets increase nonhead related injuries due to increased risk-taking , the widespread use of wetsuit hoods, caps, and neoprene bands has allowed people to surf in much colder waters, which probably has increased the incidence and severity of surfer's ear for those that don't properly protect their ears.\n【26】 Other recommendations:\n【27】 - Avoid activity during extremely cold or windy conditions.\n【28】 - Keep the ear canal as warm and dry as possible.\n【29】 Ear plugs\n【30】 Neoprene hood\n【31】 swim cap\n【32】 - Ear plugs\n【33】 - Neoprene hood\n【34】 - swim cap", "title": "Surfer's Ear", "tags": "", "lang": "", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"https://www.wikidoc.org/index.php/Surfer%27s_Ear\", \"overview\": \"None\", \"id\": \"9ebd3b43fb1cfdbc8565461bcb15145356e70c37\", \"source\": \"wikidoc\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-01-28 23:07:59", "update_time": "2024-02-18 22:55:56"}

Stress management is effective when a person utilizes strategies to cope with or alter stressful situations.\n【2】 # Historical foundations\n【3】 Walter Cannon and Hans Selye used animal studies to establish the earliest scientific basis for the study of stress.  They measured the physiological responses of animals to external pressures, such as heat and cold, prolonged restraint, and surgical procedures, then extrapolated from these studies to human beings. \n【4】 Subsequent studies of stress in humans by Richard Rahe and others established the view that stress is caused by distinct, measureable life stressors, and further, that these life stressors can be ranked by the median degree of stress they produce (leading to the Holmes and Rahe Stress Scale). Thus, stress was traditionally conceptualized to be a result of  external insults beyond the control of those experiencing the stress. More recently, however, it has been argued that external circumstances do not have any intrinsic capacity to produce stress, but instead their effect is mediated by the individual's perceptions, capacities, and understanding.\n【5】 # Models of stress management\n【6】 ## Transactional model\n【7】 Richard Lazarus and Susan Folkman suggested in 1984 that stress can be thought of as resulting from an “imbalance between demands and resources” or as occurring when “pressure exceeds one's perceived ability to cope”. Stress management was developed and premised on the idea that stress is not a direct response to a stressor but rather one's resources and ability to cope mediate the stress response and are amenable to change, thus allowing stress to be controllable.\n【8】 In order to develop an effective stress management programme it is first necessary to identify the factors that are central to a person controlling his/her stress, and to identify the intervention methods which effectively target these factors. Lazarus and Folkman's interpretation of stress focuses on the transaction between people and their external environment (known as the Transactional Model). The model conceptualizes stress as a result of how a stressor is appraised and how a person appraises his/her resources to cope with the stressor. The model breaks the stressor-stress link by proposing that if stressors are perceived as positive or challenging rather than a threat, and if the stressed person is confident that he/she possesses adequate rather than deficient coping strategies, stress may not necessarily follow the presence of a potential stressor. The model proposes that stress can be reduced by helping stressed people change their perceptions of stressors, providing them with strategies to help them cope and improving their confidence in their ability to do so.\n【9】 ## Health realization/innate health model\n【10】 The health realization/innate health model of stress is also founded on the idea that stress does not necessarily follow the presence of a potential stressor.  Instead of focusing on the individual's appraisal of so-called stressors in relation to his or her own coping skills (as the transactional model does), the health realization model focuses on the nature of thought, stating that it is ultimately a person's thought processes that determine the response to potentially stressful external circumstances.  In this model, stress results from appraising oneself and one's circumstances through a mental filter of insecurity and negativity, whereas a feeling of well-being results from approaching the world with a \"quiet mind,\" \"inner wisdom,\" and \"common sense\".\n【11】 This model proposes that helping stressed individuals understand the nature of thought--especially providing them with the ability to recognize when they are in the grip of insecure thinking, disengage from it, and access natural positive feelings--will  reduce their stress.\n【12】 # Techniques of stress management\n【13】 There are several ways of coping with stress.  Some techniques of time management may help a person to control stress.  In the face of high demands, effective stress management involves learning to set limits and to say \"No\" to some demands that others make.  Techniques of stress management will vary according to the theoretical paradigm adhered to, but may include some of the following:\n【14】 - Autogenic training\n【15】 - Cognitive therapy\n【16】 - Conflict resolution\n【17】 - Exercise\n【18】 - Meditation\n【19】 - Nootropics\n【20】 - Relaxation techniques\n【21】 Fractional relaxation\n【22】 Progressive relaxation\n【23】 Stress balls\n【24】 - Fractional relaxation\n【25】 - Progressive relaxation\n【26】 - Stress balls\n【27】 - Sexual intercourse\n【28】 - Time management\n【29】 - Listening to certain types of relaxing music, particularly:\n【30】 New Age music\n【31】 Classical music\n【32】 - New Age music\n【33】 - Classical music\n【34】 ## Measuring stress\n【35】 Levels of stress can be measured. One way is through the use of the Holmes and Rahe Stress Scale to rate stressful life events. Changes in blood pressure and galvanic skin response can also be measured to test stress levels, and changes in stress levels.  A digital thermometer can be used to evaluate changes in skin temperature, which can indicate activation of the fight or flight response drawing blood away from the extremities.\n【36】 Stress management has physiological and immune benefit effects. \n【37】 ## Effectiveness of Stress Management\n【38】 Positive outcomes are observed using a combination of non-drug interventions:\n【39】 - treatment of anger or hostility,\n【40】 - Autogenic Training\n【41】 - talking therapy (around relationship or existential issues)\n【42】 - biofeedback\n【43】 - cognitive therapy for anxiety or clinical depression", "title": "Stress management", "tags": "", "lang": "", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"https://www.wikidoc.org/index.php/Stress_management\", \"id\": \"97b4fe63eb453e533adb4c4a15e51611882aaa76\", \"source\": \"wikidoc\", \"overview\": \"None\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-01-28 23:07:59", "update_time": "2024-01-28 23:50:02"}

The species may also live on other areas with hair, including the eyelashes, causing pediculosis ciliaris. Infestation usually leads to intense itching in the pubic area. Treatment with topic agents such as permethrin or pyrethrin with piperonyl butoxide is exceedingly effective. Worldwide it affects about 2% of the population.\n【4】 # Historical Perspective\n【5】 - Pediculosis pubis was reported in the literature as early as 1946.\n【6】 - In 1946, Andrew G. Franks describes the use of DDT in the treatment of pediculosis pubis.\n【7】 # Classification\n【8】 Infestation with pubic lice may be classified according to the site affected into:\n【9】 - Phthiriasis pubis: infestation of pubic hair with pubic lice\n【10】 - Phthiriasis palpebrarum: infestation of eyelashes with pubic lice\n【11】 # Pathophysiology\n【12】 ## Transmission\n【13】 Pubic lice are usually acquired by intimate contact between individuals. Parent-to-child infestations are more likely to occur through routes of shared towels, clothing, beds or closets. Adults are more frequently infested than children. As with most sexually transmitted pathogens, they can only survive a short time away from the warmth and humidity of the human body. Infection in a young child is not necessarily indicative of sexual abuse, although this possibility should be kept in mind.\n【14】 ## Life Cycle\n【15】 Pubic lice (Phthirus pubis) have three stages: egg, nymph and adult. Eggs (nits) are laid on a hair shaft. Females will lay approximately 30 eggs during their 3–4 week life span. Eggs hatch after about a week and become nymphs, which look like smaller versions of the adults. The nymphs undergo three molts  before becoming adults. Adults are 1.5–2.0 mm long and flattened. They are much broader in comparison to head and body lice. Adult lice are found only on the human host and require human blood to survive. If adults are forced off the host, they will die within 24–48 hours without a blood feeding. Pubic lice are transmitted from person to person most-commonly via sexual contact, although fomites (bedding, clothing) may play a minor role in their transmission.\n【16】 ## Macroscopic Characteristics\n【17】 Pubic lice have three forms: the egg (also called a nit), the nymph, and the adult.\n【18】 - Nit: Nits are lice eggs. They can be hard to see and are found firmly attached to the hair shaft. They are oval and usually yellow to white.\n【19】 - Nymph: The nymph is an immature louse that hatches from the nit (egg). A nymph looks like an adult pubic louse but it is smaller. To live, a nymph must feed on blood. It takes 2–3 weeks after hatching to mature into adults capable of reproducing.\n【20】 - Adult: The adult pubic louse resembles a miniature crab when viewed through a strong magnifying glass. Pubic lice have six legs; their two front legs are very large and look like the pincher claws of a crab. This is how they got the nickname \"crabs.\" Pubic lice are tan to grayish-white in color. Females lay nits and are usually larger than males. To live, lice must feed on blood. If the louse falls off a person, it dies within 1–2 days.\n【21】 # Causes\n【22】 The cause of pubic lice is pediculus pubis. For more information about the microorganism, click here.\n【23】 # Differentiating Pediculosis pubis from other Diseases\n【24】 Pediculosis pubis must be differentiated from other diseases that cause pruritus and excoriation in the pubic area:\n【25】 # Epidemiology and Demographics\n【26】 - The incidence of pubic lice worldwide is estimated at 2,000 per 100,000 cases.\n【27】 - Accurate numbers are difficult to acquire, because pubic lice infestations are not considered a reportable condition by many governments, and many cases are self-treated or treated discreetly by personal physicians.\n【28】 - It has recently been suggested that an increasing percentage of humans removing their pubic hair has led to  reduced crab louse populations in some parts of the world.\n【29】 # Risk Factors\n【30】 Sexual contact with a person infected with pubic lice is a risk factor for its transmission.\n【31】 # Natural History, Complications and Prognosis\n【32】 ## Natural History\n【33】 If left untreated, infestation with pubic lice may persist and lead to secondary bacterial infection due to the associated intense itching.\n【34】 ## Complications\n【35】 Most common complication of pubic lice infestation is excoriations due to intense itching, which may lead to a secondary bacterial infection. When pediculus pubis infests the eyelashes, it may lead to eye infections, such as blepharitis and conjunctivitis.\n【36】 ## Prognosis\n【37】 With proper medical treatment with antimicrobial drugs, pediculosis pubis has an excellent prognosis.\n【38】 # Screening\n【39】 There are no screening recommendations for pubic lice. \n【40】 # History and Symptoms\n【41】 - Although any part of the body may be colonized, crab lice favor the hairs of the genital and peri-anal region. Especially in male patients, pubic lice and eggs can also be found in hair on the abdomen and under the armpits as well as on the beard and mustache, while in children they are usually found in eyelashes. Infestation with pubic lice is called Phthiriasis or Pediculosis pubis, while infestation of eyelashes with pubic lice is called Phthriasis palpebrarum .\n【42】 - The main symptom is itching, usually in the pubic hair area. It results from hypersensitivity to louse saliva, and it becomes strong enough 2 or more weeks following initial infestation.\n【43】 - Erythematous sore lesions may be seen due to scratching.\n【44】 - In the majority of infestations, a characteristic grey-blue or slate coloration appears (maculae caeruleae) at the feeding site, which may last for days and is also characteristic for the infestation.\n【45】 # Physical Examination\n【46】 Skin examination in patients with pubic lice may reveal the following findings:\n【47】 - Visualization of the pubic lice and their nits in the pubic area. Other sites that may be affected include the perianal and inguinal areas, axillary and chest hair, as well as the eyelashes.\n【48】 - Papular urticaria\n【49】 - Excoriations, which may become secondarily infected\n【50】 - Maculae cerulea: a pathognomonic finding for pubic lice. These are blue-gray, irregularly shaped macules, which measure 0.5-1 cm in diameter and are usually scattered over the lower abdomen, buttocks and upper thighs.\n【51】 - Inguinal lymphadenopathy\n【52】 - Fig.1 Pubic lice in abdomen - By KostaMumcuoglu at the English language Wikipedia, CC BY-SA 3.0, \n【53】 - Fig.3 Pubic lice on eye-lashes - By KostaMumcuoglu at the English language Wikipedia, CC BY-SA 3.0, \n【54】 Fig.3 Pubic lice on eye-lashes - By KostaMumcuoglu at the English language Wikipedia, CC BY-SA 3.0, \n【55】 # Laboratory Findings\n【56】 The diagnosis of pubic lice is made by visualization of lice on pubic hair and there are no laboratory findings associated with pubic lice.\n【57】 # Other Diagnostic Studies\n【58】 Diagnosis of pediculosis pubis is made through direct visualization of the lice on pubic hair.\n【59】 # Medical Therapy\n【60】 - Generally, all patients with Pediculosis pubis require antimicrobial therapy.\n【61】 - Randomized clinical data that compares the efficacy and safety of antimicrobial therapies is scarce.\n【62】 - The majority of trials that evaluate therapies for Pediculosis pubis are based on the management of head lice.\n【63】 - Phthirus pubis therapy\n【64】 - Preferred regimen (1): Permethrin 1% cream rinse applied to affected areas and washed off after 10 minutes\n【65】 - Preferred regimen (2): Pyrethrin with piperonyl butoxide applied to the affected area and washed off after 10 minutes\n【66】 - Alternative regimen (1): Malathion 0.5% lotion applied to affected areas and washed off after 8–12 hours\n【67】 - Alternative regimen (2): Ivermectin 250 ug/kg PO, may be repeated in 1-2 weeks\n【68】 - Note (1): If Malathion lotion is to be applied to hair, the hair should be dry. In contrast, Permethrin should be applied to wet hair.\n【69】 - Note (2): If necessary, treatment may be repeated after 1 week.\n【70】 - Note (3): Permethrin may be safe among pregnant women, but randomized data is lacking.\n【71】 ## Specific Considerations\n【72】 ### Eyelashes\n【73】 Recommended regimens should not be applied to the eyes. Apply occlusive ophthalmic ointment or petroleum jelly to the eyelid margins 2 times/day for 10 days\n【74】 ### Pregnancy\n【75】 - Preferred regimen (1): Permethrin 1% cream rinse applied to affected areas and washed off after 10 minutes\n【76】 - Preferred regimen (2): Pyrethrin with piperonyl butoxide applied to the affected area and washed off after 10 minutes\n【77】 - Ivermectin may be used. No teratogenicity has been observed so far in humans, so it remains as low risk during pregnancy and probably compatible during breastfeeding. Despite that, give preference to the other drugs.\n【78】 ## Non-Pharmacologic Management\n【79】 - Clothes should be decontaminated by laundering at temperatures > 50 C.\n【80】 ## Treatment of Sexual Partners\n【81】 - Pubic lice may be spread through sexual intercourse.\n【82】 - Therefore, all partners with whom the patient has had sexual contact within the previous 30 days should be evaluated and treated, and sexual contact should be avoided until all partners have successfully completed treatment and are thought to be cured.\n【83】 - Because of the strong association between the presence of pubic lice and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), patients diagnosed with pubic lice should undergo evaluation for other STIs.\n【84】 # Surgery\n【85】 There is no role for surgery in the treatment of pubic lice.\n【86】 # Primary Prevention\n【87】 Abstaining from sexual intercourse with an infected person is one of the means of preventing infestation with pubic lice.\n【88】 # Secondary Prevention\n【89】 Once a patient is diagnosed with pubic lice, the following preventive measures may be followed:\n【90】 - Washing with hot water and drying of all clothes and bedding\n【91】 - Promoting personal hygiene and sanitation measures\n【92】 - Treatment of sexual contacts with pubic lice\n【93】 - Examining patients and their sexual partners for other STDs.", "title": "Pediculosis pubis", "tags": "", "lang": "", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"https://www.wikidoc.org/index.php/Crab_lice\", \"id\": \"ac96f0a759279dab862c1ec7a0321767cd1530cf\", \"source\": \"wikidoc\", \"overview\": \"None\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"type3": "", "type6": "信息不完整#51#54#无图片数据"}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-01-28 23:07:59", "update_time": "2024-02-18 22:40:17"}

Capsules of EMEND 80 mg should be administered on Days 2 and 3. EMEND for Injection 115 mg should be administered in conjunction with a corticosteroid and a 5-HT3 antagonist as specified in Table 3. The recommended dosage of dexamethasone with EMEND for Injection 115 mg differs from the recommended dosage of dexamethasone with EMEND for Injection 150 mg on Days 3 and 4. The package insert for the co-administered 5-HT3 antagonist must be consulted prior to initiation of treatment with EMEND for Injection.\n【24】 - Capsules of EMEND 125 mg may be substituted for EMEND for Injection 115 mg on Day 1.\n【25】 Preparation of EMEND for Injection\n【26】 - The reconstituted final drug solution is stable for 24 hours at ambient room temperature (at or below 25°C).\n【27】 - Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration before administration whenever solution and container permit.\n【28】 - Caution: EMEND for Injection should not be mixed or reconstituted with solutions for which physical and chemical compatibility have not been established. EMEND for Injection is incompatible with any solutions containing divalent cations (e.g., Ca2+, Mg2+), including Lactated Ringer's Solution and Hartmann's Solution.\n【29】 # DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS\n【30】 - One 150-mg single dose glass vial: White to off-white lyophilized solid (Sterile lyophilized powder for intravenous use only after reconstitution and dilution).\n【31】 - One 115-mg single dose glass vial: White to off-white lyophilized solid (Sterile lyophilized powder for intravenous use only after reconstitution and dilution).\n【32】 ## Off-Label Use and Dosage (Adult)\n【33】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\n【34】 There is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Fosaprepitant in adult patients.\n【35】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n【36】 There is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Fosaprepitant in adult patients.\n【37】 # Pediatric Indications and Dosage\n【38】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Pediatric)\n【39】 There is limited information regarding FDA-Labeled Use of Fosaprepitant in pediatric patients.\n【40】 ## Off-Label Use and Dosage (Pediatric)\n【41】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\n【42】 There is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Fosaprepitant in pediatric patients.\n【43】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n【44】 There is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Fosaprepitant in pediatric patients.\n【45】 # Contraindications\n【46】 Hypersensitivity\n【47】 - EMEND for Injection is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to EMEND for Injection, aprepitant, polysorbate 80 or any other components of the product. Known hypersensitivity reactions include: flushing, erythema, dyspnea, and anaphylactic reactions.\n【48】 Concomitant Use with Pimozide or Cisapride\n【49】 - Aprepitant, when administered orally, is a moderate cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitor following the 3-day antiemetic dosing regimen for CINV. Since fosaprepitant is rapidly converted to aprepitant, do not use fosaprepitant concurrently with pimozide or cisapride. Inhibition of CYP3A4 by aprepitant could result in elevated plasma concentrations of these drugs, potentially causing serious or life-threatening reactions.\n【50】 # Warnings\n【51】 CYP3A4 Interactions\n【52】 - Fosaprepitant is rapidly converted to aprepitant, which is a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4 when administered as a 3-day antiemetic dosing regimen for CINV. Fosaprepitant should be used with caution in patients receiving concomitant medications that are primarily metabolized through CYP3A4. Inhibition of CYP3A4 by aprepitant or fosaprepitant could result in elevated plasma concentrations of these concomitant medications. When fosaprepitant is used concomitantly with another CYP3A4 inhibitor, aprepitant plasma concentrations could be elevated. When aprepitant is used concomitantly with medications that induce CYP3A4 activity, aprepitant plasma concentrations could be reduced, and this may result in decreased efficacy of aprepitant.\n【53】 - Chemotherapy agents that are known to be metabolized by CYP3A4 include docetaxel, paclitaxel, etoposide, irinotecan, ifosfamide, imatinib, vinorelbine, vinblastine and vincristine. In clinical studies, the oral aprepitant regimen was administered commonly with etoposide, vinorelbine, or paclitaxel. The doses of these agents were not adjusted to account for potential drug interactions.\n【54】 - In separate pharmacokinetic studies, no clinically significant change in docetaxel or vinorelbine pharmacokinetics was observed when the oral aprepitant regimen was coadministered.\n【55】 - Due to the small number of patients in clinical studies who received the CYP3A4 substrates vinblastine, vincristine, or ifosfamide, particular caution and careful monitoring are advised in patients receiving these agents or other chemotherapy agents metabolized primarily by CYP3A4 that were not studied.\n【56】 Hypersensitivity Reactions\n【57】 - Isolated reports of immediate hypersensitivity reactions including flushing, erythema, dyspnea, and anaphylaxis have occurred during infusion of fosaprepitant. These hypersensitivity reactions have generally responded to discontinuation of the infusion and administration of appropriate therapy. Reinitiation of the infusion is not recommended in patients who experience these symptoms during first-time use.\n【58】 Coadministration with Warfarin (a CYP2C9 substrate)\n【59】 - Coadministration of fosaprepitant or aprepitant with warfarin may result in a clinically significant decrease in International Normalized Ratio (INR) of prothrombin time. In patients on chronic warfarin therapy, the INR should be closely monitored in the 2-week period, particularly at 7 to 10 days, following initiation of fosaprepitant with each chemotherapy cycle.\n【60】 Coadministration with Hormonal Contraceptives\n【61】 - Upon coadministration with fosaprepitant or aprepitant, the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives may be reduced during and for 28 days following the last dose of either fosaprepitant or aprepitant. Alternative or back-up methods of contraception should be used during treatment with and for 1 month following the last dose of fosaprepitant or aprepitant.\n【62】 Chronic Continuous Use\n【63】 - Chronic continuous use of EMEND for Injection for prevention of nausea and vomiting is not recommended because it has not been studied; and because the drug interaction profile may change during chronic continuous use.\n【64】 # Adverse Reactions\n【65】 ## Clinical Trials Experience\n【66】 Clinical Trials Experience\n【67】 - Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.\n【68】 - Since EMEND for Injection is converted to aprepitant, those adverse reactions associated with aprepitant might also be expected to occur with EMEND for Injection.\n【69】 - The overall safety of fosaprepitant was evaluated in approximately 1100 individuals and the overall safety of aprepitant was evaluated in approximately 6500 individuals.\n【70】 Oral Aprepitant\n【71】 Highly Emetogenic Chemotherapy (HEC)\n【72】 - In 2 well-controlled clinical trials in patients receiving highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, 544 patients were treated with aprepitant during Cycle 1 of chemotherapy and 413 of these patients continued into the Multiple-Cycle extension for up to 6 cycles of chemotherapy. Oral aprepitant was given in combination with ondansetron and dexamethasone.\n【73】 - In Cycle 1, adverse reactions were reported in approximately 17% of patients treated with the aprepitant regimen compared with approximately 13% of patients treated with standard therapy. Treatment was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 0.6% of patients treated with the aprepitant regimen compared with 0.4% of patients treated with standard therapy.\n【74】 - The most common adverse reactions reported in patients treated with the aprepitant regimen with an incidence ≥1% and greater than standard therapy are listed in Table 5.\n【75】 - A listing of adverse reactions in the aprepitant regimen (incidence <1%) that occurred at a greater incidence than standard therapy are presented in the Less Common Adverse Reactions subsection below.\n【76】 - In an additional active-controlled clinical study in 1169 patients receiving aprepitant and highly emetogenic chemotherapy, the adverse experience profile was generally similar to that seen in the other HEC studies with aprepitant.\n【77】 Moderately Emetogenic Chemotherapy (MEC)\n【78】 - In 2 well-controlled clinical trials in patients receiving moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, 868 patients were treated with the aprepitant regimen during Cycle 1 of chemotherapy and 686 of these patients continued into extensions for up to 4 cycles of chemotherapy. In both studies, oral aprepitant was given in combination with ondansetron and dexamethasone (aprepitant regimen).\n【79】 - In the combined analysis of Cycle 1 data for these 2 studies, adverse reactions were reported in approximately 14% of patients treated with the aprepitant regimen compared with approximately 15% of patients treated with standard therapy. Treatment was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 0.7% of patients treated with the aprepitant regimen compared with 0.2% of patients treated with standard therapy.\n【80】 - The most common adverse reactions reported in patients treated with the aprepitant regimen with an incidence ≥1% and greater than standard therapy are listed in Table 6.\n【81】 - A listing of adverse reactions in the aprepitant regimen (incidence <1%) that occurred at a greater incidence than standard therapy are presented in the Less Common Adverse Reactions subsection below.\n【82】 Less Common Adverse Reactions\n【83】 Adverse reactions reported in either HEC or MEC studies in patients treated with the - aprepitant regimen with an incidence <1% and greater than standard therapy are listed in Table 7.\n【84】 - In another chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) study, Stevens-Johnson syndrome was reported as a serious adverse reaction in a patient receiving aprepitant with cancer chemotherapy.\n【85】 - The adverse experience profiles in the Multiple-Cycle extensions of HEC and MEC studies for up to 6 cycles of chemotherapy were similar to that observed in Cycle 1.\n【86】 Fosaprepitant\n【87】 - In an active-controlled clinical study in patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy, safety was evaluated for 1143 patients receiving the 1-day regimen of EMEND for Injection 150 mg compared to 1169 patients receiving the 3-day regimen of EMEND (aprepitant). The safety profile was generally similar to that seen in prior HEC studies with aprepitant. However, infusion-site reactions occurred at a higher incidence in patients in the fosaprepitant group (3.0%) compared to those in the aprepitant group (0.5%). The reported infusion-site reactions included infusion-site erythema, infusion-site pruritus, infusion-site pain, infusion-site induration, and infusion-site thrombophlebitis.\n【88】 - The following additional adverse reactions occurred with fosaprepitant 150 mg and were not reported with the oral aprepitant regimen in the corresponding section above.\n【89】 Other Studies with Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting\n【90】 - In well-controlled clinical studies in patients receiving general balanced anesthesia, 564 patients were administered 40-mg aprepitant orally and 538 patients were administered 4-mg ondansetron intravenously.\n【91】 - Adverse reactions were reported in approximately 4% of patients treated with 40-mg aprepitant compared with approximately 6% of patients treated with 4-mg ondansetron intravenously.\n【92】 - In patients treated with aprepitant, increased ALT (1.1%) was seen at a greater incidence than with ondansetron (1.0%). The following additional adverse reactions were observed in patients treated with aprepitant at an incidence <1% and greater than with ondansetron.\n【93】 n addition, two serious adverse reactions were reported in postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) clinical studies in patients taking a higher dose of aprepitant: one case of constipation, and one case of subileus.\n【94】 Other Studies\n【95】 - Angioedema and urticaria were reported as serious adverse reactions in a patient receiving aprepitant in a non-CINV/non-PONV study.\n【96】 ## Postmarketing Experience\n【97】 - The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of fosaprepitant and aprepitant. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.\n【98】 - Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: pruritus, rash, urticaria, rarely Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis.\n【99】 - Immune system disorders: hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions.\n【100】 - Nervous system disorders: Events of ifosfamide-induced neurotoxicity have been reported after aprepitant and ifosfamide coadministration.\n【101】 # Drug Interactions\n【102】 - Drug interactions following administration of fosaprepitant are likely to occur with drugs that interact with oral aprepitant.\n【103】 - Aprepitant is a substrate, a moderate inhibitor, and an inducer of CYP3A4 when administered as a 3-day antiemetic dosing regimen for CINV. Aprepitant is also an inducer of CYP2C9.\n【104】 - Fosaprepitant 150 mg, given as a single dose, is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4, and does not induce CYP3A4. Fosaprepitant or aprepitant is unlikely to interact with drugs that are substrates for the P-glycoprotein transporter.\n【105】 - The following information was derived from data with oral aprepitant, two studies conducted with fosaprepitant and oral midazolam, and one study conducted with fosaprepitant and dexamethasone.\n【106】 Effect of Fosaprepitant/Aprepitant on the Pharmacokinetics of Other Agents\n【107】 CYP3A4 substrates:\n【108】 - Aprepitant, as a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4, and fosaprepitant 150 mg, as a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4, can increase plasma concentrations of concomitantly coadministered oral medications that are metabolized through CYP3A4.\n【109】 5-HT3 antagonists:\n【110】 - In clinical drug interaction studies, aprepitant did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron, granisetron, or hydrodolasetron (the active metabolite of dolasetron).\n【111】 Corticosteroids:\n【112】 - Dexamethasone: Fosaprepitant 150 mg administered as a single intravenous dose on Day 1 increased the AUC0-24hr of dexamethasone, administered as a single 8-mg oral dose on Days 1, 2, and 3, by approximately 2-fold on Days 1 and 2. The oral dexamethasone dose on Days 1 and 2 should be reduced by approximately 50% when coadministered with fosaprepitant 150-mg intravenous on Day 1.\n【113】 - An oral aprepitant regimen of 125 mg on Day 1, and 80 mg/day on Days 2 through 5, coadministered with 20-mg oral dexamethasone on Day 1 and 8-mg oral dexamethasone on Days 2 through 5, increased the AUC of dexamethasone by 2.2-fold on Days 1 and 5. The oral dexamethasone doses should be reduced by approximately 50% when coadministered with a regimen of fosaprepitant 115 mg followed by aprepitant.\n【114】 - Methylprednisolone: An oral aprepitant regimen of 125 mg on Day 1 and 80 mg/day on Days 2 and 3 increased the AUC of methylprednisolone by 1.34-fold on Day 1 and by 2.5-fold on Day 3, when methylprednisolone was coadministered intravenously as 125 mg on Day 1 and orally as 40 mg on Days 2 and 3. The intravenous methylprednisolone dose should be reduced by approximately 25%, and the oral methylprednisolone dose should be reduced by approximately 50% when coadministered with a regimen of fosaprepitant 115 mg followed by aprepitant.\n【115】 Chemotherapeutic agents:\n【116】 - Docetaxel: In a pharmacokinetic study, oral aprepitant (CINV regimen) did not influence the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel.\n【117】 - Vinorelbine: In a pharmacokinetic study, oral aprepitant (CINV regimen) did not influence the pharmacokinetics of vinorelbine to a clinically significant degree.\n【118】 - Other Chemotherapeutic Agents: EMEND for Injection should be used with caution in patients receiving other chemotherapeutic agents that are primarily metabolized through CYP3A4.\n【119】 Oral contraceptives:\n【120】 - When oral aprepitant, ondansetron, and dexamethasone were coadministered with an oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone, the trough concentrations of both ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone were reduced by as much as 64% for 3 weeks post-treatment.\n【121】 - The coadministration of fosaprepitant or aprepitant may reduce the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives (these can include birth control pills, skin patches, implants, and certain IUDs) during and for 28 days after administration of the last dose of fosaprepitant or aprepitant. Alternative or back-up methods of contraception should be used during treatment with and for 1 month following the last dose of fosaprepitant or aprepitant.\n【122】 Midazolam:\n【123】 - Interactions between aprepitant or fosaprepitant and coadministered midazolam are listed in the table below (increase is indicated as \"↑\", decrease as \"↓\", no change as \"↔\").\n【124】 - A difference of less than 2-fold increase of midazolam AUC was not considered clinically important.\n【125】 - The potential effects of increased plasma concentrations of midazolam or other benzodiazepines metabolized via CYP3A4 (alprazolam, triazolam) should be considered when coadministering these agents with fosaprepitant or aprepitant.\n【126】 CYP2C9 substrates (Warfarin, Tolbutamide):\n【127】 - Warfarin: A single 125-mg dose of oral aprepitant was administered on Day 1 and 80 mg/day on Days 2 and 3 to healthy subjects who were stabilized on chronic warfarin therapy. Although there was no effect of oral aprepitant on the plasma AUC of R(+) or S(-) warfarin determined on Day 3, there was a 34% decrease in S(-) warfarin trough concentration accompanied by a 14% decrease in the prothrombin time (reported as International Normalized Ratio or INR) 5 days after completion of dosing with oral aprepitant. In patients on chronic warfarin therapy, the prothrombin time (INR) should be closely monitored in the 2-week period, particularly at 7 to 10 days, following initiation of fosaprepitant with each chemotherapy cycle.\n【128】 - Tolbutamide: Oral aprepitant, when given as 125 mg on Day 1 and 80 mg/day on Days 2 and 3, decreased the AUC of tolbutamide by 23% on Day 4, 28% on Day 8, and 15% on Day 15, when a single dose of tolbutamide 500 mg was administered orally prior to the administration of the 3-day regimen of oral aprepitant and on Days 4, 8, and 15.\n【129】 ## Effect of Other Agents on the Pharmacokinetics of Aprepitant\n【130】 - Aprepitant is a substrate for CYP3A4; therefore, coadministration of fosaprepitant or aprepitant with drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 activity may result in increased plasma concentrations of aprepitant. Consequently, concomitant administration of fosaprepitant or aprepitant with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, nefazodone, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, nelfinavir) should be approached with caution. Because moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., diltiazem) result in a 2-fold increase in plasma concentrations of aprepitant, concomitant administration should also be approached with caution.\n【131】 - Aprepitant is a substrate for CYP3A4; therefore, coadministration of fosaprepitant or aprepitant with drugs that strongly induce CYP3A4 activity (e.g., rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin) may result in reduced plasma concentrations and decreased efficacy.\n【132】 - Ketoconazole: When a single 125-mg dose of oral aprepitant was administered on Day 5 of a 10-day regimen of 400 mg/day of ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, the AUC of aprepitant increased approximately 5-fold and the mean terminal half-life of aprepitant increased approximately 3-fold. Concomitant administration of fosaprepitant or aprepitant with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors should be approached cautiously.\n【133】 - Rifampin: When a single 375-mg dose of oral aprepitant was administered on Day 9 of a 14-day regimen of 600 mg/day of rifampin, a strong CYP3A4 inducer, the AUC of aprepitant decreased approximately 11-fold and the mean terminal half-life decreased approximately 3-fold.\n【134】 - Coadministration of fosaprepitant or aprepitant with drugs that induce CYP3A4 activity may result in reduced plasma concentrations and decreased efficacy.\n【135】 ## Additional Interactions\n【136】 Diltiazem:\n【137】 - In a study in 10 patients with mild to moderate hypertension, intravenous infusion of 100 mg of fosaprepitant with diltiazem 120 mg 3 times daily, resulted in a 1.5-fold increase of aprepitant AUC and a 1.4-fold increase in diltiazem AUC. It also resulted in a small but clinically meaningful further maximum decrease in diastolic blood pressure  and resulted in a small further maximum decrease in systolic blood pressure , which may be clinically meaningful, but did not result in a clinically meaningful further change in heart rate or PR interval, beyond those changes induced by diltiazem alone.\n【138】 - In the same study, administration of aprepitant once daily, as a tablet formulation comparable to 230 mg of the capsule formulation, with diltiazem 120 mg 3 times daily for 5 days, resulted in a 2-fold increase of aprepitant AUC and a simultaneous 1.7-fold increase of diltiazem AUC. These pharmacokinetic effects did not result in clinically meaningful changes in ECG, heart rate or blood pressure beyond those changes induced by diltiazem alone.\n【139】 Paroxetine:\n【140】 - Coadministration of once daily doses of aprepitant, as a tablet formulation comparable to 85 mg or 170 mg of the capsule formulation, with paroxetine 20 mg once daily, resulted in a decrease in AUC by approximately 25% and Cmax by approximately 20% of both aprepitant and paroxetine.\n【141】 # Use in Specific Populations\n【142】 ### Pregnancy\n【143】 Pregnancy Category (FDA): \n【144】 Teratogenic effects\n【145】 Pregnancy Category B: In the reproduction studies conducted with fosaprepitant and aprepitant, the highest systemic exposures to aprepitant were obtained following oral administration of aprepitant. Reproduction studies performed in rats at oral doses of aprepitant up to 1000 mg/kg twice daily (plasma AUC0-24hr of 31.3 mcghr/mL, about 1.6 times the human exposure at the recommended dose) and in rabbits at oral doses up to 25 mg/kg/day (plasma AUC0-24hr of 26.9 mcghr/mL, about 1.4 times the human exposure at the recommended dose) revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to aprepitant. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.\n【146】 Pregnancy Category (AUS):\n【147】 - Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) Pregnancy Category\n【148】 There is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Fosaprepitant in women who are pregnant.\n【149】 ### Labor and Delivery\n【150】 There is no FDA guidance on use of Fosaprepitant during labor and delivery.\n【151】 ### Nursing Mothers\n【152】 - Aprepitant is excreted in the milk of rats. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for possible serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from aprepitant and because of the potential for tumorigenicity shown for aprepitant in rodent carcinogenicity studies, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\n【153】 ### Pediatric Use\n【154】 - Safety and effectiveness of EMEND for Injection in pediatric patients have not been established.\n【155】 ### Geriatic Use\n【156】 - In 2 well-controlled chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting clinical studies, of the total number of patients (N=544) treated with oral aprepitant, 31% were 65 and over, while 5% were 75 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects. Greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Dosage adjustment in the elderly is not necessary\n【157】 ### Gender\n【158】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of Fosaprepitant with respect to specific gender populations.\n【159】 ### Race\n【160】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of Fosaprepitant with respect to specific racial populations.\n【161】 ### Renal Impairment\n【162】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of Fosaprepitant in patients with renal impairment.\n【163】 ### Hepatic Impairment\n【164】 - There are no clinical or pharmacokinetic data in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score >9). Therefore, caution should be exercised when fosaprepitant or aprepitant is administered in these patients\n【165】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\n【166】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of Fosaprepitant in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n【167】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\n【168】 There is no FDA guidance one the use of Fosaprepitant in patients who are immunocompromised.\n【169】 # Administration and Monitoring\n【170】 ### Administration\n【171】 - Intravenous\n【172】 ### Monitoring\n【173】 - There is limited information regarding Monitoring of Fosaprepitant in the drug label.\n【174】 # IV Compatibility\n【175】 - There is limited information regarding IV Compatibility of Fosaprepitant in the drug label.\n【176】 # Overdosage\n【177】 - There is no specific information on the treatment of overdosage with fosaprepitant or aprepitant.\n【178】 - In the event of overdose, fosaprepitant and/or oral aprepitant should be discontinued and general supportive treatment and monitoring should be provided. Because of the antiemetic activity of aprepitant, drug-induced emesis may not be effective.\n【179】 - Aprepitant cannot be removed by hemodialysis.\n【180】 - Thirteen patients in the randomized controlled trial of EMEND for Injection received both fosaprepitant 150 mg and at least one dose of oral aprepitant, 125 mg or 80 mg. Three patients reported adverse reactions that were similar to those experienced by the total study population.\n【181】 # Pharmacology\n【182】 ## Mechanism of Action\n【183】 - Fosaprepitant is a prodrug of aprepitant and accordingly, its antiemetic effects are attributable to aprepitant.\n【184】 - Aprepitant is a selective high-affinity antagonist of human substance P/neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptors. Aprepitant has little or no affinity for serotonin (5-HT3), dopamine, and corticosteroid receptors, the targets of existing therapies for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). Aprepitant has been shown in animal models to inhibit emesis induced by cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents, such as cisplatin, via central actions. Animal and human Positron Emission Tomography (PET) studies with aprepitant have shown that it crosses the blood brain barrier and occupies brain NK1 receptors. Animal and human studies show that aprepitant augments the antiemetic activity of the 5-HT3-receptor antagonist ondansetron and the corticosteroid dexamethasone and inhibits both the acute and delayed phases of cisplatin-induced emesis.\n【185】 ## Structure\n【186】 - EMEND (fosaprepitant dimeglumine) for Injection is a sterile, lyophilized prodrug of aprepitant, a substance P/neurokinin-1 (NK1) receptor antagonist, and is chemically described as 1-Deoxy-1-(methylamino)-D-glucitolmethyl-2,5-dihydro-5-oxo-1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-ylphosphonate (2:1) (salt).\n【187】 - Its empirical formula is C23H22F7N4O6P ∙ 2(C7H17NO5) and its structural formula is:\n【188】 - Fosaprepitant dimeglumine is a white to off-white amorphous powder with a molecular weight of 1004.83. It is freely soluble in water.\n【189】 - EMEND for Injection is a lyophilized prodrug of aprepitant containing polysorbate 80 (PS80), to be administered intravenously as an infusion.\n【190】 - Each vial of EMEND for Injection 115 mg for intravenous administration contains 188 mg of fosaprepitant dimeglumine equivalent to 115 mg of fosaprepitant free acid and the following inactive ingredients: edetate disodium (14.4 mg), polysorbate 80 (57.5 mg), lactose anhydrous (287.5 mg), sodium hydroxide and/or hydrochloric acid (for pH adjustment). Each vial of EMEND for Injection 150 mg for intravenous administration contains 245.3 mg of fosaprepitant dimeglumine equivalent to 150 mg of fosaprepitant free acid and the following inactive ingredients: edetate disodium (18.8 mg), polysorbate 80 (75 mg), lactose anhydrous (375 mg), sodium hydroxide and/or hydrochloric acid (for pH adjustment). Fosaprepitant dimeglumine hereafter will be referred to as fosaprepitant.\n【191】 ## Pharmacodynamics\n【192】 NK1 Receptor Occupancy\n【193】 - In two single-blind, multiple-dose, randomized, and placebo control studies, healthy young men received oral aprepitant doses of 10 mg (N=2), 30 mg (N=3), 100 mg (N=3) or 300 mg (N=5) once daily for 14 days with 2 or 3 subjects on placebo. Both plasma aprepitant concentration and NK1 receptor occupancy in the corpus striatum by positron emission tomography were evaluated, at predose and 24 hours after the last dose. At aprepitant plasma concentrations of ~10 ng/mL and ~100 ng/mL, the NK1 receptor occupancies were ~50% and ~90%, respectively. The oral aprepitant regimen for CINV produces mean trough plasma aprepitant concentrations >500 ng/mL, which would be expected to, based on the fitted curve with the Hill equation, result in >95% brain NK1 receptor occupancy. However, the receptor occupancy for either CINV or PONV dosing regimen has not been determined. In addition, the relationship between NK1 receptor occupancy and the clinical efficacy of aprepitant has not been established.\n【194】 Cardiac Electrophysiology\n【195】 - In a randomized, double-blind, positive-controlled, thorough QTc study, a single 200-mg dose of fosaprepitant had no effect on the QTc interval.\n【196】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n【197】 Aprepitant after Fosaprepitant Administration\n【198】 - Following a single intravenous 115-mg dose of fosaprepitant administered as a 15-minute infusion to healthy volunteers the mean AUC0-∞ of aprepitant was 31.7 (± 14.3) mcghr/mL and the mean maximal aprepitant concentration (Cmax) was 3.27 (± 1.16) mcg/mL. The mean aprepitant plasma concentration at 24 hours postdose was similar between the 125-mg oral aprepitant dose and the 115-mg intravenous fosaprepitant dose. (See Figure 1.)\n【199】 - Following a single, intravenous 150-mg dose of fosaprepitant administered as a 20-minute infusion to healthy volunteers, the mean AUC0-∞ of aprepitant was 37.38 (± 14.75) mcghr/mL and the mean maximal aprepitant concentration (Cmax) was 4.15 (± 1.15) mcg/mL.\n【200】 Distribution\n【201】 - Fosaprepitant is rapidly converted to aprepitant. Aprepitant is greater than 95% bound to plasma proteins. The mean apparent volume of distribution at steady state (Vdss) is approximately 70 L in humans.\n【202】 - Aprepitant crosses the placenta in rats and rabbits and crosses the blood brain barrier in humans.\n【203】 Metabolism\n【204】 - Fosaprepitant was rapidly converted to aprepitant in in vitro incubations with liver preparations from nonclinical species (rat and dog) and humans. Furthermore, fosaprepitant underwent rapid and nearly complete conversion to aprepitant in S9 preparations from multiple other human tissues including kidney, lung and ileum. Thus, it appears that the conversion of fosaprepitant to aprepitant can occur in multiple extrahepatic tissues in addition to the liver. In humans, fosaprepitant administered intravenously was rapidly converted to aprepitant within 30 minutes following the end of infusion.\n【205】 - Aprepitant undergoes extensive metabolism. In vitro studies using human liver microsomes indicate that aprepitant is metabolized primarily by CYP3A4 with minor metabolism by CYP1A2 and CYP2C19. Metabolism is largely via oxidation at the morpholine ring and its side chains. No metabolism by CYP2D6, CYP2C9, or CYP2E1 was detected. In healthy young adults, aprepitant accounts for approximately 24% of the radioactivity in plasma over 72 hours following a single oral 300-mg dose of -aprepitant, indicating a substantial presence of metabolites in the plasma. Seven metabolites of aprepitant, which are only weakly active, have been identified in human plasma.\n【206】 Excretion\n【207】 - Following administration of a single intravenous 100-mg dose of -fosaprepitant to healthy subjects, 57% of the radioactivity was recovered in urine and 45% in feces.\n【208】 - Aprepitant is eliminated primarily by metabolism; aprepitant is not renally excreted. The apparent terminal half-life ranged from approximately 9 to 13 hours.\n【209】 Specific Populations\n【210】 Gender\n【211】 - Following oral administration of a single dose of aprepitant, the AUC0-24hr and Cmax are 14% and 22% higher in females as compared with males. The half-life of aprepitant is 25% lower in females as compared with males and Tmax occurs at approximately the same time. These differences are not considered clinically meaningful. No dosage adjustment is necessary based on gender.\n【212】 Geriatric\n【213】 - Following oral administration of a single 125-mg dose of aprepitant on Day 1 and 80 mg once daily on Days 2 through 5, the AUC0-24hr of aprepitant was 21% higher on Day 1 and 36% higher on Day 5 in elderly (≥65 years) relative to younger adults. The Cmax was 10% higher on Day 1 and 24% higher on Day 5 in elderly relative to younger adults. These differences are not considered clinically meaningful. No dosage adjustment is necessary in elderly patients.\n【214】 Race\n【215】 - Following oral administration of a single dose of aprepitant, the AUC0-24hr and Cmax are approximately 42% and 29% higher in Hispanics as compared with Caucasians. The AUC0-24hr and Cmax are 62% and 41% higher in Asians as compared to Caucasians. There was no difference in AUC0-24hr or Cmax between Caucasians and Blacks. These differences are not considered clinically meaningful. No dosage adjustment is necessary based on race.\n【216】 Body Mass Index (BMI)\n【217】 - For every 5 kg/m2 increase in BMI, AUC0-24hr and Cmax of aprepitant decrease by 11%. BMI of subjects in the analysis ranged from 18 kg/m2 to 36 kg/m2. This change is not considered clinically meaningful. No dosage adjustment is necessary based on BMI.\n【218】 Hepatic Insufficiency\n【219】 - Fosaprepitant is metabolized in various extrahepatic tissues; therefore hepatic impairment is not expected to alter the conversion of fosaprepitant to aprepitant.\n【220】 - Following administration of a single 125-mg dose of oral aprepitant on Day 1 and 80 mg once daily on Days 2 and 3 to patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 5 to 6), the AUC0-24hr of aprepitant was 11% lower on Day 1 and 36% lower on Day 3, as compared with healthy subjects given the same regimen. In patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 7 to 9), the AUC0-24hr of aprepitant was 10% higher on Day 1 and 18% higher on Day 3, as compared with healthy subjects given the same regimen. These differences in AUC0-24hr are not considered clinically meaningful; therefore, no dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.\n【221】 - There are no clinical or pharmacokinetic data in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score >9).\n【222】 Renal Insufficiency\n【223】 - A single 240-mg dose of oral aprepitant was administered to patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 as measured by 24-hour urinary creatinine clearance) and to patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring hemodialysis.\n【224】 - In patients with severe renal impairment, the AUC0-∞ of total aprepitant (unbound and protein bound) decreased by 21% and Cmax decreased by 32%, relative to healthy subjects (creatinine clearance >80 mL/min estimated by Cockcroft-Gault method). In patients with ESRD undergoing hemodialysis, the AUC0-∞ of total aprepitant decreased by 42% and Cmax decreased by 32%. Due to modest decreases in protein binding of aprepitant in patients with renal disease, the AUC of pharmacologically active unbound drug was not significantly affected in patients with renal impairment compared with healthy subjects. Hemodialysis conducted 4 or 48 hours after dosing had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of aprepitant; less than 0.2% of the dose was recovered in the dialysate.\n【225】 - No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with renal impairment or for patients with ESRD undergoing hemodialysis.\n【226】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\n【227】 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\n【228】 - Carcinogenicity studies were conducted in Sprague-Dawley rats and in CD-1 mice for 2 years. In the rat carcinogenicity studies, animals were treated with oral doses ranging from 0.05 to 1000 mg/kg twice daily. The highest dose produced a systemic exposure to aprepitant (plasma AUC0-24hr) of 0.7 to 1.6 times the human exposure (AUC0-24hr = 19.6 mcghr/mL) at the recommended dose of 125 mg/day. Treatment with aprepitant at doses of 5 to 1000 mg/kg twice daily caused an increase in the incidences of thyroid follicular cell adenomas and carcinomas in male rats. In female rats, it produced hepatocellular adenomas at 5 to 1000 mg/kg twice daily and hepatocellular carcinomas and thyroid follicular cell adenomas at 125 to 1000 mg/kg twice daily. In the mouse carcinogenicity studies, the animals were treated with oral doses ranging from 2.5 to 2000 mg/kg/day. The highest dose produced a systemic exposure of about 2.8 to 3.6 times the human exposure at the recommended dose. Treatment with aprepitant produced skin fibrosarcomas at 125 and 500 mg/kg/day doses in male mice. Carcinogenicity studies were not conducted with fosaprepitant.\n【229】 - Aprepitant and fosaprepitant were not genotoxic in the Ames test, the human lymphoblastoid cell (TK6) mutagenesis test, the rat hepatocyte DNA strand break test, the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell chromosome aberration test and the mouse micronucleus test.\n【230】 - Fosaprepitant, when administered intravenously, is rapidly converted to aprepitant. In the fertility studies conducted with fosaprepitant and aprepitant, the highest systemic exposures to aprepitant were obtained following oral administration of aprepitant. Oral aprepitant did not affect the fertility or general reproductive performance of male or female rats at doses up to the maximum feasible dose of 1000 mg/kg twice daily (providing exposure in male rats lower than the exposure at the recommended human dose and exposure in female rats at about 1.6 times the human exposure).\n【231】 # Clinical Studies\n【232】 - Fosaprepitant, a prodrug of aprepitant, when administered intravenously is rapidly converted to aprepitant.\n【233】 - Oral administration of aprepitant in combination with ondansetron and dexamethasone (aprepitant regimen) has been shown to prevent acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic chemotherapy including high-dose cisplatin, and nausea and vomiting associated with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy.\n【234】 ## Highly Emetogenic Chemotherapy (HEC)\n【235】 EMEND for Injection 115 mg (3-Day Dosing Regimen of EMEND)\n【236】 - Fosaprepitant 115 mg intravenous infused over 15 minutes can be substituted for 125 mg oral aprepitant on Day 1 of a 3-day regimen. Efficacy studies with the 3-day regimen were conducted with oral aprepitant.\n【237】 - In 2 multicenter, randomized, parallel, double-blind, controlled clinical studies, the aprepitant regimen (see Table 11) was compared with standard therapy in patients receiving a chemotherapy regimen that included cisplatin >50 mg/m2 (mean cisplatin dose = 80.2 mg/m2). Of the 550 patients who were randomized to receive the aprepitant regimen, 42% were women, 58% men, 59% White, 3% Asian, 5% Black, 12% Hispanic American, and 21% Multi-Racial. The aprepitant-treated patients in these clinical studies ranged from 14 to 84 years of age, with a mean age of 56 years. 170 patients were 65 years or older, with 29 patients being 75 years or older.\n【238】 - Patients (N = 1105) were randomized to either the aprepitant regimen (N = 550) or standard therapy (N = 555). The treatment regimens are defined in Table 11.\n【239】 - During these studies, 95% of the patients in the aprepitant group received a concomitant chemotherapeutic agent in addition to protocol-mandated cisplatin. The most common chemotherapeutic agents and the number of aprepitant patients exposed follow: etoposide (106), fluorouracil (100), gemcitabine (89), vinorelbine (82), paclitaxel (52), cyclophosphamide (50), doxorubicin (38), docetaxel (11).\n【240】 - The antiemetic activity of oral aprepitant was evaluated during the acute phase (0 to 24 hours post-cisplatin treatment), the delayed phase (25 to 120 hours post-cisplatin treatment) and overall (0 to 120 hours post-cisplatin treatment) in Cycle 1. Efficacy was based on evaluation of the following endpoints in which emetic episodes included vomiting, retching, or dry heaves:\n【241】 Primary endpoint:\n【242】 - complete response (defined as no emetic episodes and no use of rescue therapy as recorded in patient diaries)\n【243】 Other prespecified endpoints:\n【244】 - Complete protection (defined as no emetic episodes, no use of rescue therapy, and a maximum nausea visual analogue scale  score <25 mm on a 0 to 100 mm scale)\n【245】 - No emesis (defined as no emetic episodes regardless of use of rescue therapy)\n【246】 - No nausea (maximum VAS <5 mm on a 0 to 100 mm scale)\n【247】 - No significant nausea (maximum VAS <25 mm on a 0 to 100 mm scale)\n【248】 - A summary of the key study results from each individual study analysis is shown in Table 12 and in Table 13.\n【249】 - In both studies, a statistically significantly higher proportion of patients (both p<0.001) receiving the aprepitant regimen in Cycle 1 had a complete response in the overall phase (primary endpoint), compared with patients receiving standard therapy. A statistically significant difference in complete response in favor of the aprepitant regimen was also observed when the acute phase and the delayed phase were analyzed separately.\n【250】 - In both studies, the estimated time to first emesis after initiation of cisplatin treatment was longer with the aprepitant regimen, and the incidence of first emesis was reduced in the aprepitant regimen group compared with standard therapy group as depicted in the Kaplan-Meier curves in Figure 2.\n【251】 Additional Patient-Reported Outcomes: The impact of nausea and vomiting on patients' daily lives was assessed in Cycle 1 of both phase 3 studies using the Functional Living Index–Emesis (FLIE), a validated nausea- and vomiting-specific patient-reported outcome measure. Minimal or no impact of nausea and vomiting on patients' daily lives is defined as a FLIE total score >108. In each of the 2 studies, a higher proportion of patients receiving the aprepitant regimen reported minimal or no impact of nausea and vomiting on daily life (Study 1: 74% versus 64%; Study 2: 75% versus 64%).\n【252】 Multiple-Cycle Extension: In the same 2 clinical studies, patients continued into the Multiple-Cycle extension for up to 5 additional cycles of chemotherapy. The proportion of patients with no emesis and no significant nausea by treatment group at each cycle is depicted in Figure 3.\n【253】 EMEND for Injection 150 mg (Single Dose Regimen of EMEND)\n【254】 - EMEND for Injection 150 mg infused over 20-30 minutes is administered on Day 1 only and can be substituted for the 3-day dosing regimen of EMEND for the prevention of nausea and vomiting induced by HEC.\n【255】 - In a randomized, parallel, double-blind, active-controlled study, EMEND for Injection 150 mg (N=1147) was compared with a 3-day oral aprepitant regimen (N=1175) (see Table 14 below) in patients receiving a highly emetogenic chemotherapy regimen that included cisplatin (≥70 mg/m2). Patient demographics were similar between the two treatment groups. Of the total 2322 patients receiving EMEND for Injection or oral aprepitant, 63% were men, 56% White, 26% Asian, 3% American Indian/Alaska Native, 2% Black, 13% Multi-Racial, and 33% Hispanic/Latino ethnicity. Patient ages ranged from 19 to 86 years of age, with a mean age of 56 years. Other concomitant chemotherapy agents were administered similar to those in prior HEC studies described above.\n【256】 - The efficacy of fosaprepitant 150 mg was evaluated based on the primary and secondary endpoints listed in Table 15 below and was shown to be non-inferior to that of the 3-day oral aprepitant regimen with regard to complete response in each of the evaluated phases. The pre-specified non-inferiority margin for complete response in the overall phase was 7%. The pre-specified non-inferiority margin for complete response in the delayed phase was 7.3%. The pre-specified non-inferiority margin for no vomiting in the overall phase was 8.2%.\n【257】 ## Moderately Emetogenic Chemotherapy (MEC)\n【258】 - In a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, clinical study in breast cancer patients, the aprepitant regimen (see Table 16) was compared with a standard of care therapy in patients receiving a moderately emetogenic chemotherapy regimen that included cyclophosphamide 750-1500 mg/m2; or cyclophosphamide 500-1500 mg/m2 and doxorubicin (≤60 mg/m2) or epirubicin (≤100 mg/m2).\n【259】 - In this study, the most common combinations were cyclophosphamide + doxorubicin (60.6%); and cyclophosphamide + epirubicin + fluorouracil (21.6%).\n【260】 - Of the 438 patients who were randomized to receive the aprepitant regimen, 99.5% were women. Of these, approximately 80% were White, 8% Black, 8% Asian, 4% Hispanic, and <1% Other. The aprepitant-treated patients in this clinical study ranged from 25 to 78 years of age, with a mean age of 53 years; 70 patients were 65 years or older, with 12 patients being over 74 years.\n【261】 - Patients (N = 866) were randomized to either the aprepitant regimen (N = 438) or standard therapy (N = 428). The treatment regimens are defined in Table 16.\n【262】 - The antiemetic activity of oral aprepitant was evaluated based on the following endpoints in which emetic episodes included vomiting, retching, or dry heaves:\n【263】 - Primary endpoint:\n【264】 - Complete response (defined as no emetic episodes and no use of rescue therapy as recorded in patient diaries) in the overall phase (0 to 120 hours post-chemotherapy)\n【265】 - Other prespecified endpoints:\n【266】 - No emesis (defined as no emetic episodes regardless of use of rescue therapy)\n【267】 - No nausea (maximum VAS <5 mm on a 0 to 100 mm scale)\n【268】 - No significant nausea (maximum VAS <25 mm on a 0 to 100 mm scale)\n【269】 - Complete protection (defined as no emetic episodes, no use of rescue therapy, and a maximum nausea visual analogue scale  score <25 mm on a 0 to 100 mm scale)\n【270】 - Complete response during the acute and delayed phases.\n【271】 - A summary of the key results from this study is shown in Table 17.\n【272】 - In this study, a statistically significantly (p=0.015) higher proportion of patients receiving the aprepitant regimen in Cycle 1 had a complete response (primary endpoint) during the overall phase compared with patients receiving standard therapy. The difference between treatment groups was primarily driven by the \"No Emesis Endpoint\", a principal component of this composite primary endpoint. In addition, a higher proportion of patients receiving the aprepitant regimen in Cycle 1 had a complete response during the acute (0-24 hours) and delayed (25-120 hours) phases compared with patients receiving standard therapy; however, the treatment group differences failed to reach statistical significance, after multiplicity adjustments.\n【273】 - Additional Patient-Reported Outcomes: In a phase 3 study in patients receiving moderately emetogenic chemotherapy, the impact of nausea and vomiting on patients' daily lives was assessed in Cycle 1 using the FLIE. A higher proportion of patients receiving the aprepitant regimen reported minimal or no impact on daily life (64% versus 56%). This difference between treatment groups was primarily driven by the \"No Vomiting Domain\" of this composite endpoint.\n【274】 - Multiple-Cycle Extension: Patients receiving moderately emetogenic chemotherapy were permitted to continue into the Multiple-Cycle extension of the study for up to 3 additional cycles of chemotherapy. Antiemetic effect for patients receiving the aprepitant regimen is maintained during all cycles.\n【275】 - Postmarketing Trial: In a postmarketing, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, clinical study in 848 cancer patients, the aprepitant regimen (N=430) was compared with a standard of care therapy (N=418) in patients receiving a moderately emetogenic chemotherapy regimen that included any IV dose of oxaliplatin, carboplatin, epirubicin, idarubicin, ifosfamide, irinotecan, daunorubicin, doxorubicin; cyclophosphamide IV (1 g/m2).\n【276】 - Of the 430 patients who were randomized to receive the aprepitant regimen, 76% were women and 24% were men. The distribution by race was 67% White, 6% Black or African American, 11% Asian, and 12% multiracial. Classified by ethnicity, 36% were Hispanic and 64% were non-Hispanic. The aprepitant-treated patients in this clinical study ranged from 22 to 85 years of age, with a mean age of 57 years; approximately 59% of the patients were 55 years or older with 32 patients being over 74 years. Patients receiving the aprepitant regimen were receiving chemotherapy for a variety of tumor types including 50% with breast cancer, 21% with gastrointestinal cancers including colorectal cancer, 13% with lung cancer and 6% with gynecological cancers.\n【277】 - The antiemetic activity of EMEND was evaluated based on no vomiting (with or without rescue therapy) in the overall period (0 to 120 hours post-chemotherapy) and complete response (defined as no vomiting and no use of rescue therapy) in the overall period.\n【278】 - A summary of the key results from this study is shown in Table 18.\n【279】 - In this study, a statistically significantly higher proportion of patients receiving the aprepitant regimen (76%) in Cycle 1 had no vomiting during the overall phase compared with patients receiving standard therapy (62%). In addition, a higher proportion of patients receiving the aprepitant regimen (69%) in Cycle 1 had a complete response in the overall phase (0-120 hours) compared with patients receiving standard therapy (56%). In the acute phase (0 to 24 hours following initiation of chemotherapy), a higher proportion of patients receiving aprepitant compared to patients receiving standard therapy were observed to have no vomiting (92% and 84%, respectively) and complete response (89% and 80%, respectively). In the delayed phase (25 to 120 hours following initiation of chemotherapy), a higher proportion of patients receiving aprepitant compared to patients receiving standard therapy were observed to have no vomiting (78% and 67%, respectively) and complete response (71% and 61%, respectively).\n【280】 - In a subgroup analysis by tumor type, a numerically higher proportion of patients receiving aprepitant were observed to have no vomiting and complete response compared to patients receiving standard therapy. For gender, the difference in complete response rates between the aprepitant and standard regimen groups was 14% in females (64.5% and 50.3%, respectively) and 4% in males (82.2% and 78.2%, respectively) during the overall phase. A similar difference for gender was observed for the no vomiting endpoint.\n【281】 # How Supplied\n【282】 - No. 3884 — One 115-mg single dose glass vial: White to off-white lyophilized solid.

These schemas are a mental structure that represents some aspect of the world. They are organized in memory in an associative network. In these associative networks, similar schemas are clustered together. When a particular schema is activated related schemas may be activated as well. Schema activation may also increase the accessibility of related schemas in the associative network. When a schema is more accessible this means it can more quickly be activated and used in a particular situation. When related schemas are activated, inferences beyond the information given in a particular social situation may influence thinking and social behavior, regardless of whether those inferences are accurate or not. Lastly, when a schema is activated a person may or may not be aware of it.\n【3】 Two processes that increase the accessibility of schemas are salience and priming. Salience is the degree to which a particular social object stands out relative to other social objects in a situation. The higher the salience of an object the more likely that schemas for that object will be made accessible. For example, if there is one female in a group of seven males, female gender schemas may be more accessible and influence the group’s thinking and behavior toward the female group member. Priming refers to any experiences immediately prior to a situation that caused a schema to be more accessible. For example watching a scary movie at a theatre late at night might increase the accessibility of frightening schemas that affect a person’s perception of shadows and background noises as potential threats.\n【4】 Social cognition researchers are also interested in how new information is integrated into pre-established schemas, especially when that information is contrary with those pre-established schemas. Pre-established schemas tend to guide attention to new information. People selectively attend to information that is consistent with the schema and ignore information that is inconsistent. This is referred to as a confirmation bias. Sometimes inconsistent information is sub-categorized and stored away as a special case, leaving the original schema intact without any alterations. This referred to as subtyping.\n【5】 Social cognition researchers are also interested in studying the regulation of activated schemas. It is believed that the situational activation of schemas is automatic, meaning that it is outside the control of the individual. In many situations however, the schematic information that has been activated may be in conflict with the social norms of situation, in which case an individual is motivated to inhibit the influence of the schematic information on their thinking and social behavior. Whether a person will successfully regulate the application of the activated schemas is dependent on individual differences in self-regulatory ability and the presence of situational impairments to executive control. High self-regulatory ability and the lack of situational impairments on executive functioning increase the likelihood that individuals will successfully inhibit the influence of automatically activated schemas on their thinking and social behavior. However, when people stop suppressing the influence of the unwanted thoughts, a rebound effect can occur where the thought becomes hyper-accessible.\n【6】 # Social cognitive neuroscience\n【7】 There has been much recent interest in the links between social cognition and brain function, particularly as neuropsychological studies have shown that brain injury (particularly to the frontal lobes) can adversely affect social judgements and interaction. The case of Phineas Gage was an early and influential example of this finding.\n【8】 People diagnosed with certain mental illnesses are also known to show differences in how they process social information. There is now an expanding research field examining how such conditions may bias cognitive processes involved in social interaction, or conversely, how such biases may lead to the symptoms associated with the condition.\n【9】 It is also becoming clear that some aspects of psychological processes that promote social behavior (such as face recognition) may be innate. Studies have shown that newborn babies, younger than one hour old can selectively recognize and respond to faces, while people with some developmental disorders such as autism or Williams syndrome may show differences in social interaction and social communication when compared to their unaffected peers.\n【10】 # History of social cognition\n【11】 Social cognition came to prominence with the rise of cognitive psychology in the late 1960s and early 1970s and is now the dominant model and approach in mainstream social psychology. It is very likely that social psychology was always a lot more cognitive than mainstream psychology to begin with, as it traditionally discussed internal mental states such as beliefs and desires when mainstream psychology was dominated by behaviourism and rejected them as illusory. A parallel paradigm has arisen in the study of action, termed motor cognition . Motor cognition is concerned with understanding the representation of action and the associated process.\n【12】 # Further reading\n【13】 - Dedicated issue of Philosophical Transactions B on Social Cognition in Animals is freely available.", "title": "Social cognition", "tags": "", "lang": "", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"id\": \"3d4eecb520d9663a26bfc2297c94304e7f7bbfa6\", \"overview\": \"None\", \"url\": \"https://www.wikidoc.org/index.php/Social_cognition\", \"source\": \"wikidoc\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-01-28 23:07:59", "update_time": "2024-01-28 23:55:32"}

Polymyositis and dermatomyositis are subtypes of idiopathic inflammatory myopathy. Patients develop proximal muscle weakness manifested as difficulty to raise their arms above the shoulders or from chair, or climbing stairs and progress to distal muscle weakness. Patients with dermatomyositis suffer from skin lesions in which Gottron's papules and the heliotrope eruption considered as pathognomonic features. The exact pathogenesis of polymyositis and dermatomyositis is not fully understood. However, it is understood that polymyositis and dermatomyositis are the result of autoimmune attack but triggering factors are not well-known. Polymyositis is caused by inflammation and degeneration of the muscles. Dermatomyositis is caused by skin inflammation. In dermatomyositis, activation and deposition of complements may lead to lysis of endomysial capillaries and muscle ischemia. Genes including HLA DRB1*0301 and HLA DQA1*0501 alleles, and tumour necrosis factor 308A might be associated with development of polymyositis and dermatomyositis, especially in familial cases. Different conditions associated with polymyositis and dermatomyositis include respiratory and cardiac diseases, other connective tissue diseases, and malignancies. The incidence of polymyositis and dermatomyositis is approximately 1-5 per 100,000 individuals worldwide. The prevalence of polymyositis and dermatomyositis is approximately 5-22 per 100,000 individuals worldwide. The 5-year survival rate for polymyositis is 75% and for dermatomyositis is 63%. The median survival for polymyositis is 11.0 years and that for dermatomyositis is 12.3 years. Muscle biopsy is the gold standard test for the diagnosis of polymyositis and dermatomyositis. Prognosis of polymyositis and dermatomyositis varies depends on different studies. Prognosis is generally poor, and the overall mortality rate of patients with polymyositis and dermatomyositis is approximately 22%. Most common cause of death in patients with polymyositis and dermatomyositis include cardiac and pulmonary complications, infections, and cancers. Common risk factors in the development of polymyositis and dermatomyositis include environmental factors such as infection, malignancy, and drug toxicities from statins or immune checkpoint inhibitors. Effective measures for prevention of complications include regular follow ups, malignancy screening, pulmonary protection, lifestyle modification, and prevention of medication-induced complications.\n【3】 # Historical Perspective\n【4】 In the late 19th century, polymyositis and dermatomyositis were described by different scientists. In 1916, Stertz was the first who described the association between dermatomyositis and malignancy. In 1975, Anthony Bohan and James B. Peter were the first physicians who classified polymyositis and dermatomyositis into 5 subtypes which were used for decades. By 1990, multiple myositis-specific autoantibodies (MSA) were discovered and described. These myositis-specific autoantibodies (MSA) targeting different cytoplasmic ribonucleoproteins and they are used by Love et al. to classify polymyositis and dermatomyositis.\n【5】 # Classification\n【6】 Polymyositis and dermatomyositis is one of the subtypes of idiopathic inflammatory myopathy. The 2017 European League Against Rheumatism and American College of Rheumatology (EULAR/ACR) classified idiopathic inflammatory myopathy into 6 subtypes including polymyositis, dermatomyositis, inclusion body myositis, immune-mediated necrotizing myopathies (IMNM), amyopathic dermatomyositis, and juvenile dermatomyositis.\n【7】 # Pathophysiology\n【8】 The exact pathogenesis of polymyositis and dermatomyositis is not fully understood. However, it is understood that polymyositis and dermatomyositis are the result of autoimmune attack but triggering factors are not well-known. Polymyositis is caused by inflammation and degeneration of the muscles. In polymyositis, CD8-positive cytotoxic T cells invade muscle fibers that express MHC class I antigens which may leads to fiber necrosis via the perforin pathway. Hypoxia may reduce creatine phosphate and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels in muscle and lead to fatigue and muscle weakness. Dermatomyositis is caused by skin inflammation. In dermatomyositis, activation and deposition of complements may lead to lysis of endomysial capillaries and muscle ischemia. Genes including HLA DRB1*0301 and HLA DQA1*0501 alleles, and tumour necrosis factor 308A might be associated with development of polymyositis and dermatomyositis, especially in familial cases. Different conditions associated with polymyositis and dermatomyositis include respiratory and cardiac diseases, other [[Connective tissue diseaseconnective tissue diseases, and malignancies.The inflammatory cells are predominantly B-cells (with smaller numbers of CD4-positive T-cells) and are found around blood vessels, in the septa between muscle fascicles, and in fibroadipose tissue around muscle. The key pathological change of dermatomyositis is a vasculitis, which involves endomysial and perimysial capillaries and arterioles. This vasculitis begins with endothelial swelling and is followed by endothelial necrosis and capillary loss. Tubuloreticular cytoplasmic inclusions (TRIs) are often seen in endothelial cells. TRIs also occur in lupus and other collagen vascular diseases but are absent in polymyositis and inclusion body myositis. The vasculitis is thought to be caused by circulating anti-endothelial antibodies. Interaction of these antibodies with vascular antigensactivates complement, leading to formation of the membranolytic attack complex (MAC), which destroys endothelial cells.\n【9】 # Causes\n【10】 The cause of polymyositis and dermatomyositis has not been identified.\n【11】 # Differentiating Polymyositis and Dermatomyositis from Other Diseases\n【12】 Polymyositis and Dermatomyositis must be differentiated from other inflammatory myopathies which cause muscle weakness and systemic symptoms.\n【13】 # Epidemiology and Demographics\n【14】 The incidence of polymyositis and dermatomyositis is approximately 1-5 per 100,000 individuals worldwide. The prevalence of polymyositis and dermatomyositis is approximately 5-22 per 100,000 individuals worldwide. The 5-year survival rate for polymyositis is 75% and for dermatomyositis is 63%. The median survival for polymyositis is 11.0 years and that for dermatomyositis is 12.3 years. Dermatomyositis has a bimodal pattern, commonly affects both children and adults over 50 years old. Polymyositis commonly affects adults after second decades of their lives and it is rare among children. There is no racial predilection to polymyositis and dermatomyositis. The female to male ratio is approximately 2 to 1. Prevalence of polymyositis and dermatomyositis are lower in young rural men and higher in older urban women. Pharmacologic medical therapies for polymyositis and dermatomyositis include corticosteroids and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs).\n【15】 # Risk Factors\n【16】 Common risk factors in the development of polymyositis and dermatomyositis include environmental factors such as infection, malignancy, and drug toxicities from statins or immune checkpoint inhibitors.\n【17】 # Screening\n【18】 There is insufficient evidence to recommend routine screening for polymyositis and dermatomyositis.\n【19】 # Natural History, Complications, and Prognosis\n【20】 The symptoms of polymyositis and dermatomyositis usually develop very slowly and progressively from proximal muscle weakness manifested as difficulty to raise their arms above the shoulders or from chair, or climbing stairs to distal muscle weakness. In dermatomyositis, myositis develops months to years after skin manifestations. Common complications of polymyositis and dermatomyositis include malignancy, cardiac, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, infection, and medication related complications. Prognosis of polymyositis and dermatomyositis varies depends on different studies. Prognosis is generally poor, and the overall mortality rate of patients with polymyositis and dermatomyositis is approximately 22%. Most common cause of death in patients with polymyositis and dermatomyositis include cardiac and pulmonary complications, infections, and cancers. Extramuscular organ involvement, older age of diagnosis, male gender, and non-Caucasian race are associated with a particularly poor prognosis among patients with polymyositis and dermatomyositis. Younger age of diagnosis and quicker therapy initiation are associated with a better prognosis.\n【21】 # Diagnosis\n【22】 ## Diagnostic Study of Choice\n【23】 Muscle biopsy is the gold standard test for the diagnosis of polymyositis and dermatomyositis. Necrosis, increase in endomysial and perimysial connective tissue, atrophy and degeneration of both type I and II fibers, especially in a perifascicular distribution might be seen in muscle biopsy. The muscle biopsy should be performed when a patient presented with symptoms of muscle weakness and skin rash or elevated level of muscle enzymes.\n【24】 ## History and Symptoms\n【25】 Polymyositis and dermatomyositis is a multisystem disorder that involves many organs. The hallmark of polymyositis is symmetric muscle weakness. The hallmark of dermatomyositis is skin manifestation. Patients with polymyositis and dermatomyositis may have a positive history of gradual worsening of proximal muscle weakness, past medical history or family history of other autoimmune diseases. Common symptoms include constitutional symptoms, mild myalgias, skin eruptions, joint pain, and swelling. Less common symptoms of polymyositis and dermatomyositis include cough, dyspnea, aspiration, dysphagia, nasal regurgitation, swelling of periorbital area, and fingernails.\n【26】 ## Physical Examination\n【27】 Physical examination of patients with polymyositis and dermatomyositis is usually remarkable for muscle weakness, hyporeflexia, skin lesions, respiratory symptoms. The presence of Gottron's papules and the heliotrope eruption on physical examination is pathognomonic of dermatomyositis. Muscle atrophy in severe, long standing disease might occur.\n【28】 ## Laboratory Findings\n【29】 Elevated sarcoplasmic enzymes are consistent with the diagnosis of polymyositis and dermatomyositis which include creatine phosphokinase, aldolase, transaminases, lactic dehydrogenase, and myoglobin. High white blood cell counts, low lymphocytes, and low hematocrit levels might be detected on CBC. Low albumin levels, high ESR and high IgMand IgG levels could be seen in patients with polymyositis and dermatomyositis. 20 myositis-specific autoantibodies are identified in patients with polymyositis and dermatomyositis. Anti-Jo-1 antibody is the most frequent myositis-specific autoantibodies which causes antisynthetase syndrome. Anti Mi-2 might be seen frequently in patients with dermatomyositis. Anti-SRP antibody is associated with very poor prognosis. Some of these myositis-specific autoantibodies are associated with malignancy. Anti-HMGCR antibody might be elevated in patients with statin-associated necrotizing autoimmune myopathy (SANAM).\n【30】 ## Electrocardiogram\n【31】 An ECG may be helpful in the diagnosis of cardiac complications of polymyositis and dermatomyositis. Findings on an ECG suggestive of cardiac involvement include conductionabnormalities, arrhythmias, left atrial abnormality, and ST-T changes.\n【32】 ## X-ray\n【33】 X-ray may be helpful in the diagnosis of polymyositis, dermatomyositis, and their complications, which include dystrophic calcification in the soft tissue, interstitial lung diseaseand malignancy.\n【34】 ## Echocardiography and Ultrasound\n【35】 Different ultrasound modalities might be used to diagnose polymyositis, which include doppler sonography, contrast-enhanced ultrasound, and sonoelastography. There are no echocardiography findings associated with polymyositis and dermatomyositis. However, an echocardiography may be helpful in the diagnosis of cardiac complications of polymyositis and dermatomyositis, which include left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, hyperdynamic heart, mitral valve prolapse, and endomyocardial fibrosis.\n【36】 ## CT scan\n【37】 There are no CT scan findings associated with polymyositis and dermatomyositis. However, a CT scan may be helpful in the diagnosis of complications of polymyositis and dermatomyositis, which include interstitial lung disease or malignancy.\n【38】 ## MRI\n【39】 MRI from muscles may be helpful in the diagnosis of polymyositis and dermatomyositis. Findings on MRI suggestive of polymyositis and dermatomyositis include areas of high signal intensity reflecting an active disease and muscle edema, fatty infiltration of muscles, and muscle calcification.\n【40】 ## Other Imaging Findings\n【41】 There are no other imaging findings associated with polymyositis and dermatomyositis.\n【42】 ## Other Diagnostic Studies\n【43】 Electromyogram may be helpful in the diagnosis of polymyositis and dermatomyositis. Findings suggestive of polymyositis and dermatomyositis include delay in electrical signals between the muscles and nerves when they are stimulated, polyphasic, short, small motor-unit potentials, and fibrillation, positive sharp waves, increased insertional irritability. The first sign of improvement in polymyositis and dermatomyositis is the disappearance of fibrillation potentials. Electromyogram may also be used to identifying active sites of myositis for biopsy, follow up, and the treatment efficacy. Skin biopsy may be used in dermatomyositis, which demonstrates poikiloderma, epidermal atrophy, and liquefaction degeneration of the basal cells. Histochemical staining might be helpful to differentiate polymyositis and dermatomyositis from lower-motor-neuron diseases.\n【44】 # Treatment\n【45】 ## Medical Therapy\n【46】 Pharmacologic medical therapies for polymyositis and dermatomyositis include corticosteroids and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Patients with polymyositis and dermatomyositis might require long-term treatment. However, if there are no disease flares during the course of the taper, glucocorticoids could be discontinued at 9 to 12 months. DMARDs might be discontinued at 6 months. Patients with recurrent flare of polymyositis and dermatomyositis require higher dose of prednisone, adding or increasing dose of methotrexate or azathioprine. Rituximab, IVIg, and mycophenolate mofetil might be used in resistant diseases.\n【47】 ## Surgery\n【48】 Surgical intervention is not recommended for the management of polymyositis and dermatomyositis.\n【49】 ## Primary Prevention\n【50】 There are no established measures for the primary prevention of polymyositis and dermatomyositis.\n【51】 ## Secondary Prevention\n【52】 Effective measures for the secondary prevention of polymyositis and dermatomyositis include regular follow ups, malignancy screening, pulmonary protection, lifestyle modification, and prevention of medication-induced complications.", "title": "Polymyositis and dermatomyositis", "tags": "", "lang": "", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"overview\": \"None\", \"source\": \"wikidoc\", \"url\": \"https://www.wikidoc.org/index.php/Polymyositis_and_dermatomyositis_overview\", \"id\": \"9ec19b815511545dea361f1f124859c3877820db\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-01-28 23:07:59", "update_time": "2024-01-29 00:04:41"}

Most commonly water is the solvent of interest, although the same basic principles apply with any solvent.\n【4】 In the case of environmental science studies of water quality, the total concentration of dissolved solids (not necessarily at saturation) is referred to as total dissolved solids.\n【5】 # Non-ionic compounds\n【6】 Dissolution of an organic solid can be described as an equilibrium between the substance in its solid and dissolved forms:\n【7】 An equilibrium expression for this reaction can be written, as for any chemical reaction (products over reactants):\n【8】 where K is called the equilibrium  constant (or solubility constant). The  curly brackets indicate activity. The activity of a pure solid is, by definition, unity. If the activity of the substance in solution is constant (i.e. not affected by any other solutes that may be present) it may be replaced by the concentration.\n【9】 The square brackets mean molar concentration in mol dm-3 (sometimes called molarity with symbol M).\n【10】 This statement says that water at equilibrium with solid sugar contains a concentration equal to K.  For table sugar (sucrose) at 25 °C,  K = 1.971 mol/L.  (This solution is very concentrated; sucrose is extremely soluble in water.)  This is the maximum amount of sugar that can dissolve at 25 °C; the solution is saturated. If the concentration is below saturation, more sugar dissolves until the solution reaches saturation, or all the solid is consumed. If more sugar is present than is allowed by the solubility expression then the solution is supersaturated and solid will precipitate until the saturation concentration is reached.  This process can be slow; the equilibrium expression describes concentrations when the system reaches equilibrium, not how fast it gets there.\n【11】 # Ionic compounds\n【12】 Ionic compounds normally dissociate into their constituent ions when they dissolve in water.  For example, for calcium sulfate:\n【13】 As for the previous example, the equilibrium expression is:\n【14】 where K is called the equilibrium (or solubility) constant and curly brackets indicate activity.\n【15】 The activity of a pure solid is, by definition, equal to one. When the solubility of the salt is very low the activity coefficients of the ions in solution will also be equal to one and this expression reduces to the solubility product expression:\n【16】 This expression says that an aqueous solution in equilibrium with (saturated) solid calcium sulfate has concentrations of these two ions such that their product equals Ksp; for calcium sulfate Ksp = 4.93×10−5.  If the solution contains only calcium sulfate, and the conditions are such that dissolved species are only Ca2+ and SO42-, then the concentration of each ion (and the overall solubility of calcium sulfate) is\n【17】 When a solution dissociates into unequal parts as in:\n【18】 then determining the solubility from Ksp is slightly more difficult. Generally, for the dissolution reaction:\n【19】 the solubility and solubility product are tied with the equation:\n【20】 \\sqrt{K_{\\mathrm{sp}} \\over {x^x \\cdot y^y}} = {C \\over M_M}\n【21】 Again, the above equation assumes that the dissolution takes place in pure solvent (no common ion effect), that there is no complexation or hydrolysis (i.e., only ions Bp+ and Cq- are present in the solution), and that the concentrations are sufficiently low for the activity coefficients to be taken as unity.\n【22】 ## Common ion effect\n【23】 The common-ion effect refers to the fact that solubility equilibria shift in accordance with Le Chatelier's Principle.  In the above example, addition of sulfate ions to a saturated solution of calcium sulfate causes CaSO4 to precipitate until the concentration of the ions in solution are such that they again satisfy the solubility product. (Addition of sulfate ions can, for example, be accomplished by adding a very soluble salt, such as Na2SO4.)\n【24】 ## Salt effect\n【25】 The salt effect refers to the fact that the presence of another salt, even though there is no common ion, has an effect on the ionic strength of the solution and hence on the activity coefficients of the ions, so that solubility changes even though Ksp remains constant (assuming that the activity of the solid remains unity).\n【26】 ## Speciation effect\n【27】 On dissolution, ionic salts typically dissociate into their constituent ions, but the ions may speciate in the solution. On speciation, the solubility will always increase although the solubility product does not change. For example, solubility equilibrium for calcium carbonate may be expressed by:\n【28】 Now, if the conditions (e.g., pH) are such that other carbonate (or calcium) species appear in the solution (for example, bicarbonate ion HCO3-), then the solubility of the solid will increase so that the solubility product remains constant.\n【29】 Similarly, if a complexing agent, for example EDTA, was present in the solution, solubility will increase because of the complexation of calcium (a complex has a different chemical identity than uncomplexed Ca2+ and therefore does not enter the solubility equilibrium).\n【30】 To correctly predict solubility from a given solubility product, the speciation need to be known (or evaluated, at least approximately). A failure to do so is a common problem and can lead to large errors.\n【31】 ## Phase effect\n【32】 Equilibria are defined for specific crystal phases. Therefore, the solubility product is expected to be different depending on the phase of the solid. For example, aragonite and calcite will have different solubility products even though they have both the same chemical identity (calcium carbonate). Nevertheless, under given conditions, most likely only one phase is thermodynamically stable and therefore this phase enters a true equilibrium.\n【33】 ## Particle size effect\n【34】 The thermodynamic solubility constant is defined for large monocrystals. Solubility will increase with decreasing size of solute particle (or droplet) because of the additional surface energy. This effect is generally small unless particles become very small, typically smaller than 1 μm. The effect of the particle size on solubility constant can be quantified as follows:\n【35】 where ^*K_{A} is the solublity constant for the solute particles with the molar surface area A, ^*K_{A \\to 0} is the solubility constant for substance with molar surface area tending to zero (i.e., when the particles are large), γ is the surface tension of the solute particle in the solvent, Am is the molar surface area of the solute (in m2/mol), R is the universal gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature.\n【36】 # Temperature effects\n【37】 Solubility is sensitive to changes in temperature.  For example, sugar is more soluble in hot water than cool water. It occurs because solubility constants, like other types of equilibrium constant, are functions of temperature.  In accordance with Le Chatelier's Principle, when the dissolution process is endothermic (heat is absorbed,) solubility increases with rising temperature, but when the process is exothermic (heat is released) solubility decreases with rising temperature.\n【38】 # Solubility constants\n【39】 Solubility constants have been experimentally determined for a large number of compounds and tables are readily available.  For ionic compounds the constants are called solubility products.  Concentration units are assumed to be molar unless otherwise stated.  Solubility is sometimes listed in units of grams dissolved per liter of water.\n【40】 Some values  at 25°C:\n【41】 - Barium carbonate: 2.60Template:E\n【42】 - Copper(I) chloride: 1.72Template:E\n【43】 - Lead(II) sulfate: 1.81Template:E\n【44】 - Magnesium carbonate: 1.15Template:E\n【45】 - Silver chloride: 1.70Template:E\n【46】 - Silver bromide: 7.7Template:E\n【47】 - Calcium hydroxide: 8.0Template:E\n【48】 See also\n【49】 - IUPAC-NIST solubility database\n【50】 - Solubility products of simple inorganic compounds\n【51】 # Table", "title": "Solubility equilibrium", "tags": "", "lang": "", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"https://www.wikidoc.org/index.php/Solubility_constant\", \"id\": \"3ecb80eccde779342ff2faef7e73b673fcba64b1\", \"source\": \"wikidoc\", \"overview\": \"None\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20231213", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"type3": "无关文本#41#51#Template:E，See also，Table"}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-01-28 23:07:59", "update_time": "2024-02-18 21:58:53"}

Adverse reactions are more likely to occur when dosage is increased.\n【32】 The following adverse reactions have been observed:\n【33】 - Body as a Whole: malaise\n【34】 - Digestive: abdominal cramps or discomfort, colicky pain, nausea and belching, diarrhea, borborygmi, salivation\n【35】 - Renal: urinary urgency\n【36】 - Nervous System: headache\n【37】 - Cardiovascular: a fall in blood pressure with reflex tachycardia, vasomotor response\n【38】 - Skin: flushing producing a feeling of warmth, sensation of heat about the face, sweating\n【39】 - Respiratory: bronchial constriction, asthmatic attacks\n【40】 - Special Senses: lacrimation, miosis\n【41】 ### Causal Relationship Unknown\n【42】 The following adverse reactions have been reported, and a causal relationship to therapy with bethanechol chloride has not been established:\n【43】 - Body as a Whole: malaise\n【44】 - Nervous System: seizures\n【45】 ## Postmarketing Experience\n【46】 There is limited information regarding Bethanechol chloride Postmarketing Experience in the drug label.\n【47】 # Drug Interactions\n【48】 Special care is required if this drug is given to patients receiving ganglion blocking compounds because a critical fall in blood pressure may occur. Usually, severe abdominal symptoms appear before there is such a fall in the blood pressure.\n【49】 # Use in Specific Populations\n【50】 ### Pregnancy\n【51】 Pregnancy Category (FDA): C\n【52】 Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with bethanechol chloride. It is also not known whether bethanechol chloride can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Bethanechol chloride should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.\n【53】 Pregnancy Category (AUS): B2\n【54】 There is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Bethanechol chloride in women who are pregnant.\n【55】 ### Labor and Delivery\n【56】 There is no FDA guidance on use of Bethanechol chloride during labor and delivery.\n【57】 ### Nursing Mothers\n【58】 It is not known whether this drug is secreted in human milk. Because many drugs are secreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from bethanechol chloride in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\n【59】 ### Pediatric Use\n【60】 Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.\n【61】 ### Geriatic Use\n【62】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of Bethanechol chloride in geriatric settings.\n【63】 ### Gender\n【64】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of Bethanechol chloride with respect to specific gender populations.\n【65】 ### Race\n【66】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of Bethanechol chloride with respect to specific racial populations.\n【67】 ### Renal Impairment\n【68】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of Bethanechol chloride in patients with renal impairment.\n【69】 ### Hepatic Impairment\n【70】 There is no FDA guidance on the use of Bethanechol chloride in patients with hepatic impairment.\n【71】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\n【72】 Long-term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate the effects upon fertility of bethanechol chloride.\n【73】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\n【74】 There is no FDA guidance one the use of Bethanechol chloride in patients who are immunocompromised.\n【75】 # Administration and Monitoring\n【76】 ### Administration\n【77】 Oral\n【78】 ### Monitoring\n【79】 There is limited information regarding Bethanechol chloride Monitoring in the drug label.\n【80】 # IV Compatibility\n【81】 There is limited information regarding the compatibility of Bethanechol chloride and IV administrations.\n【82】 # Overdosage\n【83】 Early signs of overdosage are abdominal discomfort, salivation, flushing of the skin (“hot feeling”), sweating, nausea and vomiting.\n【84】 Atropine sulfate is a specific antidote. The recommended dose for adults is 0.6 mg. Repeat doses can be given every two hours, according to clinical response. The recommended dosage in infants and children up to 12 years of age is 0.01 mg/kg (to a maximum single dose of 0.4 mg) repeated every two hours as needed until the desired effect is obtained or adverse effects of atropine preclude further usage. Subcutaneous injection of atropine is preferred except in emergencies when the intravenous route may be employed.\n【85】 The oral LD50 of bethanechol chloride is 1510 mg/kg in the mouse.\n【86】 # Pharmacology\n【87】 ## Mechanism of Action\n【88】 Bethanechol chloride acts principally by producing the effects of stimulation of the para- sympathetic nervous system. It increases the tone of the detrusor urinae muscle, usually producing a contraction sufficiently strong to initiate micturition and empty the bladder. It stimulates gastric motility, increases gastric tone and often restores impaired rhythmic peristalsis.\n【89】 Stimulation of the parasympathetic nervous system releases acetylcholine at the nerve endings. When spontaneous stimulation is reduced and therapeutic intervention is required, acetylcholine can be given, but it is rapidly hydrolyzed by cholinesterase and its effects are transient. Bethan- echol chloride is not destroyed by cholinesterase and its effects are more prolonged than those of acetylcholine.\n【90】 ## Structure\n【91】 It is designated chemically as 2--N, N, N-trimethyl-1-propanaminium chloride. Its structural formula is:\n【92】 ## Pharmacodynamics\n【93】 Because of the selective action of bethanechol chloride, nicotinic symptoms of cholinergic stimulation are usually absent or minimal when orally or subcutaneously administered in therapeutic doses, while muscarinic effects are prominent. Muscarinic effects usually occur within 5 to 15 minutes after subcutaneous injection, reach a maximum in 15 to 30 minutes, and disappear within two hours. Doses that stimulate micturition and defecation and increase peristalsis do not ordinarily stimulate ganglia or voluntary muscles. Therapeutic test doses in normal human subjects have little effect on heart rate, blood pressure or peripheral circulation.\n【94】 Bethanechol chloride does not cross the blood-brain barrier because of its charged quaternary amine moiety. The metabolic rate and mode of excretion of the drug have not been elucidated.\n【95】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n【96】 Effects on the Gl and urinary tracts sometimes appear within 30 minutes after oral administration of bethanechol chloride, but more often 60 to 90 minutes are required to reach maximum effec- tiveness. Following oral administration, the usual duration of action of bethanechol chloride is one hour, although large doses (300 to 400 mg) have been reported to produce effects for up to six hours. Subcutaneous injection produces a more intense action on bladder muscle than does oral administration of the drug.\n【97】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\n【98】 ### Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\n【99】 Long-term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate the effects upon fertility, mutagenic or carcinogenic potential of bethanechol chloride.\n【100】 # Clinical Studies\n【101】 A clinical study (Diokno, A.C.; Lapides, J.; Urol 10: 23-24, July 1977) was conducted on the relative effectiveness of oral and subcutaneous doses of bethanechol chloride on the stretch response of bladder muscle in patients with urinary retention. Results showed that 5 mg of the drug given subcutaneously stimulated a response that was more rapid in onset and of larger magnitude than an oral dose of 50 mg, 100 mg, or 200 mg. All the oral doses, however, had a longer duration of effect than the subcutaneous dose. Although the 50 mg oral dose caused little change in intravesical pressure in this study, this dose has been found in other studies to be clinically effective in the rehabilitation of patients with decompensated bladders.\n【102】 # How Supplied\n【103】 - Bethanechol chloride 5 mg tablet\n【104】 - Available in bottles of 100\n【105】 - Bethanechol chloride 10 mg tablet\n【106】 - Available in bottles of 100\n【107】 - Bethanechol chloride 25 mg tablet\n【108】 - Available in bottles of 100\n【109】 - Bethanechol chloride 50 mg tablet\n【110】 - Available in bottles of 100\n【111】 ## Storage\n【112】 Store at 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F)\n【113】 # Images\n【114】 ## Drug Images\n【115】 ## Package and Label Display Panel\n【116】 # Patient Counseling Information\n【117】 Bethanechol chloride should preferably be taken one hour before or two hours after meals to avoid nausea or vomiting.

However, at the lower concentrations seen in commercial products, triclosan appears bacteriostatic, and it targets bacteria primarily by inhibiting fatty acid synthesis.\n【78】 - Triclosan binds to bacterial enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase (ENR) enzyme, which is encoded by the gene FabI. This binding increases the enzyme's affinity for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+). This results in the formation of a stable, ternary complex of ENR-NAD+-triclosan, which is unable to participate in fatty acid synthesis. Fatty acids are necessary for building and reproducing cell membranes. Humans do not have an ENR enzyme and thus are not affected.\n【79】 ## Structure\n【80】 There is limited information regarding Triclosan Structure in the drug label.\n【81】 ## Pharmacodynamics\n【82】 There is limited information regarding Pharmacodynamics of Triclosan in the drug label.\n【83】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n【84】 There is limited information regarding Pharmacokinetics of Triclosan in the drug label.\n【85】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\n【86】 There is limited information regarding Nonclinical Toxicology of Triclosan in the drug label.\n【87】 # Clinical Studies\n【88】 There is limited information regarding Clinical Studies of Triclosan in the drug label.\n【89】 # How Supplied\n【90】 There is limited information regarding Triclosan How Supplied in the drug label.\n【91】 ## Storage\n【92】 There is limited information regarding Triclosan Storage in the drug label.\n【93】 # Images\n【94】 ## Drug Images\n【95】 ## Package and Label Display Panel\n【96】 # Patient Counseling Information\n【97】 There is limited information regarding Patient Counseling Information of Triclosan in the drug label.\n【98】 # Precautions with Alcohol\n【99】 - Alcohol-Triclosan interaction has not been established.

Similarly, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention describes tobacco use as \"the single most important preventable risk to human health in developed countries and an important cause of premature death worldwide.\"\n【3】 # Primary risks\n【4】 Regular smokers are estimated to live to 2.5 to 10 years less than nonsmokers. About one-half of male smokers will die of illness due to smoking.\n【5】 Tobacco related illnesses kill 440,000 USA citizens per year, about 1,205 per day, making it the leading cause of preventable death in the U.S.  The World Health Organization has stated that tobacco is set to kill a billion people this century\n【6】 The main health risks in tobacco pertain to diseases of the cardiovascular system, in particular smoking being a major risk factor for a myocardial infarction (heart attack), diseases of the respiratory tract such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and emphysema, and cancer, particularly lung cancer and cancers of the larynx and mouth. Prior to World War I, lung cancer was considered to be a rare disease, which most physicians would never see during their career. With the postwar rise in popularity of cigarette smoking came a virtual epidemic of lung cancer.\n【7】 Currently, among people who have ever smoked any kind of tobacco, almost one in ten will develop lung cancer.  One in six men who continue to smoke tobacco will develop lung cancer.  This compares to only one case of lung cancer in seventy-five lifelong non-smokers.\n【8】 Incidence of impotence is approximately 85 percent higher in male smokers compared to non-smokers, and it is a key cause of erectile dysfunction (ED). Smoking causes impotence because it promotes arterial narrowing.\n【9】 A person's increased risk of contracting disease is directly proportional to the length of time that a person continues to smoke as well as the amount smoked.  However, if someone stops smoking, then these chances gradually decrease as the damage to their body is repaired.\n【10】 Diseases linked to smoking tobacco cigarettes include:\n【11】 - Many forms of cancer, particularly lung cancer, cancer of the kidney, cancer of the larynx and head and neck, breast cancer , bladder, esophagus, pancreas, and stomach. There is some evidence suggesting an increased risk of myeloid leukemia, squamous cell sinonasal cancer, liver cancer, cervical cancer, colorectal cancer after an extended latency, childhood cancers and cancers of the gall bladder, adrenal gland and small intestine.\n【12】 - Cardiovascular disease\n【13】 stroke\n【14】 peripheral vascular disease\n【15】 - stroke\n【16】 - peripheral vascular disease\n【17】 - Respiratory ailments\n【18】 common cold and bronchitis\n【19】 Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, emphysema and chronic bronchitis in particular\n【20】 - common cold and bronchitis\n【21】 - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, emphysema and chronic bronchitis in particular\n【22】 - Birth defects of pregnant smokers' offspring\n【23】 - Buerger's disease (thromboangiitis obliterans)\n【24】 - Cataracts that may cause blindness\n【25】 - Cognitive dysfunction\n【26】 increased risk of Alzheimer's disease and decline in cognitive abilities \n【27】 Reduced memory and cognitive abilities in adolescent smokers\n【28】 - increased risk of Alzheimer's disease and decline in cognitive abilities \n【29】 - Reduced memory and cognitive abilities in adolescent smokers\n【30】 - Impotence\n【31】 Cigar and pipe smokers tend to inhale less smoke than cigarette smokers, so their risk of lung cancer is lower but is still several times higher than the risk for nonsmokers. Pipe and cigar smokers are also at risk for cancers of the oral cavity, larynx (voice box), or esophagus, a risk which was widely hypothesized before any link between smoking and cancer was scientifically proved as seen in the news coverage of the tobacco-related cancers of two American presidents; Ulysses S. Grant died in 1885 at age sixty-three after a long and painful public battle with throat cancer which was widely assumed at the time to be the result of his lifelong cigar habit, and  Grover Cleveland was diagnosed in 1893 with cancer of the left jaw, which was frequently remarked upon by the press and public as the side where he usually had a cigar clamped. Similarly, cancer of the mouth and jaw is also a risk for chewing tobacco. The benefits of smoking cessation are immediate: blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature return to normal range; heart attack risk decreases; ability to smell and taste is enhanced; circulation improves.\n【32】 It is generally assumed that the major motivational factor behind smoking is the nicotine it contains. However, the practice of ingesting the smoke from a smoldering leaf generates an enormous number of active chemical compounds, loosely lumped together as 'tar', many of which are biologically reactive and potential health dangers. (Chewing tobacco is also carcinogenic, likely because similar compounds are generated in the practice of curing it; the Nordic snus, which is steam cured and therefore does not generate these compounds, is much less carcinogenic.) There are around 3000 chemicals found in tobacco smoke. \n【33】 Long term exposure to other compounds in the smoke, such as carbon monoxide, cyanide,  and other compounds that damage lung and arterial tissue, are believed to be responsible for cardiovascular damage and for loss of elasticity in the alveoli, leading to emphysema and COPD.\n【34】 ## Radioactive components of tobacco\n【35】 In addition to chemical, nonradioactive carcinogens, tobacco and tobacco smoke contain small amounts of lead-210 (210Pb) and polonium-210 (210Po) both of which are radioactive carcinogens. Lead 210 is a product of the decay of radium-226 and, in turn, its decay product, radon-222; lead 210 then decays to bismuth-210 and then to polonium 210, emitting beta particles in both steps. Tarry particles containing these elements lodge in the smokers' lungs where airflow is disturbed; the concentration found where bronchioles bifurcate is 100 times higher than that in the lungs overall. This gives smokers much more intense exposure than would otherwise be encountered. Polonium 210, for instance, emits high energy alpha particles which, because of their large mass, are considered to be incapable of penetrating the skin more than 40 micrometres deep, but do considerable damage (estimated at 100 times as much chromosome damage as a corresponding amount of other radiation) when a process such as smoking causes them to be emitted within the body, where all their energy is absorbed by surrounding tissue. (Lead 210 also emits gamma rays).\n【36】 The radioactive elements in tobacco are accumulated from the minerals in the soil, as with any plant, but are also captured on the sticky surface of the tobacco leaves in excess of what would be seen with plants not having this property. As might be expected, the radioactivity measured in tobacco varies widely depending on where and how it is grown. One study found that tobacco grown in India averaged only 0.09 pCi per gram of polonium 210, whereas tobacco grown in the United States averaged 0.516 pCi per gram. Another study of Indian tobacco, however, measured an average of 0.4 pCi of polonium 210 per cigarette, which also would be approximately a gram of tobacco. One factor in the difference between India and the United States may be the extensive use of apatite as fertilizer for tobacco in the United States, because it starves the plant for nitrogen, thereby producing more flavorful tobacco; apatite is known to contain radium, lead 210, and polonium 210. This would also account for increased concentration of these elements compared to other crops, which do not use this mineral as fertilizer.\n【37】 The presence of polonium-210 in mainstream cigarette smoke has been experimentally measured at levels of 0.0263 - 0.036 pCi, which is equivalent to about 0.1 pCi per milligram of smoke; or about 0.81 pCi of lead 210 per gram of dry condensed smoke. The amount of polonium 210 inhaled from a pack of 20 cigarettes is therefore about 0.72 pCi. This seems to be independent of any form of filtering or 'low tar' cigarette. This concentration results in a highly significant increase in the body burden of these compounds. Compared to nonsmokers, heavy smokers have four times greater radioisotope density throughout their lungs. The polonium 210 content of blood in smokers averages 1.72 pCi per kilogram, compared to 0.76 pCi per kilogram in nonsmokers. Higher concentrations of polonium 210 are also found in the livers of smokers than nonsmokers. Polonium 210 is also known to be incorporated into bone tissue, where the continued irradiation of bone marrow may be a cause of leukemia, although this has not been proved as yet.\n【38】 Research by NCAR radiochemist Ed Martell determined that radioactive compounds in cigarette smoke are deposited in \"hot spots\" where bronchial tubes branch.  Since tar from cigarette smoke is resistant to dissolving in lung fluid, the radioactive compounds have a great deal of time to undergo radioactive decay before being cleared by natural processes.  Indoors, these radioactive compounds linger in secondhand smoke, and therefore greater exposure occurs when these radioactive compounds are inhaled during normal breathing, which is deeper and longer than when inhaling cigarettes.  Damage to the protective epithelial tissue from smoking only increases the prolonged retention of insoluble polonium 210 compounds produced from burning tobacco.  Martell estimated that a carcinogenic radiation dose of 80-100 rads is delivered the lung tissue of most smokers who die of lung cancer.\n【39】 In other experiments, the alpha particle dosage from polonium 210 received by smokers of two packs a day was measured at 82.5 millirads per day, which would total 752.5 rads per 25 years, 150 times higher than the approximately 5 rem received from natural background radiation over 25 years. Other estimates of the dosage absorbed over 25 years of heavy smoking range from 165 to 1,000 rem, all significantly higher than natural background. In the case of the less radioactive Indian tobacco referred to above, the dosage received from polonium 210 is about 24 millirads a day, totalling 219 rads over 25 years or still about 40 times the natural background radiation exposure. In fact, all these numbers of total body burden are misleadingly low, because the dosage rate in the immediate vicinity of the deposited polonium 210 in the lungs can be from 100 to 10,000 times greater than natural background radiation. Lung cancer is seen in laboratory animals exposed to approximately one fifth of this total dosage of polonium 210.\n【40】 Whether the quantities of these elements are sufficient to cause cancer is still a matter of debate. Most studies of carcinogenicity of tobacco smoke involve painting tar condensed from smoke onto the skin of mice and monitoring for development of tumors of the skin, a relatively simple process. However, the specific properties of polonium 210 and lead 210 and the model for their action, as described above, do not permit such a simple assay and require more difficult studies, requiring dosage of the mice in a manner mimicking smoking behavior of humans and monitoring for lung cancer, more difficult to observe as it is internal to the mouse.\n【41】 Some researchers suggest that the degree of carcinogenicity of these radioactive elements is sufficient to account for most, if not all, cases of lung cancer related to smoking. In support of this hypothetical link between radioactive elements in tobacco and cancer is the observation that bladder cancer incidence is also proportional to the amount of tobacco smoked, even though nonradioactive carcinogens have not been detected in the urine of even heavy smokers; however, urine of smokers contains about six times more polonium 210 than that of nonsmokers, suggesting strongly that the polonium 210 is the cause of the bladder carcinogenicity, and would be expected to act similarly in the lungs and other tissue. Furthermore, many of the lung cancers contracted by cigarette smokers are adenocarcinomas, which are characteristic of the type of damage produced by alpha particle radiation such as that of polonium 210. It has also been suggested that the radioactive and chemical carcinogens in tobacco smoke act synergistically to cause a higher incidence of cancer than each alone.\n【42】 However, the view that polonium 210 is responsible for many cases of cancer in tobacco smokers is disputed by at least one researcher.\n【43】 ## Other chemicals\n【44】 There are over 19 known carcinogens in cigarettes.  The following are some of the most potent carcinogens:\n【45】 - Benzopyrene is a highly carcinogenic and mutagenic compound which is formed during the incomplete combustion of organic matter.  Tobacco manufacturers have experimented with combustionless vaporizer technology to allow cigarettes to be consumed without the formation of carcinogenic benzopyrenes.\n【46】 - Nitrosamine is a \"deadly cancer-causing\" compound found in cigarette smoke but not in uncured tobacco leaves.  Nitrosamine forms on flue-cured tobacco leaves during the curing process through a chemical reaction between nicotine and other compounds contained in the uncured leaf and various oxides of nitrogen found in all combustion gases.  Switching to indirect-fire curing has been shown to reduce nitrosamine levels to less than 0.1 parts per million.\n【47】 ## Nicotine and addiction\n【48】 Nicotine is a powerful stimulant and is one of the main factors leading to the continued tobacco smoking. Although the amount of nicotine inhaled with tobacco smoke is quite small (most of the substance is destroyed by the heat) it is still sufficient to cause physical and/or psychological dependence. The amount of nicotine absorbed by the body from smoking depends on many factors, including the type of tobacco, whether the smoke is inhaled, and whether a filter is used. Despite the design of various cigarettes advertised and even tested on machines to deliver less of the toxic tar, studies show that when smoked by humans instead of machines, they deliver the same net amount of smoke.  Ingesting a compound by smoking is one of the most rapid and efficient methods of introducing it into the bloodstream, second only to injection, which allows for the rapid feedback which supports the smokers' ability to titrate their dosage. On average it takes about ten seconds for the substance to reach the brain. As a result of the efficiency of this delivery system, many smokers feel as though they are unable to cease. Of those who attempt cessation and last three months without succumbing to nicotine, most are able to remain smoke free for the rest of their lives. There exists a possibility of depression in some who attempt cessation, as with other psychoactive substances. Depression is also common in teenage smokers; teens who smoke are four times as likely to develop depressive symptoms as their nonsmoking peers .\n【49】 Although nicotine does play a role in acute episodes of some diseases (including stroke, impotence, and heart disease) by its stimulation of adrenaline release, which raises blood pressure, heart rate, and free fatty acids, the most serious longer term effects are more the result of the products of the smouldering combustion process. This has enabled development of various nicotine delivery systems, such as the nicotine patch or nicotine gum, that can satisfy the addictive craving by delivering nicotine without the harmful combustion by-products. This can help the heavily dependent smoker to quit gradually, while discontinuing further damage to health.\n【50】 ## Smoking and cardiovascular disease\n【51】 Smoking also increases the chance of heart disease. Several ingredients of tobacco lead to the narrowing of blood vessels, increasing the likelihood of a blockage, and thus a heart attack or stroke. According to a study by an international team of researchers, people under 40 are five times more likely to have a heart attack if they smoke.\n【52】 Other tobacco chemicals lead to high blood pressure. Also, some chemicals may damage the inside of arteries, for example making it possible for cholesterol to adhere to the artery wall, possibly leading to a heart attack.\n【53】 ## Effect of smoking on oral health\n【54】 It is generally accepted among the general public that smoking can have devastating effects on the cardiovascular system and other important organs in the body, though the effects on the oral cavity are generally underestimated. Perhaps the most serious oral condition that can arise from tobacco smoking is that of oral cancer. However, smoking also increases the risk for various other oral diseases, some of which are almost completely exclusive to smokers.\n【55】 Smoking has been proven to be an important factor in the staining of teeth. Halitosis is common among tobacco smokers. Other oral diseases that are known to have strong links to smoking are leukoplakia, Snuff Dipper's lesions and smoker's palate. Currently, there is growing evidence that tobacco greatly increases the risk of periodontal diseases, which includes bone and tooth loss. In addition, many smokers report a loss of taste sensation and/or salivary changes.\n【56】 ## Physical and psychological effects on smokers\n【57】 Smokers report a variety of physical and psychological effects from smoking tobacco.  Those new to smoking will experience nausea, dizziness, and rapid heart beat.  The unpleasant symptoms will eventually vanish over time, with repeated use, as the body builds a tolerance to the chemicals in the cigarettes, such as nicotine.\n【58】 In many respects, nicotine acts on the nervous system in a similar way to caffeine.  Some writings have stated that smoking can also increase mental concentration; one study documents a significantly better IQ on the normed Advanced Raven Progressive Matrices test after smoking. Most smokers say they enjoy smoking, which is part of the reason why many continue to do so even though they are aware of the health risks. Taste, smell, and visual enjoyment are also major contributions to the enjoyment of smoking, in addition to camaraderie with other smokers. Paradoxically, chronic exposure to tobacco smoke inhibits one's sense of taste and smell, rendering him or her unable to enjoy these aspects of tobacco smoking.\n【59】 Most smokers, when denied access to nicotine, exhibit symptoms such as irritability, jitteriness, dry mouth, and rapid heart beat. Longer abstinence may lead to insomnia and even mild depression. The onset of these symptoms is very fast, nicotine's half-life being only 1 hour. Withdrawal symptoms can appear even if the smoker's consumption is very limited or irregular, appearing after only 4-5 cigarettes in most adolescents. An ex-smoker's chemical dependence to nicotine will cease after approximately ten to twenty days, although the brain's number of nicotine receptors is permanently altered, and the psychological dependence may linger for months or even many years.  Unlike illicit recreational drugs and alcohol, nicotine does not measurably alter a smoker's motor skills, cognition, judgement, or language abilities while under the influence of the drug, but nicotine withdrawal symptoms such as irritability and incapacity to concentrate can have an influence on these aspects. Tobacco withdrawal has been shown to cause clinically significant distress.\n【60】 The majority of these effects are due to nicotine withdrawal, and so smokers who are not addicted to nicotine will not suffer from them.\n【61】 Some studies suggest that a link exists between smoking and mental illness, citing the high incidence of smoking amongst those suffering from schizophrenia and the possibility that smoking may alleviate some of the symptoms of mental illness, but these have not been conclusive.\n【62】 ## Tobacco and reproduction\n【63】 ### Effects of smoking on sperm cells\n【64】 There is increasing evidence that the harmful products of tobacco smoking kill sperm cells.  Therefore, some governments require manufacturers to put warnings on packets.\n【65】 ### Spontaneous abortion\n【66】 A number of studies have shown that tobacco use is a significant factor in spontaneous abortions among pregnant smokers, and that it contributes to a number of other threats to the health of the fetus. Second-hand smoke appears to present an equal danger to the fetus, as one study noted that \"heavy paternal smoking increased the risk of early pregnancy loss.\"\n【67】 ### SIDS\n【68】 Secondhand smoke is connected to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). Infants who die from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome tend to have higher concentrations of nicotine and cotinine (a biological marker for secondhand smoke exposure) in their lungs than those who die from other causes. While smoking during pregnancy increases the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, infants exposed to secondhand smoke after birth are also at a greater risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome whether or not the parent(s) smoked during pregnancy.\n【69】 ## Epidemiology of smoking\n【70】 A team of British scientists headed by Richard Doll carried out a longitudinal study of 34,439 medical specialists from 1951 to 2001, generally called the \"British doctors study.\" The study demonstrated that smoking decreased life expectancy by 10 years and that almost half of the smokers died from diseases possibly caused by smoking (cancer, heart disease, and stroke). About 5,900 of the study participants are still alive and only 134 of them still smoke.\n【71】 In the UK, the impact of smoking is felt most keenly by the lower social classes, which are known to have worse life expectancy than those better off. Half the difference in survival to age 70 between social classes I and V is estimated to be due to the higher smoking prevalence in the lower class group.\n【72】 # Risks by kind of tobacco\n【73】 ## Low Tar/Light Cigarettes\n【74】 There is no credible evidence that \"Low Tar,\" \"Light,\" or \"Ultra Light\" cigarettes are safer than regular cigarettes.\n【75】 Most of these terms refer to the type of filter that is used, and can vary depending on the brand.\n【76】 ## Cigar vs Cigarette Smoking\n【77】 Many people believe that, because cigar smokers do not inhale, cigar smoking is innocuous or less dangerous than cigarette smoking. However, most scientific evidence is at odds with that impression. The National Institutes of Health, through the National Cancer Institute, determined in 1998 that \"cigar smoking causes a variety of cancers including cancers of the oral cavity (lip, tongue, mouth, throat), esophagus, larynx, and lung.\" The study concerned those who smoked at least one cigar per day, and stated \"The health risks associated with less than daily smoking (occasional smokers) are not known.\" Although the study reports that most cigar smokers do not inhale, some smokers do inhale, particularly former cigarette smokers who have switched to cigars. This yields risks of lung cancer similar to cigarette smokers. As for Environmental Tobacco Smoke (ETS, or \"Second-hand Smoking\"), the study points to the large amount of smoke generated by one cigar, saying \"cigars can contribute substantial amounts of tobacco smoke to the indoor environment; and, when large numbers of cigar smokers congregate together in a cigar smoking event, the amount of ETS produced is sufficient to be a health concern for those regularly required to work in those environments.\"\n【78】 ## Pipe smoking\n【79】 Pipe smoking involves significant health risks  , particularly oral cancer .\n【80】 # Beneficial effects of smoking\n【81】 Tobacco has sometimes been reported to have isolated positive effects on certain medical conditions, presumably due to the biological effects of nicotine. Most notably, some studies have found that patients with Alzheimer's disease are more likely not to have smoked than the general population, which has been interpreted to suggest that smoking offers some protection against Alzheimer's.  However, the research in this area is limited and the results are conflicting; some studies show that smoking increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease.  A recent review of the available scientific literature concluded that the apparent decrease in Alzheimer risk may be simply due to the fact that smokers tend to die before reaching the age at which Alzheimer normally occurs. \"Differential mortality is always likely to be a problem where there is a need to investigate the effects of smoking in a disorder with very low incidence rates before age 75 years, which is the case of Alzheimer's disease,\" it stated, noting that smokers are only half as likely as non-smokers to survive to the age of 80.\n【82】 Some studies have found that smoking is associated with:\n【83】 - A protective effect of current smoking in Parkinson's disease, although the authors stated that it was more likely that the movement disorders which are part of Parkinson's disease prevented people from being able to smoke than that smoking itself was protective.\n【84】 - A protective effect of current smoking against ulcerative colitis, although smoking increases the risk of Crohn's disease, the other form of inflammatory bowel disease.\n【85】 - A reduced risk of Kaposi's sarcoma in people without HIV infection..\n【86】 - There is some evidence for decreased rates of endometriosis in infertile women, although other studies have found that smoking increases the risk in infertile women. There is little or no evidence of a protective effect in fertile women.\n【87】 - Some preliminary data from 1996 suggested a reduced incidence of uterine fibroids, but overall the evidence is unconvincing.\n【88】 - There is limited evidence that smoking reduces the incidence of pregnancy-induced hypertension, but not when the pregnancy is with more than one baby (i.e. it has no effect on twins etc.). Smoking does, however, increase the likelihood of almost every other pregnancy-related health risk to both mother and child, and is the single most preventable cause of illness and death among mothers and infants in the developed world.\n【89】 - A very large percentage of schizophrenics smoke tobacco as a form of self medication. The high rate of tobacco use by the mentally ill is a major factor in their decreased life expectancy, which is about 25 years shorter than the general population.\n【90】 # Incidental problems\n【91】 An indirect public health problem posed by cigarettes is that of accidental fires, usually linked with consumption of alcohol. Numerous cigarette designs have been proposed, some by tobacco companies themselves, which would extinguish a cigarette left unattended for more than a minute or two, thereby reducing the risk of fire. However the tobacco companies have historically resisted this idea, on the grounds that the nuisance involved in having to relight a cigarette left untouched for too long would reduce their sales.
