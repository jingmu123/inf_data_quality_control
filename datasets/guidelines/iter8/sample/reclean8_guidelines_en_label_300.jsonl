It is recommended only if:\nthey have previously had ruxolitinib and the conditions in the managed access agreement for fedratinib are followed.\nThis recommendation is not intended to affect treatment with fedratinib that was started in the NHS before this guidance was published. People having treatment outside this recommendation may continue without change to the funding arrangements in place for them before this guidance was published, until they and their NHS clinician consider it appropriate to stop.\nWhy the committee made these recommendations\nMost people with higher-risk myelofibrosis have ruxolitinib, and continue having it even if their disease does not fully respond, or stops responding. After ruxolitinib is stopped, people can have best available therapy, which includes chemotherapy, radiation therapy, splenectomy or red blood cell transfusion. The company proposes that fedratinib would only be used after ruxolitinib, which is more restrictive than its marketing authorisation.\nClinical trial evidence for people who have stopped ruxolitinib suggests that fedratinib improves myelofibrosis symptoms and reduces spleen size. However, this evidence is uncertain because fedratinib was not compared with best available therapy and some people did not finish the trial. Fedratinib has been compared indirectly with best available therapy using evidence from other studies. There is further uncertainty because of some differences between the trial populations in the indirect comparison.\nAlso, it is unclear how much longer people having fedratinib live compared with best available therapy, and this has a large effect on the cost-effectiveness results. There is also uncertainty around how many people would continue having fedratinib if their disease does not fully respond, or stops responding.\nFedratinib does not meet NICE's criteria to be considered a life-extending treatment at the end of life based on the evidence currently available. The cost-effectiveness estimates for fedratinib compared with best available therapy are uncertain because of limitations in the data. Because some of these estimates are higher than what NICE normally considers an acceptable use of NHS resources, fedratinib cannot be recommended for routine use in the NHS. Collecting more data on overall survival and treatment duration will reduce the uncertainty in the evidence. Therefore, fedratinib is recommended for use in the Cancer Drugs Fund\n\n【3】 #Information about fedratinib\n\n【4】 #Marketing authorisation indication\nFedratinib (Inrebic, Celgene) has a marketing authorisation for 'the treatment of disease-related splenomegaly or symptoms in adult patients with primary myelofibrosis, post-polycythaemia vera myelofibrosis or post-essential thrombocythaemia myelofibrosis who are Janus Associated Kinase (JAK) inhibitor naive or have been treated with ruxolitinib'.\n\n【5】 #Dosage in the marketing authorisation\nThe dosage schedule is available in the summary of product characteristics.\n\n【6】 The list price of fedratinib is £6,120 for a 120‑capsule pack of 100 mg capsules (excluding VAT; BNF online accessed September 2021). The company has a commercial arrangement. This makes fedratinib available to the NHS with a discount. The size of the discount is commercial in confidenc\n\n【7】 #Committee discussion\n\n【8】 Whether there was an overall survival benefit for fedratinib over best available therapy .\nWhich was the most appropriate model of time to treatment discontinuation for fedratinib .\nHow the transformation rate to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) should be modelled for people having fedratinib .\n\n【9】 ## People with myelofibrosis often experience severe symptoms\nMyelofibrosis is a rare haematological disorder that often causes an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly) and constitutional symptoms, and shortens life. The patient experts explained that people with myelofibrosis experience debilitating fatigue, pain from splenomegaly, severe itching, night sweats, bone pain, and mental health problems including depression. Many people with myelofibrosis must reduce working hours or stop working completely because of fatigue. The patient experts added that the combined symptom burden can be very intense, and people can become dependent on carers. They also noted that people with myelofibrosis may be unable to exercise and that lack of exercise could contribute to other health issues. Around 75% of people with myelofibrosis reported experiencing depression or low mood. The patient experts explained the fear of living with a disease that is incurable for most people. They explained that knowing there are limited treatment options adds to their worry. They would like a new treatment option to increase life expectancy and improve quality of life. The committee concluded that people with myelofibrosis often have a high symptom burden. Improving survival and the symptoms associated with myelofibrosis, particularly fatigue and itching, would greatly benefit the wellbeing of people with myelofibrosis and their families.\n\n【10】 ## People with myelofibrosis would welcome a new treatment option, particularly when ruxolitinib is no longer suitable\nMyelofibrosis has 4 different risk categories according to the Dynamic International Prognostic Scoring System (DIPSS): low, intermediate‑1, intermediate‑2 and high risk. Clinicians can use these risk scores to guide treatment. People without symptoms or who have low-risk disease may have their myelofibrosis observed without active treatment. Most people with intermediate‑2 or high-risk disease have ruxolitinib, which was recommended in NICE's technology appraisal guidance on ruxolitinib for treating disease-related splenomegaly or symptoms in adults with primary or secondary myelofibrosis (from now, TA386). The rest have best available therapy, which comprises several treatment options including hydroxycarbamide, androgens, radiation therapy, and red blood cell transfusion. The clinical experts explained that peoples' experiences with ruxolitinib varied. Ruxolitinib may work well at first, but many people experience disease relapse. People having ruxolitinib often have side effects which can mean they have to stop treatment. The clinical and patient experts also explained that best available therapy has limited effectiveness. This means that many people continue having suboptimal ruxolitinib treatment even if the disease does not respond or subsequently loses response, because there are no other effective treatment options. However, disease symptoms will usually return for people having suboptimal ruxolitinib. When ruxolitinib is no longer suitable there are no other options other than best available therapy. The committee agreed that patients and clinicians would welcome a new treatment option for myelofibrosis, particularly when ruxolitinib is no longer suitable.\n\n【11】 ## The company's positioning of fedratinib for people with intermediate-2 or high-risk myelofibrosis who have had ruxolitinib is appropriate\nFedratinib's marketing authorisation covers people with primary or secondary myelofibrosis (regardless of risk category) who have either not had a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, or had ruxolitinib. However, the company positioned fedratinib in people with intermediate‑2 or high‑risk disease who have had ruxolitinib. The company considered this positioning reflected an area of unmet need and was how clinicians would use fedratinib in clinical practice. People who have had ruxolitinib have few treatment options . So, the committee concluded that it was appropriate to appraise fedratinib for intermediate‑2 or high‑risk myelofibrosis after ruxolitinib.\n\n【12】 ## The company's mixed comparator is acceptable, but the evidence for best available therapy in the model should reflect the proportion of people assumed to have ruxolitinib\nThe comparator in the NICE scope for people who had previous treatment with ruxolitinib, or when ruxolitinib was not appropriate, was established clinical practice, also called best available therapy. This included hydroxycarbamide, other chemotherapies, androgens, splenectomy, radiation therapy, erythropoietin and red blood cell transfusion. In the company's economic model , around 89% of people having best available therapy were assumed to have ruxolitinib. The ERG considered that the company should have split the population in its model into 2 subgroups: people who would have continued having suboptimal ruxolitinib, and people who would have stopped having ruxolitinib altogether. This was supported by the feedback from clinical experts. The clinical experts commented that most people whose disease is relapsed or refractory to ruxolitinib would keep having it, but people for whom ruxolitinib is poorly tolerated would usually stop having it. The ERG noted that the 2 subgroups would have different comparators. The comparator for the first group would be ruxolitinib, and the comparator for the second group would be best available therapy without ruxolitinib. The ERG considered that separating the population in this way would have helped to interpret the results. However, the company stated that it was not possible to split the trial population into the groups suggested by the ERG. The company also noted that there were no internationally recognised criteria for defining these groups, and they could therefore overlap. The comparator included a mix of people having ruxolitinib and people having best available therapy without ruxolitinib. The committee agreed that this mixed comparator was acceptable, but noted that the evidence used for best available therapy in the model should reflect the proportion of people assumed to have ruxolitinib .\n\n【13】 ## JAKARTA-2 is generalisable to people in the NHS with myelofibrosis who would have fedratinib\nThe evidence for fedratinib came from JAKARTA‑2, a single-arm, open-label, phase 2 study. The study included 97 adults with intermediate or high-risk primary myelofibrosis, post-polycythaemia vera myelofibrosis, or post-essential thrombocythaemia myelofibrosis that was deemed resistant to ruxolitinib after at least 14 days of treatment, or who were intolerant to ruxolitinib after any duration of treatment. Of these people, 81 had intermediate‑2 or high-risk disease, corresponding to where the company positioned fedratinib . The dose of fedratinib used in the study was 400 mg per day for 6 consecutive 28‑day cycles (24 weeks). The daily dose could be increased to up to 600 mg within the first 6 cycles if there was a reduction in spleen size by palpation of less than 50% at the end of cycles 2 and 4. The primary outcome was spleen response, defined as the proportion of people with a spleen volume reduction of 35% or more from baseline at the end of cycle 6. Secondary outcomes included: symptom response (the proportion of people with a reduction in total symptom score of 50% or more from baseline to the end of cycle 6), the proportion of people with a reduction in palpable spleen length of 50% or more from baseline to the end of cycle 6, spleen response at the end of cycle 3 (12 weeks), percentage change in spleen volume from baseline to the end of cycles 3 and 6, and safety. The clinical experts noted that the inclusion criteria for JAKARTA‑2 were quite unrestricted, and that the study would be generalisable to the NHS in England. The committee concluded that JAKARTA‑2 was generalisable to people in the NHS with myelofibrosis who would have fedratinib.\n\n【14】 ## Fedratinib is clinically effective, but the lack of comparator data makes assessing comparative effectiveness challenging\nIn November 2013, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US put a clinical hold on fedratinib because of 8 suspected cases of Wernicke's encephalopathy. During the clinical hold, people stopped having fedratinib while the suspected cases of Wernicke's encephalopathy were investigated. The clinical hold meant that 13 people in JAKARTA‑2 stopped having fedratinib before they reached cycle 6 because of the study being stopped early. Also, during the marketing authorisation process, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) requested additional analyses of JAKARTA‑2 because of uncertainty around the additional benefits from increasing the fedratinib daily dose above 400 mg. The company therefore submitted analyses that counted disease response with a daily dose of more than 400 mg as not responding. This CHMP definition of response was used in the company and ERG analyses in the model. In the JAKARTA‑2 intention-to-treat population, 23% of people had a spleen response while having a maximum daily dose of 400 mg. The proportion of people who had a symptom response in the intention-to-treat population while having a maximum daily dose of 400 mg was 21%. The ERG noted that the absence of a control arm in JAKARTA‑2 meant that it was possible that there was regression to the mean effects. This is when extreme values return to average over time. The committee acknowledged the difficulty of collecting data for rare diseases. It concluded that fedratinib is clinically effective, but that the disruption to the trial and lack of comparative data made the assessment of comparative effectiveness challenging.\n\n【15】 ## Fedratinib has manageable adverse events\nThe company noted that the adverse event rates from JAKARTA‑2 were generally low. The most common non-haematological adverse events for people having fedratinib were gastrointestinal disorders including diarrhoea (62%), nausea (56%), and vomiting (41%). The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were haematological and included anaemia (38%) and thrombocytopenia (22%). Treatment-emergent adverse events that meant fedratinib was stopped were seen in 20% of people. Across all fedratinib studies there were 8 suspected cases of Wernicke's encephalopathy, 1 of which had a clear diagnosis. It was found to be a consequence of gastrointestinal adverse events in people who were undernourished. Wernicke's encephalopathy can be managed by monitoring thiamine levels and supplementing as needed. The clinical experts noted that they follow the summary of product characteristics for monitoring thiamine levels and making dose adjustments. The company confirmed that there have been no additional instances of Wernicke's encephalopathy since the end of the FDA's clinical hold. The committee concluded that fedratinib has a manageable adverse event profile.\n\n【16】 ## The indirect treatment comparison suggests fedratinib improves response compared with best available therapy, but there are uncertainties\nIn the absence of direct head-to-head evidence comparing the efficacy of fedratinib with best available therapy, the company did a matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) for spleen or symptom response . The company used evidence from the intermediate‑2 or high-risk group from JAKARTA‑2 (n=81) for fedratinib and evidence from the SIMPLIFY‑2 trial (n=52) for best available therapy. SIMPLIFY‑2 was a randomised trial comparing momelotinib with best available therapy in people whose myelofibrosis had a suboptimal response to ruxolitinib, or who had haematological toxic effects with ruxolitinib. The company's base-case MAIC was adjusted for DIPSS risk category  and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status. The company chose these variables based on clinical input that they were prognostic, and that there was a meaningful imbalance between JAKARTA‑2 and the best available therapy arm from SIMPLIFY‑2. The results of the MAIC suggested that fedratinib improves response compared with best available therapy, but the exact values are confidential and cannot be reported here. The ERG commented that ignoring variables because they were balanced individually may not achieve balance between the study populations overall. It noted that people in SIMPLIFY‑2 could be currently having ruxolitinib (which was not the case in JAKARTA‑2), and that this difference could not be adjusted for in the MAIC. Differences in how symptom response was assessed between JAKARTA‑2 and SIMPLIFY‑2 and the absence of a washout period in SIMPLIFY‑2 may also have favoured fedratinib. The committee agreed that the MAIC suggests fedratinib improves response compared with best available therapy, but there was considerable uncertainty around these results.\n\n【17】 ## The company's model is similar to that from TA386, but a simpler model structure may have been more robust for decision making\nThe company submitted an individual patient discrete event simulation model comparing fedratinib with best available therapy. This was similar to the approach used in TA386. The company considered this design to be more flexible and transparent compared with a Markov cohort approach. The model had 5 health states . This gave similar results to the company's base case. The company further noted that a simpler model could have created separate issues. The ERG's view of the model remained unchanged after consultation. At its second meeting, the committee noted that the company had made few changes to the model presented at the first committee meeting. It reiterated its conclusion from the first committee meeting that a simpler model structure may have been more robust for decision making.\n\n【18】 ## Using different  to model best available therapy increases uncertainty\nThe company used a range of evidence sources for best available therapy in its model. For its base case, the company used the data from SIMPLIFY‑2 for the spleen or symptom response MAIC , for the adverse event frequency for best available therapy as a comparator, and for the composition of best available therapy. Although overall survival data for people having best available therapy was available from SIMPLIFY‑2, the company did not use that in its base case. Instead, it used evidence from people who had stopped having ruxolitinib from Schain et al. 2019 (n=71). This was a retrospective observational study of people with myelofibrosis in Sweden and Norway, which the company considered best represented the people likely to have fedratinib in the NHS. The ERG noted that Schain included more people with primary myelofibrosis than JAKARTA‑2, and the population was also older on average. Therefore, the ERG expected people in Schain to have a worse prognosis than those in JAKARTA‑2. The ERG had additional concerns with comparing survival data from an observational study (Schain) with a clinical trial (JAKARTA‑2). It also considered that SIMPLIFY‑2 was a more appropriate  for best available therapy to align costs and outcomes in the model. This was because nobody in Schain had ruxolitinib, and so it did not reflect the composition of best available therapy from SIMPLIFY‑2 (in which around 89% of people had ruxolitinib). The company used evidence from people who stopped having ruxolitinib (n=39) in COMFORT‑2 for the adverse event frequency for people having best available therapy after fedratinib. COMFORT‑2 was a randomised phase 3 trial comparing ruxolitinib with best available therapy in people with myelofibrosis. The company also used the data from the best available therapy arm of COMFORT‑2 (n=73) to model the rate of transformation to AML for people having fedratinib and for people having best available therapy . Finally, the company used evidence from the HMRN to inform the model of time to treatment discontinuation for people having best available therapy. The HMRN measured treatment outcomes in people with primary or secondary myelofibrosis in the Yorkshire and the Humber and Yorkshire Coast Cancer Networks between September 2004 and August 2017. The ERG was concerned that the populations in SIMPLIFY‑2, COMFORT‑2, Schain, and the HMRN were different in terms of age, risk score, and the types of best available therapy options that people were having. It was also concerned that the company did not use evidence sources consistently in its model. The committee agreed that using different  to model best available therapy was inappropriate and increased uncertainty. The comparator in the company's model was comprised mainly of people having ruxolitinib , and the evidence used for best available therapy should reflect this.\n\n【19】 ## Fedratinib is likely to extend survival, but the extent of the survival benefit is highly uncertain\nTo model survival after stopping treatment for people having fedratinib, the company fitted parametric models to the JAKARTA‑2 intermediate‑2 or high-risk subgroup survival data after stopping treatment, split by response status at week 24. Based on clinical expert advice, the company considered a Weibull distribution to be the most plausible distribution for people whose disease did respond and those whose disease did not respond. The company also noted that the Weibull distribution provided a conservative survival estimate for fedratinib. For best available therapy, the company fitted a Weibull distribution to the overall survival data from Schain for people who stopped having ruxolitinib. The company's base-case model predicted a mean overall survival benefit for fedratinib of 6.2 months based on the naive comparison of overall survival from JAKARTA‑2 and Schain. However, the ERG had concerns with using the overall survival data from Schain . It considered that the observed survival benefit could be because the company had used different modelling approaches for the 2 treatment arms. The ERG requested that the company do an exploratory MAIC for overall survival using evidence from JAKARTA‑2 and SIMPLIFY‑2. It noted that after matching based on DIPSS risk category, the overall survival for people having fedratinib was similar to that for people having best available therapy. The ERG also noted that after adjusting for other prognostic factors such as platelet count and transfusion dependence in the MAIC, people having fedratinib had a shorter overall survival than those having best available therapy. The company considered that the overall survival data from SIMPLIFY‑2 was not reliable because of discrepancies in the data reported. It also noted that overall survival was not a pre-specified outcome in SIMPLIFY‑2, and that people could switch from best available therapy to momelotinib after 24 weeks. The company highlighted that there was evidence to suggest that spleen response is linked to overall survival. As such, fedratinib could be expected to have an overall survival benefit based on the results of the company's MAIC for spleen or symptom response . The clinical experts agreed, stating that there is real-world and clinical trial evidence linking spleen response to overall survival. They considered that it was implausible that fedratinib would have no overall survival benefit over best available therapy. At its first meeting, the committee considered that fedratinib was likely to extend overall survival, but the extent of this overall survival benefit was highly uncertain. In response to consultation, the company highlighted 4 studies that quantified the association between spleen response and improved survival. The ERG noted that the company did not use spleen response as a surrogate for survival in its base-case model8, there did not appear to be a survival benefit for fedratinib. The committee was concerned that the population in Schain, where people had stopped ruxolitinib treatment, did not reflect the modelled best available therapy arm, where most people continued ruxolitinib treatment. It considered that it had not seen sufficient evidence to change its conclusion from the first meeting. It felt that fedratinib was likely to extend overall survival compared with best available therapy. However, it concluded that based on the evidence presented, the extent of this overall survival benefit was highly uncertain.\n\n【20】 ## The fedratinib extrapolations for time to treatment discontinuation are uncertain, but are not a main driver of the cost-effectiveness results\nThe company fitted several parametric models to the time to treatment discontinuation data from JAKARTA‑2 and identified the exponential curve for disease response and the log-normal curve for disease non-response as the most appropriate. The ERG noted that the choice of distribution was very uncertain because of the small sample size and short follow up, and was confounded by the clinical hold and CHMP response definition for JAKARTA‑2 . The ERG added that other distributions were also equally plausible, and provided a scenario analysis assuming a Gompertz distribution for both disease response and non-response. The committee understood the limitations with the JAKARTA‑2 evidence, but noted that the models for time to fedratinib discontinuation were not among the main drivers of the cost-effectiveness results.\n\n【21】 ## The proportion of people staying on ruxolitinib in the model after their disease stops responding (89%) should also apply to fedratinib, for consistency\nIn its model presented at the first committee meeting, the company assumed that people having fedratinib would stop having it after their disease stops responding. They would then have best available therapy (without ruxolitinib) or supportive care, or both, until death. In contrast, the company assumed that most people (89%) starting best available therapy in the model were having ruxolitinib, in a population that had already had ruxolitinib . The ERG considered that in NHS clinical practice, most people whose disease was relapsed or refractory to fedratinib would keep having it, or would switch back to ruxolitinib. It presented scenarios assuming the same proportion of people (89%) would keep having fedratinib or switch back to ruxolitinib as were having ruxolitinib in the best available therapy arm. The clinical experts noted that the treatment assumptions after fedratinib were hard to comment on because fedratinib is not used in current clinical practice. They agreed that most people were likely to continue having fedratinib even if their disease had not responded adequately, consistent with how ruxolitinib is used in practice. The clinical lead for the Cancer Drugs Fund noted that it was unlikely that NHS England would commission ruxolitinib after fedratinib, given that people switched to fedratinib because of insufficient disease response or intolerance to ruxolitinib. At its first meeting, the committee considered that most people with relapsed or refractory disease would continue having fedratinib, similar to how people currently keep having ruxolitinib because there are no other treatment options. In response to consultation, the company updated its model base case with the assumption that 65% of people whose disease responded to fedratinib would continue having fedratinib after their disease stops responding. This was calculated based on the discontinuation rate in JAKARTA‑2 up to the end of cycle 6. The ERG noted that the company's updated assumption for fedratinib was inconsistent with the best available therapy arm, in which 89% of people continued ruxolitinib treatment until supportive care or death. The company commented on the proportion of time spent on a JAK inhibitor in each arm, but the values are confidential and cannot be reported here. The ERG presented 2 further scenarios. The scenarios assumed that 65% or 89%, respectively, of all people starting fedratinib would keep having it after their disease stops responding. This was regardless of whether their disease initially responded at 24 weeks. The committee understood that in practice clinicians would likely be reluctant to stop fedratinib even if the disease does not fully respond, or stops responding. This was because there would be no other treatment options. The committee concluded that it was appropriate to assume that 89% of all people starting fedratinib would continue fedratinib after their disease stops responding. This was consistent with the proportion who were assumed to continue ruxolitinib in the best available therapy arm.\n\n【22】 ## People having fedratinib should be assumed to have the same AML transformation rate as people having best available therapy\nMyelofibrosis can transform into AML. The company modelled AML as an adverse event, with an associated cost and quality-of-life impact. In its model presented at the first committee meeting, the company used evidence from the JAKARTA‑2 intermediate‑2 or high-risk subgroup to inform the AML transformation for people having fedratinib. For people having best available therapy, the company used evidence from COMFORT‑2 . The ERG commented that the same AML transformation rate should be used for fedratinib and best available therapy, because it is unclear whether fedratinib treatment affects AML transformation. The ERG added that it was more appropriate to use evidence from COMFORT‑2 to inform the AML transformation rate for both fedratinib and best available therapy arms. This was because COMFORT‑2 had a longer follow up than JAKARTA‑2. The committee considered that there was insufficient evidence to tell whether fedratinib affects the rate of AML transformation. It concluded that it was appropriate to assume the same AML transformation rate for fedratinib as for people having best available therapy. In response to consultation, the company updated its base case to assume the same AML transformation rate for both arms, consistent with the committee preference.\n\n【23】 ## It is appropriate to use the platelet count distribution from JAKARTA-2 to estimate the cost of ruxolitinib\nRuxolitinib dose depends on platelet count. People with a platelet count of less than 100×109/litre have a lower dose of ruxolitinib, which costs less. In its model, the company based the proportion of people having the lower ruxolitinib dose in the best available therapy arm on the platelet count distribution from JAKARTA‑2. The ERG noted that mean platelet count in JAKARTA‑2 was higher than that reported in SIMPLIFY‑2, from which the company used the data for best available therapy in the indirect treatment comparison for response . The ERG considered that the cost of ruxolitinib had therefore been overestimated by the company. The company noted that although the proportion of people with a platelet count of less than 100×109/litre was not reported from SIMPLIFY‑2, around 27% of patients were having a 5 mg dose 2 times per day or less. This was lower than the proportion based on the platelet count distribution from JAKARTA‑2, suggesting that the cost of ruxolitinib had been underestimated in the model rather than overestimated. In response to consultation, the company provided baseline characteristics from a global chart review to support its argument that people having best available therapy have poor survival outcomes . These baseline characteristics included the proportion of people with a platelet count of less than 100×109/litre. The ERG noted that this proportion was higher than in JAKARTA‑2, and considered that it was more likely to resemble the distribution in SIMPLIFY‑2 than JAKARTA‑2 did The company reiterated that it considered that the cost of ruxolitinib had been underestimated in the model, and that basing the platelet count distribution on the global chart review would further underestimate its cost. The company also noted that using the global chart review to inform the proportion of people having the lower ruxolitinib dose would mean that costs and outcomes in the model would not be aligned, because this data was available from SIMPLIFY‑2. The committee understood that there was uncertainty as to which platelet count distribution should be used in the model. It noted the company's concerns with using the global chart review to inform ruxolitinib costs. It concluded that, on balance, the platelet count distribution from JAKARTA‑2 was appropriate to use to estimate the cost of ruxolitinib.\n\n【24】 ## It is appropriate to consider scenarios with and without drug wastage for ruxolitinib\nThe company base-case model included an additional 5% drug wastage for ruxolitinib, in line with the ERG preference in TA386. The ERG considered this inappropriate because in TA386 the clinical experts advised that assuming no drug wastage for ruxolitinib reflected its use in clinical practice. As such, the ERG preferred to exclude ruxolitinib wastage from the model. In response to consultation, the company did not update its base case. The company indicated that informal discussions with clinicians supported that drug wastage would happen for ruxolitinib in clinical practice. The ERG speculated that there could be less ruxolitinib wastage in the second-line setting because more people would have the 5 mg dose. It also reiterated that the cost of ruxolitinib could already be overestimated in the model . The committee was aware that including drug wastage for ruxolitinib had a large effect on the cost-effectiveness results in some scenarios. It acknowledged the uncertainty, and concluded that it was appropriate to consider scenarios with and without drug wastage for ruxolitinib.\n\n【25】 ## Fedratinib does not meet the end of life criteria based on the evidence currently available\nThe committee considered the advice about life-extending treatments for people with a short life expectancy in NICE's guide to the methods of technology appraisal. The clinical experts explained that life expectancy for people who stop ruxolitinib is around 12 to 18 months. They noted that most people in JAKARTA‑2 had died within 2 to 3 years of stopping fedratinib, even though most had retreatment with ruxolitinib. The committee was aware that median overall survival after stopping ruxolitinib was 16 months or less in COMFORT‑2, Schain and based on the HMRN data. However, it noted that the company base-case model predicted that people having best available therapy had a mean life expectancy of 28.7 months. The company explained that the Weibull distribution it had used to extrapolate overall survival for people having best available therapy  gave an optimistic survival prediction. Selecting a more conservative exponential model resulted in a mean life expectancy of less than 24 months. The ERG base case assumed no survival difference , so people having best available therapy had the same life expectancy as people having fedratinib (34.9 months). At its first meeting, the committee concluded that there was considerable uncertainty about whether people having best available therapy would have a life expectancy of less than 24 months. There was also uncertainty about the extent of fedratinib's survival benefit over best available therapy . In response to consultation, the company noted that the high-risk disease group in TA386 met the end of life criteria. Because 42% of the modelled population were high risk, the company indicated that these people should therefore meet the end of life criteria for consistency with TA386. The company added that because the Kaplan–Meier data from Schain was immature, the median survival was more appropriate than the mean survival to inform the life expectancy criterion. The company also provided baseline characteristics for a global chart review that it considered showed poor survival outcomes for people having best available therapy (including ruxolitinib). The company believed that these baseline characteristics were similar to JAKARTA‑2. The ERG noted that the survival estimates discussed at the first committee meeting (from COMFORT‑2, Schain and the HMRN data) were from people who had stopped ruxolitinib treatment, but in the best available therapy arm in the model 89% of people were having ruxolitinib At its second meeting, the committee discussed the survival estimates from clinicians that the company had used to select its survival model for people having best available therapy. It understood that the company had originally asked clinicians for their estimates of survival for when people had stopped having ruxolitinib, rather than for when most people were having suboptimal ruxolitinib. There was also some variability around the clinician responses. The committee noted that the 2 distributions selected as clinically plausible by the company (Weibull and exponential) lay on either side of the clinician estimates, and it would have preferred to see a scenario with a survival model fitted directly through these estimates. Because this would lie above the exponential distribution (which gave a mean survival of 23.3 months), the committee considered that it was likely that this scenario would give a mean survival of more than 24 months. The committee also noted that because the cost-effectiveness results are calculated based on mean (rather than median) values, it is important to consider the mean survival results when assessing if the end of life criteria were met. The committee considered that it had not seen robust enough evidence to conclude that fedratinib met either of the criteria to be considered a life-extending treatment at the end of life based on the evidence currently available.\n\n【26】 ## The most likely cost-effectiveness estimates are higher than those normally considered an acceptable use of NHS resources\nThe committee considered the deterministic incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for fedratinib compared with best available therapy. Because of a confidential commercial arrangement for ruxolitinib, the exact cost-effectiveness results cannot be reported here. The committee noted that the 2 main drivers of the cost-effectiveness results were whether or not fedratinib was assumed to extend overall survival  and what proportion of people would continue having fedratinib after their disease stops responding . In the company's base case, fedratinib was assumed to extend overall survival by 6.2 months, and 65% of people whose disease initially responded to fedratinib continued having it. The ERG presented 2 base cases in which it assumed that fedratinib had no overall survival benefit compared with best available therapy and 89% of all people starting fedratinib continue having fedratinib after their disease stops responding. Ruxolitinib wastage was included in ERG base case 1, and excluded in ERG base case 2. The ERG base cases also included several other of the ERG's preferred assumptions, that is:\nexcluding gender from the utility regression model using the same dose intensity for all people having fedratinib (suboptimal or not)\nbasing the fedratinib adverse event rates in the model on the intention-to-treat population from JAKARTA‑2, rather than the intermediate‑2 or high‑risk subgroup.The committee considered analyses including the following assumptions:\nwith and without a survival benefit\nthe cost of ruxolitinib based on the platelet count distribution from JAKARTA‑2\nboth with and without drug wastage for ruxolitinib\n% of all people starting fedratinib would keep having it after their disease does not fully respond or stops responding\nincluding the other ERG-preferred assumptions, outlined above.The analyses accounting for a survival benefit for fedratinib resulted in ICERs less than £30,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained, but the analyses without a survival benefit resulted in ICERs greater than this. The committee considered that the most plausible ICER was likely to be between the scenarios with and without a survival benefit for fedratinib applied. However, this ICER would likely be above £30,000 per QALY gained, the upper end of the range normally considered a cost-effective use of NHS resources when the end of life criteria are not met. The committee concluded that fedratinib could not be recommended for routine use in the NHS.\n\n【27】 #Other factors\nThe company considered fedratinib to be an innovative treatment but did not provide evidence of significant and substantial health-related benefits that were not included in the QALY calculations. The committee concluded that there were no additional gains in health-related quality of life associated with fedratinib over those already included in the QALY calculations.\nAn equalities issue was raised that myelofibrosis often affects older people. However, issues related to differences in prevalence or incidence of a disease cannot be addressed in a technology appraisal.\n\n【28】 ## Fedratinib is recommended in the Cancer Drugs Fund\nHaving concluded that fedratinib could not be recommended for routine use, the committee then considered if it could be recommended within the Cancer Drugs Fund. The committee discussed the arrangements for the Cancer Drugs Fund agreed by NICE and NHS England in 2016, noting NICE's Cancer Drugs Fund methods guide (addendum). The committee considered whether the remaining uncertainties in the company's modelling could be addressed through collecting more data. It was aware that FREEDOM‑2, a randomised controlled trial directly comparing fedratinib with best available therapy in people with myelofibrosis previously treated with ruxolitinib, is currently ongoing. The company expressed an interest in fedratinib being considered for funding through the Cancer Drugs Fund. The committee considered that FREEDOM‑2 would likely resolve some of the modelling uncertainties. These included the extent of a fedratinib survival benefit compared with best available therapy and the ruxolitinib treatment costs (how many people have the lower dose of ruxolitinib in the setting of best available therapy). Using fedratinib in the NHS would also allow data to be collected using the Systemic Anti-Cancer (SACT) dataset. This would provide data on overall survival and treatment duration for people having fedratinib in clinical practice. The committee recalled that fedratinib had shown plausible potential to be cost effective when assuming the size of survival benefit from the company's base case . The committee concluded that fedratinib met the criteria for inclusion in the Cancer Drugs Fund for treating disease-related splenomegaly or symptoms of primary myelofibrosis, post-polycythaemia vera myelofibrosis or post-essential thrombocythaemia myelofibrosis in adults who have previously had ruxolitinib.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

The school focuses on experiential learning as a learning method.\nIt was started in 1989 as \"The Denver School\" by Patricia McKinnell, one of the school's teachers and its current Dean of Students. Originally it was located in a garage. Since 1999 Logan has been located on Lowry Air Force Base, where it is one of several independent schools on a 1,866-acre former military site that is being redeveloped as a mixed-use urban community.\nAndrew Slater, the head of school, was the recipient of an NAIS/E.E. Ford Fellowship for Aspiring School Heads, a one-year long program of leadership development for \"emerging independent school leaders\" supported by the National Association of Independent Schools and the Edward E. Ford Foundation.\n\n【1】 #Curriculum\nLogan's curriculum is designed for intellectually gifted students ages four to fourteen. Students are selected for admission based on test scores, a student visit, and teacher recommendations. Each student has an individualized curriculum based on their abilities, learning style, and personal interests.  At the beginning of each school year, students each choose a unit to study (some older students choose more than one), with students encouraged to pick a unit subject that interests them, as they will spend a large portion of their time at school studying their units. The curriculum of units is designed to help teach reading, writing, math, science and other subjects, by helping students build connections between these subjects and their interests. Field trips are an important part of the program, often with an environmental emphasis.\nLogan School has 12 core classrooms including students of varying ages, usually within 2 years of each other. Children typically spend 2 years with one teacher, Logan students call their teachers by their first names.\nDuring the 1998-1999 school year, students in one class at Logan participated in a research project investigating the usability of perspectives-based software collaborative learning, as part of their studies of acid mine drainage from old gold mines in Colorado.\n\n【2】 #Recognition\nSome Logan students received an award from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) for their work.\n\n【3】 #Capital campaign and construction program\nDuring the school year of 2005-2006, The Logan School for Creative Learning conducted The Logan Legacy Campaign, a fundraiser that raised over $5 million to fund the school's expansion. The project was spearheaded by Head of School Andrew Slater.\nBefore the construction, the school only used half of the main building, leaving the rest unfinished. This area was called the Unoccupied Space. After the expansion, the Unoccupied Space was renovated and classrooms were put into the entire school, which now resembles a square horseshoe on the first level and a square on the second. Behind the West side of the school is a large berm and beyond that is a wetlands area. This is a favored place to conduct environmental studies and to enjoy nature.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

The evidence on efficacy is inconsistent and of poor quality. Therefore, this procedure should only be used with special arrangements for clinical governance, consent and audit or research.\nClinicians wishing to do percutaneous electrothermal treatment of the intervertebral disc annulus for low back pain and sciatica should:\nInform the clinical governance leads in their NHS trusts.\nEnsure that patients understand the uncertainty about the procedure's efficacy and provide them with clear written information. In particular, patients should be informed about other treatment options, about the possibility that the procedure may not relieve their symptoms, and about the risk of a flare‑up of their pain following treatment. In addition, the use of NICE's information for the public is recommended.\nAudit and review clinical outcomes of all patients having percutaneous intradiscal radiofrequency treatment of the intervertebral disc annulus .\nNICE encourages further research into percutaneous electrothermal treatment of the intervertebral disc annulus. Outcome measures should include pain relief and quality of life\nThis replaces previous guidance on percutaneous intradiscal electrothermal therapy for low back pain (NICE interventional procedure guidance 319)\n\n【2】 #Indications and current treatments\nLumbar disc herniation occurs when the nucleus pulposus of an intervertebral disc protrudes through a tear in the surrounding annulus fibrosus. Symptoms include pain in the back, pain in the leg (sciatica), and numbness or weakness in the leg. Serious neurological sequelae may sometimes occur.\nConservative treatments include analgesics, non‑steroidal anti‑inflammatory medication, manual therapy and acupuncture. Epidural corticosteroid injections can also be used to reduce nerve pain in the short term. Lumbar discectomy is considered if there is evidence of severe nerve compression or persistent symptoms that are unresponsive to conservative treatment. Surgical techniques include open discectomy or less invasive alternatives using percutaneous approaches\n\n【3】 #The procedure\nPercutaneous electrothermal treatment aims to relieve back pain and sciatica by applying thermal energy to the annulus of a damaged intervertebral disc in order to stiffen the annulus and disrupt nerve endings within it. Thermal treatment of the annulus can be performed using a variety of techniques which use radiofrequency energy. These include Intradiscal Electrothermal Therapy (IDET), biacuplasty, and Percutaneous Intradiscal Radiofrequency Thermocoagulation (PIRFT). PIRFT can be used to treat the intervertebral disc annulus and/or the disc nucleus. This guidance considers only thermal treatment of the annulus.\n\n【4】 In a systematic review of 17 studies that included patients treated by Intradiscal Electrothermal Therapy (IDET), 13 studies (503 patients) reported visual analogue scale scores for pain (scores ranged from 0 to 10 with lower scores indicating less pain). Meta‑analysis revealed that visual analogue scale scores for pain improved by a mean of 2.9 points (95% confidence interval  2.5 to 3.4; no p value reported). Meta‑analysis of 4 studies (n=196 patients) that reported SF‑36 bodily pain scores (scores ranged from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating less pain) showed that scores improved by a mean of 21.1 points (95% CI 13.4 to 28.8; no p value reported).\nIn a randomised controlled trial of 59 patients treated by intradiscal biacuplasty (n=29) or sham (n=30), mean numerical rating scale scores for pain (scores ranged from 0 to 10 with lower scores indicating less pain) improved from 7.13 to 4.94 and from 7.18 to 6.58 respectively, at 6‑month follow‑up (p value between groups=0.014).\nSpecialist advisers listed key efficacy outcomes as visual analogue scale scores for pain, validated back pain and disability scores, functional outcome scores and measures of social function (for example, productivity at home and the ability to work)\n\n【5】 #Safety\nCatheter breakage was reported in 19 patients (involving 20 tips which fractured and separated) in a case series of 1675 patients treated by Intradiscal Electrothermal Therapy (IDET). Two broken tips were retrieved using percutaneous methods, 1 was removed surgically, 16 were left in the disc and 1 was left in subcutaneous tissues. None of the cases were associated with any morbidity. A case report of 1 patient treated by IDET described paraesthesia and dysaethesia in the left leg, 6 months after a procedure in which 3 different catheters had to be used because of catheter breakage. On the third attempt, the tip of the catheter broke off inside the disc space and was not retrieved. When the patient reported dysaesthetic symptoms, the tip was surgically removed and the patient reported no symptoms 3 months after removal.\nTransient radiculopathy, which lasted for less than 6 weeks, was reported in 11% (4/38) of patients in the IDET group and 5% (1/19) of patients in the sham procedure group in a randomised controlled trial of 57 patients.\nBladder dysfunction was reported in 1 patient in the case series of 1675 patients treated by IDET. During IDET the treating physician noted that the catheter was positioned in the extra‑discal space\nType 1 complex regional pain syndrome was reported at 3‑month follow‑up in a case report of 1 patient treated by Percutaneous Intradiscal Radiofrequency Thermocoagulation (PIRFT) of the annulus. The patient reported that their back pain decreased after receiving PIRFT but both feet became extremely painful and swollen. The patient was treated by medical therapy and a computer tomography‑guided lumbar sympathetic trunk block.\nIncreased axial back pain was reported in a case report of 1 patient treated by IDET. Magnetic resonance imaging at 3‑month follow‑up revealed diffuse 'marrow oedema' of the L2 vertebral body consistent with osteonecrosis; this resolved at 12‑month follow‑up.\nIn a systematic review of 17 studies that included patients treated by IDET, 11 studies (486 patients) reported the incidence of adverse events. Meta‑analysis revealed an adverse event rate of 0.8% (95% confidence interval 0.2% to 1.4%).

{"seq_id": "5bce46fb-ff5a-4dfe-b4b8-56797e311550", "title": null, "text": "【0】 Periorbital cellulitis\nSynonyms and keywords: Preseptal cellulitis\n\n【1】 #Overview\nPeriorbital cellulitis is an inflammation and infection of the eyelid and area around the eye. Periorbital cellulitis is also called preseptal cellulitis because it affects the structures in front of the septum, such as the eyelid and skin around the eye. Periorbital cellulitis often occurs from a scratch or insect bite around the eye that leads to infection of the skin. Symptoms can include swelling, redness, pain, and tenderness to touch occurring around one eye only. The affected person is able to move the eye in all directions without pain, but there can be difficulty opening the eyelid, often due to swelling. Also vision is normal.\n\n【2】 #Historical Perspective\n- Donahue and Schwartz have described 70 cases of periorbital cellulitis from 1986 to 1996 at their institution.\n\n【3】 #Classification\n- Periorbital cellulitis must be differentiated from orbital cellulitis, which is an infection involving the soft tissues posterior to the orbital septum, including the fat and muscle within the bony orbit ant it is an emergency and sight-threatening situation. In contrast to orbital cellulitis, patients with periorbital cellulitis do not have bulging of the eye (proptosis), limited eye movement (ophthalmoplegia), pain on eye movement, and loss of vision. If any of these features is present, one must assume that the patient has orbital cellulitis and begin treatment with IV antibiotics. CT scan may be done to delineate the extension of the infection.\n- A common cause of preseptal cellulitis is extension of infection from the paranasal sinuses, sinusitis. Other causes include trauma, foreign bodies, insect bites, skin infections (impetigo), eyelid lesions (chalazia, hordeola), and iatrogenic causes such as eyelid and oral procedures.\n\n【4】 #Pathophysiology\n- The most common inciting events of periorbital cellulitis include sinusitis specially ethmoiditis, hematogenous seeding, insect bites, periocular or facial trauma, and impetigo. Pathogens spread to nearby tissues through the ophthalmic venous system or the lamina papyracea.\n- In a retrospective review of 104 patients with periorbital cellulitis over a 15-year period, the most common predisposing etiologies were acute dacryocystitis (32.6%), sinusitis and upper respiratory infection (28.8%), and recent trauma or surgery (27.8%).\n\n【5】 #Causes\n- The most common bacterial germs causing periorbital cellulitis are Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes. With increased vaccination, there are fewer cases of Haemophilus influenzae as a causative organism. Less common causes are Acinetobacter, Nocardia, Pseudomonas, Neisseria, Mycobacterium and fungal infections.\n\n【6】 #Differentiating periorbital cellulitis from other Diseases\n- It is important to differentiate periorbital cellulitis from orbital cellulitis, allergic reactions, orbital tumors, exophthalmos, chalazion and hordeolum.\n- In neonatal patients gonorrhoea and Chlamydia infection should be considered.\n\n【7】 #Epidemiology and Demographics\n- Periorbital cellulitis can occur at any age, but it is common in children and it is more common than orbital cellulitis in this population.\n\n【8】 #Risk Factors\n- The risk factors include trauma, insect bite, localized or systemic infection and postsurgical.\n\n【9】 #Screening\n- There is insufficient evidence to recommend routine screening for periorbital cellulitis.\n\n【10】 ## Diagnostic Study of Choice\n- The diagnosis of periorbital cellulitis is mainly a clinical diagnosis with radiologic findings.\n\n【11】 ## History and Symptoms\n- Clinical assessment should evaluate a patient’s general appearance and local conditions to differentiate periorbital cellulitis with orbital cellulitis. A meticulous examination based on the recognition of distinctive signs, relevant history and an evaluation of predisposing risk factors is essential in diagnosis and expeditious treatment.\n- Assessment of visual acuity, pupillary response, examination of the ocular adnexa and globe are paramount.\n\n【12】 ## Physical Examination\n- Physical examination, including an assessment of routine vital signs, visual acuity and eye movement. Local examination generally reveals associated symptoms like eyelid and periorbital swelling, tenderness, erythema, warmth, proptosis, ophthalmoplegia, and impaired vision.\n\n【13】 ## Laboratory Findings\n- Blood cultures are not performed routinely. They are difficult to obtain in those with periorbital cellulitis and are usually negative. However, laboratory tests, including assessment of white blood cell counts and serum C-reactive protein levels may be useful in children with fever.\n\n【14】 ## X-ray\n- There are no x-ray findings associated with periorbital cellulitis.\n\n【15】 ## CT scan\n- A CT scan of the orbits and sinuses allows differentiation of the periorbital cellulitis and orbital cellulitis , as well as a way to determine the extent of the infection. The CT scan of periorbital cellulitis shows eyelid swelling, no proptosis, no fat stranding of orbital contents, and no involvement of the extraocular muscles.\n- In cases where abscesses are suspected, a brain CT is required to rule out intracranial involvement. A CT scan is also recommended if marked eyelid swelling, fever, leukocytosis, or no improvement after 24 hours of the proper antibiotics.\n\n【16】 ## MRI\n- MRI does not have indication in periorbital cellulitis\n\n【17】 ## Other Imaging Findings\n- There are no other imaging findings associated with periorbital cellulitis.\n\n【18】 ## Other Diagnostic Studies\n\n【19】 #Treatment\n- The treatment of periorbital cellulitis differs based on the severity of disease and age of the patient. The mainstay of treatment is usually antibiotic coverage against staphylococcus aureus, the streptococcus species, and anaerobes. Patients who are over one year of age with mild symptoms can be treated as an outpatient with oral antibiotics. However, if the patient does not respond to oral antibiotics in 48 hours or if extension of the infectious process into the orbit is suspected, he or she should be admitted to the hospital and a CT scan must be performed to evaluate for orbital extension, and intravenous antibiotics must be indicated. Those with more severe disease or are less than one year of age, should be admitted to the hospital.\n- Usually children under 2 years of age or febrile patients with a severe cellulitis are managed with intravenous antibiotics during hospitalization, with close followup. Hospitalization is also recommended in patients who cannot be followed up as outpatients. Intravenous antibiotics are usually indicated for two or three days, depending on improvement. If the condition improves, treatment can be switched to the appropriate oral antibiotics based on cultures.\n\n【20】 ## Medical Therapy\n- Periocular infection\n- 1. Causative pathogens\n- Streptococcus spp.\n- Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA)\n- Hemophilus influenzae\n- 2. Empiric antimicrobial therapy\n- Preferred regimen : Clindamycin 300-450 mg PO q6h for 1-2 weeks or Clindamycin 600-900 mg IV q8h for 1-2 weeks\n- Alternative regimen : Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole 160 mg PO q12h for 1-2 weeks or  Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole 2.5 mgkg IV q12h for 1-2 weeks\n- Alternative regimen : Doxycycline 100 mg IV or PO q12h for 1-2 weeks\n- 3. Pathogen-directed antimicrobial therapy\n- 3.2 Non-MRSA organisms\n\n【21】 ## Surgery\n- If medical therapy fails to show improvement after 24 to 48 hours, patients should be hospitalized and a surgical consultation should be considered for possible incision and drainage. Surgical drainage and debridement of a lid abscess can be performed by a small incision through the skin over an area of fluctuance.\n\n【22】 ## Primary Prevention\n- There are no established measures for the primary prevention of periorbital cellulitis.\n\n【23】 ## Secondary Prevention\n- There are no established measures for the secondary prevention of periorbital cellulitis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Ethylene is a small hydrocarbon, gaseous at room temperature, readily inflammable but toxic only in concentration. Derived from petrochemical fractionation or vegitative fermentation, it has a number of industrial uses and is a critical feedstock for plastics manufacture.\nDiethyl glycol dinitrate is a colorless, oderless, viscous, oily liquid, specific gravity (s.g.) 1.4092 at 0oC and 1.3846 at 20oC; freezing point -11.5oC under a standard atmosphere, the theoretical boiling point of approximately 197oC difficult to confirm as the compound begins to decompose and spontaneously inflames at or slightly below this temperature.\nMixed with nitrocellulose and extruded under pressure, diethyl glycol dinitrate forms a tough colloid whose characteristics (good specific impulse, moderate burn rate and temperature, great resistance to accidental ignition and casual handling) make it well suited as a solid propellant for rocketry. It was widely used in this capacity, by both sides, during World War 2. It also found use as a \"productive\" desensitizer (one that contributes to the overall power of the explosion rather than having a neutral or negative effect) in nitroglycerine and nitroglycol based explosives (such as dynamite and blasting gelatin).\nIf ingested, it, like nitroglycerine, produces rapid vasodialation through the release of nitrogen monoxide, NO, a physiological signaling molecule that acts to relax smooth muscle. As such it has occasionally been used medically to relieve angina, substernal chest pain associated with impaired cardiac circulation, since the concurrent headache it induces is somewhat less severe than other nitro compounds.\nThe medical application was never widespread, the standard nitroglycerine being faster acting and almost literally dirt cheap; oral nitrates in any case being only palliative, not an effective treatment.\nH.

Thopaz+ can reduce drainage time and length of stay in hospital, and improves safety for people with chest drains. Its use may also improve clinical decision-making through continuous, objective monitoring of air leaks and fluid loss.\nCost modelling indicates that Thopaz+ is cost saving compared with conventional chest drains in people after pulmonary resection. The estimated saving is £108 per patient per hospital stay, with savings mainly achieved through reduced length of stay . The resource impact assessment for this guidance shows that, at a national level, adopting Thopaz+ is expected to save around £8.5 million per year in England\n\n【3】 #The technology\n\n【4】 #Description of the technology\nThopaz+ (Medela UK) is a portable digital chest drain system that provides regulated negative pressure close to the patient's chest and continuously monitors and records air leak and fluid drainage. The system comprises an in-built, regulated suction pump with a digital display, rechargeable battery, tubing that connects to any standard chest drain catheter and a Thopaz+ disposable fluid collection canister. Sensors in the system turn the pump on and off to ensure the pressure level set by the healthcare professional is precisely maintained.\nThe rental cost of each Thopaz+ unit, as stated in the company's submission, is £115 per month. It can also be purchased for £3,570 .\nThe claimed benefits of Thopaz+ in the case for adoption presented by the company are:\nreduced chest tube duration shorter length of hospital stay higher patient satisfaction increased convenience for doctors and nursing staff improved chest drain management better prediction of patient outcomes less plastic consumable waste.\n\n【5】 #Current management\nConventional chest drains use an underwater seal to help drain air and fluid from the pleural space, allowing the lung to re-inflate. This can be done with or without additional wall suction. NICE's guideline on major trauma recommends chest drains for managing chest trauma in pre-hospital and hospital settings, but chest drain management is not specifically covered by NICE guidance.\nThe British Thoracic Society guidelines on pleural disease state that chest drains should include a valve mechanism to prevent fluid or air entering the pleural cavity. This may be an underwater seal, flutter valve or other recognised mechanism. Chest drains with underwater seals appear to be standard care in the NHS and consist of a water seal, optional suction control and drainage collection bottle. These drains collect fluid and prevent backflow into the pleural cavity, while at the same time allowing a subjective assessment of air leaks and fluid loss. The drainage bottle must be placed below chest level and kept upright. Suction may sometimes be needed, depending on the patient's condition, and can usually be provided using a wall suction unit\n\n【6】 #Clinical evidence\n\n【7】 #Summary of clinical evidence\nThe evidence for Thopaz+ assessed by the external assessment centre  was in the UK: the 12 other studies were done in Europe, Asia and North America\n\n【8】 #Main points from the EAC's analysis of the clinical evidence\nThe EAC considered that of the 6 randomised controlled trials:\nPompili et al.  was well designed and reported, and of excellent quality were of good quality with clear protocols and results\nMier et al.  was of lower quality with no clear hypothesis but had well-matched comparative groups of patients.The EAC also noted that 3 observational comparative studies  were of high quality using propensity-matched control cohorts.\nThe EAC considered that all of the sites in the studies were likely to have different local protocols for inserting and removing chest drains, which may make the results more reflective of the likely variation in chest tube drainage protocols across the NHS.\nAll but 1 of the comparative studies  were on the use of Thopaz+ after pulmonary resection. All of the comparators were conventional analogue drainage units using wall suction. The results showed that Thopaz+ was associated with shorter drainage times (7 of 8 studies) and a shorter length of stay (4 of 6 studies) compared with conventional chest drainage.\nTwo studies that included patients with pneumothorax . Results from the comparative study showed that both drainage time and length of hospital stay are statistically significantly shorter with Thopaz+.\nChest drains needed to be reinserted in 4 of the comparative trials. Rates of reinsertion were lower for Thopaz+ than for conventional chest drainage, but the difference was not statistically significant.\nThe EAC found no published quantitative, comparative evidence for staff time spent on chest drainage when using Thopaz+ or for fluid loss measurement.\n\n【9】 #Summary of economic evidence\nThe company's economic submission was a simple decision tree with 1 decision node for the use of Thopaz+ or conventional chest drainage with wall suction, based on inputs from Pompili et al, The time horizon was the length of hospital stay\n\n【10】 #EAC's analysis of the economic evidence\nThe EAC agreed that the company's simple model structure was appropriate, but it made some changes to better reflect the evidence and current NHS practice. These changes comprised:\nadding costs for consumables and training associated with standard drainage using a length of hospital stay of 5.4 days for Thopaz+ (based on a weighted average from 6 studies) and 5.8 days for conventional chest drainage (based on 3 studies)\nusing a drainage time of 3.5 days for Thopaz+ (based on 8 studies)\nadding the cost of chest drain reinsertion and complications (reinsertion prevalence was calculated as 0.017 from 4 studies)\nrevising the consumer and training costs for Thopaz+4 of the assessment report.\nThe company's base case resulted in a cost saving per patient of £35.56 for Thopaz+ compared with conventional chest drainage over the length of hospital stay. After the EAC's changes, this cost saving increased to £107.99 per patient .\n\n【11】 #Clinical effectiveness\nThe committee noted that the evidence presented for Thopaz+ was mainly for its use in patients after pulmonary resection. The clinical experts confirmed that this reflected their experience in the NHS. The committee considered that Thopaz+ has clear clinical advantages compared with conventional chest drainage using wall suction in patients after pulmonary resection, including a shorter drainage time and a shorter length of stay in hospital.\n\n【12】 #NHS and system impact considerations\nThe clinical experts explained that using Thopaz+ allows treatment across wards to be standardised, because it provides objective measurements of air leakage and fluid loss. These data make it easier to assess and record patients' progress. This, in turn, may help clinicians determine when is best to remove the chest drain. One clinical expert explained how the use of Thopaz+ had helped them redesign the logging system for chest drain management.\nThe committee heard that managing chest drains with Thopaz+ is easier than with conventional chest drainage and this may release nurse time. Patients may also need fewer chest X-rays with the use of Thopaz+.\n\n【13】 #Cost savings\nThe committee noted that the estimated cost savings with Thopaz+ of £107.99 per patient in people after pulmonary resection was largely attributable to a reduced length in hospital of up to 1.5 days (average 0.4 days) per patient compared with conventional chest drainage . The committee considered the implications of this reduced length of stay and whether it was realisable in practice. The clinical experts explained that the continuous, objective monitoring possible with Thopaz+ helps reliable decision-making and encourages earlier chest drain removal and discharge. The committee noted that Thopaz+ remained cost saving even with a difference in length of stay of only 0.071 days.\nThe committee concluded that using Thopaz+ is likely to lead to significant clinical and system benefits compared with conventional chest drainage in people who need chest drainage after pulmonary resection or pneumothorax.\nFor the guidance review, the EAC revised the model to reflect 2021 costs (original guidance values given in brackets). The main parameter change was the cost of Thopaz+ at £3,570 (£3,400). Other parameter changes were associated with staff costs, bed days and complications", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

As a function of frequency \\nu, Planck's law is written as:\nThis function represents the emitted power per unit area of emitting surface, per unit solid angle, and per unit frequency. Sometimes, Planck's law is written as an expression u(\\nu,T) = \\pi I(\\nu,T) for emitted power integrated over all solid angles. In other cases, it is written as u(\\nu,T) = 4\\pi I(\\nu,T)/c for energy per unit volume.\nThe function I(\\nu,T) peaks for h\\nu = 2.82kT.  It falls off exponentially at higher frequencies and polynomially at lower.\nAs a function of wavelength λ, Planck's law written (for unit solid angle) as:\nThis function peaks for hc = 4.97λkT, a factor of 1.76 shorter in wavelength (higher in frequency) than the frequency peak.  It is the more commonly used peak in Wien's displacement law.\nThe radiance emitted over a frequency range  or a wavelength range  =  can be obtained by integrating the respective functions.\n\n【1】 #Overview\nThe wavelength is related to the frequency by:\nThe law is sometimes written in terms of the spectral energy density which has units of energy per unit volume per unit frequency (joule per cubic meter per hertz). Integrated over frequency, this expression yields the total energy density. The radiation field of a black body may be thought of as a photon gas, in which case this energy density would be one of the thermodynamic parameters of that gas.\nas shown in the derivation below.\nMax Planck originally produced this law in 1900 (published in 1901) in an attempt to improve upon the Wien approximation, published in 1896 by Wilhelm Wien, which fit the experimental data at short wavelengths (high frequencies) but deviated from it at long wavelengths (low frequencies). The Rayleigh-Jeans law (first published in incomplete form by Rayleigh in 1900) fit well in the complementary domain (long wavelength, low frequency).  Planck found that the above function, Planck's function, fitted the data for all wavelengths remarkably well.\nIn constructing a derivation of this law, he considered the possible ways of distributing electromagnetic energy over the different modes of charged oscillators in matter. Planck's law emerged when he assumed that the energy of these oscillators was limited to a set of discrete, integer multiples of a fundamental unit of energy, E, proportional to the oscillation frequency ν:\nPlanck made this quantization assumption five years before Albert Einstein hypothesized the existence of photons as a means of explaining the photoelectric effect.  At the time, Planck believed that the quantization applied only to the tiny oscillators that were thought to exist in the walls of the cavity (what we now know to be atoms), and made no assumption that light itself propagates in discrete bundles or packets of energy.  Moreover, Planck did not attribute any physical significance to this assumption, but rather believed that it was merely a mathematical device that enabled him to derive a single expression for the black body spectrum that matched the empirical data at all wavelengths.\nAlthough Planck's formula predicts that a black body will radiate energy at all frequencies, the formula is only practically applicable when many photons are being measured. For example, a black body at room temperature (300 kelvin) with one square meter of surface area  will emit a photon in the visible range once about every thousand years or so, meaning that for most practical purposes, a black body at room temperature does not emit in the visible range. Significance of this fact for the derivation of Planck's law from experimental data, and for the substantiation of the law by the data, is discussed in\nUltimately, Planck's assumption of energy quantization and Einstein's photon hypothesis became the fundamental basis for the development of quantum mechanics.\n\n【2】 #Derivation\nThe following derivation of Planck's law can be found, e.g. in .  also the gas in a box article for a general derivation.\nConsider a cube of side L with conducting walls filled with electromagnetic radiation.\nAt the walls of the cube, the parallel component of the electric field and the orthogonal component of the magnetic field must vanish. Analogous to the wave function of a particle in a box, one finds that the fields are superpositions of periodic functions. The three wavelengths \\lambda_{1}, \\lambda_{2} and \\lambda_{3}, in the three directions  orthogonal to the walls can be:\nwhere the n_{i} are integers. For each set of integers n_{i} there are two linear independent solutions (modes). According to quantum theory, the energy levels of a mode are given by:\nThe quantum number r can be interpreted as the number of photons in the mode. The two modes for each set of n_{i} correspond to the two polarization states of the photon which has a spin of 1. Note that for r=0 the energy of the mode is not zero. This vacuum energy of the electromagnetic field is responsible for the Casimir effect. In the following we will calculate the internal energy of the box at temperature T relative to the vacuum energy.\nAccording to statistical mechanics, the probability distribution over the energy levels of a particular mode is given by:\nHere\nThe denominator Z(\\beta), is the partition function of a single mode and makes P_{r} properly normalized:\nwhich is the energy of a single photon. As explained here, the average energy in a mode can be expressed in terms of the partition function:\nThis formula is a special case of the general formula for particles obeying Bose-Einstein statistics. Since there is no restriction on the total number of photons, the chemical potential is zero.\nTo calculate the density of states we rewrite equation  as follows:\nwhere n is the norm of the vector \\vec{n}=\\left(n_{1},n_{2},n_{3}\\right):\nFor every vector n with integer components larger than or equal to zero there are two photon states. This means that the number of photon states in a certain region of n-space is twice the volume of that region. An energy range of d\\varepsilon corresponds to shell of thickness dn= (2L/hc) d\\varepsilon in n-space. Because the components of \\vec{n} have to be positive, this shell spans an octant of a sphere. The number of photon states g(\\varepsilon)\\,d\\varepsilon in an energy range d\\varepsilon is thus given by:\nInserting this in Eq.  gives:\nFrom this equation one easily derives the spectral energy density as a function of frequency u(\\nu,T) and as a function of wavelength u(\\lambda,T):\nwhere:\nu(\\nu,T) is known as the black body spectrum.  It is a spectral energy density function with units of energy per unit frequency per unit volume.\nAnd:\nin Eq. makes the integration variable dimensionless giving:\nwhere J is given by:\n\n【3】 The total electromagnetic energy inside the box is thus given by:\nwhere V=L^3 is the volume of the box. (Note - This is not the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which is the total energy radiated by a black body.  that article for an explanation.) Since the radiation is the same in all directions, and propagates at the speed of light (c), the spectral radiance (energy/time/area/solid angle/frequency) is which yields\nIt can be converted to an expression for I'(\\lambda,T) in wavelength units by substituting \\nu by c/\\lambda and evaluating\n\n【4】 #Percentiles\nThe shape of Planck's law is independent of temperature.  It is therefore possible to list the percentile points of the total radiation as well as the peaks for wavelength and frequency, in a form which gives the wavelength \\lambda when divided by temperature T\nThe wavelength and frequency peaks are in bold and occur at 25.0% and 64.6% respectively.  The 41.8% point is the wavelength-frequency-neutral peak.  These are the points at which the quotients by e^{h\\nu/kT}-1 of the respective Planck-law functions 1/\\lambda^5, \\nu^3, and (\\nu/\\lambda)^2 attain their maxima.\nWhich peak to use depends on the application.  The conventional choice is the wavelength peak at 25.0% given by Wien's displacement law.  For some purposes the median or 50% point dividing the total radiation into two halves may be more suitable.  The latter is closer to the frequency peak than to the wavelength peak because the radiance drops exponentially at short wavelengths and only polynomially at long.  The neutral peak occurs at a shorter wavelength than the median for the same reason.\nFor the Sun, T = 5778 K, allowing the percentile points of the Sun's radiation from 10% to 90%, in nanometers, to be tabulated as follows when modeled as a black body radiator, to which the Sun is a fair approximation.\nThis is the radiation arriving at the top of the atmosphere.  Radiation below 400 nm, or ultraviolet, is about 12%, while that above 700 nm, or infrared, starts at about the 49% point and so accounts for 51% of the total. The atmosphere shifts these percentages substantially in favor of visible light as it absorbs most of the ultraviolet and significant amounts of infrared.\n\n【5】 #History\nMany popular science accounts of quantum theory, as well as some physics textbooks, contain some serious errors in their discussions of the history of Planck's Law.  Although these errors were pointed out over forty years ago by historians of physics, they have proved to be difficult to eradicate. An article by Helge Kragh gives a lucid account of what actually happened.\nHe also plainly explains in his book \"Theory of Heat Radiation\" that his constant refers to Hertzian oscillators.  The idea of quantization was developed by others into what we now know as quantum mechanics. The next step along this direction was made by Albert Einstein, who, by studying the photoelectric effect, proposed a model and equation whereby light was not only emitted but also absorbed in packets or photons. Then, in 1924, Satyendra Nath Bose developed the theory of the statistical mechanics of photons, which allowed a theoretical derivation of Planck's law.\nContrary to another myth, Planck did not derive his law in an attempt to resolve the \"ultraviolet catastrophe\", the name given by Paul Ehrenfest to the paradoxical result that the total energy in the cavity tends to infinity when the equipartition theorem of classical statistical mechanics is applied to black body radiation. Planck did not consider the equipartition theorem to be universally valid, so he never noticed any sort of \"catastrophe\" — it was only discovered some five years later by Einstein, Lord Rayleigh, and Sir James Jeans.\n\n【6】 A simple way to calculate the integral is to calculate the general case first and then compute the answer at the end. Consider the integral\nSince the denominator is always less than one, we can expand it in powers of e^{-x} to get a convergent series\nHere we have used the formula for the sum of a geometric series.  The fraction on the left is the expression for the series indicated by the summation:  1 + e^{-x} + e^{-2x} + e^{-3x} + \\cdots.  The common multiplier is e^{-x}.\nThen we have\nMultiplication by the e^{-x} on the left shifts our summation series one position to the right.  That is, 1 + e^{-x} + e^{-2x} + \\cdots becomes e^{-x} + e^{-2x} + e^{-3x} + \\cdots.  Therefore, we bump the index up by one and drop the e^{-x}:\nBy changing variables such that u = kx, thereby making x^n = \\frac{u^n}{k^n} and dx = \\frac{du}{k}, we have\n-r,\nThe summation on the left is the Riemann zeta function \\zeta(n+1), while the integral on the right is the Gamma function  \\Gamma(n+1) , and we are finally left with the general result\n-r equivalently\nFor our problem, the numerator contains x^3, leaving us with our specific result\nHere we have used the fact that is the Riemann zeta function evaluated for the argument 4, which is given by \\pi^{4}/90. \" at Wallis product for a simple though lengthy derivation of \\zeta.  This fact can also be proven by considering the following contour integral.\nWhere C_{R} is a contour of radius R around the origin. In the limit, as R approaches infinity, the integral approaches zero. Using the residue theorem the integral can also be written as a sum of residues at the poles of the integrand. The poles are at zero, the positive and negative integers. The sum of the residues yields precisely twice the desired summation plus the residue at zero. Because the integral approaches zero, the sum of all the residues must be zero. The summation must therefore equal minus one half times the residue at zero. From the series expansion of the cotangent function\ncot(x)=\\frac{1}{x} - \\frac {x}{3} - \\frac {x^3} {45} +\\ldots, we see that the residue at zero is -\\pi^{4}/45 which yields the desired result.

A 1984 World Health Organization report into the syndrome suggested up to 30% of new and remodelled buildings worldwide may be linked to symptoms of SBS. Sick building causes are frequently pinned down to flaws in the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, and are often 'cured' by boosting the overall turn-over rate in fresh air exchange with the outside air. Other causes have been attributed to contaminants produced by out-gassing of some types of building materials, or improper exhaust ventilation of light industrial chemicals used within.\n\n【1】 #Symptoms of SBS\nBuilding occupants complain of symptoms such as:\n- Headache\n- Eye, nose, or throat irritation\n- Dry cough; dry or itchy skin\n- Dizziness and nausea - Difficulty in concentrating\n- Fatigue\n- Sensitivity to odours\n- Increased incidence of asthma attacks/appearance of asthma in non-asthmatics\n- Personality changes such as rage/weeping/paranoia/depression\n- Putative cases of bronchitis or pneumonia which do not respond to antibiotic treatment\n- Symptoms resembling Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)\nThis is a shortened list, as over 50 possible symptoms are known. It is possible for a dozen sick occupants to report a surprising array of individual symptoms which may be dismissed as unconnected. The key to discovery is the increased incidence of illnesses in general with onset or exacerbation within a fairly close time frame - usually within a period of weeks. Some sources will insist that for SBS to exist, these symptoms must disappear soon after the occupants go outside. However, this view discounts the lingering effects of various neurotoxins, which may not clear up when the occupant leaves the building.

{"seq_id": "627eda68-14a4-4d22-adcf-2a6f57d6a3eb", "title": null, "text": "【0】 Recommendations were developed by the Task Group and were based on available evidence as well as collective expert opinion (where there was limited or no published evidence).- This guideline provides criteria to help determine whether or not a procedure performed by a HCW is an exposure-prone procedure. It does not provide risk categories for these procedures - This guideline provides a viral load cut-off level to inform an infected HCW's fitness for practice, thus increasing patient safety and optimizing the work force\n\n【1】 #LIST OF FIGURES\n\n【2】 #Background\nHealthcare workers (HCWs) have an ethical and professional duty to care for their patients in accordance with established standards of practice and care, acting in good faith, and not allowing their personal interests to conflict with their professional obligations. This responsibility includes minimizing the risk of patient exposure to bloodborne viruses (BBVs) while receiving care.\nThe purpose of this guideline is to provide a national framework for developing policies and procedures to prevent the transmission of bloodborne viruses (BBVs), specifically human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and hepatitis B virus (HBV) from infected HCWs to patients in the healthcare setting. Failure to adhere to infection prevention and control principles identified as Routine Practices could result in transmission of BBVs. This guideline assumes that HCWs will adhere to Routine Practices when providing care to all patients at all times and in all settings. Recommendations on these practices are provided in PHAC's guideline titled Routine Practices and Additional Precautions for Preventing the Transmission of Infection in Healthcare Settings. As long as infected HCWs adhere to these practices, the risk of transmission of BBVs from infected HCWs to patients is negligible, except during exposure-prone procedures (EPPs), which may pose an increased but minimal risk. Exposure-prone procedures are invasive procedures where there is a risk that injury to the infected HCW may result in the exposure of the patient's open tissues to the blood of the HCW and depending on the nature of that exposure and host factors (e.g. immunity) transmission of the BBV may occur.\n\n【3】 #Scope\nThis guideline is a key part of PHAC's work to provide evidence-based recommendations within the context of the Canadian healthcare system; thus providing national leadership as well as the underpinnings for organizational policy and a consistent pan-Canadian approach to the management of HCWs infected with a BBV.\nRecommendations provided in this guideline are intended to assist those involved with the assessment and management of HCWs infected with a BBV, either individually (e.g. treating physician, members of an Expert Review Panel) or generally (e.g. regulatory authorities). This guideline applies to all HCWs with specific recommendations for HCWs infected with a BBV. Implementation of these recommendations will increase patient safety while allowing HCWs infected with a BBV to continue to work safely.\n\n【4】 #Risk factors\nAlthough it is well documented that the risk of a BBV transmission from patient to HCW is significantly higher than the risk of transmission from HCW to patient, the focus of this guideline is to further reduce the minimal risk to patients and to provide guidance for the consistent management of HCWs infected with BBVs. Efforts to prevent HCW-to-patient transmission of BBVs involve understanding the factors that affect the HCWs' risk of occupational acquisition of a BBV and the subsequent risk of transmission of the BBV during an EPP.\nWith the availability of the hepatitis B vaccine, immune HCWs are protected from occupational acquisition of HBV. Therefore, ensuring HBV immunity among HCWs as early as possible and on admission into health professional training programs is paramount. Nevertheless, multiple percutaneous injuries throughout a HCW's career may place them at risk for occupational acquisition of HIV or HCV infection. Adequate training and education on the prevention and management of occupational injuries and potential exposures are fundamental to all HCWs as part of an occupational health program. In addition, ongoing awareness of their own serologic status is essential for HCWs who perform EPPs.\nIn defining the risk of transmission of a BBV from an infected HCW to a patient, it is necessary to consider both the actual risk informed by available evidence and the risk perceived by the public as these both inform what is considered acceptable risk. Patient safety studies show that the most frequent types of adverse events affecting hospitalized patients are adverse drug events, wound infections, and surgical complications. Some risks, such as those known to be associated with surgical procedures, are generally accepted by patients. Although a precise assessment of the real risk of HCW-to-patient transmission of BBVs has not been determined, factors described in reports involving potential patient exposure (with or without ensuing transmission) provided some evidence for the development of this guideline.\nWhile zero risk of transmission is unattainable, the availability of a vaccine that prevents HBV infection, effective treatment for HCV resulting in a sustained virologic response, and suppression of HIV with strict adherence to antiviral therapy, could render this risk negligible.\n\n【5】 #Methodology\nA project protocol was developed to outline the steps and methods for conducting the systematic reviews and environmental scans to inform recommendations provided in this guideline Systematic reviews were then conducted for Key Questions to inform the risk of transmission of HIV, HCV, and HBV from infected HCWs to patients. Additional systematic reviews were conducted to address Key Questions examining infectivity of each virus related to the source serum viral load at time of exposure. The literature informing the systematic reviews consisted primarily of lookback investigations and other descriptive studies. A published systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was available and therefore used, along with other studies, to inform the effectiveness of double gloving in preventing HCW-to-patient transmission of a BBV. Evidence from all eligible studies was reviewed and qualitatively synthesized. Where applicable, the body of evidence was graded using PHAC's Infection Prevention and Control Guidelines: Critical Appraisal Tool Kit.\nEnvironmental scans of relevant literature were conducted for Key Questions where the topic dealt with organizational, regulatory, and/or ethical issues not solely or directly informed by scientific research. No grade of evidence was assigned to recommendations from the environmental scans.\nSummaries of published epidemiologic investigations involving HCWs infected with a BBV globally, from the late 1980s to 2018, were tabulated and are provided in the guideline appendices.\n\n【6】 #Key stakeholder input and expert review\nThe process of developing this guideline involved consultation with relevant federal, provincial and territorial (FPT) partners and key stakeholder organizations which included clinicians with relevant expertise. A preliminary consultation with a targeted group of key stakeholders involved a needs assessment conducted prior to the development of the guideline to inform its scope and key issues. Existing guidelines developed for use in other countries and relevant provincial and territorial policies in Canada were reviewed for scope and content prior to the development of this guideline. Upon completion of a preliminary draft guideline, an extensive consultation with FPT partners and key stakeholders was done to obtain feedback. All feedback received from the consultation processes were reviewed and addressed as deemed appropriate by the Task Group prior to finalizing the guideline.\n\n【7】 #Limitations\nFor ethical and methodological reasons, RCTs are not feasible to assess potentially harmful situations such as the transmission of BBVs. Many studies informing this guideline were weak in study design, with their overall quality ranging from mostly low and medium to a few high quality studies. In some instances, comparator interventions used in the selection criteria for the systematic reviews did not allow for substantially minimizing confounding factors. Where graded, the grade of evidence ranged from CI to BII. For items where there was a paucity of published studies, inconclusive study results, or information was obtained solely from environmental scans, expert opinion of the Task Group members informed recommendations for practice.\n\n【8】 #New approach and additional content: how this guideline differs from Health Canada's 1998 consensus document\nIn the past 20 years there has been remarkable progress in the prevention, diagnosis tools, treatment regimens, and management of infections due to BBVs as well as major improvements in guideline development methodology. These advancements were considered in developing this guideline. As a result, there are key differences in the approach used for the development of this guideline and Health Canada's 1998 consensus document. Some key items include:\n- The Task Group was selected by PHAC based on identified expertise needed for the guideline topic -infectious diseases, medical microbiology and virology, infection prevention and control, public health, occupational health, hepatology, dentistry, medical ethics, and obstetrics and gynecology. The Task Group reported to PHAC's National Advisory Body on Infection Prevention and Control.\n- An evidence-based approach involving rigorous review and synthesis of the evidence with expert interpretation of the evidence was used in the development of this guideline.\n- Six systematic reviews, a narrative review, and three environmental scans of the most current and relevant literature were conducted to inform the guideline content.\n- Where possible, evidence from eligible studies in the systematic reviews was graded.\n- Key stakeholder consultation was conducted prior to writing the guideline and an extensive consultation followed the development of the first draft of the guideline.\n\n【9】 - Recommendations provided in this guideline were thought to be sufficient to prevent transmission from HCWs co-infected with two or all three of these BBVs. If a HCW who performs EPPs is co-infected, the HCW should meet the defined criteria recommended for safe practice by HCWs infected with each virus.\n\n【10】 #Recommendations for healthcare worker students and trainees\n- Professional schools should provide counselling to students and trainees infected with a BBV on potential implications of their BBV status to their future career, in order to facilitate making an informed decision regarding their preferred stream of study.\n\n【11】 #Recommendations for healthcare worker and patient exposures\n- Every organization or jurisdiction should have a mechanism for risk assessment to determine whether a patient or HCW exposure has occurred.\n- Administrative control measures should include an obligation and mechanism for reporting patient and HCW exposure incidents in every organization or jurisdiction, and a mechanism for assessing the risk of transmission.\n- Healthcare organizations should have written policies and procedures for post-exposure prophylaxis and management of exposed patients and HCWs. 4. All HCWs should know that a patient's possible exposure to a HCW's blood requires further management and that such events are reported in their facility/organization/jurisdiction.\n- All HCWs have an ethical and professional obligation to report and be tested (as per institutional policy) following an exposure to a patient's blood or body fluid or a patient's exposure to the HCW's blood.\nRecommendations for management of healthcare workers infected with HIV 1.\nAll HCWs who perform EPPs have ethical and professional obligations to know their HIV status.\nIf negative, those performing EPPs should be tested at appropriate intervals as determined by their level of risk and whenever an exposure has occurred.\n- HCWs infected with HIV should seek medical care from a physician with expertise in HIV management for optimal health maintenance and should be managed according to current recommendations with regular monitoring of HIV RNA levels. 4. HCWs infected with HIV should be restricted from performing EPPs until: a the HCW is under the care of a physician with expertise in HIV management; and b the HCW is either on effective combination antiretroviral therapy or has been identified as an elite controller; and c the HCW's viral load is undetectable. 5. HCWs infected with HIV who are on effective combination antiretroviral therapy (or are elite controllers), and have an undetectable viral load, should have no restrictions on practice based on HIV status alone.\n\n【12】 #Recommendations for management of healthcare workers infected with HCV\n- All HCWs who perform EPPs have ethical and professional obligations to know their HCV status. 2. If negative, those performing EPPs should be tested at appropriate intervals as determined by their level of risk and whenever an exposure has occurred. 3. Confirmation of active HCV infection should be done using HCV RNA testing. HCWs infected with HCV should seek medical care from a physician with expertise in HCV management for optimal health maintenance and should be managed according to current recommendations.\n- HCWs testing negative for HCV RNA 12 weeks post-treatment can be considered to have SVR and should have no restrictions on practice based on HCV status alone.\n- If a HCW-to-patient transmission of HCV occurs, the HCW should cease clinical practice immediately until determination for fitness to return to practice is made.\nRecommendations for HBV immunization for healthcare workers (pre-exposure prevention)\n- All susceptible HCWs (including students or trainees) should be immunized with hepatitis B (HB) vaccine, unless a medical contraindication exists.\n- Students should complete their vaccination series and demonstrate immunity prior to starting any clinical rotations.\n- If a HCW has documentation of receiving a complete HB vaccine series but does not have documentation of anti-HBs serology following immunization, or, if a HCW reports HB immunization but has incomplete or no documentation of HB immunization, serologic testing for anti-HBs should be done and then:\n- If an anti-HBs titre of at least 10 IU/L is confirmed, testing need not be repeated nor should further immunization be undertaken, with the exception of immunocompromised persons who should be tested periodically for waning immunity, and persons with chronic renal disease or on dialysis, who should be tested yearly. - If testing for anti-HBs is done 1 to 6 months after vaccination and the anti-HBs titre is less than 10 IU/L, a primary vaccine failure has occurred and the HCW should be given a second vaccine series. The HCW should be retested 1 to 6 months after completion of the second series.\n\n【13】 #Recommendations for management of healthcare workers infected with HBV\n- All HCWs who perform EPPs have ethical and professional obligations to know their HBV status.\n- HCWs who remain susceptible to HBV should be tested at appropriate intervals as determined by their level of risk and whenever an exposure has occurred.\n- HCWs born or previously residing in high HBV endemic countries should be tested for both anti-HBc and HBsAg to fully define HBV status. 4. HCWs infected with HBV should seek medical care from a physician with expertise in HBV management for optimal health maintenance and should be managed according to current recommendations with regular monitoring of HBV DNA level.\n- HCWs infected with HBV who do not perform EPPs do not need restrictions on practice based on HBV status alone.\n- If a HCW-to-patient transmission of HBV occurs, the HCW should cease clinical practice immediately until determination for fitness to return to practice is made.\nAbbreviations: anti-HBc, antibody to hepatitis B core antigen; HBcAg, Hepatitis B core antigen; HBsAg, Hepatitis B surface antigen\n\n【14】 #Recommendations for double gloving for infected healthcare workers\nThere is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against double gloving to prevent HCW-topatient transmission of a BBV.\n\n【15】 #Recommendations for healthcare workers' disclosure obligations and right to privacy\n- A HCW infected with a BBV who performs EPPs does not have an obligation to routinely disclose his or her serologic status to patients to obtain their informed consent provided that the HCW's health status and practice have been assessed by an Expert Review Panel and all the panel's recommendations are followed.\n- All HCWs, including those infected with a BBV, have a right to privacy and confidentiality of personal health information.\n\n【16】 - When a patient has been exposed to the blood of a HCW, the HCW must seek follow-up through their organizational process and the patient must be promptly informed of the nature of the exposure and the appropriate post-exposure protocol. However, the identity and confidentiality of the HCW should be protected to the greatest extent possible.\n\n【17】 #Summation\nThis guideline was developed with a rigorous methodology involving robust systematic reviews, a narrative review, environmental scans, summaries of published epidemiologic investigations, and grading of available evidence with consideration of collective expert opinion in the development of recommendations. Adhering to recommendations provided in this guideline will result in safer practice for HCWs infected with a bloodborne virus. As new evidence develops, it may be necessary to update the recommendations.\n\n【18】 #Purpose of Guideline\nThe Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) develops evidence-based infection prevention and control (IPC) guidelines. These guidelines support IPC professionals, occupational health professionals, healthcare organizations, and healthcare providers in developing, implementing and evaluating IPC policies, procedures and programs that improve the quality and safety of health care and patient outcomes. Recommendations provided in these guidelines complement provincial and territorial public health efforts in monitoring, preventing, and controlling healthcare-associated infections.\n\n【19】 #The purpose of this document, Guideline on the Prevention of Transmission of Bloodborne\nViruses from Infected Healthcare Workers in Healthcare Settings, is to provide a national framework for developing policies and procedures to prevent the transmission of three bloodborne viruses (BBVs), namely hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from infected healthcare workers (HCWs) to patients in the healthcare setting. These three viruses account for most cases of healthcare-associated transmission of BBVs reported worldwide  .\nThis evidence-based guideline replaces PHAC's 1998 Proceedings of the Consensus Conference on Infected Health Care Workers: Risk for Transmission of Bloodborne Pathogens  . Recommendations provided in this guideline apply to all HCWs, including student and trainee HCWs.\nFollowing these recommendations will result in safer practice for HCWs infected with a BBV.\nThe information in this guideline was current at the time of publication. Scientific knowledge and medical technology are constantly evolving. Therefore, research and revisions to keep pace with advances in the field are necessary.\nGuidelines, by definition, include principles and recommendations and should not be regarded as rigid standards. This guideline may need to be adapted to meet local, provincial and territorial requirements, or particular individual circumstances.\n\n【20】 #Target Audience\nThis guideline is intended to assist those involved with the assessment and management of HCWs infected with a BBV, either individually (e.g. treating physician, members of Expert Review Panels) or generally (e.g. regulatory authorities)\n\n【21】 #P even on o an m on o BBV om n e ed HCW o pa en\nLegend 1 Regulated HCWs employed federally must be registered with the regulatory authority in their province or territory of work. 2 In some P/T jurisdictions, students of regulated health professions are not regulated therefore responsibility for managing these HCWs lies with their educational institution.\nAbbreviations: P/T, provinces and territories; HCWs, healthcare workers; BBVs, bloodborne viruses\n\n【22】 #DESCRIPTION\nThis is followed by a summary of the risk of transmission of BBVs, risk of injury to HCWs, student and trainee considerations, and definition of exposure-prone procedures (EPPs). The risk of HCW-to-patient transmission is discussed by type of virus, and recommendations to prevent transmission and to manage infected HCWs are provided. Finally, the roles and responsibilities of Expert Review Panels, considerations for conducting lookback investigations, and HCW's disclosure obligations and their right to privacy are discussed.\n\n【23】 #2.1Guideline Development Process and Methodology\nThe core methods applied to the development of this guideline included identifying and reviewing existing guidelines, conducting a needs assessment, systematically reviewing evidence, grading the body of evidence, and synthesizing the evidence. A Guideline Development Task Group (Task Group) consisting of experts from across the country, developed recommendations based on available peer-reviewed evidence and collective expert opinion (where there was an absence of evidence). A broad consultation was conducted with key stakeholders to obtain feedback on the draft guideline. Relevant expert review and feedback continued throughout the development of this guideline.\n\n【24】 #Consultation\nThe Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) consulted with federal, provincial and territorial partners and key stakeholder organizations during the development of the guideline. This consultation consisted of two parts, a needs assessment conducted in 2011 and 2012 (prior to the development of the guideline), and a broad consultation conducted in 2017 and 2018 (upon completion of the first draft of the guideline).\nThe national organizations invited to complete or share the needs assessment questionnaire with their members were identified with the assistance of the Task Group based on the following criteria: 1 national scope; 2 health professional regulatory authorities with members who might perform EPPs; 3 health professional faculties with students and trainees who might perform EPPs; 4 organizations with subject matter experts that might participate in the expert review process of HCWs infected with a BBV; and 5 upon request of another organization. The organizations invited were: The needs assessment was conducted using an online questionnaire that could be completed by any individual from these organizations. Each organization determined their own process to complete the questionnaire therefore it was not possible to determine individual response rates for the needs assessment. In total, 120 questionnaires were returned with 82 of these completed in full and 38 partially completed. Respondents were from all provinces and territories in Canada. The data collected was exported to an Excel spreadsheet and an analysis was performed using qualitative and basic quantitative methods\n\n【25】 A broad consultation with federal, provincial and territorial partners and key stakeholder organizations was conducted upon development of the draft guideline. This involved a thorough review of the draft guideline by individual(s) within a stakeholder organization with a goal to: 1 identify potential issues and/or concerns with any of the recommendations, including their feasibility and applicability; 2 correct erroneous information, if any; and 3 encourage broad support for the recommendations across the country Each organization rolled up the individual feedback received into one organizational response and a completed feedback form was sent to PHAC. Each organization determined their own process to complete the feedback form therefore it was not possible to determine the response rates for the broad consultation.\nThe feedback received from the broad consultation primarily identified the need for:\nRevisions were made to the draft guideline where needed and a rationale was documented where revisions were not made because the suggested edits were considered to be unnecessary, erroneous, ambiguous or not supported by current evidence.\n\n【26】 #Review of the Literature\nA project protocol was developed to outline the steps and methods for reviewing relevant literature by conducting systematic reviews and environmental scans to inform recommendations provided in this guideline. The systematic review and environmental scan parameters, literature search strategy, and approach for evidence analysis were established prior to the initiation of the project. The project protocol was then circulated for internal comment and refinement by the Task Group and PHAC.\nA series of Key Questions were needed to clearly address the identified issues from the needs assessment as well as the defined scope and objectives of the guideline. Ten Key Questions were drafted by the PHAC writing team and reviewed by the Task Group. Each question was structured to focus on a fundamental issue to be addressed in the guideline. A systematic review was conducted for questions where a clearly defined population, intervention, comparator and outcome (PICO) were identified and/or where it was considered necessary to review existing data for consideration in the development of recommendations. There were some limitations in identifying adequate comparator interventions and available data was qualitatively synthesized. Seven of the 10 questions developed were addressed using a systematic review process. A published systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was available and therefore used, along with other studies, to inform one of the seven questions (i.e. clinical effectiveness of double gloving)1.3.\n\n【27】 #Systematic Reviews\nSystematic reviews were conducted to summarize the evidence for the risk of transmission of HIV, HCV, and HBV from infected HCWs to patients. The literature search parameters were developed upon review of the project outline developed by the Task Group.\nPrior to conducting the literature search, the Cochrane Collaboration Database of Systematic Reviews, the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews, the NIH Library of Systematic Review Protocols and Protocol Registries, the Database of Abstracts of Review of Effect, and the TRIP Database were searched for any previous systematic reviews that addressed this topic  . No published systematic review was found.\nLiterature search strategy concepts and keywords were selected for each topic. Four databases were reviewed: Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, Global Health and Scopus. Worldwide literature was searched from 1995 until the present. The literature search was conducted in 2013 and updated in 2015\nAll published research findings relevant to each sub-topic were reviewed. Scopus Search Alert, Global Health Search Alert, ProMED postings, Safe Injection Global Network, and the Public Health Agency of Canada Daily News were used to stay up-to-date with new studies after the formal literature searches were completed.\nRelevant articles were screened for eligibility for each systematic review. For the systematic reviews informing the preventive or management measures to reduce the risk of transmission of a BBV, the criteria for selecting eligible population included infected HCWs performing or assisting with EPPs (irrespective of whether transmission occurred) and those providing direct patient care involving non-EPPs but where transmission occurred.\nCritical appraisal of eligible studies was conducted using PHAC's Critical Appraisal Tool Kit (the Tool Kit) . The Tool Kit uses a grading scale that rates all levels of evidence from metaanalyses of randomized controlled trials to ecologic studies; and rates expert opinion lower than published scientific evidence. Within the hierarchy of scientific evidence, meta-analyses of RCTs are generally considered to be the best evidence available. For ethical and methodological reasons, RCTs are not feasible to assess potentially harmful situations such as the transmission of BBVs. In such situations, the best evidence becomes the evidence that exists at the highest level within the hierarchy of evidence. The body of evidence that exists to inform this guideline consists mostly of epidemiologic investigations of past exposure incidents. Although these studies are weak in design, they are nonetheless, the best available evidence informing this issue. As a result, the grade of evidence in this guideline falls within the range of CI to BII A grade of CII indicates where the evidence base consisted of low quality studies regardless of study design or existing studies reported contradictory results or there was a paucity of relevant studies thus the evidence was mostly based on expert opinion.\nEvidence from eligible studies were reviewed and summarized. A synthesis of evidence is provided along with the recommendations developed. Where there were insufficient published studies or inconclusive study results, a consensus of experts in the field provided recommendations specific to practice. In addition, current practice and complex ethical and legal issues were considered and discussed in the development of final recommendations.\n\n【28】 #Environmental Scans\nAn environmental scan of relevant literature (limited to English and French) was conducted for three Key Questions where the topic dealt with organizational, regulatory, and/or ethical issues not solely or directly informed by scientific research. This included the sections on disclosure of a HCW's serologic status, establishing Expert Review Panels and conducting lookback investigations.\nThe core methods used for conducting the environmental scans included identification and review of relevant documents obtained from a search of grey literature including policy documents, guidance from other organizations, and reports from government institutions or professional organizations outside of the indexed medical literature. These sources were used to identify the general consensus of opinion regarding these issues  . These sections were written as a text and/or tabular summary of the relevant literature.\nRecommendations not informed by a systematic review of the scientific literature or where the topic deals with organizational, regulatory, and/or ethical issues not solely or directly informed by scientific research have no grade of evidence assigned.\n\n【29】 #Guideline Development Task Group (Task Group)\nThe Guideline on the Prevention of Transmission of Bloodborne Viruses from Infected Healthcare Workers in Healthcare Settings is one in a series of Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) guidelines developed by PHAC. Technical expertise for the review of the evidence and development of recommendations were provided by the Task Group. The Task Group for this guideline was composed of members with expertise in infectious diseases, medical microbiology and virology, infection prevention and control, public health, occupational health, hepatology, dentistry, medical ethics and obstetrics and gynecology. The Task Group reported to PHAC's National Advisory Committee on Infection Prevention and Control.\n\n【30】 #List of Guideline Development Task Group Members\nParticipation in the Task Group does not constitute endorsement by affiliated organizations.\nThe following individuals formed the Task Group (affiliations were at time of development of the guideline):\n\n【31】 #Background\nHealthcare professionals, including physicians, dentists, nurses, physician assistants, dental hygienists and midwives, have an ethical and professional obligation to prioritize the well-being of their patients first, by providing safe, compassionate, competent and ethical care at all times  .\nThis responsibility includes minimizing the risk of exposure to pathogens within healthcare settings  . Certain surgical procedures may pose a risk of healthcare worker (HCW) injury with the possibility of exposing a patient to the blood of a HCW  . In 1998, Health Canada released recommendations from a consensus conference that was held to address the risk of transmission of bloodborne viruses (BBVs) from infected HCWs to patients  . This prompted key stakeholder organizations to develop policies on the issue. The policies of the professional regulatory authorities are direct and binding regulation on regulated HCWs infected with a BBV in Canada  . In addition, Medical Officers of Health, under their respective provincial or territorial Public Health Act, may issue an order to stop practice when an imminent risk to public health has been identified. This evidence-based guideline is intended to provide a framework for a pan-Canadian approach to the management of HCWs infected with a BBV.\nIllicit diversion of injectable patient medication by a HCW is considered malpractice and is not within the scope of this document.\nA review of the literature to inform this guideline revealed primarily lookback investigations and other descriptive studies. Inherent limitations with these study designs make it difficult to conclusively discern the contribution of various risk factors to the transmission of a BBV from an infected HCW to a patient. Information relating to exposure incidents and history of injection drug use or other personal risk factors reported in lookback investigations is generally obtained from interviews. Such reports do not allow for assessing the extent of recall bias (bias due to differences in accuracy of recollection of past events), interviewer bias (bias in how information is solicited, recorded, and interpreted), or social desirability bias (providing responses that are considered to be socially or politically desirable). The retrospective nature of lookback investigations limits the information obtained from the report to the data the authors had access to or chose to report. Moreover, incidences of transmission where no EPP was involved and IPC breaches were not reported pose additional questions and thus require careful review  . It is possible that an infected HCW who has very poor IPC practices could infect patients without doing exposure-prone procedures. Therefore, the situation of every infected HCW should be reviewed. This does not necessarily require a formal review by a panel, but at least a review of what procedures the HCW performs, how they follow IPC practices, and whether they are on treatment. It is also an opportunity to reinforce appropriate IPC practices.\n\n【32】 #Determinants of Risk of Transmission of Bloodborne Viruses\nThree determinants of risk influencing the likelihood of transmission of BBVs from infected HCWs to patients during an EPP have been previously outlined  . These include the risk of percutaneous injury for the HCW; risk of the contaminated instrument or HCW's blood contacting the patient's open tissues; and susceptibility of the patient. Although the HCW with high levels of circulating BBV may pose some risk if their blood contacts a patient, the risk approaches zero if that HCW is treated and eradicates (HCV) or decreases (HIV and HBV) circulating virus in their blood.\nFor each BBV, reported exposure incidents, regardless of whether transmission occurred, have been assessed to provide a comprehensive context for the development of this guideline. The extent of reporting bias for HCWs infected with a BBV and not implicated in transmission to patients via EPPs or non-EPPs is unknown. As a result, the risk of transmission of BBVs from HCWs to patients may be overestimated in the literature. A series of BBV transmission incidents have involved a chain of patient-to-HCW-to-patient transmissions  . The risk of transmission of BBVs from patients to HCWs during clinical activities is influenced by the prevalence of BBVs in the population, frequency of contact with infected patients, communicability of the BBV, immunologic status of the HCW, and years of experience with tasks that include blood exposure risk  . An increased prevalence of BBVs in a population served by HCWs who perform EPPs increases the risk of occupational exposure of HCWs to BBVs  . One urban academic hospital in the US reported that up to 38% of all surgical procedures conducted there involved exposure to HBV, HCV, and HIV  .\nDespite the perceived risk, a 2007 systematic review investigating a total of 6,956 HCW injuries with HCV-contaminated needles, found no cases of HCV seroconversion  . In one study, a total of 99 injuries occurred during 1,382 (7.1%) surgical procedures with 89% of these sustained by residents or attending surgeons. In 29 of the 99 injuries (32%) sustained by surgeons, the sharp instrument that caused the HCW injury contacted the patient after it had penetrated the HCW's skin  . Another study estimated that patients may be exposed to the blood of at least one HCW in as many as one in six cardiothoracic surgery procedures that carry a high exposure risk  . Many changes have occurred in the operating room environment since these studies were conducted, nonetheless, ongoing improvement to protect HCWs from sharps injuries will also protect patients from possible exposure to BBVs. Seroconversion of HCWs may not be recognized in a timely manner or prior to a patient exposure incident. In addition, published lookback investigations of patient exposure incidents show that very rarely is the exposure recognized during or immediately following the incident. If exposure is recognized, timely reporting of the exposure would allow for prompt initiation of post-exposure prophylaxis for the patient (for HIV and HBV)  .\nFrom a review of cases of BBV transmission from infected HCWs to patients worldwide, the factors that influence the risk of percutaneous injury and/or the risk of transmission of BBVs given HCW injury have been identified. These factors include ,29,38, :\n- Reports of potential patient exposure to HCWs infected with a BBV have identified dermatitis on the HCW's hands as one factor that may amplify the risk of transmission  . In one of these incidents, atopic eczema lesions prevented the HCW from wearing gloves systematically  . Another incident reported severe dermatitis on the HCW's hand with episodes of serous or bloody drainage from nodular lesions during the exposure period  . Adherence to Routine Practices should prevent transmission of BBVs via dermatitis  .\n\n【33】 #Perception and Comparison of Risk\nAlong with the actual risks of transmission of BBVs, the risk perceived by the public has to be considered in determining acceptable risk  . Generally, people are more fearful of things that are extremely unlikely but considered beyond their control  . While zero risk is unattainable, every reasonable effort should be made to reduce the risk to a minimum with recommendations striking a balance between the rights and reasonable expectations of the public (informed consent and protection from harm) and the rights and reasonable expectations of individual HCWs (privacy and freedom from discrimination)  .\nPatient safety studies show that the most frequent types of adverse events affecting hospitalized patients are adverse drug events, wound infections, and surgical complications  .\nConsidering HCW's access to both effective treatment for HCV and effective vaccine against HBV, and the minimal risk of HCW-to-patient transmission of HIV, it is reasonable to expect that measures taken to address the risk of a BBV transmission from HCW to patient should avoid triggering public fears, unduly restricting individual freedom, or violating human rights  .\nIt has been reported that the risk of physicians transmitting BBVs to patients will continue to fall as more effective methods of prevention and treatment are identified  . To date, there are no documented cases of transmission of any BBV from Canadian dentists to patients, and also no documented transmissions of either HIV or HCV from Canadian physicians to patients, This incident occurred prior to the availability of modern antiviral therapy for HBV  . In addition, there have been numerous investigations of infected HCWs that did not identify transmission of a BBV.\n\n【34】 #Risk of Injury to a Healthcare Worker\nWith the introduction of routine hepatitis B (HB) vaccination, most HCWs are protected from infection with this BBV, virtually eliminating the risk of HCW-to-patient transmission. On the other hand, multiple percutaneous injuries throughout a HCW's career may place them at risk for occupational acquisition of HIV or HCV infection that may go unnoticed and therefore not treated. This in turn may pose minimal risk of transmission to patients in the event of a HCW injury while performing an EPP  .\nSurveillance of HCW occupational exposures indicates that percutaneous injuries are the most commonly reported route of HCW exposure to blood or bodily fluid  . Bloodborne infections and injuries occurring in the year 2000 in 14 geographical regions and four age groups were assessed.\nOverall, it was estimated that 1,000 HIV, 16,000 HCV, and 66,000 HBV infections may have occurred among HCWs worldwide due to occupational exposure through percutaneous injuries  .\nRisk of injury, and by extrapolation risk of BBV transmission to HCWs who perform EPPs, is dependent on the types of procedures they do. Certain HCWs such as laboratory technologists, phlebotomists, and surgeons perform procedures that have an increased incidence of injury and occupational exposure. Sharps and needlestick injuries are reported to be about six times more common among surgical personnel compared with nonsurgical personnel  .\nIt has been reported that most dental HCWs (dentists, hygienists, assistants and oral surgeons) experience approximately three injuries per year  . A survey of a random sample of 300 dentists found that all respondents had protocols in place for managing and reporting sharp injuries to dental team members but only 48% of respondents had protocols for reporting patient exposures to the blood of a member of the dental team  . Dental HCWs were previously reported to have a low risk for occupationally acquired HIV but a higher risk for acquiring HBV than the average citizen  . With the development of a vaccine against HBV, the risk for acquiring HBV has been mostly mitigated for HCWs.\nAdequate training and education on the prevention and management of occupational exposures is fundamental for HCWs as part of an occupational health program for sharps safety and prevention of exposure to BBVs  .\n\n【35】 #HEALTHCARE WORKER STUDENT AND TRAINEE SPECIFIC ISSUES\nKey issues that have been identified for the health and safety of HCW students and trainees include necessary training in IPC, reducing the risk of occupational injury, assessment of immunization status, and confirming immunity to vaccine-preventable diseases (e.g. HBV) as early as possible on admission into health professional training programs ,19.\nA prospective cohort study showed that medical students had a high risk for needlestick injuries, which most commonly occurred in the operating room  . A more recent study reported that 28% of medical students, 83% of residents and/or fellows and 100% of faculty had been exposed to a sharp injury at some point in their career  . By the final year of training, 99% of surgical residents have had a needlestick injury, with 53% of these injuries involving a high risk patient (patient with a history of a BBV infection or injection drug use)  . Occupational injuries among HCWs in dentistry show the highest rate of exposure occurs among dental students and assistants, with needlestick injuries predominating  .\nThe increased risk of injury among medical, dental and nursing students and trainees, if not mitigated, could pose a concern for students, trainees and patients. Education of student and trainee HCWs on risks and precautions, immunizations, use of less invasive procedures, protection strategies to minimize risk of injuries (e.g. use of safety engineered devices), and procedures to manage exposures will improve student and trainee knowledge and reduce their exposure risk  .\nDespite increased rates of occupational sharp injuries to students and trainees, the risk for this group of HCWs to acquire a BBV, followed by secondary transmission to patients is still considered to be minimal. Professional schools should provide education to all students and trainees regarding the implications of infection with a BBV. Medical students are very unlikely to be performing exposure-prone procedures and transmission in dental school has not been reported in the literature. Strategies to reduce student and trainee injuries are primarily for their health and safety.\n\n【36】 #EXPOSURE-PRONE PROCEDURES\nExposure-prone procedures (EPPs) are invasive procedures where there is a risk that injury to the HCW may result in the exposure of the patient's open tissues to the blood of the HCW. For transmission of a BBV from an infected HCW to patient to occur during an EPP, three conditions are necessary  :\n- HCW must sustain an injury or have a condition that allows for exposure 2. HCW's blood must come in contact with a patient's wound, traumatized tissue, mucous membranes, or similar portal of entry 3. HCW must be sufficiently viremic EPPs with risk of transmission include  :\na. Digital palpation of a needle tip in a body cavity (a hollow space within the body or one of its organs); or the simultaneous presence of the HCW's fingers and a needle or other sharp instrument or object (such as bone splinters, sternal wires etc.) in a blind or highly confined anatomic site, e.g. as may occur during major abdominal, cardiothoracic, vaginal, pelvic and/or orthopedic operations b. Repair of major traumatic injuries c. Cutting or removal of any oral or perioral tissue, during which the patient's open tissues may be exposed to the blood of an injured infected HCW.\nTransmission has been documented with several surgical and dental procedures, most of which meet the above definition of an EPP. There is insufficient evidence to accurately categorize most surgical, dental and medical procedures in terms of transmission risk  . As a result, risk categories developed so far have been based on expert consensus on the risk of contact between the HCW's blood and that of the patient  .\nFailure to adhere to IPC principles identified as Routine Practices could result in transmission of BBVs during a procedure Documented transmissions via non-EPPs have to be assessed on a case-by-case basis in order to rule out IPC breaches, illicit diversion of patient medication involving reuse of needles for self-injection by a HCW, and determine the possible mechanism(s) of transmission.\n\n【37】 #Specialty Procedures\nCardiothoracic Valve replacement surgery ,41,76, surgery Coronary artery bypass graft surgery ,41,76, Pulmonary surgery  Other bypass surgery  Valve and coronary artery replacement  Thymectomy  Open-lung biopsy  Repair of congenital heart defects  Orthotopic heart transplantation  Orthopedic Placement of a total hip prosthesis with bone graft\nsurgery\n\n【38】 Abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery  Aorta bifurcation prosthesis  Ligation and stripping of varicose veins\n\n【39】 #Procedures\nDentistry and Extraction of two maxillary third molars under local anaesthesia; prophylaxis, and cosmetic oral surgery bonding  Abbreviations: BBV, bloodborne virus; HCW, healthcare worker A Procedures reported in the literature which involved transmission of HIV, HCV or HBV. Only procedures that are named in the investigations are included and where multiple procedures were done on a patient, it was not indicated which procedure was involved in transmission. All procedures done on a single patient are listed as a single line item. Where more than one patient had identical procedures, it was listed only once.\n\n【40】 #Recommendations for Healthcare Worker and Patient Exposures A\nRecommendations 1. Every organization or jurisdiction should have a mechanism for risk assessment to determine whether a patient or HCW exposure has occurred.\n- Administrative control measures should include an obligation and mechanism for reporting patient and HCW exposure incidents in every organization or jurisdiction, and a mechanism for assessing the risk of transmission.\n- Healthcare organizations should have written policies and procedures for post-exposure prophylaxis and management of exposed patients and HCWs.\n- All HCWs have an ethical and professional obligation to report and be tested (as per institutional policy) following an exposure to a patient's blood or body fluid or a patient's exposure to the HCW's blood.\nA The term 'HCWs' in this document includes students and trainees.\n\n【41】 #RISK OF TRANSMISSION OF HIV\nThere is a lack of consistency in the body of evidence relating to viral load units of measurement for BBVs. In this document, HIV viral load is reported as copies/mL as this is the current reporting practice for Canadian laboratories.\n\n【42】 #Incidence and Prevalence of HIV\nThe prevalence of HIV infection in the general Canadian population rose steadily during the 1980s, corresponding to the initial rise of HIV incidence in the Canadian population  . In 2016, PHAC reported an estimated 2,165 new HIV infections in Canada  . Approximately 63,110 people were living with HIV (including AIDS) by the end of 2016, representing a 5% increase from the estimate at the end of 2014  .\nAlthough surveillance data are limited by underreporting, an increase in numbers of people living with HIV has been observed since the late 1990s. This may largely be related to the development of more effective, less toxic and better-tolerated therapies. These developments delayed the progression of HIV to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), resulting in reduced mortality  .\nIn addition to the potential risk for occupational exposure, HCWs can have the same risk factors for acquiring HIV as the general population (e.g. injection drug use, sexual contact). There are currently no published HIV prevalence data among HCWs in Canada. The total number of reported AIDS cases among adults in Canada (15 or older) due to occupational exposure from 1979 to 2012 is 9, with 7 of these cases occurring before 2006  . The setting for these occupational transmissions was not reported.\n\n【43】 #Estimated Risk of HIV Transmission\nStudies have estimated the risk of HIV transmission from patients to HCWs after percutaneous injury to range from about 0% to 3%  :\n-deep injury, -injury with a device that was visibly contaminated with the source's blood (larger volume of blood), -exposures involving a needle placed in the source's artery or vein, -exposure to a source who died of AIDS within two months after the exposure (possibly due to higher titre of HIV in the blood), and -lack of post-exposure prophylaxis.\nIt is reasonable to assume that the same risk factors for seroconversion apply to transmission of HIV from HCWs to patients. There is very limited evidence of transmission of HIV from an infected HCW to a patient during an EPP The development of effective antiretroviral therapies, and their use by HCWs or patients infected with HIV will minimize the risk of transmission in the event of an exposure during an EPP  .\n\n【44】 #Review of Patient Exposure Incidents with Transmission of HIV\nIn the worldwide literature search conducted for this systematic review, published investigations reported HIV transmission from five infected HCWs to patients. For four of the infected HCWs, the exposure incidents involved an EPP.\nIn the early 1990s, a number of publications documented epidemiologic investigations involving patients of a dentist infected with HIV in the USA  .\nThe second transmission event was published in 1999 with a probable transmission of HIV from an orthopedic surgeon to a patient in France  . About 33% of his patients were tested, and one was found to be infected with HIV. This patient was operated on three times by the infected surgeon with prolonged duration of potential exposure during one difficult procedure that lasted over 10 hours  .\nIt is possible that other HIV transmission incidents from HCW to patient have occurred but have not been published A total of 12,550 patients were reported to be exposed to 4 HCWs infected with HIV. Of these patients, a total of 4,261 (34%) had their HIV status examined. Transmission of HIV from HCWs to patients occurred in 9 of these patients with 6 of these transmissions possibly involving IPC breaches\n\n【45】 #Number of patients infected\nDentistry  1\nNursing  1 7580 2293  1 Obstetrics and gynecology  1 275 250 , 91 For purposes of informing the systematic review question (What preventive or management measures can reduce the risk of transmission of HIV from infected HCWs to their patients?), data were extracted from all eligible epidemiologic investigations where HCW-to-patient transmission was reported. Epidemiologic investigations of all four published investigations were eligible for inclusion in the systematic review.

D IPC compliance: HCW was compliant with current IPC standards. E Symptomatic: HCW was symptomatic during screening period. F Treatment: HCW was previously treated or was on treatment during screening period. G Practice review: HCW's practice was previously reviewed by independent expert(s) and recommendations made.\nH Percutaneous injury: Percutaneous injury potentially exposing patient to HCW's blood was reported. I Patient PEP: Post-exposure prophylaxis was offered to exposed patient(s). J Diversion ruled out: Illicit diversion of patient medication by HCW was ruled out. K The HCW was on and off treatment while practising (non-adherent). L Although no percutaneous injury potentially exposing the infected patient was recorded, the HCW reported frequent injuries and noted blood under his gloves more than once a week. M The HCW was unaware of their serologic status at the time of the index patient's exposure incident but was aware after being hospitalized and diagnosed in 1996  .\n\n【46】 #Review of Patient Exposure Incidents with No Transmission of HIV\nIn 1995, a summary of all published and unpublished investigations from the CDC database showed that among 22,171 patients who were treated by 51 HCWs infected with HIV (29 dentists and dental students, 8 physicians and medical students, 13 surgeons or obstetricians, and 1 podiatrist), a total of 113 patients with HIV were reported  . Results from epidemiologic and laboratory testing did not indicate that a HCW was the source of any of these infections.\nThe only publicly available HIV lookback investigation conducted in Canada was done in 2004 and involved 2,560 patients operated on by an infected HCW at a pediatric hospital  . In this report, a total of 2175 patients (85%) were tested and no HIV infections were identified.\nA review of all investigations of potential exposure to BBVs in healthcare settings in Ireland was conducted between 2007 and 2011  . This study identified one lookback investigation that involved testing 66 potentially exposed patients for HIV; no case of transmission from the infected HCW was identified.\nA total of 41,939 patients were reported to be exposed to 36 HCWs infected with HIV in a variety of healthcare settings. Of these patients, a total of 18,391 (44%) had their HIV status examined and no transmission was found For purposes of informing the systematic review question (What preventive or management measures can reduce the risk of transmission of HIV from infected HCWs to their patients?), data were extracted from all eligible epidemiologic investigations where no transmission was reported. Of the 44 epidemiologic investigations with no documented transmission of HIV, 15 investigations (all involving EPPs) were eligible for inclusion in the systematic review\n11  1  1  0  0  1  Total No EPP (non-EPP) 7  1  1  4  6  6  0  0  Total NR EPP (non-EPP) 5  9  3  10  8  9  15  14\nAbbreviations: HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; EPP, exposure-prone procedure; IPC: infection prevention and control; PEP, post-exposure prophylaxis; NR, not reported; HCW, healthcare worker A N=15 for total number of infected HCWs from all reported investigations. B If EPPs and non-EPPs performed by a HCW (e.g. dentistry), data from article was pooled under EPP. C Aware of status: HCW was aware of serologic status prior to exposure incident(s). D IPC compliance: HCW was compliant with current IPC standards. E Symptomatic: HCW was symptomatic during screening period. F Treatment: HCW was previously treated or was on treatment during screening period. G Practice review: HCW's practice was previously reviewed by independent expert(s) and recommendations made. An obvious limitation in all lookback investigations is that only a percentage of potentially exposed patients are tested. Although it is not clear what the minimal criteria are to reliably conclude that there was no evidence of transmission in an exposure episode (e.g. magnitude of the lookback investigation or minimum percentage of exposed patients that should be tested), it has been indicated that available studies collectively provide evidence that the overall risk of transmission from HCWs infected with HIV to patients is \"likely to be very low\"  . Although this risk is not zero, it can be rendered negligible if HCWs infected with HIV who perform EPPs adhere to recommendations that have addressed the identified risk factors from previous exposure incidents.\nRecommendations provided for minimizing risk of HCW-to-patient transmission of HIV have taken into consideration preventive measures and risk factors reported in exposure incidents to date.\n\n【47】 #HIV Viral Load\nDeciding on a viral load cut-off level to determine an infected HCW's fitness for practice increases patient safety and optimizes the work force. High viral load is associated with both the acute phase of the infection (which may go unnoticed) and with late-stage AIDS at which time the HCW is more likely to be symptomatic  . Currently, there is a paucity of empirical data relating viral load and occupational transmissibility of HIV in a quantitative manner. Instances of HIV transmission during an EPP without documented IPC breaches have not provided robust data to inform a viral load cut off. This is primarily because the HCW's viral load at time of patient exposure, although expected to be high was most often not reported or unknown  .\nAlthough viral load at the time of an exposure incident is usually not available, studies discussed thus far indicate that regardless of viral load, the risk of HIV transmission through an EPP is minimal. A 10-year lookback investigation involving 545 of 1,669 patients operated on by a cardiothoracic surgeon infected with HIV found no transmission occurred despite a viral load over 100,000 copies/mL at time of diagnosis  .\nIn conducting the systematic review to inform HIV infectivity or transmissibility related to viral load, the selection criteria allowed for inclusion of studies with blood-to-blood exposure and the reported time between potential exposure and source viral load determination This allows for an analysis of HIV transmission (or absence thereof) from one person to another with different viral loads reported during exposure Overall, the studies did not show a consistent trend between high viral load and increased infectivity or transmissibility. In one study involving a HCW exposed to a high viral load of 5.3 x 10 7 copies/mL (via a deep needlestick injury), HIV transmission did not occur  . The lowest viral load at which HIV transmission occurred from one individual to another via a definite blood-to-blood exposure was 1500 copies/mL  .\nThe demand for accurate, reproducible, and cost-effective viral load assays is recognized at a global level  . Studies have shown that certain assays are less reliable for accurate viral load measurements. Genetic variation in HIV subtypes or extreme divergence within HIV subtypes may also significantly affect the ability to detect and quantify the viral RNA in clinical specimens Standardizing assays and units for measuring BBV viral load will allow for more accurate comparison across studies.\nMost individuals initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) experience effective and prolonged control of viral replication in the plasma  . The impact of time of initiation of therapy on viral suppression and optimization of treatment outcome has been discussed in several studies ,79,183. In a study investigating HCW's exposure risk during surgical procedures on patients infected with HIV, the patients' viral load was reduced prior to surgery. This was done in an effort to ensure the safety of the operating team and best possible conditions for patients  . Collectively, these studies suggest that antiretroviral therapy lowers viral load thus minimizing the risk of HCW-to-patient or patient-to-HCW transmission. To date, there has not been a single reported case of HCW-to-patient transmission of HIV from an infected HCW receiving and adhering to antiretroviral therapy  . The reported transmission incidents involved untreated or treatment non-adherent HCWs. This suggests that recommendations to minimize risk of transmission should focus on treatment of infected HCWs as a means to maintain a low viral load. Strict adherence to therapy is essential for sustained HIV suppression, reduced risk of drug resistance, improved overall health, quality of life, and survival, as well as decreased risk of HIV transmission.\n\n【48】 #Elite Controllers\nElite controllers are defined as individuals infected with HIV who are not receiving therapy and have maintained undetectable viral load in the blood (HIV RNA < 50 copies/mL) for at least one year, based on three separate viral load assessments  . This spontaneous control of viral replication in the absence of therapy is estimated to occur in approximately 1 in 300 individuals infected with HIV  .\nAlthough elite controllers have undetectable viremia by standard clinical assays, when using more sensitive assays for RNA detection in the plasma, studies have reported that almost all elite controllers have detectable levels of plasma viremia and viral 'blips' of > 50 copies/mL occur ,192. This shows that virus from elite controllers is replication-competent and has no substantial genetic defect. Additional studies involving elite controllers show that despite undetectable plasma RNA levels, residual viral replication occurs in the absence of therapy and contributes to a chronic inflammation state . H Application of topical therapy to active psoriasis lesions without gloves. I Source with HIV-HCV co-infection. J Source had measurement of two plasma VL samples while being cared for by the exposed person. The exposed person was likely infected in 1999 with possible seroconversion illness seven months prior to source's death. During the exposure period, the source was not on treatment from February to July 1999. K The source individual was on highly active antiretroviral therapy at the time of the fight. L The source patient was HIV-HCV co-infected. The exposed person received an expanded 3-drug HIV PEP. There was no HIV transmission however, HCV was transmitted. M Coma in injection drug user. N The HCW delayed in reporting the injury so commencement of PEP was delayed for 84 hours. O Patient admitted with a diagnosis of dementia.\n\n【49】 #Recommendations for Management of Healthcare Workers Infected with HIV\nRecommendations A 1.\nAll HCWs who perform EPPs have ethical and professional obligations to know their HIV status B .\nIf negative, those performing EPPs should be tested at appropriate intervals as determined by their level of risk and whenever an exposure has occurred.\n\n【50】 #Grade of evidence: CI\nThe full critical appraisal tool informing this scale can be found in PHAC's Critical Appraisal Tool Kit  . B Ethical obligation may be traced to principles of non-maleficence (the duty to intentionally refrain from actions that cause harm), which includes an obligation for HCWs not to impose risks of harm to patients and creates a standard of due care 209 C There are variations in minimum detectable viral load thresholds for different assays. In addition, there may be situations where very low viral loads and/or transient blips (up to 400 copies/mL) may occur. These blips may not be clinically relevant and thus do not indicate treatment failure and will not necessarily trigger practice restrictions or lookback investigations. However, some jurisdictions may manage transient blips by maintaining stricter or more conservative thresholds\n\n【51】 #RISK OF TRANSMISSION OF HCV\nThere is a lack of consistency in the body of evidence relating to viral load units of measurement for BBVs. In this document, HCV viral load is reported as IU/mL (copies/mL) as this is the current reporting practice for Canadian laboratories and the WHO  .\n\n【52】 #Incidence and Prevalence of HCV\nThe first Canadian study to report seroprevalence of HCV infection based on a nationally representative household sample was the Canadian Health Measures Survey (CHMS) conducted from 2007 to 2011  . Estimates in this study are based on data collected from 8,434 survey respondents. Although the number of new cases of HCV in Canada has decreased in recent years, the number of prevalent cases remains high. Data from the CHMS, showed that an estimated 0.5% (95% CI: 0.3-0.9) of the population, representing a total of approximately 138,600 (95% CI: 55,800-221,300) people (aged 14-79 years) had laboratory evidence of an HCV infection as identified by HCV antibody  . Hepatitis C infection was more common in the 50-79 year old group compared to the 14-49 year old group and in individuals living in lower income households. A modelling study estimated that between 0.64 and 0.71% of the overall Canadian population was living with chronic HCV infection in 2011 and 44% of these individuals were undiagnosed  .\n\n【53】 In addition to the potential risk for occupational exposure, HCWs are subject to the same nonoccupational risk factors for HCV as the general population. It is not known if the prevalence of HCV among Canadian HCWs is similar to that reported for the general public. This information as well as a Canadian estimate of the rate of transmission from infected HCWs to patients is needed to determine the true risk of transmission in Canada.\n\n【54】 #Estimated Risk of HCV Transmission\nThe risk of transmission of HCV through contaminated blood exposure, as estimated from modelling studies and lookback investigations has been found to be higher than that for transmission of HIV  .\n04 to 3.7%. Generalizations regarding risk cannot be made from these transmission studies as the rates vary according to circumstances unique to each incident, such as viral load of infected HCW, sample size of the lookback investigation, and possible IPC breaches. As a result, mathematical modelling studies are also used to estimate the risk of transmission of HCV. One modelling study concluded that the risk of transmission of HCV from an infected surgeon to patient(s) is about 0.0062 to 0.057%, corresponding to 1 chance in 1,750 to 1 in 16,000 procedures  . When the surgeon's serologic status was unknown, the risk of transmission during a single operation was about 0.00008 to 0.000074%, corresponding to 1 chance in 135,000 to 1 in 1.2 million. This risk is comparable to the chance of acquiring HCV by receiving a blood transfusion from first-time donors who have previously screened negative for HCV antibodies  . Literature reviews show that the risk of HCW-to-patient HCV transmission (in incidents where illicit diversion of injectable patient medication by HCWs was considered unlikely) was less than 0.6%  .\nTo estimate the rate of transmission of HCV from infected HCWs to patients from reported HCV exposure incidents, a meta-analysis of eligible exposure incidents was conducted . A total of 9 incidents were eligible for the meta-analysis with 2 of them involving no transmission of HCV. The pooled transmission rate for HCV using the random effects DerSimonian-Laird model was 0.46% (95% CI: 0.07-1.17%). This corresponds to a chance of 460 per 100,000 individuals (95% CI: 70 to 1170 per 100,000 individuals) becoming infected in the absence of IPC breaches and illicit diversion of patient medication.\n\n【55】 #Review of Patient Exposure Incidents with Transmission of HCV\nIt is likely that other transmission incidents have occurred but were either not published or not reported as exposures are often unrecognized and the asymptomatic phase of HCV infection can last many years, so transmission is not easily detected. The majority of investigations were triggered by patients showing symptoms of acute hepatitis C or testing positive for HCV following surgical procedures. According to the reports from these investigations, a total of at least 13,494 patients were considered to be exposed to HCV during EPPs and in a few cases non-EPPs performed by HCWs infected with HCV. In most cases, the HCWs were either unaware of their HCV status or the study did not report on their awareness. As a result, the infected HCWs continued to perform EPPs without seeking medical attention for their infection. Of the exposed patients, a total of 8,652 (64%) were tested for HCV. Transmission of HCV from HCWs to patients occurred in 30 of these patients.\nIn comparison to HIV and HBV transmissions, cases of HCW-to-patient HCV transmission were disproportionately attributed to confirmed or suspected HCW illicit diversion of patient medications involving reuse of needles for self-injection by the HCW. These situations often involved infected anesthesiologists or nurse anesthetists. A recent systematic review of HCV infections from healthcare-associated outbreaks between 1999 to 2012 showed that up to 50% were attributable to HCW tampering (diversion, self-injection, and substitution) of anesthetic opioids  . Transmission risk from tampering was substantially higher than from surgery\nSome investigations revealed possible or known breaches in IPC practices as the mechanism of transmission, and therefore, may not inform recommendations for risk of transmission during an EPP ,50,134. However, these studies may provide insight into possible mechanism(s) of HCV transmission during a non-EPP. In Canada, the only reported outbreak of HCV in a tertiary-care hospital involved IPC breaches by HCWs participating in and performing procedures on each other as part of a research study, which resulted in HCV transmission from one infected healthcare technologist to 4 other HCWs. A subsequent lookback investigation to assess for HCW-to-patient transmission did not identify any patients infected  .\nA case report of HCV transmission from an infected anesthetist to a patient without EPPs was reported in 2005  . This was the first case of transmission where the anesthetist was known to be HCV-RNA positive prior to the procedure and adhered to existing IPC protocols to minimize the risk of transmission. The anesthetist's HCV-RNA level was not available at the time of the exposure incident, but was found to be 11 million copies/mL when tested several years later. The anesthetist inserted a cuffed oral endotracheal tube and also inserted a peripheral cannula. The HCW denied any possibility of injection drug use, reported no open wounds, IPC breaches, or injuries during the procedure. The study authors postulated that transmission may have occurred by HCV shed from abrasions to the anesthetist and then inoculated to the patient via microabrasions. The study did not report on whether the anesthetist had undergone treatment for HCV infection. Another report of HCW-to-patient transmission of HCV during a non-EPP involved an infected home care nurse. This incident draws attention to the risk of transmission in home care settings and the challenges of confirming direction of transmission  . Identification of the mechanism and implications of transmission of HCV from an infected HCW to a patient in the absence of EPP and no reported IPC breach may require a closer review of these incidents  . Among patients with acute HCV infection in Italy and Spain, a documented risk factor was hospitalization without any invasive procedure in some patients  .\nSeveral studies show that EPPs were the sole or major mechanism of transmission and are therefore the basis upon which risk of transmission of HCV from an infected HCW to a patient and recommendations for prevention are based ,75,76,109,112,113,118,120,219.\nMost of the infected patients (21 out of 30) acquired their infection from either infected cardiothoracic surgeons or obstetrician/gynecologists.\nA transmission incident that was recognized in 2012, involved a retired obstetrician / gynecologist who had practised for over 30 years and was unaware of an HCV infection until after retirement  . In an extensive lookback investigation spanning over 18 years, four out of 5500 patients (0.07%) were found to be infected (to date of writing this guideline)  . In another episode, an infected midwife who worked on the post-natal unit transmitted HCV to one patient  .\nFor purposes of informing the systematic review question (What preventive or management measures can reduce the risk of transmission of HCV from infected HCWs to their patients?), data were extracted from all eligible epidemiologic investigations where HCW-to-patient transmission was reported. Seventeen such investigations were eligible for inclusion in the systematic review. Nine of the 17 investigations involved an EPP  3 7  Abbreviations: HCV, hepatitis C virus; EPP, exposure-prone procedure; IPC, infection prevention and control; NR, not reported; HCW, healthcare worker A N=17 for total number of infected HCWs from all reported investigations. B If EPPs and non-EPPs performed by a HCW (e.g. dentistry), data from article was pooled under EPP. C Aware of status: HCW was aware of serologic status prior to exposure incident(s). D IPC compliance: HCW was compliant with current IPC standards. E Symptomatic: HCW was symptomatic during screening period. F Treatment: HCW was previously treated or was on treatment during screening period. G Practice review: HCW's practice was previously reviewed by independent expert(s) and recommendations made. H Percutaneous injury: Percutaneous injury potentially exposing patient to HCW's blood was reported. I Diversion ruled out: Illicit diversion of patient medication by HCW was ruled out. J Several articles indicate that although a percutaneous injury during an EPP on a specific patient was not described, injuries were reported to occur during certain procedures. The HCWs could not recall ever bleeding into a patient's wound  . The specialty of the infected HCW was not reported, however, as it was reported that the infected HCW did not wear gloves systematically, the data have been pooled in the non-EPP column.\n\n【56】 #Review of Patient Exposure Incidents with No Transmission of HCV\nPublished epidemiologic investigations for HCV transmission from eleven infected HCWs to patients did not find any cases of transmission Exposure incidents due to five of the infected HCWs are documented in a single report  . A total of 9,837 patients were reported to be exposed to the nine HCWs infected with HCV. Of these patients, a total of 5,738 (58%) had their HCV status examined and no transmission was found Infection prevention and control breaches were reported in three of the investigations\nC Information on two additional HCWs infected with HCV is not included due to missing data on the number of potentially exposed and tested patients.\nFor purposes of informing the systematic review question (What preventive or management measures can reduce the risk of transmission of HCV from infected HCWs to their patients?), data were extracted from all eligible epidemiologic investigations where no transmission was reported. Three such investigations were eligible for inclusion in the systematic review. Two of the three investigations involved an EPP  Recommendations provided for minimizing risk of HCW-to-patient transmission of HCV have taken into consideration preventive measures and risk factors reported in exposure incidents to date.\n0  0  0  0  1  0  Total No EPP (non-EPP) 2  1  1  1  0  0  0  Total NR EPP (non-EPP) 0  1  1  1  2  1  2,\n\n【57】 #HCV Viral Load\nAcute HCV infection is often asymptomatic, therefore detection and diagnosis can be difficult. Studies show that intermittent low level HCV viremia can occur up to two months before the period of exponential increase in viral load and the high titre plateau-phase viremia that usually precede seroconversion  . In general, 50 to 85% of people infected with HCV develop chronic infections with some variability based on certain factors  .\nHigh viral load appears to be a major determinant influencing an infected individual's efficiency in transmitting HCV  . Most of the viral load testing conducted in lookback investigations of patients exposed to an infected HCW was done months after the exposure episode, perhaps making this information unreliable for determining infectivity based on viral load at the time of exposure.\nComplete spontaneous or therapy-induced resolution of HCV infection can occur  . Spontaneous clearance of HCV is found to occur more frequently among those who experience symptomatic HCV with high viral titres, and occurs during the first 3 to 6 months of infection  .\nHepatitis C viremia is unusual after successful treatment, which is defined as sustained virologic response (SVR) or undetectable HCV RNA 8-12 weeks after therapy is completed  . A meta-analysis reported that SVR appears durable in the majority of patients at 5 years posttreatment with a summary 5-year recurrence risk of 0.95% among HCV mono-infected \"lowrisk\" patients  . Notably, the higher pooled estimates of recurrence observed in high-risk and coinfected cohorts were driven by an increase in reinfection rather than late relapse. Sustained virologic response with undetectable HCV-RNA following completion of current HCV therapy is considered a durable and clinically significant endpoint  .\nThere is not much variability reported in viral loads of HCWs infected with HCV involved in transmission incidents (between 10 5 to 10 7 IU/mL) and there is no viral load that is considered non-infective. In conducting the systematic review to inform HCV infectivity or transmissibility related to viral load, the selection criteria allowed for inclusion of studies with blood-to-blood exposure and the reported time between potential exposure and source viral load determination.\nThis allows for an analysis of HCV transmission (or absence thereof) from one person to another with different viral loads reported during exposure\nThe risk of transmission of HCV can be eliminated with treatment of the infected HCW resulting in no detectable HCV RNA in the blood. As a result, recommendations provided for managing HCWs infected with HCV are focused on treatment rather than identifying a viral load cut-off level for fitness-for-work.

L Articles identified as companion articles provide supplementary information about the specific epidemiologic investigation included in the systematic review\nM The authors report as a possible case of HCW-to-patient transmission during home care as they were not able to determine the direction of transmission as the serologic status of the HCW was not known prior to the investigation  . In 2010, the authors report that an audit of the HCW's IPC practices is ongoing  ; in 2011, they emphasize the importance of HCWs wearing gloves if exposed to blood, in addition to other routine IPC practices  . N  .\nB Ethical obligation may be traced to principles of non-maleficence (the duty to intentionally refrain from actions that cause harm), which includes an obligation for HCWs not to impose risks of harm to patients and creates a standard of due care 209 . C Due to the availability of effective therapy for HCV with sustained virologic response, this guideline does not recommend a serum HCV RNA cut off level for practice restrictions as recommended in other guidelines. D The overarching principle for management of HCWs infected with HCV who perform EPPs is to restrict practice while the virus is detectable\n\n【58】 #RISK OF TRANSMISSION OF HBV\nThere is a lack of consistency in the body of evidence relating to viral load units of measurement for BBVs. In this document, HBV viral load is reported as IU/mL (GE/mL) as this is the current reporting practice for Canadian laboratories and WHO  .\n\n【59】 #Incidence and Prevalence of HBV\n\n【60】 Approximately half of all HBV cases are asymptomatic and approximately half of individuals infected with HBV are unaware of their status. As a result, the true incidence of HBV infection is most likely significantly underestimated  .\nThe introduction of the HBV vaccine in 1982, followed by the implementation of routine childhood immunization programs in Canada in the 1990s and screening during pregnancy have all contributed to decreasing rates of HBV  .\nSeveral seroprevalence surveys conducted before the availability of the HBV vaccine showed that HCWs had prevalence rates of past or present HBV infection that were three to fivefold higher than the general US population  ,\nIn addition to potential risk of occupational exposure, HCWs who have not been vaccinated or who are nonimmune following vaccination are subject to the same risk factors for HBV infection as the general population. The rates of HBsAg and anti-HBc positivity in HCWs worldwide published in several studies over the last three decades range from 0.1% to 8.1% and 6.2% to 73.4% respectively  . It is not known if the seroprevalence of HBV among Canadian HCWs is similar to that reported for the general public.\n\n【61】 #HBV Serologic Markers\nHBV is a DNA virus with a core protein surrounded by a coat containing surface antigen (HBsAg). The serologic markers of chronic HBV infection are varied and complex. Antigens and antibodies associated with HBV infection include HBsAg and antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs), antibody to HBcAg (anti-HBc), and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) and antibody to HBeAg (anti-HBe). At least one serologic marker is present during each of the different phases of HBV infection Some individuals infected with HBV carry a viral strain with a nucleotide substitution in the precore region of the viral genome. This mutation prevents transcription of the precore region and therefore, the release of HBeAg from the hepatocyte which results in a negative serum test for HBeAg.\nThe serologic markers currently used to identify a person's HBV status are HBsAg, anti-HBc IgG, and anti-HBs  . The only way to definitively differentiate acute from chronic infection is if HBsAg persists for more than 6 months HCWs infected with HBV have transmitted infection to patients while in the incubation period of infection, during acute hepatitis, a few months following acute hepatitis, and during the chronic phase of infection.\n\n【62】 #Estimated Risk of HBV Transmission\nHBV is highly infectious, can be transmitted in the absence of visible blood, and has been reported to remain infectious on environmental surfaces for at least 7 days  .\nIn a study involving 405 reported cases of acute HBV infection, 262 cases were interviewed for risk factors. A total of 1.9% reported percutaneous injury and 3.1% reported healthcareassociated risk factors  . In studies of HCWs who sustained injuries from needles contaminated with HBV, the risk of developing acute hepatitis if the blood was both HBsAg positive and HBeAg positive was 22-31%; and the risk for developing serologic evidence of HBV infection was 37-62%. By comparison, if the blood was HBsAg positive and HBeAg-negative, the risks decreased to 1-6% and 23-37% respectively  . It is reasonable to assume that the same risk for seroconversion, following patient exposure to an HBV-contaminated needle, apply to HBV transmission from HCWs to patients.\nResults from prospective studies showed that the estimated risk of transmission during exposure of two groups of 1,000 patients each to HBsAg positive HCWs and to HBsAg negative HCWs were both estimated to be less than 1%  . Transmission rates ranging from 0.06-11 This highlights the limitation of retrospective studies (triggered by reported transmission events) in obtaining data on transmission rates. When an infected patient is the trigger for an investigation seeking to identify other potentially exposed patients, the study design will result in documented transmission (the index patient)  . On the other hand, if an infected HCW is the trigger for an investigation (lookback), results will indicate either transmission or no transmission to patients.\nAlthough prospective studies provide an opportunity for appropriate controls, the infected HCWs' knowledge that they are being followed may influence them to follow more stringent precautions to prevent transmission  . Data informing the risk of transmission of HBV is mostly informed by published lookback investigations thus providing more incidents of transmission than no transmission of HBV.\nThe risk of infection was positively associated with the invasiveness of the procedures  .\nTo determine the observed rate of transmission of HBV from infected HCWs to patients in previous HBV exposure incidents, a meta-analysis of eligible exposure incidents was conducted . A total of 20 incidents were eligible for the meta-analysis including 3 with no transmission of HBV. The pooled transmission rate for HBV using the random effects DerSimonian-Laird model was 1.45% (95% CI: 0.601-2.658%). This corresponds to a chance of 1,450 per 100,000 individuals (95% CI: 601 to 2658 per 100,000 individuals) becoming infected in the absence of IPC breaches and illicit diversion of patient medication.\n\n【63】 #Review of Patient Exposure Incidents with Transmission of HBV\nSince the introduction of serologic testing in the 1970s, there have been over 45 reported incidents of HCW-to-patient transmission of HBV  . All levels of experience including trainees, clinical assistants and senior surgeons are represented; technical expertise or competence was not usually identified as a contributing factor in transmission incidents  . No dentist-to-patient transmission of HBV has been reported since the late 1980s. Two published incidents of HCWto-patient HBV transmission occurred in Canada\nA review of reported HCW-to-patient HBV transmission incidents in medical and dental settings, suggests that HCWs infected with HBV who are not involved in EPPs do not transmit infection unless there are IPC breaches  .\nA total of 35,665 patients were exposed to 21 HCWs infected with HBV from a variety of healthcare specialties The number of infected patients could be higher if one includes the additional 38 infected patients that were considered by the study authors to be probable or possible transmission from a HCW or were cases of undetermined origin where transmission during a procedure could not be ruled out.\n\n【64】 #Eight of the investigation reports did not address the hepatitis B (HB) immunization status of the\nHCWs who were infected. The remaining studies provided some information about whether the HCWs completed a full or partial vaccination series and whether they had documented serological confirmation of immune status as a result. Two HCWs had been vaccinated but most likely acquired their infection before vaccination. Of the incidents that reported immunization data, none of the infected HCWs implicated in transmission of HBV to their patients had completed a full HB vaccination series with documented serological confirmation of their immunity or there was inadequate investigation of nonresponder status after vaccination  . C Performed venepuncture, inserted intravenous lines and prepared and administered intravenous antibiotics. D HCW performed electroencephalograms with reusable needle electrodes.\nFor purposes of informing the systematic review question (What preventive or management measures can reduce the risk of transmission of HBV from infected HCWs to their patients?), data were extracted from all eligible epidemiologic investigations where HCW-to-patient transmission was reported. Twenty-eight such investigations were eligible for inclusion in the systematic review. Twenty-three of the 28 investigations involved an EPP EPP Yes\nThe Incident Investigation Teams and Others, 1997  5 23  Abbreviations: HBV, hepatitis B virus; EPP, exposure-prone procedure; IPC: infection prevention and control; PEP, post-exposure prophylaxis; NR, not reported; HCW, healthcare worker A N=28 for total number of infected HCWs from reported investigations.

L Response to HB vaccine not assessed post-vaccination for five HCWs  .\n\n【65】 #Review of Patient Exposure Incidents with No Transmission of HBV\nThere are very few reported HBV patient exposure incidents that describe a lack of transmission from the infected HCW. One study compared the risk factors for two infected surgeons, one who performed uncomplicated or low risk procedures and the other who performed higher risk procedures  .\nA second study was conducted prospectively to investigate possible transmission of HBV from nine infected HCWs to 246 patients  . Patients were exposed a total of 483 times and no transmission was documented. Two of the nine infected HCWs who were HBeAg positive and had circulating HBV DNA accounted for a total of two-thirds of patient contacts (1 dental technician, 1 ICU nurse and 1 medical student) over a 30-month period. The results of the study were pooled for all patients of all HCWs (n=246) and for all exposures (n=483) with no evidence of transmission identified  .\nFor purposes of informing the systematic review question (What preventive or management measures can reduce the risk of transmission of HBV from infected HCWs to their patients?), data were extracted from all eligible epidemiologic investigations where no transmission was reported.

K Diversion ruled out: Illicit diversion of patient medication by HCW was ruled out.\nRecommendations provided for minimizing risk of HCW-to-patient transmission of HBV have taken into consideration preventive measures and risk factors reported in exposure incidents to date.\n\n【66】 #HBV Viral Load\nThere was no clinical test for HBV viral load until the late 1990s. In general, the presence of eantigen is associated with high HBV viral load and was therefore used as a surrogate measure for infectivity in earlier recommendations  .\nSeveral lookback investigations predate the availability of viral load testing. Information on viral load provided in some lookback investigations is limited by the inability to link HCW viral load at time of transmission with rate of transmission. The viral load is usually tested weeks or months after transmission has occurred. This has led to concerns that data on HBV DNA levels to inform a cut-off level for HCWs who perform EPPs is not sufficiently robust  .\nThere are considerable differences in results obtained from various HBV DNA quantitative assays for individual sera  . In addition, various publications use slightly different conversion factors for the unit(s) used to report HBV DNA, largely based on the assay used. For purposes of this guideline, HBV DNA is expressed in terms of IU/mL as recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). The unit copies/mL is considered equivalent to genome equivalent (GE/mL) and one IU/mL is considered approximately equivalent to 5 GE/mL or copies/mL  .\nResults from transmission incidents indicate that risk of transmission was higher with HBV DNA levels above 1.8 x 10 5 IU/mL (10 6 GE/mL)  . Analysis of HBV DNA levels in surgeons who transmitted HBV to their patients helped identify an HBV DNA level above which transmission of HBV during an EPP could not be excluded. The identified HBV DNA level was 6 The study authors noted that assays for HBV DNA based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have a ½ log10 variance. In addition, fluctuations in HBV DNA levels up to 2 log10 have been reported in invidividuals infected with HBV who were HBeAg-negative and even higher fluctuations in individuals infected with HBV who are not on treatment. This necessitates allowing for in vitro variation in test results and in vivo fluctuations in HBV DNA levels (as demonstrated in HBeAg-negative individuals) before defining a cut-off HBV DNA level  .\nTreatment with current antivirals reduces HBV DNA levels to undetectable or almost undetectable levels in most persons ,105,268. Virtually all persons infected with HBV under treatment can expect reduction in HBV DNA viral loads within weeks or months of initiating therapy  . K Versant HBV bDNA 3.0 assay. L Detection assay based on TaqMan technology.\n\n【67】 #HBV Vaccination\nPrior to the introduction of a vaccine in the 1980s, HBV was a major occupational risk to HCW with exposure to blood, blood products, and other body fluids. HBV infection is currently preventable by vaccination, and Canada has had high risk and universal childhood HBV immunization programs in place, in all provinces and territories, since the mid-1990s  . A survey conducted over a decade after the introduction of vaccines showed that 90% of dentists in Canada had completed an immunization series and an additional 3% had natural immunity  .\nEvidence-based strategies to improve compliance with HB immunization recommendations in the Canadian Immunization Guide have been successful  . Although the success of HB vaccination programs is well documented among the younger population , there may be many HCWs who remain at risk of acquiring HBV. The risk of HBV transmission to a HCW who has been fully immunized and has developed an immune response after vaccination is virtually zero  .\nStrategies applied by a university postgraduate medical school to improve medical trainee compliance with immunization standards led to very high compliance with statistically significant increases in compliance over a 3-year period  . Canada's National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI), recommends immunization with HB vaccine and postimmunization serologic testing within 1 to 6 months of completion of the vaccine series for people who are at increased risk of infection through occupational exposure to blood, blood products and bodily fluids that may contain HBV  . This group includes all HCWs exposed to blood and other body fluids. Detailed recommendations on HB vaccination can be found in the Canadian Immunization Guide  .\nResponse to HB vaccine after a 3-dose series is generally greater than 95% in young healthy people  .\nOnce there is a record of a complete vaccination series and seroconversion has been documented for a HCW, i.e. anti-HBs titre ≥ 10 IU/L, he/she can be considered immune and no further testing is required, even if an exposure occurs. HCWs who have not responded to appropriate vaccination should be counseled on their ongoing risk of infection as well as the use of measures to reduce the risk of transmission. They should also be regularly assessed for infection (e.g. annually and after exposure)  .\nPeople who develop an anti-HBs titre of at least 10 IU/L (adequate anti-HBs titre) following the completion of a recommended vaccination schedule are considered protected for life  . Exceptions are some immunocompromised persons and people with chronic renal disease or on dialysis, who may require periodic booster doses if their anti-HBs titre falls below 10 IU/L. In immunocompetent individuals, although anti-HBs titres may become non-detectable over time, immune memory persists  . An assessment of evidence on long-term efficacy and effectiveness of HB vaccines in immunocompetent individuals, with particular focus on individuals immunized as infants and HCWs has been conducted  . - If an anti-HBs titre of at least 10 IU/L is confirmed B , testing need not be repeated nor should further immunization be undertaken, with the exception of immunocompromised persons who should be tested periodically for waning immunity, and persons with chronic renal disease or on dialysis, who should be tested yearly. - If testing for anti-HBs is done 1 to 6 months after vaccination and the anti-HBs titre is less than 10 IU/L B , a primary vaccine failure has occurred and the HCW should be given a second vaccine series. The HCW should be retested 1 to 6 months after completion of the second series.\n- If the HCW is tested more than 6 months after the initial series and the anti-HBs titre is less than 10 IU/L B , the cause may be either a primary vaccine failure or waning antibody. Evidence shows that, in immunocompetent people, immunity is long lasting although antibody may be non-detectable. The HCW should receive one booster dose and be retested one month later to document an anamnestic response (defined as anti-HBs titre ≥10 IU/L one to four weeks post booster vaccination). If the anti-HBs titre is still less than 10 IU/L B , the HCW should be tested for HBsAg and anti-HBc to rule out pre-existing chronic HBV infection. If both tests are negative, then a second vaccine series is indicated followed by anti-HBs serology 1 to 6 months after completing the second series B .\n- HCWs who have documented evidence of failure to respond to two series of HB vaccine (i.e. anti-HBs titre of less than 10 IU/L) are unlikely to benefit from further immunization and will need passive immunization after potential exposure to HB B, C . Occupational health or infectious disease specialists may be consulted regarding any new strategies that may be available such as intradermal vaccination or high potency vaccine.\n- If an HB exposure occurs, and a HCW has had a documented anti-HBs titre of at least 10 IU/L, no further testing is needed unless the HCW is immunocompromised or has chronic renal disease or is on dialysis. These HCWs should be tested for anti-HBs after a potential HB exposure and given additional vaccine and HBIg if their anti-HBs titre is less than 10 IU/L B .\nAbbreviations: HB, hepatitis B; anti-HBs, antibody to surface antigen; HBIg, hepatitis B immune globulin A Recommendations 3 (adapted) and 4 are excerpted from the Canadian Immunization Guide This statement was published prior to the development of the NACI methodology for grading of recommendations  . As a result, these recommendations are not graded.\nB Anti-HBs titre less than 10 IU/L is the international standard utilized by most laboratories but may vary by jurisdiction. Check with your local laboratory for the standard used locally. C The HCW should be referred to a specialist in immunization, B Ethical obligation may be traced to principles of non-maleficence (the duty to intentionally refrain from actions that cause harm), which includes an obligation for HCWs not to impose risks of harm to patients and creates a standard of due care 209 C Countries or areas with moderate to high risk of HBV are identified by the World Health Organization  , E HBV antiviral therapy may be required to allow HCWs infected with HBV to perform EPPs. F One IU/mL is considered equivalent to 5 copies/mL (i.e. 1 copy/mL is equivalent to 0.2 IU/mL)  . G Because the focus is on patient safety, HCWs who perform EPPs should be treated at this serum level regardless of recommendations in current treatment guidelines. With adherence to treatment as part of the threshold for infected HCWs to perform EPPs, HBV DNA levels are reduced to almost undetectable in most people. As a result, several known inconsistencies (e.g. differences in recommended HBV DNA threshold in various international guidelines, in-vivo fluctuations in a person's HBV DNA levels without treatment, variation in HBV DNA test results based on different assays used, or variations in results from repeated test of the same blood sample using the same assay) will likely have minimal impact on decisions regarding practice restrictions.\n\n【68】 #CO-INFECTION WITH BLOODBORNE VIRUSES\nDue to similar routes of infection, co-infection with any combination of HIV, HCV or HBV is not uncommon, especially among individuals with high risk of blood exposure such as hemophiliacs and people who use injection drugs ,32,184. A review of published literature on co-infection involving any two or all three of these BBVs was conducted in order to summarize considerations or challenges associated with management of HCWs with a BBV co-infection related to the risk of BBV transmission to patients.\nReports of co-infection with HIV-HBV and HBV-HCV are limited  .\nOverall, studies on BBV co-infection focus more on disease progression and prognosis and not much is reported on the effect of co-infection on infectivity or transmissibility of these viruses. Following the review of currently available publications on BBV co-infection, recommendations provided in this guideline for the management of individual BBVs were thought to be sufficient to prevent transmission from co-infected HCWs. This is because these recommendations primarily focus on treatment for the infections and setting viral load thresholds for safely performing EPPs. The effect of co-infection on disease progression and treatment is relevant primarily for the treating physician responsible for the clinical management of the infected HCW  .\nIf a HCW who performs EPPs is co-infected with any combination of these BBVs, the HCW should meet the defined criteria recommended for safe practice by HCWs infected with each virus  .\n\n【69】 #DOUBLE GLOVING\nSeveral studies investigating IPC practices of surgeons implicated in transmission of a BBV to patient(s) assessed the gloving practices of the infected HCW  as an effort to mitigate this risk has been well documented and is discussed below.\nMost relevant studies on gloving practices compared glove perforation rates by assessing for body fluid contact or leaks in gloves  .\nWhen two pairs of gloves are worn, the number of perforations to the inner glove and consequently potential HCW exposure to patient blood, is significantly reduced (70-87%) compared to when a single pair of gloves is used ,87,348. As a result, some literature and lookback investigations postulated that there would be a similar reduction in the risk of BBV transmission from HCW to patient, with double gloving more protective than a single pair of gloves  .\nA systematic review of RCTs investigated whether double gloving reduced the incidence of infections including surgical site infections, and bloodborne infections in surgical patients and in the surgical team  . The secondary study objective was to determine if additional glove protection reduced the number of perforations to the innermost pair of surgical gloves. Eligible RCTs involving two or more types of gloving including single gloving, double gloving, triple gloving, glove liners, knitted outer gloves, steel weave outer gloves, and perforation indicator systems were compared. A total of 61 RCTs informed the authors' conclusions on the various outcomes measured. A meta-analysis of 14 of these trials which included 8,885 surgeries, demonstrated that the addition of a second pair of gloves significantly reduced perforations to the innermost gloves (odds ratio 4.10, 95% confidence interval 3.30-5.09)  . Collectively, these studies may indicate that double gloving is indeed important for procedures with high risk of glove perforations and may therefore be a relevant preventive measure for transmission of bloodborne infections.\nDeterrents against the wide adoption of double gloving by HCWs who perform EPPs include the need to change a habit, decreased manual dexterity and tactile sensation, constriction of the hands and digits leading to discomfort, paucity of evidence, and low perceived personal risk by HCWs ,20,349,350,353. In many cases, a period of adaptation and \"retraining\" seems to be required before practitioners feel comfortable with double gloving  . As a result, it is not possible to conclusively state that double gloving is a critical element for preventing transmission of BBVs between HCWs and patients.\nDouble gloving by HCWs, to protect themselves and their patients, may best be addressed as a matter of preference until further studies are conducted. Factors to consider in making a decision whether or not to double glove based on identified risk factors for glove perforations are summarized below  :\n- The addition of a second pair of surgical gloves significantly reduces perforations to innermost gloves  .\n- Wearing two pairs of gloves does not substantially impact tactile sensitivity or manual dexterity to the point of resulting in more perforations  .\n- Risk of glove perforation has been reported to increase with the length and complexity of the procedure as well as HCW expertise and risk of injury associated with the procedure  .\n- If double gloving, wearing glove perforation indicator systems results in significantly more inner glove perforations being detected during surgery than when wearing standard double latex gloves  .\n- If HCWs choose to double glove, they should do so routinely and not based on the risk status of a patient. Occasional double gloving would not provide the opportunity for the HCW to adapt to it thereby potentially posing a risk to both the HCW and the patient  .\n\n【70】 #Recommendation for Double Gloving for Infected Healthcare Workers\nRecommendation 1. There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against double gloving to prevent HCW-to-patient transmission of a BBV. Grade of evidence: Not applicable due to insufficient data specific to BBV transmission\n\n【71】 #Reporting Obligations\nIn all provinces and territories, certain HCWs are obligated by law to report patients infected with specified communicable diseases including HIV, HBV and HCV to public health  . There may be additional ethical, legal or regulatory reporting requirements related to patients infected with a BBV, who are also HCWs. As a result, all treating clinicians should be familiar with the reporting obligations in effect within their province or territory of practice  .\n\n【72】 #Expert Review Panels\nWithin the context of this guideline, Expert Review Panels (ERPs) are advisory committees to the relevant jurisdictional authority (e.g. public health, regulatory authority) whose primary role is to assess the risk of transmission of a BBV from an infected HCW to patients and assess whether practice modifications or restrictions are needed if the infected HCW performs EPPs.\nA review of existing guidelines from Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, Europe, France, Ireland, Australia, and the Netherlands shows differences in approach to convening and/or implementing an expert review process  .\n\n【73】 #Canadian Approach\nThe approach taken for the establishment of ERPs in Canada varies across provinces and territories (P/Ts) ERPs have been convened by P/T ministries of health or public health agencies, as well as by university faculties (e.g. medicine) or regulatory authorities for HCW professional groups ,274. Health Canada's 1998 consensus document recommended the creation of an ERP  . At the time of developing this guideline, not all HCWs infected with a BBV in Canada had access to an ERP. Where ERPs exist, the process for implementation and monitoring for compliance with recommendations provided by the panel also varies across P/Ts. The inconsistencies in establishing an ERP and developing a framework for their decision-making have led to inconsistent practices across Canada. This could result in movement of an infected HCW between provinces and territories, a situation where an infected HCW is not being managed, or management of an infected HCW using advice that is not based on available evidence regarding risk of transmission. A consistent evidence-based approach across the country will improve patient safety and support the effective and equal treatment of HCWs infected with a BBV irrespective of where they work in Canada. This guideline is intended to support consistency in availability of ERPs and their practices nationally.\nFor purposes of developing this guideline, an environmental scan of relevant literature was conducted to address the key question, What issues are relevant to the expert review process in Canada for the management of HCWs infected with HIV / HCV / HBV? Characteristics of ERPs in Canada were identified through an environmental scan of publicly available documents and personal communication where necessary. Upon review of relevant documents, current practice, and stakeholder engagement, essential components were identified to inform recommendations for establishment of effective ERPs by provincial and territorial health authorities. These recommendations prioritize patient safety using a consistent and evidence-based approach to decision-making regarding the management of infected HCWs while ensuring that each HCW's right to privacy and the confidentiality of their personal medical information are maintained.\n\n【74】 #Recommendations for Expert Review Panels\nRecommendations for the governance, authority, responsibility and processes for ERPs are provided below. These issues should be clearly defined for each P/T such that all HCWs (including students) who may be affected by the policies are afforded the opportunity to receive expert guidance related to their BBV infection. o The composition of the panel and who it reports to should be publicly available. - P/Ts and regulatory authorities without the necessary resources and expertise to establish an ERP, should partner with another P/T to ensure that all HCWs infected with a BBV have access to an ERP.\n- Expert Review Panels should engage relevant stakeholders such as public health, health faculties and healthcare institutions.\n- Indemnification should be provided for all ERP members.\n- The ERP should be adequately resourced to complete its mandate. The governing authority for an ERP is responsible for addressing the remuneration of the ERP members.\n- The ERP should be convened in a timely manner when an infected HCW is identified for review.\n- There should be sufficient members on the ERP to provide the breadth of expertise required to assess the risk posed by a HCW infected with a BBV, and offer recommendations to mitigate the risk. Membership on an ERP should include an infectious disease physician and a public health professional. Other members may include: a hepatologist, surgeon, medical/clinical microbiologist, infection prevention and control professional, occupational health physician, bioethicist, member of the public, and peer HCW (in the same area of practice as the HCW infected with a BBV).\n\n【75】 #Roles and Responsibilities\n- An ERP should assess the risk that the HCW may pose to patients and make recommendations on fitness for practice based on the HCWs' health status and practice. - The HCW or their delegate should have an opportunity to present information during the assessment for fitness to practice.\n- The HCW or their delegate should have an opportunity to discuss the recommendations prior to implementation and have an opportunity for clarification or a re-evaluation.\n- The ERP or regulatory authority should sign a written agreement with the HCW that identifies the recommendations and specifies any practice modifications or restrictions, with whom the agreement will be shared with (regulatory authority, program director, etc.), who will be monitoring the HCW's compliance, and who will be responsible for monitoring the HCW's health status. Ensuring that the HCW is under the care of a clinician with expertise in management of the BBV(s) is an important aspect of care for the HCW; this care provider may have an ongoing role in receiving test results and communicating status updates with the regulatory authority at defined intervals.\n- Recommendations of the ERP including the signed agreement should be in the possession of the regulatory authority that is responsible for monitoring the HCW's compliance with the recommendations.\n- The relevant authority should have a process in place in the event a HCW wishes to request a re-evaluation of any ERP recommendation(s). Acceptable reasons for a reevaluation should be outlined and may include concerns with the process, availability of new treatment regimens, or new information about the HCW's health status or practice.\n\n【76】 #Referral to an ERP\nThere are several mechanisms for initiating a referral to an ERP. The options provided here are not exhaustive.\n\n【77】 - The referral to the ERP may be initiated by the Medical Officer of Health or the regulatory authority; with appropriate information communicated in writing, in person, or by phone. If initiated by the regulatory authority, their monitoring department may send a list of HCWs infected with BBVs to an ERP for review. - The referral to the ERP may be initiated by the HCW and done via telephone contact to maintain anonymity. Alternatively, the HCW may choose to initiate the referral via an advocate, surrogate, or legal representative. Most often the advocate is the treating physician.\n- In the case of students and trainees, the referral may be initiated through the undergraduate or post-graduate office of the faculty.\n\n【78】 #Implementation, Monitoring and Compliance with ERP Recommendations\n- The ERP should provide recommendations informed by Sections 6.6, 7.6 and 8.9\nRecommendations for Management of HCWs infected with HIV, HCV and HBV respectively. - The HCW and treating clinician should provide the relevant authority with the necessary information to confirm compliance with the recommendations.\n- The relevant regulatory authority may remove the HCW's licence if the HCW is noncompliant with practice restrictions. - In the event that a HCW who is being monitored changes jurisdictions or institutions, the regulatory authority or faculty should inform the appropriate jurisdictional authorities subject to applicable laws.\nAlthough local jurisdictions can adapt the referral and implementation processes within the context of the relevant authorities and available resources, specific guidelines and recommendations are provided above for each key step\nPolicies regarding the management of HCWs infected with BBVs must comply, as appropriate, with applicable jurisdictional health and privacy legislation, employment law, Human Rights codes and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\nAbbreviations: HCW, healthcare worker; BBV, bloodborne virus; EPPs, exposure-prone procedures; IPC, infection prevention and control; ERP, Expert Review Panel; P/T, provincial and territorial Regulated HCW infected with a BBV  Regulated HCW infected with a BBV  Yes No HCW consults with relevant authority  HCW consults with relevant authority  Does the HCW perform or wish to perform EPPs  ?\nDoes the HCW perform or wish to perform EPPs  ?\nRestrictions on practice not needed based on BBV status alone Restrictions on practice not needed based on BBV status alone HCW notifies regulatory authority  HCW notifies regulatory authority  Relevant authority ensures review of HCW's general practice (including IPC) by an individual with the appropriate expertise  Relevant authority ensures review of HCW's general practice (including IPC) by an individual with the appropriate expertise\n\n【79】 #E p R w P ERP\nR n 11 0 PC M g m d HCW d o mm d n E HCW h h d u n u u p b A k p d o p h o h du h HCW p o m w d k p o m M mm d h h HCW m mp w h d d p d R g mm d b d w m b HCW h h d p C mm n d d w h h h R p p d qu m d p g S d po o g g u h y R gu y ho y d n E u w o HCW PC p by n nd d w h h pp op p b E o p n Ob w g m w h h HCW\nx ert evie anel   Expert Review Panel (ERP)  efer to sectio .\nvaluates 's ealt status an c rre t or f t re ractice a.

This model could be adapted to align with jurisdictional requirements and for unregulated HCWs, including students in some P/Ts, to ensure that all infected HCWs have access to the appropriate expertise in a timely manner. The process includes assessment for risk of transmission of the BBV during the provision of care; the provision of recommendations to the HCW, including practice restrictions if applicable; and the monitoring of the HCW's compliance with the recommendations.\nFor example, regulatory authority, public health.\n- An individual with the appropriate expertise may vary depending on the types of procedures performed by the infected HCW. At a minimum, the review should include all the elements of Routine Practices for the prevention of transmission of infections in healthcare settings (i.e. hand hygiene, aseptic technique, sharps safety and prevention of exposure to BBVs, etc.). If a HCW should want to start performing EPPs, they will need to notify their regulatory authority again. 4. Question to be answered by the relevant authority (e.g. regulatory authority, public health). Other reasons for referral to an ERP may include: Confirmed HCW-to-patient transmission of a BBV; and presence of extenuating circumstances that may increase risk of exposure to patients (e.g. identified IPC breaches).\nThe regulatory authority can be notified from other sources as well (e.g. a peer HCW, a Medical Officer of Health, a diagnosing or treating physician). 6. The Chair of the ERP may work with the regulatory authority to determine the need for practice restrictions and subsequent referral to the ERP. 7. Communication or notification beyond the source of referral should only be done with the consent of the infected HCW and subject to applicable laws. 8. May include communicating with or reporting to the faculty program director, P/T public health and/or the HCW's employer.\n\n【81】 #DISCLOSURE OBLIGATIONS AND RIGHT TO PRIVACY\nFew Canadian guidelines and policies address the issue of disclosure obligations to patients. None of those reviewed regard routine disclosure of HCW serologic status to patients as a necessary requirement for the provision of care. When a HCW infected with a BBV has been reviewed by an ERP and deemed safe to practice, the issue of disclosure is not applicable.\n\n【82】 #International Approach\nThe United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) previously required that HCWs infected with HBV or HIV who perform EPPs disclose their serologic status to their patients  . However, this is no longer a requirement in the CDC's updated recommendations for the management of HCWs infected with HBV  . These recommendations state that routine mandatory disclosure might be counterproductive to public health, as it might lead to avoidance of testing, vaccination, treatment and/or management, and may result in non-compliance with practice oversight from an ERP. The risk of transmission of a BBV is greater from unknown infections than from known infections. Mandatory disclosure was \"accepted to be an insurmountable barrier to practice, and might limit patient and community access to quality medical care\"  .\nInternationally, none of the reviewed policy documents regard disclosure of a HCW's serologic status to patients as a necessary requirement for the provision of care  . The HCW right to privacy is comprehensively addressed, but the practical steps to ensure that this right is upheld are not included in most policies.\nA harmonized, evidence-based approach to addressing HCW disclosure obligations and right to privacy is warranted, and stands to benefit HCWs, patients, and society. Ensuring safe medical care and protecting HCW privacy rights should be achieved in a consistent and transparent manner in all healthcare settings across Canada0 Infection Prevention and Control Management of Infected Healthcare Workers  . This obligation of HCWs in Canada, whether ethical or professional, is increasingly recognized. Concurrently, policies are being developed to address issues related to HCW rights to privacy, and attenuate risks to patients in healthcare settings. This trend does not, however, extend to a disclosure obligation of serologic status from HCW to patient.\n\n【83】 #Disclosure Obligations\nMany of the current guidelines and policies that address HCWs and BBV infections do not contain explicit recommendations regarding disclosure obligations of HCWs to patients. None of the reviewed guidelines and policies recommends mandatory routine disclosure of HCW serologic status to patients, regardless of whether or not the HCW performs EPPs ,13,54,71,274,377.\nSome publications suggest that mandatory disclosure of a HCW's serologic status to patients be restricted to cases arising when:  exposure from a HCW infected with a BBV to a patient has occurred;\nthe HCW has been non-compliant with an ERP's recommendations or  viral load in the infected HCW constitutes a material risk to the patient. If the ERP has deemed the HCW safe to practice, this negates both material risk and a need for disclosure.\n\n【84】 #Right to Privacy\nThe right to privacy of a HCW infected with a BBV is addressed in most relevant Canadian and international guidelines and policies. While the wording to describe this right varies, the guidelines and policies uniformly recognize the importance of maintaining HCW privacy without specifying mechanisms to achieve this.\n\n【85】 #Ethical Aspects\nThere is an inherent ethical dilemma in considering disclosure. The risk of transmission of a BBV from HCW to patient is non-zero (i.e. the risk exists, even if minimal). Therefore patients have an interest in knowing about the risk, while HCWs have an interest in protecting their privacy; given the impact that disclosing to patients might have on their practice and personal lives.\nEthically, the interests of the patient and HCW must also be balanced against other competing rights and interests which, in this case, may include denying patients the services of HCWs without improving the safety of care, creating unfair hardship for HCWs, and creating an economic burden on the health system.\n0 Infection Prevention and Control Management of Infected Healthcare Workers. These obligations may be traced to principles of non-maleficence (the duty to intentionally refrain from actions that cause harm), respect for autonomy (the responsibility to obtain informed consent from patients for treatment, and provide all information material to their decision making), and the right to privacy (the obligation to minimize the extent to which HCWs may experience stigmatization, discrimination and/or reduced professional prospects as a result of disclosing their serologic status)  . It is expected that HCWs follow all the elements of code of practice of which informed consent and fitness to practice are included.\n\n【86】 #Legal Context\nIn accordance with the Canadian legal system, policies regarding the management of HCWs infected with BBVs must comply, as appropriate, with applicable jurisdictional health and privacy legislation, employment law, Human Rights codes and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  . Provincial Human Rights codes prohibit discrimination on several grounds, including \"disability\", a term that, under antidiscrimination law in Canada, includes infection with HBV, HIV and/or HCV.\nIn all provinces and territories in Canada, HIV (or AIDS), HBV and HCV are reportable diseases under public health legislation  . It has not been established, however, whether an obligation to disclose serologic status to patients exists under common law. Such an obligation would likely infringe upon the HCWs' rights to privacy and freedom from discrimination under the Charter and Human Rights codes. When such conflicts arise between the Charter, Human Rights Codes and common law, the courts recognize that rights are non-absolute and have limits, and evaluate the case on consideration of matters such as the balance between the provision of safe health care to patients and respect for the rights of HCWs  . Fiduciary duties may require HCWs to disclose their serologic status when performing EPPs. However, if the HCW takes reasonable steps to reduce the risk of transmission to acceptable levels, fiduciary duty obligations may be satisfied without having to disclose serologic status  .\nA HCW infected with HBV, HCV and/or HIV could in theory face legal liability for failure to obtain informed consent if the HCW does not disclose their serologic status. To give informed consent, a patient must be provided with all information material to the proposed treatment plan, including all 'material, and special or unusual risks'  . It has been suggested that the disclosure obligations may be better managed by regulatory authorities.\nIt is possible the courts may also take into account the public policy consequences of disclosure, and the special nature of the relationship between HCWs and patients, in determining whether and to what extent an obligation exists  .\nThe following recommendations are based on a review of existing Canadian and international guidelines and policies, taking into consideration the ethical and legal contexts.\n12.6 Recommendations for HCW Disclosure Obligations and Right to Privacy Recommendations 1. A HCW infected with a BBV who performs EPPs does not have an obligation to routinely disclose his or her serologic status to patients to obtain their informed consent provided that the HCW's health status and practice have been assessed by an Expert Review Panel and all the panel's recommendations are followed.\n- All HCWs, including those infected with a BBV, have a right to privacy and confidentiality of personal health information.\n\n【87】 - When a patient has been exposed to the blood of a HCW, the HCW must seek follow-up through their organizational process and the patient must be promptly informed of the nature of the exposure and the appropriate post-exposure protocol. However, the identity and confidentiality of the HCW should be protected to the greatest extent possible.\n\n【88】 #Overview of Lookback Investigations\n\n【89】 Complete reports on lookback investigations are rarely published in peer-reviewed journals  .\nThere have been five Canadian lookback investigations involving infected HCWs published to date. These involved two HCWs infected with HBV\nSeveral countries have national regulations and/or policies that frame and guide decisions and risk assessments surrounding lookback investigations  .\nHealthcare organizations have an obligation to inform patients of an exposure incident where there is a risk of transmission of a BBV  .\nA HCW's right to privacy and confidentiality of his or her personal health information must be respected during a lookback investigation  . It is feasible to conduct the investigation and publish a report without infringing on the rights of the affected HCW  . Abbreviations: LB, lookback investigation; HCW, healthcare worker; EPP, exposure-prone procedure; HBV, hepatitis B virus; NR, not reported; IPC, infection prevention and control; HCV, hepatitis C virus; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus A Articles that provide supplementary information about the specific epidemiologic investigation included in the systematic review B In addition to patients identified prior to the lookback investigation. C The report states that approximately 40 full-time equivalent positions were required in the first week alone. In addition, external expertise was obtained from the provincial ministry of health, public health, medical regulatory authority, legal counsel, and a communications consultant. D A phased approach by greatest risk of transmission and exposure was used. The parameters for the screening period were determined based on the HCW's abnormal laboratory findings and HCV mutation over time. E As there was no transmission identified in the first phase, the investigators decided not to pursue screening of patients with a lower risk of exposure thus permitting an efficient use of public health resources.\n\n【90】 #Key Considerations and Objectives of a Lookback Investigation\nLookback investigations require resources to identify, notify, counsel and test all the potentially exposed patients  . These investigations often involve collaboration between a healthcare organization or facility where an infected HCW practiced and public health authorities. Although such collaborations may potentially pose a challenge for conducting the investigation, the process is generally coordinated by an Investigation Management Team with the expertise needed to successfully and efficiently manage the investigation  .\nLookback investigations are both time consuming and costly activities requiring significant financial and human resources  . Direct and indirect costs are associated with salaries for personnel, honoraria for expert advice, counseling and testing of patients, courier services and support services such as information technology, telephone services, security, and media relations. These resources can come at the expense of other institutional or public health activities  . One report stated that the cost of a lookback investigation was equivalent to a third of the state's entire annual budget for HIV and AIDS surveillance (excluding the costs to other organizations involved in the investigation)  . Investigations conducted in the early 1990s cost over US $100,000  , or the lack of computerized information systems to assist with information retrieval, can also hinder an investigation.\n\n【91】 #Recommendations for Conducting Lookback Investigations\n\n【92】 Prior to initiating a lookback investigation, a risk assessment is conducted by a team with the expertise needed to determine the requirement for an investigation and if applicable, define its scope. Recommendations for conducting the risk assessment are provided below including supporting tools to facilitate decision making.\n\n【93】 #Risk assessment to determine requirement for a lookback investigation\n- If a HCW who performs EPPs is found to be infected with a BBV, a team should be assembled to perform a risk assessment. Some organizations may have a standing risk assessment panel or process that could be utilized. - The HCW should cease performing EPPs immediately and be referred to an ERP for practice evaluation while the risk assessment is underway.\n- Although there is a necessary link between the tasks done by both groups, the team responsible for performing the risk assessment should be different from the Expert Review Panel (ERP).\n- Members of the risk assessment team should be familiar with the legal obligations in effect within their jurisdiction that may impact the decision-making process related to lookback investigations.\n- The risk assessment team should include individuals with sufficient expertise to assess both the risk of potential exposure and transmission and to identify the process required to address these risks (e.g. infectious disease physician with expertise in relevant BBV, infection control professional, public health physician, peer HCW, medical microbiologist, bioethics expert, facility senior management, and legal counsel).\n- Processes should be in place to ensure there is no conflict of interest or bias with regards to conducting the lookback investigation.\n- For a consistent and thorough approach to risk assessment, pre-developed tools should be used to perform the assessment,\n- An algorithm and legend for guidance on the risk assessment . 12 Has the HCW's practice ever been reviewed by an ERP? Note: If yes, identify the ERP recommendations and whether the HCW was compliant with them.\n\n【94】 #Questions to consider related to extenuating circumstances\n13 Has the HCW complied with current infection prevention and control standards (i.e. Routine Practices)?\n14 Does the HCW use technique(s) (e.g. surgical) that may increase his/her risk of percutaneous injuries during procedures that can put patients at risk of exposure to the HCW's blood?\n15 Has the HCW had percutaneous injuries that exposed a patient to the HCW's blood (both reported and unreported)?\n16 Has the HCW ever noted blood on his/her hands after removal of surgical gloves following procedures performed on patients?\n17 Has the HCW ever had evidence of a skin condition on his/her hands that potentially created an exit portal for BBVs (e.g. dermatitis)?\nAbbreviations: HCW, healthcare worker; BBV, bloodborne virus; ERP, Expert Review Panel; EPP, exposure-prone procedure A Adapted from UKAP  enquiry pro forma  .\nWere modifications in HCW practice recommended?  LB is not required based on risk of transmission of BBV  Abbreviations: HCW, healthcare worker; BBV, bloodborne virus; LB, lookback investigation; EPP, exposureprone procedure; ERP, Expert Review Panel; IPC, infection prevention and control\n\n【95】 #Yes\nIdentification of a HCW infected with a BBV may trigger a risk assessment to determine if a lookback investigation is required. In addition, the HCW should be referred to an ERP as soon as possible to have their health status and practice reviewed (if not previously done). 2. As determined by a traceback investigation\nExtenuating circumstances include IPC breaches by the HCW that put patients at risk of exposure during the provision of care or illicit diversion of patient medication. 4 50 Exposure-prone procedures. 6. A lookback investigation may not be required based solely on risk of transmission of BBV however, a risk assessment team may determine that a lookback investigation is necessary based on other considerations (e.g. contribute to evidence base, alleviate public anxiety). 7. HCW who, at the time of potential patient exposure, had: i HBV viral load greater or equal to 10 3 IU/ml (5x10 3 GE/ml); ii detectable HIV viremia; or iii circulating HCV RNA. 8. The risk assessment team should determine the need for a LB on a case-by-case basis considering all relevant information. 9,0 Risk of Transmission for HIV, 7.0 Risk of Transmission for HCV, 8.0 Risk of Transmission for HBV and 11.2 Expert Review Panels. 102 Expert Review Panels. 11. Although the risk of transmission is not zero, it can be rendered negligible if HCWs infected with a BBV who perform EPPs adhere to recommendations which have addressed the identified risk factors from previous exposure incidents.\n\n【96】 #Lookback investigation: scope, roles and functions\n- A LB investigation management team with an identified lead should be assembled to coordinate the investigation. This may be the same group as the risk assessment team.\n- The investigation management team should include individuals with expertise in infectious disease, infection prevention and control, public health, medical microbiology, bioethics, laboratory services, the relevant BBV and the types of procedures performed by the infected HCW. In addition, representatives from the facility's senior management, communications department, risk management, and legal counsel should be included. Members of the investigation management team should be familiar with the legal obligations in effect within their jurisdiction that may impact the decision-making process related to lookback investigations.\n- Members of the investigation management team should sign a pledge of confidentiality.\n- The lookback investigation should be undertaken in a reasonable amount of time.\n\n【97】 #Access to resources\n- Lookback investigations can be resource intensive and impact on laboratory resources should be considered. The public health laboratory should be involved with the investigation, whenever possible, to ensure appropriate testing, reporting and accountability.\n- Detailed molecular analysis of samples in the investigation should be done to confirm or exclude HCW-to-patient transmission.\n- Members of the risk assessment and investigation management teams should have access to appropriate patient information to support the decision-making process as per relevant provincial and territorial legislation.\n- Provincial or territorial public health authorities may request the assistance of their federal counterparts.\n\n【98】 #Risk communications\n- A well-developed and coordinated communication strategy should be in place prior to patient notification. o Consideration should be given to setting up a call centre with a telephone hotline for public inquiries with personnel trained to provide accurate information while managing the anxiety that may be generated. o A list of potentially exposed patients to be notified should be assembled such that all patients are notified simultaneously and prior to public announcements. o All information necessary to inform the advice and counselling provided to potentially exposed individuals and their families should be compiled prior to patient notification. o All reasonable steps should be taken to identify and contact potentially exposed patients and encourage them to be tested for their own benefit. o Communication via traditional news media (press releases and conferences) as well as use of social media should be well coordinated. o Communication strategies should consider the following stakeholders: facility or organization personnel, the media, healthcare providers in the community, political representatives of the district and the general public. - Reports on lookback investigations should be published to contribute to the evidence base on risk of transmission from HCW to patients, inform future policy development, estimate cost associated with these investigations and improve patient safety.\n- A national repository to document all lookback investigations, including those where no transmission was found, should be created.\n\n【99】 #HCW confidentiality and right to privacy A\n- Every effort should be made to avoid revealing the identity or information that would allow deductive disclosure of the HCW infected with a BBV. However, there may be instances where patient safety precludes this.\n- Members of the investigation management team have an obligation to keep the information they receive confidential and respect the HCW's right to privacy.\n- The right to privacy still applies if the infected HCW has died, or has already been identified publicly.\n- The number of individuals who know the identity of the infected HCW should be kept to a minimum at all stages. It may not be necessary for all members of the team(s) to be aware of the identity of the infected HCW. G Articles identified as companion articles provide supplementary information about the specific epidemiologic investigation included in the systematic review\nH Total number of patients tested consisted of: 519 patients initially tested (which identified the second and third cases); plus three patients later tested (who were identified by cross-matching the patient list with the state's AIDS surveillance records, self-identification, and routine testing for application to the military); plus an additional 141 patients tested with no evidence of transmission amongst them  UK C Indicates whether the HCW was symptomatic at any point during the screening period. Where the article described the HCW's clinical symptoms but did not clearly state that they were linked to the HIV infection, experts reviewed the information provided to determine whether the HCW's symptoms were compatible with an HIV infection. If so, a response of \"Compatible with HIV\" was recorded. D Indicates whether the HCW was aware of their HIV-positive serologic status at any time during the screening period. If the article stated that the HCW was aware of their serologic status but it was unclear when they became aware of it, a response of \"NR\" was recorded. E Indicates whether IPC breaches were identified. A response of \"Yes\" may also indicate any of the following: 1 there was a lack of adherence to standard IPC practices and protocols; or 2 the Guideline Development Task Group determined that by current standards, an IPC breach was present. A response of \"No\" indicates that an independent review of the HCW's practice was undertaken with no IPC breaches noted. F Article met the eligibility criteria for data extraction to inform the systematic review on the risk for transmission of HIV from infected HCWs to patients. G The severe dermatitis on the HCW's hands contributed to the decision to investigate potential transmission of HIV to his patients. H Articles identified as companion articles provide supplementary information about the specific epidemiologic investigation included in the systematic review\nI HCW with HIV-HBV co-infection. J Article reported on this HCW risk factor but did not report on the screening period. As a result, it is unclear if the HCW risk factor existed during the time span selected for screening potentially exposed patients In the UK, HCWs infected with HIV were restricted from performing any exposure-prone procedures until 2014  . O The infected HCW's specialty is not described however it is reported that his atopic eczema prevented him from wearing gloves systematically. Based on this information, it was determined that cardiothoracic surgery was not the procedure where transmission occurred. Note that several HCWs were tested including a surgeon, 4 nurses, 2 cardiopulmonary bypass technicians, 2 surgical assistants and 4 anesthesiologists. P HCW was diagnosed as HCV positive in 2006 but had a subsequent negative PCR result. In 2010, the HCW's viral load was 2.4 x 10 6 IU/mL. Q Four of the 48 potentially exposed patients were known to be infected with HCV B Screening period: Time span selected by the investigators to screen patients. C HCW risk factors reported to be present at any point during the screening period. D Article met the eligibility criteria for data extraction to inform the systematic review on the risk for transmission of HCV from infected HCWs to patients. E Although diagnosed in 2003, a stored sample of blood from April 1991, when the HCW was first denied for blood donation, was seropositive for HCV. F Indicates whether the HCW was symptomatic at any point during the screening period. Where the article described the HCW's clinical symptoms but did not clearly state that they were linked to the HCV infection, experts reviewed the information provided to determine whether the HCW's symptoms were compatible with an HCV infection. If so, a response of 'Compatible with HCV' was recorded. G Indicates whether the HCW was aware of their HCV-positive serologic status at any point during the screening period. If the article stated that the HCW was aware of their serologic status but it was unclear when they became aware of it, a response of 'NR' was recorded.\nH Indicates whether IPC breaches were identified. A response of 'Yes' may also indicate any of the following: 1 there was a lack of adherence to standard IPC practices and protocols; or 2 the Guideline Development Team and/or the Task Group determined that by current standards, an IPC breach was present. A response of 'No' indicates that an independent review of the HCW's practice was undertaken with no IPC breaches noted. I IPC breaches were reported during the research project which led to transmission however there was no report of IPC breach related to the HCW's practice during patient care In the United Kingdom, HCV RNA positive HCWs are restricted from performing exposure-prone procedures unless they have been successfully treated  . Since 2005, if no evidence of transmission of HCV or other risk factor increasing risk of transmission from a HCW infected with HCW is present, the UKAP does not recommend that patients be notified or tested  .\nK Staged lookback investigations related to the practices of 5 infected HCWs were recommended by the UKAP. These involved the last 500 patients who had undergone higher risk exposure-prone procedures. One of the investigations identified infected patients after the 2004 report was published.\nL Companion articles provide supplementary information about the specific epidemiologic investigation M Information obtained from Charles et al, In October 2005, the HCW was being investigated for 'unspecified ill health' and stopped work immediately.

G Article met the eligibility criteria for data extraction to inform the systematic review of HBV exposure incidents with HCW to patient transmission. H Confirmed cases are: 1 Patients with a temporally-related active HBV infection that is genetically linked to the HBV-infected HCW; or 2 Patients with a serologic evidence of a previous infection consistent with timing of exposure or evidence of pre-exposure seronegative status; or 3 Reported as confirmed transmission cases by the authors.\nI Undetermined cases: 1 Reported as undetermined by the authors; 2 serologic evidence of a previous infection with no evidence of pre-exposure seronegative status or no lifetime risk factors; or 3 no lookback investigation for sub-clinical infection was performed. J Indicates whether the HCW was symptomatic at any point during the screening period. Where the article described the HCW's clinical symptoms but did not clearly state that they were linked to the HBV infection, experts reviewed the information provided to determine whether the HCW's symptoms were compatible with an HBV infection. If so, a response of \"Compatible with HBV\" was recorded. K Indicates whether the HCW was aware of their HBV-positive serologic status at any time during the screening period. If the article stated that the HCW was aware of their serologic status but it was unclear when they became aware of it, a response of \"Not reported\" (NR) was recorded. L Indicates whether IPC breaches were identified. A response of 'Yes' may also indicate any of the following: 1 there was a lack of adherence to standard IPC practices and protocols; or 2 the Guideline Development Team and/or the Task Group determined that by current standards, an IPC breach was present. A response of 'No' indicates that an independent review of the HCW's practice was undertaken with no IPC breaches noted. M Articles identified as companion articles provide supplementary information about the specific epidemiologic investigation included in the systematic review N Includes the cases related to both clusters but excludes one case of secondary transmission identified in the first cluster. O Number applies to investigation of second cluster only. P The HCW was linked to both the first and second cluster when it was determined (during the second investigation) that the HCW had provided a blood sample taken from another person during the investigation for the first cluster.

It may also be seen in chronic infection during flares of activity, so clinical / epidemiological correlation is required for interpretation  .\n\n【129】 #Anti-HBc IgG\nAnti-HBc IgG appears shortly after infection and usually persists for life in the majority of persons, sometimes showing up as the antibodies to all other proteins fade  .\n\n【130】 #HBeAg\nThis is a secreted product of the nucleocapsid gene of HBV that is found in the serum during acute and chronic HBV infection  . It is a marker of active viral replication and its presence indicates high infectivity  . Some individuals infected with HBV, carry a viral strain with a nucleotide substitution in the precore region of the viral genome. This mutation prevents transcription of the precore region and therefore, the release of HBeAg from the hepatocyte which results in a negative serum test for HBeAg. This mutation is important because infections caused by these viruses are difficult to treat, can cause prolonged infections, and are associated with a higher risk of liver cirrhosis.\n\n【131】 #Anti-HBe\nAppears with recovery from acute infection, but may disappear over time. In chronic infection, the presence of anti-HBe is generally a marker of reduced viral replication, indicating a less infectious state  . For individuals carrying the viral strain with a mutation preventing transcription of the precore region and therefore, the release of HBeAg from the hepatocyte, this allows anti-HBe to be detected but HBV DNA is still high.\n\n【132】 #HBV DNA\nUsed to measure level of infectivity and response to treatment  .

Evidence on its efficacy is limited in quantity and quality. Therefore, this procedure should only be used with special arrangements for clinical governance, consent and local audit, and with submission of data to a register .\nClinicians wishing to undertake electrochemotherapy for treating primary BCC and primary SCC should take the following actions:\nInform the clinical governance leads in their NHS trusts.\nEnsure that patients understand the uncertainty about the procedure's efficacy and why it is being offered as an alternative to other established methods of treatment, and provide them with clear written information. In addition, the use of NICE's information for the public is recommended.\nPatient selection should be carried out by a specialist skin cancer multidisciplinary team. Patient selection is particularly important because the cure rates for established treatments in accessible sites are very high. Careful consideration should be given to the reasons for offering electrochemotherapy, especially in the context of treating primary BCC and SCC with curative intent.\nThis procedure should only be carried out by clinicians with specific training in the technique.\nEntry into research trials should also be considered, with a view to providing data about cure and about recurrence rates, compared with other forms of treatment\n\n【2】 #Indications and current treatments\nBasal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common type of skin cancer in the UK. It is generally a slow-growing, locally invasive epidermal skin tumour that rarely spreads to other parts of the body. Although it is not usually life-threatening, the tumour can cause extensive tissue destruction if it is not treated. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the second most common type of skin cancer in the UK. It may spread into local lymph nodes and metastasise to other parts of the body.\nCurrent treatments for BCC and SCC include surgical excision and radiotherapy, and less commonly curettage, cryotherapy and chemotherapy\n\n【3】 #The procedure\nElectrochemotherapy is a local treatment that aims to enhance the effects of chemotherapy.\nThe procedure is performed with the patient under general or local anaesthesia with or without sedation. Chemotherapy drugs are given first, either intravenously or directly into the tumour. Drug dose is individualised based on either body surface area or tumour volume. Shortly after drug administration, brief and intense electric pulses are delivered around or directly into the tumour using either surface plates or needle electrodes. This makes the cell membranes more permeable to the chemotherapy drugs so that their cytotoxic effect is increased. Different-shaped plates or electrodes are used depending on the tumour size, extent, shape and location. Treatment duration may vary depending on the number and size of tumours. Larger tumours may need several applications to cover the entire surface. Repeated treatments can be performed if necessary (within the lifetime dose limits of the chemotherapy drugs)\n\n【4】 #Efficacy\n\n【5】 A non-randomised comparative study of 113 patients (85 basal cell carcinoma  and 28 squamous cell carcinoma ) compared 2 different electric pulse sequences for electrochemotherapy of stage I (T1N0M0) BCC and SCC tumours. The complete response rate was 83% at 12 months.\nA non-randomised comparative study of 34 patients comparing electrochemotherapy against either intratumoural bleomycin alone or electric pulse therapy included 21 patients with BCC or SCC (66 tumours). The study reported an objective response rate of 100% and a complete response of 94% (51/54) in BCC primary tumours treated with electrochemotherapy at 12 weeks. The 1 SCC tumour treated with electrochemotherapy had a partial response. There were no complete responses in the 11 BCC tumours treated with either intratumoural bleomycin alone (8 tumours) or electric pulse therapy alone (3 tumours).\n\n【6】 A case series of 6 patients (3 BCC and 3 SCC tumours) reported no damage to nerve or ocular function after electrochemotherapy in 4 patients with tumours close to the facial nerve or eye muscles.\nThe specialist advisers listed additional key efficacy outcomes as quality of life, control of bleeding and reduction of odour from fungating tumours\n\n【7】 #Safety\nLocalised involuntary muscle contractions and a sensation of a jolt or shock associated with the electric pulses were reported in the study of 34 patients and 3 case series of 50, 24 and 15 patients. They stopped immediately when the electric pulses were discontinued.\nA septal cartilage perforation was reported in 1 patient receiving treatment in the right nasal vestibule in the case series of 6 patients. This occurred after a biopsy performed 8 weeks after treatment\nSlight burning of the skin was reported in 87% (7/8) of patients on whom the plate electrodes were used in the study of 34 patients. This healed within 6–8 weeks\nErythema and oedema 72 hours after treatment were reported in the case series of 24 patients\nIncreased tear production in the ipsilateral eye was reported in 2 patients who received treatment for tumours in the medial canthus in the case series of 6 patients. This caused no visual impairment and resolved within 2 months\nPost-treatment pain was described as 'moderate' and was managed with paracetamol and diclofenac for 5–7 days in the case series of 6 patients.\nOther side effects attributed to the chemotherapy agent such as slight nausea and allergic reactions were also reported.\n\n【8】 #Information for patients\nNICE has produced information on this procedure for patients and carers (Information for the public). It explains the nature of the procedure and the guidance issued by NICE, and has been written with patient consent in mind\n\n【9】 #About this guidance\nThis guidance was developed using the NICE interventional procedures guidance process.\nChanges since first publication\nThis guidance replaces interventional procedure guidance 447 (published March 2013). IPG447 was reconsidered by the Interventional Procedures Advisory Committee after an internal procedural error was identified. As a result of this changes were made to sections 1.1, 1.3 and 1.5 of the guidance and NICE consulted again on the revised document.\nThe changes made to the recommendations were:\n\n【10】 The following text was added: 'Patient selection is particularly important because the cure rates for established treatments in accessible sites are very high.'\nSome minor changes were also made to the rest of the document after consultation.\nWe have produced a summary of this guidance for patients and carers.\nNICE produces guidance, standards and information on commissioning and providing high-quality healthcare, social care, and public health services.  We have agreements to provide certain NICE services to Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.  Decisions on how NICE guidance and other products apply in those countries are made by ministers in the Welsh government, Scottish government, and Northern Ireland Executive\nYour responsibility\nImplementation of this guidance is the responsibility of local commissioners and/or providers. Commissioners and providers are reminded that it is their responsibility to implement the guidance, in their local context, in light of their duties to have due regard to the need to eliminate unlawful discrimination, advance equality of opportunity and foster good relations. Nothing in this guidance should be interpreted in a way that would be inconsistent with compliance with those duties.\n\n【11】 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 2014.

{"seq_id": "574cb420-39de-43db-8def-9f381402769c", "title": null, "text": "【0】 Metoclopramide (oral)\n\n【1】 #Overview\nMetoclopramide (oral) is an antiemetic that is FDA approved for the treatment of symptoms due to gastroesophageal reflux and diabetic gastroparesis  Common adverse reactions include headache, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and somnolence.\n\n【2】 #Indications\nSymptomatic Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease\n- Metoclopramide Hydrochloride Orally Disintegrating Tablets are indicated as short-term (4 to 12 weeks) therapy for adults with symptomatic, documented gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) who fail to respond to conventional therapy.\nDiabetic Gastroparesis (Diabetic Gastric Stasis)\n\n【3】 #Important Limitations\n- Metoclopramide Hydrochloride Orally Disintegrating Tablets are indicated for adults only. Therapy should not exceed 12 weeks in duration. The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.\n\n【4】 #Dosage\nSymptomatic Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease\n- For the relief of symptomatic, documented gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), therapy should not exceed 12 weeks in duration.\n- Take 10 mg to 15 mg dose of Metoclopramide Hydrochloride Orally Disintegrating Tablets up to four times daily (e.g. at least 30 minutes before each meal and at bedtime). Doses may vary depending upon the symptoms being treated and the clinical response. If symptoms only occur intermittently or at specific times of the day, metoclopramide may be used in single doses up to 20 mg prior to the symptoms rather than continuous treatment.\n- Since there is a poor correlation between symptomatic relief and healing of esophageal lesions, any therapy directed at esophageal lesions is best confirmed by endoscopic evaluation. Although experience with the effects of metoclopramide on esophageal erosions and ulcerations is limited, healing was documented in a controlled trial using four times daily therapy at 15 mg/dose. Prolonged treatment (>12 weeks) with metoclopramide should be avoided in all but rare cases where therapeutic benefit is thought to counterbalance the risks to the patient of developing tardive dyskinesia.\nDiabetic Gastroparesis (Diabetic Gastric Stasis)\n- Take a 10 mg dose of Metoclopramide Hydrochloride Orally Disintegrating Tablets up to four times a day (e.g. at least 30 minutes before each meal and at bedtime).\n- Administration of metoclopramide injection up to 10 days may be required before symptoms subside, at which time oral administration may be instituted. Since diabetic gastric stasis is frequently recurrent, Metoclopramide Hydrochloride Orally Disintegrating Tablets therapy should be reinstituted at the earliest manifestation.\n\n【5】 #Renal Impairment\n- Some patients, such as the elderly or those with impaired kidney function (creatinine clearance below 40 mL/min) may be more sensitive to the therapeutic dose or the adverse effects of metoclopramide. Therefore, these patients should start therapy at a lower dose (approximately half the recommended dosage) and the dose should be titrated according to their overall clinical response and/or adverse event profile. Dialysis is not likely to be an effective method of drug removal in overdose situations.\n\n【6】 - 5 mg Tablets: Metoclopramide Hydrochloride Orally Disintegrating Tablets are round, white to off-white, flat faced beveled edge tablet, debossed with ‘N’ on one side and “581” on the other side.\n\n【7】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Metoclopramide (oral) in adult patients.\n\n【8】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Metoclopramide (oral) in adult patients.\n\n【9】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Pediatric)\nThere is limited information regarding FDA-Labeled Use of Metoclopramide (oral) in pediatric patients.\n\n【10】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Metoclopramide (oral) in pediatric patients.\n\n【11】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Metoclopramide (oral) in pediatric patients.\n\n【12】 #Contraindications\nIntestinal Obstruction, Hemorrhage, or Perforation\n- Do not use metoclopramide whenever stimulation of gastrointestinal motility may be dangerous such as in the presence of gastrointestinal hemorrhage, mechanical obstruction, or perforation.\nPheochromocytoma\nMetoclopramide is contraindicated in patients with pheochromocytoma because the drug may precipitate a hypertensive crisis, most likely due to release of catecholamines from the tumor. Such hypertensive crises may be controlled by phentolamine.\nKnown Sensitivity or Intolerance\n- Metoclopramide is contraindicated in patients with known sensitivity or intolerance to the drug.\nEpilepsy\nConcomitant Medications with Extrapyramidal Reactions\n\n【13】 Tardive Dyskinesia - Treatment with metoclopramide can cause tardive dyskinesia (TD), a potentially irreversible and disfiguring disorder characterized by involuntary movements of the face, tongue, or extremities. The risk of developing tardive dyskinesia increases with the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose. An analysis of utilization patterns showed that about 20% of patients who used metoclopramide took it for longer than 12 weeks. Treatment with metoclopramide for longer than the recommended 12 weeks should be avoided in all but rare cases where therapeutic benefit is thought to outweigh the risk of developing TD.\n- Although the risk of developing TD in the general population may be increased among the elderly, women, and diabetics, it is not possible to predict which patients will develop metoclopramide-induced TD. Both the risk of developing TD and the likelihood that TD will become irreversible increase with duration of treatment and total cumulative dose.\n- Metoclopramide should be discontinued in patients who develop signs or symptoms of TD. There is no known effective treatment for established cases of TD, although in some patients, TD may remit, partially or completely, within several weeks to months after metoclopramide is withdrawn.\nAcute Dystonic Reactions, Drug-induced Parkinsonism, and Other Extrapyramidal Symptoms\n- Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), manifested primarily as acute dystonic reactions, occur in approximately 1 in 500 patients treated with the usual adult dosages of 30 to 40 mg/day of metoclopramide. These usually are seen during the first 24 to 48 hours of treatment with metoclopramide, occur more frequently in pediatric patients and adult patients less than 30 years of age and are even more frequent at higher doses. These symptoms may include involuntary movements of limbs and facial grimacing, torticollis, oculogyric crisis, rhythmic protrusion of tongue, bulbar type of speech, trismus, or dystonic reactions resembling tetanus. Rarely, dystonic reactions may present as stridor and dyspnea, possibly due to laryngospasm. If these symptoms occur, inject 50 mg diphenhydramine hydrochloride intramuscularly. Benztropine mesylate, 1 to 2 mg intramuscularly, may also be used to reverse these reactions.\n- Drug-induced Parkinsonism can occur during metoclopramide therapy, more commonly within the first 6 months after beginning treatment, but also after longer periods. Parkinsonian symptoms generally subside within 2 to 3 months following discontinuation of metoclopramide. Patients with a history of Parkinson’s disease should be given metoclopramide cautiously, if at all, since such patients can experience exacerbation of Parkinsonian symptoms when taking metoclopramide.\nNeuroleptic Malignant Syndrome\n- There have been rare reports of an uncommon but potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) associated with metoclopramide. Clinical manifestations of NMS include hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, altered consciousness, and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac arrhythmias). The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to identify cases where the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g. pneumonia, systemic infection) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, malignant hyperthermia, drug fever and primary central nervous system (CNS) pathology. The management of NMS should include immediate discontinuation of metoclopramide and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy; intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring; and, treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. Bromocriptine and dantrolene sodium have been used in treatment of NMS, but their effectiveness has not been established.\nDepression\nHypertension\nCongestive Heart Failure and Ventricular Arrhythmia\nWithdrawal from Metoclopramide\nPhenylketonurics:\n- Phenylalanine is a component of aspartame. Each 5 mg and 10 mg Metoclopramide Hydrochloride Orally Disintegrating Tablets contains 4.7 mg of phenylalanine.\n\n【14】 ## Clinical Trials Experience\n- Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.\n- A total of 86 subjects entered three studies with Metoclopramide Hydrochloride Orally Disintegrating Tablets; 12 subjects entered a pilot bioavailability study (BA); 44 subjects entered a bioequivalence (BE) study, and 30 subjects entered a food-effect study The pilot BA study data are not included because it was performed with a formulation different from the Metoclopramide Hydrochloride Orally Disintegrating Tablets formulation.\n- The adverse experience profile seen with Metoclopramide Hydrochloride Orally Disintegrating Tablets was similar to metoclopramide tablets. Thirty-three  adverse reactions were reported after receiving Metoclopramide Hydrochloride Orally Disintegrating Tablets and 30 adverse reactions were reported after receiving metoclopramide tablets.\n\n【15】 ## Postmarketing Experience\n- The following adverse reactions are from the cumulative post-marketing experience with metoclopramide tablets. Since the reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.\nCNS Effects: Restlessness, drowsiness, fatigue, and lassitude occur in approximately 10% of patients receiving the most commonly prescribed dosage of 10 mg four times a day. Insomnia, headache, confusion, dizziness, or depression with suicidal ideation occurs less frequently. The incidence of drowsiness is greater at higher doses. There are isolated reports of seizures without clear-cut relationship to metoclopramide. Rarely, hallucinations have been reported.\n- Extrapyramidal Syndromes (EPS):\n- Acute dystonic reactions, the most common type of EPS associated with metoclopramide, occur in approximately 0.2% of patients (1 in 500) treated with 30 to 40 mg of metoclopramide per day. Symptoms include involuntary movements of limbs, facial grimacing, torticollis, oculogyric crisis, rhythmic protrusion of tongue, bulbar type of speech, trismus, opisthotonus (tetanus-like reactions), and rarely, stridor and dyspnea possibly due to laryngospasm; ordinarily these symptoms are readily reversed by diphenhydramine.\n- Drug-induced Parkinsonian-like symptoms may include bradykinesia, tremor, cogwheel rigidity, mask-like facies.\n- Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome: Rare occurrences of Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) have been reported.\nEndocrine Disturbances: Galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence secondary to hyperprolactinemia. Fluid retention secondary to transient elevation of aldosterone.\nCardiovascular: Hypotension, hypertension, supraventricular tachycardia, bradycardia, fluid retention, acute congestive heart failure, possible AV block.\nGastrointestinal: Nausea, bowel disturbances, primarily diarrhea.\nHepatic: Rarely, cases of hepatotoxicity characterized by such findings as jaundice and altered liver function tests, when metoclopramide was administered with other drugs with known hepatotoxic potential.\nRenal: Urinary frequency and incontinence.\nHematologic: A few cases of neutropenia, leukopenia, or agranulocytosis, generally without clear-cut relationship to metoclopramide. Methemoglobinemia in adults and especially with overdosage in neonates. Sulfhemoglobinemia in adults.\nAllergic Reactions: A few cases of rash, urticaria, or bronchospasm, especially in patients with a history of asthma. Rarely, angioneurotic edema, including glossal or laryngeal edema.\nMiscellaneous: Visual disturbances. Porphyria.\n\n【16】 #Drug Interactions\n- The effects of metoclopramide on gastrointestinal motility can impact the absorption of other drugs. The known drug-drug interactions are listed below.\nAnticholinergic and Narcotic Analgesic Drugs\nMonoamine Oxidase Inhibitors\n- Metoclopramide has been shown to release catecholamines in patients with essential hypertension suggesting that it should be used cautiously, if at all, in patients taking monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors.\nDrug Absorption\n- Absorption of drugs from the stomach may be diminished by metoclopramide (e.g. digoxin), whereas the rate and/or extent of absorption of drugs from the small bowel may be increased (e.g. acetaminophen, tetracycline, levodopa, ethanol, cyclosporine).\nInsulin\n- Because the action of metoclopramide will hasten the movement of food to the intestines and therefore the rate of absorption, insulin dosage or timing of dosage may require adjustment. Increasing movement of food to the intestines may lead to absorption of less glucose from a meal, hence less glucose in the circulation for a particular dose of administered insulin to act upon, resulting in hypoglycemia.\nAntidepressants, Antipsychotics, and Neuroleptics\n- Concomitant use of metoclopramide should be avoided in patients taking antidepressants, antipsychotics, and/or neuroleptics that have been associated with extrapyramidal reactions such as tardive dyskinesia or Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) that have occurred in association with metoclopramide\n\n【17】 ### Pregnancy\nPregnancy Category (FDA):\nTeratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category B\n- Reproduction studies have been performed in rats at oral doses about 6 times the maximum recommended human dose calculated on the basis of surface area, and in rabbits at oral doses about 12 times the maximum recommended human dose calculated on the basis of surface area, and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to metoclopramide. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.\n- Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) Pregnancy Category\nThere is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Metoclopramide (oral) in women who are pregnant.\n\n【18】 ### Labor and Delivery\n- The use of metoclopramide in labor and delivery has not been studied.\n\n【19】 ### Nursing Mothers\n- Metoclopramide is excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when metoclopramide is administered to a nursing mother. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from metoclopramide in nursing infants and because of the potential for tumorigenicity (including tumor promoting potential in rats), a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\n\n【20】 ### Pediatric Use\n- The safety and effectiveness of Metoclopramide Hydrochloride Orally Disintegrating Tablets in pediatric patients have not been established.\n- The safety profile of Metoclopramide Hydrochloride Orally Disintegrating Tablets in adults cannot be extrapolated to pediatric patients. Dystonias and other extrapyramidal reactions associated with metoclopramide are more common in the pediatric population than in adults. In addition, neonates have reduced levels of NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase making them more susceptible to methemoglobinemia, a possible side effect of metoclopramide use in neonates.\nPediatric PK\n- In an open-label study, six pediatric patients (ranging in age from 3.5 weeks to 5.4 months) with GERD received metoclopramide 0.15 mg/kg oral solution every 6 hours for 10 doses. The mean peak plasma concentration of metoclopramide after the tenth dose was twice the level (56.8 mcg/L) compared to after the first dose (29 mcg/L) indicating drug accumulation with repeated dosing. However, the PK parameters after the tenth dose were comparable to those observed after the first dose for the mean time to reach peak concentrations (2.2 hr); half-life (4.1 hr); clearance (0.67 L/h/kg); and volume of distribution (4.4 L/kg). The youngest patient (3.5 weeks) showed a significantly longer half-life after the first dose (23.1 hr) compared to after the tenth dose (10.3 hr), suggesting the reduced clearance observed at birth may be a reflection of the immature hepatic and renal systems.\n\n【21】 ### Geriatic Use\n- Clinical studies of metoclopramide did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether elderly subjects respond differently from younger subjects.\n- The risk of developing drug-induced Parkinsonism due to metoclopramide is dose-related. Geriatric patients should receive the lowest dose that is effective. If drug-induced Parkinsonism symptoms develop in a geriatric patient, Metoclopramide Hydrochloride Orally Disintegrating Tablets should be discontinued. The elderly may be at greater risk for tardive dyskinesia.\n- Sedation is a potential adverse event associated with metoclopramide use in the elderly.\n- Metoclopramide is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. For these reasons, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, starting at the low end of the dosing range, due to the greater frequency of decreased renal function, concomitant disease, or other drug therapy in the elderly.\n\n【22】 ### Gender\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Metoclopramide (oral) with respect to specific gender populations.\n\n【23】 ### Race\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Metoclopramide (oral) with respect to specific racial populations.\n\n【24】 ### Renal Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Metoclopramide (oral) in patients with renal impairment.\n\n【25】 ### Hepatic Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Metoclopramide (oral) in patients with hepatic impairment.\n\n【26】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Metoclopramide (oral) in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n\n【27】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\nCarcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\n- A 77-week study was conducted in rats with oral doses up to 40 mg/kg/day (about 5 times the maximum recommended human dose on surface area basis). Metoclopramide elevates prolactin levels and the elevation persists during chronic administration. Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately one-third of human breast cancers are prolactin-dependent in vitro, a factor of potential importance if the prescription of metoclopramide is contemplated in a patient with previously detected breast cancer. Although disturbances such as galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported with prolactin-elevating drugs, the clinical significance of elevated serum prolactin levels is unknown for most patients. An increase in mammary neoplasms has been found in rodents after chronic administration of prolactin-stimulating neuroleptic drugs and metoclopramide. Neither clinical studies nor epidemiologic studies conducted to date, however, have shown an association between chronic administration of these drugs and mammary tumorigenesis; the available evidence is too limited to be conclusive at this time.\n- In a rat model for assessing the tumor promotion potential, a two-week oral treatment with metoclopramide at a dose of 260 mg/kg/day (about 35 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area) enhanced the tumorigenic effect of N-nitrosodiethylamine.\n- Metoclopramide was positive in the in vitro Chinese hamster lung cell / HGPRT forward mutation assay for mutagenic effects and the in vitro human lymphocyte chromosome aberration assay for clastogenic effects. It was negative in the in vitro Ames mutation assay, the in vitro unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) assay with rat and human hepatocytes and the in vivo rat micronucleus assay.\n\n【28】 ### Administration\n- Oral\n\n【29】 ### Monitoring\nThere is limited information regarding Monitoring of Metoclopramide (oral) in the drug label.\n\n【30】 #IV Compatibility\nThere is limited information regarding IV Compatibility of Metoclopramide (oral) in the drug label.\n\n【31】 #Overdosage\n- Symptoms of overdosage may include drowsiness, disorientation, and extrapyramidal reactions. Anticholinergic or anti-Parkinson drugs or antihistamines with anti-cholinergic properties may be helpful in controlling the extrapyramidal reactions. Symptoms are self-limiting and may disappear within 24 hours.\n- Hemodialysis removes relatively little metoclopramide, probably because of the small amount of the drug in blood relative to tissues. Similarly, continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis does not remove significant amounts of drug. It is unlikely that dosage would need to be adjusted to compensate for losses through dialysis. Dialysis is not likely to be an effective method of drug removal in overdose situations.\n- Unintentional overdose has been reported in infants and children with the use of metoclopramide oral solution. While there was no consistent pattern to the reports associated with these overdoses, events included seizures, extrapyramidal reactions, and lethargy.\n- Methemoglobinemia has occurred in premature and full-term neonates who were given overdoses of metoclopramide (1 to 4 mg/kg/day orally, intramuscularly or intravenously for 1 to 3 or more days). Methemoglobinemia can be reversed by the intravenous administration of methylene blue. However, methylene blue may cause hemolytic anemia in patients with G6PD deficiency, which may be fatal.\n\n【32】 ## Mechanism of Action\n- Metoclopramide stimulates motility of the upper gastrointestinal tract without stimulating gastric, biliary, or pancreatic secretions. While its mode of action is unclear, it appears to sensitize tissues to the action of acetylcholine. The effect on motility is not dependent on intact vagal innervation, but can be abolished by anticholinergic drugs. Metoclopramide increases the tone and amplitude of gastric (especially antral) contractions, relaxes the pyloric sphincter and the duodenal bulb, and increases peristalsis of the duodenum and jejunum resulting in accelerated gastric emptying and intestinal transit. It increases the resting tone of the lower esophageal sphincter. It has little, if any, effect on the motility of the colon or gallbladder.\n\n【33】 ## Structure\n- Metoclopramide Hydrochloride Orally Disintegrating Tablet is an orally disintegrating tablet formulation of metoclopramide hydrochloride. The 5 mg strength tablets are round, white to off-white, flat faced beveled edge tablet debossed with ‘N’ on one side and “581” on the other side; it is comprised of 5 mg metoclopramide (as 5.91 mg of metoclopramide hydrochloride). The 10 mg tablets are round, white to off-white, flat faced beveled edge tablet debossed with ‘N’ on one side and “580” on the other side; it is comprised of 10 mg metoclopramide (as 11.82 mg of metoclopramide hydrochloride).\n- The active ingredient, metoclopramide hydrochloride, is a white crystalline, odorless substance, freely soluble in water. Chemically, it is 4 amino-5-chloro-N--2-methoxy benzamide monohydrochloride monohydrate. Its molecular formula is C14H22ClN3O2HClH2O. Its molecular weight is 354.3\n- Metoclopramide Hydrochloride Orally Disintegrating Tablets includes the following inactive ingredients: phosphoric acid, mannitol and starch, microcrystalline cellulose, colloidal silicon dioxide, amino methacrylate copolymer, butylated hydroxyanisole, butylated hydroxytoluene, crospovidone, aspartame, N-C mint flavor, magnesium stearate.\n\n【34】 ## Pharmacodynamics\n- The onset of pharmacological action of metoclopramide is 30 to 60 minutes following an oral dose; pharmacological effects persist for 1 to 2 hours. In patients with gastroesophageal reflux and low LESP (lower esophageal sphincter pressure), single oral doses of metoclopramide produce dose-related increases in LESP. Effects begin at about 5 mg and increase through 20 mg (the largest dose tested). The increase in LESP from a 5 mg dose lasts about 45 minutes and that of a 20 mg dose lasts between 2 and 3 hours. Increased rate of stomach emptying has been observed with single oral doses of 10 mg.\n- As there is no documented correlation between symptoms and healing of esophageal lesions, patients with documented lesions should be monitored endoscopically. For gastroparesis, the usual manifestations of delayed gastric emptying (e.g. nausea, vomiting, heartburn, persistent fullness after meals, and anorexia) appear to respond within different time intervals.\n\n【35】 ## Pharmacokinetics\nAdult PK of Metoclopramide Hydrochloride Orally Disintegrating Tablets\n- In a randomized, two-arm, two-way crossover study in 44 healthy adult (male and female) fasted subjects, Metoclopramide Hydrochloride Orally Disintegrating Tablet was bioequivalent to Reglan Tablets.\n- In a food-effect study with 28 subjects, Metoclopramide Hydrochloride Orally Disintegrating Tablets taken immediately after a high-fat meal had a 17% lower peak blood level than when taken after an overnight fast. The time to peak blood levels increased from about 1.75 hours under fasted conditions to 3 hours when taken immediately after a high-fat meal. The extent of metoclopramide absorbed (area under the curve) was comparable whether Metoclopramide Hydrochloride Orally Disintegrating Tablets was administered with or without food. The clinical effect of the decrease in peak plasma level if Metoclopramide Hydrochloride Orally Disintegrating Tablet is inadvertently taken with food is unknown.\n- Metoclopramide is rapidly and well absorbed. Relative to an intravenous dose of 20 mg, the absolute oral bioavailability of metoclopramide is 80% ± 15.5% as demonstrated in a crossover study of 18 subjects. Peak plasma concentrations occur at about 1 to 2 hr after a single oral dose. Similar time to peak is observed after individual doses at steady state Peak concentrations increase linearly with dose; time to peak concentrations remains the same; whole body clearance is unchanged; and the elimination rate remains the same. The average elimination half-life in individuals with normal renal function is 5 to 6 hr. Linear kinetic processes adequately describe the absorption and elimination of metoclopramide.\n- Approximately 85% of the radioactivity of an orally administered dose appears in the urine within 72 hr. Of the 85% eliminated in the urine, about half is present as free or conjugated metoclopramide.\n- The drug is not extensively bound to plasma proteins (about 30%). The whole body volume of distribution is high (about 3.5 L/kg) which suggests extensive distribution of drug to the tissues.\n- The in vivo disintegration time (time reported between placing the tablet on the tongue and it completely disintegrated into fine particles) was approximately one minute (with a range of 10 seconds to 14 minutes). In the two clinical trials (N = 96) with a mean ± SD being 76.8 ± 110.6 seconds and a median of 53.5 seconds.\n- Renal impairment affects the clearance of metoclopramide. In a study with patients with varying degrees of renal impairment, a reduction in creatinine clearance was correlated with a reduction in plasma clearance, renal clearance, non-renal clearance, and increase in elimination half-life. The kinetics of metoclopramide in the presence of renal impairment remained linear. The reduction in clearance as a result of renal impairment suggests that reduction of maintenance dosage should be done to avoid drug accumulation.\n\n【36】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\nThere is limited information regarding Nonclinical Toxicology of Metoclopramide (oral) in the drug label.\n\n【37】 #Clinical Studies\nThere is limited information regarding Clinical Studies of Metoclopramide (oral) in the drug label.\n\n【38】 #How Supplied\n- Metoclopramide Hydrochloride Orally Disintegrating Tablets 5 mg strength are round, white to off-white, flat faced beveled edge tablet debossed with ‘N’ on one side and “581” on the other side; it is comprised of 5 mg metoclopramide (as 5.91 mg of metoclopramide hydrochloride). These are packaged in blister cards as follows:\n\n【39】 ## Storage\n- Tablets should be stored at controlled room temperature, between 20°C and 25°C (68°F and 77°F).\n\n【40】 #Patient Counseling Information\n- Instruct patients to take Metoclopramide Hydrochloride Orally Disintegrating Tablets at least 30 minutes before eating and at bedtime.\n- A patient Medication Guide is available for Metoclopramide Hydrochloride Orally Disintegrating Tablets and printed at the end of the prescribing information. Instruct patients, families, and caregivers to read the Medication Guide and assist them in understanding its contents.\n- Inform patients or their caregivers of serious potential issues associated with metoclopramide use such as tardive dyskinesia, extrapyramidal symptoms, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Advise patients to inform their physician if symptoms associated with these disorders occur during or after treatment with Metoclopramide Hydrochloride Orally Disintegrating Tablets.\n\n【41】 #Precautions with Alcohol\n- Alcohol-Metoclopramide (oral) interaction has not been established.

{"seq_id": "7a166e6b-adfd-46c3-9499-a968e6f72bad", "title": null, "text": "【0】 HIV/AIDS in Uganda\nUganda has been hailed as a rare success story in the fight against HIV and AIDS, widely being viewed as the most effective national response to the pandemic in sub-Saharan Africa. President Yoweri Museveni established the AIDS Control Program (ACP) within the Ministry of Health (MOH) to create policy guidelines for Uganda’s fight against HIV/AIDS.  Uganda quickly realized that HIV/AIDS was more than a ‘health’ issue and in 1992 created a “Multi-sectoral AIDS Control Approach.” In addition, the Uganda AIDS Commission, also founded in 1992, has been instrumental in developing a national HIV/AIDS policy. A variety of approaches to AIDS education have been employed, ranging from the promotion of condom use to 'abstinence only' programmes. To further Uganda's efforts in establishing a comprehensive HIV/AIDS program, in 2000 the MOH implemented birth practices and safe infant feeding counseling.  According to the WHO, around 41,000 women received Preventing Mother To child Transmission (PMTCT) services in 2001. Uganda was the first country to open a Voluntary Counselling and Testing (VCT) clinic in Africa and pioneered the concept of voluntary HIV testing centers in Sub-Saharan Africa.\nThere are striking similarities with the history of HIV/AIDS response in Senegal, where an equally high-level political response was encouraged by the fact that the HIV-2 strain of the disease was discovered by a Senegalese scientist Dr Mboup.\n\n【1】 #Criticism\nThe scope of Uganda's success has come under scrutiny from new research. Research published in The Lancet medical journal in 2002 questions the dramatic decline reported. It is claimed statistics have been distorted through the inaccurate extrapolation of data from small urban clinics to the entire population, nearly 90 per cent of whom live in rural areas. Also, recent trials of the HIV drug nevirapine have come under intense scrutiny and criticism.\nUS-sponsored abstinence promotions have received recent criticism from observers for denying young people information about any method of HIV prevention other than sexual abstinence until marriage. Human Rights Watch says that such programmes \"leave Uganda’s children at risk of HIV\".  Alternatively, the Roman Catholic organization Human Life International says that \"condoms are adding to the problem, not solving it\" and that \"The government of Uganda believes its people have the human capacity to change their risky behaviors.\"\nPeople in Uganda are also being taught the ABCD's. A=Abstinence, B=Be Faithful, C=Condom use, or D=Death.\nOne argument is the drop in HIV/AIDS prevalence rates had more to do with the end of the civil war in 1985 than with any prevention efforts which happened subsequently. Nonetheless, there was an appearance that these efforts had been working. This helped create a virtuous cycle, whereby in was in the interest of politicians to talk about HIV/AIDS as this helped the prestige of the country and encouraged HIV/AIDS related aid money.\n\n【2】 #Structure of health provision\nThe provision of all health services in Uganda is shared between three groups: the government staffed and funded medical facilities; private for profit or self-employed medics including midwives and traditional birth attendants; and, NGO or philanthropic medical services.  The international health  funding and research community, such as the Global Fund for Aids, TB and Malaria, or bilateral donors are very active in Uganda.  Part of the success in managing HIV/AIDS in Uganda has been due to the cooperation between the government and the non-government service providers and these international bodies.  Public Private Partnerships in Health are often mentioned in Europe and North America to fund construction or research.  In Uganda, it is more practical being the recognition by the (public) government and (public) donor that a (private) philanthropic health facility can receive free test kits for HIV screening, free mosquito nets and water purification to reduce opportunistic infections and free testing and treatment for basic infections of great danger to PLHA.\n\n【3】 #Alternative proposals\nSeveral studies, conducted in Uganda and its neighbors, indicate that adult male circumcision may be a cost-effective means of reducing HIV infection. A review on the acceptability of adult male circumcision  indicated Across studies, the median proportion of uncircumcised men willing to become circumcised was 65% (range 29-87%). Sixty nine percent (47-79%) of women favored circumcision for their partners, and 71% (50-90%) of men and 81% (70-90%) of women were willing to circumcise their sons.\nAn economic analysis by  Bertran Auvert, MD, from the INSERM U687, Saint-Maurive, France, and colleagues estimated the cost of a roll-out over an initial 5-year period would be $1036 million ($748 – $1319 million) and $965 million ($763 – $1301 million) for private and public health sectors, respectively. The cumulative net cost over the first 10 years was estimated at $1271 million and $173 million for the private and public sectors, respectively . After adjustment for averted HIV medical costs, the researchers determined that the program would result in a net savings of about $2 per adult per year over the first 20 years of the program.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

NSTEMI is differentiated from unstable angina by the presence of elevated cardiac biomarkers secondary to myocardial injury.

{"seq_id": "d8f546ee-86bd-4815-9946-e2ae0f3414d6", "title": null, "text": "【0】 Clonazepam (marketed by Roche under the trade-names Klonopin in the United States and Rivotril in Europe, South America, Canada, India, and Australia) is a drug which is a benzodiazepine derivative. It is a highly potent anticonvulsant, amnestic, anxiolytic and muscle relaxant.  Clonazepam is also used in cases of amphetamine overdose as to reverse some of the adverse effects.\n\n【1】 #Pharmacology\nClonazepam is a chlorinated derivative of nitrazepam.\nClonazepam is classed as a nitrobenzodiazepine along with nitrazepam and flunitrazepam. Aromatic nitro-containing compounds such as clonazepam produce superoxide free radicals during cellular metabolism by endothelial cells. The nitro anion radical produced during clonazepam metabolism rapidly reacts with oxygen to form the free radical superoxide.\nClonazepam is chemically related to quinazolines and is a hapten. Like other benzodiazepines, clonazepam acts on benzodiazepine receptors which enhance the binding of GABA to the GABAA receptor which results in inhibitory effects on the central nervous system. Because of its powerful anxiolytic properties, it is said to be among the class of \"highly potent\" benzodiazepines. Although benzodiazepines are valuable in the treatment of anxiety disorders, they carry a high potential for physical and psychological dependence with profound withdrawal symptoms, especially if discontinued abruptly or overrapidly in certain individuals. Caution is advised when taking this or any benzodiazepine medication longer than a few weeks.\nOne milligram of clonazepam is approximately equivalent to twenty milligrams of diazepam.\nThe anticonvulsant properties of clonazepam and other benzodiazepines may be in part or entirely due to binding to voltage-dependent sodium channels rather than benzodiazepine receptors. Sustained repetitive firing seems to be limited by benzodiazepines effect of slowing recovery of sodium channels from inactivation.\nPeak blood concentrations of 6.5–13.5 ng/mL were usually reached within 1–2 hours following a single 2 mg oral dose of micronized clonazepam in healthy adults. In some individuals, however, peak blood concentrations were reached at 4–8 hours.\n\n【2】 #Indications\nClonazepam is sometimes used for refractory epilepsies; however, long-term prophylactic treatment of epilepsy has considerable limitations, most notably the loss of antiepileptic effects due to tolerance, which renders the drug useless with long-term use, and also side effects such as sedation, which is why clonazepam and benzodiazepines as a class should generally only be prescribed for the acute management of epilepsies. Clonazepam is less effective and potent as an anticonvulsant in bringing infantile seizures under control compared with nitrazepam in the treatment of West syndrome, which is an age-dependent epilepsy affecting the very young. However, as with other epilepies treated with benzodiazepines, long-term therapy becomes ineffective with prolonged therapy, and the side effects of hypotonia and drowsiness are troublesome with clonazepam therapy; other antiepileptic agents are therefore recommended for long-term therapy, possibly Corticotropin (ACTH) or vigabatrin. Clonazepam is therefore not recommended for widespread use in the management of seizures related to West syndrome. Also with long-term use, abrupt or overrapid withdrawal from clonazepam can precipitate withdrawal-related seizures if tolerance and physical dependence have developed.\nClonazepam has been used in the management of seizure disorders in children and also for infantile spasms. However, usefulness of clonazepam is limited due to its deleterious effect on neurological function, especially its negative effect on cognition. Clobazam, a 1,5-benzodiazepine, has shown to be less neurotoxic than 1,4-benzodiazepines such as clonazepam.\nClonazepam may be prescribed for:\n- Epilepsy\n- Anxiety disorders\n- Panic attacks due to the often chronic nature of panic disorders, long-term therapy may be advocated. SSRIs are considered the primary drug, along with cognitive-behavioral therapy, with\n- Initial treatment of mania, together with firstline drugs such as lithium, haloperidol or risperidone\n- Restless legs syndrome\n\n【3】 ## Availability\nClonazepam was approved in the United States as a generic drug in 1997 and is now manufactured and marketed by several companies.\nClonazepam is available in the U.S. as tablets (0.5, 1.0, and 2 mg), orally disintegrating tablets (wafers) (0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, and 2 mg), liquid solutions (2.5 mg/mL) and for injection (1 mg/mL)\nLike all benzodiazepines, clonazepam is a benzodiazepine receptor agonist. Long-term use (more than 2–4 weeks) can lead to a number of problems, including muscle weakness and fatigue, tolerance, physical dependence and withdrawal syndromes upon discontinuation. The benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, which may appear during reduction or withdrawal of clonazepam treatment, can be reduced in intensity with gradual reduction of dosage.\nClonazepam is sometimes used to help with Methadone withdrawal symptoms\n\n【4】 #Side effects\nCommon:\n- Drowsiness\n- Impairment of cognition and judgment\nImpaired coordination\nDizziness\n- Impaired balance\n- Anterograde amnesia (common with higher doses)\nRare:\n- Paradoxical disinhibition (most frequently in children, the elderly, and in persons with developmental disabilities)\nExcitement\nIrritability\nImpulsivity\nSome users report hangover-like symptoms of being drowsy, having a headache, being sluggish, and being irritable after waking up if the medication is taken before sleep.  This is likely the result of the medication's long half-life, which continues to affect the user after waking up, as well as its disruption of the REM cycle.\n- Rage\nWithdrawal-related:\n- Anxiety, irritability, insomnia - Panic attacks, tremor - Seizures similar to delirium tremens (with long-term use of excessive doses)\nMany individuals treated on a long-term basis develop a form of dependence known as \"low-dose dependence\", as was shown in one double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 34 therapeutic low-dose  benzodiazepine users—physiological dependence was demonstrated via flumazenil-precipitated withdrawal.\nUse of alcohol or other CNS depressants while taking clonazepam greatly intensifies the effects (and side effects) of the drug. Side effects of the drug itself are generally benign, but sudden withdrawal after long-term use can cause severe, even fatal, symptoms.\n\n【5】 ## Special precautions\nCaution in the Elderly. Increased risk of impairments, falls and drug accumulation.\nCaution in children. Clonazepam is not recommended for use in those under 18. Use in very young children may be especially hazardous. Clonazepam was implicated along with the drugs diphenylhydantoin and nitrazepam in the death of a 7 and a half month old girl. She developed inclusions consisting of lamellar profiles, situated in membrane-bound cytosomes which were found mainly in astrocytes, but also in neurones and in axons of peripheral nerves before dying. Lipofuscin bodies were also found to be increased in number.\n\n【6】 #Protracted withdrawal\n10–15% of individuals treated with clonazepam on a long-term basis (in excess of 30 days of continuous use) develop a protracted withdrawal syndrome.  Protracted withdrawal lasts for months, years, or a lifetime after clonazepam is discontinued.  Protracted withdrawal results from structural brain damage, which is often irreversible.\nCommon protracted withdrawal symptoms include:\n- Anxiety\n- Insomnia - Depression\n- Tinnitus\n- Tingling and numbness in limbs\n- Muscle pain and tension\n- Weakness\n- Cramps\n- Tremors\n- Irritable bowel\n- Cognitive dysfunction\nBenzodiazepines including  clonazepam may inhibit the glucuronidation of morphine leading to increased levels of and prolongation of the effects of morphine. Clonazepam may inhibit morphine metabolism more than any other benzodiazepine.\n\n【7】 #Pregnancy\nThere is some medical evidence of various malformations eg cardiac or facial deformations when used in early pregnancy, however the data is not conclusive. The data is also inconclusive whether benzodiazepines such as clonazepam cause developmental deficits or decreases in IQ when taken during pregnancy. Clonazepam when used late in pregnancy may result in the development of a severe benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome in the neonate and also floppy infant syndrome. Withdrawal symptoms from benzodiazepines in the neonate may include hypotonia, and reluctance to suck, to apnoeic spells, cyanosis, and impaired metabolic responses to cold stress. These symptoms may persist for hours or months after birth.\n\n【8】 #Overdose\nAn individual who has consumed too much clonazepam will display one or more of the following symptoms:\n- Somnolence (difficulty staying awake)\n- Mental confusion\n- Hypotension\n- Impaired motor functions\nImpaired reflexes\nImpaired coordination\nDizziness\n- Coma\nUnless combined with other drugs, deep coma or other manifestations of severe central nervous system depression are rare, and the mortality rate associated with poisoning is very low.  As with other benzodiazepines, overdose symptoms of clonazepam may be reversed with flumazenil (Romazicon).\n\n【9】 #Recreational use and abuse\nRelatively few cases of addiction arise from legitimate use of benzodiazepines.\nIf in tablet form, they are most commonly used as a secondary drug to increase the pleasure resulting from a primary drug, or to lessen or prevent some of the primary drug's negative side effects.

{"seq_id": "94abab87-3294-4e6f-8940-d08a49c30097", "title": null, "text": "【0】 PCI in the patient in cardiogenic shock\n\n【1】 #Cardiogenic Shock\nCardiogenic shock (CS) is a disorder caused by decreased systemic cardiac output (cardiac index 2.2 L/min/m2 or less) in the presence of adequate intravascular volume, resulting in tissue hypoxia. Shock may be the result of severe left ventricular dysfunction, but it may also occur when left-ventricular function is well preserved. Shock can occur in the setting of mechanical complications such as acute severe mitral regurgitation (8.3%) or ventricular septal rupture (4.6%), right ventricular infarction (3.4%) and prior severe valve disease. Other causes of cardiogenic shock include myocarditis, end-stage cardiomyopathy, myocardial contusion, septic shock with severe myocardial depression, myocardial dysfunction after prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.\nAs early as 1912, Herrick described the clinical features of cardiogenic shock in patients with severe coronary artery disease. He noted that patients in CS had a weak, rapid pulse, feeble cardiac tones, pulmonary rales, dyspnea, and cyanosis. Systemic hypotension is generally regarded as essential to the diagnosis of the syndrome. There is, however, great variability in the degree of hypotension that defines shock. Commonly, the cut-off point for systolic blood pressure is less than 90 mmHg. Other systemic signs of hypoperfusion such as altered mental state, cold, clammy skin and oliguria are associated with reduction in systolic blood pressure.\n\n【2】 #Pathophysiology\nThe pathophysiology of shock involves a downward spiral: Ischemia causes myocardial dysfunction, which in turn worsens ischemia. When a critical mass of left ventricular myocardium is ischemic or necrotic and fails to pump, stroke volume and cardiac output decrease. Myocardial perfusion is compromised by hypotension and tachycardia which in turn exacerbates ischemia. Fluid retention and impaired diastolic filling caused by tachycardia and ischemia may result in pulmonary congestion and hypoxia. Decreased cardiac output also compromises systemic perfusion, which can lead to lactic acidosis and further compromise of systolic performance. Anaerobic glycolysis also causes accumulation of lactic acid and resultant intracellular acidosis. Apoptosis (programmed cell death) may also contribute to myocyte loss in myocardial infarction.\nMyocardial stunning represents persistent post ischemic dysfunction after restoration of normal blood flow. In myocardial stunning, the myocardial performance recovers completely eventually. A combination of oxidative stress, perturbation of calcium homeostasis and decreased myofilament responsiveness to calcium seem to be associated with stunning. Hibernating myocardium is in a state of persistently impaired function at rest because of severely reduced coronary blood flow. Stunning and hibernation develop as an adaptive response to hypoperfusion. Both conditions may indicate recovery over time as reperfusion occurs.\n\n【3】 ## New Pathogenic Insights\nIn the SHOCK (SHould we emergently revascularize Occluded coronaries for Cardiogenic shocK) trial and registry, wide range of ejection fractions and left ventricular sizes were noted. The systemic vascular resistance (SVR) was not elevated on vasopressors with a wide range of SVR measured. A clinically evident systemic inflammatory response syndrome was often present in patients with CS. Most survivors had class I congestive heart failure (CHF) status. Cardiac power, the product of cardiac index and mean arterial pressure was strongly associated with mortality. The ability to raise SVR may be an important compensatory mechanism to support blood pressure. Vasodilators (endogenous and exogenous) interfere with the critical compensatory vasoconstriction mechanism in response to a reduction in cardiac output. The classic notion that CS develops when 40% of the left ventricle (LV) is irreversibly damaged is inconsistent with the observations in the SHOCK studies. In the SHOCK studies, 50% of patients survive and there is improved ejection fraction following revascularization. Following shock, 58% of patients are in New York Heart Association CHF class I. The range of LVEFs, LV size and SVR in patients with cardiogenic shock would indicate that the pathogenesis is multifactorial.\n\n【4】 #Epidemiology and Demographics\nCardiogenic shock (CS) is the most common cause of death in the setting of acute myocardial infarction with mortality around 70-80% and this remains almost the same in the last three decades. CS complicates 7-10% of patients with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and 3% of patients with non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). In the Worcester Heart Attack registry, there was no significant difference in the incidence of CS over a 23 year period. However, the short term survival has increased in recent years since the use of coronary reperfusion strategies. In the NRMI (National Registry of Myocardial Infarction) study, the overall in-hospital cardiogenic shock mortality decreased from 60.3% in 1995 to 47.9% in 2004 (p<0.001).\n\n【5】 #Treatment\nThere are differences observed between countries in the management of patients with cardiogenic shock. In the GUSTO-I (Global Utilization of Strategies to Open Occluded Arteries) trial, Holmes et al demonstrated that aggressive diagnostic and therapeutic procedures were used more commonly in the USA than in the other countries: cardiac catheterization (58% vs. 23%), intra-aortic balloon pump (35% vs. 7%), right heart catheterization (57% vs. 22%) and ventilatory support (54% vs. 38%). In total, 483 (26%) patients treated in the USA underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), compared with 82 (8%) patients in other countries. As a result of these differences in the use of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, there was a significant difference in the 30-day mortality among patients treated in the USA compared to those treated in other countries (50% vs. 66%, p<0.001).\nEarly and prompt recognition of symptoms and signs of cardiogenic shock in patients with acute myocardial infarction is the most important step for their management. Previous studies suggest that PCI in the setting for cardiogenic shock is not associated with improved mortality at 30 days. However, there is a significant survival benefit at 6 months. Therefore once properly diagnosed, these patients should be immediately transferred to a PCI capable and experienced catheterization laboratory for primary PCI. Patients with cardiogenic shock who undergo fibrinolysis or rescue PCI for failed fibrinolysis remain at substantial risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. According to current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association and European Society of Cardiology guidelines, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is a Class I indication for patients 75 years with cardiogenic shock. Current guidelines also recommend direct or expeditious transfer of patients with cardiogenic shock to hospitals with primary PCI capabilities and favor primary PCI over fibrinolytic therapy for this group of patients.\n\n【6】 ## Treatment Strategies\nInitial management of patients with CS includes fluid resuscitation unless pulmonary edema is present. In patients with inadequate tissue perfusion and adequate intravascular volume, cardiovascular support with inotropic agent should be initiated. Catecholamine infusions must be carefully titrated to maximize coronary perfusion pressure. The phosphodiesterase inhibitors such as amrinone and milrinone have positive inotropic and vasodilatory actions. Diuretics should be used to treat patients with pulmonary edema and enhance oxygenation.\nNo trials have demonstrated that thrombolytic therapy reduces mortality rates in patients with established CS. In the GISSI (Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Streptochinasi nell’Infarto Miocardico) trial, 30-day mortality was 69.9% and 70.1% among those who received streptokinase and placebo respectively. In the GUSTO trial, mortality was 56% and 59% among those who received Streptokinase and tissue plasminogen activator respectively in the setting of CS.\n\n【7】 ## Impact of Angioplasty, Stenting and Abciximab on Survival\nA number of retrospective studies have demonstrated that PCI in the setting of CS is associated with improved outcomes. In the SHOCK trial registry, not only was the mortality rate lower in patients selected for cardiac catheterization (51%) than in those not selected (85%), but the mortality rate was also lower in catheterized patients who did not undergo revascularization (58%). In the SHOCK randomized trial, the 30-day mortality rate was 46.7% in the early intervention group and 56% in the initial medical therapy group. At 6 months there was 12% absolute risk reduction using the intervention strategy. Subgroup analysis demonstrated substantial improvement in mortality rates in patients younger than 75 years of age at 30 days (41% intervention vs. 57% medical therapy) and at 6 months (48% vs. 69% respectively).\nStenting and the use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors have been studied in the setting of cardiogenic shock complicating acute myocardial infarction. A previous study by Chan et al demonstrated that the use of stent and abciximab in patients with cardiogenic shock was associated with greater achievement of TIMI 3 flow and significant improvement in mortality compared to stent only, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) plus abciximab, and PTCA alone . TIMI grade 3 flow was higher with stent plus abciximab than with the other interventions (85% vs. 65%, p<0.048). This was confirmed in another study where patients who underwent stenting plus abciximab did significantly better in the short and long term.\n\n【8】 ### Gender Differences\nIn the SHOCK trial after adjusting for patient demographics and treatment strategies, there was no difference in in-hospital mortality between men and women (odds ratio = 1.03, 95% confidence interval of 0.73 to 1.43, p = 0.88). Mortality was also similar for women and men who were selected for revascularization (44% vs. 38%, p=0.244). But women encountered more mechanical complications such as mechanical ventricular rupture and acute severe mitral regurgitation. Women also had higher incidence of hypertension, diabetes and lower cardiac index.\n\n【9】 ### Diabetic Patients\nCardiogenic shock develops approximately twice as often among diabetics (10.6%) as among non diabetic patients (6.2%) with acute MI. The prognosis of diabetics with cardiogenic shock is similar to the prognosis of non diabetic patients with cardiogenic shock. Among patients with STEMI and  and without a prior diagnosis of diabetes undergoing primary PCI, admission glucose concentration is a very strong independent predictor for 1-year mortality. In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, the odds for mortality increased by 16% for every 1 mmol/L increase in plasma glucose concentration ( 1.155, 95% CI 1.070-1.247), after adjustment for left ventricular ejection fraction <40%, age older than 75 years, male sex and TIMI 3 flow after PCI.\n\n【10】 ### Elderly Patients\nPatients in cardiogenic shock aged ≥75 years are associated with increased 30-day mortality (75%) compared to those aged <75 years (41.4%) in the PCI group in a sub analysis from the SHOCK trial. In the medical therapy group, 30-day mortality was 53.1% for those aged ≥75 years and 56.8% for patients aged <75 years. Another study demonstrated that 56% of patients survived to be discharged from the hospital and of the hospital survivors, 75% were alive at 1 year. A registry study from northern New England demonstrated that mortality rate for patients over 75 years of age was 46% which is significantly less than that reported in the randomized control trials.\nAmong patients with multivessel disease, CS is especially frequent in those with anterior STEMI, female gender, proximal culprit lesion, and chronic occlusion of other vessels.\n\n【11】 ### PCI for Failed Fibrinolysis\nPCI for failed fibrinolysis in the setting of CS has been studied. Rescue PCI in patients with CS is associated with poor outcome compared to those who undergo primary PCI particularly in those patients aged > 70 years of age. A previous study demonstrated that rescue PCI, anterior myocardial infarction, multivessel disease and lower final TIMI 3 flow in patients with cardiogenic shock were an independent predictor of 30-day mortality in patients undergoing rescue PCI. In patients aged >70 years, the one year mortality was 100% in those who underwent rescue PCI compared to 70% in those who underwent primary PCI. Hence rescue PCI in patients aged >70 years may be a futile treatment.\n\n【12】 ### L-NG Monomethyl-Arginine\nCS complicating acute myocardial infarction is often simply not only due to extensive infarction and ischemia with reduced ventricular function but also involves inflammatory mediators. These mediators increase nitric oxide and peroxynitrite levels, resulting in further myocardial dysfunction and failure of an appropriate peripheral circulatory response. Cotter et al assessed the safety and efficacy of L-NMMA (L-NG monomethyl-arginine), a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, in the treatment of cardiogenic shock. In 11 consecutive patients, within 10 minutes of L-NMMA administration, mean arterial pressure (MAP) increased from 76±9 to 109±22 mmHg (+43%). Urine output increased within 5 hours from 63±25 to 156±63 cc/h (+148%). Cardiac index decreased during the steep increase in MAP from 2.0±0.5 to 1.7±0.4 L/(min.m2) (-15%); however, it gradually increased to 1.85±0.4 L/(min.m2) after 5 hours. The heart rate and the wedge pressure remained stable. Twenty-four hours after L-NMMA discontinuation, MAP (+36%) and urine output (+189%) remained increased; however, cardiac index returned to pretreatment level. No adverse events were detected. Ten out of eleven patients were weaned off mechanical ventilation and IABP. Eight patients were discharged from the coronary intensive care unit, and seven (64%) were alive at 1-month follow-up.\n\n【13】 ### Levosimendan\nThe effect of levosimendan (a positive inotropic agent) on long-term survival was compared to dobutamine treatment in patients with STEMI revascularized by primary coronary angioplasty who subsequently developed CS. This demonstrated that levosimendan compared to dobutamine did not improve long-term survival in this group of patients. However, levosimendan seems to be effective in improving the Doppler echocardiographic parameters of left ventricular diastolic function in patients with STEMI revascularized by primary PCI who developed cardiogenic shock.\n\n【14】 ### Intra-aortic Balloon Pump\nThe intra aortic balloon pump (IABP) is the most commonly used temporary cardiac assist device. It has immediate beneficial hemodynamic effects, augmenting coronary perfusion, increasing myocardial oxygen supply and decreasing myocardial oxygen demand. In the setting of acute myocardial infarction, left ventricular unloading by an IABP could prevent early infarct expansion, ventricular remodeling, or both.\nAlthough used widely in the setting of cardiogenic shock, the use of aortic counter pulsation in non-shocked but high risk patients remains uncertain. Prolonged use of intra aortic balloon pump (IABP) can be beneficial in patients with CS in terms of improvement in left ventricular function and exercise capacity. In the SHOCK trial registry, patients who received a fibrinolytic and had intra aortic balloon pump support had reduced mortality compared to those who had IABP alone, fibrinolytic alone, and no fibrinolytic and IABP groups (47%, 52%, 63%, 77% respectively).\nSeveral studies in critically ill patients suggest that an IABP may be beneficial in those with impaired coronary arterial autoregulation. However, in the setting of a fixed, severe coronary artery stenosis (>90% luminal diameter narrowing), the IABP-induced increase in aortic diastolic pressure is not transmitted to the vessel’s post stenotic segment; as a result, post stenotic coronary blood flow is unchanged, but can increase flow once the stenosis has been treated by angioplasty. In hospitals without primary PCI capability, stabilization with IABP and thrombolysis followed by transfer to a tertiary care facility may be the best management option.\n\n【15】 ### Left Ventricular Assist Devices\nLeft ventricular assist devices (LVAD) can be used more effectively to reverse the hemodynamic and metabolic parameters than by the use of IABP. The use of LVAD is however associated with more complications including major bleeding. A previous study demonstrated no difference in 30-day mortality with the use of LVAD and IABP.\nThe LVADS are commonly used as a bridge to cardiac transplantation and bridge to recovery in patients with chronic heart failure. It has also been used in high risk PCI. A study by Giombolini et al demonstrated that left ventricular assist device can be easily and rapidly deployed either in emergency or in elective high-risk PCI to achieve complete cardiac assistance.\nThere are three generations of LVADs currently available based on the order they were developed and the type of pumping mechanisms used. The HeartMate I (Thermo Cardiosystems Inc. Woburn, MA) is the first generation device that uses pusher plates and has inflow and outflow valves. These devices are efficacious at unloading the left ventricle and maintaining the circulation, with the capacity to pump up to 10 litres/min. The disadvantages of these pulsatile devices include their large size. The complexity of their insertion can result in infection and compression of neighboring organs. Because these devices contain valves, they are not long lasting.\nThe second-generation LVADs are continuous-flow impeller pumps. These are considerably smaller and safer to insert. They have only one moving part (the rotor) and are expected to have greater durability than first-generation devices. Furthermore, the use of these pumps requires full anticoagulant therapy to maintain an international normalized ratio of 2.0–2.5, coupled with antiplatelet medication, such as aspirin or clopidogrel. Experience with these devices is increasing and data from the first series of patients to receive the HeartMate II (Thoratec, Pleasanton, CA) have now been published. In a prospective, multicenter study without a concurrent control group, 133 patients with end-stage heart failure who were on a waiting list for heart transplantation underwent implantation of HeartMate II. The principal outcomes occurred in 100 patients (75%). The median duration of support was 126 days (range, 1 to 600). The survival rate during support was 75% at 6 months and 68% at 12 months. At 3 months, therapy was associated with significant improvement in functional status (according to the New York Heart Association class and results of a 6-minute walk test) and in quality of life (according to the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure and Kansas City Cardiomyopathy questionnaires). Major adverse events included postoperative bleeding, stroke, right heart failure, and percutaneous lead infection. Pump thrombosis occurred in two patients. In October 2008 Thoratec Corp. recalled \"small batches\" of HeartMate II pumps following the deaths of five patients who had the implant. The five deaths occurred when physicians were unable to replace devices with worn electrical wire. Thoratec Corp. has confirmed 27 total instances where HeartMate II implants have needed replacement due to the wiring issue.\nSeveral third generation devices are now being studied in phase I studies such as involving the Ventrassist (Ventracor Ltd, Chatswood, Australia) and HVAD (HeartWare, Miramar, FL) devices, and more recently the DuraHeart (Terumo Kabushiki Kaisha  Shibuya-ku, Japan) system. The current third generation pumps are thought to last approximately 5 years.\n\n【16】 ## Predictors of Outcome Following PCI\nVarious baseline and angiographic factors determine the outcome of patients in cardiogenic shock undergoing PCI. In the SHOCK trial, the independent correlates of mortality were as follows: increasing age (p<0.001), lower systolic blood pressure (p<0.009), increasing time from randomization to PCI (p<0.019), lower post-PCI TIMI flow (0/1 vs. 2/3) (p<0.001), and multivessel PCI (p<0.040). Other studies confirm these observations . Another study demonstrated that elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) on admission was associated with increased 1-year mortality (p=0.002). Patients with myocardial blush grade 0/1 following PCI were associated with significantly elevated in-hospital (81% vs. 14%) and long term (81% vs. 29%) mortality compared to those with MBG 2/3 respectively.\n\n【17】 ## Functional State and Quality of Life Post PCI\nAlthough the one year mortality following PCI in the setting of cardiogenic shock is still high at 54%, patients who survive have good functional status. Follow-up of patients in the SHOCK trial demonstrated that patients who underwent PCI had lower rate of functional deterioration than those who underwent medical therapy for cardiogenic shock. At one year, 83% of patients discharged alive after an initial hospitalization for cardiogenic shock were in NYHA functional class I or II. In particular, patients who underwent early revascularization had better mental health immediately after discharge and were protected against deterioration in their functional status over time. Moreover, survivors of early revascularization after shock can have recovery of physical function similar to that of patients with elective revascularization.\n\n【18】 ## PCI vs. CABG in Cardiogenic Shock\nIn the SHOCK (SHould we emergently revascularize Occluded coronaries for Cardiogenic shocK) trial 63.3% of patients underwent PCI and 36.7% underwent coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG). There were more diabetics (48.9% vs. 26.9%; p=0.02), 3-vessel disease (80.4% vs. 60.3%; p=0.03), and left main coronary disease (41.3% vs. 13.0%; p=0.001) in the CABG group compared to the PCI group. In the PCI group, 12.3% had 2-vessel and 2.5% had 3-vessel interventions. The survival rates were 55.6% in the PCI group compared with 57.4% in the CABG group at 30 days (p=0.86) and 51.9% compared with 46.8% respectively at 1 year (p=0.71). Although there was no significant difference in the mortality in the two groups, patients with extensive coronary artery disease complicated by cardiogenic shock should be considered for CABG.\n\n【19】 #Conclusion\nCardiogenic shock following an acute myocardial infarction is associated with high mortality rates (50-80%). The key to a good outcome is an organized approach with rapid diagnosis and prompt initiation of therapy to maintain blood pressure and improve cardiac output. Expeditious coronary revascularization is crucial. Although there was a general increase in the rate of primary PCI for CS over time that was associated with an improved survival, there was no temporal impact of the ACC guidelines for the management of CS in clinical practice. PCI and CABG were still underused in the NRMI registry, potentially due to the higher mortality rates that are seen in patients with CS. PCI may be more liberally used in the elderly.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

A sample swabbed from the throat is put in a special cup (culture) that allows infections to grow. If an infection grows, the culture is positive. The type of infection is found using a microscope, chemical tests, or both. If no infection grows, the culture is negative.\nExamples of infections that may be found during a throat culture include:\n- Candida albicans\nThis fungus causes thrush, an infection of the mouth and tongue and sometimes of the throat.  a picture of thrush in the mouth.\n- Group A streptococcus\nThis bacteria can cause strep throat, scarlet fever, and rheumatic fever. If strep throat is likely, a test called a rapid strep test (or quick strep) may be done before a throat culture. With a rapid strep test, results are ready in 10 minutes instead of 1 to 2 days with a throat culture. If the rapid strep test results are positive, antibiotics can be started immediately. A throat culture is more accurate than the rapid strep test. The rapid strep test can give false-negative results even when strep bacteria are present. When the results of a rapid strep test are negative, many health professionals recommend doing a throat culture to make sure that strep throat is not present.\n- Neisseria meningitidis\nThis bacteria can cause meningitis. If bacteria grows in the culture, other tests may be done to check which antibiotic will treat the infection best. This is called susceptibility or sensitivity testing.\n\n【2】 #Why it is done\nA throat culture may be done to:\n- Find the cause of a sore throat. Most sore throat infections are caused by a virus. A throat culture shows the difference between a bacterial infection and a viral infection. Finding the organism that is causing the infection can guide treatment.\n- Check a person who may not have any symptoms of infection but who carries bacteria that can spread to others. This person is called a carrier.\n\n【3】 #How to prepare\nThe patient does not need to do anything before having this test. The health professional should know if the patient has recently taken any antibiotics.\n\n【4】 #How it is done\nThe patient will be asked to tilt her/his head back and open her/his mouth as wide as possible.

Given reactants A and B, with an excited intermediate ◊, we have:\nFor example, if is luminol and  is hydrogen peroxide in the presence of a suitable catalyst we have:\nwhere:\n- where 3-APA is 3-aminophthalate\n- 3-APA is the excited state fluorescing as it decays to a lower energy level.\nThe decay of the excited state to a lower energy level is responsible for the emission of light. In theory, one photon of light should be given off for each molecule of reactant, or Avogadro's number of photons per mole. In actual practice, non-enzymatic reactions seldom exceed 1% QC, quantum efficiency.\nA standard example of chemiluminescence in the laboratory setting is found in the luminol test, where evidence of blood is taken when the sample glows upon contact with iron. When chemiluminescence takes place in living organisms, the phenomenon is called bioluminescence. A lightstick emits light by chemiluminescence.\n\n【2】 #Liquid-phase reactions\n- Luminol in an alkaline solution with hydrogen peroxide  in the presence of iron or copper, or an auxiliary oxidant, produces chemiluminescence. The luminol reaction is - Cyalume, as used in a lightstick, emits light by chemiluminescence of a fluorescent dye (also called fluorescor) activated by cyalume reacting with hydrogen peroxide in the presence of a catalyst,such as sodium salicylate. It is the most efficient chemiluminescent reaction known. up to 15% quantum efficiency.\nWhen the activated fluorescent dye decays to a lower energy level, light is given off. The color depends upon the dye\n- Oxalyl chloride (C2O2Cl2) produces light when oxidized - but only in the presence of a sensitiser, similar to the above examples. If oxalyl chloride is treated with H2O2 in non-aqueous media (e.g. CH2Cl2) in the presence of a sensitiser, emission of light is obtained. The colour, intensity and duration of light emission depend on the sensitiser used. Rodamin 6 G gives bright orange light with moderate duration of emission.\nThere are a number of other chemiluminescence reactions. Some of them are briefly described here.\n- Ru(bipy)32+ is a ruthenium(II) complex which undergoes oxidation to ruthenium(III) if certain oxidizing agents are introduced. If ruthenium(III) complex is then reduced in alkaline medium, emission of light occurs. First, there is a reaction:\n- TMAE (tetrakis(dimethylamino)ethylene) emits clear blue-green light upon oxidation by air.\n- Pyrogallol  is also capable of light emission. If an aqueous solution of pyrogallol, NaOH and K2CO3 is mixed with formaldehyde, short-lived red emission occurs.\n- Solutions containing ions of manganese (VII, IV, III) show Chemiluminescence (690 nm) when reduced by sodium borohydride at low pH to Mn(II)\n\n【3】 #Gas-phase reactions\n- One of the oldest known chemoluminescent reactions is that of elemental white phosphorus oxidizing in moist air, producing a green glow. This is actually a gas-phase reaction of phosphorus vapor, above the solid, with oxygen producing the excited states (PO)2 and HPO.\n- Another gas phase reaction is the basis of nitric oxide detection in commercial analytic instruments applied to environmental air quality testing. Ozone is combined with nitric oxide to form nitrogen dioxide in an activated state.\n\n【4】 #Bioluminescence\nChemiluminescence takes place in numerous living organisms, the American firefly being a widely studied case of bioluminescence.\nThe firefly reaction has the highest known quantum efficiency,  QC of 88%, for chemiluminescence reactions. ATP (adenosine tri-phosphate), the ubiquitous biological energy source, reacts with luciferin with the aid of the enzyme luciferase to yield an intermediate complex. This complex combines with oxygen to produce a highly chemiluminescent compound.\n\n【5】 #ECL\nEnhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) is a common technique for a variety of detection assays in biology.  A horseradish peroxidase enzyme (HRP) is tethered to the molecule of interest (usually through labeling an immunoglobulin that specifically recognizes the molecule).  This enzyme complex, then catalyzes the conversion of the ECL substrate into a sensitized reagent in the vicinity of the molecule of interest, which on further oxidation by hydrogen peroxide, produces a triplet (excited) carbonyl which emits light when it decays to the singlet carbonyl.  Enhanced chemiluminescence allows detection of minute quantities of a biomolecule. Proteins can be detected down to femtomole quantities (ECL review), well below the detection limit for most assay systems.\nThe mechanism of action for a typical ECL reagent:\n\n【6】 #Applications\n- gas analysis: for determining small amounts of impurities or poisons in air. Other compounds can also be determined by this method (ozone, N-oxides, S-compounds). Typical example is NO determination with detection limits down to 1 ppb\n- analysis of inorganic species in liquid phase\n- analysis of organic species: useful with enzymes, where the substrate isn't directly involved in chemiluminescence reaction, but the product is - detection and quantitation of biomolecules in assay systems such as ELISA and Western blots\n- DNA sequencing using pyrosequencing\n- Lighting objects. Chemiluminescence kites, emergency lighting.\n- Combustion analysis: certain radical species (such as CH- and OH*) give off radiation at specific wavelengths.

Similar to many other skin conditions, it may present with associated dryness, scaling, or erythema. Commonly affected regions include neck, ankles, extremities, scalp and genital region. The incidence and prevalence of the condition are not well established, but this is observed to be more common in adult female patients. The pathophysiology remains unclear, but it's thought to arise from disturbances between central and peripheral neural tissue in the perception of itch, causing that persistent itch-scratch cycle. Several psychological disturbances like anxiety and depression have been associated with this dermatological condition.\n\n【2】 #Pathophysiology\n- LSC develops over the regions which are accessible to scratching.\n- The pathogenesis of LSC is unclear, but clinical lesions are due to severe paroxysmal pruritus. The physical and emotional component of the cause are well known, compared to genetic, vascular and neurogenic component.\n- Skin with atopic dermatitis and atopic diathesis is most likely to develop lichenification.\n- Emotional disturbances such as anxiety, depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder or other stressors contribute to itching in many cases.\n- Some studies tried to find genetic support to pathology of LSC. Like, Serotonin transporter (5HTT) gene polymorphism and dysfunction association to LSC .\n- Long interspersed element-1 (LINE-1) pattern changes in epidermis of LSC was found in a study.\n- On microscopic histopathological analysis, LSC appears as a hyperkeratotic plaque, with parakeratosis, acanthosis, spongiosis, papillary dermal fibrosis with vertical streaking of collagen bundles, irregularly thickened rete edges, and pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia.\n- Electron microscopy shows collagen fibers attached to and above lamina basalis.\n\n【3】 #Causes\n- The most common cause of LSC is emotional factors. Other causes of LSC include\nAtopic dermatitis\nEczema\nMechanical trauma\nExtremes of temperature/humidity\nScars\nXerosis\nPsoriasis\nInsect bites\nLithium\nP-phenylenediamine (PPD)\n\n【4】 #Differentiating Lichen simplex chronicus from other Diseases\n- Lichen simplex chronicus (LSC) must be differentiated from other diseases that cause thickened skin lesions such as:\n- Atopic dermatitis - Contact allergic dermatitis - Tinea, candida and other fungal infections\n- Lichen planus\n- Psoriasis - Mycosis fungoides\n- Squamous cell carcinoma and others.\n\n【5】 #Epidemiology and Demographics\n- LSC has been estimated to occur among 12% of the people around the world.\n\n【6】 ## Age\n- LSC is more commonly observed among patients aged 30 to 50 years old.\n\n【7】 ## Gender\n- LSC is more commonly affected to females than males.\n- The female to male ratio is approximately 2:1.\n\n【8】 ## Race\n- Previous studies in past have shown LSC more common in African Americans and Asians.\n\n【9】 #Natural History, Complications and Prognosis - Prognosis is generally good with treatment, but some become persistent lesions.\n- Special association with erectile dysfunction is seen in some studies.\n- Some cases of malignant transformation of the lesion into squamous cell carcinoma or verrucous carcinoma is seen.\n\n【10】 ## History and Symptoms\n- Diagnosis of LSC includes physical exams, history, and dermoscopy. The most common symptom is Itching.\n- LSC mostly occurs in easy to reach areas like the head, neck, extensor sides of forearm, scalp, vulva, pubis, and scrotum. It can occur as a single or multiple lesions.\n- Itching usually occurs in the nighttime, and it's mostly absent when active.\n\n【11】 ## Physical Examination\n- Lesions appear erythematous, scaly, well-demarcated, rough plaques eventually turning into thickened and hyperpigmented due to chronic pruritus.\n- These plaques can vary in size from 3 by 6 centimeters to 6 by 10 centimeters. The color of the lesion varies according to the stage of the lesion.\n\n【12】 ## Laboratory Findings\n- There are no specific laboratory findings associated with LSC.\n- You can do few tests to identify the stressor behind the disease like serum IgE levels to support underlying atopy.\n\n【13】 ## Other Diagnostic Studies\n- Patch test can exclude possible allergic contact dermatitis as a cause of disease.\n- Potassium hydroxide examination and fungal cultures help to eliminate tinea cruris and candidal infections, especially when the lesions are involved with genitals.\n- Skin biopsies may be performed to exclude psoriasis or mycosis fungoides.\n\n【14】 ## Medical Therapy\n- The mainstay of therapy for LSC is to reduce pruritus and support the lesion and body to heal.\n- Topical anti-inflammatory therapy like corticosteroids, topical emollients, anti-histamines, and antibiotics if suspicion of secondary infection.\n- Corticosteroids decreases the inflammation, and also improve the lesion hyperkeratosis.\n- Depending on the size, extent and location of lesion, choice of corticosteroid (mild or high potent topical preparations) is made.\n- Intralesional steroid injections are used for refractory cases.\n- Occlusion has been observed to improve the treatment effectiveness. Also, it prevents from scratching.\n- Psychological treatment, such as psychotherapy, as well as drugs like anti-anxiety medications are found to be effective, because of the emotional factors of the disease.\n- Other treatments like doxepin and capsaicin, aspirin/dichloromethane, immunomodulators like tacrolimus and pimecrolimus, and injections of botulinum toxins.\n\n【15】 ## Surgical/ Other therapy\n- Cryosurgery, Phototherapy, Photochemotherapy and Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation have been studied in cases not responsive to any of the medical therapy.\n\n【16】 ## Prevention\n- Effective measures for the primary prevention of LSC include helping patients to minimize scratching on an individual basis.

There are some concerns about safety with regard to the risk of perforation and bleeding. Therefore, this procedure should only be used with special arrangements for clinical governance, consent and audit or research.\nClinicians wishing to undertake ESD of lower gastrointestinal lesions should take the following actions.\nInform the clinical governance leads in their Trusts.\nEnsure that patients understand the uncertainty about the procedure's safety and efficacy in relation to the risks of perforation and bleeding, and that conversion to open surgery may be necessary. Patients should be provided with clear written information. In addition, the use of NICE's information for patients ('Understanding NICE guidance') is recommended.\nAudit and review clinical outcomes of all patients having ESD of lower gastrointestinal lesions .\nEndoscopic submucosal dissection of lower gastrointestinal lesions is a technically challenging procedure and should only be carried out by clinicians with specific training in the technique.\nPatient selection should be carried out either by a colorectal surgeon or by both a colorectal surgeon and an endoscopist who are experienced in this technique.\nNICE encourages further research into ESD of lower gastrointestinal lesions. There should be clear documentation of the incidence of complications including perforation, haemorrhage and need for open surgery (with the reasons for this), rates of complete resection, and long-term outcomes including local recurrence and survival\n\n【2】 #The procedure\n\n【3】 #Indications and current treatments\nColorectal lesions may be benign, premalignant or malignant. Patients may be asymptomatic or may present with blood in the stool, change in bowel habit, abdominal pain or unexplained weight loss.\nLower gastrointestinal lesions may be investigated radiologically and/or endoscopically. Treatment normally involves resection of the lesions, which may be performed endoscopically or surgically. Current management of small colorectal lesions usually involves snare polypectomy or endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR). EMR usually removes lesions in small pieces, while ESD aims to resect lesions intact.\n\n【4】 #Outline of the procedure\nIn ESD, an electrocautery knife is used to resect the lesion in one piece (en bloc), aiming to reduce the risk of recurrence and to allow a more accurate histopathological assessment.\nThe procedure is performed with the patient under sedation (usually) or general anaesthesia. Lesions are visualised at colonoscopy and the submucosa injected with fluid to raise the lesion.\nA circumferential mucosal incision is made initially around the lesion with the electrocautery knife. Submucosal dissection is then performed under endoscopic visualisation, parallel to the muscle layer. Diathermy coagulation is used to achieve haemostasis, but endoscopic clips may also be required to control bleeding and/or treat small perforations.\nSections 2.3 and 2.4 describe efficacy and safety outcomes from the published literature that the Committee considered as part of the evidence about this procedure\n\n【5】 #Efficacy\nA systematic review of 14 studies including 1314 patients reported rates of en bloc lesion resection of 85% and complete cure (en bloc resection with histologically clear margins) of 75% (follow-up not stated).\nA non-randomised comparative study of 536 lesions (number of patients not stated) reported higher rates of en bloc resection in patients treated by ESD (99%, 463/468) compared with those treated by 'simplified' ESD using a snare (91%, 40/44) and those treated by small incision EMR (83%, 20/24) (p < 0.004 for both comparisons with ESD).\nCase series of 400 (405 lesions) and 278 (292 lesions) patients, reported en bloc resection rates of 87% (352/405) and 90% (263/292) of lesions respectively. Case series of 278, 42 and 35 patients reported en bloc resection with completely free margins in 15% (44/292) of lesions, and 74% (31/42) and 63% (22/35) of patients respectively.\nThe case series of 278 patients reported recurrent rectal intramucosal cancer in 3% (1/38) of lesions with incomplete resection that were followed-up for a median of 36 months (cancer was successfully removed).\n\n【6】 #Safety\nThe case series of 400 patients reported colonic wall perforation in 3% (14/405) of patients: all were detected intraprocedurally; all were managed successfully with endoscopic clips insertion; and 1 required surgical repair. In a case series of 186 patients (200 lesions) a perforation rate of 6% (12/200) was reported: 11 of the perforations were detected intraprocedurally and 1 was detected 2 days later (requiring surgical repair).\nThe case series of 186 patients reported rectal bleeding, prompting emergency colonoscopy for application of endoscopic clips in 1% (2/200) of lesions. One bleed occurred on the day of the procedure and the other occurred 10 days later.\nAcute intestinal obstruction 18 hours after the procedure was reported in a case report of 1 patient (treated by aggressive fluid resuscitation and colonoscopic decompression).\nThis guidance requires that clinicians undertaking the procedure make special arrangements for audit. NICE has identified relevant audit criteria and developed audit support (which is for use at local discretion) for this guidance.\n\n【7】 #Information for patients\nNICE has produced information on this procedure for patients and carers ('Understanding NICE guidance').

The complete text of the Medication Guide is reprinted at the end of this document.\nPatients should be advised of the following issues and asked to alert their prescriber if these occur while taking Effexor XR.\n\n【2】 ## Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk\nPatients, their families, and their caregivers should be encouraged to be alert to the emergence of anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania,mania, other unusual changes in behavior, worsening of depression, and suicidal ideation, especially early during antidepressant treatment and when the dose is adjusted up or down. Families and caregivers of patients should be advised to look for the emergence of such symptoms on a day-to-day basis, since changes may be abrupt. Such symptoms should be reported to the patient's prescriber or health professional, especially if they are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms. Symptoms such as these may be associated with an increased risk for suicidal thinking and behavior and indicate a need for very close monitoring and possibly changes in the medication.\n\n【3】 ## Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance\nClinical studies were performed to examine the effects of venlafaxine on behavioral performance of healthy individuals. The results revealed no clinically significant impairment of psychomotor, cognitive, or complex behavior performance. However, since any psychoactive drug may impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that venlafaxine therapy does not adversely affect their ability to engage in such activities.\n\n【4】 ## Concomitant Medication\nPatients should be advised to inform their physicians if they are taking, or plan to take, any prescription or over-the-counter drugs, including herbal preparations and nutritional supplements, since there is a potential for interactions.\n\n【5】 ## Alcohol\nAlthough venlafaxine has not been shown to increase the impairment of mental and motor skills caused by alcohol, patients should be advised to avoid alcohol while taking venlafaxine.\n\n【6】 ## Allergic Reactions\nPatients should be advised to notify their physician if they develop a rash, hives, or a related allergic phenomenon.\n\n【7】 ## Pregnancy\nPatients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy.\n\n【8】 ## Nursing\nPatients should be advised to notify their physician if they are breast-feeding an infant.\n\n【9】 ## Mydriasis\nMydriasis (prolonged dilation of the pupils of the eye) has been reported with venlafaxine. Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they have a history of glaucoma or a history of increased intraocular pressure .", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "46c29ec5-4076-4558-bd6f-26d6090a5ed3", "title": null, "text": "【0】 Sandbox: Breast Abscess\nSynonyms and keywords: Mammary abscess, Zuska's disease, lactiferous fistula.\n\n【1】 #Historic Perspective\nIn 1841, Dr. Jonathan Toogood reported a case of breast abscess out of only 5 cases at this time.\n\n【2】 #Classification\nBreast Abscess may be classified according to anatomical location and lactation state of the patient into subtypes.\n- Anatomical location: subcutaneous, subareolar, interlobular, central and retromammary\n- Lactation state: Lactational and Non-Lactational.\n\n【3】 #Pathophysiology\nFollowing untreated mastitis, breast abscess could occur.\nBreast abscess is usually caused by staphylococcus aureus bacterial infection to an injured breast skin. Staphylococcus aureus could form abscess by secretion of several killing agents like enzymes and toxins. In a reaction to these bacterial substances, assembled white blood cells in this tissue produces anti-bacterial anti-bodies that help in killing the bacteria. However, these cells cause damage to the soft tissue contributing in the abscess formation.\nAs the breast abscess is the complicated form of mastitis, the pathophysiology is mostly like the mastitis pathophysiology.\n\n【4】 ## Pathogenesis\nBreast abscess is the result of underlying inflammation (mastitis) in the breast skin. Injury may happen either during the lactation process from the infant or in the non-lactaion state of the patient as a cracking in the breast skin. This injury accelerates the entry of the causative bacteria which by its role form the abscess. In neglected cases, there may be necrosis in the abscess location leads to fibrosis, scarring and nipple retraction.\n- Lactational:\nInjured breast skin allows the entrance of the bacteria to the mammillary ducts. This bacteria can be from the infant or the mother herself. Overproduction of the breast milk with no flow to the infant forms an opportunistic field for the bacteria to cause infection.\n- Breast Duct Ectasia: metaplastic change of the duct cells can cause duct ectasia. This change causes widening of the ducts lining which leads to thickening of the ducts and obstruction. The ducts become filled with fluid which leads to nipple discharge and infection by the entrance of the bacteria and can form pus and abscess as a final result.\nNon lactational breast abscess is less common than lactational form. It can be subgrouped into central, peripheral and skin associating.\nCracking in the skin will overtly help the bacteria to enter and form the abscess.\n\n【5】 ## Associated Diseases\nThere is no associated diseases with breast abscess.\n\n【6】 #Causes\nBreast abscess is a bacterial infectious disease that is caused by many bacterial pathogens and it may also be caused by fungi mostly common candida through the infant mouth. It is almost caused by the same pathogens causing mastitis. To understand the common species causing breast abscess we can classify them into gram +ve and gram -ve bacteria.\n\n【7】 #Differentiating Breast abscess from other Diseases\nBreast abscess should be differentiated from other diseases that cause swelling in the breast skin. These diseases are like mastitis, inflammatory breast cancer, galactocele, plugged duct, Mondor's syndrome and fibroadenoma.\nOther differential diagnosis of breast abscess can include:\n- Cystosarcoma phyllodes\n- Breast cyst\n- Lymphangioma - Lipoma\n\n【8】 #Epidemiology and Demographics\nBreast abscess is a rare disease that may occur due to improper treatment of the mastitis. There is no significant prevalence concerning the abscess.\n\n【9】 ## Incidence\n- The incidence of breast abscess is 3,000-11,000 per 100,000 of patients with mastitis.\n\n【10】 ## Age\n- Patients of all age groups may develop breast abscess.\n- Breast abscess is more common observed in the infants and the young more than the elder.\n- It is common in neonates with mastitis as approximately 50 percent of the neonatal patients with mastitis can develop breast abscess.\n\n【11】 ## Gender\nBreast abscess occurs commonly in women. It is very rare to be developed in men.\n\n【12】 ## Race\nBreast abscess is more prevalent in the african american race.\n\n【13】 ## More common risk factors\n- The most important risk factor of breast abscess is trauma.Trauma increases the possibility of the abscess formation as it facilitates the entrance of the causative bacteria into the soft tissue. Trauma can take place by different ways like shaving subareolar hair, piercing of nipple, infant's mouth during breastfeeding and picking acne lesions.\n- Smoking: increases the chances of abscess recurrence.\n- Obesity\n- Diabetes mellitus\n- Duct ectasia of the breast.\n- Local skin infection\n\n【14】 ## Less common risk factors\nThese risk factors are related more to the non-lactational breast abscess.\n- Insect bites\n- Surgical treatment: increases recurrence rate of the abscess.\n\n【15】 ## Natural History\nThere is no significant natural history regarding the breast abscess. However, the abscess generally if not treated it will burst around its site or necrosis will take place.\n\n【16】 ## Complications\nComplications that can develop in cases of breast abscess are:\n- Inflammatory breast cancer\n- Milk fistula - Antibioma\n\n【17】 ## Prognosis\nBreast abscess prognosis is good with treatment but it has a high recurrence rate. In non lactational abscess has a high chance of recurrence (more than 50% of the cases) In the lactational abscess the chance of recurrence is around 35-50% of the cases.\n\n【18】 ## History and Symptoms\nBreast abscess can be noticed first by the patient like a breast mass or lump. The patient usually has current breast infection(mastitis) or history of the infection.\nIn order to get precise diagnosis of breast abscess, these items should be put in consideration:\n- Local painful breast lump\n- History of mastitis - Nipple discharge\n- Risk factors of the breast abscess like trauma, duct ectasia or insect bites.\n- If lactating patient: breast-feeding history\n\n【19】 ### Most common symptoms\nBreast abscess has a typical abscess symptoms which are:\n- Fever and fatigue\n- Redness\n- Warmth\n- localized swelling\n- Breast skin induration\n\n【20】 ### Less common symptoms\n- Nipple discharge\n- Fistula - Mass in the breast\n\n【21】 ## Physical examination\nPatients with breast abscess are remarkable for the breast tenderness, swelling, redness and warmth of the skin.\n\n【22】 ## Laboratory findings\nBreast abscess diagnosis depends only on the clinical manifestations of the abscess not the laboratory findings. However, a culture could be taken from the milk and the pus just to decide the antibiotics needed for the treatment.\n\n【23】 ## Electrocardiogram\nThere is no significant changes in the EKG of breast abscess patients.\n\n【24】 ## Chest X ray\nThere is no x-ray changes in the chest of breast abscess patients.\n\n【25】 ## CT Scan\nCT scan is not used to diagnose the breast abscess. However, it can be performed to exclude other diseases like breast cancer.\n\n【26】 ## Ultrasound\n- Ultrasonography is an important imaging approach for diagnosis of the breast abscess. It is mainly used to differentiate between the different diseases causing breast lumps. It is also used in abscess needle aspiration guiding.\n- Breast abscess on chest ultrasonography appears like medium sized collections with not well defined margins and may have some areas with increased density.\n- There is no vascularity in the US image.\n\n【27】 ## Other Imaging Findings\nMammography is not indicated to be used in diagnosis of the breast abscess. However, it is strongly recommended in these cases to be used to differentiate between the breast abscess and other breast diseases and cancer.\n\n【28】 #Treatment\nBreast abscess treatment regimen includes both abscess drainage (surgically and by aspiration) and antibiotic medical therapy.It is treated mainly surgically through abscess drainage and suction.The patient should be referred immediately to the breast surgeon to start the abscess drainage.\n\n【29】 ## Medical therapy\nMedical treatment is important alongside the surgical treatment.Breast abscess is treated with antibiotic medical therapy as a supportive line to the surgical measures and to prevent the abscess recurrance. The choice of the antibiotic medications depends on the pathogen type however, the high possibility of the pathogen to be staphylococcus aureus leads to start the antibiotic medications before the result of the discharge culture\n\n【30】 ### General measures\nBreast abscess is painful so providing analgesics like profen is indicated to the patients. In order to relieve the pain and decrease the edema, breast support is indicated also.\n\n【31】 ### Lactaitonal breast abscess\n- Preferred regimen: Flucloxacillin 500 mg BID if there is no allergy to penicillin.\n\n【32】 ### Non lactational breast abscess\n- Preferred regimen: Co-amocyclave 375 TID if there is no allegy to penicillin.\n- Alternative regimen: Combination of Erythromycin 500 mg BID and Metronidazole 200 mg TID in case of penicillin allergy.\n\n【33】 ## Surgery\nThe first line of breast abscess treatment is US guided needle aspiration and surgical drainage of the abscess.\n\n【34】 ### Aspiration\nNeedle aspiration is used particularly in the small and medium sized abscesses. It can be US-guided aspiration or without the US. Local anesthesia is required in order to reduce the pain of the abscess location. It is preferred in case the breast skin is not affected with the abscess. This process is preferably done two or three times to ensure that the abscess location is completely clean from all the pus.\n\n【35】 ### Surgical drainage\nIf there is no response after several times of needle aspiration to the abscess then surgical drainage is the best line of treatment in this case. If there is no response to the surgical drainage then the last line of treatment is to do excision to the lactiferous duct of the affected breast.\nAbscess surgical drainage is the best line of treatment in these cases:\n- The skin is included in the abscess.\n- Unresponsive abscess to medical therapy or the aspiration.\n- Large abscesses.\nVideo explaining how the breast abscess is drained:\n\n【36】 ## Prevention\nBreast abscess prevention depends on the prevention of the risk factors and the patients hygiene specially in the lactating patients:\n- Patients should be taught to keep the nipple area clean especially if there is injury\n- Complete emptying of the breast after feeding the infant in order to prevent milk stasis - Keep the infant in a good contact during breastfeeding\n- Avoid dehydration in the nipple and the surrounding to prevent cracking\n- Infection control through washing hands frequently\n- It is advised to continue breastfeeding after the drainage to prevent recurrence and help healing.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Give a copy to the person and to their GP. The plan should include:\n\n【47】 #Lifestyle\nAdvise people who have had or are being treated for breast cancer that a healthy lifestyle is associated with a lower risk of recurrence, and that this should include:\nachieving and maintaining a healthy weight\nlimiting alcohol intake to below 5 units per week regular physical activity .\nFor guidance on smoking cessation, see the NICE guideline on tobacco: preventing uptake, promoting quitting and treating dependence.\n\n【48】 ## Upper limb exercises\nUpper limb exercises predominantly focus on gentle shoulder range-of-movement exercises and stretches aimed at regaining full and pain-free range of movement of the shoulder following breast cancer surgery and/or radiotherapy\n\n【49】 #Recommendations for research\nThe guideline committee has made the following key recommendations for research.\n\n【50】 #Surgery to the breast\nWhat is the optimum tumour-free margin width after breast-conserving surgery for women with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and invasive breast cancer?\n\n【51】 #Adjuvant bisphosphonate therapy\nWhich groups of people with early and locally advanced breast cancer would benefit from the use of adjuvant bisphosphonates?\n\n【52】 #Breast reconstruction\nWhat are the long-term outcomes for breast reconstruction in women having radiotherapy to the chest wall?\n\n【53】 #Neoadjuvant endocrine therapy in premenopausal women\nIs neoadjuvant endocrine therapy safe in premenopausal women with early breast cancer?\n\n【54】 #Neoadjuvant endocrine therapy in postmenopausal women\nIs there a benefit for neoadjuvant endocrine therapy in postmenopausal women with early breast cancer?\n\n【55】 #Neoadjuvant treatment\nWhat are the indications for postmastectomy radiotherapy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy?\n\n【56】 #Strategies to reduce arm and shoulder problems\nWhat is the most effective and cost-effective way of delivering the intervention (for example, type of physiotherapy or exercise, mode of delivery, number of sessions) to reduce arm and shoulder problems after breast cancer surgery or radiotherapy, and what is the acceptability of the intervention for different groups, such as:\nwomen, men, trans people and non-binary people people from minority ethnic family backgrounds people with learning disabilities or cognitive impairment, or physical disabilities, or both neurodiverse people?\n\n【57】 #Adherence and satisfaction for interventions to reduce arm and shoulder problems\nWhat is the adherence to, and satisfaction with, different intervention formats (for example, individual, group, virtual, and face to face) to reduce arm and shoulder problems after breast cancer surgery or radiotherapy, and what is the impact of greater adherence on effectiveness for different groups, such as:\nwomen, men, trans people and non-binary people people from minority ethnic family backgrounds people with learning disabilities or cognitive impairment, or physical disabilities, or both neurodiverse people?\n\n【58】 #Effectiveness of 26 Gy in 5 fractions over 1 week regimen in people receiving breast reconstruction\nWhat is the effectiveness of radiotherapy given in 26 Gy in 5 fractions over 1 week compared with 40 Gy in 15 fractions over 3 weeks in people with early or locally advanced invasive breast cancer who are offered breast reconstruction?\n\n【59】 #Effectiveness of 26 Gy in 5 fractions over 1 week regimen in people receiving nodal irradiation\nWhat is the effectiveness of radiotherapy given in 26 Gy in 5 fractions over 1 week compared with 40 Gy in 15 fractions over 3 weeks in people with early or locally advanced invasive breast cancer who are also offered nodal irradiation?\n\n【60】 #Rationale and impact\nThese sections briefly explain why the committee made the recommendations and how they might affect practice\n\n【61】 #Providing information and psychological support\n2.4\n\n【62】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThe committee agreed, based on their clinical expertise, that continued improvement in breast cancer survival as well as post-diagnosis quality of life needs ongoing research into new or refined treatment options to allow further optimisation of care.\nPeople having treatment for breast cancer should be advised about options for preserving their fertility, so the existing NICE guideline on this topic was cross-referred to.\n\n【63】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\nRecruitment into clinical trials wherever possible is already standard practice, so the recommendation is unlikely to result in a change in practice.\nDiscussion of fertility options is already standard practice, so the recommendation is unlikely to result in a change in practice.\n\n【64】 #Surgery to the breast\n3.2\n\n【65】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThere was some evidence that there was a reduced risk of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) local recurrence if tissue margins were greater than 0 mm, so the committee recommended further surgery (re-excision or mastectomy) to extend the margins if needed. Although there was no consistent evidence about tissue margins for invasive breast cancer, the committee agreed that further surgery should be offered.\nThe committee agreed that complete excision of the tumour with clear margins was essential for the high-quality care of people with DCIS or invasive breast cancer.\nAlthough there was evidence that aiming for wider margins reduced local recurrence, this did not improve overall survival. In addition, aiming for wider margins could lead to some people having unnecessary extra surgery. Given this uncertainty, the committee agreed the importance of personalised care and discussion to decide whether further surgery is needed.\n\n【66】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\nThe rates of further surgery currently vary across the country. Although the committee noted that the recommendations will reinforce current best practice, there may be some centres that will need to amend their practice in order to follow these recommendations.\n\n【67】 #Evaluation and management of a positive axillary lymph node\n\n【68】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThere was no new evidence that led the committee to change from the existing recommended practice (as recommended in the previous NICE guideline CG80) of:\n-ffering axillary clearance to people with preoperatively pathologically proven involvement of the axillary lymph nodes not offering axillary treatment after primary surgery to people with isolated tumour cells in their sentinel lymph nodes.\nThe committee agreed that current evidence shows that further axillary treatment after primary surgery does not improve survival for people with micrometastases and there are risks such as lymphoedema, so further treatment should not be offered to this population. There were unclear benefits and risks of further axillary treatment after primary surgery in people with only 1 or 2 sentinel lymph node macrometastases who have had breast-conserving surgery and have been advised to have whole-breast radiotherapy and systemic therapy, so the committee agreed that the risks and benefits of further treatment should be discussed with this group.\n\n【69】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\nThe committee agreed that the recommendations will result in a minor change in practice because some centres currently use mainly surgery and may not use radiotherapy. In addition, more time may need to be factored in to plan and deliver radiotherapy treatment.\n\n【70】 #Breast reconstruction\n\n【71】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThere was not much good evidence, but the committee agreed that the main benefits of immediate breast reconstruction compared with delayed reconstruction are improved aesthetic satisfaction, improved symmetry, improved health-related quality of life, lower overall rates of complications and a reduced need for further surgery. The committee agreed that in some circumstances, there are advantages to delayed reconstruction compared with immediate reconstruction (for example, reduced mastectomy flap loss and capsular contracture). Therefore, delayed reconstruction should also be an option for women who wish to have a reconstruction after mastectomy. The committee also agreed that the option of no reconstruction should also be discussed, because this may be the preferred option for some women.\nIn addition, although radiotherapy can impact on outcomes after breast reconstruction, there was no consistent evidence for worse outcomes between radiotherapy delivered after immediate reconstructions compared with radiotherapy before delayed reconstructions. Therefore, the committee agreed that immediate reconstruction should be offered regardless of plans for chest-wall radiotherapy.\nThere is little evidence regarding longer-term outcomes and different types of reconstruction. Because of this, the committee agreed that more research is needed to understand whether immediate breast reconstruction or delayed breast reconstruction is better in women who may need postmastectomy radiotherapy. So, they made a recommendation for research on long‑term outcomes for breast reconstruction in women having radiotherapy to the chest wall.\n\n【72】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\nThe recommendations may result in a substantial change in practice because many centres do not routinely offer immediate breast reconstruction to all women (especially those who have been advised to have radiotherapy). The impact will depend on how many immediate reconstructions are already carried out. In addition, the uptake of immediate breast reconstruction will also depend on women's preferences. There may be cost savings associated with immediate reconstructions because fewer surgical procedures are needed (reconstruction is done at the same time as mastectomy and there are lower rates of additional symmetrisation surgery).\n\n【73】 #Predictive factors\n6.3 and 1.6.5\n\n【74】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThere was not enough good evidence, so the committee agreed, using a formal consensus scoring system and their knowledge and experience, that progesterone receptor (PR) status should be assessed for all invasive breast cancers because:\nit will help when tailoring adjuvant therapy if people are already having testing at this stage, their PR status can be assessed without them having to wait for additional test results.\nThe committee also agreed that oestrogen receptor (ER), PR and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status assessments should be requested simultaneously at the time of initial diagnosis to ensure that results are available at the initial preoperative multidisciplinary team meeting (as well as the postoperative meeting). This will avoid delays and the need for additional discussions.\n\n【75】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\nMost people with invasive breast cancer have PR testing in current practice, although it is not always performed at diagnosis. The recommendations should reduce variation in practice and delays in starting treatment, and the need for pathology results to be discussed at more than 1 multidisciplinary meeting, so may lead to a small cost saving.\n\n【76】 #Adjuvant therapy planning\n6.9\n\n【77】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nGood evidence showed that the prognostic tool PREDICT is an accurate tool to estimate prognosis and the benefits of treatment in most people.\n\n【78】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\nThe committee agreed that most healthcare professionals already use the PREDICT tool, so this recommendation will not mean a big change in practice.\n\n【79】 #Ovarian function suppression\n7.5\n\n【80】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThere was evidence that ovarian function suppression increased overall survival when combined with tamoxifen, and that women who have had chemotherapy benefited more. However, ovarian function suppression did not improve disease-free survival. In addition, it induces a temporary menopause and can worsen the menopausal symptoms seen with tamoxifen.\nGiven the limited evidence of benefits and the side effects of the treatment, the committee agreed that healthcare professionals should discuss the potential benefits and risks with women. This will help women decide which treatment is right for them.\n\n【81】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\nThere is variation among centres in the use of ovarian function suppression, so the recommendations should lead to greater consistency and improve access to the treatment, even though not all women will wish to have it. There will be an increase in required resources for centres that do not currently provide ovarian function suppression because additional appointments will be needed to administer the medication and monitor side effects. However, this was not anticipated to be a substantial cost increase because of the number of centres already offering ovarian function suppression. Further, increased costs will be at least partially offset by improvements in survival outcomes.\n\n【82】 #Extended endocrine therapy\n\n【83】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nGood evidence showed that switching to an aromatase inhibitor after 5 years of tamoxifen improved disease-free survival compared with postmenopausal women who had only received tamoxifen for 5 years, with the benefits being greater in those women who had a greater risk of disease recurrence.\nThe evidence showed no benefit in terms of disease-free survival or overall survival from continuing tamoxifen beyond 5 years. However, some of the studies on tamoxifen were conducted in the 1980s and may not be relevant to current practice. In the committee's experience, continuing tamoxifen can be beneficial for some women.\nHowever, evidence showed that being on endocrine therapy for more than 5 years can increase the risk of problems such as endometrial cancer, osteoporosis, toxicity and phlebitis. The committee agreed that people will often prioritise survival even if this means they will have a reduced quality of life, but that people need to be informed about the possible benefits and risks so they can make a choice.\nBecause of the risk of problems with taking endocrine therapy for more than 5 years, the committee agreed that healthcare professionals should discuss the potential benefits and risks with women to help them make an informed choice about treatment, based on their own risk factors.\n\n【84】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\nSome centres already review treatment at 5 years and continue endocrine therapy with tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor when it could benefit women. Because a large number of women will be affected by these recommendations, the resource impact will be large for centres that are not currently providing treatment after 5 years.\n\n【85】 #Endocrine therapy for ductal carcinoma in situ\n\n【86】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThere was good evidence that tamoxifen after breast-conserving surgery for ER-positive DCIS improved disease-free survival and reduced rates of local recurrence in women who did not have radiotherapy. Because of their concerns about over-treatment, the committee agreed that women who were at higher risk (those who should have had radiotherapy, but who did not receive it) would benefit more. There was no evidence available for aromatase inhibitors; however, the committee agreed they would likely produce similar improvements in disease-free survival and reductions in local recurrence as tamoxifen. Therefore, the committee recommended endocrine therapy, rather than specifically tamoxifen.\nThe committee agreed that the benefits and risks of endocrine therapy should be discussed with the woman because of the potential treatment-related complications, such as menopausal symptoms, and the impact on family planning.\n\n【87】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\nOffering endocrine therapy after initial treatment of DCIS will be a change of practice because it is not currently routinely offered to these women. However, because of the small number of people with DCIS who will not receive radiotherapy, and the low cost of the medicines, the committee agreed that the impact will not be significant.\n\n【88】 #Adjuvant chemotherapy for invasive breast cancer\n\n【89】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThere was good evidence of improved survival when taxanes are added to anthracycline-based chemotherapy in people with node-positive and node-negative breast cancer. In both groups, the benefits and risks of treatment should be discussed because of the potential side effects associated with taxanes. Three-weekly docetaxel was identified as a regimen with potentially more toxicity than weekly or fortnightly paclitaxel.\n\n【90】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\nThese recommendations may result in a substantial change in practice because of increased taxane use, particularly for people with node-negative breast cancer and comorbidities.\nIn addition, there will be an increase in weekly and fortnightly chemotherapy regimens being offered (for people who cannot tolerate 3‑weekly regimens). These regimens have a higher cost because they are more resource intensive, and may affect capacity in chemotherapy services.\n\n【91】 #Biological therapy\n\n【92】 ## Why the committee made the recommendation\nThere was evidence that adjuvant trastuzumab can improve disease-free survival and overall survival in some people with T1a and T1b HER2-positive invasive breast cancer who were treated with adjuvant trastuzumab and chemotherapy. However, only a small number of people will benefit from this treatment and, because trastuzumab can cause heart problems, it is important to avoid offering it to people who do not need it. Because of this, the committee agreed that adjuvant trastuzumab should be an option for women with T1a and T1b tumours rather than a standard treatment.\nCombined chemotherapy and trastuzumab was not found to be cost effective when compared with chemotherapy alone. However, the committee agreed that it was more appropriate to compare combined chemotherapy and trastuzumab with no treatment because these are the strategies that are likely to be used in clinical practice. Because it is the HER2 positivity that increases risk of recurrence for people with small (T1a and T1b) tumours, it does not make sense from a clinical perspective to not treat the component that is increasing risk (that is, trastuzumab treatment for HER2 positivity). Further, the effect of chemotherapy alone in the economic model may be overestimated because the data may not fully reflect the population under consideration.\n\n【93】 ## How the recommendation might affect practice\nCurrently, T1 tumours are not routinely treated with adjuvant trastuzumab, so this recommendation will lead to a change in practice. However, the committee agreed that the number of additional people having treatment would be small, so the impact on current practice would be minor and unlikely to require a substantial increase in resources.\n\n【94】 #Adjuvant bisphosphonate therapy\n\n【95】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThere was good evidence that treatment with sodium clodronate and zoledronic acid improved disease-free and overall survival in postmenopausal women with node-positive invasive breast cancer.\nThere was little evidence of benefit for other bisphosphonates. The committee recommended considering zoledronic acid or sodium clodronate treatment for other high-risk populations (such as postmenopausal women with node-negative invasive breast cancer and a high risk of recurrence), based on the evidence that sodium clodronate has overall survival benefits in mixed populations.\nAlthough there is evidence that intravenous (IV) bisphosphonates have a higher risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw, oral bisphosphonates have a higher risk of gastrointestinal problems. There is also a risk of atypical femoral fractures and osteonecrosis of the external auditory canal with bisphosphonates. Because each drug and regimen has different risks, the potential benefits and risks should be discussed with women to help them make an informed choice.\nThere was little evidence on survival, particularly for premenopausal women on ovarian suppression, those with node-positive or node-negative disease, and those with positive or negative oestrogen or progestogen statuses. There was not enough evidence to make a recommendation relating to the use of adjuvant bisphosphonates in premenopausal women. The committee agreed that further research is needed to determine the long-term survival benefits and the groups of people most likely to benefit from adjuvant bisphosphonates. So, they made a recommendation for research on groups of people who would benefit from the use of adjuvant bisphosphonates.\n\n【96】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\nBisphosphonates are not consistently offered as adjuvant treatment, so this recommendation may lead to an increase in prescribing.\nGPs may need to monitor people taking oral bisphosphonates, but this is likely to be an annual review so would not have a large workload impact. However, people may make more GP visits if they have side effects from bisphosphonate treatment.\nThe committee agreed that IV bisphosphonates would usually be administered at the same time as chemotherapy drugs for the first 6 months of treatment, so this would not result in extra hospital visits for this period. After that, extra visits for administration and monitoring may be needed.\n\n【97】 #Radiotherapy techniques\n10.2\n\n【98】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThere was good evidence that radiotherapy to the internal mammary nodes reduced locoregional recurrence and improved survival. However, the committee took into account the potential for lung and heart toxicity, so recommended using a radiotherapy technique that minimises this risk.\n\n【99】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\nUsing a radiotherapy technique that minimises the dose to the lung and heart is likely to need a change in practice for many centres. There will be some impact on resources in order to implement this recommendation because additional training will be needed, and local protocols will need developing. However, the long-term impact on resources will be minimal: some additional planning time will be needed but there is no impact on the length or number of radiotherapy sessions.\nCurrently, deep inspiratory breath-hold radiotherapy techniques are not routinely offered to people with invasive breast cancer having whole-breast radiotherapy. However, the committee noted that the Royal College of Radiologists has produced consensus statements that advise using this technique, and that many centres already offer it. The recommendation will ensure consistent practice and ensure that people can access the best care.\n\n【100】 #Radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery\n\n【101】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThere is evidence that whole-breast radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery reduces the risk of recurrence and increases overall survival. It also decreases rates of depression and anxiety.\nHowever, because the risk of breast cancer recurring at 5 years is very low and there are harms associated with radiotherapy, the benefits of radiotherapy for women with a very low risk of recurrence are less certain. For these women, the committee agreed that healthcare professionals should fully discuss the benefits and risks with women before a decision is made.\nGood evidence showed that partial-breast radiotherapy led to similar results to whole-breast radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery in women with a low risk of local recurrence. In addition, it may have fewer treatment-related adverse effects. There was evidence for multicatheter interstitial brachytherapy, but this was not recommended because it is not currently available in England.\n\n【102】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\nMost women are already offered radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery so this reflects current practice, but more time may be needed to discuss the balance of benefits and risks with women.\nThe committee was aware that current practice for external beam partial-breast radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery is based on the Royal College of Radiologists' 2016 consensus statement, so there would be no change to recommended practice.\n\n【103】 #Radiotherapy after mastectomy\n\n【104】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThe committee agreed that adjuvant postmastectomy radiotherapy should be offered to people who have macroscopically node-positive invasive breast cancer or have involved resection margins. This is because the evidence showed a beneficial effect on survival and local recurrence. Although the evidence was limited and the committee acknowledged that radiotherapy is associated with lung and cardiac morbidity, they concluded that for this group of women, the benefits of radiotherapy outweigh the harms.\n\n【105】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\nThe committee agreed that the recommendations will reinforce current practice, so there would be little change in practice.\n\n【106】 #Dose fractionation of external beam radiotherapy\n\n【107】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThe committee noted that most centres use regimens of either 40 Gy in 15 fractions or 26 Gy in 5 fractions. However, there was variation between centres in which external beam hypofractionation regimen they used.\nThe evidence compared a number of different external beam hypofractionation regimens, but the committee focused on the evidence from 2 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared clinical effectiveness and safety, and a cost-effectiveness analysis, of the 2 hypofractionation regimens that are established in current practice (40 Gy in 15 fractions over 3 weeks and 26 Gy in 5 fractions over 1 week). High-quality to very low-quality evidence showed that the effects of both external beam hypofractionation regimens were comparable, with no clinically important differences between treatment arms for all-cause mortality, breast cancer-related mortality or disease recurrence. Economic evidence showed the 26 Gy in 5 fractions as an effective use of NHS resources compared with 40 Gy in 15 fractions and supported its use in current practice. In addition, the committee noted that in their experience, most people preferred to attend radiotherapy appointments over the course of 1 week rather than over 3 weeks for practical reasons related to fewer trips to the hospital (for example, reduced travelling time and costs, less time off work or from caring responsibilities). The committee recognised how the COVID-19 pandemic had also impacted current practice and had accelerated the change to implement the shorter 26 Gy in 5 fractions regimen.\nThe committee discussed the eligibility criteria for some of the trials in the evidence and noted that people who received nodal radiotherapy were excluded from the main study populations. They highlighted that there are particular concerns around adverse effects such as lymphoedema for people who received regional lymph node irradiation. The committee acknowledged that future trials and the FAST-Forward nodal sub-study results may address some of these concerns, but until further evidence is available the 40 Gy in 15 fractions regimen should continue to be used for this group.\n\n【108】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\nThe recommendations may reduce variation in practice, with most people being offered 26 Gy in 5 fractions rather than 40 Gy in 15 fractions. This is already current practice in many centres and will not have a major impact for those centres. In those centres where 26 Gy in 5 fractions is not yet current practice, there will be significant cost savings and capacity will be released for more appointments. For places where 40 Gy in 15 fractions is used more routinely, these recommendations may increase the number of people who are offered 26 Gy over 5 fractions. This will reduce the treatment duration and the costs associated with treatment.\n\n【109】 #Radiotherapy to nodal areas\n\n【110】 ## Why the committee made the recommendation\nThere was good evidence that radiotherapy to the internal mammary nodes reduced locoregional recurrence and improved survival. However, the committee took into account the potential for lung and heart toxicity, and agreed the importance of using a radiotherapy technique that minimises this risk.\n\n【111】 ## How the recommendation might affect practice\nThis recommendation is likely to need a change in practice for many centres. There will be some impact on resources in order to implement this recommendation because additional training will be needed, and local protocols will need developing. However, the long-term impact on resources will be minimal: some additional planning time will be needed but there is no impact on the length or number of radiotherapy sessions.\n\n【112】 #Neoadjuvant chemotherapy\n\n【113】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThere was good evidence to say that having chemotherapy before surgery (neoadjuvant chemotherapy) enables some women to have breast-conserving surgery who would otherwise have had total removal of their breast. The committee agreed that the response to neoadjuvant therapy could help guide the choice of subsequent adjuvant therapy.\n\n【114】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\nThe committee agreed that the recommendations would not result in a major change in practice because neoadjuvant chemotherapy is already offered in many centres. These recommendations will help improve consistency in practice.\n\n【115】 #Neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens\n11.5\n\n【116】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThere was evidence that platinum-containing neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens can improve pathological complete response rate and breast conservation rate in people with triple-negative invasive breast cancer. However, the committee took into account that platinum-containing regimens can cause anaemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and febrile neutropenia, as well as bone marrow problems and renal problems in older people. The committee agreed that healthcare professionals should have a full discussion with people about the benefits and risks of these regimens.\nThere was no evidence on people with the BRCA germline mutation, so the committee did not make separate recommendations for this subgroup.\n\n【117】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\nCurrently, platinum-containing neoadjuvant chemotherapy is not routinely offered to people with triple-negative early and locally advanced breast cancer, although the committee was aware that some centres may offer it. The recommendations will therefore bring a change in practice and will make practice more consistent across the NHS. The committee estimated that approximately 30% to 40% of people receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy may be affected by the recommendations.\n\n【118】 #Neoadjuvant endocrine therapy\n\n【119】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nFor postmenopausal women, there was some evidence that breast conservation rates, changes in tumour size and overall survival are the same with neoadjuvant endocrine therapy and neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Endocrine therapy is safer and has fewer side effects than chemotherapy, but there was not enough evidence to recommend endocrine therapy over chemotherapy for every woman. The committee agreed that healthcare professionals should discuss the potential benefits and risks with women to help them decide which treatment is right for them and that more research is needed to say whether neoadjuvant endocrine therapy is as effective as neoadjuvant chemotherapy.\nThe evidence for premenopausal women showed that neoadjuvant chemotherapy was more effective than endocrine therapy, but that endocrine therapy may be effective in some women. However, some women may prefer endocrine therapy because it is safer and has fewer side effects. Because of this, the committee agreed that healthcare professionals should discuss the potential benefits and risks with women to help them decide which treatment is right for them. The committee agreed that more research is needed on the long-term safety of neoadjuvant endocrine therapy, and to identify which premenopausal women will benefit from it. So, they made recommendations for research on the safety of neoadjuvant endocrine therapy in premenopausal women and postmenopausal women with early breast cancer.\n\n【120】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\nNeoadjuvant endocrine therapy is already being used, although there may be an increase in the number of people being offered it.\n\n【121】 #Radiotherapy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy\n\n【122】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThere was not enough evidence to recommend subgroups of women in whom postmastectomy radiotherapy could be safely omitted after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Therefore, the committee agreed that the recommendations for postmastectomy radiotherapy among people who have not received neoadjuvant chemotherapy applied to this population.\nPeople with node-negative T4 cancer were not included in this review because they are covered by the recommendation from the previous guideline which has been retained.\nWomen who respond well to neoadjuvant chemotherapy may derive less benefit from radiotherapy, but the committee agreed that further research was required to determine if the risks of radiotherapy outweighed the benefits in some women. So, they made a recommendation for research on the indications for postmastectomy radiotherapy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.\n\n【123】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\nThe committee noted that decisions about postmastectomy radiotherapy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy are currently based on pretreatment investigations, so there will be no change to practice.\n\n【124】 #Lymphoedema\n\n【125】 ## Why the committee made the recommendation\nGood evidence showed that there is no increased risk of lymphoedema associated with maintaining exercise levels after axillary intervention, so the committee agreed that people should not restrict or avoid physical activity.\nAlthough the evidence was limited and mixed, the committee concluded that there is no consistent evidence of increased risk of lymphoedema associated with air travel, travel to hot countries, manicures, hot-tub use, sports injuries, or medical procedures on the treated side.\n\n【126】 ## How the recommendation might affect practice\nAdvice about preventing lymphoedema is already being provided as part of routine care, so there is unlikely to be much change in practice. However, the recommendation will lead to greater consistency in the advice offered. It should also reduce inequality and improve the quality of standard care if people who have had axillary treatment need immunisations or elective procedures.\n\n【127】 #Arm and shoulder mobility\n\n【128】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThe committee noted there was very little high-quality evidence for any of the outcomes, and most of the evidence was low to very low quality. The committee agreed that they did not feel confident in making recommendations based on low-quality evidence from mainly single studies. Therefore, they used their clinical knowledge and experience alongside high-quality evidence from 1 UK-based RCT to support their decision making. This evidence showed improved outcomes with a physiotherapy-led structured supervised exercise programme in addition to usual care for reduction of pain, quality-of-life improvement and adherence to arm and shoulder exercises in people with a higher risk of developing shoulder problems. The trial provided all participants with information leaflets about exercises to help with arm and shoulder mobility after breast cancer surgery. This reflects standard practice in the UK, and the committee agreed it was important to reflect this advice in the recommendations. The recommendations also highlight that instructions on upper limb exercises and information should be discussed, explained and clarified with the person before radiotherapy begins, as the exercises should have been well established before starting treatment. The committee recommended that this should also happen before surgery.\nBased on the effectiveness of the intervention in the UK-based trial, the committee agreed that people who met the same criteria as those included in the trial should be identified as being at higher risk of developing shoulder problems. These people should then be offered supervised support to apply the exercises. The baseline shoulder identification of someone as high risk of developing shoulder problems could be done by a member of the clinical team (for example, a clinical nurse specialist) and could be done by looking at a person's medical history and asking the person if they have experienced any of the issues listed in the recommendation (for example, asking if they have stiffness of their shoulder or if the function of their shoulder is reduced). The evidence did not specify that these risk factors were only relevant to the affected side and the committee noted that people should be considered at high risk if they have any of the pre-existing shoulder conditions in the contralateral side. It was also highlighted that for most people radiotherapy to the axilla or supraclavicular nodes is decided before surgery. However, for some people this may be decided after postoperative pathology review. For this reason, they recommended that people who are identified as needing radiotherapy to the axilla or supraclavicular nodes after surgery should also be considered as being at higher risk of developing shoulder problems. This ensures that people would not miss out from supervised support if the need for radiotherapy was not identified before surgery.\nThe committee also agreed that, in their experience, other people having surgery for breast cancer who did not meet the high-risk criteria in the recommendations could benefit from supervised support. This includes, for example, people with learning or sensory disabilities, which could adversely affect their ability to carry out exercises without supervision and make them more likely to develop shoulder problems as a result. It also includes people having breast cancer surgery who have side effects from additional cancer treatments or who have other commonly performed adjunct surgeries in addition to breast cancer surgery, as well as people who are having radiotherapy without surgery.\n\n【129】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\nThere may be an increase in the number of people having supervised exercise or physiotherapy support after breast cancer surgery or before radiotherapy. However, if this could be delivered virtually (individual or group), it is likely to have a lower impact on NHS resources than in‑person 1‑to‑1 sessions and could free up resources for face-to-face interventions for those for whom virtual services are not appropriate or if there are barriers to them accessing virtual services.\n\n【130】 #Lifestyle\n14.2\n\n【131】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThere was evidence that both dietary changes (reducing fat intake and maintaining a healthy weight) and physical activity increase survival in people with invasive breast cancer.\nThere was some evidence that cancer recurrence is more likely in people who drink more than 3 or 4 alcoholic drinks per week or 6 g of alcohol per day. This equates to approximately 5 units of alcohol per week.\n\n【132】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\nThe committee discussed that many NHS services would already be advising people with breast cancer about the importance of a healthy lifestyle, and how they can make lifestyle changes to reduce the risk of recurrence. The committee agreed that these recommendations will help to direct conversations towards effective lifestyle changes. There will be no impact on resources because these discussions were already happening, and most of the lifestyle changes will be 'self-care' and implemented by patients themselves.\n\n【133】 This guideline updates and replaces the NICE guideline on early and locally advanced breast cancer (CG80). This is because new evidence was identified in surveillance that could affect recommendations, and has already changed clinical practice in some locations.\nPeople with symptoms that could be caused by breast cancer are referred by their GP to designated breast clinics in local hospitals . In addition, eligible women are invited for screening through the NHS Breast Screening Programme (NHSBSP) in England or the Breast Test Wales Screening Programme (BTWSP) in Wales. For most people, whether they are referred following breast screening or after presentation to a GP, diagnosis in the breast clinic is made by triple assessment (clinical assessment, mammography and/or ultrasound imaging, and core biopsy and/or fine-needle aspiration cytology). It is best practice to carry out these assessments at the same visit .\nBreast cancer is the most common cancer in the UK, with approximately 54,000 new cases of invasive disease and around 7,000 new cases of pre-invasive (in situ) disease diagnosed annually. Most of the breast cancers occur in women, but just over 300 men in the UK are also diagnosed with invasive breast cancer every year.\nMost breast cancers are diagnosed at an early stage and are therefore potentially curable with modern treatments. Survival rates have improved over recent decades with almost 90% of women diagnosed with breast cancer surviving their disease for 5 or more years after diagnosis. Survival is, however, linked to the stage of the disease at diagnosis; only 15% of women diagnosed with stage IV disease are alive at 5 years. Breast cancer remains the leading cause of death in women aged 35 to 49 years and is second only to lung cancer as the leading cause of cancer death in all women.\nAdults (18 and over) with:\nnewly diagnosed invasive adenocarcinoma of the breast of any size (T1 to T4), with or without spread to locoregional lymph nodes (N0 to N3) and with no distant metastases (M0)\nnewly diagnosed ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)\n\n【134】 invasive adenocarcinoma of the breast and distant metastases (clinical or pathological M1)\nrare breast tumours (for example, angiosarcoma or lymphoma)\nbenign breast tumours (for example, fibroadenoma)\nphyllodes tumour locally recurrent breast cancer or DCIS\nlobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS)\nno personal history of breast cancer and an increased risk of breast cancer due to family history.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

These views and conclusions are not necessarily those of the consultants, other federal agencies, and professional societies that reviewed the document, or of the contractor. recommends that employee exposure to ethylene dibromide in the workplace be controlled by adherence to the following sections.\n\n【1】 #CRITERIA DOCUMENT: RECOMMENDATIONS FOR AN OCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURE STANDARD FOR ETHYLENE DIBROMIDE\nThe standard is designed to protect the health and provide for the safety of employees for up to a 10-hour workday, 40-hour workweek, over a working lifetime.\nCompliance with all sections of the standard should prevent adverse effects of ethylene dibromide on the health of employees and provide for their safety. Techniques recommended in the standard are valid, reproducible, and available to industry and government agencies. Sufficient technology exists to permit compliance with the recommended standard. Although NIOSH considers the workplace environmental limit to be a safe level based on current information, the employer should regard it as the upper boundary of exposure and make every effort to maintain the exposure as low as is technically feasible. The criteria and standard will be subject to review and revision as necessary.\nThe possible health effects of employees chronically exposed to ethylene dibromide may include the induction of cancers, malformations and heritable changes in offspring, and sterility. Ethylene dibromide may also cause adverse effects to the liver, kidneys, heart, and other internal organs and systems. Direct contact of the skin with ethylene dibromide may induce chemical burns as well as systemic effects, and ingestion of ethylene dibromide may damage internal organ systems, or even be fatal.\nThe alkylation of cellular constituents, including the genetic material, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), is the most plausible molecular basis for the induction of adverse effects after exposure to ethylene dibromide.\n\"Occupational exposure to ethylene dibromide\" is defined as work in any establishment where ethylene dibromide is manufactured, blended, stored, used, handled, or otherwise present. The \"action level\" is defined as one-half of the recommended workplace exposure concentration designated as a ceiling limit for ethylene dibromide If exposure to other chemicals also occurs, the employer shall comply with any applicable standard for the other chemicals.\n\n【2】 The employer shall control workplace concentrations of ethylene dibromide so that no employee is exposed in his workplace to concentrations greater than 1.0 mg/cu m (0.13 ppm) as a ceiling limit, as determined by a sampling period of 15 minutes.\n(b)\n\n【3】 #Sampling and Analysis\nProcedures for the collection and analysis of workroom air samples for compliance with the standard shall be as provided in Appendices I and II, or by any methods shown to be at least equivalent in precision, sensitivity, and accuracy to the methods specified.\n\n【4】 Medical surveillance shall be made available to employees as outlined below:\n(a) Comprehensive preplacement and annual medical examinations unless a more frequent schedule is indicated by professional medical judgment based on such factors as emergencies, variations in work periods, and the preexisting health status of the individual worker.\n(b) These examinations shall include at least:\nComprehensive or interim medical and work histories, with special emphasis directed to disorders of the heart, liver, kidneys, and nervous system.\nA comprehensive physical examination, with particular emphasis given to cardiovascular, pulmonary, neurologic, hepatic, and renal systems, and to the skin.\nAn evaluation of the employee's physical ability to safely wear a negative or positive pressure respirator.\nThe relevancy of these findings in animals to male or female employees has not yet been established. They do indicate, however, that both employers and employees should do everything possible to minimize exposures to ethylene dibromide. If a physician becomes aware of any adverse effects on the reproductive system, or cancers in individuals who have been exposed to ethylene dibromide, or any abnormal babies born to parents either or both of whom have been exposed to ethylene dibromide, such information should be forwarded to the Director, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, as promptly as possible.\n(d) Medical attention shall be provided promptly to all employees suspected of being exposed to ethylene dibromide vapor at or above the action level or to liquid ethylene dibromide.\nA 48-hour medical observation period for delayed systemic or dermal effects is recommended.\n(e) Examinations of current employees shall be performed as soon as practicable after the promulgation of a standard based on these recommendations.\n(f) The employer shall maintain medical records for all persons exposed to ethylene dibromide at or above the action level.\nAll medical records, including information on required medical examinations and supporting documents, shall be kept for at least 30 years after the termination of the individual's employment.\n(g) The medical representatives of the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, of the Secretary of Labor, of the employee or former employee, and of the employer shall have access to these medical records.\n\n【5】 All labels and warning signs shall be printed both in English and in the predominant language of non-English-reading workers. Illiterate workers and workers reading languages other than those used on labels and posted signs shall receive information regarding hazardous areas and shall be informed of the instructions printed on labels and signs.\n(a) Labeling\nThe following warning label shall be affixed in a readily visible location on ethylene dibromide processing or other equipment and on ethylene dibromide storage tanks or containers:  (C) During emergencies when air concentrations of ethylene dibromide may exceed the recommended occupational exposure limit.\nETHYLENE\n\n【6】 #C2\n\n【7】 (A)\nThe employer shall ensure that no employee is exposed to ethylene dibromide because of improper respirator selection, fit, use, or maintenance.\n(B) The employer shall establish and enforce a respirator program meeting the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.134 as amended.\n\n【8】 (D) Respiratory protective devices described in Supplied-air respirator with full facepiece, helmet, or hood  Self-contained breathing appara tus with full facepiece Type C supplied-air respirator with full facepiece operated in pressuredemand or other positive pressure mode or with full facepiece, hood, or hel met operated in continuous-flow mode\nSelf-contained breathing appara tus with full facepiece operated in pressure-demand or other positive pressure mode  Combination respirator that in cludes Type C supplied-air respirator with full facepiece operated in pressure-demand or other positive pressure or continuous-flow mode and auxiliary self-contained breathing apparatus op erated in pressure-demand or positive pressure mode  Supplied-air suits may be neces sary (b)\nEye Protection\nEye protective devices shall be provided by the employer and used by each employee where contact of ethylene dibromide with the eyes is likely.\nChemical safety goggles or plastic face shields (8-inch minimum) with goggles made completely of ethylene dibromide-resistant materials shall be used. Selection, use, and maintenance of eye protective devices shall be in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.133.\n(c) Protective Clothing\nProtective clothing shall be resistant to the penetration and to the chemical action of ethylene dibromide. Additional protection, including gloves, bib-type aprons, boots, and overshoes, shall be provided for, and worn by, each employee while in any operation that may cause direct contact with liquid ethylene dibromide. Supplied-air hoods or suits resistant to penetration by ethylene dibromide shall be worn when entering confined spaces, such as pits or storage tanks. In situations where heat stress is likely to occur, supplied-air suits, preferably cooled, are recommended.\nThe employer shall ensure that all personal protective clothing is inspected regularly for defects and is maintained in a clean and satisfactory condition by the employee. Records of such training should be kept for inspection by authorized personnel as required. This program shall be held for all employees with occupational exposure to ethylene dibromide at intervals not greater than quarterly, or whenever there is a process change. For all work areas where emergencies may occur, the employer shall take all necessary steps to ensure that employees are instructed in and follow the procedures specified below and any others appropriate to the specific operation or process.\nProcedures shall include at least prearranged plans for :\nEvacuation alarm systems shall be provided by the employer.\n\n【9】 Nonessential employees shall be evacuated from hazardous areas during emergencies. Perimeters of these areas shall be delineated, posted, and secured. The employees in adjacent areas shall be trained in evacuation procedures if these work areas become involved.\n\n【10】 #C5\nOnly personnel trained in the emergency procedures and protected against the attendant hazards shall shut off sources of ethylene dibromide, clean up spills, control and repair leaks, and fight fires in ethylene dibromide areas.\nFirefighting procedures shall be established for areas where flammable materials are used with ethylene dibromide. Chemical foam, carbon dioxide, or dry chemicals shall be used for fighting fires in areas where ethylene dibromide is present.\nProper protective respirators and clothing shall be worn by all personnel in the hazard area until concentrations of airborne ethylene dibromide have been demonstrated by monitoring to be below the recommended occupational exposure limit.\nShowers, eyewash fountains, and washroom facilities shall be provided and so located as to be readily accessible to workers in all areas where skin or eye contact with liquid ethylene dibromide is likely. If liquid ethylene dibromide is splashed on the clothing or skin, contaminated clothing shall be promptly removed and the skin washed thoroughly with soap and water for at least 15 minutes. If liquid ethylene dibromide gets into the eyes, they shall be irrigated immediately with copious quantities of running water for at least 15 minutes The use of completely enclosed processes is the recommended method of control for ethylene dibromide. Local exhaust ventilation may also be effective, used alone or in combination with process enclosure. When a local exhaust ventilation system is used, it shall be designed to prevent the accumulation or recirculation of ventilation control or process air in the workroom, to maintain ethylene dibromide concentrations below the limit of the recommended standard, and to remove ethylene dibromide from the breathing zones of employees. Exhaust systems discharging into outside air must conform with applicable local, state, and federal air pollution regulations. Ventilation systems shall be subjected to regular preventive maintenance and cleaning to ensure effectiveness, which shall be verified by periodic airflow measurements at least every 3 months. Measurements of system efficiency shall also be made immediately by personnel properly attired in specified protective equipment when any change in production, process, or control might result in increased concentrations of airborne ethylene dibromide. Tempered makeup air shall be provided to work areas in which exhaust ventilation is operating.\nForced-draft ventilation systems shall be equipped with remote manual controls and shall be designed to turn off automatically in the event of a fire in the work area.\n\n【11】 #C2\nPrompt medical attention shall be provided if there is known or suspected exposure to ethylene dibromide, whether or not symptoms are present.\n\n【12】 #C3\nThe employer shall ensure that safety showers, eyewash fountains, and other emergency equipment is in proper working order through regularly scheduled inspections performed by qualified maintenance personnel.\nEthylene dibromide operating systems shall be inspected daily for signs of leaks by personnel attired in specified protective equipment. All equipment including valves, fittings, and connections shall be checked for tightness and good working order. All newly made connections shall be checked for leaks immediately after ethylene dibromide is introduced by trained personnel attired in prescribed personal protective equipment.\nIf there is a leak, the leak shall be corrected immediately. Work shall resume normally only after necessary repair or replacement has been completed, the area has been ventilated, and the concentration of ethylene dibromide has been determined by monitoring to be below the recommended occupational exposure limit.\nTransportation and use of ethylene dibromide shall comply with all applicable local, state, and federal regulations. Where ethylene dibromide is used as a fumigant, strict adherence to the pesticide container label requirements for application and personal protection shall be followed. Additional standards for pesticide use by agricultural workers can be found in 40 CFR 170.  When ethylene dibromide containers are being moved, or when they are not in use and are disconnected, valve protection covers shall be in place.\nContainers shall be moved only with the proper equipment and shall be secured to prevent dropping or loss of control while moving.\nProcess valves and pumps shall be readily accessible and should not be located in pits and congested areas.\nContainers and systems shall be handled and opened with care Adequate ventilation shall be available to prevent exposure to ethylene dibromide when opening containers and systems.\nPersonnel shall work in teams when ethylene dibromide is first admitted to a system, while repairing leaks, or when entering a confined or enclosed space.\nAny odor of ethylene dibromide shall be reported to a responsible authority and an alarm sounded immediately.\n\n【13】 #(d) Work Areas  Ethylene Dibromide Hazard Areas\nA hazard area shall be considered as any space workers may enter that has physical characteristics and sources of ethylene dibromide that could result in air concentrations exceeding the recommended limit.\nExits shall be plainly marked and shall open outward. Emergency exit doors shall be conveniently located and shall open into areas which will remain free of contamination in an emergency. At least two separate means of exit shall be provided from each room or building in which ethylene dibromide is stored, handled, or used in quantities that could create a hazard.\n\n【14】 #Confined or Enclosed Spaces\nEntry into confined spaces, such as tanks, pits, process vessels, tank cars, sewers, or tunnels, where there may be limited egress shall be controlled by a permit system. Permits shall be signed by an authorized employer representative certifying that preventive and protective measures have been followed.\nConfined spaces which have contained ethylene dibromide shall be thoroughly ventilated to ensure an adequate supply of oxygen, tested for ethylene dibromide and other contaminants, and inspected for compliance with these requirements prior to each entry. Adequate ventilation shall be maintained while workers are in the space. Leakage of ethylene dibromide into the confined space while work is in progress shall be prevented by disconnecting and blanking the ethylene dibromide supply lines. An individual entering confined spaces shall be furnished with appropriate personal protective equipment and protected by a lifeline harness tended by another worker outside the space, who shall also be equipped for entry with approved personal protective equipment and who has contact with a third party. Communication (visual, voice, signal line, telephone, radio, or other suitable means) shall be maintained by the standby person with the employee inside the confined or enclosed space. A third employee, equipped to proceed to the aid of the other two if necessary, shall have general surveillance of their activities.\n(e) Storage\nStorage facilities shall be designed to contain spills completely within a surrounding dike and to prevent contamination of workroom air.\nStorage of ethylene dibromlde in the same area as reactive metals, such as aluminum or magnesium, or as liquid ammonia shall be prohibited.\nEthylene dibromide shall be stored in tightly closed containers in a well-ventilated area away from excessive heat and sunlight.\n\n【15】 #C4\nStorage containers shall be periodically inspected for leakage.\nVentilation switches and emergency respiratory equipment shall be located outside storage areas in readily accessible locations which will be free of ethylene dibromide in an emergency.\n(f) Spills, Leaks, and Waste Disposal\nIf ethylene dibromide leaks or is spilled, the following steps shall be taken:\n(A) Evacuate all nonessential personnel from the area.\n\n【16】 #(B)\nAdequately ventilate the area of the spill or leak to prevent accumulation of the vapor.\n(C) If in liquid form, collect spilled material for reclamation or absorb in vermiculite, dry sand, earth, or similar nonreactive material.\n(D) If in solid form, collect spilled material in the most convenient and safe manner for reclamation or for disposal.\nPersonnel entering the spill or leak area shall be furnished with appropriate personal protective equipment. All other personnel shall be excluded from the area.\nAll wastes and residues containing ethylene dibromide shall be collected in ethylene dibromide-resistant containers and incinerated or buried in such a manner that no ethylene dibromide or toxic decomposition products are released to the environment. Clothing contaminated with liquid ethylene dibromide shall be immediately removed and placed in a closed container in a well-ventilated area for later disposal or decontamination. Employers shall require personnel who work with ethylene dibromide to shower before leaving the workplace at the end of a workday.\n(c) Employers shall ensure that employees who handle ethylene dibromide wash their hands thoroughly with soap and water before eating, smoking, or using toilet facilities.\n\n【17】 #(d)\nThe storage, dispensing, preparation, and consumption of food, beverages, or tobacco shall be prohibited in ethylene dibromide work areas.\n(e)\nThe employer shall ensure that personnel who launder and clean clothing or equipment contaminated with ethylene dibromide are provided adequate personal protective equipment to prevent exposure and shall ensure that these employees are aware of the potential hazards of exposure to ethylene dibromide. where ethylene dibromide is handled, processed, or stored. Records of these surveys, including the basis for concluding that environmental concentrations are below the recommended limit or below the action level, shall be maintained. Surveys shall be repeated every month or whenever a process change is made.\n(b) Where exposure concentrations have not been determined, they shall be determined as soon as practicable after the promulgation of a standard based on these recommendations.\n\n【18】 #(c)\nRequirements set forth below apply to work areas in which the concentration of ethylene dibromide has been determined to be at or above the action level.\n\n【19】 Environmental samples shall be taken when a new process is installed or process changes are made which may cause an increase in environmental concentrations. Significantly increased production, relocation of existing operations, interruption of normal maintenance schedules, or other functions which may increase ethylene dibromide concentrations shall require resampling and analysis.\n\n【20】 If initial, periodic, or special evaluations indicate that the recommended limit is exceeded, corrective engineering or other control measures shall be immediately instituted to ensure the safety of employees until a concentration below the recommended occupational exposure limit is achieved.\nIn such cases, sampling of each operation and work location shall be conducted at least weekly until two consecutive employee exposure measurements, taken at least 1 week apart, reveal that the employee is not exposed to ethylene dibromide above the recommended occupational exposure limit. Employers shall notify in writing, within 5 days, every employee who is found to be exposed to ethylene dibromide above the recommended environmental limit. Adherence to the recommended standard for occupational exposure to ethylene dibromide is intended to minimize the potentials for the induction of sterility, carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, or teratogenesis in employees and their offspring from exposure to ethylene dibromide in the workplace.\nAdherence to the recommended standard is also intended to minimize the hazards from skin penetration and irritation associated with exposure to liquid ethylene dibromide and the delayed and insidious long-term systemic effects resulting from exposure to bath liquid and vaporous ethylene dibromide.\nIII.\n\n【21】 #BIOLOGIC EFFECTS OF EXPOSURE\nEthylene dlbromide, also known as 1,2-dibromoethane and ethylene bromide, is a clear, colorless, heavy liquid at room temperature with a distinctive odor described as \"characteristic, mildly sweet\" . The minimum concentrations of ethylene dibromide in air reported to be detectable by odor range from 10 ppm (77 mg/cu m)  to 25 ppm (192.5 mg/cu m) .\nIt tends to react with nucleophilic organic compounds  more readily with those that are relatively easily polarized, such as those containing sulfhydryl or amino groups, than with those that are less readily polarized, such as acids and ketones.\nThe half-life of ethylene dibromide in water at 20 C and at a pH of 7 is about 14 years .\nAlthough the biologic half-life of ethylene dibromide in humans is unknown, the presence of large numbers of nucleophiles in biologic tissue suggests that the half-life would be considerably shorter than that in water. The approximate biologic halflife of ethylene dibromide after intravenous (iv) injection in rats was less than 2 hours, and in chicks, it was less than 12 hours . An approximate biologic half-life of 14C-labeled ethylene dibromide in mice and in guinea pigs can be estimated from the data presented by Edwards et al  and Plotnick and Conner  as less than 48 hours. This indicates that either spontaneous reactions with nucleophiles, enzymatically catalyzed degradative reactions, or efficient excretory mechanisms predominate in biologic systems.\nThe covalent reaction of ethylene dibromide with biologic materials may alter the chemical behavior and physical characteristics of the cellular constituents so as to prevent the altered molecules from functioning normally in physiologic processes. The formation of stable reaction products may account, in part, for the subsequent deleterious effects observed in biologic systems exposed to ethylene dibromide. The alkylation by foreign chemicals of the biologic materials controlling cellular metabolism is the most plausible basis for the induction of genetic and neoplastic alterations after the exposure of biologic populations to alkylating agents. When the risk of induction of adverse biologic changes, such as mutation and neoplasia, increase as a cumulative function of the total dosage, then the observation of measurable effects may not be possible until after long periods of exposure to low concentrations of the inducing agent .\n\n【22】 #Extent of Exposure\nEthylene dibromide-manufacturing processes are based on the bromination of ethylene . Natural bromide-containing brines are treated with chlorine to release elemental bromine through anionic replacement.\nThe reaction between gaseous ethylene and liquid bromine (which may contain traces of chlorine) yields a mixture of ethylene dibromide and reaction side-products, including very small amounts of vinyl bromide, ethyl bromide, and ethyl chlorobromide . If the reaction temperatures and pressures are carefully controlled, the purity of the ethylene dibromide can approach 99.95% . Ethylene dibromide can also be produced by the hydrobromination of acetylene , although this process is of little commercial value today.\nIn 1921, the antiknock properties of tetraalkyl lead compounds in the internal combustion engine were discovered . To prevent the deposition of lead on the cylinder walls, a substance capable of reacting with the lead to aid its removal from the engine was needed. Ethylene dibromide was found to be such a substance and has been used since then in leaded gasoline as a lead scavenger.\nThe US production of ethylene dibromide increased from an estimated 64 million pounds in 1940 to over 331 million pounds in 1973 . This fivefold increase can be related to the increased consumption of gasoline containing ethylene dibromide as an additive, which has always been its largest use . About 85% of the ethylene dibromide produced during the The production of ethylene dibromide is the largest single use of bromine, and, as such, the locations of manufacturing plants have usually been near the major sources of bromine . Until 1961, the major source of bromine for ethylene dibromide manufacture was seawater; since 1961, the major source of bromine has been underground brine deposits, and the manufacturing of ethylene dibromide has been redistributed to be near these natural bromide brine wells in Michigan and Arkansas .\nlast\nNIOSH estimates that approximately 9,000 employees (manufacturing, formulating, fumigating) are potentially exposed to ethylene dibromide in the workplace.\n\n【23】 #Historical Reports\nOne of the first instances of ethylene dibromide intoxication was described by Marmetschke  in 1910. This case history described the accidental use of ethylene dibromide instead of ethyl bromide as an anesthetic or narcotic agent. Although this report is historical rather than clinical, it is one of the few relating to human exposure which give the amount of ethylene dibromide administered to each patient and the clinical symptoms resulting from the exposures\nAnother early case of occupational exposure to ethylene dibromide, which will also be discussed in Effects on Humans, was described in 1928 by Kochmann .\n\n【24】 #Effects on Humans\nIn 1910, Marmetschke  wrote about a case of ethylene dibromide poisoning that occurred as the result of the mistaken administration of ethylene dibromide to a patient instead of ethyl bromide. A woman was administered the contents of a 70-g bottle of ethylene dibromide in aliquots of about 10 ml (22.0 g) through a gauze mask without producing the expected anesthesia. She coughed constantly during the administration and was dizzy at the completion of the application. She began to vomit and continued vomiting throughout the night.\nThe patient complained of a burning sensation in her chest and of inability to sleep. During the night, she had diarrhea, and the next day she became dizzy again after exertion. She became very restless and nervous and complained of having trouble in breathing. She continued to complain of thirst, abdominal pain, and a burning sensation in her chest.\nThe next day, she had uterine hemorrhaging, and died approximately 44 hours after she received the ethylene dibromide.\nTwo hours later, the hands were washed with soap and water. None of the subjects developed any symptoms of adverse effects on the day of the test or later. Pflesser observed that, after rubbing the fluid between the hands for 1 minute, the liquid could no longer be seen on the skin, and he concluded that it had been absorbed or had evaporated.\nIn an additional experiment , the same volunteers rubbed 1 ml of the gauge fluid into the skin of the right forearm for 1 minute. Again, washing with soap and water was done after 2 hours. No symptoms of irritation were seen immediately after the exposure or later.\nDuring the next 12 hours, a severe burning pain developed in addition to small blisters which merged into large ones.\nThe blisters initially contained a clear, amber-yellow, thick liquid, but the liquid had a pronounced tendency to coagulate because of its high protein content. The area immediately surrounding the application site was edematous and swollen, and, in some cases, the swelling extended from the fingertips to the upper arm. In one case, the axillary lymph nodes were moderately swollen and painful. Even with topical cod liver oil treatment, the skin did not grow back until 13-17 days after exposure, and surface scars persisted for at least 4 months. Pflesser  stated that all subjects felt severely ill during the first days following exposure. In two subjects, dermatitis, consisting of severe swelling and reddening of the skin accompanied by intensive itching, persisted in the area of the application for several weeks.\nTo determine which component of the gauge fluid was responsible for the adverse effects on the skin, Pflesser  subjected the same eight subjects and himself to each of the individual components. The results of the tests with the paraffin oil, Sudan Red B, and tetrachlorethane were negative.\nDuring the 1-hour exposure to 0.5 ml of tetrachlorethane, several individuals noted a slight sensation of heat at the application site, but no symptoms similar to those for the gauge fluid were subsequently noted. All volunteers rubbed 0.5 ml (1.1 g) of ethylene dibromide into the skin of the forearm for 1 minute and washed with soap and water 30 minutes later. All subjects developed swelling and reddening of the exposed area, as well as itching, during the 24 hours immediately after exposure. The symptoms subsided without supportive treatment within 2-3 days.\nFrom this series of experiments, Pflesser  concluded that ethylene dibromide was the component of the gauge fluid that was responsible for the swelling, reddening, and blistering of the skin of the seaman on the destroyer. He also concluded that the effects and their intensities depended on the duration of exposure to the skin, and that covering the application site to prevent evaporation greatly increased the extent of damage from exposure. Pflesser concluded that ethylene dibromide was absorbed through the skin, causing tissue death, general inflammation, and plasma exudation. He further postulated that ethylene dibromide possessed a sensitization potential, citing the symptoms that appeared at previous application sites after his own exposure for 3 minutes to 0.5 ml of ethylene dibromide as proof of the assumption.\nThomas and Yant  noted that commercial and purified ethylene dibromide applied to the shaved abdomens of three groups of two rats each over a 2-cm square area killed all of the animals within 6-18 hours at doses of 0.25, 0.50, or 1.00 ml (0.55, 1.1, or 2.2 g)/animal. No attempt was made to determine the minimum lethal dose. The application site showed marked hyperemia of the small cutaneous blood vessels, and the abdominal muscles became contracted and remained tense. By 20 minutes, the reflexes became weak and the animals were scarcely able to stand. A slight, temporary increase in activity was noted during the next 10 minutes, but the general appearance remained that of great weakness. Macroscopic and microscopic examinations of tissues were similar to those in guinea pigs after vapor inhalation. The only difference observed between the two routes of exposure concerned the spleen: gross examination of the guinea pigs exposed to the vapor of airborne ethylene dibromide revealed that spleens were pale and edematous, whereas spleens of the dermally exposed rats were highly congested and edematous. No microscopic characterization of these differences was given.\nRespiration became extremely rapid during exposure and there was considerable phonation. The mucous membranes of the mouth were a peculiar \"old rose\" color after recovery from the anesthesia. This may have been due to a combination of vascular congestion and cyanosis. Death occurred within 18 hours, and, at autopsy, the liver was enlarged and mottled.\nMicroscopic examination of the liver showed slight-to-moderate diffuse fatty changes, which tended to be more marked in the portal regions.\nAnother rabbit deeply anesthetized by inhalation of ethylene dibromide for about 12 minutes exhibited signs of marked irritation from the gas, considerable phonation, rapid breathing progressing as the anesthesia continued, and snuffling in its breathing after recovery from the anesthesia . Death occurred within 15 hours. Autopsy showed the lungs to be enlarged and filled with a frothy exudate. About 10 ml of fluid was found in the pleural cavity. The liver was swollen and markedly congested. Lucas postulated that these results may have been caused by the decomposition of ethylene dibromide to hydrogen bromide and that local high concentrations of this material would be sufficient to bring about the observed changes. The next day, the animals began to tremble while in the cage, tears began forming, and the nasal mucosa was strongly reddened. After 11 exposures, the survivors were very weak and maintained a reclining posture, and strong trembling was observed, especially in the extremities. These conditions persisted until death occurred. There was a general weight loss during the exposures. Autopsy showed that the body cavities contained a clear, yellowish liquid. The lungs contained dark red discolorations and were judged by the author to be partially nonfunctional. The spleen was slightly enlarged and the kidneys were swollen and yellow colored.\nKochmann diagnosed the condition of the cats after exposure to ethylene dibromide as follows: rhinitis, conjunctivitis, ascites, pleural effusion, pneumonia in the left superior lobe of the lung, and incipient fatty degeneration of the liver and possibly degeneration of the tubules of the kidneys. Similar adverse signs of intoxication, including rhinitis, conjunctivitis, anorexia, and loss of weight, appeared in rabbits.\nAutopsies of the rabbits showed that the small intestine contained an excessive amount of liquid, that the colon contained blood, and that the liver and kidneys were hyperemic.\nIn an additional experiment, the animals inhaled ethylene dibromide at a concentration of 0.01% (770 mg/cu m) once for 30 minutes, and the author  noted that there was a reduction in appetite, a corresponding loss of weight, a distinctly reduced hemoglobin content in the blood, and a slow recovery to the pretreatment conditions of the test animals. disappeared immediately after the guinea pigs were removed from the exposure chamber. Paralysis of the rear extremities occurred 24 hours after the sixth exposure, but it had partially disappeared after 5 additional days and was completely gone after another 8 days. The authors concluded that the adverse effects, such as paralysis of the extremities and spasms of the diaphragm, appeared at a lower concentration and in a much shorter time than did the adverse effects in a concurrent experiment with methyl bromide. They also concluded that the signs of toxicity remained longer than those observed from methyl bromide.\nMarked decreases in respiratory rate, blood pressure, and muscle reflexes resulted.\nEthylene dibromide at 0.3 ml (0.66 g) injected iv caused cessation of respiration which was \"momentary\" or lasted as long as 40 seconds in the dogs tested. The cessation was followed by panting and a gradual return to almost normal breathing rate. The same dose produced a 75% decrease in blood pressure, the fall being immediate and sharp. The blood pressure gradually returned toward normal in a period of 2-12 minutes; but, in some cases, it remained 30% below normal. Ethylene dibromide at doses of 0.1-0.3 ml (0.22-0.66 g) injected iv caused a profound and rapid depression of the knee jerk reflex, which never returned to normal after the exposure.\nThe investigators The autopsy showed bronchopneumonic foci and severe hyperemia in both lungs.\nA spherical thrombus was found in the heart, and the liver showed pronounced fatty degeneration.\nNo cardiac arrest or change in the heart rate was found at a concentration of 200 ppm of ethylene dibromide.\nFifty-five female rabbits, 28 chicks, 40 male and female guinea pigs, 40 female rats, 60 male rats, and 20 female mice were administered ethylene dibromide at sufficient doses to enable calculation of single oral-dose LD50's of 55 mg/kg, 79 mg/kg, 110 mg/kg, 117 mg/kg, 146 mg/kg, and 420 mg/kg, respectively . The LD50's for male and female rats were significantly different (P<0.05). Of the five species tested, rabbits were the most sensitive to ethylene dibromide and mice were the least sensitive.\nRowe et al  found that undiluted ethylene dibromide promptly caused obvious pain and conlunctival irritation when introduced into the eyes of rabbits. The undiluted material was in contact with the eyes for 30 seconds before one eye was thoroughly flushed for 3 minutes with running water; the other eye was not washed. Both eyes of each rabbit were then observed for injury. The conjunctival irritation cleared within 48 hours, and a very slight amount of superficial necrosis of the cornea healed promptly and completely. When a 10% solution of ethylene dibromide in propylene glycol was tested in rabbits bv the same procedure used with the undiluted material, it produced a more severe response than did the undiluted material. Moderate conjunctival irritation developed within 2 hours and persisted for 48 hours before remission began to occur.\nModerate-to-severe corneal injury also persisted for about 48 hours before tissue repair became evident. Healing was complete 12 days after exposure without corneal scarring being evident. No injury to the iris or the lens of the eye was noted. A 1% solution in propylene glycol elicited a response in the rabbit eye very similar to that of the undiluted material.\nThe authors noted that prompt washing of the treated eyes had a beneficial effect in all cases, slightly reducing the intensity of the response and shortening the healing time.\nApplication of undiluted ethylene dibromide or 10% solutions in butyl carbitol acetate to the shaved skins of rabbits killed the animals within 24 hours . It was apparent that a few hours of confined contact of the material with the skin caused marked erythema and edema. When evaporation was not inhibited by a covering, only slight erythema was noted. A 1.0% solution of ethylene dibromide in butyl carbitol acetate applied to rabbit ears 10 times in 14 days caused only slight erythema and exfoliation. When the solution was applied repeatedly for 10 times in 14 days onto the shaved abdomen of the rabbit and then bandaged, marked erythema and edema, which progressed to necrosis and exfoliation, were observed. Healing was complete without scarring within 7 days after termination of both exposures.\nThese investigators  also studied the effects of single exposures of ethylene dibromide vapor to groups of 4-30 rats of both sexes at concentrations of 100, 200, 400, 800, 1,600, 3,000, 5,000, or 10,000 ppm  for 7 hours lived.\nRowe et al  subjected rabbits, monkeys, guinea pigs, and rats to Two groups of controls, well-matched with the experimental animals with respect to number, age, sex, and body weight, were used in the experiment.\nOne group was exposed to the same experimental regimen as the group exposed to ethylene dibromide, but in a chamber ventilated with clean air. The second control group was simply maintained in the animal quarters.\nGroups of 8 male and 8 female guinea pigs tolerated 145 7-hour exposures at 25 ppm (192.5 mg/cu m) in 205 days without evidence of adverse effects as judged by the same criteria used to evaluate the rat data, except that liver lipid determinations were not conducted. Mortality during the experiment, caused by pulmonary infections, was 50% in male and 25% in female guinea pigs exposed to ethylene dibromide. Eighteen of the 20 animals in both the male and female control groups exposed to clean air survived the experimental regimen, but only 7 and 8 of the 20 females and males, respectively, in the unexposed control groups survived. An additional group of 8 female guinea pigs received 13 7-hour exposures at 25 ppm (192.5 mg/cu m) in 17 days without exhibiting adverse effects.\nRabbits, 3 male and 1 female, and monkeys, 1 male and 1 female, were subjected to 152 7-hour exposures in 214 days and 156 7-hour exposures in 220 days, respectively, at 25 ppm (192.5 mg/cu m ) . There were no signs of adverse effects in the rabbits and monkeys when judged by the above criteria for the guinea pig data. Since an unusually high mortality rate was observed in the nonexposed control rats but not in the air-exposed control animals, no decisive conclusions can be drawn from the published data with respect to the hazard resulting from exposure to ethylene dibromide at 25 ppm (192.5 mg/cu m ) .\nAt concentrations of 100 ppm (770 mg/cu m) of ethylene dibromide vapor, 10 female rats steadily lost weight and 3 died after 1, 5, and 7 exposures, respectively, for 7 hours/day . The remaining rats appeared thin and unkempt at the time of autopsy after seven exposures in 9 days.\nStudies to determine whether the reproductive impairment was prolonged after repeated removal and reinstatement of ethylene dibromide diets were not conducted. However, in the one bull that was reexposed after a period of discontinuation, the time necessary for recovery of normal spermatozoic production increased from 10 days after the first discontinuation to 2-3 months after the second.\nIn Eleven bulls (D Amir, written communication, August 1976) given ethylene dibromide in olive oil were 15-24 months of age and weighed 400-500 kg.\nattributed the distributional pattern of abnormal spermatozoa in the genital tract to the variation in the time of release of the spermatozoa through the ductus deferens caused by individual variations in the doseresponse threshold of the bulls.\nIn 3 weeks. They also observed that hens that had ceased egg production could not be induced to lay again by feeding them a bromide-free diet, even after feeding continued for several months.\nTo determine the effects of small amounts of ethylene dibromide in grain on egg laying, the authors  subjected 4 groups of 16 6-month-old hens each at concentrations of ethylene dibromide in grain ranging from 0 to 30 ppm (total ration concentrations of 0-15 ppm). In addition to the ethylene dibromide, small amounts of \"residual bromide,\" defined as the bromine-containing material remaining in sorghum grain that had been fumigated with ethylene dibromide and then aerated to remove free ethylene Sixty 1-day-old female chicks were divided equally into two groups, the first was fed twice daily a commercial mash containing 40 ppm of ethylene dibromide and the second served as controls in a paired-feeding design.\nWeights and feed consumption were recorded weekly up to 10 weeks of age.\nFeed intake, weight gain, onset of egg production at 4.5-5 months, and incidence of double-yolked eggs were the same for the experimental and control groups.\nSimilarly, a third experiment  was conducted to determine the effects of ethylene dibromide on male chicken growth rate and sexual development.\nThree groups of 20 3-day-old cockerels were fed mash containing 0, 80, or 180 ppm of ethylene dibromide in which the amount of feed intake by the 180-ppm group determined the amounts of food given to the control and 80-ppm groups. Three additional groups of 25 cockerels were each fed mash containing 0, 150, or 300 ppm of ethylene dibromide without restrictions on the intake. At 6 weeks, the cockerels fed 150 ppm of ethylene dibromide showed a reduced weight gain when compared with the controls. Only cockerels fed the 300-ppm ethylene dibromide diet without restrictions on food intake showed significant growth retardation and an apparent feed intake depression at 12 weeks of age; however, the weight gain to feed intake ratio was not significantly different. The cockerels receiving the regulated diets were killed at 3 months of age, and the bromide content of the testes, spermatozoic count and activity, and testes weight were determined. Significant amounts of bromide were found in the testes of the ethylene dibromide-fed groups, but differences were not observed in spermiogenic activity, spermatozoic count, or testes weight between the control and ethylene dibromide-fed groups. The remaining unrestricted-intake cockerel groups were examined at the age of 9 months by collecting semen samples three times at weekly intervals and were killed at 12 months of age for testicular examination and measurement of body, testes, and comb weights. Semen collected and examined from ethylene dibromide-fed cockerels did not differ significantly from that of the controls. Comb weights at death declined sharply with increasing concentrations of ethylene dibromide in the diet; however, body and testes weights were not affected by the ethylene dibromide.\nAnother experiment  was conducted to determine if ethylene dibromide administration to adult cockerels would affect fertility rates and hatchability of eggs. Eleven mature cockerels each were fed for 105 days a control mash or mash containing 300 ppm of ethylene dibromide.\nSemen was collected about 2, 4, 8, and 10 weeks after the beginning of the experiment. No significant differences were seen between the semen of the controls and that of the cockerels fed ethylene dibromide with respect to ejaculated volume and spermatozoic motility and concentration. Subsequent fertilization tests in hens conducted with the pooled semen collected from the ethylene dibromide-fed and control groups gave no significant differences in fertilization rate or hatchability of eggs at 60 or 105 days.\nHowever, statistically significant reductions in egg size and egg fertility were noted in hens fed ethylene dibromide. previously given ethylene dibromide as described above.\nDoses of 10 mg/kg were injected ip into 250-g rats for 5 consecutive days.\nweek after administration. From the authors' data, the average litter size appears normal during the 5th week and for every week thereafter. The authors concluded that the antifertility effects resulted from ethylene dibromide selectively damaging the spermatid cells, since the short course of exposure produced only transient sterility in rats and corresponded in time to changes that would result from spermatid damage\nAfter 24 hours, all tissues were below 1.0% retention of 14C-radioisotope except for the whole blood, blood plasma, stomach, and kidneys. After 1 hour, essentially all of the administered radioisotope was present in the various mouse tissues, whereas only 89% was present after 3 hours and 16% after 24 hours. It is of interest to note that 3.1, 4.4, and 0.66% of the administered radioisotope was detected in the tail of the epididymis 1, 3, and 24 hours after injection, respectively. Smaller amounts of 14C-radioisotope, up to 1.5% at 3 hours, were also present in the testes. The data presented by the authors suggest that ethylene dibromide is rapidly distributed to a wide variety of tissues. Major concentrations of radioisotope accumulated in the liver, kidneys, and digestive tract.\nThere also seems to be a rapid depletion of radioisotope from the tissues, but the residual radioactive material is still widely distributed throughout the body tissues.\nIn 1976, Plotnick and Conner  conducted a similar study of the tissue distribution of carbon-labeled (14 C) ethylene dibromide in guinea pigs.\nApproximately 66% of the injected dose was excreted in the urine over the 72-hour study, 15% of which was in the first 4 hours, and approximately 3% was excreted in the feces. Plotnick and Conner mentioned that unpublished preliminary studies by their laboratory \"strongly suggest that excretion of unchanged ethylene dibromide in the expired air also represents a significant (10-12% of the dose) route of excretion.\"\n\n【25】 #Carcinogenic, Mutagenic, and Teratogenic Studies (a) Carcinogenesis\nIn 1973, Olson et al  reported the results of a preliminary investigation to determine the potential carcinogenic effects of ethylene dibromide in rats and mice of both sexes by oral administration. Further statements by Powers et al  and Ward and Habermann Initially the only deleterious effect of ethylene dibromide on the rats was a depression in weight gain . As early as 10 weeks after the initiation of the experiment (dose not stated), one squamous cell carcinoma of the stomach was noted in one male and in one female rat. Squamous cell carcinomas of the stomach became more prevalent as the experiment progressed, developing in 83 of 100 male rats and in 70 of 100 female rats intubated with ethylene dibromide.\nThe tumors originated in the forestomach, invaded locally, and eventually metastasized throughout the abdominal cavity. Only one mammary tumor in a female rat was noted in the concurrent corn oil controls; however, in the untreated control group, 6 of 20 male rats and 14 of 20 female rats developed tumors, none of which were squamous cell carcinomas of the stomach. Tumor incidence was 68% in the male rats receiving ethylene dibromide at 80 mg/kg/day versus 98% in those receiving 40 mg/kg/day, and it was 58% in the female rats at 80 mg/kg/day versus 82% at 40 mg/kg/day. Olson et al  postulated that this decreased incidence of tumorigenesis may have resulted from the earlier death of the animals receiving the higher dose or because the animals did not receive ethylene dibromide for a 14-week period between weeks 16 and 30.\nAll 50 male rats had stomach lesions, although one did not contain a neoplasm. The forestomachs had diffuse squamous cell hyperplasia with many papillomatous projections.\nFocal areas of invasion were reported from the origin of the carcinomas.\nInvasion occurred through the stomach wall to the peritoneal cavity, where nodules were reported in 70% of the rats. The metastatic tumors were less differentiated or formed keratin pearls, often accompanied by abcesses or peritonitis.\nThe authors  stated that other types of tumors and lesions were also present in a few rats, including mesotheliomas, intestinal tumors, nodular hyperplasias of the liver, and poorly differentiated stomach tumors.\nEach group of mice received ethylene dibromide in doses of 60 or 120 mg/kg/day for 13 weeks . After 13 weeks, the doses were increased to 100 and 200 mg/kg/day but were reduced to the original doses after 2 weeks because of toxicity. At 42 weeks, the daily dose of ethylene dibromide for all mice was changed to 60 mg/kg/day. At 42 weeks, one male and one female mouse developed squamous cell carcinomas of the stomach at the higher dose regimen, and three males and two females at the lower regimen. High early mortality was encountered in mice receiving the higher dose (40%). No It seems that ethylene dibromide caused an increased incidence of gastric carcinoma in rats treated by intubation with either 40 mg/kg/day or an ordered combination of 80, 0, and 40 mg/kg/day. Carcinomas were found to originate at the site of administration (the stomach) in both species, to invade locally, and eventually to metastasize throughout the abdomen . Also, 72 of 145 mice that developed squamous cell carcinomas were diagnosed after week 59, whereas the vehicle controls were killed at week 59.\n\n【26】 #(b) Mutagenesis\nIn 1972, Buselmaier et al  reported the results of an investigation to determine the potential for ethylene dibromide to induce mutations in the host-mediated assay with Salmonella typhimurium G46 and Serratia marcescens a21 Leu-in NMRI mice and in the in vitro plate test with Salmonella typhimurium G46. Immediately after ip inlection of each bacterial strain, 500 mg/kg of ethylene dibromide emulsified in edible oil was injected subcutaneously into one hind leg of six 10-to 12-week-old mice. Three hours after the injections, they were killed and the fluid from the peritoneal cavity was collected for plating to determine the number of mutant colonies induced. In the comparative in vitro plate test with Salmonella typhimurium, a concentration equivalent to the 500 mg/kg dose was applied to a filter paper disc in the center of the plate, and after a 12-hour incubation, the number of mutant colonies were counted.\nThe investigators  found that ethylene dibromide was definitely mutagenic in the host-mediated assay with Salmonella typhimurium G46 and in vitro with the same organism.\nx 10\" 7 for ethylene dibromide-exposed. The authors  concluded that ethylene dibromide did not require activation through in vivo metabolism to exert its mutagenic effects on Salmonella typhimurium, nor did metabolism of ethylene dibromide sufficiently deactivate its mutagenic potential, since both the host-mediated assay and the in vitro plate tests were positive.\nThe authors included ethylene dibromide in a class of agents which did not meet \"any screening criteria for mutagenic effects,\" although specific data for ethylene dibromide were not presented. No effect of ethylene dibromide on fertility was reported in this paper, which differs from the finding of Edwards et al .\nIn 1973, Clive  tested the mutagenic potential of ethylene dibromide on the back mutation frequency of the thymidine kinase locus in a mammalian somatic cell tissue culture derived from mouse lymphoma cells.\nThirteen new mutations for each 10,000 surviving cells were found under these experimental conditions .\nThe frequency of induced mutations generally increased monotonically after exposure of the cells to increasing concentrations of ethylene dibromide. The induced mutation frequency indicated that ethylene dibromide was mutagenic over the entire range of experimental concentrations when plotted against the growth inhibition, although less potent than ethyl methanesulfonate (an induced mutational frequency of about 2/10,000 cells versus one of 7/10,000 cells at 60% growth inhibition, respectively). The induced mutational frequency in L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells corresponded with that of a mutational frequency of over 600 R of X-irradiation at the highest concentration.\nClive concluded that ethylene dibromide was mutagenic to the L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells although not as potent as ethyl methanesulfonate.\nAt concentrations between 0.001 and 1 mM, ethylene dibromide was very effective in inducing DNA repair in opossum lymphocytes . Repair induction decreased at a concentration of 10 mM of ethylene dibromide, which was presumed to be the result of repair-inhibition phenomena such as those observed for ultraviolet-induced repair. The author indicated that ethylene dibromide was very effective in inducing DNA repair in a manner similar to other alkylating agents, such as methyl methanesulfonate and ethyl methanesulfonate, which were also studied. He stated that only compounds that interact with DNA through covalent bonds induce repair synthesis. Therefore, these data suggest that ethylene dibromide, or its metabolites, may interact via covalent bonding with DNA.\nIn 1974, Vogel and Chandler  measured the possible genetic effects induced by ethylene dibromide in sex-linked lethal tests with fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster. The adult Berlin K male flies were allowed to feed on a 0.3-mM ethylene dibromide solution for 3 days before being allowed to mate with two females for 3 days. A sequence of two 3-day brood periods was initiated (broods 1 and 2), followed by one 4-day brood period (brood 3).\nAt the end of each 3-day breeding period, the treated males were transferred to a new vial and were allowed to mate with two new females.\nand Salmonella typhimurium galE503. Bacteria were poured onto agar plates as suspensions in top agar and were incubated for 8 hours. A few drops of the test compound, 1-5 ¡il (2.2-11.0 mg), were placed near the edge of the plate immediately after the top agar had solidified.\nIn 1974, Sparrow et al\n\n【27】 #Ethylene dibromide has been reported to induce mutations in\n\n【28】 (c)\n\n【29】 #Teratogenesis\nIn 1976, Short et al  examined the effects of ethylene dibromide vapor on rats and mice during organogenesis. The production of congenital defects was used as a measure of inherent toxicity. Female Charles River CD rats or female CD-I mice were caged overnight with proven male breeders; successfully bred females were identified the next morning by the presence of sperm in vaginal smears from rats or of copulation plugs in mice.\nPregnant animals were divided into a control group of 18 rats and 17 mice which would receive a normal diet without inhalation exposure to ethylene dibromide, a group of 18 rats and 13 mice to receive 31.6 ppm (243.32 mg/cu m) of ethylene dibromide and a normal diet, and a group of 17 rats and 9 mice to receive a restricted diet without exposure to ethylene dibromide.\nAll groups of animals were housed in the inhalation chambers for 10 consecutive days beginning on day 6 of gestation. During this time, the groups to be given ethylene dibromide were exposed to the vapor at an average concentration of 31.6 ±1.9 ppm (243.32 ± 14.63 mg/cu m) for 23 hours a day. Rats and mice were killed on gestational day 20 or 18, respectively. Fetuses were surgically removed from the dams, weighed, examined for external anomalies, and fixed for either soft-tissue or skeletal examinations. Ethylene dibromide exposure did not produce mortality in either pregnant rats or mice during the 10-day inhalation period; however, two of nine pregnant mice from the restricted diet group died. Both rats and mice exposed to ethylene dibromide consumed less feed and gained significantly (P<0.05) less weight than the controls during the exposure period, although feed consumption and weight gain returned to normal after cessation of the exposure on the 15th day of pregnancy.\nEthylene dibromide-exposed rats consumed about twice as much food daily as did the feed-restricted rats (10.5 ± 0.6 versus 5.0 ± 0.1 g/day, respectively), but only about one-half of that consumed by the controls (10.5 ± 0.6 versus 21.1 ± 0.4 g/day, respectively).\nRats exposed to ethylene dibromide at a concentration of 31.6 ppm  The authors  concluded that the above-mentioned effects of ethylene dibromide exposure in mice were most likely attributable to malnourishment rather than to ethylene dibromide exposure. It is apparent from the authors' data that some of the anomalies may be compounded by the presence of ethylene dibromide. In addition, if the malnourished controls and ethylene dibromide-exposed animals had been compared with the nonexposed controls at the same statistical probability levels, only the ethylene dibromide-exposed animals would have been significantly different from the controls.\nSkeletal anomalies, in particular the variations in ossification of the incus and supraoccipital bones, were much more prevalent in the ethylene dibromide-exposed mice than in the feedrestricted mice (80-90% of the litters versus 33-50%, respectively). The authors also attributed many of the observed anomalies in the rat dams and fetuses exposed to ethylene dibromide to malnutrition rather than to direct effects of ethylene dibromide exposure. However, they concluded that the increase in the fourth ventricular \"hydrocephaly,\" the reduction in the occurrence of the fourteenth rib, and the increase in the frequency of wavy ribs could be correlated to ethylene dibromide exposure in the rat.\nThe significance of the effects of malnutrition in rats is not clear, and even though ethylene dibromide-exposed rats consumed less food than did controls, they consumed more food than did the rats in the feed-restricted group. It is apparent, however, that an increase in the incidence of anomalies in fetal rats was induced by exposure to the one concentration of ethylene dibromide, but no dose-response relationship for this action is available.\n\n【30】 #Correlation of Exposure and Effect\nNeither studies that correlate workplace concentrations of ethylene dibromide with observed toxic effects nor any epidemiologic studies have been found. Few reports of human exposure to ethylene dibromide exist. Adverse effects resulting from exposure of experimental animals to ethylene dibromide are similar to those described for human exposures and include ocular, dermal, and respiratory irritation and systemic effects on the liver, kidneys, spleen, circulatory system, and nervous system.\nThe effects of ethylene dibromide exposure on the eyes have been noted in several animal species. Merzbach  discovered that a dog exposed for 1 hour to 1 ml (2.2 g) of ethylene dibromide vaporized into a 100-liter chamber showed signs of ocular irritation during the exposure.\nFive hours after the exposure ended, a milky-blue corneal opacity developed which became more pronounced and developed into purulent conjunctivitis in both eyes and an ulcer in one eye. Kochmann  showed that 100 ppm (770 mg/cu m) of ethylene dibromide for 30 minutes/day produced conjunctivitis in cats exposed to the vapor repeatedly until death occurred at approximately 10 days. Rowe et al  reported that instillation of undiluted ezhylene dibromide into the eyes of rabbits caused conjunctival izritation that cleared within 48 hours and left only very slight superficial corneal necrosis which healed completely. Rowe et al  also found that a 10% solution of ethylene dibromide in propylene glycol produced a more severe reaction in the eye than did the undiluted material.\nModerate conjunctival and corneal irritation developed and persisted for 48 hours; healing was complete within 12 days without corneal scarring. A 1% solution produced an effect similar to that caused by the undiluted material. These reports indicate that ethylene dibromide can cause adverse ocular effects after exposure to 1 and 10% solutions, as well as to the undiluted material.\nThe skin of experimental animals is susceptible to penetration and local surface effects resulting from exposure to ethylene dibromide.\nThomas and Yant  noted that liquid ethylene dibromide at doses of 0.25, 0.50, and 1.0 ml (0.55, 1.1 and 2.2 g)/animal produced marked hyperemia of the small cutaneous blood vessels of the shaved abdomens of rats. All animals died within 6-18 hours after application. Rowe et al  found that undiluted ethylene dibromide or a 10% solution in butyl carbitol acetate killed within 24 hours all rabbits to which it was applied dermally; subsequent experiments showed that the dermal LD50 was about 400 mg/kg. Marked erythema and edema were noted when the material was prevented from evaporating from the skin, whereas only slight erythema was noted when evaporation was not inhibited. Undiluted doses of about 210 mg/kg produced a moderate-to-severe erythema, edema, and necrosis of the skin. Similar results were described by Pflesser  in human volunteers exposed to 0.5 ml (1.1 g) of liquid ethylene dibromide for 1-30 minutes by placing small quantities on their arms or hands. Confinement produced more extensive erythema and edema surrounding the application site, and, in one case, blistering occurred as a result of continued contact between ethylene dibromide and the skin. These investigations indicate that localized surface effects on the skin, such as erythema, edema, blistering, or necrosis, may occur after contact with either undiluted or 10% solutions of ethylene dibromide. Percutaneous absorption of 10% solutions has also caused death in experimental animals.\nRespiratory irritation after single exposures to ethylene dibromide vapor has been reported in guinea pigs at concentrations of 8,000 ppm  produced signs of nasal irritation that consisted of a strong reddening of the nasal mucosa . Lucas  demonstrated that a 12-minute exposure of a rabbit to ethylene dibromide vapor caused the lungs to become enlarged and filled with a frothy exudate.\nMerzbach  found that 5 ml (11.0 g) of ethylene dibromide allowed to vaporize in a 100-liter chamber produced severe bleeding in the right lung of a dog exposed for 1 hour. Another dog exposed to the vapor of 1 ml (2.2 g) for 1 hour developed severe hyperemia and bronchopneumonic foci in both lungs. Rowe et al  showed that death occurring in rats exposed to ethylene dibromide at concentrations of 100-10,000 ppm (770-77,000 mg/cu m) for 0.02-16.0 hours was caused by respiratory or cardiac failure at the higher exposures and by pneumonia at the lower ones. The lungs of animals exposed at these concentrations were congested, edematous, hemorrhagic, and inflamed.\nHalf of the male rats exposed at 25 ppm (192.5 mg/cu m) for 7 hours/day for 151 exposures in 213 days died during the experiment, primarily from pneumonia and upper respiratory tract infection. Pulmonary infections were also responsible for a 50% mortality in male guinea pigs and a 25% mortality in females exposed at 25 ppm (192.5 mg/cu m) for 7 hours/day for 145 exposures in 205 days .\nSystemic parenchymal cell damage, particularly in the liver, kidneys, and spleen, develops after single and repeated exposure of experimental animals to ethylene dibromide vapor. Thomas and Yant  observed that guinea pigs receiving single exposures of ethylene dibromide vapor at concentrations of 8,000 ppm  for 150 minutes had a slight granular degeneration of the parenchymal tissue of the liver. Rabbits exposed to an unknown concentration of ethylene dibromide vapor for 10 or 12 minutes had enlarged livers, with slight-to-moderate diffuse fatty changes evident in the rabbit exposed for 10 minutes .\n2 g of vaporized ethylene dibromide in a 100-liter chamber for 1 hour; autopsy showed that a pronounced fatty degeneration of the liver had occurred. Rowe et al  observed that rats exposed at 100-10,000 ppm (770-77,000 mg/cu m) of ethylene dibromide for 0.02-16.0 hours developed cloudy swelling, centrilobular fatty degeneration, and necrosis of the liver. Repeated exposure at approximately 100 ppm (770 mg/cu m) for 30 minutes/day for up to 10 days caused incipient fatty degeneration in the liver of cats . According to Rowe et al , rats exposed to 100 ppm (770 mg/cu m) of ethylene dibromide for 7 hours/day for seven exposures in 9 days had a cloudy swelling of the liver, whereas rabbits exposed to the same concentration for three or four exposures had widespread central fatty degeneration and some necrosis of the other cells of the liver. Rowe et al  reported that slight central fatty degeneration of the liver developed in guinea pigs repeatedly exposed to 50 ppm (385 mg/cu m) of ethylene dibromide for 7 hours/day for 57 exposures in 80 days and in monkeys repeatedly exposed to the same concentration for 49 times in 70 days.\nAdverse splenic effects have been seen in experimental animals after exposure to ethylene dibromide. Single exposures of ethylene dibromide at 8,000 ppm , 7 hours/day, for 9 days developed a slight congestion of the spleen and some hemosiderin deposition. The results from these experiments indicate that adverse effects to the spleen can occur after exposure to ethylene dibromide by inhalation or by percutaneous absorption.\nCardiovascular system effects have been noted in experimental animals subjected to single or multiple exposures of ethylene dibromide.\nConcentrations of 8,000, 4,000, and 2,000 ppm  of ethylene dibromide for 0.02-16.0 hours were caused by cardiac or respiratory failure.\nFew studies have specifically addressed the potential of ethylene dibromide to adversely affect the CNS. Rowe et al  reported that CNS depression was observed at the higher concentrations in rats exposed to 100-10,000 ppm (770-77,000 mg/cu m) for 0.02-16.0 hours, but did not further elucidate the nature of the effects. Rowe et al Experiments with bulls receiving 4 mg/kg on alternate days for 7 or 10 doses showed that the abnormal spermatozoa were present in both the epididymis and testes after 7 doses. After 10 doses, abnormal spermatozoa constituted 67% of the population in the ductus deferens and 77% of the ejaculate, with almost all the abnormal spermatozoa exhibiting tail and acrosomal defects  . These spermatozoic abnormalities may lead to a decrease in the fertility of the bulls and might induce sterility if they continued long enough, although reports have not been found that experimentally test this hypothesis. In rats, ip injections of ethylene dibromide at a dose of 10 mg/kg for 5 days produced a decrease in the average live litter size in female rats mated with experimental males . This decrease in fertility occurred during the 3rd and 4th weeks following administration, which corresponds to the maturation cycle of spermatids in the genital tract of rats. This finding, which corresponds with the findings of the reports of spermiogenic impairment in bulls, supports the postulated sterilizing effect discussed above. It is important to point out that reports have not been found delineating a no-effect level for the reproductive system abnormalities caused by the repeated administration of ethylene dibromide to bulls.\nIn chickens, the function of the female reproductive system is impaired by ethylene dibromide exposure , but the male system appears to be unaffected . Cockerels fed 300 ppm of ethylene dibromide for 12 months showed significant growth retardation at 12 weeks of age; however, semen collected between 9 and 12 months did not differ from control semen, and body and testicular weights were comparable with those of controls . Semen collected between 2 and 10 weeks from cockerels fed 300 ppm for 105 days showed no significant differences when compared with control semen with respect to ejaculated volume and spermatozoic motility and concentrations. Subsequent fertility tests at 60 or 105 days in hens gave no significant differences in fertilization rates or hatchability of eggs. These results indicate that the reproductive system in male chickens was not detectably affected by ethylene dibromide under these experimental conditions. This is in contrast to the effects reported in two mammalian species, cattle and rats, in which definite impairments of the male reproductive system have been noted. A striking reduction (12 versus 86% in the control) in the fertilization rate was seen in hens fed 100 ppm of ethylene dibromide for 4 weeks; all embryos in the eggs from the experimental group were dead  . These results indicate that the female reproductive system in chickens is affected by ethylene dibromide. Although no reports have been found that explore the potential of ethylene dibromide to affect fertility in females of mammalian species, the avian data suggest the potential of ethylene dibromide to impair female fertility. However, until experiments are conducted with mammalian species to assess this potential, extrapolation of the effects seen in chickens to mammals and humans must be uncertain.\nThe mutagenic potential of ethylene dibromide has been established in a wide spectrum of procaryotic and eucaryotic mutational test systems. It has induced mutations in vertebrate cell cultures , insects , bacteria , plants , and fungi . It has induced mutations or mutagenic events in a number of experimental test systems, including the recessive lethal test in Drosophila melanogaster , the host mediated assay in mice with Salmonella typhimurium , and a backward mutation system with mouse lymphoma cells .\nIn addition, positive mutagenic induction has been reported in tests with back mutational systems in certain strains of Salmonella typhimurium .\nEthylene dibromide has also been reported to have given negative results in the dominant lethal test in mice  and in the back mutational test system with Serratia marcescens in the host mediated assay .\nIn a recessive lethal test with Drosophila melanogaster, Vogel and Chandler  reported that 0.3 mM of ethylene dibromide fed to adult males for 3 days induced significant numbers of recessive lethal mutations in the offspring of three successive broods. The brood patterns resulting from ethylene dibromide exposure indicated that ethylene dibromide affected spermatozoic maturation more than spermatozoic formation. The authors considered ethylene dibromide typical of a bifunctional alkylating agent and capable of introducing cross-links into biologic molecules.\nA mammalian somatic cell tissue culture of L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells was exposed to 0.0-3.0 mM of ethylene dibromide in culture media . The induced mutagenic frequency was dose related, typical of other alkylating agents tested, and approximately equivalent to a dose of 600 R of X-irradiation at the highest concentration. Meneghini  noted that ethylene dibromide very effectively induced DNA repair synthesis in opossum lymphocyte cell cultures at concentrations between 0.001 and 1 iriM but decreased at 10 mM. Only compounds that interact with DNA through covalent bonds induce repair synthesis; therefore, ethylene dibromide is typical of other alkylating agents in forming covalent bonds with DNA.\nBacterial and other plant systems have also been used to show the mutagenic potential of ethylene dibromide. Ames hours.\nOnly one study pertaining to the potential of ethylene dibromide to induce fetal anomalies has been found . Fetuses from pregnant mice and rats exposed to approximately 31.6 ppm (243.32 mg/cu m) of ethylene dibromide for 23 hours/day during days 6-15 of gestation were significantly different from fetuses of pregnant control mice and rats. These differences include costal anomalies and hydrocephaly in rat fetuses, and additional anomalies in other ossification processes in mice fetuses.\nFetuses from control mice fed a feed-restricted diet during the experiment to simulate malnourishment exhibited some of the effects found in ethylene dibromide-exposed mice fetuses; however, the frequency of the type and number of anomalies formed in the malnourished group was reduced, but the degree of significance was not as great as that found in the ethylene dibromide-exposed mice fetuses. Although it can be argued that the effects produced by ethylene dibromide exposure are similar in part to those produced by malnourishment, the anomalies in both rat and mouse fetuses from ethylene dibromide-exposed dams were significantly different from those produced by malnourishment alone when both were compared with those found in fetuses from control dams. From these data, it is evident that ethylene dibromide caused fetal abnormalities in mice and rats that were not caused by malnourishment alone.\nIn summary, it is concluded from the data from human and experimental studies that the adverse systemic effects resulting from exposure to ethylene dibromide may include ocular, dermal, and respiratory irritation, The concentration of airborne ethylene dibromide on the premises of an oil refinery ranged from 0. In this report, both the most likely and worst-case emission concentrations were calculated, using the average value of 0.9-1.3 g of ethylene dibromide/gal of automotive fuel (one equivalent of organic bromine is added to gasoline for each two equivalents of lead added). The estimated emission rate for ethylene dibromide by measurement was reported to be 0.000063 g/g lead/gal. The reported losses for entrainment and spillage each were 0.000047 g/g lead/gal. Thus, the total loss because of refueling was reported to be 0.000157 g/g lead/gal. Evaporative losses were calculated to be 0.00014 g/g lead/gal from the automobile funks.\nin\nPorous polymer beads have been used as a collection medium for chlorinated and brominated hydrocarbons . This procedure has not been tested specifically for ethylene dibromide but has been used successfully for closely related halogenated hydrocarbons; thus, it seems feasible that ethylene dibromide could also be collected by this method. The same column is used for sample collection and gas-liquid chromatographic analysis, but only one analysis can be made on each sample.\nSilica gel has been used as a collection medium for ethylene dibromide . One advantage of using a solid adsorbent is that sample loss cannot occur from spillage during sampling or in transit for analysis.\nHowever, silica gel is a polar adsorbent and shows pronounced selectivity in adsorbing polar molecules, particularly water . Studies with silica gel tubes indicated that water vapor could displace organic molecules during a normal sampling operation . Although similar studies have not been conducted for ethylene dibromide, it is reasonable to assume that similar displacement of significant quantities of ethylene dibromide by water vapor could occur.\nActivated charcoal has been used as an adsorbent in conjunction with gas-liquid chromatography . Charcoal is an excellent collecting medium because of its nonpolarity and its affinity for organic vapors and gases. As such, water vapor does not readily displace organic molecules as is the case with silica gel. However, adsorption and desorption efficiencies may vary with different batches of charcoal; therefore, it is necessary to determine the desorption efficiency for each new batch of charcoal.\nCharcoal tubes containing as much as 600 mg of activated charcoal are commercially available ,\nOther sampling devices used for the collection of organic solvents and halogenated hydrocarbons may be adaptable to ethylene dibromide collection. These include sampling bottles , bubblers , and plastic bags . Chemical analysis has been used to estimate ethylene dibromide concentrations in the collection media. Aeration has been used by Peterson et al  to desorb ethylene dibromide from the silica gel; pyrolysis of the free ethylene dibromide produced bromine and hydrobromic acid. These products were collected in a second absorption solution of 1% sodium carbonate and 1% sodium formate in deionized water and quantitated by titrimetric analysis of the inorganic bromide present. Aman et al  132 estimated the airborne ethylene dibromide concentration by absorbing the free ethylene dibromide with 1% sodium hydroxide and by quantitating the hypobromite formed iodometrically. Dumas  determined airborne ethylene dibromide concentrations by coulometric titration of sodium bromide after absorption of ethylene dibromide in methanolic sodium hydroxide and digestion by boiling under reflux for 15 minutes on a steam bath. These methods, like most chemical methods, require somewhat bulky apparatus and are not specific for ethylene dibromide since any aliphatic brominated compound will interfere and be included in the quantitative estimate.\nPhysicochemical methods have been developed or adapted to identify and quantitate concentrations of airborne ethylene dibromide. Christie et al  modified a refrigerant leak-detector lamp to detect organic halogen compounds, including ethylene dibromide, in the atmosphere at a minimum concentration of 5 ppm. The procedure is dependent on visual estimation of the intensity of a flame color in response to the vapor concentration and is not specific for ethylene dibromide.\nFlame chemiluminescence has been reported by Crider  to detect ethylene dibromide concentrations in air of 0.03 ppm. This method has not been tested on mixtures of halogenated hydrocarbons, and it is too early in its development to enable prediction of the practicality of the method for area or personal monitoring in an occupational environment.\nOther physicochemical methods have been developed for halogen compounds, but they have not been tested for identification and quantitation of ethylene dibromide. One of these methods, based on nitrogen enhancement of an AC spark, has been used for continuous measurement of halogenated compounds in field situations . The instrument is lightweight, portable, fast-responding, and reportedly capable of detecting halogenated hydrocarbons in the ppm range. However, until testing with ethylene dibromide has been conducted, the feasibility and reliability of this instrument is not known.\nEthylene dibromide is nonflammable and nonexplosive at ordinary temperatures, but since it can be decomposed to toxic and corrosive compounds, such as hydrobromic acid, by contact with open flames or red-hot surfaces , it should be appropriately stored and handled to prevent such contacts. Special precautions are necessary for maintenance and emergency repair work, such as welding, cutting, or any spark-and flame-generating operations. Furthermore, it is recommended that smoking be prohibited in workplace areas where ethylene dibromide is manufactured, handled, blended, or stored. Since decomposition may occur  and highly toxic aldehyde vapors and acid gases may be emitted , ethylene dibromide must be protected from direct light and excessive temperature. Ethylene dibromide reacts rapidly with certain metals, such as aluminum and magnesium, to form combustible and explosive organometallic compounds  and with liquid ammonia , Therefore, it is recommended that reasonable precautions be taken to keep ethylene dibromide separated from these materials.\nEngineering controls should be used to keep the concentration of airborne ethylene dibromide below the recommended occupational exposure All containers used to transport, hold, or process ethylene dibromide should be made of ethylene dibromide-resistant materials, such as lined steel or stainless steel, and should be periodically inspected for signs of wear, corrosion, or leaks by manual and instrumental means. All valves, pipes, and seals used in pumping ethylene dibromide from processing areas to storage areas or transportation loading sites should be made of ethylene dibromide-resistant materials and should be periodically inspected for possible leaks, weak points, or signs of wear.\nEthylene dibromide is a severe eye and skin irritant in humans (G Ter Haar, written communication, January 1977) and can be absorbed through the intact skin of animals in quantities sufficient to present an imminent hazard . In view of this, the use of personal protective equipment, including nylon-impregnated neoprene gloves , ethylene dibromideresistant and fire-retardant clothing, rubber boots or overshoes, bib-type aprons, and chemical safety goggles is recommended when contact by liquid ethylene dibromide with the skin and eyes is possible.\nPersonnel working with ethylene dibromide must be instructed in emergency procedures and participate in periodic, simulated emergency drills.\nAll personnel not involved in the specified emergency operations must be immediately evacuated from the area. Special training sessions must be held and written emergency procedures must be updated periodically.\nThese should include the location, use, and maintenance of first-aid, firefighting, and decontamination equipment.\nTo prevent the adverse effects caused by ethylene dibromide, it is recommended that exposure to ethylene dibromide vapor or liquid be kept at a minimum. Routine visual and functional inspections must be made by trained personnel to ensure that processes in which ethylene dibromide is used are completely closed. If leaks or spills occur in the processing, handling, or storage of ethylene dibromide, these must be promptly corrected, regardless of the ethylene dibromide concentration in the environment. It is recommended that nonessential personnel be evacuated from the immediate area where a leak or spill has occurred until decontamination of the area is complete. If employees must withdraw samples from a process involving the use of ethylene dibromide, an impervious suit, including gloves, boots, and air-supplied hood, should be worn. An effective exhaust system for trapping any ethylene dibromide vapor may be used in place of the air-supplied hood. Any waste or residues containing ethylene dibromide should be incinerated, buried, or otherwise disposed of so that no ethylene dibromide is released into the environment.\nApplicable local, state, and federal regulations should be followed. Air exhausted from ethylene dibromide workplace areas must be decontaminated by incineration, chemical treatment, or other effective means so that the release of ethylene dibromide into the environment will be minimized.\nSafety showers and eyewash fountains should be located in or near areas where ethylene dibromide exposures are likely to occur and should be properly maintained.\nIt is recommended that employees immediately remove contaminated clothing, flush all affected skin surfaces with water for at least 15 minutes, and then obtain medical attention.\nSince ethylene dibromide is toxic when ingested and has caused death in a woman after ingestion , it is recommended that handwashing facilities, soap, and water be made available to the employees. As a good hygiene practice, it is recommended that employees wash their hands before consuming beverages or food, using tobacco, or using toilet facilities.\nIn summary, precautions should be exercised with ethylene dibromide to prevent serious consequences which may result from ingestion, inhalation, and skin or eye contact. Processes in which ethylene dibromide is used in large quantities should be carried out in closed systems.\nWell-designed hoods, ventilation systems, and exhaust systems should be used to maintain concentrations below those specified by this standard.\n\n【31】 #VI. DEVELOPMENT OF STANDARD Basis for Previous Standards\nIn 1953, the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) adopted a threshold limit value (TLV) of 25 ppm as an 8hour TWA concentration for 1,2-dibromoethane (ethylene dibromide) .\nNo specific basis for this TLV has been found. In 1954, the ACGIH  changed the name to ethylene dibromide in the official TLV list, and, in 1956, they added the value of 190 mg/cu m to the official entry . In al  reported that ethylene dibromide was readily absorbed through the intact skin of rabbits and from the gastrointestinal tract of rats, mice, guinea pigs, chickens, and rabbits. Ethylene dibromide vapor caused CNS depression, pulmonary irritation, and liver and kidney damage in rats and guinea pigs after single exposures. Rats, guinea pigs, monkeys, and rabbits tolerated repeated exposures of ethylene dibromide vapor at 25 ppm for 7 hours/day, 5 days/week, for about 6 months without adverse effects, but these species did not tolerate well a similar exposure at 50 ppm.\nIn 1965, the ACGIH  recommended that special emphasis be given to the potential for skin absorption of 1,2-dibromoethane by adding the designation \"skin\" after the name in the TLV list. Such a notation refers to the potential contribution to overall exposure by the dermal route, including mucous membranes and eyes, either by airborne, or more particularly, by direct contact with ethylene dibromide. This designation was intended to indicate that measures for the prevention of absorption from skin and mucous membranes were necessary if the TLV was to be successful in limiting occupational exposure to a safe level. In 1965, the ACGIH  also recommended that the TLV of 25 ppm as a TWA concentration for ethylene dibromide be tentatively changed to a ceiling limit of 25 ppm.\nThe basis  for this limit was primarily the report by Rowe et al , discussed previously, and the paper by Lucas . Lucas  observed that single 10-to 12-minute exposures of rabbits to a concentration of ethylene dibromide vapor sufficient to produce anesthesia resulted in rapid breathing, phonation, and death within 15-18 hours. The shift of the TLV from a TWA value to a ceiling limit was made final in 1967.\nIn 1971, the ACGIH  recommended changing the ceiling limit of 25 ppm to an 8-hour TWA concentration of 20 ppm (145 mg/cu m ) . The 1971 Documentation of the Threshold Limit Values for Substances in Workroom Air  cited several studies with no particular emphasis on how the limit was set. These reports included Rowe et al , Lucas , Kochmann\nPresumably, the study by Rowe et al  was the principal basis on which the new limit was set. The proposed value of 20 ppm as a TWA concentration was adopted in 1973 . The basis for this change as stated in the 1974 supplement of the 1971 Documentation , did not differ from that stated in 1971.\nFlorida, Mississippi, Pennsylvania, and South Carolina have adopted a TWA concentration of 25 ppm (190 mg/cu m) as their environmental limit for ethylene dibromide .\nIn Finland, the German Democratic Republic, and Yugoslavia, the maximum allowable concentration (MAC) for the workplace environment is 190 mg/cu m (25 ppm) . In the Rumanian Socialist Republic, 200 mg/cu m (approximately 26 ppm) of ethylene dibromide is the maximum concentration allowed in the occupational environment, whereas in Poland, the MAC allowed for ethylene dibromide is 100 mg/cu m (13 ppm) . Although the USSR does not currently recommend a standard for ethylene dibromide, the US recommendation of 145 mg/cu m (20 ppm) is stated to be inadmissibly high.\nThis standard was adopted from the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) recommendation Z37. , and conjunctival irritation was noted in rabbits after instillation of undiluted, 10%, or 1% solutions of ethylene dibromide . The irritation subsided within 2-12 days in the rabbits without causing corneal scarring. Marked hyperemia of the cutaneous blood vessels surrounding the application site was found after 0.25, 0.50, or 1.0 ml (0.55, 1.1, or 2.2 g) of ethylene dibromide was applied to the abdomen of rats . Rabbits responded similarly when undiluted or 10% solutions of ethylene dibromide were applied to the abdomen . Application of 210 mg/kg of the undiluted chemical caused marked erythema, edema, and necrosis of the skin.\nRespiratory tract irritation caused by ethylene dibromide vapor has been seen in guinea pigs after single exposures at 2,000 ppm  for 150 minutes , and for cats after exposures as low as 100 Other systemic damage also occurred in animals after single and repeated exposures to ethylene dibromide vapor.\nGuinea pigs exposed at concentrations of ethylene dibromide of 2,000 ppm  of ethylene dibromide for 0.02-16.0 hours developed cloudy swelling, centrilobular fatty degeneration, and necrosis of the liver, cloudy swelling and a slight interstitial congestion and edema of the kidneys, and CNS depression at the higher concentrations .\nRepeated inhalation exposures of rats for 7 days and rabbits for 3-4 days at 100 ppm (770 mg/cu m) of ethylene dibromide for 7 hours/day produced slight congestion of the spleens of rats, cloudy swelling and a slight leukocytic infiltration in the livers of rats, and widespread central fatty degeneration and some necrosis in the livers of rabbits .\nExposure of guinea pigs and monkeys at 50 ppm (285 mg/cu m) of ethylene dibromide for 7 hours/day, 5 days/week, for 70-80 days caused only slight central fatty degeneration of the liver . Cats exposed at 100 ppm (770 mg/cu m) of ethylene dibromide for 30 minutes/day for about 10 days had enlarged spleens. Death resulted from circulatory system damage to the heart and vessels .\nCNS effects, such as agitation, restlessness, body tremors, or unconsciousness, are caused by exposure to ethylene dibromide , but they have not been sufficiently described to permit an adequate evaluation or quantitation of their relevance or validity.\nMammalian studies indicate that reproductive abnormalities, including antifertility  and spermatozoic anomalies , occur from exposure to ethylene dibromide. One report  indicated that five ip injections of 10 mg/kg given to male rats produced a decrease in fertility only during the 3rd and 4th weeks after injection. Since spermatids require about 3-4 weeks to mature into spermatozoa in the rat, the evidence indicates that ethylene dibromide affects the development of the spermatids that were present at the time of injection. This is further supported by the return of normal fertility 5 weeks after the injection. Three studies with bulls In another experiment , production of abnormal spermatozoa occurred with a dose as small as 4 mg/kg given on alternate days for seven doses. These spermatozoic abnormalities would greatly reduce the fertility, even if they did not cause total sterility.\nAlthough these effects were from the ingestion of ethylene dibromide and not from inhalation or dermal contact, they indicate that a hazard, including decreased fertility and even temporary sterility, may result from inhalation or percutaneous absorption of ethylene dibromide.\nOne study, reported by several authors , was conducted to determine the carcinogenic properties of ethylene dibromide. Rats and mice given daily oral doses by gavage of ethylene dibromide at 40 and 60 mg/kg, respectively, for 52-64 weeks developed squamous cell carcinomas in the stomach. These carcinomas invaded locally and metastasized throughout the abdominal cavity.\nMale and female rats developed stomach carcinomas as early as 10 weeks after the start of administration of ethylene dibromide.\nThe carcinomas became more prevalent as the daily doses of ethylene dibromide were continued, and the final percentage of male rats with tumors after administration of 40 mg/kg/day was 98% after termination of the experiment at 54 weeks. Male rats were more susceptible to tumorigenesis than female rats; 80% of all the males in the study developed tumors versus 38% of all the females. The concurrent control populations did not develop squamous cell carcinomas. More than 70% of all the mice were reported to The mutagenic potential of ethylene dibromide is well established in both animal and plant systems. It induces mutations in vertebrate cell cultures , insects , bacteria , plants , and fungi  .\nStudies with mouse lymphoma cells  indicated that a dose-related effect, typical of those of other alkylating agents tested, existed over the range of 0.0-3.0 mM ethylene dibromide. The effect of the highest concentration was approximately equal to that of a dose of 600 R of Xirradiation.\nA study in a host-mediated assay system  with Salmonella typhimurium G46 in mice suggested that ethylene dibromide was mutagenic at a dose of 500 mg/kg.\nA second part of this study  showed that an equivalent dose produced a positive mutagenic effect on Salmonella typhimurium G46 in vitro, indicating that ethylene dibromide did not require metabolic activation and was not deactivated by metabolism.\nSimilar positive mutagenic results occurred in Salmonella typhimurium TA Several studies  suggest that the mechanism of mutagenic activity of ethylene dibromide is based on its ability to alkylate, or covalently bond to, DNA in the exposed cells. Ethylene dibromide is a bifunctional alkylating agent capable of introducing cross-links into biologic materials  by displacement of the two reactive bromine atoms by reacting with amine, sulfhydryl, carboxy or other electron-donating groups.\nEthylene dibromide, or its metabolites, has interacted with DNA through covalent bonds to induce DNA repair synthesis in opossum lymphocyte cells . Another indication of ethylene dibromide's ability to alkylate DNA is that ethylene dibromide is mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium TA 1530 and TA 1535, both transitional mutational systems . These data  suggest strongly that the most plausible chemical basis for the mutagenic activity of ethylene dibromide in procaryotic and eucaryotic organisms is its alkylation of cellular constituents such as DNA. This broad biologic reactivity suggests that ethylene dibromide may be capable of increasing spontaneous mutation rates in humans. However, the quantitative aspects of this potential have not been determined. Since the process of induction of mutations is a stochastic, virtually irreversible process, any increased frequency of mutation in exposed populations would accumulate as a function of the total absorbed dose of ethylene dibromide. Therefore, an adequate assessment of the importance of the plant and submammalian animal data in extrapolating to the concentrations of airborne ethylene dibromide present in the workplace environment is difficult, but the widespread mutagenic activity of ethylene dibromide does give cause for concern about damage to the genetic mechanisms in employees working with it.\nConcern for employee health requires that the probability of the occurrence of long-term effects of ethylene dibromide be minimized. The preliminary report available to NIOSH from a review of the mortality experience of 161 employees of one manufacturer induced stomach cancer in the rat. In addition, the extensive experimental evidence on the induction of adverse effects in lower species 9,33,62,66,69 and the formation of stable covalent bonds between ethylene dibromide and cellular constituents  indicate that the occupational exposure limit should be lowered to decrease the potential hazard to employees.\nBecause of the intrinsic, stochastic, and virtually irreversible character of the chemical reactions that initiate the carcinogenic and mutagenic processes, the risk of adverse effects is a function of the rate of absorption and the total absorbed dose. Consequently, this risk can be reduced to any value necessary to protect the employees by decreasing both the absorption rate (to prevent saturation of the enzymatic detoxification mechanisms) and the total lifetime dose (to reduce the probability of deleterious stochastic processes, such as carcinogenesis and mutagenesis, from occurring).\nThe unusual complexity of the dynamics of the cellular response mechanisms to ethylene dibromide intoxication is emphasized by the doserate effect relationship observed for induction of gastric neoplasms.\nDaily intragastric doses of 40 and 60 mg/kg induced tumors in rats and mice within 10 weeks , whereas daily 7-hour inhalation exposures of about 49 mg/kg did not result in the observation of tumors even after 30 weeks .\nA plausible pharmacokinetic explanation for the observed differences exists. Since the rat's capacity to metabolize ethylene dibromide  exceeds the rate of absorption (at 25 ppm) by a factor of at least 100, the concentration of ethylene dibromide in tissues should be considerably less than that in the air, which is about 1.02 /umoles/liter at 25 ppm . The concentration of ethylene dibromide in corn oil used in the intubation study ranged between 0.066 and 0.132 moles/liter. Consequently, the mucosal cells of the stomach may have been exposed for short periods to concentrations of ethylene dibromide up to 100,000 times that to which lung tissue would be exposed during inhalation exposures at 25 ppm (192.5 mg/cu m ) . The saturation of enzymatically catalyzed detoxification and repair mechanisms may occur in the stomach tissues, resulting in an amplification of the tissue damage, which otherwise may be minimal. These pharmacokinetic considerations are consistent with the experimental results of Rowe et al , where the product of the concentration and duration of exposure to produce 50% mortality among the exposed rats was found to be approximately constant for higher concentrations of ethylene dibromide but not for lower ones. The evidence indicates that tissue detoxication and repair mechanisms exist, but that they cannot negate completely the intrinsic capacity of ethylene dibromide to alkylate cellular constituents.\nAlthough it is not possible at this time to state categorically an exposure concentration at which ethylene dibromide may be regarded to be completely without risk, NIOSH considers that the recommended occupational exposure limit should be substantially lower than the current federal standard of 20 ppm as an 8-hour TWA limit, 30 ppm ceiling. The recommended occupational exposure limit for ethylene dibromide, at the least, should be reduced sufficiently to keep the total lifetime dose well below the cumulative doses shown to be hazardous in animal experiments. In considering the alkylating capability of ethylene dibromide and the potential adverse effects on the organism which may result, especially at the subcellular level, NIOSH recommends that the occupational exposure limit for ethylene dibromide be reduced to a ceiling concentration of 1.0 mg/cu m (0.13 ppm) for any 15-minute sampling period. This represents a reduction to one-two-hundred and thirtieth of the current federal ceiling limit for ethylene dibromide and is a level at which an employee would inhale a maximum of about 686 mg/kg of ethylene dibromide during a 40-year working lifetime, which is substantially below that total dose known to induce adverse effects in experimental animals. It is believed that so long as care is taken to prevent entrance of any appreciable amount of ethylene dibromide into the digestive tract, adherence to this exposure limit will protect against acute adverse effects and will reduce the potential long-term effects to a negligible level. NIOSH concludes that reduction to a ceiling concentration of 1.0 mg/cu m (0.13 ppm) will protect employees from acute illness resulting from exposure to ethylene dibromide and will reduce markedly, and perhaps remove entirely, any hazard of adverse effects on health from long-term exposure to this chemical. Studies should be conducted to determine the feasibility of using body fluids, such as blood or urine, as the basis of a method for biologic monitoring of workers that are occupationally exposed to ethylene dibromide.\n(h)\n\n【32】 #Long-term Animal Exposure Studies\nLong-term exposure of several animal species at a variety of concentrations of ethylene dibromide vapor approaching the recommended environmental limit is needed. These studies should simulate occupational exposure conditions of 8-10 hours/day, 4-5 days/week, for at least 18-24 months and the animals maintained until the end of their natural life.\nThese studies should be properly designed and performed to allow for assessment of general body parameters, biochemical/physiologic parameters, and gross or microscopic examinations of involved organs including at least the liver, lungs, spleen, kidneys, CNS, and circulatory system.\nIn addition, repeated long-term experiments should be performed to determine the effects of ethylene dibromide absorption through the skin.\nSimilar schedules and experimental designs as those for inhalation studies should be followed.\nThe National Cancer Institute has informed NIOSH that a long-term experiment to study the possible carcinogenic effects from the inhalation of ethylene dibromide is presently being conducted. Several studies  have indicated that ethylene dibromide, or its metabolites, is widely circulated throughout the body and remains widely distributed in the body tissues for a considerable time. These studies also indicated that ethylene dibromide, or its metabolites, is excreted in the urine and eliminated in the feces.  The sampling train consists of a charcoal tube and a vacuum pump.\nCharcoal tubes: Glass tubes, with both ends flamesealed, 7-cm long, with a 6-mm OD and a 4-mm ID, containing two sections of 20/40 mesh activated charcoal separated by a 2-mm portion of polyurethane foam. The activated charcoal is prepared from coconut shells and is fired at 600 C prior to packing\n\n【33】 #METHOD FOR SAMPLING ETHYLENE DIBROMIDE IN AIR\nThe pressure drop across the tube when in use must be less than 1 inch of mercury at a flowrate of 1 liter/minute. Tubes with the above specifications are commercially available.\nPump:\nA battery-operated pump, complete with clip for attachment to the employee's belt, capable of operation at 200 ml/minute or less with a controlled accuracy of + 5%.\n\n【34】 #(b) Calibration\nThe accurate calibration of a sampling pump is essential for the correct interpretation of the volume sampled. The frequency of calibration is dependent on the use, care, and handling to which the pump is subjected.\nPumps should also be recalibrated if they have been misused or if they have just been repaired or received from a manufacturer. If the pump receives hard usage, more frequent calibration may be necessary. Maintenance and calibration should be performed on a regular schedule and records of these should be kept.\nOrdinarily, pumps should be calibrated in the laboratory both before they are used in the field and after they have been used to collect a large number of field samples\nRepeat the procedure in  above at least three times, average the results, and calculate the flowrate by dividing the volume between the preselected marks by the time required for the soapbubble to traverse the distance. If, for the pump being calibrated, the volume of air sampled is calculated as the product of the number of strokes times a stroke factor (given in units of volume/stroke), the stroke factor is the quotient of the volume between the two preselected marks divided by the number of strokes. Therefore, if the analysis cannot be performed within 16-24 hours after sampling has been completed, the samples must be stored at -25 C or below. Refrigerated samples may be stored for two weeks. (25 liters), the probable range of this method is 40-800 nanograms/sample solution at a detector sensitivity that gives nearly full deflection on the strip chart recorder for a 1-mg sample. The method may be capable of measuring much smaller amounts if the desorption efficiency is adequate and if a photon-ionization detector is used on the chromatograph. Desorption efficiency must be determined over the range used.\nThe upper limit of the range of the method is dependent on the adsorptive capacity of the charcoal tube. This capacity varies with the concentrations of ethylene dibromide and other substances in the air4 mg of ethylene dibromide when a test atmosphere containing 446 mg/cu m of ethylene dibromide in dry air was sampled at 200 ml/minute for 240 minutes; at that time, the concentration of ethylene dibromide in the effluent was less than 2% of that in the influent. If a particular atmosphere is suspected of containing a large amount of contaminant, a smaller sampling volume should be taken.\n\n【35】 #Interferences\nCompounds which have about the same retention time as ethylene dibromide and which are detected by the electron capture detector will interfere with the analysis. This type of interference can be overcome by changing the operating conditions of the instrument, usually by modifying the column, the column temperature, or both.\nEthylene dibromide will not be efficiently trapped when the amount of water vapor in the air is so great that condensation occurs in the trapping media.\nLesser amounts of water vapor in the air may severely decrease the breakthrough volume. When interfering compounds are known or suspected to be present in the air, such information including their suspected identities could be transmitted with the sample.\n\n【36】 #Precision and Accuracy\nThe relative standard deviation for the combined analytical and sampling method in the prescribed range of 203-2,370 nanograms/charcoal tube was 0.070.\n\n【37】 #Advantages and Disadvantages of the Method\nThis method uses a sampling device that is small, portable, and involves no liquids.\nInterferences are minimal and can usually be eliminated by altering chromatographic conditions. Analysis of the charcoal tubes can be accomplished rapidly. Simultaneous analysis of two or more compounds suspected of being present in the same sample can usually be accomplished by simply changing chromatographic conditions.\nOne disadvantage of the method is that the amount of sample which can be collected by this method is limited by the weight of ethylene dibromide which the tube will hold before breakthrough\nRecoveries of ethylene dibromide from charcoal are decreased upon storage of the charcoal tube samples at room temperature, particularly with lesser amounts of analyte. The use of an internal standard is required in order to attain good precision. Other organic compounds in high concentrations may displace ethylene dibromide from the charcoal. High humidity may decrease the absorptive efficiency and capacity of the charcoal. The precision of the method is limited by the reproducibility of the pressure drop across the charcoal tube. This drop will affect the flowrate and the volume of air sampled, since the pump is usually calibrated for one tube only.\n(e)\n\n【38】 #Measurement of area:\nThe areas of the sample peaks are measured by electronic integration or some other suitable method of area measurement.\nPreliminary sample results are read from a standard curve prepared as outlined below.\n(f)\nThe approximate retention times of ethylene dibromide and two potential internal standards under the GC conditions described in this method are: In the case of the internal standard method, prepare standard curves by plotting concentration in mg/ml versus the ratio of the peak areas of ethylene dibromide to n-pentadecane.\nCompound\n\n【39】 #Calculations\nRead the weight in milligrams of ethylene dibromide corresponding to the total peak area from the standard curve.\nNo volume corrections are needed because the standard curve is based on mg ethylene dibromide/ml of benzene-methanol and the volume of sample injected is identical to the volume of the standards injected.

Seborrheic dermatitis causes flaky, itchy, red skin and temporary hair loss. It particularly affects the sebum-gland rich areas of skin. Causes of seborrheic dermatitis include Malassezia furfur (formerly known as Pityrosporum ovale) as well as genetic, environmental, hormonal, and immune-related factors. Medical therapy for seborrheic dermatitis includes antifungal agents, corticosteroids, and lithium salts.\n\n【2】 #Historical Perspective\n- In 1887, seborrheic dermatitis was first described by Unna.\n- In 1894, a hypothesis was made by Unna and Sabouraud that causative agents responsible for seborrheic dermatitis include yeast Malassezia, bacteria, or both as they were obtained in high quantities in cultures obtained from the affected patients.\n\n【3】 #Classification\nThere is no established classification system for seborrheic dermatitis. However, it may be classified according to the anatomical location, age group, symptoms, etiology and severity.\n\n【4】 ## Classification by Anatomy\nSeborrheic dermatitis may be classified on the basis of anatomical location into following types:\n- Localized\nScalp: Most common presentation in  infants known as cradle cap\nFace: Most commonly involves eyelids, eyebrows, and nasolabial folds\nRetroauricular\nBody folds: Commonly affects axilla, breast folds, and inguinal area\nTrunk: May be seen in severe cases and most common site of involvement is lower abdomen\nUpper Chest: Most commonly seen in adults\nPityriasiform: Oval macules and patches.\nPetaloid type: Small papules with oily scales may enlarge to become patches resembling petals of flower.\n- Generalized: Mostly seen in infants; it is associated with Leiner's disease and children with severe immunodeficiency.\n\n【5】 ## Classification by Age\n- Infantile: Occurs in first three months of life.\n- Adults: Occurs most commonly between 30-60 years of age.\n\n【6】 ## Classification by Symptomatic Presentation\n- Non pruritic: Most commonly occurs in infants\n- Pruritic: Most commonly occurs in older children and adults\n\n【7】 ## Classification by Etiology\n- Idiopathic\n- Infectious\n- Autoimmune / Inflammatory\n\n【8】 ## Classification by Severity\n- Mild to moderate disease: Occurs in immunocompetent individuals\n\n【9】 #Pathophysiology\nThe exact pathophysiology of seborrheic dermatitis remains unclear. However, several mechanisms are hypothesized to play a role in pathogenesis of seborrheic dermatitis.\n\n【10】 ## Pathogenesis\nHypotheses regarding the pathogenesis of seborrheic dermatitis include:\nHypotheses related to Malassezia :\n- A strong correlation between presence of the fungal yeast Malassezia and response to antifungals in patients with seborrheic dermatitis.\n- Malassezia is a lipophilic yeast found  on the skin of both healthy individuals and seborrheic dermatitis patients. It is thought that host reaction to Malassezia or its metabolites causes an inflammatory reaction that may have a significant role in the process\n- Another proposed mechanism for seborrheic dermatitis suggests that a disrupted lipid layer of Malassezia leads to an increased production of pro inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-7, and decreased production of IL-10.\nOther Hypotheses\n- Sebaceous gland activity\n- Immune response\n- Epidermal barrier dysfunction\n- Corneocyte shape\n- Disrupted lipid lamellar structure\n- Neurogenic and other factors\n\n【11】 ## Genetics\nThere is no specific genetic cause for seborrheic dermatitis\n\n【12】 ## Associated conditions\n- Parkinsonism\n- Epilepsy\n- Depressive mood disorder\n- Traumatic brain injury\n- Spinal cord injury\n- HIV\n- Lymphoma - Downs syndrome\n\n【13】 ## Gross Pathology\nSuperficial flaking and redness are characteristic findings of seborrheic dermatitis.\n- Seborrheic dermatitis showing erythema on face. - By Roymishali - Own work, CC BY-SA 3.0, - Upper chest showing redness and crusting. - Adapted from Dermatology Atlas.\n\n【14】 ## Microscopic Histopathology\nHistopathological findings of seborrheic dermatitis may be categorized into the following stages:\n- Acute\n- Focal mild spongiosis with superficial crust containing neutrophils.\n- Edema of papillary dermis.\n- Dilatation of blood vessels in superficial vascular plexus with  infiltration of lymphocytes, histiocytes.\n- Psoriasiform hyperplasia.\n- Keratin showing presence of yeasts.\n- Chronic\n- Extensive psoriasiform hyperplasia - Minimal spongiosis - Follicular crusting\n\n【15】 #Causes\nThe cause of seborrheic dermatitis remains unknown; however, the following factors may have been implicated:\n- Malassezia furfur (formerly known as Pityrosporum ovale).\n- Excessive vitamin A\n- Lack of biotin, - pyridoxine (vitamin B6)\n\n【16】 #Differentiating Seborrheic dermatitis from Other Diseases\nSymptoms of seborrheic dermatitis may overlap with other skin conditions such as psoriasis, candidiasis, contact dermatitis, and atopic dermatitis. Differential diagnosis of seborrheic dermatitis may be classified into two types by age group:\n\n【17】 ## Differential diagnosis in Infants\n- Atopic dermatitis - Candidiasis - Dermatophytosis - Langerhans cell histiocytosis - Psoriasis - Pityriasis amiantacea - Rosacea - Tinea capitis - Zinc deficiency\n\n【18】 ## Differential diagnosis in Adults\n- Systemic lupus erythematosus\n- Candidiasis - Erythrasma - Contact dermatitis - Psoriasis - Tinea versicolor - Secondary syphilis - Pemphigus foliaceus\n- Rosacea\n\n【19】 ## Epidemiology\nWorldwide, the prevalence of seborrheic dermatitis is estimated to be 11000 cases per 100,000. Prevalence of seborrheic varies among individuals based on the following factors:\n- Higher reporting of mild cases\n- Higher in patients with HIV with 35000 per 100,000 in early diagnosis and 85000 per 100,000 with full blown AIDS\n- Higher prevalence seen among those directly exposed to UV radiation\n- The exact incidence of seborrheic dermatitis is unknown\n\n【20】 ### Age\nSeborrheic dermatitis demonstrates a tri-modal age distribution as follows:\n- The first incidence peak is seen in infants around three to four months of age, which usually resolves within 12 months\n- The second incidence peak is seen around puberty.\n- Age groups showing lowest prevalence of clinical disease is seen in individuals younger than 12 years.\n\n【21】 ### Gender\nMales are more commonly affected with seborrheic dermatitis than females.\n\n【22】 ### Race\n- Seborrheic dermatitis is rarely seen in African Americans.\n- If seborrheic dermatitis is seen in this population, it leads to high suspicion of HIV in affected individuals.\n\n【23】 #Risk Factors\nThe most common risk factors for seborrheic dermatitis include:\nImmunosuppression\n- Organ transplant recipients\n- HIV/AIDS\n- Malignancies such as lymphoma\nNeurologic and psychiatric cases\n- Parkinsonism\n- Depression\n- Tardive dyskinesia - Traumatic brain injury\n- Epilepsy\n- Facial nerve palsy\n- Spinal cord injury\nGenetic disorders\n- Downs syndrome\n- Hailey-Hailey Disease\n- Cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome\n- Mutation in (ZNF750) coding a zinc finger protein (C2H2)\nOther risk factors\n- Stress\n- Treatment with psoralene and UV-A\n- Male gender\n- Obesity\n- Diabetes mellitus\n- Seasonal changes such as low temperature and decreased humditiy\n- Drugs such as haloperidol deconate, lithium and chlorpromazine\n\n【24】 #Screening\nThere are no screening guidelines for seborrheic dermatitis.\n\n【25】 ## Natural History\n- The symptoms of seborrheic dermatitis usually develop in the first three months in infants. It may resolve without treatment in most cases in few months and rarely presents after 12 months.\n- In adults, symptoms of seborrheic dermatitis usually develop in the second and third decade of life, and start with symptoms such as redness, scaling and crusting on affected areas. However, occurrence of seborrheic dermatitis is highly variable and it may present after 50 years of age.\n\n【26】 ## Complications\nCommon complications of seborrheic dermatitis include:\n- Temporary or permanent hair loss\n- Secondary bacterial infection\n- Blepharitis - Abscess of meibomian glands\n- Otitis externa - Extensive involvement of body\n\n【27】 ## Prognosis - The prognosis of seborrheic dermatitis is excellent in infants; it is a self limited disease and usually resolves within few months after birth.\n- In adults, it is a recurrent condition with no permanent cure.\n\n【28】 #Diagnosis\nThere is no definitive diagnostic criteria for seborrheic dermatitis. Diagnosis of seborrheic dermatitis is primarily clinical; it is based on history and physical examination findings.\n\n【29】 #History\nObtaining complete  history is important in making diagnosis of seborrheic dermatitis as it will give an insight into cause and associated risk factors for the disease. In addition to symptoms of seborrheic dermatitis, patients may present with symptoms of one of the following associated conditions:\n- Parkinsonism\n- Epilepsy\n- Depressive mood disorder\n- Traumatic brain injury\n- Spinal cord injury\n- HIV\n- Lymphoma - Downs syndrome\n- Hailey-Hailey Disease\n- Diabetes mellitus\n\n【30】 #Symptoms\nSymptoms of seborrheic dermatitis may be categorized according to age as follows:\n\n【31】 ## Infants\nInfants usually present in the first few months of life. Symptoms can be divided into following types depending on extent of involvement.\n- Localized\nRedness and flaking\nPruritis\nMost common sites involved are scalp and face\nOther sites involved include retroauricular area, nasolabial folds, cheeks, eyebrows and eyelids\nNapkin or diaper area involvement\n- Generalized\nFew cases may present with generalized involvement such as lower abdomen, groin and pubic area.\n\n【32】 ## Adults\nThe most common symptoms of seborrheic dermatitis may be divided into two types based on extent of involvement:\n- Localized\nMacules, thin plaques, or red patches(scalp, face, nasolabial folds, anterior hairline, eyebrows, glabella region of the forehead, melolabial folds, ears, central chest, and genital region)\nPruritis\nFine scaling (mild cases)\nRedness and yellow to white crusting or scaling (severe disease)\nRepeated itching of ear causing secondary bacterial infection resulting in fever and ear pain.\n- Redness, itching and yellow crusting of eye lashes (Blepharitis).\n- Generalized\nPatients with HIV or other immunosupressive conditions such as malignancies usually present with more severe disease involving unusual sites such as extremities.\n\n【33】 #Physical Examination\nPhysical examination may be divided into two types according to age group:\n\n【34】 ## Imaging Findings\nThere are no imaging findings associated with  seborrheic dermatitis.\n\n【35】 ## Other Diagnostic Studies\nThere are no other diagnostic studies for seborrheic dermatitis.\n\n【36】 #Treatment\nThe mainstay of treatment for seborrheic dermatitis is medical therapy. Depending on age and severity of symptoms the treatment may be categorized as follows:\nThe following are the preferred treatment regimens for seborrheic dermatitis:\n- 1. Antifungal agents\n- Preferred regimen : Ketoconazole 2% in shampoo, foam, gel, or cream\n- Scalp: Twice/week for clearance THEN once/week or every other week for maintenance\n- Other areas: From bid to twice/week for clearance THEN from twice/week to once every other week for maintenance\n- Other areas: qd for clearance\n- 2.

NAC provides professional leadership in assisting in identifying, designing and implementing cost-effective blood utilization management initiatives for the optimization of patient care throughout Canada.\nS/D Plasma is currently licensed in Canada under the name of Octaplasma. It is virus inactivated S/D treated human frozen plasma with resulting coagulation activity levels similar to those in single-donor fresh frozen plasma. S/D Plasma treatment is not effective against non-enveloped viruses. For the solvent detergent treatment process, large pools of plasma are treated and then divided into individual units. This pooling and separating lowers the level of proteins in the individual units that cause allergic and immunologic reactions as demonstrated by lower rates of adverse events in hem vigilance studies.\nIn 2011, the PTs approved the funding and distribution S/D Plasma by CBS for specific patient groups as recommended by the CADTH Panel of Experts in the \"Optimal Therapy Recommendation for the Use of Solvent/Detergent-Treated Human Plasma\". The original CADTH review was based on systematic review of literature and included an economic (risk-benefit) analysis. Subsequently, the PTBLC requested that NAC develop a further framework to enable the distribution and handling of S/D Plasma, and collaborate with CBS to identify a suitable mechanism by which S/D Plasma would routinely be available for the specific patient groups identified. This NAC Framework for Appropriate Use and Distribution of S/D Plasma provides an update to the 2015 NAC framework document.\nAt the request of the PTBLC, CADTH completed two evidence-based literature reviews in 2017 related to the use of S/D plasma. These reviews of the literature found no new evidence for the use of S/D plasma in TTP and plasmapheresis, respectively. The original economic (risk-benefit) analysis was not updated. Thus, the PT approved funding for S/D plasma has not been reevaluated and remains based on the original recommendations made by the CADTH Panel of Experts.\nIn this current revision of the NAC framework document, the specific indications for S/D plasma have been updated by NAC to reflect both current medical practice and the principles outlined by the CADTH expert panel.\nThe CADTH Panel of Experts recommended S/D plasma for patients receiving high volume plasma transfusions. The specific indications included only patients with TTP, HUS with factor H mutations and patients with clotting factor deficiencies. In the setting of TTP and HUS, patients receive high volume plasma transfusions as part of plasmapheresis treatment. However, plasmapheresis with plasma replacement is indicated in other clinical settings, including (but not limited to) atypical HUS without factor H mutations. Following the principles outlined by the CADTH expert panel and the bioethical principle of justice, NAC recommends that all patients receiving plasmapheresis with plasma replacement should be eligible to receive S/D plasma as per the revised indications below.\nThe 2015 NAC framework also allowed for medical review of individual cases not meeting the CADTH expert criteria. In this update, we have provided further guidance on the specifics for which approval for S/D plasma should be considered. These would include cases where ABO compatible plasma is not available, and rare cases of patients with previous life-threatening adverse reactions to standard plasma\nAs part of the request process of S/D plasma, all requests from treating physicians should be reviewed by local transfusion medicine experts for completeness and appropriateness.\nOngoing monitoring of S/D Plasma should continue as a means of mitigating the potential for escalating costs associated with the use of this product outside of the current recommendation. Should utilization of S/D Plasma be observed to deviate from the outlined recommendations, the PTs will review the data and follow-up with the respective hospital(s) as appropriate.\nThe process by which S/D Plasma is available to patients is supported by the PT Ministries of Health.\n\n【1】 #RECOMMENDATIONS\n- CBS should retain the inventory of S/D Plasma for all jurisdictions in Canada (with the exception of Quebec) and distribute it to requesting hospitals for patients with indications in accordance with this framework.  All requests for S/D Plasma should be reviewed by a local/regional transfusion expert prior to submitting a product request to Canadian Blood Services.  Requests received by CBS shall be reviewed in accordance with the approved indications by Canadian Blood Services o Requests for S/D plasma outside of the specific indications will be reviewed by a CBS transfusion medical director in consultation with local/regional transfusion expert(s) on individual case basis.  Distribution and utilization of S/D Plasma should continue to be monitored. Product disposition shall be reported by hospitals to CBS, with data compiled for reporting to the PTBLC  S/D plasma requests shall be subject to the approval process outlined in  and the use of an associated CBS product request form .\n\n【2】 #INDICATIONS\nThe following revised criteria are based on the criteria originally published in the CADTH report dated May 2011. These revised criteria reflect changes in clinical practice, but follow the principles from the initial recommendations by the CADTH Panel of Experts.\nS/D Plasma should be considered for:\n- Patients who require a high volume or chronic plasma transfusions (primary qualifier) because they have: a. Congenital TTP or, b. A need for plasmapheresis with plasma as a replacement fluid for conditions such as (but not limited to) acquired TTP and HUS or, c. Clotting factor deficiencies for which specific licensed concentrates may not be readily available (e.g. factor V, factor XI).\nAnd who have one of the following secondary qualifiers:  Have experienced a recurrent clinically significant allergic reaction to plasma  Have an existing lung disorder that would make them more susceptible to effects of TRALI reaction.\nAny patient who requires plasma but a blood group compatible product is not available in a timely manner. 3. Patients who have had a previous life-threatening reaction to plasma that could be avoided by the use of S/D plasma, where no alternative therapies are available.\nPlasma should be interpreted as any plasma product, e.g.: FFPA, FP, and Cryosupernatant Plasma.\nRequests outside the above listed would be subject to review by local transfusion medicine experts and Canadian Blood Services.\nAn allergic reaction is that which is defined by the TTISS, Public Health Agency of Canada:\na. Minor -a skin reaction characterized by a transient urticarial or other skin rash with pruritus associated with the transfusion. This reaction may be associated with localized angioedema without respiratory distress. b. Severe/Anaphylactic/ Anaphylactoid -in addition to mucocutaneous signs/symptoms there is airway compromise or severe hypotension requiring vasopressor treatment. The respiratory signs/symptoms may be laryngeal (tightness in the throat, dysphagia, dysphoria, hoarseness, strider) or pulmonary (dyspnea, cough, wheezing /bronchospasm, hypoxemia). c. Anaphylactic Shock -in addition to the above mentioned, profound hypotension with loss of consciousness, circulatory collapse or death.\n\n【3】 S/D Plasma is available in 200 mL bags. Administration, dosing and monitoring should be similar to that of frozen plasma, in adherence with existing local transfusion policies and dependent on the clinical situation.\nAdverse reactions observed in patients being treated with S/D Plasma should be reported to Health Canada through the Canada Vigilance Program  and the manufacturer, as per local standard process.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

It is recommended only if the company provides mogamulizumab according to the commercial arrangement.\nMogamulizumab is recommended as an option for treating mycosis fungoides in adults, only if:\ntheir condition is stage 2B or above and they have had at least 2 systemic treatments and the company provides mogamulizumab according to the commercial arrangement.\nThis recommendation is not intended to affect treatment with mogamulizumab that was started in the NHS before this guidance was published. People having treatment outside this recommendation may continue without change to the funding arrangements in place for them before this guidance was published, until they and their NHS clinician consider it appropriate to stop.\nWhy the committee made these recommendations\nStandard care for previously treated mycosis fungoides or Sézary syndrome includes brentuximab vedotin, methotrexate, bexarotene, peginterferon and chemotherapy.\nMogamulizumab has not been directly compared with standard care used in the NHS. It has only been directly compared with vorinostat, which is not available in the UK. Indirectly comparing mogamulizumab with evidence from people having standard care in the NHS suggests that people are likely to live longer with mogamulizumab. The evidence from this indirect comparison is uncertain because all the different factors that affect clinical outcomes may not have been considered. But it is unlikely that the evidence can be improved so the uncertainty is considered acceptable.\n\n【3】 #Marketing authorisation indication\nMogamulizumab (Poteligeo, Kyowa Kirin) is indicated for 'the treatment of adult patients with mycosis fungoides or Sézary syndrome who have received at least one prior systemic therapy'.\n\n【4】 #Dosage in the marketing authorisation\nThe dosage schedule is available in the summary of product characteristics.\n\n【5】 The list price of mogamulizumab is £1,329 per vial containing 4 mg of mogamulizumab per ml (excluding VAT; BNF online, accessed October 2021). The company has a commercial arrangement (simple discount patient access scheme). This makes mogamulizumab available to the NHS with a discount. The size of the discount is commercial in confidenc\n\n【6】 #Committee discussion\n\n【7】 ## People with mycosis fungoides or Sézary syndrome would welcome a new treatment option\nCutaneous T-cell lymphoma is a rare type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that affects the skin. It includes mycosis fungoides, the most common type, and Sézary syndrome, which is closely related. The clinical experts explained that Sézary syndrome is an aggressive disease and prognosis tends to be poor. Both patient experts described how living with a scaly itching rash all the time significantly affects their health-related quality of life. Sleep is affected. Cracks and open wounds are common, particularly on the hands and feet, which limits the ability to walk and carry out daily activities. The clinical experts explained that the disease particularly affects people's appearance and people sometimes rely on carers to help with daily activities. They confirmed that the treatments recommended in the British Association of Dermatologists and UK Cutaneous Lymphoma Group guidelines on managing primary cutaneous lymphomas after at least 1 systemic treatment were used in clinical practice. These included brentuximab vedotin, methotrexate, bexarotene, peginterferon and chemotherapy. The patient experts said that treatments such as chemotherapy had little benefit but mogamulizumab had a dramatic improvement. Mogamulizumab improved their itching and skin condition, so they could carry out daily activities more easily, and considerably improved their quality of life. The committee concluded that people with mycosis fungoides or Sézary syndrome who have had at least 1 systemic treatment would welcome an additional treatment option.\n\n【8】 ## The company proposes mogamulizumab for a subgroup of the population covered by the marketing authorisation\nMogamulizumab is indicated for treating mycosis fungoides or Sézary syndrome after at least 1 systemic treatment . For the first and second committee meetings, the company proposed mogamulizumab as an option for a subgroup of the population covered by the marketing authorisation; that is, after at least 1 systemic treatment for people with severe disease that has progressed with brentuximab vedotin or if it is not appropriate. Severe disease was defined as stage 2B and above for mycosis fungoides and all stages of Sézary syndrome. Brentuximab vedotin is recommended as an option for severe CD30‑positive disease after at least 1 treatment . The committee understood that mogamulizumab would most likely be used as an option after 1 systemic treatment for CD30-negative disease and after 2 systemic treatments for CD30-positive disease. But it noted that brentuximab could also be used later in the treatment pathway. The clinical experts explained that around 15% to 20% of people have CD30-positive disease. After the appeal, the company further refined the positioning of mogamulizumab for advanced mycosis fungoides to adults who have had 2 or more systemic treatments. It maintained the positioning in Sézary syndrome for adults who have had 1 or more systemic treatments. Few people with Sézary syndrome have CD30-positive disease. So, this positioning means that in both conditions, most people will have had brentuximab vedotin, or it will be unsuitable. The company explained that this is the population with the greatest unmet need because the only treatment options available to them are repeating previous treatments or clinical trials. The clinical experts confirmed that the company's proposed subgroup with severe disease was clinically relevant and that people in this subgroup had limited treatment options. The committee considered that there was a very high unmet need in this population. The committee concluded that the company positioned mogamulizumab for a subgroup of the population covered by the marketing authorisation and it would account for this in its recommendations.\n\n【9】 ## Standard care is the most appropriate comparator\nThe company originally submitted cost-effectiveness analyses, which used clinical-effectiveness data comparing mogamulizumab with vorinostat, a treatment that is not licensed or used in the UK . In its revised base case after technical engagement, the company included the costs of having bexarotene alone for everyone in the standard care arm. This is because it considered it to be the most common NHS treatment for mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome. A clinical expert explained that triple therapy with bexarotene, extracorporeal photopheresis and peginterferon is used in clinical practice. But bexarotene alone would not generally be used, particularly for Sézary syndrome, because it was not effective. Another clinical expert suggested that chemotherapy may also be an option for people who were eligible for mogamulizumab. The committee considered that the company's approach may oversimplify a complex treatment pathway. The company also submitted clinical-effectiveness data for standard care from the hospital episode statistics (HES) database, including other relevant treatments in the standard care arm. These included methotrexate, bexarotene, peginterferon and chemotherapy. Overall, the committee concluded that standard care was the most appropriate comparator.\n\n【10】 ## There is no trial evidence comparing mogamulizumab with standard care\nThe clinical evidence for mogamulizumab came from MAVORIC, a phase 3, open-label, randomised controlled trial. MAVORIC compared mogamulizumab with vorinostat in 372 adults with stage 1B to 4B relapsed or refractory mycosis fungoides or Sézary syndrome. There was no evidence directly comparing mogamulizumab with treatments currently used as NHS standard care . In NICE's technology appraisal guidance on brentuximab vedotin for treating CD30-positive cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, the ALCANZA trial was used. It compared brentuximab with the physician's choice of treatment (methotrexate or bexarotene). The committee understood that:\nAn anchored indirect treatment comparison using ALCANZA was not possible because there was no common treatment to connect the 2 trials.\nThe population in ALCANZA was different to MAVORIC because people with Sézary syndrome were excluded, everyone had CD30‑positive disease, and some had primary cutaneous anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (a subtype of cutaneous T‑cell lymphoma).\nThere was a high level of crossover in ALCANZA and the company did not have access to individual patient-level data to calculate crossover-adjusted survival estimates for the comparator arm.The company assumed that vorinostat was a suitable proxy for standard care in the NHS based on:\nsimilar progression-free survival to the physician's choice arm in ALCANZA\nclinical expert opinion and similar response rates to those seen in bexarotene clinical trials.The ERG explained that if vorinostat and the physician's choice were similar, people in the physician's choice arm in ALCANZA would have longer progression-free survival and overall survival because they had less severe disease. However, overall survival for the physician's choice arm was shorter than with vorinostat. The clinical experts could not comment on vorinostat's clinical effectiveness because it is not available in the UK. However, they emphasised that mogamulizumab had been shown to be effective in delaying disease progression and improving quality of life both in the trial and in their clinical experience. The committee noted that:\nmogamulizumab improved progression-free survival in MAVORIC compared with vorinostat (hazard ratio 0.43, 95% confidence interval 0.31 to 0.58)\nthe overall survival estimates were uncertain because MAVORIC was not powered to detect overall survival differences\n% of people in the severe disease subgroup crossed over from vorinostat to mogamulizumab, so crossover adjustment was needed .Overall, the committee was concerned about using these clinical-effectiveness data because vorinostat was not licensed for use in the UK and did not represent NHS standard care. The committee considered that evidence for the relative effectiveness of mogamulizumab was limited and concluded that evidence from clinical trials, used to estimate the relative treatment effect of mogamulizumab, was highly uncertain compared with NHS standard care.\n\n【11】 ## HES data suggests that mogamulizumab is likely more effective than standard care but the evidence is uncertain\nReal-world data from England's HES database was presented by the company at the first committee meeting and used to support its preferred approach to extrapolating survival for the comparator arm from MAVORIC . After consultation, the company submitted an unanchored indirect treatment comparison comparing mogamulizumab outcomes from MAVORIC with HES data. The committee noted that, unlike the MAVORIC data , the HES data did not need any crossover adjustment. The committee noted that NICE's Decision Support Unit technical support document 18 states that all effect modifiers and prognostic factors should be accounted for in an unanchored indirect treatment comparison. This is because 'failure of this assumption leads to an unknown amount of bias' in the comparison. It noted that the MAVORIC data was only matched to the HES data for the proportion of people with mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome. Age (a known prognostic factor) and sex (which can potentially affect survival) were not matched. This was because the company considered that these were similar between the MAVORIC and HES data and wanted to avoid reducing the sample size unnecessarily. The ERG explained that age and sex should have been matched and pointed out that differences in mean age increased by 2.5 years after matching. After the appeal, the company submitted a scenario analysis including age and sex, which had a negligible effect on the hazard ratio for overall survival. The hazard ratio for overall survival, adjusted for age and sex, was 0.38 (95% confidence interval 0.25 to 0.59), showing mogamulizumab was associated with an improvement in overall survival compared with standard care. The committee was aware that several additional prognostic factors recognised in the literature and in a study by the Cutaneous Lymphoma International Consortium included:\nstage of disease levels of lactate dehydrogenase and large-cell transformation.However, information on these and other prognostic factors were not available in the HES database and so could not be matched. The company considered that, in the HES database, people having systemic therapy had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) stage of 1 or less and adequate haematological, liver and kidney function. But no evidence to support this was provided. The committee noted that there were important limitations to using proxies for the stage and the duration of disease. Overall, the committee recognised that the HES analysis addressed some of the issues with the original submission and commended the company on its efforts. But the limitations of the data and the lack of information on prognostic factors meant that the indirect analysis results were uncertain. The committee considered that although there were uncertainties in the indirect comparison it was unlikely that these could have been addressed. The committee concluded that the indirect comparison suggested that mogamulizumab was more effective than standard care but that the evidence was uncertain.\n\n【12】 ## The MAVORIC subgroup with severe disease is clinically relevant but the results create uncertainty\nThe company used clinical-effectiveness data from a post-hoc subgroup of 287 people with severe disease in MAVORIC to reflect its proposed positioning . The committee recalled that severe disease was considered a clinically relevant subgroup. But it noted that in this subgroup, it could not easily determine the proportion of people who had disease progression after brentuximab vedotin (CD30‑positive disease) and those not eligible for brentuximab vedotin (CD30‑negative disease). It was also concerned that the clinical-effectiveness data included people at different stages in the treatment pathway and did not differentiate between mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome. It considered that this may not be appropriate given the differences in expected survival between the conditions. The committee would have liked to have seen separate analyses by disease type and line of treatment. It recalled that all analyses used vorinostat as a comparator, which did not represent NHS standard care . After the appeal, the company reweighted the MAVORIC trial data to match the characteristics of the subgroup of the population covered by the marketing authorisation, as observed in the HES data. Based on the evidence, the committee concluded that the MAVORIC subgroup with severe disease was clinically relevant. But using a mixed population, which grouped several lines of treatment together, created uncertainty. Also, MAVORIC did not compare mogamulizumab with a relevant comparator.\n\n【13】 ## The company's model structure is acceptable\nIn the company's partitioned survival model, 3 different treatment pathways were modelled:\npeople who did not have an allogeneic stem cell transplant people who had an allogeneic stem cell transplant after current treatment (that is, mogamulizumab or standard care)\npeople who had an allogeneic stem cell transplant after subsequent treatment.The company initially used clinical expert advice to estimate the proportion of people having an allogeneic stem cell transplant after current treatment because this was not allowed in MAVORIC. After consultation, the company used HES data  for this proportion. The committee was aware that the estimated treatment effect in MAVORIC may have differed if allogeneic stem cell transplant had been allowed. It recognised that some people may have an allogeneic stem cell transplant in clinical practice. But in the model, it preferred removing allogeneic stem cell transplant after current treatment, to avoid double-counting survival benefit in MAVORIC and to reduce potential bias. After the appeal, the company excluded allogeneic stem cell transplant after current treatment. The company noted that by doing this, the standard care arm included some of the benefits of allogeneic stem cell transplant but none of the costs. The committee considered that the cost-effectiveness estimates might have been lower if the costs of allogeneic stem cell transplant after current treatment were included in the submission. It understood that this had a small effect on the cost-effectiveness estimates. The committee concluded that the company's economic model structure was acceptable and that allogeneic stem cell transplant after current treatment should be excluded from the model.\n\n【14】 ## The comparative evidence from MAVORIC for time on treatment and next-treatment free survival is appropriate for decision making\nThe company originally modelled standard care using MAVORIC clinical-effectiveness data because it considered that vorinostat could be used as a proxy for standard care . In its revised base case after technical engagement, the company preferred to use the costs of bexarotene alone for 48 weeks to represent the likely costs for people who have NHS standard care. After consultation, the company reverted to the ERG's preferred assumption of using the time on treatment for vorinostat and for relevant standard care treatments. In addition, clinical-effectiveness data for the standard care arm was updated to reflect data from the HES analysis . After the appeal, the company estimated next-treatment-free survival and time on treatment for both arms from the reweighted MAVORIC trial, focusing on the refined population. The committee heard that the ERG agreed with the company's choice of distribution for next-treatment-free survival and using Kaplan–Meier curves to estimate time on treatment. Despite the limitations in the data sources, the committee concluded that the data was the most appropriate for decision making.\n\n【15】 ## The exponential curve for both arms is acceptable for decision making\nIn MAVORIC, 72% of people in the severe subgroup crossed over from vorinostat to mogamulizumab after disease progression. Therefore, overall survival in the vorinostat arm was heavily confounded. The ERG and company agreed that an adjustment was needed to estimate what would have happened in the comparator arm if there was no crossover. In the first 2 committee meetings, the company preferred to use the inverse probability of censoring weights (IPCW) method and the ERG preferred a 2‑stage estimation method to adjust for crossover. Alongside the company's preferred IPCW crossover adjustment, it chose a log-normal curve to extrapolate overall survival in the mogamulizumab arm and applied an exponential curve to the standard care arm. The ERG preferred the exponential curve for both treatment arms. The committee preferred the ERG's approach and agreed that the company would need to make a strong case to justify using different parametric curves in each treatment arm. After the appeal, the company estimated overall survival for the mogamulizumab arm from the reweighted MAVORIC trial. The company and ERG agreed that the exponential extrapolation in the mogamulizumab arm was the best fitting curve and was clinically plausible. The company also updated the data source for overall survival in the standard care arm to the HES data after the appeal. The company chose the exponential extrapolation to estimate overall survival in the standard care arm. The company explained that although the generalised gamma was the best fitting curve, it did not consider the extrapolation to be clinically plausible because it predicted a plateau in survival. The ERG noted that the exponential extrapolation was the best fitting curve for the mogamulizumab arm but the worst fitting curve for the standard care arm. So, the ERG preferred the log-normal extrapolation because it was the second-best fitting extrapolation. The log-normal curve showed that 10% of people who had standard care would be alive at 10 years. The clinical experts explained that only people who had allogeneic stem cell transplants would be alive at 10 years. The clinical experts added that people whose disease progresses and need second- and third-line treatments do not have a good prognosis and would not be long-term survivors. The committee agreed with the company and clinical experts that because the modelling did not include people who have had allogeneic stem cell transplant, the log-normal curve was not clinically plausible. The committee concluded that the company and ERG's preferred exponential curve for the mogamulizumab arm and the company's preferred exponential curve for the standard care arm were acceptable for decision making.\n\n【16】 ## A 2-year stopping rule is not appropriate\nThe company included a 2‑year stopping rule for mogamulizumab in its revised base case. There was no evidence to support a stopping rule because it was not included in either the summary of product characteristics or the MAVORIC trial. The committee understood that the estimated treatment effect could have differed if a stopping rule had been used. The company suggested that the treatment effect was unlikely to differ substantially because in MAVORIC, only a small proportion of people had mogamulizumab after 2 years (the data is confidential and cannot be reported here). The committee recalled that it was not convinced that there would be a prolonged treatment benefit after stopping treatment. Before technical engagement, 1 clinical expert suggested that a 2‑year stopping rule would not be appropriate if people were still benefitting from treatment. At the committee meeting, the clinical experts explained that treatment would not normally be stopped if it was tolerated and there was an ongoing clinical benefit. The patient experts said they would feel distressed if mogamulizumab was stopped at 2 years, leaving them without any effective treatment options. The committee concluded that a 2‑year stopping rule was not appropriate.\n\n【17】 ## There may be an effect on carers' health-related quality of life, but this cannot be robustly modelled\nThe committee recalled that people with this condition sometimes rely on help from informal carers . The committee noted that some people would have help from district nurses (for example, with wound dressing). Also, costs for community-based care including home visits, skin and wound care and dressings were included in the model. In the first and second committee meetings, the company's base case modelled the effect of caring on the health-related quality of life of carers by applying an additional utility gain of 0.19 when a person is in the disease control health state. This was the difference between the direct estimates of carer's health-related quality of life when caring for someone in the disease control (0.56) and subsequent treatment states (0.37) from the company's vignette study. Therefore, only the additional time a person spent in the disease control state after having mogamulizumab compared with standard care contributed to improving carer's health-related quality of life. After consultation, the company submitted 2 scenarios for carer utilities, in which:\nthe difference between carer utilities for the disease control and subsequent treatment health states was the same as the difference seen for the people in the trial (0.09)\nabsolute values for disease control and subsequent treatment states were used to show that the base case reflected a conservative approach.\n\n【18】 ## Mogamulizumab is not considered to be a life-extending treatment at the end of life\nThe committee considered the advice about life-extending treatments for people with a short life expectancy in NICE's guide to the methods of technology appraisal. At the first meeting, using MAVORIC data with the company's preferences, the model predicted a median survival of 21 months and a mean survival of 37 months in the standard care arm. The committee's preferred assumptions predicted a mean survival of between 33 months and 59 months in the standard care arm depending on if an IPCW or 2‑stage estimation crossover adjustment was used. The company also submitted HES data, which showed a median overall survival of around 1.3 years for people who have had 1 treatment. After consultation, the company submitted an updated HES analysis  and considered that the end of life criteria had been met. The committee recognised that median life expectancy based on the new HES analysis (17.83 months) was less than 24 months. However, it noted that the mean extrapolated discounted and undiscounted life years in the standard care arm of the cost-effectiveness model based on the HES data, were 2.87 and 3.31 years respectively. The committee also considered a study by the Cutaneous Lymphoma International Consortium and the professional organisations' responses to technical engagement. After the appeal, the committee reconsidered this data and noted that the median data from the Cutaneous Lymphoma International Consortium study and the professional organisations' responses to technical engagement referred to time from diagnosis, rather than time from eligibility for second-line treatment. The committee acknowledged that time from eligibility for second-line treatment was the relevant period that should have been considered. After the appeal, the company updated the data source for overall survival in the standard care arm to the HES data. In the refined population, the HES data showed that median overall survival from time from eligibility for second-line treatment was 13 months but when the HES data was used in the model, it showed that mean overall survival was 28 months, when the exponential curve was chosen for both treatment arms. The committee noted that all other extrapolations of the HES data in the model led to a mean life expectancy greater than 28 months. The committee remained concerned about the differences between the median overall survival results from the HES analysis and the mean results produced when it was used in the model. The company considered that the mean was skewed by the long survival of around 10% of people having allogeneic stem cell transplant after current and subsequent treatments in the HES dataset. The ERG noted that people who had allogeneic stem cell transplant were part of the same cohort for which life expectancy was estimated, so their long survival does not bias life expectancy. The clinical experts explained that the life expectancy of people with the condition is variable and both the mean and median figures could be plausible. The committee recalled that cost-effectiveness results and decisions are based on mean quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs. So, the committee still considered that the best estimate of expected survival came from modelling mean life expectancy. The committee noted that NICE's guide to the methods of technology appraisal states that the appraisal committee must be satisfied that:\nOverall, the committee was not convinced there was robust evidence that the short life-expectancy criterion had been met. It concluded that mogamulizumab could not be considered a life-extending treatment at the end of life.\n\n【19】 ## An acceptable ICER is towards the upper end of the range normally considered cost effective\nNICE's guide to the methods of technology appraisal notes that above a most plausible incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £20,000 per QALY gained, judgements about the acceptability of a technology as an effective use of NHS resources will take into account the degree of certainty around the ICER. The committee will be more cautious about recommending a technology if it is less certain about the ICERs presented. The committee noted the high level of uncertainty associated with the MAVORIC analysis, specifically:\nThe relative treatment effect of mogamulizumab compared with NHS standard care was uncertain because MAVORIC did not include the most appropriate comparator for NHS standard care .\nThe company's preferred subgroup was limited because it included a mixed population in a single post-hoc analysis .But it acknowledged that the HES analysis addressed some of the issues associated with MAVORIC (for example, comparator and crossover adjustment), and the rarity of the conditions means it would be hard to collect further data to reduce the uncertainty. It also recalled that including carer utilities and the costs of allogeneic stem cell transplant in the standard care arm would likely decrease the ICER. The committee noted that considering carer utilities and the costs of allogeneic stem cell transplant in the standard care arm would offset some uncertainty around the cost-effectiveness analyses. The committee therefore agreed that an ICER towards the upper end of the range normally considered a cost-effective use of NHS resources (£20,000 to £30,000 per QALY gained) would be acceptable.\n\n【20】 ## The cost-effectiveness estimates are uncertain but are within the range normally considered cost effective\nAfter the appeal, the company's updated base-case ICER for mogamulizumab compared with standard care was £28,233 per QALY gained, including the commercial arrangement for mogamulizumab. Adjusting the baseline characteristics of the MAVORIC trial to match the refined population had a minimal impact on the ICER. The committee understood that there was a small effect on the ICERs when including the commercial arrangement for bexarotene but the exact data is confidential so cannot be reported here. The committee considered the company's base case suitable for decision making. The company's base case included:\nclinical-effectiveness data for overall survival for standard care from the unanchored indirect comparison using real-world data from the HES analysis and reweighted MAVORIC data the exponential curve to extrapolate overall survival for mogamulizumab and standard care allogeneic stem cell transplant excluded after current treatment.The company's base case excluded carer health-related quality of life. The committee considered the substantial uncertainty in all the cost-effectiveness estimates when applied in an NHS setting but noted the rarity of the cancer being appraised. The committee agreed that, based on its preferred assumptions, the most plausible ICER was within the range it considered acceptable for this appraisal . The committee concluded that mogamulizumab was cost effective for advanced mycosis fungoides after at least 2 previous systemic treatments and for Sézary syndrome after at least 1 previous systemic treatment.\n\n【21】 ## Benefits not captured in the model are considered in the committee's decision making\nThe company considered mogamulizumab to be innovative because there are limited effective treatment options for people with advanced mycosis fungoides after at least 2 previous systemic treatments and for people with Sézary syndrome after at least 1 previous systemic treatment. The company emphasised the importance of improved health-related quality of life for these conditions, which cause lesions that affect people's appearance. The committee recalled this, the reported benefits in improving symptoms and the burden on carers. The committee also noted that the benefits of allogeneic stem cell transplant in the standard care arm were included in the modelling, but the associated costs were not. So, the committee was willing to qualitatively consider these factors. It also noted that mogamulizumab has an innovative mechanism of action. The committee concluded that mogamulizumab is innovative and the relevant benefits associated with mogamulizumab that were not captured in the modelling were considered qualitatively in determining an acceptable ICER .", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

SIMCOR may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Serum cholesterol and triglycerides increase during normal pregnancy, and cholesterol or cholesterol derivatives are essential for fetal development. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process and discontinuation of lipid-lowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on long-term outcomes of primary hypercholesterolemia therapy. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of SIMCOR use during pregnancy; however in rare reports congenital anomalies were observed following intrauterine exposure to HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. If SIMCOR is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus .

Common adverse reactions include injection site reaction, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, flatulence, indigestion, nausea, xerostomia, dizziness, headache.\n\n【2】 ### General Information\n- Esomeprazole sodium for Injection should not be administered concomitantly with any other medications through the same intravenous site and/or tubing. The intravenous line should always be flushed with either 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, Lactated Ringer’s Injection, USP or 5% Dextrose Injection, USP both prior to and after administration of esomeprazole sodium for Injection.\nNo refrigeration is required.\n- Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.\n- As soon as oral therapy is possible or appropriate, intravenous therapy with esomeprazole sodium for Injection should be discontinued and the therapy should be continued orally.\n\n【3】 ### GERD with Erosive Esophagitis - Dosing information\n- Recommended adult dosage:  20 mg or 40 mg IV injection qd  (no less than 3 minutes) or IV infusion (10 minutes to 30 minutes). Safety and efficacy of esomeprazole sodium for injection as a treatment of GERD patients with erosive esophagitis for more than 10 days have not been demonstrated.\n- Dosage adjustment is not required in patients with mild to moderate liver impairment (child Pugh Classes A and B). For patients with severe liver impairment (child Pugh Class C), - Maximum dosage: 20 mg IV qd\n\n【4】 ### Risk Reduction of Rebleeding of Gastric or Duodenal Ulcer following  Therapeutic Endoscopy in Adults\n- Dosing information\n- 80 mg administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes followed by a continuous infusion of 8 mg/h for a total treatment duration of 72 hours (i.e. includes initial 30-minute dose plus 71.5 hours of continuous infusion).\n- Intravenous therapy is aimed solely at the acute initial management of bleeding gastric or duodenal ulcers and does not constitute full treatment. Intravenous therapy should be followed by oral acid-suppressive therapy.\n- For patients with liver impairment\n- No dosage adjustment of the initial esomeprazole 80 mg infusion is necessary.\n- For patients with mild to moderate liver impairment (Child Pugh Classes A and B), a maximum continuous infusion of esomeprazole 6 mg/h should not be exceeded.\n\n【5】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Esomeprazole sodium in adult patients.\n\n【6】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Esomeprazole sodium in adult patients.\n\n【7】 ### GERD with Erosive Esophagitis - Dose should be infused over 10 minutes to 30 minutes.\n- 1 year to 17 years:\n- Body weight less than 55 kg: 10 mg\n- 1 month to less than 1 year of age: 0.5 mg/kg\n\n【8】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Esomeprazole sodium in pediatric patients.\n\n【9】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Esomeprazole sodium in pediatric patients.\n\n【10】 #Contraindications\nPatients with known hypersensitivity to any component of the formulation or to substituted benzimidazoles (angioedema and anaphylaxis have occurred).\n\n【11】 ## Risk of Concomitant Gastric Malignancy\n- Symptomatic response to therapy with esomeprazole sodium does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy.\n\n【12】 ## Clostridium difficile Associated Diarrhea - Published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy like esomeprazole sodium may be associated with an increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea, especially in hospitalized patients. This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve.\n- Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated.\n\n【13】 ## Interaction with Clopidogrel\n- Avoid concomitant use of esomeprazole sodium with clopidogrel. clopidogrel is a prodrug. Inhibition of platelet aggregation by clopidogrel is entirely due to an active metabolite. The metabolism of clopidogrel to its active metabolite can be impaired by use with concomitant medications, such as esomeprazole, that inhibit CYP2C19 activity. Concomitant use of clopidogrel with 40 mg esomeprazole reduces the pharmacological activity of clopidogrel. When using esomeprazole sodium consider alternative anti-platelet therapy.\n\n【14】 ## Bone Fracture\n- Several published observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. The risk of fracture was increased in patients who received high-dose, defined as multiple daily doses, and long-term PPI therapy (a year or longer). Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures should be managed according to established treatment guidelines.\n\n【15】 ## Hypomagnesemia - Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least three months, in most cases after a year of therapy. Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures. In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI.\n- For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia (e.g. diuretics), health care professionals may consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of PPI treatment and periodically.\n\n【16】 ## Concomitant use of NEXIUM with St. John’s Wort or Rifampin\n- Drugs which induce CYP2C19 or CYP3A4 (such as St. John’s Wort or rifampin) can substantially decrease esomeprazole concentrations. Avoid concomitant use of NEXIUM with St. John’s Wort or rifampin.\n\n【17】 ## Interactions with Investigations for Neuroendocrine Tumors\n- Serum chromogranin A (CgA) levels increase secondary to drug-induced decreases in gastric acidity. The increased CgA level may cause false positive results in diagnostic investigations for neuroendocrine tumors. Healthcare providers should temporarily stop esomeprazole treatment at least 14 days before assessing CgA levels and consider repeating the test if initial CgA levels are high. If serial tests are performed ,e.g\n\n【18】 ## Concomitant use of NEXIUM with Methotrexate\n- Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. In high-dose methotrexate administration a temporary withdrawal of the PPI may be considered in some patients.\n\n【19】 ## Clinical Trials Experience with Intravenous Esomeprazole sodium\n- Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.\n- The safety of intravenous esomeprazole is based on results from clinical trials conducted in four different populations including patients having symptomatic GERD with or without a history of erosive esophagitis (n=199), patients with erosive esophagitis (n=160), healthy subjects (n=204) and patients with bleeding gastric or duodenal ulcers (n=375).\n\n【20】 ### Symptomatic GERD and Erosive Esophagitis Trials\n- The data described below reflect exposure to esomeprazole sodium for Injection in 359 patients. Esomeprazole sodium for Injection was studied only in actively-controlled trials. The population was 18 to 77 years of age; 45% Male, 52% Caucasian, 17% Black, 3% Asian, 28% Other, and had either erosive reflux esophagitis (44%) or GERD (56%). Most patients received doses of either 20 or 40 mg either as an infusion or an injection. Adverse reactions occurring in ≥1% of patients treated with intravenous esomeprazole (n=359) in clinical trials are listed below:\n- Intravenous treatment with esomeprazole 20 and 40 mg administered as an injection or as an infusion was found to have a safety profile similar to that of oral administration of esomeprazole.\nPediatric\n- A randomized, open-label, multi-national study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of repeated intravenous doses of once daily esomeprazole in pediatric patients 1 month to 17 years old, inclusive was performed. The safety results are consistent with the known safety profile of esomeprazole and no unexpected safety signals were identified.\n\n【21】 ### Risk Reduction of Rebleeding of Gastric or Duodenal Ulcers in Adults\n- The data described below reflect exposure to esomeprazole sodium for Injection in 375 patients. Esomeprazole sodium for Injection was studied in a placebo-controlled trial. Patients were randomized to receive esomeprazole sodium for Injection (n=375) or placebo (n=389). The population was 18 to 98 years old; 68% Male, 87% Caucasian, 1% Black, 7% Asian, 4% other, who presented with endoscopically confirmed gastric or duodenal ulcer bleeding. Following endoscopic hemostasis, patients received either 80 mg esomeprazole as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes followed by a continuous infusion of 8 mg per hour or placebo for a total treatment duration of 72 hours. After the initial 72-hour period, all patients received oral proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for 27 days.\n- With the exception of injection site reactions described above, intravenous treatment with esomeprazole administered as an injection or as an infusion was found to have a safety profile similar to that of oral administration of esomeprazole.\n\n【22】 ## Postmarketing Experience\n- The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of esomeprazole sodium. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.\n- Postmarketing Reports - There have been spontaneous reports of adverse events with postmarketing use of esomeprazole. These reports occurred rarely and are listed below by body system:\n- Blood And Lymphatic System Disorders: agranulocytosis, pancytopenia;\n- Eye Disorders: blurred vision;\n- Gastrointestinal Disorders: pancreatitis; stomatitis; microscopic colitis;\n- Hepatobiliary Disorders: hepatic failure, hepatitis with or without jaundice;\n- Immune System Disorders: anaphylactic reaction/shock;\n- Infections and Infestations: GI candidiasis;\n- Metabolism and nutritional disorders: hypomagnesemia with or without hypocalcemia and/or hypokalemia;\n- Musculoskeletal And Connective Tissue Disorders: muscular weakness, myalgia, bone fracture;\n- Nervous System Disorders: hepatic encephalopathy, taste disturbance;\n- Psychiatric Disorders: aggression, agitation, depression, hallucination;\n- Renal and Urinary Disorders: interstitial nephritis;\n- Reproductive System and Breast Disorders: gynecomastia;\n- Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: alopecia, erythema multiforme, hyperhidrosis, photosensitivity, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN, some fatal).\n- Other adverse events not observed with NEXIUM, but occurring with omeprazole can be found in the omeprazole package insert.\n\n【23】 #Drug Interactions\n- Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4.\n- In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that esomeprazole is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that esomeprazole does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin.\n- Post-marketing reports of changes in prothrombin measures have been received among patients on concomitant warfarin and esomeprazole therapy. Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death. Patients treated with proton pump inhibitors and warfarin concomitantly may need to be monitored for increases in INR and prothrombin time.\n- Esomeprazole may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major esomeprazole metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of esomeprazole 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate, resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam were observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. However, at that time, the plasma levels of diazepam were below the therapeutic interval, and thus this interaction is unlikely to be of clinical relevance.\n- Clopidogrel is metabolized to its active metabolite in part by CYP2C19.\n- Concomitant use of esomeprazole 40 mg results in reduced plasma concentrations of the active metabolite of clopidogrel and a reduction in platelet inhibition.\n- Omeprazole acts as an inhibitor of CYP2C19. Omeprazole, given in doses of 40 mg daily for one week to 20 healthy subjects in cross-over study, increased Cmax and AUC of cilostazol by 18% and 26%, respectively. Cmax and AUC of one of its active metabolites, 3,4-dihydro-cilostazol, which has 4-7 times the activity of cilostazol, were increased by 29% and 69%, respectively. Co-administration of cilostazol with esomeprazole is expected to increase concentrations of cilostazol and its above mentioned active metabolite. Therefore, a dose reduction of cilostazol from 100 mg twice daily to 50 mg twice daily should be considered.\n- Concomitant administration of esomeprazole and a combined inhibitor of CYP2C19 and CYP3A4, such as voriconazole, may result in more than doubling of the esomeprazole exposure. Dose adjustment of esomeprazole is not normally required for the recommended doses. However, in patients who may require higher doses, dose adjustment may be considered.\n- For some antiretroviral drugs, such as atazanavir and nelfinavir, decreased serum levels have been reported when given together with omeprazole. Following multiple doses of nelfinavir (1250 mg, twice daily) and omeprazole (40 mg daily), AUC was decreased by 36% and 92%, Cmax by 37% and 89% and Cmin by 39% and 75%, respectively, for nelfinavir and M8. Following multiple doses of atazanavir (400 mg daily) and omeprazole (40 mg daily, 2 hr before atazanavir), AUC was decreased by 94%, Cmax by 96%, and Cmin by 95%. Concomitant administration with omeprazole and drugs such as atazanavir and nelfinavir is therefore not recommended. For other antiretroviral drugs, such as saquinavir, elevated serum levels have been reported with an increase in AUC by 82%, in Cmax by 75% and in Cmin by 106% following multiple dosing of saquinavir/ritonavir (1000/100 mg) twice daily for 15 days with omeprazole 40 mg daily co-administered days 11 to 15. Dose reduction of saquinavir should be considered from the safety perspective for individual patients. There are also some antiretroviral drugs of which unchanged serum levels have been reported when given with omeprazole.\n- Studies evaluating concomitant administration of esomeprazole and either naproxen (non-selective NSAID) or rofecoxib (COX-2 selective NSAID) did not identify any clinically relevant changes in the pharmacokinetic profiles of esomeprazole or these NSAIDs.\n- Esomeprazole inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, esomeprazole may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability. Like with other drugs that decrease the intragastric acidity, the absorption of drugs such as ketoconazole, atazanavir, iron salts, and erlotinib can decrease, while the absorption of drugs such as digoxin can increase during treatment with esomeprazole. Concomitant treatment with omeprazole (20 mg daily) and digoxin in healthy subjects increased the bioavailability of digoxin by 10% (30% in two subjects). Esomeprazole is an enantiomer of omeprazole. Coadministration of digoxin with esomeprazole is expected to increase the systemic exposure of digoxin.\n- Therefore, patients may need to be monitored when digoxin is taken concomitantly with esomeprazole.\n\n【24】 ## Interactions with Investigations of Neuroendocrine Tumors\n- Drug-induced decrease in gastric acidity results in enterochromaffin-like cell hyperplasia and increased Chromogranin A levels which may interfere with investigations for neuroendocrine tumors.\n\n【25】 ## Tacrolimus\n- Concomitant administration of esomeprazole and tacrolimus may increase the serum levels of tacrolimus.\n\n【26】 ## Methotrexate\n- Case reports, published population pharmacokinetic studies, and retrospective analyses suggest that concomitant administration of PPIs and methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite hydroxymethotrexate.\n- However, no formal drug interaction studies of methotrexate with PPIs have been conducted.\n\n【27】 ### Pregnancy\nPregnancy Category (FDA): C\n\n【28】 ## Risk Summary\n- There are no adequate and well-controlled studies with NEXIUM in pregnant women. Esomeprazole is the s-isomer of omeprazole. Available epidemiologic data fail to demonstrate an increased risk of major congenital malformations or other adverse pregnancy outcomes with first trimester omeprazole use. Teratogenicity was not observed in animal reproduction studies with administration of oral esomeprazole magnesium in rats and rabbits with doses about 57 times and 35 times, respectively, an oral human dose of 40 mg. However, changes in bone morphology were observed in offspring of rats dosed through most of pregnancy and lactation at doses equal to or greater than approximately 33.6 times an oral human dose of 40 mg. Because of the observed effect at high doses of esomeprazole magnesium on developing bone in rat studies, NEXIUM should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\n\n【29】 ## Human Data - Esomeprazole is the S-isomer of omeprazole. Four epidemiological studies compared the frequency of congenital abnormalities among infants born to women who used omeprazole during pregnancy with the frequency of abnormalities among infants of women exposed to H2 receptor antagonists or other controls.\n- A population based retrospective cohort epidemiological study from the Swedish Medical Birth Registry, covering approximately 99% of pregnancies, from 1995-99, reported on 955 infants (824 exposed during the first trimester with 39 of these exposed beyond first trimester, and 131 exposed after the first trimester) whose mothers used omeprazole during pregnancy. The number of infants exposed in utero to omeprazole that had any malformation, low birth weight, low Apgar score, or hospitalization was similar to the number observed in this population. The number of infants born with ventricular septal defects and the number of stillborn infants was slightly higher in the omeprazole-exposed infants than the expected number in this population.\n- A retrospective cohort study reported on 689 pregnant women exposed to either H2 blockers or omeprazole in the first trimester (134 exposed to omeprazole) and 1,572 pregnant women unexposed to either during the first trimester. The overall malformation rate in offspring born to mothers with first trimester exposure to omeprazole, an H2-blocker, or were unexposed was 3.6%, 5.5%, and 4.1% respectively.\n\n【30】 ## Animal Data - Reproduction studies have been performed with esomeprazole magnesium in rats at oral doses up to 280 mg/kg/day (about 57 times an oral human dose of 40 mg on a body surface area basis) and in rabbits at oral doses up to 86 mg/kg/day (about 35 times the human dose on a body surface area basis) and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to esomeprazole magnesium.\n- A pre- and postnatal developmental toxicity study in rats with additional endpoints to evaluate bone development was performed with esomeprazole magnesium at oral doses of 14 to 280 mg/kg/day (about 3.4 to 57 times an oral human dose of 40 mg on a body surface area basis). Neonatal/early postnatal (birth to weaning) survival was decreased at doses equal to or greater than 138 mg/kg/day (about 33 times an oral human dose of 40 mg on a body surface area basis). Body weight and body weight gain were reduced and neurobehavioral or general developmental delays in the immediate post-weaning timeframe were evident at doses equal to or greater than 69 mg/kg/day (about 16.8 times an oral human dose of 40 mg on a body surface area basis). In addition, decreased femur length, width and thickness of cortical bone, decreased thickness of the tibial growth plate and minimal to mild bone marrow hypocellularity were noted at doses equal to or greater than 14 mg/kg/day (about 3.4 times an oral human dose of 40 mg on a body surface area basis). Physeal dysplasia in the femur was observed in offspring of rats treated with oral doses of esomeprazole magnesium at doses equal to or greater than 138 mg/kg/day (about 33.6 times an oral human dose of 40 mg on a body surface area basis).\n- Effects on maternal bone were observed in pregnant and lactating rats in a pre- and postnatal toxicity study when esomeprazole magnesium was administered at oral doses of 14 to 280 mg/kg/day (about 3.4 to 57 times an oral human dose of 40 mg on a body surface area basis). When rats were dosed from gestational day 7 through weaning on postnatal day 21, a statistically significant decrease in maternal femur weight of up to 14% (as compared to placebo treatment) was observed at doses equal to or greater than 138 mg/kg/day (about 33.6 times an oral human dose of 40 mg on a body surface area basis).\n- A pre- and postnatal development study in rats with esomeprazole strontium (using equimolar doses compared to esomeprazole magnesium study) produced similar results in dams and pups as described above.\nPregnancy Category (AUS):\nThere is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Esomeprazole sodium in women who are pregnant.\n\n【31】 ### Labor and Delivery\nThere is no FDA guidance on use of Esomeprazole sodium during labor and delivery.\n\n【32】 ### Nursing Mothers\n- Esomeprazole is likely present in human milk. Esomeprazole is the S-isomer of omeprazole and limited data indicate that maternal doses of omeprazole 20 mg daily produce low levels in human milk. Caution should be exercised when esomeprazole sodium is administered to a nursing woman.\n\n【33】 ### Pediatric Use\n- The safety and effectiveness of esomeprazole sodium for Injection have been established in pediatric patients 1 month to 17 years of age for short-term treatment of GERD with erosive esophagitis. However, effectiveness has not been established in patients less than 1 month of age.\n\n【34】 ### 1 month to 17 years of age\n- Use of esomeprazole sodium for Injection in pediatric patients 1 month to 17 years of age for short-term treatment of GERD with Erosive Esophagitis is supported by: a results observed from a pharmacokinetic (PK) study on esomeprazole sodium for Injection performed in pediatric patients, b predictions from a population PK model comparing I.V. PK data between adult and pediatric patients, and c relationship between exposure and pharmacodynamic results obtained from adult I.V. and pediatric oral data and d PK results already included in the current approved labeling and from adequate and well-controlled studies that supported the approval of esomeprazole sodium for Injection for adults.\n\n【35】 ### Neonates 0 to 1 month of age\n- Following administration of esomeprazole sodium in neonates the geometric mean (range) for CL was 0.17 L/h/kg (0.04 L/h/kg- 0.32 L/h/kg).\n- The safety and effectiveness of esomeprazole sodium in neonates have not been established.\n\n【36】 ### Geriatic Use\n- Of the total number of patients who received oral NEXIUM in clinical trials, 1,459 were 65 to 74 years of age and 354 patients were ≥ 75 years of age.\n- No overall differences in safety and efficacy were observed between the elderly and younger individuals, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.\n\n【37】 ### Gender\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Esomeprazole sodium with respect to specific gender populations.\n\n【38】 ### Race\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Esomeprazole sodium with respect to specific racial populations.\n\n【39】 ### Renal Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Esomeprazole sodium in patients with renal impairment.\n\n【40】 ### Hepatic Impairment\n- For adult patients with GERD, no dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic insufficiency (Child Pugh Classes A and B). For patients with severe hepatic insufficiency (Child Pugh Class C) a dose of 20 mg once daily should not be exceeded .\n\n【41】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Esomeprazole sodium in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n\n【42】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\nThere is no FDA guidance one the use of Esomeprazole sodium in patients who are immunocompromised.\n\n【43】 ### Administration\n- Intravenous\n\n【44】 ## General Information\n- The reconstituted solution of esomeprazole sodium should be stored at room temperature up to 30°C (86°F) and administered within 12 hours after reconstitution. (Administer within 6 hours if 5% Dextrose Injection is used after reconstitution). No refrigeration is required\n- Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) with Erosive Esophagitis - Preparation Instructions for Adult Patients\n- Intravenous Injection (20 mg or 40 mg vial) over no less than 3 minutes\n- The freeze-dried powder should be reconstituted with 5 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP.\n- Withdraw 5 mL of the reconstituted solution and administer as an intravenous injection over no less than 3 minutes.\n- A solution for intravenous infusion is prepared by first reconstituting the contents of one vial- with 5 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, Lactated Ringer’s Injection, USP or 5% Dextrose Injection, USP and further diluting the resulting solution to a final volume of 50 mL. The resultant concentration after diluting to a final volume of 50 mL is 0.8 mg/mL (for 40 mg vial) and 0.4 mg/mL (for 20 mg vial). The solution (admixture) should be administered as an intravenous infusion over a period of 10 minutes to 30 minutes.\n- For patients 1 month to less than 1 year of age, first calculate the dose (0.5 mg/kg) to determine the vial size needed.\n- Risk Reduction of Rebleeding of Gastric or Duodenal Ulcers in Adults\n- The continuous infusion is prepared by using two 40 mg vials. Reconstitute each 40 mg vial with 5 mL each of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP. The contents of the two vials should be further diluted in 100 mL 0.9%\n- Sodium Chloride Injection, USP for intravenous use. Administer at a rate of 8 mg/hour for 71.5 hours.\n\n【45】 #IV Compatibility\nThere is limited information about the IV Compatibility.\n\n【46】 #Overdosage\n- The minimum lethal dose of esomeprazole sodium in rats after bolus administration was 310 mg/kg (about 62 times the human dose on a body surface area basis). The major signs of acute toxicity were reduced motor activity, changes in respiratory frequency, tremor, ataxia and intermittent clonic convulsions.\n- Reports of overdosage with omeprazole in humans may also be relevant. Doses ranged up to 2,400 mg (120 times the usual recommended clinical dose). Manifestations were variable, but included confusion, drowsiness, blurred vision, tachycardia, nausea, diaphoresis, flushing, headache, dry mouth, and other adverse reactions similar to those seen in normal clinical experience. No specific antidote for esomeprazole is known. Since esomeprazole is extensively protein bound, it is not expected to be removed by dialysis. In the event of overdosage, treatment should be symptomatic and supportive.\n- As with the management of any overdose, the possibility of multiple drug ingestion should be considered. For current information on treatment of any drug overdose, a certified Regional Poison Control Center should be contacted\n\n【47】 ## Mechanism of Action\n- Esomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+- ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. The S- and R-isomers of omeprazole are protonated and converted in the acidic compartment of the parietal cell forming the active inhibitor, the achiral sulphenamide. By acting specifically on the proton pump, esomeprazole blocks the final step in acid production, thus reducing gastric acidity. This effect is dose-related up to a daily dose of 20 to 40 mg and leads to inhibition of gastric acid secretion.\n\n【48】 ## Structure\n- The active ingredient in NEXIUM I.V. (esomeprazole sodium) for Injection is (S)-5-methoxy-2sulfinyl-1 H-benzimidazole sodium, a proton pump inhibitor that inhibits gastric acid secretion. Esomeprazole is the S-isomer of omeprazole, which is a mixture of the S- and R- isomers. Its empirical formula is C17H18N3O3SNa with molecular weight of 367.4 g/mol (sodium salt) and 345.4 g/mol (parent compound). Esomeprazole sodium is very soluble in water and freely soluble in ethanol (95%). The structural formula is:\n- Esomeprazole sodium for Injection is supplied as a sterile, freeze-dried, white to off-white, porous cake or powder in a 5 mL vial, intended for intravenous administration after reconstitution with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP; Lactated Ringer’s Injection, USP or 5% Dextrose Injection, USP. esomeprazole sodium for Injection contains esomeprazole sodium 21.3 mg or 42.5 mg equivalent to esomeprazole 20 mg or 40 mg, edetate disodium 1.5 mg and sodium hydroxide q.s. for pH adjustment. The pH of reconstituted solution of esomeprazole sodium for Injection depends on the reconstitution volume and is in the pH range of 9 to 11. The stability of esomeprazole sodium in aqueous solution is strongly pH dependent. The rate of degradation increases with decreasing pH.\n\n【49】 ## Pharmacodynamics\nAntisecretory Activity\n- The effect of intravenous esomeprazole on intragastric pH was determined in two separate studies. In the first study, 20 mg of esomeprazole sodium for Injection was administered intravenously once daily at constant rate over 30 minutes for 5 days.\nGastric pH was measured over a 24-hour period\n- In a study in H. pylori negative healthy Caucasian volunteers (n=24), the % time over 24 hours (95 % CI) when intragastric pH was > 6 and > 7 was 52.3 % (40.3 – 64.4) and 4.8 % (1.8 – 7.8), respectively during administration of esomeprazole as an intravenous infusion of 80 mg over 30 minutes followed by a continuous infusion of 8 mg/h for 23.5 hours.\nSerum Gastrin Effects\n- In oral studies, the effect of NEXIUM on serum gastrin concentrations was evaluated in approximately 2,700 patients in clinical trials up to 8 weeks and in over 1,300 patients for up to 6-12 months. The mean fasting gastrin level increased in a dose-related manner. This increase reached a plateau within two to three months of therapy and returned to baseline levels within four weeks after discontinuation of therapy.\nEnterochromaffin-like (ECL) Cell Effects\n- There are no data available on the effects of intravenous esomeprazole on ECL cells.\n- In 24-month carcinogenicity studies of oral omeprazole in rats, a dose-related significant occurrence of gastric ECL cell carcinoid tumors and ECL cell hyperplasia was observed in both male and female animals.\n- Carcinoid tumors have also been observed in rats subjected to fundectomy or long-term treatment with other proton pump inhibitors or high doses of H2-receptor antagonists.\n- Human gastric biopsy specimens have been obtained from more than 3,000 patients (both children and adults) treated orally with omeprazole in long-term clinical trials. The incidence of ECL cell hyperplasia in these studies increased with time; however, no case of ECL cell carcinoids, dysplasia, or neoplasia has been found in these patients.\nEndocrine Effects\n- NEXIUM had no effect on thyroid function when given in oral doses of 20 or 40 mg for 4 weeks. Other effects of NEXIUM on the endocrine system were assessed using omeprazole studies. Omeprazole given in oral doses of 30 or 40 mg for 2 to 4 weeks had no effect on carbohydrate metabolism, circulating levels of parathyroid hormone, cortisol, estradiol, testosterone, prolactin, cholecystokinin or secretin.\n\n【50】 ## Pharmacokinetics\nAbsorption\n- The pharmacokinetic profile of esomeprazole sodium for Injection 20 mg and 40 mg was determined in 24 healthy volunteers for the 20 mg dose and 38 healthy volunteers for the 40 mg dose following once daily administration of 20 mg and 40 mg of esomeprazole sodium for Injection by constant rate over 30 minutes for five days.\nValues represent the geometric mean (95% CI)\n- During administration of esomeprazole over 24 hours as an intravenous infusion of 80 mg over 30 minutes followed by a continuous infusion of 8 mg/h for 23.5 hours (for a total of 24 hours) in healthy volunteers (n=24), esomeprazole PK parameters  were as follows: AUCt 111.1 µmol*h/L (100.5-122.7 µmol*h/L), Cmax 15.0 µmol/L (13.5-16.6 µmol/L), and steady state plasma concentration (Css) 3.9 µmol/L (3.5-4.5 µmol/L ).\n- In a Caucasian healthy volunteer study evaluating esomeprazole 80 mg over 30 minutes, followed by 8 mg/h over 23.5 h, systemic esomeprazole exposures were modestly higher (~ 17%) in the CYP2C19 intermediate metabolizers (IM; n=6 ) compared to extensive metabolizers (EM; n=17) of CYP2C19. Similar PK differences were noted across these genotypes in a Chinese healthy volunteer study that included 7 EMs and 11 IMs. There is very limited PK information for poor metabolizers (PM) from these studies.\nDistribution\n- Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2- 20 μmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.\nMetabolism\n- Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack antisecretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole’s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite. CYP2C19 isoenzyme exhibits polymorphism in the metabolism of esomeprazole, since some 3% of Caucasians and 15-20% of Asians lack CYP2C19 and are termed Poor Metabolizers. At steady state, the ratio of AUC in  Poor Metabolizers to AUC in the rest of the population (Extensive metabolizers) is approximately 2.\n- Following administration of equimolar doses, the S- and R-isomers are metabolize differently by the liver, resulting in higher plasma levels of the S- than of the R-isomer.\nExcretion\nConcomitant Use with Clopidogrel\n- Results from a crossover study in healthy subjects have shown a pharmacokinetic interaction between clopidogrel (300 mg loading dose/75 mg daily maintenance dose) and esomeprazole (40 mg p.o. once daily) when co-administered for 30 days. Exposure to the active metabolite of clopidogrel was reduced by 35% to 40% over this time period. Pharmacodynamic parameters were also measured and demonstrated that the change in inhibition of platelet aggregation was related to the change in the exposure to clopidogrel active metabolite.\nSpecific Populations\nGeriatric\n- In oral studies, the AUC and Cmax values were slightly higher (25% and 18%, respectively) in the elderly as compared to younger subjects at steady state. Dosage adjustment based on age is not necessary.\n- In a randomized, open-label, multi-national, repeated dose study, esomeprazole PK was evaluated following a once-daily 3-minute injection in a total of 50 pediatric patients 0 to 17 years old, inclusive. Esomeprazole plasma AUC values for 20 mg NEXIUM IV were 183% and 60% higher in pediatric patients aged 6 – 11 years and 12 –17 years respectively compared to adults given 20 mg. Subsequent pharmacokinetic analyses predicted that a dosage regimen of 0.5 mg/kg once-daily for pediatric patients 1-11 months of age, 10 mg for pediatric patients 1-17 years with body weight 55 kg would achieve comparable steady-state plasma exposures (AUC0-24) to those observed in adult patients administered 20 mg of esomeprazole sodium once every 24 hours. Further, increasing the infusion duration from 3 minutes to 10 minutes or 30 minutes was predicted to produce steady-state Cmax values that were comparable to those observed in adult patients at the 40 mg and 20 mg esomeprazole sodium doses.\nGender\nHepatic Impairment\n- However, in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency (Child Pugh Class C) a maximum dose of 20 mg once daily should not be exceeded.\n- There are no pharmacokinetic data available for esomeprazole administered as continuous intravenous administration in patients with liver impairment. The pharmacokinetics of omeprazole 80 mg over 30 minutes, followed by 8 mg/h over 47.5 hours in patients with mild (Child Pugh Class A; n=5), moderate (Child Pugh Class B; n=4) and severe (Child Pugh Class C; n=3) liver impairment were compared to those obtained in 24 male and female healthy volunteers. In patients with mild and moderate liver impairment, omeprazole clearance and steady state plasma concentration was approximately 35% lower and 50% higher, respectively, than in healthy volunteers. In patients with severe liver impairment, the omeprazole clearance was 50% of that in healthy volunteers and the steady state plasma concentration was double that in healthy volunteers.\n- For adult patients with bleeding gastric or duodenal ulcers and liver impairment, no dosage adjustment of the initial esomeprazole 80 mg infusion is necessary. For adult patients with mild to moderate liver impairment (Child Pugh Classes A and B), a maximum continuous infusion of esomeprazole 6 mg/h should not be exceeded. For adult patients with severe liver impairment (Child Pugh Class C), a maximum continuous infusion of 4 mg/h should not be exceeded.\nRenal Impairment\n- The pharmacokinetics of esomeprazole in patients with renal impairment are not expected to be altered relative to healthy volunteers as less than 1% of esomeprazole is excreted unchanged in urine.\n\n【51】 ### Effects on Gastrointestinal Microbial Ecology\n- Decreased gastric acidity due to any means including proton pump inhibitors, increases gastric counts of bacteria normally present in the gastrointestinal tract. Treatment with proton pump inhibitors may lead to slightly increased risk of gastrointestinal infections such as Salmonella and Campylobacter and, in hospitalized patients, possibly also Clostridium difficile.\n\n【52】 ### Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\n- The carcinogenic potential of esomeprazole was assessed using omeprazole studies. In two 24-month oral carcinogenicity studies in rats, omeprazole at daily doses of 1.7, 3.4, 13.8, 44.0, and 140.8 mg/kg/day (about 0.35 to 28 times the human dose of 40 mg/day expressed on a body surface area basis) produced gastric ECL cell carcinoids in a dose-related manner in both male and female rats; the incidence of this effect was markedly higher in female rats, which had higher blood levels of omeprazole. Gastric carcinoids seldom occur in the untreated rat. In addition, ECL cell hyperplasia was present in all treated groups of both sexes. In one of these studies, female rats were treated with 13.8 mg omeprazole/kg/day (about 2.8 times the human dose of 40 mg/day on a body surface area basis) for 1 year, then followed for an additional year without the drug. No carcinoids were seen in these rats. An increased incidence of treatment-related ECL cell hyperplasia was observed at the end of 1 year (94% treated vs 10% controls). By the second year the difference between treated and control rats was much smaller (46% vs 26%) but still showed more hyperplasia in the treated group. Gastric adenocarcinoma was seen in one rat (2%). No similar tumor was seen in male or female rats treated for 2 years. For this strain of rat no similar tumor has been noted historically, but a finding involving only one tumor is difficult to interpret. A 78-week oral mouse carcinogenicity study of omeprazole did not show increased tumor occurrence, but the study was not conclusive.\n- Esomeprazole was negative in the Ames mutation test, in the in vivo rat bone marrow cell chromosome aberration test, and the in vivo mouse micronucleus test.\n- The potential effects of esomeprazole on fertility and reproductive performance were assessed using omeprazole studies. Omeprazole at oral doses up to 138 mg/kg/day in rats (about 28 times the human dose of 40 mg/day on a body surface area basis) was found to have no effect on reproductive performance of parental animals.\n\n【53】 ### Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology\n- Reproduction studies have been performed in rats at oral doses up to 280 mg/kg/day (about 57 times an oral human dose of 40 mg on a body surface area basis) and in rabbits at oral doses up to 86 mg/kg/day (about 35 times an oral human dose of 40 mg on a body surface area basis) and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to esomeprazole.\n- A 28-day toxicity study with a 14-day recovery phase was conducted in juvenile rats with esomeprazole magnesium at doses of 70 to 280 mg/kg/day (about 17 to 57 times a daily oral human dose of 40 mg on a body surface area basis). An increase in the number of deaths at the high dose of 280 mg/kg/day was observed when juvenile rats were administered esomeprazole magnesium from postnatal day 7 through postnatal day 35. In addition, doses equal to or greater than 140 mg/kg/day (about 34 times a daily oral human dose of 40 mg on a body surface area basis), produced treatment-related decreases in body weight (approximately 14%) and body weight gain, decreases in femur weight and femur length, and affected overall growth. Comparable findings described above have also been observed in this study with another esomeprazole salt, esomeprazole strontium, at equimolar doses of esomeprazole.\n\n【54】 #Clinical Studies\nThere is limited information regarding Esomeprazole sodium Clinical Studies in the drug label.\n\n【55】 #How Supplied\n- Esomeprazole sodium for Injection is supplied as a freeze-dried powder containing 20 mg or 40 mg of esomeprazole per single-use vial.\n\n【56】 ## Storage\n- Store at 25°C (77°F); excursions permitted to 15°-30°C (59°- 86°F).

This debris obstructs the flow of filtrate, which results in reduced output of urine. The arterial supply of the nephron is linked to the filtration apparatus (glomerulus), and reduced perfusion leads to reduced blood flow; usually this is the result of pre-renal pathology.\nThe kidney's resorptive mechanisms are particularly energetic, using nearly 100% of the O2 supplied. Thus, the kidney is particularly sensitive to reduction in blood supply.\nThis phenomenon occurs because renal flow is restored prior to the normal resorption function of the renal tubule. As you can see in the graph, urine flow recovers rapidly and subsequently overshoots the typical daily output (between 800 mL and 2L in most people). Since the kidney's resorption capacity takes longer to re-establish, there is a minor lag in function that follows recovery of flow.\n07 - 0.12 mmol/L.\n\n【5】 - The  gene/Mutation in  has been associated with the development of , involving the  pathway.\n\n【6】 #Differentiating  from other Diseases\n-  must be differentiated from other diseases that cause , and , such as:\n\n【7】 #Epidemiology and Demographics\n- The prevalence of  is approximately  per 100,000 individuals worldwide.\n- In , the incidence of  was estimated to be  cases per 100,000 individuals in .\n\n【8】 ## Age\n- Patients of all age groups may develop .\n-  is more commonly observed among patients aged  years old.\n\n【9】 ## Gender\n-  affects men and women equally.\n- The  to  ratio is approximately  to 1.\n\n【10】 ## Race\n\n【11】 -  usually affects individuals of the  race.\n-  individuals are less likely to develop .\n\n【12】 #Risk Factors\n\n【13】 - Prognosis is generally , and the  of patients with  is approximately .\n\n【14】 ## Symptoms\n-  is usually asymptomatic.\n- Symptoms of  may include the following:\n\n【15】 ## Physical Examination\n- Patients with  usually appear .\n- Physical examination may be remarkable for:\n\n【16】 ## Laboratory Findings\n\n【17】 ## Imaging Findings\n\n【18】 ## Other Diagnostic Studies\n-  may also be diagnosed using .\n\n【19】 ## Medical Therapy\n- There is no treatment for ; the mainstay of therapy is supportive care.\n\n【20】 - Response to  can be monitored with  every .\n\n【21】 ## Surgery\n\n【22】 ## Prevention\n\n【23】 - Once diagnosed and successfully treated, patients with  are followed-up every .", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

It is variable in its structure as there are many polymorphisms of the gene which can lead to variable numbers of glutamine residues present in the protein. In its wild-type (normal) form, it contains 6-35 glutamine residues, however, in individuals affected by Huntington's Disease (an autosomal dominant genetic disorder), it contains between 36-155 glutamine residues. Huntingtin has a predicted mass of ~350kDa, however, this varies and is largely dependent on the number of glutamine residues in the protein. Normal huntingtin is generally accepted to be 3144 amino acids in size.\n\n【1】 #Function\nThe function of Huntingtin is unclear. It is essential for development and absence of huntingtin is lethal in mice. The protein has no sequence homology with other proteins and is highly expressed in neurons and testes in humans and rodents. It has however been experimentally demonstrated that Huntingtin acts as a transcription factor in upregulating the expression of Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF). In the deficient protein, there is suppression of this transcription regulatory function of Huntingtin and hence underexpression of BDNF.From immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, subcellular fractionation studies of the molecule, it has been found that Huntingtin is primarily associated with vesicles and microtubulesThese appear to indicate a functional role in cytoskeletal anchoring or transport of mitochondria.

{"seq_id": "6217e26d-7351-4969-9b5d-7242933d1e90", "title": null, "text": "【0】 Necrotizing fasciitis overview\n\n【1】 #Overview\nNecrotizing fasciitis or fasciitis necroticans, commonly known as “flesh-eating bacteria,” is a rare infection of the deeper layers of skin and subcutaneous tissues, easily spreading across the fascial plane within the subcutaneous tissue. Many types of bacteria can cause necrotizing fasciitis (eg. Group A streptococcus, Vibrio vulnificus, Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides fragilis), of which Group A streptococcus (also known as Streptococcus pyogenes) is the most common cause. It is severe inflammation of the muscle sheath that leads to necrosis of subcutaneous tissue and adjacent fascia.\n\n【2】 #Historical Perspective\nNarcotizing fasciitis was first described by Hippocrates in the fifth century B.C. as the complication of erysipelas. During the Civil War, necrotizing fasciitis was described as \"hospital gangrene\" by Confederate Army surgeon Joseph Jones. In 1924, Frank L. Meleney reported a series of 20 patients as having hemolytic streptococcal gangrene, later called Meleney's gangrene. Necrotizing fasciitis of perineum was described in 1883 by the French physician Jean Alfred Fournier.\n\n【3】 #Classification\nNecrotizing fasciitis may be classified according to International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10) into M72.6 Necrotizing fasciitis. Based on microbiological findings, necrotizing fasciitis may be classified into four types: Type I, Type II, Type III, and Type IV. Necrotizing fasciitis is further classified based on anatomic location and severity of symptoms.\n\n【4】 #Pathophysiology\nThe pathophysiology of necrotizing fasciitis is common to all types, but the speed of development and associated clinical features differs depending on the causative organisms. Following transmission, the bacteria uses the entry site to invade the fascial planes which causes the wide spread necrosis of superficial fascia, deep fascia, subcutaneous fat, nerves, arteries, and veins Inflammatory changes are seen on microscopic histopathology.\n\n【5】 #Causes\nThe causative organisms vary depending on the type of necrotizing fasciitis: Type I (polymicrobial), Type II (monomicrobial), Type III (Gram negative monomicrobial, including marine related organisms) and Type IV (fungal).\n\n【6】 #Differentiating Necrotizing Fasciitis from Other Diseases\nNecrotizing fasciitis must be differentiated from other diseases that cause erythema, pain, edema and necrosis of soft tissues such as sunburn, cellulitis, erysipelas, diabetic myonecrosis and vasculitis.\n\n【7】 #Epidemiology and Demographics\nThe incidence of necrotizing fasciitis in adults is 0.40 cases per 100,000 people/year and the incidence in children is higher at 0.08 cases per 100,000 people/year.The overall mortality rate in the United states from 2003- 2013 was 4.8/1,000,000 per year. Patients from all age groups can develop necrotizing fasciitis but slightly more common among >50 years age and effects men and women equally.The incidence rate of necrotizing fasciitis is high in black, Hispanic, and American Indian individuals compared to Whites and low in Asian individuals.\n\n【8】 #Risk Factors\nCommon risk factors in the development of necrotizing fasciitis include trauma, alcoholism, diabetes, intravenous drug abuse, immunosupression and burns.\n\n【9】 #Screening\nAccording to the U.S. Preventive Service Task Force (USPSTF), there is insufficient evidence to recommend routine screening for necrotizing fasciitis.\n\n【10】 #Natural History, Complications, and Prognosis\nIf left untreated, the acute inflammatory changes spread quickly, accompanied by high fever and extreme weakness leading to necrosis of soft tissue. Common complications of necrotizing fasciitis include limb loss, sepsis, toxic shock syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Depending on the extent of the necrotizing fasciitis at the time of diagnosis, the prognosis may vary. The prognostic factors associated with necrotizing fasciitis include diabetes mellitus, acute renal failure, admission serum creatinine >2mg/dl and admission white blood cells >30,000 cells mm3.\n\n【11】 ## Diagnostic Criteria\nLRINEC is a diagnostic scoring system used to distinguish necrotizing fasciitis from other soft tissue infections.\n\n【12】 ## History and Symptoms\nDuring early stages, the symptoms of necrotizing fasciitis are non-specific. Symptoms include fever, nausea, and fatigue.\n\n【13】 ## Physical Examination\nPhysical examination of patients with necrotizing fasciitis is usually remarkable for local soft tissue signs such as warmth, tenderness beyond margins of erythema, swelling, erythema with ill defined margins, blistering/bullae, skin discoloration, foul discharge (greyish or brown discharge), fluctuance, crepitus, skin sloughing or necrosis, absence of lymphangitis or lymphadenopathy (lymphangitis is rarely observed in necrotizing fasciitis patients), sensory and motor deficits (e.g. localized anesthesia). Finger probe test is useful in the diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis.\n\n【14】 ## Laboratory Findings\nLaboratory findings consistent with the diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis include positive blood and tissue culture, elevated inflammatory markers, leukocytosis and elevated serum creatinine.\n\n【15】 ### Electrocardiogram\nThere are no electrocardiogram findings associated with necrotizing fasciitis. Electrocardiogram may be helpful in the diagnosis and management of complications of necrotizing fasciitis.\n\n【16】 ### X Ray\nOn x ray of affected area, necrotizing fasciitis is characterized by subcutaneous gas or soft tissue swelling (specific x-ray finding) and increased soft tissue thickness and opacity. Chest x-ray findings associated with necrotizing fasciitis include early changes of fluid overload and adult (acute) respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\n\n【17】 ### CT\nOn CT scan, necrotizing fasciitis is characterized by subcutaneous emphysema, asymmetrical fascial thickening associated with fat stranding, edema and abscesses.\n\n【18】 ### MRI\nOn MRI, necrotizing fasciitis is characterized by features such as loss of muscle texture and high signal intensity compatible with intramuscular hemorrhage in T1 weighted image. On T2-weighted images, subcutaneous and intramuscular edema in a reticulated pattern and subfascial and interfascial crescentic fluid collection are seen.\n\n【19】 ### Ultrasound\nUltrasound is more useful in children (with raising incidence after primary varicella infection). On ultrasound, necrotizing fasciitis is characterized by distorted and thickened fascial planes with turbid fluid accumulation in the fascial layers, subcutaneous edema and soft tissue gas.\n\n【20】 ## Biopsy\n\n【21】 ## Medical Therapy\nNecrotizing fasciitis is a medical and surgical emergency. The mainstay of therapy for necrotizing fasciitis includes surgical exploration and debridement along with antimicrobial therapy. Initial pharmacologic therapy often includes a combination of intravenous antibiotics including penicillin, vancomycin, and/or clindamycin.\n\n【22】 ## Surgery\nSurgery is the mainstay of treatment for necrotizing fasciitis. Immediate surgical referral remains the only method of reducing mortality and morbidity.\n\n【23】 ## Primary Prevention\nEffective measures for the primary prevention of necrotizing fasciitis include prevention of trauma/breaks in skin integrity, treatment of underlying infections, hand washing, proper wound care and proper management of underlying co-morbidities.\n\n【24】 ## Secondary Prevention\nSecondary prevention strategies following necrotizing fasciitis include early diagnosis and prompt treatment with either antibiotics or surgery. This strategy prevents or slows the progression and complications of the disease.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

About 1 percent of the U.S. population has hyperthyroidism. Some diseases, such as Graves’ disease, thyroid nodules and thyroiditis, are associated with the cause of hyperthyroidism. Hyperthyroidism can affect your metabolism. Usual signs and symptoms include goiter, increased appetite but weight loss, palpitation, hypertension, increased sensitivity to heat and perspiration, nervousness and hand tremors. The Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH) test is a very sensitive and useful test to identify the disorder. Other examinations include the T3 and T4 test, radioactive iodine uptake test and thyroid scan. Treatment options of hyperthyroidism depends on the cause, age, physical condition and the severity of symptoms. Usual treatment measures are medications, radioactive iodine and thyroidectomy. The common side effect of radioactive iodine and thyroidectomy is hypothyroidism. The patient will need to take thyroid hormone supplement to restore normal hormone levels.\n\n【2】 ## What are the symptoms of Hyperthyroidism?\nSymptoms of hyperthyroidism vary from person to person. Usual signs include the following:\n- Goiter\n- Increased appetite, but weight loss\n- Palpitation\n- Hypertension\n- Nervousness, anxiety or irritability, difficulty sleeping\n- Hand tremors\n- Fatigue, muscle weakness\n- Changes in menstrual patterns (usually lighter flow, less frequent periods) in women\nOther health problems may also cause these symptoms. Only a doctor can tell for sure. A person with any of these symptoms should tell the doctor so that the problems can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible.\n\n【3】 ## Who is at highest risk?\n- Graves’ disease\n- Thyroid nodules\n- Too much iodine ingestion\n- Over-medicating with synthetic thyroid hormone\n\n【4】 ## Diagnosis - Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH) test: This is a very sensitive and useful test and usually used as the first test to identify the disorder. The TSH test is based on the feedback between TSH and thyroid hormone. Patients with hyperthyroidism may show a lower reading than normal people.\n- T3 and T4 test: This test may show the levels of T3 and T4 in your blood. In patients with hyperthyroidism, the levels of one or both of these hormones in your blood will be higher than normal.\n- Thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI) test: This test may help diagnose Graves' disease, which has this kind of antibody.\n- Radioactive iodine uptake test: This test can detect the iodine uptake function of your thyroid gland and help diagnose the cause of hyperthyroidism. For example, low levels of iodine uptake might be a sign of thyroiditis, whereas high levels could indicate Graves’ disease.\nOther diseases with similar symptoms:\n- Autonomic nerve dysfunction\n- Coronary artery disease\n- Goiter\n- Schizophrenia - Thyroid cancer\n\n【5】 ## When to seek urgent medical care?\nCall your health care provider if symptoms of hyperthyroidism develop. If you experience either of the following symptoms, seeking urgent medical care as soon as possible:\n- Palpitation\n- Severe hypertension\n\n【6】 ## Treatment options\nUsual treatment measures of hyperthyroidism include medications, radioactive iodine, and surgery. Treatment options depends on the cause, age, physical condition and the severity of symptoms.\n- Medications: Antithyroid medications, such as methimazole (Tapazole) and propylthiouracil (PTU), are used to block the production of thyroid hormone. Symptoms may begin to improve in 6 to 12 weeks and the whole treatment period may last for at least a year. Beta blockers, for example propranolol, may be used to relieve symptoms such as palpitation, nervousness,hypertension, sweating and shaking.\n- Radioactive iodine: This kind of treatment may destroy the thyroid gland and stop the excess production of hormones. During this period, the patient takes radioactive iodine by mouth. A common side effect is permanent hypothyroidism, which needs thyroid supplements.\n- Surgery: Thyroidectomy is another type of treatment option. The possible side effect after surgery is hypothyroidism. Patients need to take thyroid hormone supplements to restore normal hormone levels.\n\n【7】 ## Contraindicated medications\nPatients diagnosed with hyperthyroidism should avoid using the following medications:\n- Levothyroxine\n- PhentermineIf you have been diagnosed with hyperthyroidism, consult your physician before starting or stopping any of these medications.\n\n【8】 ## Where to find medical care for Hyperthyroidism?\nDirections to Hospitals Treating Hyperthyroidism\n\n【9】 ## Prevention\n- For hyperthyroidism caused by too much iodine ingestion, the method of prevention is decreasing iodine ingestion and a regular check of thyroid hormone levels in the blood.\n\n【10】 ## What to expect (Outlook/Prognosis)?\nMany cases of hyperthyroidism are generally treatable. Prognosis depends on whether or not the patient has severe complications.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

{"seq_id": "ab09112e-462f-4916-a980-927ceb9fe5a5", "title": null, "text": "【0】 cute aortic syndrome (AAS) is a life-threatening emergency, accounting for 1/2000 presentations of acute chest or back pain to the emergency department. 1 It is a clinical spectrum of diagnoses including aortic dissection, intramural hematoma and penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer at any location along the aorta. 1 The incidence of AAS is about 3 per 100 000 persons. 2,3 Many physicians do not consider AAS in their initial differential diagnosis, which is in part why 25% of patients with AAS are not diagnosed with the condition until 24 hours after presenting to the emergency department. 4 Prognosis is most favourable when patients are treated early, while they are clinically stable 17 Use of CT in a low-prevalence population can result in an increase in false-positives, which can lead to further testing, unnecessary transfer and even surgical intervention. 19 There are 2 high-quality guidelines related to the diagnosis of AAS, from the American Heart Association  and the European Society of Cardiology . 20,21 However, there is still considerable variation in how clinicians investigate for AAS in Canada. 17 This variation is likely multifactorial but may be a result of lack of key stakeholder involvement in the development of the guidelines or the difference in threshold for investigation within the Canadian health care system. 22,23 The aims of this guideline are to update the available guideline recommendations with current evidence; include key stakeholders to allow interpretation of the evidence in context of values and preferences; and make practice recommendations that are applicable to the Canadian health care system.\nThe purpose of this guideline is to provide evidence-based recommendations about the diagnostic evaluation of patients with suspected AAS. Our definition of AAS does not include ruptured or leaking aortic aneurysms. This guideline is not applicable to pregnant patients, patients with recent (< 24 hr) cocaine use or patients younger than 18 years. The primary studies used to generate the recommendations either did not include these patients or did not report on their inclusion; therefore, the diagnostic accuracy of signs and symptoms for AAS are unknown within these populations.\nWe present diagnostic pathways based on the expected prevalence of AAS and provide guidance on testing based on clinically relevant and accepted thresholds for diagnostic error. The recommendations are further guided by principles of minimizing radiation exposure and the required number of diagnostic tests to meet the accepted thresholds, where possible. This guideline is intended to aid clinicians in selecting optimal diagnostic test(s) that are more likely to result in a diagnostic result, reduce the number of diagnostic tests and minimize exposure to radiation.\nThe target audience includes patients, emergency medicine physicians, family physicians, internists, radiologists, vascular surgeons, cardiothoracic surgeons, critical care physicians and decision-makers.\n\n【1】 #Recommendations\nThe 4 recommendations in this guideline are divided into the following categories: assessment of pretest probability (risk factors, pain features, clinical suspicion and alternative diagnoses, and physical examination) and diagnostic strategy (low, medium and high pretest probability) .\nPretest probability is defined as the probability of a patient having the target disorder before a diagnostic test result is known\n\n【2】 #Assessment of pretest probability\n\n【3】 #Risk factors\nRisk factors for AAS include connective tissue disease, aortic valve disease, recent aortic manipulation, aortic aneurysm (thoracic or abdominal, on chest radiograph, history or bedside echocardiography) and family history of AAS.\nHowever, the International Registry of Acute Aortic Dissection database, a multicentre registry that includes more than 4000 cases, states that a known aortic aneurysm, either thoracic or abdominal, is associated with AAS. 24 Therefore, we updated the definition of aortic aneurysm in our assessment of pretest probability to include both abdominal and thoracic aneurysms as risk factors.\nPatients may not be aware of the presence of an aortic aneurysm. Bedside ultrasound has been found to be accurate in the diagnosis of abdominal aortic aneurysms. 25 A multicentre prospective observational study including 839 patients (very lowquality evidence, downgraded for risk of bias and indirectness) showed moderate diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity 0.60, 95% confidence interval  0.51-0.68; specificity 0.85, 95% CI 0.83-0.88) for assessment of aneurysmal dilation of the aortic root. 26 Bedside ultrasound is operator dependent; therefore, the diagnostic accuracy may vary depending on the level of training. However, it is reasonable to examine those who are presenting with symptoms suggestive of AAS for the presence of an abdominal or thoracic aortic aneurysm in the visible portions of the aorta.\nWe found 7 observational (prospective and retrospective) studies including 659 patients (very low-or low-quality evidence, downgraded for substantial heterogeneity and imprecision) that suggest chest radiograph may also be helpful (sensitivity 0.79, 95% CI 0.70-0.85; specificity 0.56, 95% CI 0.41-0.70) in suggesting a possible thoracic aortic dilation.  A systematic review of 9 studies (n = 551) found clinical examination is not sufficient in diagnosing rapid aortic expansion or a leaking, ruptured or dissecting aortic aneurysm. 33 Therefore, if a patient presents with pain and a known or newly diagnosed aortic aneurysm, they should undergo advanced imaging. This is a modification of the European Society of Cardiology and American Heart Association guidelines .\n\n【4】 #High-risk pain features\nHigh-risk pain features for AAS include abrupt-onset or thunderclap pain, severe or worst-ever pain, tearing or ripping pain, migrating or radiating pain.\nThe American Heart Association guideline recommends that high-risk pain be defined as pain that is either severe or abrupt in onset, with a tearing, ripping, sharp or stabbing characteristic. Rogers and colleagues modified this recommendation to define high-risk pain as any abrupt, severe, tearing or ripping pain This tool was the result of expert consensus and was incorporated into the European Society of Cardiology guideline.\nIn contrast, the committee agreed that a patient with severe pain versus a patient with severe, abrupt-onset, tearing pain were not at the same pretest probability for AAS. We also thought that an increasing number of high-risk pain features was associated with an increased pretest probability for AAS; however, this was based entirely on expert consensus as we found no direct evidence on systematic review of the literature.\n\n【5】 #Clinical suspicion or alternative diagnosis\n\n【6】 #Assessment of pretest probability\n\n【7】 Strong recommendation based on low certainty in the evidence of effects on clinical outcomes and moderate certainty in the evidence of diagnostic accuracy studies.\nThe committee suggests using historical pain, risk factors and physical examination findings to define a patient as low (≤ 0.5%), moderate (0.5%-5%) or high (> 5%) probability for AAS .\nTechnical remarks:\n- An absence of any high-risk historical, risk factor or physical examination findings places the patient in a population with a very low prevalence for AAS.\n- The panel recognized that different clinical features have different strengths of association with AAS.\n- Clinical suspicion for an alternative diagnosis or for AAS is important in assessment of pretest probability.\n- Patients with a low risk of AAS and no alternative diagnosis are still considered low risk.\n- The panel suggests the presence of any clinical features strongly associated with AAS (hypotension, pulse deficit, neurologic deficit, new murmur of aortic regurgitation, aortic aneurysm) places the patient in a higher probability population.\n\n【8】 #Low pretest probability\nThe committee suggests no further testing in a population with a low pretest probability (prevalence of AAS of ≤ 0.5%).\nConditional recommendation based on low certainty in the evidence of effects on clinical outcomes and moderate certainty in the evidence of diagnostic accuracy studies.\nTechnical remarks:\n- There are no prospectively validated clinical decision rules to assess pretest probability. Estimates are based on modelling of low-or moderatequality observational studies.\n\n【9】 #Intermediate pretest probability\nThe committee suggests using a strategy starting with D-dimer for excluding AAS in a population with an intermediate pretest probability (prevalence 0.5%-5%), followed by ECG-gated CT in patients with a positive D-dimer test. If D-dimer testing is not readily available, an alternative acceptable strategy includes performing ECG-gated CT alone.\nConditional recommendation for D-dimer based on low certainty in the evidence of effects on clinical outcomes and moderate certainty in the evidence about diagnostic accuracy studies. Conditional recommendation for ECG-gated CT aorta based on moderate certainty in the evidence of effects on clinical outcomes and moderate certainty in the evidence from diagnostic accuracy studies.\nThe committee suggests no further testing after a negative D-dimer test in a population with an intermediate pretest probability (prevalence 0.5%-5%).\nGrading as per low pretest probability recommendation.\nthe assessment of pretest probability. In contrast, committee members agreed that this happens concurrently with assessment of historical risk features and should be included in initial pretest probability assessment. Results from a national survey supported this view, with respondents rating likelihood of AAS or of an alternative diagnosis as extremely important in the assessment of pretest probability, ranking higher than any pain characteristic, risk factor or physical examination finding. 35 There is no formal assessment of the diagnostic accuracy of clinical suspicion for AAS The results of this meta-analysis (sensitivity 0.79, 95% CI 0.70-0.87; specificity 0.63, 95% CI 0.60-0.65) were incorporated into the summary estimate of diagnostic accuracy in Bayesian modelling . Incorporating clinical suspicion into pretest probability assessment allowed for an improvement in specificity while keeping the miss rate below an acceptable threshold. Care should be taken if the alternative diagnosis being considered is acute coronary syndrome, stroke or an unconfirmed pulmonary embolism. These are the most common initial diagnoses in patients with a missed AAS. 4,9,10,13,16 Physical examination High-risk physical examination findings for AAS include new aortic regurgitation (auscultated murmur or bedside echocardiography), pulse deficit, neurologic deficit, hypotension or pericardial effusion on bedside echocardiography.\n- A decision to start with D-dimer testing assumes the results will be obtained in a timely manner and that the cost of D-dimer screening is offset by avoiding unnecessary ECG-gated CT aorta or transfer of patients at moderate pretest probability for AAS. If the D-dimer strategy is followed, a highly sensitive D-dimer assay is required.\n- A negative D-dimer test (i.e. < 500 ng/mL) indicates a low probability (< 0.5%) of AAS and no additional testing is required.\n- The likelihood of a positive D-dimer test (> 500 ng/mL) increases with age; however, there are no studies reporting on the diagnostic accuracy of age-adjusted D-dimer testing for the diagnosis of AAS. Therefore, the standard threshold of > 500 ng/mL was used to indicate a positive test.\n- ECG-gated CT of the aorta is the next step after a positive D-dimer result. AAS is a time-sensitive condition and CT should be expedited. The preference is for an ECG-gated scan. A negative ECG-gated CT rules out AAS.\n\n【10】 #High pretest probability\nThe committee recommends using a strategy starting with ECG-gated CT for assessing patients suspected of having AAS in a population with a high pretest probability (prevalence ≥ 5%).\nStrong recommendation for ECG-gated CT aorta based on moderate certainty in the evidence of effects on clinical outcomes and moderate certainty in the evidence of diagnostic accuracy studies.\nConditional recommendation against D-dimer based on low certainty in the evidence of effects on clinical outcomes and moderate certainty in the evidence of diagnostic accuracy studies.\nTechnical remarks:\n- There are no prospectively validated clinical decision rules to assess for a pretest probability of > 5%. Estimates are based on modelling of lowor moderate-quality observational studies.\n- CT should be ECG gated to avoid motion artifacts especially of the aortic root and ascending aorta. It is important to scan with and without contrast to rule out an intramural hematoma. Reconstruction to thinner slices (< 1 mm) and multiplanar reconstruction including sagittal oblique for thoracic aorta are recommended.\n- If CT is not feasible (e.g. contrast media allergy, severe renal impairment, or unavailability), MRI or TEE may be acceptable.\n- In cases where clinical suspicion for AAS remains high with a negative initial CT, repeat ECG-gated CT should be considered. If repeat CT with proper technique is not feasible, additional testing with TEE or MRI may be considered.\nNote: AAS = acute aortic syndrome, CT = computed tomography, ECG = electrocardiogram, MRI = magnetic resonance imaging, TEE = transesophageal echocardiography.\nits independent association with AAS. Multiple studies analyzed it as a composite variable with pulse deficit or blood pressure differential In the context of other pain, risk factors and physical examination findings, it likely does not add any benefit in assessment of pretest probability. Therefore, we removed bilateral blood pressure differential from the high-risk physical examination findings .\nA single-centre study of 839 patients (very low-quality evidence, downgraded for risk of bias and indirectness) suggests that bedside ultrasound is capable of diagnosing aortic regurgitation in AAS (sensitivity 0.1, 95% CI 0.06-0.16; specificity 0.93, 95% CI 0.91-0.95). 26 Diagnostic accuracy of bedside ultrasound for aortic regurgitation may vary between providers. This variation is also seen with clinical examination. Auscultation has moderate-to-low inter-rater reliability and diagnostic accuracy. 42,43 Therefore, the committee agreed that point-of-care ultrasonographic evidence of new aortic regurgitation in a patient presenting with symptoms suggestive of AAS is a highrisk examination finding, in addition to auscultation of a murmur consistent with aortic regurgitation. The use of point-ofcare ultrasound is meant to augment physical examination; therefore, if a provider is not trained in its use, it is simply omitted from pretest probability assessment. The addition of pointof-care ultrasonography is an update to the American Heart Association guideline, but is present in the European Society of Cardiology guideline .\n\n【11】 #Low pretest probability\nThe committee suggests no further testing in a population with a low pretest probability (prevalence of AAS of ≤ 0.5%) (conditional recommendation based on low certainty in the evidence of effects on clinical outcomes and moderate certainty in the evidence of diagnostic accuracy studies).\n\n【12】 #High pretest probability\nThe committee recommends using a strategy starting with ECGgated CT for assessing patients suspected of having AAS in a population with a high pretest probability (prevalence ≥ 5%) (strong recommendation for ECG-gated CT based on moderate certainty in the evidence of effects on clinical outcomes and moderate certainty in the evidence of diagnostic accuracy studies).\n\n【13】 #D-dimer testing\nThe recommendations for D-dimer testing are based on a metaanalysis of 22 studies with 3860 patients . According to the QUADAS-2 (quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies) tool, 19/22 of the included studies had at least 1 domain rated as high risk of bias. The evidence was rated as very low for specificity (0.60, 95% CI 0.48-0.71) and moderate for sensitivity (0.95, 95% CI 0.90-0.99). There are 2 other meta-analyses that included only 5 of the 22 articles we included in the meta-analysis; their QUADAS assessments found a low or unclear risk of bias in most domains, leading to downgrading of the level of certainty. 44,45 ECG-gated CT of the aorta Acute aortic syndrome is a time-sensitive emergency and if a patient is deemed at high risk, an ECG-gated CT of the aorta  should be expedited. We found 1 meta-analysis with a total of 3 studies. Although a small number of patients (n = 126) were included, there were no serious limitations in indirectness, inconsistency, imprecision or risk of bias.\nWhenever available, ECG gating (prospective) should be used for imaging of suspected acute aortic syndrome, to avoid motion artifacts especially at the aortic root and ascending aorta. Scanning of the thoracic aorta without contrast is important to rule out intramural hematoma. Reconstruction to thinner slices (< 1 mm) and multiplanar reconstruction including sagittal oblique for thoracic aorta are suggested.\n\n【14】 #Methods\nWe chose to adapt existing high-quality clinical practice guidelines previously developed by the American Heart Association and European Society of Cardiology using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE)-ADOLOPMENT (combined use of adoption, adaptation, and de novo development of recommendations) approach. 20,21,46 The overall guideline development process -including funding of the work, formation of participating groups, management of competing interests, internal and external review, and organizational approval -was guided by the Guidelines International Network-McMaster Guideline Development Checklist. 25 We structured our process to meet the recommendations for trustworthy guidelines by the National Academy of Medicine and the Guidelines International Network\n\n【15】 #Composition of participating groups\nWe recruited 21 people from across Canada to take part in developing the guideline as members of the guideline advisory committee. The advisory committee included emergency phys icians and nurses, cardiothoracic and vascular surgeons, cardiac anesthesiologists, critical care physicians, radiologists and 2 patients. We selected members based on their expertise and professional and geographic diversity, as well as practice environment (academic, community, rural or remote). Methodologists with expertise in evidence appraisal and guideline development were also included (R.O. J.Y. K.Y. E.L.). From members of the advisory committee, we appointed a guideline chair (R.O.) and a guideline coordination panel (S.M. D.A. P.J.).\n\n【16】 #Formulating specific clinical questions and determining outcomes of interest\n\n【17】 We used these pathways to guide the evidence synthesis and recommendations 52 In brief, the coordination panel brainstormed all possible outcomes, then rated their relative importance for decision-making according to the GRADE approach. 53 The coordination panel rated the following outcomes as critical for decision-making across the AAS diagnosis questions: missed diagnosis, increase in CT use, increase in D-dimer use and unnecessary transfer, in addition to the diagnostic accuracy outcomes (i.e. false-positive, false-negative, true-positive and true-negative test results).\n\n【18】 #Evidence review\nTo support the guideline, systematic reviews were performed ,R.O. S.M. N.F.\nWe used the QUADAS-2 tool to assess risk of bias for included studies. 54 We evaluated the quality of the evidence that met inclusion criteria following the GRADE approach, based on the following domains: risk of bias, precision, consistency and magnitude of the estimate of effects, directness of the evidence and risk of publication bias. 55 We categorized the certainty of evidence into 4 levels, ranging from very low to high. 53,55,56 In the absence of any data, the level of evidence was rated as very low, because it was based on expert consensus.\nThere is very little published evidence on diagnostic pathways related to AAS; therefore, the coordination panel developed simple Bayesian models to calculate test accuracy of different pathways with a different combination of signs, symptoms and tests. The model included data obtained from the systematic reviews for AAS prevalence and the pooled diagnostic test accuracy for different tests. We used this method to present the test results explicitly, while considering different prevalence estimates, multiple potential diagnostic pathways and different assumptions about the performance of the tests in different populations. We summarized the predicted overall test strategy results from the model and the quality of evidence assessed using the GRADE approach in evidence tables, which allowed for a comparison of the benefits and harms of different diagnostic strategies.\n\n【19】 #Development of recommendations\n\n【20】 A 1-day in-person meeting for advisory committee members was held in Sudbury, Ontario, on Nov. 23, 2018. The meeting was used to discuss the proposed diagnostic pathways and evidenceto-decision frameworks and come to consensus with regard to the strength of recommendations.\nRecommendations were based on the balance of benefits and harms, the quality of evidence, and patient values and preferences, as per GRADE methodology. The initial draft recommendations were prepared by R.O Consensus was achieved through discussion. Initial plans were to use online software for anonymous voting using a modified Delphi process; however, the coordination panel and the advisory committee decided that they would prefer open discussion. Unanimous consensus was reached on all draft recommendations.\n\n【21】 #Clinical decision aid\nWe developed a clinical decision aid to compile the recommendations into a single tool . We combined the Bayesian models for each sign and symptom together with our identified values and preferences and defined thresholds for advanced im aging or no further testing. We used thresholds for investigation\n\n【22】 The strength of a recommendation is expressed as either strong (\"the guideline panel recommends .\"), or conditional (\"the guideline panel suggests …\") and is interpreted as shown below. 59\n\n【23】 #Strong recommendation\n- For patients: most individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action, and only a small proportion would not.\n- For clinicians: most individuals should receive the intervention or test. Formal decision aids are not likely to be needed to help individual patients make decisions consistent with their values and preferences.\n\n【24】 #Conditional recommendation\n- For patients: the majority of individuals in this situation may want the suggested course of action, but many may not. Decision aids may be useful in helping patients to make decisions consistent with their individual risks, values and preferences.\ninformed by a national survey of emergency physicians to define low , 5%, a value of 2. Further investigations (i.e. D-dimer testing, ECG-gated CT aorta) were then applied to the post-test probabilities to determine their utility.  the full guideline for the method used to generate the prevalence estimates and to define the test thresholds .\n\n【25】 #External review\nThe draft recommendations were distributed to more than 300 emergency medicine physicians, radiologists and surgeons for review in October 2019. The goal of the review was to obtain stakeholder feedback on the interpretation of the evidence, the strength of the recommendations and document layout.\nKey stakeholder organizations also reviewed the guideline and supporting documents: the Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians, the Canadian Society of Cardiac Surgery, the Canadian Society of Vascular Surgery and the Canadian Society of Thoracic Radiology.\n\n【26】 #Management of competing interests\nDevelopment of this guideline was wholly funded by the Alternate Funding Plan grant of the Northern Ontario Academic Medical Association, a nonprofit academic medical association. Members of the advisory committee received travel reimbursement for attendance at the in-person meeting. Members of the coordin ation panel received no other payments.\nWe managed competing interests of all participants according to recommendations of the Institute of Medicine and the Guidelines International Network. 48,50 Before appointment to the advisory committee, individuals disclosed both direct (financial) and indirect (nonfinancial) interests. Members of the coordination panel and chair reviewed the disclosures and judged which interests were conflicts and should be managed. At the time of appointment, the entire advisory committee had no direct competing interests, defined as no current material interest in any commercial entity with a product that could be affected by the guideline. After the guideline was completed, this process was repeated; no additional competing interests were reported.\n\n【27】 #Implementation\nAdaptation of these recommendations will likely be necessary in some circumstances; this document may serve as a basis for adaptation by local, regional or national guideline groups. For example, guideline implementation in an urban centre with 24-hour access to CT may differ from a rural or remote location that requires transfer of a patient with accompanying staff. These adaptations should be based on the associated evidenceto-decision frameworks. 46 Using a theory-driven, qualitative approach, we interviewed emergency medicine physicians from 4 urban and rural hospitals to describe current practice and to identify the barriers and facilitators to a standardized approach for investigating patients for AAS (Cait Dimitrew, Northern Ontario School of Medicine, Sudbury, Ontario; unpublished data 2020). Saturation of themes was achieved after 9 physician interviews.\nWe identified 3 barriers to implementation of this guideline: use of D-dimer and knowledge of rationale for its use in AAS is not widespread; the decision aid in the guideline was not in alignment with current practice or physician understanding of risk factors; and the complexity of the suggested decision aid in the guideline was a potential barrier to accurate application and desired outcomes.\n\n【28】 #Suggested performance measures\nBased on consensus of the advisory committee, we developed a suggested set of performance measures to accompany this guideline for consideration by providers and policy-makers: proportion of missed cases of AAS, time to diagnosis of AAS, emergency department disposition time, proportion of patients receiving a CT aorta, proportion of patients with D-dimer testing, and proportion of patients transferred for imaging or consultation.\n\n【29】 #Updates\nThe guideline coordination panel will be responsible for updating the guideline every 5 years.\n\n【30】 #Other guidelines\nAll 3 guidelines recommend further testing depending on assessment of pretest probability. However, the importance of specific clinical features and results of investigations may be interpreted differently. Additionally, the recommended testing by pretest probability varies among the guidelines. These differences are based on the interpretation of evidence and the thresholds for investigations in different practice environments.\n\n【31】 #Gaps in knowledge\nThe recommendations in this guideline are largely based on very low-or low-quality evidence and on modelled estimates for the popu lation prevalence of AAS. The evidence base would benefit from prospective data collection of important high-risk clinical variables in order to increase the quality of evidence. Prevalence and pretest probability are continuous variables but for modelling purposes, required input of a specific population prevalence. Prevalence estimates greatly different from those used in modelling will affect the recommendations. Future studies are needed to validate the diagnostic accuracy of this guideline's recommendations across a spectrum of disease prevalence in emergency departments.\n\n【32】 #Conclusion\nAcute aortic syndrome is a difficult-to-diagnose aortic emergency. We propose recommendations to aid clinicians in riskstratifying patients and, depending on risk level, suggest further investigations needed. This guideline is intended as a resource for practising clinicians, both as an evidence base and a guide to investigation for this high-risk aortic catastrophe.\nCompeting interests: Ashish Gupta reports receiving reimbursement of", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

EMT is essential for numerous developmental processes including mesoderm formation and neural tube formation.\nSeveral signal transduction pathways, such as Ras-MAPK and Wnt, have been shown to be involved in regulation of EMT. In particular, Ras-MAPK has been shown to activate two related transcription factors known as Snail and Slug. Both of these proteins are transcriptional repressors of E-cadherin and their expression induces EMT.\nTwist, another transcription factor, has also been shown to induce EMT, and is also implicated in the regulation of metastasis. Expression of FOXC2, an important player during embryonic development has been shown to induce EMT and regulate metastasis. Moreover, expression of FOXC2  is induced when epithelial cells undergo EMT by Snail, Twist, Goosecoid, and TGF-beta 1.\nInitiation of metastasis involves invasion, which has many phenotypic similarities to EMT, including a loss of cell-cell adhesion mediated by E-cadherin repression and an increase in cell mobility.\nEMT is a characteristic feature of cells undergoing proliferation.

Individuals may also engage in broader noncompliant behaviours if they acquire a fear of needles as a result of negative vaccination experiences. 3 There are many evidence-based treatments to mitigate pain at the time of vaccination; however, most are not routinely used. 4,5 An independent, cross-Canada multidisciplinary team, Help Eliminate Pain in Kids (HELPinKIDS), assembled in 2008 to tackle this gap in clinical care. In 2010, the HELPinKIDS team published the first clinical practice guideline on reducing pain during childhood vaccination. 6 There are currently no guidelines on reducing pain during vaccination in adults.\n\n【1】 and knowledge translation (KT group) aspects. The chair (A.T.) oversaw all aspects of the project.\nPractice recommendations were made for 49 clinical questions organized into five domains of pain management interventions (the \"5P\" approach): procedural, physical, pharmacologic, psychological and process.\nobserver-rated distress, were often included.\nThe perspective of the individual undergoing vaccination was prioritized for decision-making. Because pain is an iatrogenic harm of vaccination, even small mitigation benefits were considered to be clinically significant. Recommendations were generally applied to broad developmental stages: infants and young children (≤ 3 yr), children (3-12 yr), adolescents (12-17 yr) and adults (≥ 18 yr). Where deemed appropriate, further subdivisions were made or categories collapsed.\nThe guideline was reviewed using the AGREE II framework by individuals and organizations, including the World Health Organization. Changes were made to address concerns raised and then the guideline was finalized.\n\n【2】 #Procedural interventions (injection techniques)\nWe recommend that no aspiration be used during intramuscular vaccine injections in individuals of all ages (strong recommendation; very low confidence in estimates of effect).\nAspiration, a long-standing practice with injection of medications, can increase pain because of the combined effects of a longer needle dwelling time in the tissues and sheering action (wiggling) of the needle. In two studies including 313 infants, there was a benefit to not aspirating on infant acute distress (standardized mean difference  -0.82, 95% confidence interval  -1.18 to -0.46). 8 Aspiration is unnecessary for vaccine injections because of the lack of major blood vessels in the anatomic sites used for injection. 14 In many countries, auto-disable syringes are already used, which preclude aspiration. Slight bleeding at the injection site is common with vaccine injections and does not signal incorrect injection technique. There are no documented harms of not aspirating before vaccination. It is a cost-neutral intervention for pain mitigation.\n\n【3】 #We recommend injecting the most painful vaccine last (rather than first) during vaccine injections in individuals of all ages (strong recommendation; moderate confidence in estimates of effect).\nMany individuals receive more than one vaccine injection at a single visit. The order of vaccine injection matters to overall pain because some vaccines are inherently more painful than others, and pain can escalate with each subsequent injection - We rated candidate clinical questions; a two-thirds majority was set as the cut-off for inclusion in the guideline.\n- We ranked the importance of each outcome on a scale of 1 to 9.\nOutcomes with scores from 7 to 9 were classified as critically important, those with scores from 4 to 6 were classified as important, and those with scores from 1 to 3 were disregarded. Critically important outcomes were prioritized for decision-making.\n- We performed systematic reviews for all included questions.\n- Quality of evidence across critical and important outcomes was assessed as very low, low, moderate or high on the basis of five factors: methodologic limitations, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision and publication bias.\n- The overall quality was assessed based on the lowest confidence for critical outcomes only.\n- Interventions with a large benefit and higher strength of evidence were more likely to receive a strong recommendation.\n(i.e. increased pain intensity following repeated painful stimuli, or hyperalgesia). 15 In two studies including 196 infants, lower overall infant acute distress was observed when the most painful vaccine was given last (SMD -0.69, 95% CI -0.98 to -0.40). 8 There are no cost implications or identified harms from this intervention. Examples of painful vaccines that should be given last include M-M-R II and Prevnar. 6,8\n\n【4】 #Physical interventions (body position and activity) We recommend breastfeeding be used during vaccine injections in children two years and younger (strong recommendation; very low confidence in estimates of effect).\n\n【5】 We recommend holding be used (rather than the child lying supine) during vaccine injections in children three years and younger (strong recommendation; very low confidence in estimates of effect).\nPositioning that is comfortable and promotes proximity soothing from a caregiver should be used. 16 Neonates that are not breastfed can be positioned skin-to-skin (also known as \"kangaroo care\"), which involves placing a diaper-clad baby prone on the mother's bare chest before commencing vaccine injection and continuing during and afterwards. In three studies including 736 neonates, skin-to-skin contact reduced acute distress during the procedure (SMD -0.65, 95% CI -1.05 to -0.25). 8 Holding infants during vaccination reduces acute distress (SMD -1.25, 95% CI -2.05 to -0.46; n = 107). 8 Holding interventions applied after vaccine injections should combine patting and/or rocking. 8 We recommend sitting upright be used (rather than the individual lying supine) during vaccine injections in children three years and older and adults (strong recommendation; low confidence in estimates of effect).\nSitting upright promotes a sense of control in individuals undergoing vaccination, which can have a positive impact on their experience of pain. Sitting upright has been shown to decrease fear (SMD -0.39, 95% CI -0.77 to -0.01; n = 107) and observed distress (SMD -10.3, 95% CI -20.18 to -0.42; n = 107) in children. 8 Children can sit on a parent's lap; this can also assist with keeping still the limbs to be vaccinated. Forcibly restraining children should be avoided because this can increase fear. Children, adolescents and adults can sit upright on their own.\n\n【6】 #Pharmacologic interventions (pain medicine)\nWe recommend topical anesthetics be applied before vaccine injections in children 12 years and younger (strong recommendation; very low confidence in estimates of effect).\nTopical anesthetics are local anestheticcontaining creams, gels and patches that block transmission of pain signals from the skin. 17 Topical anesthetics are a well-established therapy for the mitigation of needle-related pain in individuals of all ages. In a meta-analysis including 1424 children undergoing vaccination, there was a sub- stantial benefit of topical anesthetics on acute distress (SMD -0.91, 95% CI -1.36 to -0.47). 9 There is no evidence of an adverse effect of topical anesthetics on the vaccine immune response. 9 The provision of topical anesthetics should be a standard preventive measure for children, who cannot advocate for themselves and are at risk of long-term harm from unmitigated pain due to the development of needle fears. The majority of children are afraid of needles and report a preference for analgesics to be used. 2,18 Because topical anesthetics incur additional time and costs, their use requires some planning. In many cases, they can be accommodated in usual clinic waiting times. 19 Otherwise, they can be applied before clinic arrival.\nChildren who are not breastfed during vaccine injections can be given sweet-tasting solutions. In the hospital setting, sweet-tasting solutions are an established treatment for pain. Their mechanism of action is not known, but may involve release of endogenous opioids and distraction. In a meta-analysis including 2071 infants undergoing vaccination, the benefit of sucrose solution on infant distress was significant (SMD -0.76, 95% CI -1.19 to -0.34). 9 The typical dose is 2 mL of a 24% to 50% strength solution administered about one to two minutes before injection; glucose can be used if sucrose is not available. This intervention requires additional resources for acquisition of commercially available preparations or manufacturing by clinicians or parents. Alternatively, for infants scheduled to receive oral rotavirus vaccine at the same time as injectable vaccines, rotavirus can be given first because it contains sucrose (as a flavouring agent), which obviates the need for sweet-tasting solutions. 20\n\n【7】 #Process interventions (education and implementation) We recommend education of clinicians administering vaccine injections about pain management (strong recommendation; low confidence in estimates of effect).\nClinicians administering vaccinations are required to be competent in vaccine administration techniques, and this includes pain mitigation. Clinician education increases the use of pain interventions during vaccination (SMD 0.66, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.85; n = 459). 13 We recommend that parents be present during vaccine injections in children 10 years and younger (strong recommendation; very low confidence in estimates of effect).\nChildren show lower levels of distress when parents stay before vaccine injections than when parents leave ,SMD -0.85, 95% CI 1.35 to -0, 13 Family-centred health care promotes caregiver presence whenever possible. 21 Because parents' behaviour can influence a child's level of distress, education of parents is recommended to facilitate child coping and to alleviate pain, fear and distress .\n\n【8】 #We recommend education of parents about pain management before the day of vaccination (strong recommendation; low confidence in estimates of effect).\nParents want to learn about strategies for pain mitigation. 2 Education of parents ahead of time increases use of pain interventions during vaccination (relative risk  2.08, 95% CI 1.51 to 2.86; n = 300). 13\n\n【9】 #We recommend education of parents about pain management on the day of vaccination (strong recommendation; very low confidence in estimates of effect).\nEducating parents on the day of vaccination increases use of pain interventions during vaccination (RR 2.42, 95% CI 1.47 to 3.99; n = 239). 13 Opportunities to learn ahead of time support planning and practice.\n\n【10】 #We recommend education of children three years and older and adults about pain management on the day of vaccination (strong recommendation; very low confidence in estimates of effect).\nIndividuals undergoing vaccination should be given information about what will happen (procedural information), how it will feel (sensory information) and how to cope (training in strategies to mitigate pain and fear).  Information should mostly be given in advance. At the time of the procedure, the focus should be on neutral information about the procedure and coping strategies rather than threatening sensory information that can increase fear. There is evidence that education reduces preprocedural fear in children undergoing vaccination (SMD -0.67, 95% CI -1.28 to -0.07; n = 51). 13\nNo single intervention included in this guideline is expected to prevent all pain (i.e. achieve a level of pain of \"0\"). Individual interventions can be combined, as appropriate, to improve pain relief. For young and school-aged children, because of the high levels of distress with vaccine injections and higher potential for long-term harm (i.e. development of needle fear and health care avoidance), a more comprehensive and consistent approach is recommended. With maturity, a more self-directed and individualized approach can be used.\nPain mitigation is considered part of good vaccination clinical practice by the World Health Organization, which has accepted the most practical interventions from this guideline for global implementation. 25 All involved in vaccination programs need to identify and support clinician interest, willingness and ability to adopt these guideline recommendations to achieve best practices. Additional resources (e.g. supplies, personnel) may be required to educate and support clinicians, parents and individuals to implement these recommendations.\nMethods already used for education about vaccination (e.g. verbal instruction, pamphlets, videos) are effective for education about pain mitigation. Sample resources are currently available from Immunize Canada\nImportantly, many pain mitigation interventions can be offered for little or no cost. Even for those with costs, the costs may be offset by avoiding the costs of subsequent harm from unmitigated pain and fear, including the negative impact on health outcomes due to vaccine hesitancy and noncompliance with other health care interventions, and the costs for treatment of needle fears that have developed due to poorly managed pain. Performance metrics can include clinical indicators (e.g. pain intensity, fear intensity), process indicators (e.g. use of pain interventions, compliance with vaccination) and conceptual indicators (e.g. knowledge, satisfaction).\nWe plan to update the guideline in the next 5-10 years , depending on the availability of new research evidence and project funding.\n\n【11】 #Other guidelines\n\n【12】 #Gaps in knowledge\nThe guideline recommendations are limited to the available evidence, and certain recommendations have more research support than others. There was a noticeable gap in research evidence for adolescent and adult populations, and mass vaccination settings, even though concerns about pain and fear are well documented and contribute to vaccine hesitancy. School-based vaccinations should be specifically targeted to facilitate more positive experiences with health care for children.\nData are needed on the painfulness of different vaccines (including their route of administration), aspects of vaccine injection technique (e.g. speed of injection and injection in a single limb for multiple vaccine injections), and vaccine formulations and delivery systems that minimize pain. Given the potential role of memory for pain and fear in subsequent experiences of pain, 27 research is needed to examine the efficacy of interventions for memory reframing. Studies on the impact of pain interventions on future pain and vaccine compliance are also warranted to show the long-term impact of pain interventions.\nPain during vaccination is an important concern across the lifespan. This guideline provides recommendations for interventions that can mitigate vaccination pain. Many interventions are feasible across vaccination settings.\nCompeting interests: Anna Taddio declares a grant from Pfizer, and study supplies from Natus and Ferndale.

It is one of the four isomers of butanol.  tert-Butanol is a clear liquid with a camphor-like odor.  It is well soluble in water and miscible with ethanol and diethyl ether. It is unique among the isomers of butanol because it tends to be a solid at room temperature, with a melting point slightly above 25 degrees Celsius.\n\n【2】 #Applications\ntert-Butanol is used as a solvent, as a denaturant for ethanol, as an ingredient in paint removers, as an octane booster for gasoline, as an oxygenate gasoline additive, and as an intermediate in the synthesis of other chemical commodities such as flavors and perfumes.\n\n【3】 #Preparation\ntert-Butanol can be manufactured industrially by the catalytic hydration of isobutylene.\n\n【4】 #Chemistry\nAs a tertiary alcohol, tert-butanol is more stable to oxidation and less reactive than the other isomers of butanol.\nWhen tert-butanol is deprotonated with a strong base, the product is an alkoxide anion.

It is defined by short QT intervals  (≤ 360 ms) that increases an individual propensity to atrial and ventricular tachyarrhythmias. It occurs due to gain-of-function mutations in genes encoding for cardiac potassium channels KCNH2, KCNQ1 and KCNJ2. The shortened QT interval does not significantly change with heart rate, and there are tall and peaked T waves in the right precordium. It is associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation, syncope and sudden death.\n\n【2】 #Historical Perspective\nThe syndrome was first described by Dr. Prebe Bjerregaard MD, DMSc in 1999, who wrote the first clinical report of three members of one family who presented with persistently short QT interval.\n\n【3】 #Classification\n- Short QT syndrome type 1 (SQT1): This variant is due to a gain-of-function mutation of the rapid component of the delayed rectifier potassium current HERG (KCNH2) channel(IKr). The variant is a result of missense mutations which increase IKr. It is associated with sudden death and sudden infant death syndrome.\n- Short QT syndrome type 6 (SQT6):  A loss of function mutation in the CACNAD2D1 coding for the Cavα2δ-1 subunit of the L-type calcium channel.\n\n【4】 #Pathophysiology\nShort QT syndrome types 1-3 are due to increased activity of outward potassium currents in phase 2 and 3 of the cardiac action potential due to mutations in potassium channels. This causes a shortening of the plateau phase of the action potential (phase 2), causing a shortening of the overall action potential, leading to an overall shortening of refractory periods and the QT interval. In the families afflicted by short QT syndrome, two different missense mutations have been described in the human ether-a-go-go gene (HERG).  These mutations result in expression of the same amino acid change in the cardiac IKr ion channel.  This mutated IKr has increased activity compared to the normal ion channel, and would theoretically explain the above hypothesis.  Short QT syndrome types 4 and 5 and 6 are due to mutations in the calcium channel and consequent reduction  in L-type Ca-channel current.\n\n【5】 ## Genetics\nIn the families afflicted by short QT syndrome, mutations have been described in three genes, KvLQT1, the human ether-a-go-go gene (HERG), and KCNJ2.  Mutations in the KCNH2, KCNJ2, and KCNQ1 genes cause short QT syndrome. These genes provide instructions for making proteins that act as channels across the cell membrane. These channels transport positively charged atoms (ions) of potassium into and out of cells. In cardiac muscle, these ion channels play critical roles in maintaining the heart's normal rhythm. Mutations in the KCNH2, KCNJ2, or KCNQ1 gene increase the activity of the channels, which changes the flow of potassium ions between cells. This disruption in ion transport alters the way the heart beats, leading to the abnormal heart rhythm characteristic of short QT syndrome. Short QT syndrome appears to have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance.\nDue to the autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, individuals may have family members with a history of unexplained or sudden death at a young age (even in infancy), palpitations, or atrial fibrillation.  The penetrance of symptoms is high in affected family members. It is also interesting to note that while mutations involving potassium channel genes associated with the long QT syndrome are loss-of-function mutations, the mutations that cause short QT syndrome are gain-of-function mutations.\nThe calcium channels' dysfunction are mostly due to CACNA1C and CACNB2b genes mutation which caused Brugada-like ECG changes with short QT interval. Lastly, a novel mutation of the CACNA2D1 gene was reported in a 17-year-old female who presented with short QT interval and ventricular fibrillation.\n\n【6】 #Causes\nThe causes of shortening of the QT interval can be divided into primary causes (Short QT syndrome types 1-5) and secondary causes such as drugs and electrolyte disturbances.\n\n【7】 ## Common Causes\n- Hypercalcemia - Digoxin\n\n【8】 ## Causes in Alphabetical Order\n- Acidosis - Altered autonomic tone\n- Digoxin\n- Hypercalcaemia - Lanatoside C\n- Rufinamide\n- Short QT syndrome type 1\n\n【9】 ## Differentiating Short QT Syndrome from other Disorders\nShort QT may have secondary causes that must be ruled out, since the short QT syndrome is by definition a primary, congenital disease of the heart. Such causes include: hyperkalemia, hypercalcemia, acidosis, hyperthermia - caused by the use of drugs like digitalis, effect of acetylcholine or catecholamine and activation of Katp or Kach current. Only after ruling out such causes is that the diagnosis of short QT syndrome may be made.\n\n【10】 #Epidemiology and Demographics\nEuropean studies have estimated a prevalence of 0.02% to 0.1% among adults. A paper from 2015 which tried to assess the prevalence among pediatric population in the U.S. estimated a prevalence of 0.05% at this population. Sudden cardiac arrest has a peak incidence between the second and fourth decades of life, which might indicate an association with testosterone levels in males.\n\n【11】 #Natural History, Complications, Prognosis\nThe disease can have clinical manifestations from the first year of life until as late as 80 years old, and most cases are symptomatic. Its most frequent symptoms include cardiac arrest (which was the first symptom in 28% of the patients), followed by palpitations, and syncope. Patients may also present with atrial fibrillation and ventricular extrasystoles. They remain at high risk for sudden death during their lifetime and may present with a strong family history for this occurence. Sudden cardiac death presents with two high-risk peaks, one in the first year of life, and another one from 20 to 40 years old. Even though familial association is present in the majority of patients, the yields for genetic tests is low.\n\n【12】 #Screening\nSince the disease is so rare, no screening for the general population is advised. Individuals with short QT interval detected on the ECG must first rule out other causes. Genetic screening is performed if a patient presents with: sudden cardiac arrest, history of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation without a known cause, history of unexplained syncope, young individuals with atrial fibrillation, family members diagnosed with short QT syndrome, family members who died from sudden cardiac arrest.\n\n【13】 #Diagnosis\nThe first step for diagnosing short QT syndrome is ruling out secondary causes, such as the ones cited above. Once them are ruled out, there are two suggested diagnostic approaches in the medical literature: one proposed by GOLLOB, and another one proposed by PRIORI:\n- Scoring type of diagnostic criteria, as proposed by the Arrhythmia Research Laboratory at the University of Ottawa Heart Institute from Drs. Michael H Gollob and Jason D Roberts.\nThe points are summed and interpreted as follows:\n- > or equal to 4 points: High-probability of SQTS\n- 3 Points: Intermediate probability of SQTS\n- Diagnostic criteria suggested by PRIORI, 2015 for the European Society of Cardiology:\n- QTc <340ms or QTc <360ms and one or more of the following:\nConfirmed pathogenic mutation;\nFamily history of SQTS;\nSurvival from a VT/VF episode at the absence of heart diseases.\n- Family history of sudden death at 40 years of age;\n\n【14】 ### Duration of the QT Interval\nWhile the QT interval is generally short, the QT interval alone cannot be used to distinguish the patient with short QT syndrome from a normal patient (similar to long QT syndrome).  In general though, if the QTc is < 330 msec in a male, and <340 msec in a female, then short QT syndrome can be diagnosed even in the absence of symptoms as these QT intervals are much shorter than in the rest of the population.  On the other hand, if the QTc is moderately shortened to < 360 msec in a male or < 370 msec in a female, the short QT syndrome should only be diagnosed in the presence of symptoms or a family history according to the guidelines above.\nThe QTc is usually < 300-320 msec.\n\n【15】 ### Variability of the QT Interval with Heart Rate\nThe short QT interval does not vary significantly with the heart rate.  Normally the QT will become longer at slow heart rates and this does not occur among patients with short QT syndrome.  The Bazett formula may overcorrect (i.e. shorten) the QT interval in the patient with bradycardia, and it is therefore important to use treadmill testing to increase the heart rate and confirm the absence of QT interval variation.\n\n【16】 ### Other ECG findings:\n- There is a high prevalence of early depolarization patterns on SQTS.\n- QRS complex is followed by T wave without any ST segment.\n- Prominent U wave separated by isoelectric T-U segment.\n- Longer Tpeak - Tend interval.\n- Prolongation of the QT interval at slower heart rates is suppressed, remaining below the lower limit.\n- Depressed PQ segment commonly observed in the inferior and anterior leads.\n- In a very limited number of patients it has been observed that early repolarization (which is present in 65% of patients with SQTS) and a longer T wave peak to T wave end period is associated with the occurrence of arrhythmic events.\n70% of patients with short QT have a history of either paroxysmal atrial fibrillation or permanent atrial fibrillation, and atrial fibrillation is the first sign of short QT syndrome in 50% of patients.  In young patients with lone atrial fibrillation, the patient should be screened for short QT syndrome.\n\n【17】 ## Electrophysiologic Studies\nAmong patients with SQTS, the atrial and ventricular refractory periods are shortened (ranging from 120 to 180 ms).  Ventricular fibrillation can be induced on programmed stimulation in 90% of patients with short QT syndrome.  Despite the high rate of VF inducibility, the risk of sudden death in an individual patient is difficult to predict given the genetic and clinical heterogeneity of short QT syndrome and the limited number of patients with short follow-up to date.  The limitations of electrophysiologic testing are highlighted by a study of Giustetto et al in which the sensitivity of electrophysiologic testing in relation to the clinical occurrence of ventricular fibrillation was only 50% (3 of 6 cases).  Importantly, lack of inducibility does not exclude a future episode of ventricular fibrillation.  Thus, the role of electrophysiologic testing in risk stratification of the patient with SQTS is not clear at present.\n\n【18】 ## Genetic Testing\nBecause new genetic variants of SQTS are still being identified, a negative genetic test for existing variants does not exclude the presence of SQTS.  A negative genetic test for existing variants could mean that a patient with a short QT interval does not have a heretofore unidentified variant of SQTS.\nHowever, among family members of an affected patient, genetic testing may identify the syndrome in an asymptomatic patient, and may also rule out the presence of the syndrome in asymptomatic patients.\nMutations in the KCNH2, KCNJ2, and KCNQ1 genes cause short QT syndrome. These genes provide instructions for making proteins that act as channels across the cell membrane. These channels transport positively charged atoms (ions) of potassium into and out of cells. In cardiac muscle, these ion channels play critical roles in maintaining the heart's normal rhythm. Mutations in the KCNH2, KCNJ2, or KCNQ1 gene increase the activity of the channels, which changes the flow of potassium ions between cells. This disruption in ion transport alters the way the heart beats, leading to the abnormal heart rhythm characteristic of short QT syndrome. Short QT syndrome appears to have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance.\n\n【19】 ### Centers Performing Genetic Testing for Short QT Syndrome\n- Gene Tests: Short QT Syndrome 1\n\n【20】 ## Device Based Therapy\nAn implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is indicated in symptomatic patients who have either survived a sudden cardiac arrest and/or have had documented episodes of spontaneous sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias with or without syncope. There's a problem with ICD in such patients though, because the tall and peaked T wave can be interpreted as a short R-R interval provoking inappropriate shock.\nGenerally accepted criteria for implantation of an AICD also include:\n- Inducibility on electrophysiologic testing;\n- Positive genetic test, although a negative result does not exclude the presence of a previously unreported mutation or the occurrence of a future arrhythmic event.\n\n【21】 ### Complications of AICD Placement\nInappropriate shocks may be delivered due to:\n- The occurence of tachycardias such as sinus tachycardia and atrial fibrillation.\n- Oversensing of the tall, narrow peaked T wave.\n\n【22】 ### Short QT Syndrome 1 (SQT1)\nThe efficacy of pharmacotherapy in preventing ventricular fibrillation has only been studies in patients with SQT1.  Given the limited number of patients studied, and the limited duration of follow-up, pharmacotherapy as primary or secondary preventive therapy for patients with SQT1 cannot be recommended at this time.  AICD implantation remains the mainstay of therapy in these patients\nPatients with Short QT Syndrome 1 (SQT1) have a mutation in KCNH2 (HERG).  Class IC and III antiarrhythmic drugs do not produce any significant QT interval prolongation  . Flecainide has not been shown to consistently reduce the inducibility of ventricular fibrillation. Although it does not prolong the QT interval in SQT1 patients, propafenone reduces the risk of recurrent atrial fibrillation in SQT1 patients.\nQuinidine in contrast may be effective in patients with SQT1 in so far as it blocks both potassium channels (IKr, IKs, Ito, IKATP and IK1) and the inward sodium and calcium channels.  In four out of four patients, Quinidine prolonged the QT interval from 263 +/- 12 msec to 362 +/-25 msec, most likely due to its effects on prolonging the action potential and by virtue of its action on the IK channels. Although Quinidine was successful in preventing the inducibility of ventricular fibrillation in 4 out of 4 patients, it is unclear if the prolongation of the QT interval by quinidine would reduce the risk of sudden cardiac death. It also prolonged the ST interval and T wave durations, restored the heart rate dependent variability in the QT interval and decreased depolarization dispersion in patients with SQT1.\nThere is a report which states that disopyramide was also effectively used in two patients with SQT-1, increasing their QT interval and ventricular refractory period while also abbreviating the Tpeak-Tend interval.\nAs atrial fibrillation is also very commonly found on those patients propafenone has also been successfully used to prevent its paroxysms, without having any effect on QT interval.\nAlthough pharmacotherapy can be used to suppress the occurrence of atrial fibrillation in patients with SQT1, AICD implantation is the mainstay of therapy, and pharmacotherapy to prevent sudden death should is only indicated if AICD implantation is not possible.\n\n【23】 ### Indications for Pharmacologic Therapy\nThe following are indications for pharmacologic therapy of SQTS:\n- In children as an alternate to AICD implantation;\n- In patients with appropriate AICD discharges to reduce the frequency of discharges;", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

NOTE: Care gaps have been identified at important transitions for this group of patients: - upon receiving a diagnosis of incurable cancer; - when discharged from active treatment to the community; - while still ambulatory but needing pain and symptom management; and - at the transition when End-of-Life care may be needed. Diagnostic code: 239 (neoplasm of unspecified nature) Palliative care planning fee code: G14063- Identify patients who would benefit from palliative care early in the illness trajectory: a palliative approach addresses the need for pain and symptom management, as well as psychosocial and spiritual support of patients and their families, beginning in disease management through to survivorship or End-of-Life care. - Encourage patients to have an advance care planning discussion with family and/or caregivers. - Establish goals of care with the patient and families/caregivers. - Before ordering investigations, ensure that the results will change management to improve quality of life and/or prognostication, consistent with the patient's goals of care. - Organize care coordination around key illness transitions.The World Health Organization 1 defines palliative care as an approach that improves the quality of life of patients and their families facing the problems associated with life-threatening illness, through the prevention and relief of suffering by means of early identification and impeccable assessment and treatment of pain and other problems, physical, psychosocial, and spiritual. Palliative care: - provides relief from pain and other distressing symptoms; - affirms life and regards dying as a normal process; - intends neither to hasten nor postpone death; - integrates the psychological and spiritual aspects of patient; - offers a support system to help patients live as actively as possible until death; - offers a support system to help the family cope during the patient's illness and in their own bereavement; - uses a team approach to address the needs of patients and their families, including bereavement counselling, if indicated; 'Total care' means that the patient is completely unable to eat without help, toilet or do any self-care. Depending on the clinical situation, the patient may or may not be able to chew and swallow food once prepared and fed to him or her\n\n【1】 #\n- will enhance quality of life, and may also positively influence the course of illness; and - is applicable early in the course of illness, in conjunction with other therapies that are intended to prolong life, such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy, and includes those investigations needed to better understand and manage distressing clinical complications.\nThe bow tie model of 21st century palliative care consists of two overlapping triangles resembling a bow tie, with an arrow pointing from left to right. 2 The first triangle represents disease management and the second triangle is palliative care. The base of the palliative care triangle (end of the model) includes both death and survival as possible outcomes. The arrow indicates that this is a dynamic process with a gradual switch in focus. The key difference between this and traditional models is that survivorship is included as a possible outcome. Patients diagnosed with incurable cancer or advanced disease may not identify themselves as requiring palliative care. A palliative approach addresses the need for pain and symptom management, and the psychosocial and spiritual support of patients and their families, even if they choose to undergo life-prolonging treatments such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and/or surgery.\nA proactive chronic disease management approach will help prevent care gaps that may occur during transitions in care and/or when the patient is not supported by a cancer agency or community hospice palliative care program.\nA palliative approach is needed for patients living with active, progressive, life-limiting illnesses who need pain and symptom management and support around practical or psychosocial issues, have care needs that would benefit from a coordinated or collaborative care approach, and/or have frequent emergency room visits. Assess where patients are in their illness trajectory, functional status, and symptom burden. Clarify goals of care in a culturally sensitive manner.\nEstimating prognosis allows optimal use of limited time for patients and families. Rapid change in clinical condition is an understandable and helpful sign. Although prognoses can only be estimated, poor prognostic factors include:\n- progressive weight loss (especially > 10% over 6 months);\n\n【2】 - dyspnea; - dysphagia; and - cognitive impairment.\n\n【3】 Before ordering investigations, ensure that the results will change management to improve quality of life and/or prognostication, consistent with the patient's goals of care. Investigations may be indicated to:\n- better understand and manage distressing clinical complications;\n- assist in determining prognosis;\n- clarify appropriate goals of care; and - determine whether all options have been considered before admission to hospice.\nEvaluate performance status and symptom burden in order to accurately assess a patient's need for added supports and symptom management. Assessment scales are commonly used to facilitate communication and collaboration among providers ,e.g\n\n【4】 #Monitor patient's functional capacity\n\"The single most important predictive factor in cancer is performance status and functional ability -if patients are spending more than 50% of their time in bed/lying down, prognosis is likely to be about three months or less\". 3 The SPICT outlines general and disease-specific indicators and is used to assess patients for the BC Palliative Care benefits program (Associated Document: Information about BC Palliative Care Benefits).\n\n【5】 #Coordinate care with allied health care providers\nOrganize care coordination around key illness transitions. 4 To enhance coordination with allied health providers involved in the care of the patient, the following steps are recommended:\n\n【6】 #Evaluate symptom burden\nPain and other symptoms are assigned a numerical rating between 0 (none) and 10 (most severe imaginable). Record the level and range of symptom severity, aiming for ≤ 3 and thoroughly assess for values ≥ 4\n- 3: able to watch TV or read newspaper without paying much attention to pain.\n- 5: pain is too distracting to find much pleasure in activities (e.g. TV, reading).\n- > 5: on the verge of being or already overwhelmed by pain.\n- 10: the worse pain that you could imagine.\n\n【7】 #Establish goals of care with patients and families\nAs the underlying condition progresses, a patient's goals of care often become less disease-specific and more palliative.\nDiscuss a patient's wishes before clinical deterioration, possibly over several visits. Start by determining how much the patient desires to know about their disease and how much they desire to participate in decision making. When translation is required, a professional interpreter (rather than a family member) is advisable. - Establish the caregiver's ability to provide care at home, if that is the patient's preference.\n- Review the goals of care regularly, and when there is a change in clinical status.\n\n【8】 #Management strategies: non-pharmacologic\nLifestyle management - Exercise: Regular exercise and activity has been proven to improve quality of life and function in cancer survivors. 7\n- Nutrition: Nutritional needs are different for patients with cancer as their appetite is often reduced and forcing additional food may contribute to nausea or vomiting. When the goal is life prolongation, a consultation with a dietitian may be helpful. - Rest: Fatigue is a common accompaniment of cancer or its treatment. Adequate rest and pacing of activities is important. Poor sleep will contribute to a lower quality of life for both the patient and caregiver.\n\n【9】 - Encourage patients to have an advance care planning discussion with family and/or caregivers (for an example see the \"My Voice\" booklet in the Resource Guide). - Symptom reporting: Suggest that patients record symptoms using a numerical rating scale (0 = none to 10 = extreme) and report symptoms consistently ≥ 4. - Medications: Suggest that patients keep up-to-date medication profiles to carry with them to appointments and ER visits, including flow sheets to record breakthrough medication. Ensure that treatment of incident pain is understood. - Bowel protocol: Constipation, an opioid side effect, does not improve over time.\n\n【10】 #Management strategies: pharmacotherapy\n\n【11】 #Referral to a specialist\nIndications for referral to a tertiary palliative care unit - Referral is indicated for control of pain and other symptoms when these cannot be met in the community, and for support for severe psychological, spiritual, or social distress.\n\n【12】 #Ongoing care Planned visits\n- A shared care plan, complete with planned follow-up visits, helps patients and families feel supported.\n- Recommended visit frequency depends on prognosis. For example, if the illness is stable (PPS ≥70%), quarterly visits are recommended, but if the illness is changing monthly, then visit monthly. More frequent planned visits are warranted in the face of more rapid decline.\n\n【13】 - Prognostic factors: Monitor for impending transition or crisis (e.g. new or accelerated weight loss, dyspnea, cognitive impairment, or change in PPS). - Signs and symptoms: Each visit, record pain scale for each pain type and location.\n- Medications: In addition to slow release opioid, record use of breakthrough medications, antinauseants, and bowel protocol.\n\n【14】 #Medical Assistance in Dying (MAiD)\nIt is likely that some conversations about end of life may result in patients or families wanting to discuss Medical Assistance in Dying (MAiD). A palliative approach to care is appropriate for all people living with chronic life-threatening illness, whether or not they choose MAiD, and specialist palliative care consultation is encouraged if MAiD is being considered.

Clear arrangements should be in place for the involvement of different clinical disciplines in treatment and follow-up.\nPatients with subarachnoid haemorrhage should have rapid access to appropriate specialist care\n\n【2】 #The procedure\n\n【3】 #Indications\nIntracranial aneurysms are small balloon-like dilated portions of blood vessels that may occasionally rupture, causing haemorrhage, stroke or death. Usually the cause is unknown but people with genetic causes of weak blood vessels are more likely to develop aneurysms. Rupture of intracranial aneurysms causes subarachnoid haemorrhage and has a poor prognosis. About 30% of people die within 24 hours and a further 25–30% die within 4 weeks.\nThe alternative treatment for ruptured intracranial aneurysm involves open surgery to clip the aneurysm inside the skull.\n\n【4】 #Outline of the procedure\nThe coil technique involves approaching the aneurysm from inside the diseased blood vessel, thereby avoiding the need to open the skull. A thin tube containing the coil on a guidewire is inserted into a large artery, usually in the groin, and passed up into the skull under radiological guidance. The coil is placed inside the aneurysm and detached from the guidewire. Once in position, it causes clotting and stops blood from entering the aneurysm. Multiple coils may be inserted into the aneurysm through the same tube until the aneurysm is filled with coils.\n\n【5】 #Efficacy\nUse of the procedure was supported by a high-quality randomised controlled trial. In the trial, 'dependency' reflected a moderate to severe disability as defined by the modified Rankin score. The trial showed a 7% absolute risk reduction in dependency or death for patients treated with coils compared with patients treated by surgical clipping\nThe Specialist Advisors stated that, in the short term, the procedure is more effective clinically than surgical clipping. However, the long-term durability of coil embolisation has not been established.\n\n【6】 #Safety\nComplications associated with the procedure included perforation of the aneurysm, intracranial haematoma and re-bleeding. In a case series of 403 patients, aneurysm perforation was observed in 11 patients (3%) and cerebral clot embolisation in 10 patients (2%). Coil migration occurred in two patients (0.5%)\nThe Specialist Advisors considered this procedure to be safer than surgical clipping. They stated that procedural mortality and stroke were the main adverse events. They also stated that there is a small risk of re-bleeding, and that this should be monitored over the long term.\n\n【7】 #Other comments\nCurrently, evidence on the procedure's long-term results is limited to a mean follow-up of 3.7 years.\nThis guidance relates to ruptured intracranial aneurysms.  also published separate NICE guidance on the use of coil embolisation for unruptured intracranial aneurysms.\nIn 2002, the Royal College of Physicians published guidelines on the management of stroke, including subarachnoid haemorrhage.\n\n【8】 #\nThe evidence considered by the Interventional Procedures Advisory Committee is described in the overview to this guidance.\n\n【9】 #Information for patients\nNICE has produced information on this procedure for patients and carers ('Understanding NICE guidance').

Inhibition of HIV protease renders the enzyme incapable of processing the gag-pol polyprotein precursor which leads to production of non-infectious immature HIV-1 particles.\n\n【2】 ## Antiviral Activity in Cell Culture\nThe activity of ritonavir was assessed in acutely infected lymphoblastoid cell lines and in peripheral blood lymphocytes. The concentration of drug that inhibits 50% (EC50) value of viral replication ranged from 3.8 to 153 nM depending upon the HIV-1 isolate and the cells employed. The average EC50 for low passage clinical isolates was 22 nM (n = 13). In MT4 cells, ritonavir demonstrated additive effects against HIV-1 in combination with either didanosine (ddI) or zidovudine (ZDV). Studies which measured cytotoxicity of ritonavir on several cell lines showed that greater than 20 µM was required to inhibit cellular growth by 50% resulting in a cell culture therapeutic index of at least 1,000.\n\n【3】 ## Resistance\nHIV-1 isolates with reduced susceptibility to ritonavir have been selected in cell culture. Genotypic analysis of these isolates showed mutations in the HIV-1 protease gene encoding at amino acid substitutions I84V, V82F, A71V, and M46I. Phenotypic (n = 18) and genotypic (n = 48) changes in HIV-1 isolates from selected patients treated with ritonavir were monitored in phase I/II trials over a period of 3 to 32 weeks. Substitutions associated with the HIV-1 viral protease in isolates obtained from 43 patients appeared to occur in a stepwise and ordered fashion; in sequence, these substitutions were position V82A/F/T/S, I54V, A71V/T, and I36L, followed by combinations of substitutions at an additional 5 specific amino acid positions (M46I/L, K20R, I84V, L33F and L90M). Of 18 patients for whom both phenotypic and genotypic analysis were performed on free virus isolated from plasma, 12 showed reduced susceptibility to ritonavir in cell culture. All 18 patients possessed one or more substitutions in the viral protease gene. The V82A/F substitution appeared to be necessary but not sufficient to confer phenotypic resistance. Phenotypic resistance was defined as a greater than or equal to 5-fold decrease in viral sensitivity in cell culture from baseline.\n\n【4】 ## Cross-Resistance to Other Antiretrovirals\nAmong protease inhibitors variable cross-resistance has been recognized. Serial HIV-1 isolates obtained from six patients during ritonavir therapy showed a decrease in ritonavir susceptibility in cell culture but did not demonstrate a concordant decrease in susceptibility to saquinavir in cell culture when compared to matched baseline isolates. However, isolates from two of these patients demonstrated decreased susceptibility to indinavir in cell culture (8-fold). Isolates from 5 patients were also tested for cross-resistance to amprenavir and nelfinavir; isolates from 3 patients had a decrease in susceptibility to nelfinavir (6- to 14-fold), and none to amprenavir. Cross-resistance between ritonavir and reverse transcriptase inhibitors is unlikely because of the different enzyme targets involved.

In 1988, Leslie and Frith repeated the experiment with human actors (rather than dolls) and found similar results.\n\n【1】 #Test description\nThe experimenter uses two dolls, \"Sally\" and \"Anne\". Sally has a basket; Anne has a box. Experimenters show their subjects (usually children) a simple skit, in which Sally puts a marble in her basket and then leaves the scene. While Sally is away and cannot watch, Anne takes the marble out of Sally's basket and puts it into her box. Sally then returns and the children are asked where they think she will look for her marble. Children are said to \"pass\" the test if they understand that Sally will most likely look inside her basket before realizing that her marble isn't there.\nNormal children under the age of four, along with most autistic children (of all ages), will answer \"Anne's box,\" seemingly unaware that Sally does not know her marble has been moved.\nIn the Baron-Cohen study of theory of mind in autism, 61 children were tested with \"Sally\" and \"Anne\".\nAfter introducing the dolls, the child's ability to name those dolls was tested (the Naming Question).\nAfter this, Sally takes a marble and hides it in her basket. She then leaves the room and goes for a walk. When Sally is away, and therefore unknown to her, Anne takes the marble out of Sally's basket and puts it in her own box. Sally returns and the child is asked the key question: 'Where will Sally look for her marble?' (the Belief Question).\nTwo control questions were then asked—the Reality Question and the Memory Question.\nThe Reality question is \"Where is the marble really?\". This is to make sure the child had paid attention to the transfer of the marble from the basket to the box.\nFor the children to succeed in this task they have pass the 'Belief Question'. The children have to show that Sally has her own beliefs which may not match up with how things really are. The correct response to the 'Belief Question' is to indicate Sally's basket. This will show that the child knows that Sally believes the marble is in her basket. The incorrect response is to point to Anne's box (Sally doesn't know that Anne hid her marble in the box).\n\n【2】 #Interpretation\nChildren who pass the test (presumably) understand that there are two different sets of beliefs:\n- their own beliefs, based on what they have personally seen, heard, remembered, imagined, reasoned, etc. and - to recognize that other people have perceptions/feelings/beliefs/thoughts/etc. different from their own;\n- to \"mind-read\" (or \"mind-guess\") other people's thoughts and feelings;\n- and to predict (or even interfere with) other people's third-party relationships.\nThose children who fail the test are said by some psychologists to lack a \"theory of mind.\" (In this context, \"mind\" refers to psychological processes such as perception, belief, thought, or memory.) However, failing the Sally-Anne test does not mean that an individual has no awareness of mental states: great apes and very young children, who typically fail the test, nonetheless show other sophisticated social behaviors (such as empathy).\n\n【3】 #Great apes and other monkeys\nSince other great apes are not known to have a human-like theory of mind, it is assumed that it evolved after our ancestors diverged from other great apes. Suddendorf has suggested that this occurred with H. erectus (dating from 1.8 mya). Current research has failed, however, to disprove conclusively a theory of mind in other great apes and some new world monkeys outside the family of great apes, as for example the capuchin monkeys.\n\n【4】 #Criticism\nStrictly speaking, the scenario presented in the test does not give sufficient information to determine Sally's expectations about the location of the marble.  For example, it is not said whether Sally and Anne had previously discussed possible locations for the marble.  Thus \"I don't know\" is, in a sense, the most correct answer.\nA positive answer can be reached only by making assumptions about the unstated parts of the situation.  There are many possible sets of assumptions that could be made, and the small number of likely answers means that the test cannot adequately distinguish between many of the possible assumptions.  Furthermore, the categorisation of responses into \"passes\" and \"failures\" throws away most of that information.  There are several ways to pass, and vastly more ways to fail.\nThese problems make the test of limited use as a diagnostic tool.  The standard interpretation of the test identifies a particular stage in the most common pattern of development of social understanding, but it is misleading when applied to subjects who are not following the standard pattern.  This is of particular concern with autistics, who are commonly diagnosed as lacking a theory of mind on the basis of \"failing\" the test.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

In the absence of human serum, the mean 50% effective concentration (EC50) values of lopinavir against five different HIV-1 subtype B laboratory strains ranged from 10-27 nM (0.006-0.017 µg/mL, 1 µg/mL = 1.6 µM) and ranged from 4-11 nM (0.003-0.007 µg/mL) against several HIV-1 subtype B clinical isolates (n = 6). In the presence of 50% human serum, the mean EC50 values of lopinavir against these five HIV-1 laboratory strains ranged from 65-289 nM (0.04-0.18 µg/mL), representing a 7 to 11-fold attenuation. Combination antiviral drug activity studies with lopinavir in cell cultures demonstrated additive to antagonistic activity with nelfinavir and additive to synergistic activity with amprenavir, atazanavir, indinavir, saquinavir and tipranavir. The EC50 values of lopinavir against three different HIV-2 strains ranged from 12-180 nM (0.008-113 μg/mL).\nResistance\nHIV-1 isolates with reduced susceptibility to lopinavir have been selected in cell culture. The presence of ritonavir does not appear to influence the selection of lopinavir-resistant viruses in cell culture.\nResistance to KALETRA has been noted to emerge in patients treated with other protease inhibitors prior to KALETRA therapy. In studies of 227 antiretroviral treatment naïve and protease inhibitor experienced patients, isolates from 4 of 23 patients with quantifiable (> 400 copies/mL) viral RNA following treatment with KALETRA for 12 to 100 weeks displayed significantly reduced susceptibility to lopinavir compared to the corresponding baseline viral isolates. Three of these patients had previously received treatment with a single protease inhibitor (indinavir, nelfinavir, or saquinavir) and one patient had received treatment with multiple protease inhibitors (indinavir, ritonavir, and saquinavir). All four of these patients had at least 4 substitutions associated with protease inhibitor resistance immediately prior to KALETRA therapy. Following viral rebound, isolates from these patients all contained additional substitutions, some of which are recognized to be associated with protease inhibitor resistance. However, there are insufficient data at this time to identify patterns of lopinavir resistance-associated substitutions in isolates from patients on KALETRA therapy. The assessment of these patterns is under study.\nCross-resistance - Preclinical Studies\nVarying degrees of cross-resistance have been observed among HIV-1 protease inhibitors. Little information is available on the cross-resistance of viruses that developed decreased susceptibility to lopinavir during KALETRA therapy.\nThe antiviral activity in cell culture of lopinavir against clinical isolates from patients previously treated with a single protease inhibitor was determined. Isolates that displayed > 4-fold reduced susceptibility to nelfinavir (n = 13) and saquinavir (n = 4), displayed  4-fold reduced susceptibility to indinavir (n = 16) and ritonavir (n = 3) displayed a mean of 5.7- and 8.3-fold reduced susceptibility to lopinavir, respectively. Isolates from patients previously treated with two or more protease inhibitors showed greater reductions in susceptibility to lopinavir, as described in the following paragraph.\nClinical Studies - Antiviral Activity of KALETRA in Patients with Previous Protease Inhibitor Therapies\nThe clinical relevance of reduced susceptibility in cell culture to lopinavir has been examined by assessing the virologic response to KALETRA therapy in treatment-experienced patients, with respect to baseline viral genotype in three studies and baseline viral phenotype in one study.\nVirologic response to KALETRA has been shown to be affected by the presence of three or more of the following amino acid substitutions in protease at baseline: L10F/I/R/V, K20M/N/R, L24I, L33F, M36I, I47V, G48V, I54L/T/V, V82A/C/F/S/T, and I84V Once daily administration of KALETRA for adult patients with three or more of the above substitutions is not recommended.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "9b29542f-326a-47a9-a9ee-99c15f4e51f5", "title": null, "text": "【0】 Base excision repair\nSingle bases in DNA can be chemically mutated, for example by deamination or alkylation, resulting in incorrect base-pairing, and consequently, mutations in the DNA. Base excision repair involves flipping the mutated base out of the DNA helix and repairing the base alone. There are two main enzymes used, DNA glycosylases and AP endonucleases. The DNA glycosylase is used to break the β-N glycosidic bond to create an AP site. AP endonuclease recognizes this site and nicks the damaged DNA on the 5' side (upstream) of the AP site creating a free 3'-OH. DNA polymerase, Pol I, extends the DNA from the free 3'-OH using its exonuclease activity to replace the nucleotide of the damaged base, as well as a few downstream, followed by sealing of the new DNA strand by DNA ligase.\n\n【1】 #DNA glycosylases\nThere are specific DNA glycosylases that recognize different damaged bases. For example, there are two oxoG glycosylases – the first removes oxoG that is bound to cytosine, repairing the actual damaged base, whereas the second removes an adenine bound to oxoG, removing the incorrect base before the next replication.  A Uracil DNA glycosylase recognizes uracil in DNA causing its removal.  Yet another glycosylase recognizes a thymine to guanine pairing, a common occurrence due to the deamination of 5-methyl cytosine, and removes the thymine to allow for its replacement with cytosine.  There is also an alkyladenine DNA glycosylase that recognizes the mutated 3-methyl adenine, 7-methyl guanine, and hypoxanthine.\nDNA glycosylases remove DNA bases that are cytotoxic or cause DNA polymerase errors and are part of the base excision repair pathway for DNA. DNA glycosylases cleave the N-glycosydic bond between the target base and deoxyribose. Excision of the damaged base leaves behind an apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site in DNA which cannot be copied by DNA polymerases. Several DNA glycosylases are bifunctional; i.e. they also display a lyase activity responsible for cleaving the phosphodiester backbone 3´ to the AP site generated by the glycosylase activity.  They are called DNA glycosylase/AP lyases.  Base excision repair pathway is initiated by a DNA glycosylase with the recognition of either a specific type of damaged DNA structure or an inappropriate base, such as uracil. The resulting one nucleotide gap is filled by a DNA polymerase and repair is completed by a DNA ligase that seals the remaining nick. Human cells are known to contain following DNA glycosylases:\nUracil DNA glycosylases: Uracil can arise in DNA either by spontaneous deamination of cytosine or by the misincorporation of dU opposite to a dA by a DNA polymerase during DNA synthesis. At least four different uracil-DNA glycosylase activities have been identified in mammalian cells, removing uracil and generating an abasic site. These enzymes are UNG, SMUG1, TDG and MBD4 and they vary in substrate specificity and localization in the cell. SMUG1 prefers single-stranded DNA as substrate, but also removes U from double-stranded DNA. TDG and MBD4 are strictly specific for ds DNA.\nCurrent evidence suggests that UDG and SMUG1 are the major enzymes responsible for the repair of the U:G mispairs caused by spontaneous cytosine deamination, whereas uracil arising in DNA through dU misincorporation is mainly dealt with by UNG. In contrast, MBD4 appear to have a more specialized function in correcting T:G mismatches that arise from deamination of 5-methylC to thymine in CpG sites.\nThe structure of human UDG in complex with DNA revealed that it binds uracil by flipping the target nucleotide out of the double helix and into the active-site pocket.  UDG undergoes conformational change from an ‘‘open’’ unbound state to a ‘‘closed’’ DNA-bound state.\nMBD4 (methyl binding domain 4 protein) is a DNA glycosylase that removes thymine from T:G pairs at methyl-CpG sites. It is within the HhH-GPD superfamily. Mbd4 was identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen due to its interaction with the human mismatch repair protein MLH1. The mechanism for  recognition of thymine, a normal base in DNA, is based on a specific combination of hydrogen bonds and van der Waals forces.  MBD4 mutant mice develop normally and do not show increased cancer susceptibility or reduced survival. But they acquire more C T mutations at CpG sequences in epithelial cells of the small intestine.\nSMUG1 (single-strand selective monofunctional uracil-DNA glycosylase) is able to excise uracil from both single- and double-stranded  in both G:U and A:U base-pairs, but show no activity against G:T mismatches. Studies of UDG-knockout mice suggest that SMUG1 functions as a backup enzyme for UDG. SMUG1 also excises  5-hydroxyuracil, 5-hydroxymethyluracil and 5-formyluracil bearing an oxidized group at ring C5.\nTDG (thymine DNA glycosylase) repairs G:T mispair resulted form the  deamination of 5-methylcytosine\nReactive oxygen species (ROS) are a major source of endogenous DNA damage. The most abundant lesions formed in guanine residues are 2,6-diamino-4-hydroxy-5-formamidopyrimidine (FapyG) and 8-oxoguanine. Due to mispairing with adenine during replication, 8-oxoG is highly mutagenic, resulting in G to T transversions. Repair of this lesion is initiated by the bifunctional DNA glycosylase OGG1 that recognizes 8-oxoG paired with C.\nhOGG1 belong to the helix-hairpin-helix (HhH) family of DNA glycosylases. For the initial recognition of the damaged base, DNA is bent at the damage site followed by a flipping of the base into the active site pockets of the enzyme. Studies with OGG1 knockout in mice show no age-dependent accumulation of 8-oxoG in spleen, spermatocytes, or renal cells but accumulated in the liver. Also OGG1 null mice do not show an increased tumor incidence. The same is observed with the inactivation of MYH (Mut Y homolog DNA glycosylase) responsible for removing A opposite to 8-oxoG. But inactivation of both MYH and OGG1, accumulated 8-oxoG in the DNA of lung and small intestine. This is probably because mammalian cells contain three backup DNA glycosylases, NEIL1, NEIL2 and NEIL3.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Pulmonary fibrosis share the pathogenesis process of interstitial lung disease which involve the pulmonary parenchyma. Although the exact pathogenesis is not fully understood, there are many initiating factors which cause the pulmonary tissue injury. The main features of the lung injury includes inflammation, fibrosis, and granulomas development. Common causes of pulmonary fibrosis include autoimmunity, rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, tuberculosis, SLE, sarcoidosis, and polymyositis. Other causes of pulmonary fibrosis include environmental factors as cigarette smoking and dust exposure. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis must be differentiated from other causes of interstitial lung diseases which may cause fibrosis as well. Prevalence of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ranges from a low of 0.5 per 100.000 persons to a high of 27.9 per 100.000. Incidence of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ranges from a low of 3 per 100,000 persons to a high of 9 per 100,000 persons. Common risk factors of pulmonary fibrosis include cigarette smoking and genetic mutations which include hTERT, MUC5B, TERT, and RTEL1. Other risk factors include GERD and wood dust. If left untreated, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis will lead to complete respiratory failure and death. Common complications of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis include pulmonary hypertension, lung cancer, and cardiovascular comorbidities. The prognosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is usually poor with a survival rate from 2 to 5 years. Common symptoms of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis include Dyspnea, cough, Clubbing, Crackles, and arthralgia. Physical examination of patients with occupational lung disease is usually remarkable for bronchial breathing, increased vocal resonance, and fine crepitations. On chest CT scan, Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is characterized by honeycombing appearance of the lungs, bronchiectasis, ground glass opacities, and distortion of the lung opacities. The mainstay of the therapy is supportive care measures as mechanical ventilation. Lung transplantation is essential in treatment of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Pulmonary fibrosis is the most common interstitial lung disease requiring lung transplant and it should be performed early in order to increase the survival rate.\n\n【2】 #Historical Perspective\nPulmonary fibrosis was first described by Dr. Von Buhl in 1872.

Incidence of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ranges from a low of 3 per 100,000 persons to a high of 9 per 100,000 persons. The prevalence of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis increases with age. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is more prevalent in men more than women.\n\n【8】 #Risk Factors\nCommon risk factors of pulmonary fibrosis include cigarette smoking and genetic mutations which include hTERT, MUC5B, TERT, and RTEL1. Other risk factors include GERD and wood dust.\n\n【9】 #Screening\nThere is insufficient evidence to recommend routine screening for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.\n\n【10】 #Natural History, Complications, and Prognosis\nIf left untreated, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis will lead to complete respiratory failure and death. Common complications of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis include pulmonary hypertension, lung cancer, and cardiovascular comorbidities. The prognosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is usually poor with a survival rate from 2 to 5 years.\n\n【11】 ## Diagnostic Study of Choice\nThe diagnostic criteria for IPF includes major criteria and minor criteria. The major criteria must include exclusion of other causes of interstitial lung disease, pulmonary function tests that is evident of lung fibrosis, bibasilar reticular abnormalities in CT lung, and lung biopsy shows fibrosis. The minor criteria should include 3 of 4 criterion as age > 50, duration of illness more than 3 months, bibasilar inspiratory crackles, and insidious onset of exertional dyspnea.\n\n【12】 ## History and Symptoms\nCommon symptoms of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis include Dyspnea, cough, Clubbing, Crackles, and arthralgia. Less common symptoms include Hamman-Rich Syndrome.\n\n【13】 ## Physical Examination\nPatients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis usually appear fatigued and short of breath. Physical examination of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is usually remarkable for bronchial breathing, increased vocal resonance, and fine crepitations.\n\n【14】 ## Laboratory Findings\nThere are no diagnostic laboratory findings associated with pulmonary fibrosis. However, useful laboratory findings consistent with the diagnosis of pulmonary fibrosis include abnormal arterial blood gases, sputum analysis, and blood picture.\n\n【15】 ## X-ray\nX ray imaging does not show specific features for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. However, patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis have imaging abnormalities from the beginning of the disease course.\n\n【16】 ## CT scan\nOn chest CT scan, Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is characterized by honeycombing appearance of the lungs, bronchiectasis, ground glass opacities, and distortion of the lung opacities.\n\n【17】 ## MRI\nThere are no MRI findings associated with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.\n\n【18】 ## Other Imaging Findings\nThere are no other imaging findings associated with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.\n\n【19】 ## Other Diagnostic Studies\nOther diagnsotic findings consistent with diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis include reduced lung volumes and decreased diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide. Both are performed via spirometry.\n\n【20】 ## Medical Therapy\nThe mainstay of therapy for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is the supportive care measures which include mechanical ventilation, pulmonary rehabilitation, and vaccination against influenza and pneumococcus. Medical treatment as nintedanib and pirfenidone can be administrated to slow the disease progression.\n\n【21】 ## Surgery\nLung transplantation is essential in treatment of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Pulmonary fibrosis is the most common interstitial lung disease requiring lung transplant and it should be performed early in order to increase the survival rate.\n\n【22】 ## Primary Prevention\nThe primary prevention of pulmonary fibrosis or usual interstitial pneumonia includes smoking cessation and vaccination against influenza.\n\n【23】 ## Secondary Prevention\nThe primary and secondary prevention strategies for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis are the same.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Clinical studies have not been conducted in the pediatric population.\n\n【9】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Estradiol patch in pediatric patients.\n\n【10】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Estradiol patch in pediatric patients.\n\n【11】 #Contraindications\nClimara is contraindicated in women with any of the following conditions:\n- Undiagnosed abnormal genital bleeding\n- Known, suspected, or history of breast cancer\n- Active DVT, PE, or a history of these conditions\n- Active arterial thromboembolic disease (for example, stroke and MI), or a history of these conditions\n- Known anaphylactic reaction or angioedema with Climara - Known protein C, protein S, or antithrombin deficiency, or other known thrombophilic disorders\n\n【12】 Cardiovascular Disorders\n- An increased risk of stroke and DVT has been reported with estrogen-alone therapy. An increased risk of PE, DVT, stroke and MI has been reported with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Should any of these occur or be suspected, estrogen with or without progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately.\n- Risk factors for arterial vascular disease (for example, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, tobacco use, hypercholesterolemia, and obesity) and/or venous thromboembolism (VTE) (for example, personal history or family history of VTE, obesity, and systemic lupus erythematosus) should be managed appropriately.\nStroke\n- In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, a statistically significant increased risk of stroke was reported in women 50 to 79 years of age receiving daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone compared to women in the same age group receiving placebo (45 versus 33 per 10,000 women-years). The increase in risk was demonstrated in year 1 and persisted. Should a stroke occur or be suspected, estrogen-alone therapy should be discontinued immediately.\nSubgroup analyses of women 50 to 59 years of age suggest no increased risk of stroke for those women receiving CE (0.625 mg)-alone versus those receiving placebo (18 versus 21 per 10,000 women-years).1\nCoronary Heart Disease\n- In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, no overall effect on coronary heart disease (CHD) events (defined as nonfatal MI, silent MI, or CHD death) was reported in women receiving estrogen-alone compared to placebo2.\n- Subgroup analyses of women 50 to 59 years of age suggest a statistically non-significant reduction in CHD events (CE -alone compared to placebo) in women with less than 10 years since menopause (8 versus 16 per 10,000 women-years).1\n- In postmenopausal women with documented heart disease (n = 2,763), average 66.7 years of age, in a controlled clinical trial of secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study ), treatment with daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) demonstrated no cardiovascular benefit. During an average follow-up of 4.1 years, treatment with CE plus MPA did not reduce the overall rate of CHD events in postmenopausal women with established coronary heart disease. There were more CHD events in the CE plus MPA-treated group than in the placebo group in year 1, but not during the subsequent years. A total of 2,321 women from the original HERS trial agreed to participate in an open label extension of HERS, HERS II. Average follow-up in HERS II was an additional 2.7 years, for a total of 6.8 years overall. Rates of CHD events were comparable among women in the CE plus MPA group and the placebo group in HERS, HERS II, and overall.\nVenous Thromboembolism\nMalignant Neoplasms\nEndometrial Cancer:\n- An increased risk of endometrial cancer has been reported with the use of unopposed estrogen therapy in a woman with a uterus. The reported endometrial cancer risk among unopposed estrogen users is about 2 to 12 times greater than in non-users, and appears dependent on duration of treatment and on estrogen dose. Most studies show no significant increased risk associated with use of estrogens for less than 1 year. The greatest risk appears associated with prolonged use, with increased risks of 15- to 24-fold for 5 to 10 years or more. This risk has been shown to persist for at least 8 to 15 years after estrogen therapy is discontinued.\n- Clinical surveillance of all women using estrogen-alone or estrogen plus progestin therapy is important. Adequate diagnostic measures, including directed or random endometrial sampling when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in postmenopausal women with undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal genital bleeding.\nBreast Cancer\n- The most important randomized clinical trial providing information about breast cancer in estrogen-alone users is the WHI substudy of daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone. In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, after an average follow-up of 7.1 years, daily CE-alone was not associated with an increased risk of invasive breast cancer (relative risk (RR) 0.80)5.\n- The use of estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin has been reported to result in an increase in abnormal mammograms requiring further evaluation.\n- All women should receive yearly breast examinations by a healthcare provider and perform monthly breast self-examinations. In addition, mammography examinations should be scheduled based on patient age, risk factors, and prior mammogram results.\nOvarian Cancer:\nProbable Dementia - After an average follow-up of 5.2 years, 28 women in the estrogen-alone group and 19 women in the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia. The relative risk of probable dementia for CE-alone versus placebo was 1.49 (95 percent CI, 0.83-2.66). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE-alone versus placebo was 37 versus 25 cases per 10,000 women-years8.\n- When data from the two populations in the WHIMS estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin ancillary studies were pooled as planned in the WHIMS protocol, the reported overall relative risk for probable dementia was 1.76 (95 percent CI, 1.19-2.60). Since both ancillary studies were conducted in women 65 to 79 years of age, it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women8.\nGallbladder Disease\nHypercalcemia\nVisual Abnormalities\nAddition of a Progestin When a Woman Has Not Had a Hysterectomy\nElevated Blood Pressure\n- In women with pre-existing hypertriglyceridemia, estrogen therapy may be associated with elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis. Consider discontinuation of treatment if pancreatitis occurs.\nHepatic Impairment and/or Past History of Cholestatic Jaundice\n- Estrogens may be poorly metabolized in women with impaired liver function. For women with a history of cholestatic jaundice associated with past estrogen use or with pregnancy, caution should be exercised, and in the case of recurrence, medication should be discontinued.\nHypothyroidism\n- Estrogen administration leads to increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) levels. Women with normal thyroid function can compensate for the increased TBG by making more thyroid hormone, thus maintaining free T4 and T3 serum concentrations in the normal range. Women dependent on thyroid hormone replacement therapy who are also receiving estrogens may require increased doses of their thyroid replacement therapy. These women should have their thyroid function monitored in order to maintain their free thyroid hormone levels in an acceptable range.\nFluid Retention\n- Estrogen therapy should be used with caution in women with hypoparathyroidism as estrogen-induced hypocalcemia may occur.\nExacerbation of Endometriosis\nHereditary Angioedema - Exogenous estrogens may exacerbate symptoms of angioedema in women with hereditary angioedema.\nLaboratory Tests\n- Serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol levels have not been shown to be useful in the management of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms and moderate to severe symptoms of vulvar and vaginal atrophy.\nDrug-Laboratory Test Interactions\n- Accelerated prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and platelet aggregation time; increased platelet count; increased factors II, VII antigen, VIII antigen, VIII coagulant activity, IX, X, XII, VII-X complex, II-VII-X complex, and beta-thromboglobulin; decreased levels of antifactor Xa and antithrombin III, decreased antithrombin III activity; increased levels of fibrinogen and fibrinogen activity; increased plasminogen antigen and activity.\n- Other binding proteins may be elevated in serum, for example, corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), leading to increased total circulating corticosteroids and sex steroids, respectively. Free hormone concentrations, such as testosterone and estradiol, may be decreased. Other plasma proteins may be increased (angiotensinogen/renin substrate, alpha-l-antitrypsin, ceruloplasmin).\n- Impaired glucose tolerance.\n\n【13】 ## Clinical Trials Experience\n- Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.\n- The data described below reflect pooled data from 5 clinical trials of Climara. A total of 614 women were exposed to Climara for 3 months (193 women at 0.025 mg per day, 201 women at 0.05 mg per day, 194 women at 0.1 mg per day) in randomized, double-blind trials of clinical efficacy versus placebo and versus active comparator. All women were postmenopausal, had a serum estradiol level of less than 20 pg/mL, and a minimum of five moderate to severe hot flushes per week or a minimum of 15 hot flushes per week of any severity at baseline025 mg per day for 6 to 24 months (N=16 at 24 months) in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of Climara for the prevention of osteoporosis.\n\n【14】 ## Postmarketing Experience\nThe following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of the Climara transdermal system. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.\n- Genitourinary System:\n- Changes in bleeding pattern, pelvic pain\n- Breast:\n- Breast cancer, breast pain, breast tenderness\n- Cardiovascular:\n- Gastrointestinal:\n- Vomiting, abdominal pain, abdominal distension, nausea - Skin:\n- Alopecia, hyperhidrosis, night sweats, urticaria, rash\n- Visual disturbances, contact lens intolerance, - Central Nervous System:\n- Depression, migraine, paresthesia, dizziness, anxiety, irritability, mood swings, nervousness, insomnia, headache\n- Miscellaneous:\n- Fatigue, menopausal symptoms, weight increase, application site reaction, anaphylactic reactions\n\n【15】 #Drug Interactions\nMetabolic Interactions\n- In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that estrogens are metabolized partially by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Therefore, inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4 may affect estrogen drug metabolism. Inducers of CYP3A4 such as St. John’s wort (hypericum perforatum) preparations, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, and rifampin may reduce plasma concentrations of estrogens, possibly resulting in a decrease in therapeutic effects and/or changes in the uterine bleeding profile. Inhibitors of CYP3A4 such as erythromycin, clarithromycin, ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir and grapefruit juice may increase plasma concentrations of estrogens and may result in side effects.\n\n【16】 ### Pregnancy\nPregnancy Category (FDA):\n- Climara should not be used during pregnancy. There appears to be little or no increased risk of birth defects in children born to women who have used estrogens and progestins as oral contraceptives inadvertently during early pregnancy.\nThere is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Estradiol (transdermal) in women who are pregnant.\n\n【17】 ### Labor and Delivery\nThere is no FDA guidance on use of Estradiol (transdermal) during labor and delivery.\n\n【18】 ### Nursing Mothers\n- Climara should not be used during lactation. Estrogen administration to nursing women has been shown to decrease the quantity and quality of the breast milk. Detectable amounts of estrogens have been identified in the breast milk of women receiving estrogen therapy. Caution should be exercised when the Climara transdermal system is administered to a nursing woman.\n\n【19】 ### Pediatric Use\n- Climara is not indicated in children. Clinical studies have not been conducted in the pediatric population.\n\n【20】 ### Geriatic Use\n- There have not been sufficient numbers of geriatric women involved in clinical studies utilizing Climara to determine whether those over 65 years of age differ from younger subjects in their response to Climara.\nThe Women’s Health Initiative Studies\n- In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy (daily CE -alone versus placebo), there was a higher relative risk of stroke in women greater than 65 years of age.\n- Since both ancillary studies were conducted in women 65 to 79 years of age, it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women8.\n\n【21】 ### Gender\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Estradiol (transdermal) with respect to specific gender populations.\n\n【22】 ### Race\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Estradiol (transdermal) with respect to specific racial populations.\n\n【23】 ### Renal Impairment\n- In postmenopausal women with end stage renal disease (ESRD) receiving maintenance hemodialysis, total estradiol serum levels are higher than in normal subjects at baseline and following oral doses of estradiol. Therefore, conventional transdermal estradiol doses used in individuals with normal renal function may be excessive for postmenopausal women with ESRD receiving maintenance hemodialysis.\n\n【24】 ### Hepatic Impairment\n- Estrogens may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function and should be administered with caution.\n\n【25】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Estradiol (transdermal) in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n\n【26】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\nThere is no FDA guidance one the use of Estradiol (transdermal) in patients who are immunocompromised.\n\n【27】 ### Administration\nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\n- Generally, when estrogen is prescribed for a postmenopausal woman with a uterus, a progestin should also be considered to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. A woman without a uterus does not need a progestin. In some cases, however, hysterectomized women with a history of endometriosis may need a progestin.\nTreatment of Moderate to Severe Vasomotor Symptoms due to Menopause\n- Start therapy with 0.025 mg per day applied to the skin once weekly. Therapy should be started at the lowest effective dose and the shortest duration consistent with the treatment goals. Attempts to taper or discontinue the medication should be made at 3 to 6 month intervals.\nPrevention of Postmenopausal Osteoporosis\nApplication of the Climara Transdermal System\nSite Selection:\n- The adhesive side of Climara should be placed on a clean, dry area of the lower abdomen or the upper quadrant of the buttock.\n- Climara should not be applied to or near the breasts.\n- Application to areas where sitting would dislodge Climara should also be avoided.\n- Climara should be pressed firmly in place with the fingers for at least 10 seconds, making sure there is good contact, especially around the edges.\n- If the system lifts, apply pressure to maintain adhesion.\n- In the event that a system should fall off reapply it to a different location. If the system cannot be reapplied, a new system should be applied for the remainder of the 7-day dosing interval.\n- Only one system should be worn at any one time during the 7-day dosing interval.\n- Swimming, bathing, or using a sauna while using Climara has not been studied, and these activities may decrease the adhesion of the system and the delivery of estradiol.\nRemoval of the Climara Transdermal System\n- Removal of Climara should be done carefully and slowly to avoid irritation of the skin.\n- Used patches still contain some active hormones. Each patch should be carefully folded in half so that it sticks to itself before throwing it away.\n- Climara (estradiol transdermal system), 0.025 mg per day—each 6.5 cm2 system contains 2 mg of estradiol\n\n【28】 ### Monitoring\n- Women dependent on thyroid hormone replacement therapy who are also receiving estrogens may require increased doses of their thyroid replacement therapy. These women should have their thyroid function monitored in order to maintain their free thyroid hormone levels in an acceptable range.\n\n【29】 #IV Compatibility\nThere is limited information regarding the compatibility of Estradiol (transdermal) and IV administrations.\n\n【30】 #Overdosage\n- Overdosage of estrogen may cause nausea, vomiting, breast tenderness, abdominal pain, drowsiness and fatigue, and withdrawal bleeding in women. Treatment of overdose consists of discontinuation of Climara therapy with institution of appropriate symptomatic care.\n\n【31】 ## Mechanism of Action\n- Endogenous estrogens are largely responsible for the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system and secondary sexual characteristics. Although circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions, estradiol is the principal intracellular human estrogen and is substantially more potent than its metabolites, estrone and estriol at the receptor level.\n- Estrogens act through binding to nuclear receptors in estrogen-responsive tissues. To date, two estrogen receptors have been identified. These vary in proportion from tissue to tissue.\n- Circulating estrogens modulate the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and FSH, through a negative feedback mechanism. Estrogens act to reduce the elevated levels of these hormones seen in postmenopausal women.\n\n【32】 ## Structure\n- Climara (estradiol transdermal system), is designed to release estradiol continuously upon application to intact skin. Six (6.5, 9.375, 12.5, 15, 18.75 and 25 cm2) systems are available to provide nominal in vivo delivery of 0.025, 0.0375, 0.05, 0.06, 0.075 or 0.1 mg respectively of estradiol per day. The period of use is 7 days. Each system has a contact surface area of either 6.5, 9.375, 12.5, 15, 18.75 or 25 cm2, and contains 2, 2.85, 3.8, 4.55, 5.7 or 7.6 mg of estradiol USP respectively. The composition of the systems per unit area is identical.\n- Estradiol USP is a white, crystalline powder, chemically described as estra-1,3,5-triene-3, 17β-diol. It has an empirical formula of C18 H24 O2 and molecular weight of 272.38. The structural formula is:\n- The Climara transdermal system comprises three layers. Proceeding from the visible surface toward the surface attached to the skin, these layers are:\n- A translucent polyethylene film.\n- An acrylate adhesive matrix containing estradiol USP.\n- A protective liner of siliconized or fluoropolymer-coated polyester film is attached to the adhesive surface and must be removed before the system can be used.\n\n【33】 ## Pharmacodynamics\n- There are no pharmacodynamic data for Climara.\n\n【34】 ## Pharmacokinetics\nAbsorption\n- Transdermal administration of Climara produces mean serum concentrations of estradiol comparable to those produced by premenopausal women in the early follicular phase of the ovulatory cycle. The pharmacokinetics of estradiol following application of the Climara transdermal system were investigated in 197 healthy postmenopausal women in six studies. In five of the studies, the Climara transdermal system was applied to the abdomen, and in a sixth study, application to the buttocks and abdomen were compared.\n- In a bioavailability study, the Climara 6.5 cm2 was studied with the Climara 12.\n- Dose proportionality was demonstrated for the Climara 6.5 cm2 transdermal system as compared to the Climara 12.5 cm2 transdermal system in a 2-week crossover study with a 1-week washout period between the two-transdermal systems in 24 postmenopausal women.\n- In a 3-week multiple application study in 24 postmenopausal women, the 25 cm2 Climara transdermal system produced average peak estradiol concentrations (Cmax) of approximately 100 pg/mL. Trough values at the end of each wear interval (Cmin) were approximately 35 pg/mL. Nearly identical serum curves were seen each week, indicating little or no accumulation of estradiol in the body. Serum estrone peak and trough levels were 60 and 40 pg/mL, respectively.\nDistribution\n- The distribution of exogenous estrogens is similar to that of endogenous estrogens. Estrogens are widely distributed in the body and are generally found in higher concentrations in the sex hormone target organs. Estrogens circulate in the blood largely bound to SHBG and albumin.\nMetabolism\n- Exogenous estrogens are metabolized in the same manner as endogenous estrogens. Circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions. These transformations take place mainly in the liver. Estradiol is converted reversibly to estrone, and both can be converted to estriol, which is a major urinary metabolite. Estrogens also undergo enterohepatic recirculation via sulfate and glucuronide conjugation in the liver, biliary secretion of conjugates into the intestine, and hydrolysis in the intestine followed by reabsorption. In postmenopausal women, a significant proportion of the circulating estrogens exist as sulfate conjugates, especially estrone sulfate, which serves as a circulating reservoir for the formation of more active estrogens.\nExcretion\n- Estradiol, estrone, and estriol are excreted in the urine along with glucuronide and sulfate conjugates.\nAdhesion\n- The adhesion assessment was done visually on Days 2, 4, 5, 6, 7 of each week of transdermal system wear. A total of 1,654 adhesion observations were conducted for 333 transdermal systems of each size.\n- Of these observations, approximately 90 percent showed essentially no lift for both the 6.5 cm2 and 12.5 cm2 transdermal systems. Of the total number of transdermal systems applied, approximately 5 percent showed complete detachment for each size. Adhesion potentials of the 18.75 cm2 and 25 cm2 sizes of transdermal systems (0.075 mg per day and 0.1 mg per day) have not been studied.\n\n【35】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\nCarcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\n- Long-term continuous administration of natural and synthetic estrogens in certain animal species increases the frequency of carcinomas of the breast, uterus, cervix, vagina, testis, and liver.\n\n【36】 #Clinical Studies\nEffects on Vasomotor Symptoms\n- A study of 214 women 25 to 74 years of age met the qualification criteria and were randomly assigned to one of the three treatment groups: 72 to the 0.05 mg estradiol patch, 70 to the 0.1 mg estradiol patch, and 72 to placebo. Potential subjects were postmenopausal women in good general health who experienced vasomotor symptoms. Natural menopause patients had not menstruated for at least 12 months and surgical menopause patients had undergone bilateral oophorectomy at least 4 weeks before evaluation for study entry. In order to enter the 11-week treatment phase of the study, potential subjects must have experienced a minimum of five moderate to severe hot flushes per week, or a minimum of 15 hot flushes of any severity per week, for 2 consecutive weeks. Women wore the patches in a cyclical fashion (three weeks on and one week off).\n- During treatment, all subjects used diaries to record the number and severity of hot flushes. Subjects were monitored by clinic visits at the end of weeks 1, 3, 7, and 11 and by telephone at the end of weeks 4, 5, 8, and 9.\n- In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study of 187 women receiving Climara 0.025 mg per day or placebo continuously for up to three 28-day cycles, the Climara 0.025 mg per day dosage was shown to be statistically better than placebo at weeks 4 and 12 for relief of both the frequency and severity of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms.\n\n【37】 Vasomotor Symptoms Intent to Treat (ITT)\nEffects on Bone Mineral Density\n\n【38】 Percent change in BMD of the total hip  was also statistically significantly different from placebo for all active treatment groups\nWomen's Health Initiative Studies\n- The WHI enrolled approximately 27,000 predominantly healthy postmenopausal women in two substudies to assess the risks and benefits of daily oral CE (0.625 mg)-alone or in combination with MPA (2.5 mg) compared to placebo in the prevention of certain chronic diseases. The primary endpoint was the incidence of CHD (defined as nonfatal MI, silent MI and CHD death), with invasive breast cancer as the primary adverse outcome. A \"global index\" included the earliest occurrence of CHD, invasive breast cancer, stroke, PE, endometrial cancer (only in the CE plus MPA substudy), colorectal cancer, hip fracture, or death due to other causes. These substudies did not evaluate the effects of CE-alone or CE plus MPA on menopausal symptoms.\nWHI Estrogen-Alone Substudy\n- The WHI estrogen-alone substudy was stopped early because an increased risk of stroke was observed, and it was deemed that no further information would be obtained regarding the risk and benefits of estrogen-alone in predetermined primary endpoints.\n- Results of the estrogen-alone substudy, which included 10,739 women (average 63 years of age, range 50 to 79: 75.3 percent White, 15.1 percent Black, 6.1 percent Hispanic, 3.6 percent Other) after an average follow-up of 7\n- For those outcomes included in the WHI \"global index\" that reached statistical significance, the absolute excess risks per 10,000 women-years in the group treated with CE-alone was 12 more strokes, while the absolute risk reduction per 10,000 women-years was 7 fewer hip fractures.9 The absolute excess risk of events included in the \"global index\" was a non-significant 5 events per 10,000 women-years. There was no difference between the groups in terms of all-cause mortality.\n- No overall difference for primary CHD events (nonfatal MI, silent MI and CHD death) and invasive breast cancer incidence in women receiving CE-alone compared with placebo was reported in final centrally adjudicated results from the estrogen-alone substudy, after an average follow-up of 7.1 years\n- The WHIMS estrogen-alone ancillary study of WHI enrolled 2,947 predominantly healthy hysterectomized postmenopausal women 65 to 79 years of age (45 percent were 65 to 69 years of age; 36 percent were 70 to 74 years of age; 19 percent were 75 years of age and older) to evaluate the effects of daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone on the incidence of probable dementia (primary outcome) compared to placebo.\n- When data from the two populations were pooled as planned in the WHIMS protocol, the reported overall relative risk for probable dementia was 1.76 (95 percent CI, 1.19-2.60). Differences between groups became apparent in the first year of treatment. It is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women.\n\n【39】 #How Supplied\n- Climara (estradiol transdermal system), 0.025 mg per day — each 6.5 cm2 system contains 2 mg of estradiol USP\n\n【40】 ## Storage\n- Store at 20°C to 25°C (66°F to 77°F); excursions permitted between 15°C and 30°C (59°F and 86°F).

{"seq_id": "d15f9468-b7bb-4814-a83d-a31b54df9869", "title": null, "text": "【0】 Risperidone (injection)\n\n【1】 #Overview\nRisperidone (injection) is an atypical antipsychotic that is FDA approved for the treatment of schizophrenia. Common adverse reactions include headache, parkinsonism, dizziness, akathisia, fatigue, constipation, dyspepsia, sedation, weight increased, pain in extremity, and dry mouth.\n\n【2】 ### Bipolar Disorder\n- Risperidone is indicated as monotherapy or as adjunctive therapy to lithium or valproate for the maintenance treatment of Bipolar I Disorder\n\n【3】 ## Dosage\n- For patients who have never taken oral risperidone, it is recommended to establish tolerability with oral risperidone prior to initiating treatment with Risperidone (injection).\n- Risperidone (injection) should be administered every 2 weeks by deep intramuscular (IM) deltoid or gluteal injection. Each injection should be administered by a health care professional using the appropriate enclosed safety needle. For deltoid administration, use the 1-inch needle alternating injections between the two arms. For gluteal administration, use the 2-inch needle alternating injections between the two buttocks. Do not administer intravenously.\n\n【4】 ### Bipolar Disorder\n- The recommended dose for monotherapy or adjunctive therapy to lithium or valproate for the maintenance treatment of Bipolar I Disorder is 25 mg IM every 2 weeks. Some patients may benefit from a higher dose of 37.5 mg or 50 mg. Dosages above 50 mg have not been studied in this population. The physician who elects to use risperidone (injection) for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term risks and benefits of the drug for the individual patient.\n\n【5】 ### General Dosing Information\n- A lower initial dose of 12.5 mg may be appropriate when clinical factors warrant dose adjustment, such as in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, for certain drug interactions that increase risperidone plasma concentrations or in patients who have a history of poor tolerability to psychotropic medications. The efficacy of the 12.5 mg dose has not been investigated in clinical trials.\n- Oral risperidone (or another antipsychotic medication) should be given with the first injection of risperidone (injection) and continued for 3 weeks (and then discontinued) to ensure that adequate therapeutic plasma concentrations are maintained prior to the main release phase of risperidone from the injection site.\n- Upward dose adjustment should not be made more frequently than every 4 weeks. The clinical effects of this dose adjustment should not be anticipated earlier than 3 weeks after the first injection with the higher dose.\n- Do not combine two different dose strengths of risperidone (injection) in a single administration.\n\n【6】 ### Dosage in Special Populations\n- Elderly\n- For elderly patients treated with risperidone (injection), the recommended dosage is 25 mg IM every 2 weeks. Oral risperidone (or another antipsychotic medication) should be given with the first injection of risperidone (injection) and should be continued for 3 weeks to ensure that adequate therapeutic plasma concentrations are maintained prior to the main release phase of risperidone from the injection site.\n- Renal or Hepatic Impairment\n- Patients with renal or hepatic impairment should be treated with titrated doses of oral risperidone prior to initiating treatment with risperidone (injection). The recommended starting dose is 0.5 mg oral risperidone twice daily during the first week, which can be increased to 1 mg twice daily or 2 mg once daily during the second week. If a total daily dose of at least 2 mg oral risperidone is well tolerated, an injection of 25 mg risperidone (injection) can be administered every 2 weeks. Oral supplementation should be continued for 3 weeks after the first injection until the main release of risperidone from the injection site has begun. In some patients, slower titration may be medically appropriate. Alternatively, a starting dose of risperidone (injection) of 12.5 mg may be appropriate. The efficacy of the 12.5 mg dose has not been investigated in clinical trials.\n\n【7】 ### Reinitiation of Treatment in Patients Previously Discontinued\n- There are no data to specifically address reinitiation of treatment. When restarting patients who have had an interval off treatment with risperidone (injection), supplementation with oral risperidone (or another antipsychotic medication) should be administered.\n\n【8】 ### Switching from Other Antipsychotics\n- There are no systematically collected data to specifically address switching patients from other antipsychotics to risperidone (injection), or concerning concomitant administration with other antipsychotics. Previous antipsychotics should be continued for 3 weeks after the first injection of risperidone (injection) to ensure that therapeutic concentrations are maintained until the main release phase of risperidone from the injection site has begun. For patients who have never taken oral risperidone, it is recommended to establish tolerability with oral risperidone prior to initiating treatment with risperidone (injection). As recommended with other antipsychotic medications, the need for continuing existing EPS medication should be re-evaluated periodically.\n\n【9】 ### Co-Administration of Risperidone (injection) with Certain Other Medications\n- Co-administration of carbamazepine and other CYP 3A4 enzyme inducers (e.g. phenytoin, rifampin, phenobarbital) with risperidone would be expected to cause decreases in the plasma concentrations of the sum of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone combined, which could lead to decreased efficacy of risperidone (injection) treatment. The dose of risperidone needs to be titrated accordingly for patients receiving these enzyme inducers, especially during initiation or discontinuation of therapy with these inducers. At the initiation of therapy with carbamazepine or other known CYP 3A4 hepatic enzyme inducers, patients should be closely monitored during the first 4–8 weeks, since the dose of risperidone (injection) may need to be adjusted. A dose increase, or additional oral risperidone, may need to be considered. On discontinuation of carbamazepine or other CYP 3A4 hepatic enzyme inducers, the dosage of risperidone (injection) should be re-evaluated and, if necessary, decreased. Patients may be placed on a lower dose of risperidone (injection) between 2 to 4 weeks before the planned discontinuation of carbamazepine or other CYP 3A4 inducers to adjust for the expected increase in plasma concentrations of risperidone plus 9-hydroxyrisperidone. For patients treated with the recommended dose of 25 mg risperidone (injection) and discontinuing from carbamazepine or other CYP3A4 enzyme inducers, it is recommended to continue treatment with the 25-mg dose unless clinical judgment necessitates lowering the risperidone (injection) dose to 12.5 mg or necessitates interruption of risperidone (injection) treatment. The efficacy of the 12.5 mg dose has not been investigated in clinical trials.\n\n【10】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\n- There is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Risperidone (injection) in adult patients.\n\n【11】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n- There is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Risperidone (injection) in adult patients.\n\n【12】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Pediatric)\n- Pediatric Use: safety and effectiveness not established in patients less than 18 years of age.\n\n【13】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\n- There is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Risperidone (injection) in pediatric patients.\n\n【14】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n- There is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Risperidone (injection) in pediatric patients.\n\n【15】 #Contraindications\n- Risperidone (injection) is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to the product.\n\n【16】 ## Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)\n- A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with antipsychotic drugs. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure.\n- The management of NMS should include:  immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy;  intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring; and  treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for uncomplicated NMS.\n- If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. The patient should be carefully monitored, since recurrences of NMS have been reported.\n\n【17】 ## Tardive Dyskinesia - A syndrome of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs. Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic treatment, which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown.\n- The risk of developing tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient increase. However, the syndrome can develop, although much less commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses.\n- Given these considerations, risperidone (injection) should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients who suffer from a chronic illness that:  is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs, and  for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. The need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically.\n- If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient treated with risperidone (injection), drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment with risperidone (injection) despite the presence of the syndrome.\n\n【18】 ## Metabolic Changes\n- Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with metabolic changes that may increase cardiovascular/cerebrovascular risk. These metabolic changes include hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and body weight gain. While all of the drugs in the class have been shown to produce some metabolic changes, each drug has its own specific risk profile.\n\n【19】 ### Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus\n- Hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, have been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics including risperidone. Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. Given these confounders, the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and hyperglycemia-related adverse events is not completely understood. However, epidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of treatment-emergent hyperglycemia-related adverse events in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycemia-related adverse events in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics are not available.\n\n【20】 - In longer-term, controlled and uncontrolled studies in adult subjects, risperidone was associated with a mean change in glucose of +2.8 mg/dL at Week 24 (n=151) and +4.1 mg/dL at Week 48 (n=50).\n\n【21】 ### Dyslipidemia - Undesirable alterations in lipids have been observed in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics.\n\n【22】 - In longer-term, controlled and uncontrolled studies, risperidone was associated with a mean change in (a) non-fasting cholesterol of +4.4 mg/dL at Week 24 (n=231) and +5.5 mg/dL at Week 48 (n=86); and (b) non-fasting triglycerides of +19.9 mg/dL at Week 24 (n=52).\n\n【23】 ### Weight Gain\n- Weight gain has been observed with atypical antipsychotic use. Clinical monitoring of weight is recommended.\n\n【24】 - In an uncontrolled, longer-term, open-label study, risperidone (injection) was associated with a mean change in weight of +2.1 kg at Week 24 (n=268) and +2.8 kg at Week 50 (n=199).\n\n【25】 ## Hyperprolactinemia - As with other drugs that antagonize dopamine D2 receptors, risperidone elevates prolactin levels and the elevation persists during chronic administration. Risperidone is associated with higher levels of prolactin elevation than other antipsychotic agents.\n- Hyperprolactinemia may suppress hypothalamic GnRH, resulting in reduced pituitary gonadotropin secretion. This, in turn, may inhibit reproductive function by impairing gonadal steroidogenesis in both female and male patients. Galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported in patients receiving prolactin-elevating compounds. Long-standing hyperprolactinemia when associated with hypogonadism may lead to decreased bone density in both female and male subjects.\n- Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately one-third of human breast cancers are prolactin dependent in vitro, a factor of potential importance if the prescription of these drugs is contemplated in a patient with previously detected breast cancer. An increase in pituitary gland, mammary gland, and pancreatic islet cell neoplasia (mammary adenocarcinomas, pituitary and pancreatic adenomas) was observed in the risperidone carcinogenicity studies conducted in mice and rats. Neither clinical studies nor epidemiologic studies conducted to date have shown an association between chronic administration of this class of drugs and tumorigenesis in humans; the available evidence is considered too limited to be conclusive at this time.\n\n【26】 ## Orthostatic Hypotension\n- Risperidone (injection) may induce orthostatic hypotension associated with dizziness, tachycardia, and in some patients, syncope, especially during the initial dose-titration period with oral risperidone, probably reflecting its alpha-adrenergic antagonistic properties. Syncope was reported in 0.8% (12/1499 patients) of patients treated with risperidone (injection) in multiple-dose studies. Patients should be instructed in nonpharmacologic interventions that help to reduce the occurrence of orthostatic hypotension (e.g. sitting on the edge of the bed for several minutes before attempting to stand in the morning and slowly rising from a seated position).\n\n【27】 ## Leukopenia, Neutropenia, and Agranulocytosis - Class Effect: In clinical trial and/or postmarketing experience, events of leukopenia/neutropenia have been reported temporally related to antipsychotic agents, including risperidone (injection). Agranulocytosis has also been reported.\n- Possible risk factors for leukopenia/neutropenia include pre-existing low white blood cell count (WBC) and a history of drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia. Patients with a history of a clinically significant low WBC or a drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia should have their complete blood count (CBC) monitored frequently during the first few months of therapy and discontinuation of risperidone (injection) should be considered at the first sign of a clinically significant decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors.\n- Patients with clinically significant neutropenia should be carefully monitored for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treated promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count <1000/mm3) should discontinue risperidone (injection) and have their WBC followed until recovery.\n\n【28】 ## Potential for Cognitive and Motor Impairment\n- Somnolence was reported by 5% of patients treated with risperidone (injection) in multiple-dose trials. Since risperidone has the potential to impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that treatment with risperidone (injection) does not affect them adversely.\n\n【29】 ## Seizures\n- During premarketing testing, seizures occurred in 0.3% (5/1499 patients) of patients treated with risperidone (injection). Therefore, risperidone (injection) should be used cautiously in patients with a history of seizures.\n\n【30】 ## Priapism\n- Priapism has been reported during postmarketing surveillance. Severe priapism may require surgical intervention.\n\n【31】 ## Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP)\n- A single case of TTP was reported in a 28 year-old female patient receiving oral risperidone in a large, open premarketing experience (approximately 1300 patients). She experienced jaundice, fever, and bruising, but eventually recovered after receiving plasmapheresis. The relationship to risperidone therapy is unknown.\n\n【32】 ## Body Temperature Regulation\n- Disruption of body temperature regulation has been attributed to antipsychotic agents. Both hyperthermia and hypothermia have been reported in association with oral risperidone or risperidone (injection) use. Caution is advised when prescribing risperidone (injection) for patients who will be exposed to temperature extremes.\n\n【33】 ## Administration\n- Risperidone (injection) should be injected into the deltoid or gluteal muscle, and care must be taken to avoid inadvertent injection into a blood vessel.\n\n【34】 ## Antiemetic Effect\n- Risperidone has an antiemetic effect in animals; this effect may also occur in humans, and may mask signs and symptoms of overdosage with certain drugs or of conditions such as intestinal obstruction, Reye's syndrome, and brain tumor.\n\n【35】 ## Suicide\n- There is an increased risk of suicide attempt in patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, and close supervision of high-risk patients should accompany drug therapy. risperidone (injection) is to be administered by a health care professional; therefore, suicide due to an overdose is unlikely.\n\n【36】 ## Use in Patients with Concomitant Illness\n- Clinical experience with risperidone (injection) in patients with certain concomitant systemic illnesses is limited. Patients with Parkinson's Disease or Dementia with Lewy Bodies who receive antipsychotics, including risperidone (injection), are reported to have an increased sensitivity to antipsychotic medications. Manifestations of this increased sensitivity have been reported to include confusion, obtundation, postural instability with frequent falls, extrapyramidal symptoms, and clinical features consistent with the neuroleptic malignant syndrome.\n\n【37】 ## Osteodystrophy and Tumors in Animals\n- Risperidone (injection) produced osteodystrophy in male and female rats in a 1-year toxicity study and a 2-year carcinogenicity study at a dose of 40 mg/kg administered IM every 2 weeks.\n- Risperidone (injection) produced renal tubular tumors (adenoma, adenocarcinoma) and adrenomedullary pheochromocytomas in male rats in the 2-year carcinogenicity study at 40 mg/kg administered IM every 2 weeks. In addition, risperidone (injection) produced an increase in a marker of cellular proliferation in renal tissue in males in the 1-year toxicity study and in renal tumor-bearing males in the 2-year carcinogenicity study at 40 mg/kg administered IM every 2 weeks. (Cellular proliferation was not measured at the low dose or in females in either study.)\n- The effect dose for osteodystrophy and the tumor findings is 8 times the IM maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) (50 mg) on a mg/m2 basis and is associated with a plasma exposure (AUC) 2 times the expected plasma exposure (AUC) at the IM MRHD. The no-effect dose for these findings was 5 mg/kg (equal to the IM MRHD on a mg/m2 basis). Plasma exposure (AUC) at the no-effect dose was one third the expected plasma exposure (AUC) at the IM MRHD.\n- Neither the renal or adrenal tumors, nor osteodystrophy, were seen in studies of orally administered risperidone. Osteodystrophy was not observed in dogs at doses up to 14 times (based on AUC) the IM MRHD in a 1-year toxicity study.\n1 (Carcinogenicity, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility).\n- The relevance of these findings to human risk is unknown.\n\n【38】 ## Monitoring: Laboratory Tests\n- No specific laboratory tests are recommended.\n\n【39】 ## Controlled Substance\n- Risperidone (injection) is not a controlled substance.\n\n【40】 ## Abuse\n- Risperidone (injection) has not been systematically studied in animals or humans for its potential for abuse. Because risperidone (injection) is to be administered by health care professionals, the potential for misuse or abuse by patients is low.\n\n【41】 ## Dependence\n- Risperidone (injection) has not been systematically studied in animals or humans for its potential for tolerance or physical dependence.\n\n【42】 ## Clinical Trials Experience\n- The most common adverse reactions in clinical trials in patients with schizophrenia (≥5%) were: headache, parkinsonism, dizziness, akathisia, fatigue, constipation, dyspepsia, sedation, weight increased, pain in extremity, and dry mouth. The most common adverse reactions in the double-blind, placebo-controlled periods of the bipolar disorder trials were weight increased (5% in the monotherapy trial) and tremor and parkinsonism (≥10% in the adjunctive treatment trial).\nOf these 2392 patients, 332 were patients who received risperidone (injection) while participating in a 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Two hundred two  of the 332 were schizophrenia patients who received 25 mg or 50 mg risperidone (injection). The conditions and duration of treatment with risperidone (injection) in the other clinical trials varied greatly and included (in overlapping categories) double-blind, fixed- and flexible-dose, placebo- or active-controlled studies and open-label phases of studies, inpatients and outpatients, and short-term (up to 12 weeks) and longer-term (up to 4 years) exposures. Safety was assessed by collecting adverse events and performing physical examinations, vital signs, body weights, laboratory analyses, and ECGs.\n- In addition to the studies in patients with schizophrenia, safety data are presented from a trial assessing the efficacy and safety of risperidone (injection) when administered as monotherapy for maintenance treatment in patients with bipolar I disorder. The subjects in this multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled study were adult patients who met DSM-IV criteria for Bipolar Disorder Type I and who were stable on risperidone (oral or long-acting injection), were stable on other antipsychotics or mood stabilizers, or were experiencing an acute episode. After a 3-week period of treatment with open-label oral risperidone (n=440), subjects who demonstrated an initial response to oral risperidone in this period and those who were stable on risperidone (oral or long-acting injection) at study entry entered into a 26-week stabilization period of open-label risperidone (injection) (n=501). Subjects who demonstrated a maintained response during this period were then randomized into a 24-month double-blind, placebo-controlled period in which they received risperidone (injection) (n=154) or placebo (n=149) as monotherapy. Subjects who relapsed or who completed the double-blind period could choose to enter an 8-week open-label risperidone (injection) extension period (n=160).\n- Adverse events during exposure to study treatment were obtained by general inquiry and recorded by clinical investigators using their own terminology. Consequently, to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse events, events were grouped in standardized categories using MedDRA terminology.\n- The majority of all adverse reactions were mild to moderate in severity.\n\n【43】 ## Commonly-Observed Adverse Reactions in Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trials – Bipolar Disorder\n\n【44】 ## Other Adverse Reactions Observed During the Clinical Trial Evaluation of Risperidone\n- The following additional adverse reactions occurred in <2% of the risperidone (injection)-treated patients in the above schizophrenia double-blind, placebo-controlled trial dataset, in <2% of the risperidone (injection)-treated patients in the above double-blind, placebo-controlled period of the monotherapy bipolar disorder trial dataset, or in <4% of the risperidone (injection)-treated patients in the above double-blind, placebo-controlled period of the adjunctive treatment bipolar disorder trial dataset. The following also includes additional adverse reactions reported at any frequency in risperidone (injection)-treated patients who participated in the open-label phases of the above bipolar disorder studies and in other studies, including double-blind, active controlled and open-label studies in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.\n- Blood and lymphatic system disorders: anemia, neutropenia - Cardiac disorders: tachycardia, atrioventricular block first degree, palpitations, sinus bradycardia,  left bundle branch block, bradycardia, sinus tachycardia, bundle branch block right\n- Ear and labyrinth disorders: ear pain, vertigo\n- Eye disorders: conjunctivitis, visual acuity reduced\n- Gastrointestinal disorders: diarrhea, vomiting, upper abdominal pain, stomach discomfort, gastritis - General disorders and administration site conditions: injection site pain, chest discomfort, chest pain, influenza like illness, sluggishness, malaise, induration, injection site induration, injection site swelling, injection site reaction, face edema - Immune system disorders: hypersensitivity\n- Infections and infestations: nasopharyngitis, influenza, bronchitis, urinary tract infection, rhinitis, respiratory tract infection, ear infection, pneumonia, lower respiratory tract infection, pharyngitis, sinusitis, viral infection, infection, localized infection, cystitis, gastroenteritis, subcutaneous abscess\n- Injury and poisoning: fall, procedural pain\n- Investigations: blood prolactin increased, alanine aminotransferase increased, electrocardiogram abnormal, gamma-glutamyl transferase increased, blood glucose increased, hepatic enzyme increased, aspartate aminotransferase increased, electrocardiogram QT prolonged, glucose urine present\n- Metabolism and nutritional disorders: anorexia, hyperglycemia - Musculoskeletal, connective tissue and bone disorders: posture abnormal, myalgia, back pain, buttock pain, muscular weakness, neck pain, musculoskeletal chest pain\n- Nervous system disorders: coordination abnormal, dystonia, tardive dyskinesia, drooling, paresthesia, dizziness postural, convulsion, akinesia, hypokinesia, dysarthria - Psychiatric disorders: insomnia, agitation, anxiety, sleep disorder, depression, initial insomnia, libido decreased, nervousness\n- Renal and urinary disorders: urinary incontinence\n- Reproductive system and breast disorders: galactorrhea, oligomenorrhea, erectile dysfunction, sexual dysfunction, ejaculation disorder, gynecomastia, breast discomfort, menstruation irregular, menstruation delayed, menstrual disorder, ejaculation delayed\n- Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: nasal congestion, pharyngolaryngeal pain, dyspnea, rhinorrhea - Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: rash, eczema, pruritus generalized, pruritus\n- Vascular disorders: hypotension, orthostatic hypotension\n\n【45】 ### Bipolar Disorder\n- In the 24-month double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment period of the trial assessing the efficacy and safety of risperidone (injection) when administered as monotherapy for maintenance treatment in patients with bipolar I disorder, 1 (0.6%) of 154 risperidone (injection)-treated patients discontinued due to an adverse reaction (hyperglycemia).\n\n【46】 ### Extrapyramidal Symptoms:\n- Two methods were used to measure extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) in the 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled trial comparing three doses of risperidone (injection) (25 mg, 50 mg, and 75 mg) with placebo in patients with schizophrenia, including:  the incidence of spontaneous reports of EPS symptoms; and  the change from baseline to endpoint on the total score (sum of the subscale scores for parkinsonism, dystonia, and dyskinesia) of the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (ESRS).\n\n【47】 - The median change from baseline to endpoint in total ESRS score showed no worsening in patients treated with risperidone (injection) compared with patients treated with placebo: 0 (placebo group); -1 (25-mg group, significantly less than the placebo group); and 0 (50-mg group).\n\n【48】 ### Changes in ECG\n- The electrocardiograms of 202 schizophrenic patients treated with 25 mg or 50 mg risperidone (injection) and 98 schizophrenic patients treated with placebo in the 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled trial were evaluated. Compared with placebo, there were no statistically significant differences in QTc intervals (using Fridericia's and linear correction factors) during treatment with risperidone (injection).\n\n【49】 ## Pain Assessment and Local Injection Site Reactions\n- The mean intensity of injection pain reported by patients with schizophrenia using a visual analog scale (0 = no pain to 100 = unbearably painful) decreased in all treatment groups from the first to the last injection (placebo: 16.7 to 12.6; 25 mg: 12.0 to 9.0; 50 mg: 18.2 to 11.8). After the sixth injection (Week 10), investigator ratings indicated that 1% of patients treated with 25 mg or 50 mg risperidone (injection) experienced redness, swelling, or induration at the injection site.\n- In a separate study to observe local-site tolerability in which risperidone (injection) was administered into the deltoid muscle every 2 weeks over a period of 8 weeks, no patient discontinued treatment due to local injection site pain or reaction. Clinician ratings indicated that only mild redness, swelling, or induration at the injection site was observed in subjects treated with 37.5 mg or 50 mg risperidone (injection) at 2 hours after deltoid injection. All ratings returned to baseline at the predose assessment of the next injection 2 weeks later. No moderate or severe reactions were observed in any subject.\n\n【50】 ## Postmarketing Experience\n- The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of risperidone; because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency: agranulocytosis, alopecia, anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, atrial fibrillation, blood cholesterol increased, blood triglycerides increased, diabetes mellitus, diabetic ketoacidosis in patients with impaired glucose metabolism, drug withdrawal syndrome neonatal, dysgeusia, hypoglycemia, hypothermia, ileus, inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, intestinal obstruction, jaundice, mania, pancreatitis, priapism, QT prolongation, sleep apnea syndrome, thrombocytopenia, urinary retention, and water intoxication. In addition, the following adverse reactions have been observed during postapproval use of risperidone (injection): cerebrovascular disorders, including cerebrovascular accidents, and diabetes mellitus aggravated.\n- Retinal artery occlusion after injection of risperidone (injection) has been reported during postmarketing surveillance. This has been reported in the presence of abnormal arteriovenous anastomosis.\n\n【51】 #Drug Interactions\n- The interactions of risperidone (injection) with coadministration of other drugs have not been systematically evaluated\n\n【52】 ## Centrally-Acting Drugs and Alcohol\n- Given the primary CNS effects of risperidone, caution should be used when risperidone (injection) is administered in combination with other centrally-acting drugs or alcohol.\n\n【53】 ## Drugs with Hypotensive Effects\n- Because of its potential for inducing hypotension, risperidone (injection) may enhance the hypotensive effects of other therapeutic agents with this potential.\n\n【54】 ## Levodopa and Dopamine Agonists\n- Risperidone (injection) may antagonize the effects of levodopa and dopamine agonists.\n\n【55】 ## Amitriptyline\n- Amitriptyline did not affect the pharmacokinetics of risperidone or of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone combined following concomitant administration with oral risperidone.\n\n【56】 ## Cimetidine and Ranitidine\n- Cimetidine and ranitidine increased the bioavailability of oral risperidone by 64% and 26%, respectively. However, cimetidine did not affect the AUC of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone combined, whereas ranitidine increased the AUC of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone combined by 20%.\n\n【57】 ## Clozapine\n- Chronic administration of clozapine with risperidone may decrease the clearance of risperidone.\n\n【58】 ## Lithium\n- Repeated doses of oral risperidone (3 mg twice daily) did not affect the exposure (AUC) or peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) of lithium (n=13).\n\n【59】 ## Valproate\n- Repeated doses of oral risperidone (4 mg once daily) did not affect the pre-dose or average plasma concentrations and exposure (AUC) of valproate (1000 mg/day in three divided doses) compared to placebo (n=21). However, there was a 20% increase in valproate peak plasma concentration (Cmax) after concomitant administration of oral risperidone.\n\n【60】 ## Digoxin\n- Oral risperidone (0.25 mg twice daily) did not show a clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of digoxin.\n\n【61】 ## Topiramate\n- Oral risperidone administered at doses from 1–6 mg/day concomitantly with topiramate 400 mg/day resulted in a 23% decrease in risperidone Cmax and a 33% decrease in risperidone AUC0–12 hour at steady state. Minimal reductions in the exposure to risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone combined, and no change for 9-hydroxyrisperidone were observed. This interaction is unlikely to be of clinical significance. There was no clinically relevant effect of oral risperidone on the pharmacokinetics of topiramate.\n\n【62】 ## Drugs That Inhibit CYP 2D6 and Other CYP Isozymes\n- Risperidone is metabolized to 9-hydroxyrisperidone by CYP 2D6, an enzyme that is polymorphic in the population and that can be inhibited by a variety of psychotropic and other drugs. Drug interactions that reduce the metabolism of risperidone to 9-hydroxyrisperidone would increase the plasma concentrations of risperidone and lower the concentrations of 9-hydroxyrisperidone. Analysis of clinical studies involving a modest number of poor metabolizers (n≅70 patients) does not suggest that poor and extensive metabolizers have different rates of adverse effects. No comparison of effectiveness in the two groups has been made.\n- In vitro studies showed that drugs metabolized by other CYP isozymes, including 1A1, 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, and 3A4, are only weak inhibitors of risperidone metabolism.\n- Fluoxetine and Paroxetine\n- Fluoxetine (20 mg once daily) and paroxetine (20 mg once daily), CYP 2D6 inhibitors, have been shown to increase the plasma concentration of risperidone 2.5–2.8 fold and 3–9 fold respectively. Fluoxetine did not affect the plasma concentration of 9-hydroxyrisperidone. Paroxetine lowered the concentration of 9-hydroxyrisperidone by about 10%. When either concomitant fluoxetine or paroxetine is initiated or discontinued, the physician should re-evaluate the dose of risperidone (injection). When initiation of fluoxetine or paroxetine is considered, patients may be placed on a lower dose of risperidone (injection) between 2 to 4 weeks before the planned start of fluoxetine or paroxetine therapy to adjust for the expected increase in plasma concentrations of risperidone. When fluoxetine or paroxetine is initiated in patients receiving the recommended dose of 25 mg risperidone (injection), it is recommended to continue treatment with the 25-mg dose unless clinical judgment necessitates lowering the risperidone (injection) dose to 12.5 mg or necessitates interruption of risperidone (injection) treatment. When risperidone (injection) is initiated in patients already receiving fluoxetine or paroxetine, a starting dose of 12.5 mg can be considered. The efficacy of the 12.5 mg dose has not been investigated in clinical trials. The effects of discontinuation of concomitant fluoxetine or paroxetine therapy on the pharmacokinetics of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone have not been studied.\n- Erythromycin\n- There were no significant interactions between oral risperidone and erythromycin.\n\n【63】 ## Carbamazepine and Other CYP 3A4 Enzyme Inducers\n- Carbamazepine co-administration with oral risperidone decreased the steady-state plasma concentrations of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone by about 50%. Plasma concentrations of carbamazepine did not appear to be affected. Co-administration of other known CYP 3A4 enzyme inducers (e.g. phenytoin, rifampin, and phenobarbital) with risperidone may cause similar decreases in the combined plasma concentrations of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone, which could lead to decreased efficacy of risperidone (injection) treatment. At the initiation of therapy with carbamazepine or other known hepatic enzyme inducers, patients should be closely monitored during the first 4–8 weeks, since the dose of risperidone (injection) may need to be adjusted. A dose increase, or additional oral risperidone, may need to be considered. On discontinuation of carbamazepine or other CYP 3A4 hepatic enzyme inducers, the dosage of risperidone (injection) should be re-evaluated and, if necessary, decreased. Patients may be placed on a lower dose of risperidone (injection) between 2 to 4 weeks before the planned discontinuation of carbamazepine or other CYP 3A4 enzyme inducers to adjust for the expected increase in plasma concentrations of risperidone plus 9-hydroxyrisperidone. For patients treated with the recommended dose of 25 mg risperidone (injection) and discontinuing from carbamazepine or other CYP 3A4 enzyme inducers, it is recommended to continue treatment with the 25-mg dose unless clinical judgment necessitates lowering the risperidone (injection) dose to 12.5 mg or necessitates interruption of risperidone (injection) treatment. The efficacy of the 12.5 mg dose has not been investigated in clinical trials.\n\n【64】 ## Drugs Metabolized by CYP 2D6\n- In vitro studies indicate that risperidone is a relatively weak inhibitor of CYP 2D6. Therefore, risperidone (injection) is not expected to substantially inhibit the clearance of drugs that are metabolized by this enzymatic pathway. In drug interaction studies, oral risperidone did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of donepezil and galantamine, which are metabolized by CYP 2D6.\n\n【65】 ### Pregnancy\nPregnancy Category (FDA): C\n- The teratogenic potential of oral risperidone was studied in three embryofetal development studies in Sprague-Dawley and Wistar rats (0.63–10 mg/kg or 0.4 to 6 times the oral maximum recommended human dose  on a mg/m2 basis) and in one embryofetal development study in New Zealand rabbits (0.31–5 mg/kg or 0.4 to 6 times the oral MRHD on a mg/m2 basis). The incidence of malformations was not increased compared to control in offspring of rats or rabbits given 0.4 to 6 times the oral MRHD on a mg/m2 basis. In three reproductive studies in rats (two peri/post-natal development studies and a multigenerational study), there was an increase in pup deaths during the first 4 days of lactation at doses of 0.16–5 mg/kg or 0.1 to 3 times the oral MRHD on a mg/m2 basis. It is not known whether these deaths were due to a direct effect on the fetuses or pups or to effects on the dams.\n- No studies were conducted with risperidone (injection).\n- Placental transfer of risperidone occurs in rat pups. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. However, there was one report of a case of agenesis of the corpus callosum in an infant exposed to risperidone in utero. The causal relationship to oral risperidone therapy is unknown.\n\n【66】 ### Non-Teratogenic Effects\n- Neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs (including risperidone) during the third trimester of pregnancy are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery. There have been reports of agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, and feeding disorder in these neonates. These complications have varied in severity; while in some cases symptoms have been self-limited, in other cases neonates have required intensive care unit support and prolonged hospitalization.\n- risperidone (injection) should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\nPregnancy Category (AUS):\nThere is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Risperidone (injection) in women who are pregnant.\n\n【67】 ### Labor and Delivery\n- The effect of risperidone (injection) on labor and delivery in humans is unknown.\n\n【68】 ### Nursing Mothers\n- Risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone are also excreted in human breast milk. Therefore, women should not breast-feed during treatment with risperidone (injection) and for at least 12 weeks after the last injection.\n\n【69】 ### Pediatric Use\n- Risperidone (injection) has not been studied in children younger than 18 years old. However, juvenile animal toxicology studies have been conducted with oral risperidone.\n- Juvenile dogs were treated for 40 weeks with oral risperidone doses of 0.31, 1.25, or 5 mg/kg/day. Decreased bone length and density were seen, with a no-effect dose of 0.31 mg/kg/day. This dose produced plasma levels (AUC) of risperidone plus its active metabolite paliperidone (9-hydroxy-risperidone) which were similar to those in children and adolescents receiving the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 6 mg/day. In addition, a delay in sexual maturation was seen at all doses in both males and females. The above effects showed little or no reversibility in females after a 12 week drug-free recovery period.\n- The long-term effects of risperidone on growth and sexual maturation have not been fully evaluated in children and adolescents.\n\n【70】 ### Geriatic Use\n- In an open-label study, 57 clinically stable, elderly patients (≥65 years old) with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder received risperidone (injection) every 2 weeks for up to 12 months. In general, no differences in the tolerability of risperidone (injection) were observed between otherwise healthy elderly and nonelderly patients. Therefore, dosing recommendations for otherwise healthy elderly patients are the same as for nonelderly patients. Because elderly patients exhibit a greater tendency to orthostatic hypotension than nonelderly patients, elderly patients should be instructed in nonpharmacologic interventions that help to reduce the occurrence of orthostatic hypotension (e.g. sitting on the edge of the bed for several minutes before attempting to stand in the morning and slowly rising from a seated position). In addition, monitoring of orthostatic vital signs should be considered in elderly patients for whom orthostatic hypotension is of concern.\n- Concomitant use with Furosemide in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis\n\n【71】 ### Gender\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Risperidone (injection) with respect to specific gender populations.\n\n【72】 ### Race\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Risperidone (injection) with respect to specific racial populations.\n\n【73】 ### Renal Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Risperidone (injection) in patients with renal impairment.\n\n【74】 ### Hepatic Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Risperidone (injection) in patients with hepatic impairment.\n\n【75】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Risperidone (injection) in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n\n【76】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\nThere is no FDA guidance one the use of Risperidone (injection) in patients who are immunocompromised.\n\n【77】 ### Administration\n- Intramuscular.\n\n【78】 ### Monitoring\nThere is limited information regarding Risperidone (injection) Monitoring in the drug label.\n\n【79】 #IV Compatibility\nThere is limited information regarding the compatibility of Risperidone (injection) and IV administrations.\n\n【80】 ## Human Experience\n- No cases of overdose were reported in premarketing studies with risperidone (injection). Because risperidone (injection) is to be administered by health care professionals, the potential for overdosage by patients is low.\n- In premarketing experience with oral risperidone, there were eight reports of acute risperidone overdosage, with estimated doses ranging from 20 to 300 mg and no fatalities. In general, reported signs and symptoms were those resulting from an exaggeration of the drug's known pharmacological effects, i.e. drowsiness and sedation, tachycardia and hypotension, and extrapyramidal symptoms. One case, involving an estimated overdose of 240 mg, was associated with hyponatremia, hypokalemia, prolonged QT, and widened QRS. Another case, involving an estimated overdose of 36 mg, was associated with a seizure.\n\n【81】 ## Management of Overdosage\n- In case of acute overdosage, establish and maintain an airway and ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation. Cardiovascular monitoring should commence immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmias. If antiarrhythmic therapy is administered, disopyramide, procainamide, and quinidine carry a theoretical hazard of QT prolonging effects that might be additive to those of risperidone. Similarly, it is reasonable to expect that the alpha-blocking properties of bretylium might be additive to those of risperidone, resulting in problematic hypotension.\n\n【82】 ## Mechanism of Action\n- The mechanism of action of risperidone (injection), as with other drugs used to treat schizophrenia, is unknown. However, it has been proposed that the drug's therapeutic activity in schizophrenia is mediated through a combination of dopamine Type 2 (D2) and serotonin Type 2 (5HT2) receptor antagonism.\n- risperidone is a selective monoaminergic antagonist with high affinity (Ki of 0.12 to 7.3 nM) for the serotonin Type 2 (5HT2), dopamine Type 2 (D2), α1 and α2 adrenergic, and H1 histaminergic receptors. risperidone acts as an antagonist at other receptors, but with lower potency. risperidone has low to moderate affinity (Ki of 47 to 253 nM) for the serotonin 5HT1C, 5HT1D, and 5HT1A receptors, weak affinity (Ki of 620 to 800 nM) for the dopamine D1 and haloperidol-sensitive sigma site, and no affinity (when tested at concentrations >10-5 M) for cholinergic muscarinic or β1 and β2 adrenergic receptors.\n\n【83】 ## Structure\n- Risperidone is a psychotropic agent belonging to the chemical class of benzisoxazole derivatives. The chemical designation is 3-ethyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-2-methyl-4H-pyridopyrimidin-4-one. Its molecular formula is C23H27FN4O2 and its molecular weight is 410.49. The structural formula is:\n- Risperidone is practically insoluble in water, freely soluble in methylene chloride, and soluble in methanol and 0.1 N HCl.\n- Risperidone (injection) Long-Acting Injection is a combination of extended-release microspheres for injection and diluent for parenteral use.\n- The extended-release microspheres formulation is a white to off-white, free-flowing powder that is available in dosage strengths of 12.5 mg, 25 mg, 37.5 mg, or 50 mg risperidone per vial. Risperidone is micro-encapsulated in 7525 polylactide-co-glycolide (PLG) at a concentration of 381 mg risperidone per gram of microspheres.\n- Risperidone (injection) is provided as a dose pack, consisting of a vial containing the microspheres, a pre-filled syringe containing the diluent, a SmartSite Needle-Free Vial Access Device, and two Needle-Pro safety needles (a 21 G UTW 1-inch needle with needle protection device for deltoid administration and a 20 G TW 2-inch needle with needle protection device for gluteal administration).\n\n【84】 ## Pharmacodynamics\n- The clinical effect from risperidone (injection) results from the combined concentrations of risperidone and its major metabolite, 9-hydroxyrisperidone. Antagonism at receptors other than D2 and 5HT2 may explain some of the other effects of risperidone (injection).\n\n【85】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n- Absorption\n- After a single intramuscular (gluteal) injection of risperidone (injection), there is a small initial release of the drug (< 1% of the dose), followed by a lag time of 3 weeks. The main release of the drug starts from 3 weeks onward, is maintained from 4 to 6 weeks, and subsides by 7 weeks following the intramuscular (IM) injection. Therefore, oral antipsychotic supplementation should be given during the first 3 weeks of treatment with risperidone (injection) to maintain therapeutic levels until the main release of risperidone from the injection site has begun. Following single doses of risperidone (injection), the pharmacokinetics of risperidone, 9-hydroxyrisperidone (the major metabolite), and risperidone plus 9-hydroxyrisperidone were linear in the dosing range of 12.5 mg to 50 mg.\n- The combination of the release profile and the dosage regimen (IM injections every 2 weeks) of risperidone (injection) results in sustained therapeutic concentrations. Steady-state plasma concentrations are reached after 4 injections and are maintained for 4 to 6 weeks after the last injection. Following multiple doses of 25 mg and 50 mg risperidone (injection), plasma concentrations of risperidone, 9-hydroxyrisperidone, and risperidone plus 9-hydroxyrisperidone were linear.\n- Deltoid and gluteal intramuscular injections at the same doses are bioequivalent and, therefore, interchangeable.\n- Distribution\n- Once absorbed, risperidone is rapidly distributed. The volume of distribution is 1–2 L/kg. In plasma, risperidone is bound to albumin and α1-acid glycoprotein. The plasma protein binding of risperidone is approximately 90%, and that of its major metabolite, 9-hydroxyrisperidone, is 77%. Neither risperidone nor 9-hydroxyrisperidone displaces each other from plasma binding sites. High therapeutic concentrations of sulfamethazine (100 mcg/mL), warfarin (10 mcg/mL), and carbamazepine (10 mcg/mL) caused only a slight increase in the free fraction of risperidone at 10 ng/mL and of 9-hydroxyrisperidone at 50 ng/mL, changes of unknown clinical significance.\n- Metabolism and Drug Interactions\n- Risperidone is extensively metabolized in the liver. The main metabolic pathway is through hydroxylation of risperidone to 9-hydroxyrisperidone by the enzyme, CYP 2D6. A minor metabolic pathway is through N-dealkylation. The main metabolite, 9-hydroxyrisperidone, has similar pharmacological activity as risperidone. Consequently, the clinical effect of the drug results from the combined concentrations of risperidone plus 9-hydroxyrisperidone.\n- The interactions of risperidone (injection) with coadministration of other drugs have not been systematically evaluated in human subjects. Drug interactions are based primarily on experience with oral risperidone. Risperidone could be subject to two kinds of drug-drug interactions. First, inhibitors of CYP 2D6 interfere with conversion of risperidone to 9-hydroxyrisperidone. This occurs with quinidine, giving essentially all recipients a risperidone pharmacokinetic profile typical of poor metabolizers. The therapeutic benefits and adverse effects of risperidone in patients receiving quinidine have not been evaluated, but observations in a modest number (n≅70) of poor metabolizers given oral risperidone do not suggest important differences between poor and extensive metabolizers. Second, co-administration of carbamazepine and other known enzyme inducers (e.g. phenytoin, rifampin, and phenobarbital) with oral risperidone cause a decrease in the combined plasma concentrations of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone. It would also be possible for risperidone to interfere with metabolism of other drugs metabolized by CYP 2D6. Relatively weak binding of risperidone to the enzyme suggests this is unlikely.\n- Excretion\n- Renal Impairment\n- In patients with moderate to severe renal disease treated with oral risperidone, clearance of the sum of risperidone and its active metabolite decreased by 60% compared with young healthy subjects. Although patients with renal impairment were not studied with risperidone (injection), it is recommended that patients with renal impairment be carefully titrated on oral risperidone before treatment with risperidone (injection) is initiated at a dose of 25 mg. A lower initial dose of 12. 5 mg may be appropriate when clinical factors warrant dose adjustment, such as in patients with renal impairment.\n- Elderly\n- Race and Gender Effects\n- No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate race and gender effects, but a population pharmacokinetic analysis did not identify important differences in the disposition of risperidone due to gender (whether or not corrected for body weight) or race.\n\n【86】 ### Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\n- Carcinogenesis - Risperidone (injection) was evaluated in a 24-month carcinogenicity study in which SPF Wistar rats were treated every 2 weeks with intramuscular (IM) injections of either 5 mg/kg or 40 mg/kg of risperidone. These doses are 1 and 8 times the MRHD (50 mg) on a mg/m2 basis. A control group received injections of 0.9% NaCl, and a vehicle control group was injected with placebo microspheres. There was a significant increase in pituitary gland adenomas, endocrine pancreas adenomas, and adrenomedullary pheochromocytomas at 8 times the IM MRHD on a mg/m2 basis. The incidence of mammary gland adenocarcinomas was significantly increased in female rats at both doses (1 and 8 times the IM MRHD on a mg/m2 basis). A significant increase in renal tubular tumors (adenoma, adenocarcinomas) was observed in male rats at 8 times the IM MRHD on a mg/m2 basis. Plasma exposures (AUC) in rats were 0.3 and 2 times (at 5 and 40 mg/kg, respectively) the expected plasma exposure (AUC) at the IM MRHD.\n- Dopamine D2 receptor antagonists have been shown to chronically elevate prolactin levels in rodents. Serum prolactin levels were not measured during the carcinogenicity studies of oral risperidone; however, measurements taken during subchronic toxicity studies showed that oral risperidone elevated serum prolactin levels 5- to 6-fold in mice and rats at the same doses used in the oral carcinogenicity studies. Serum prolactin levels increased in a dose-dependent manner up to 6- and 1.5-fold in male and female rats, respectively, at the end of the 24-month treatment with risperidone (injection) every 2 weeks. Increases in the incidence of pituitary gland, endocrine pancreas, and mammary gland neoplasms have been found in rodents after chronic administration of other antipsychotic drugs and may be prolactin-mediated.\n- The relevance for human risk of the findings of prolactin-mediated endocrine tumors in rodents is unknown.\n- Mutagenesis - No evidence of mutagenic potential for oral risperidone was found in the in vitro Ames reverse mutation test, in vitro mouse lymphoma assay, in vitro rat hepatocyte DNA-repair assay, in vivo oral micronucleus test in mice, the sex-linked recessive lethal test in Drosophila, or the in vitro chromosomal aberration test in human lymphocytes or in Chinese hamster cells.\n- In addition, no evidence of mutagenic potential was found in the in vitro Ames reverse mutation test for risperidone (injection).\n- Impairment of Fertility\n- No mating and fertility studies were conducted with risperidone (injection).\n\n【87】 ## Schizophrenia - The effectiveness of risperidone (injection) in the treatment of schizophrenia was established, in part, on the basis of extrapolation from the established effectiveness of the oral formulation of risperidone. In addition, the effectiveness of risperidone (injection) in the treatment of schizophrenia was established in a 12-week, placebo-controlled trial in adult psychotic inpatients and outpatients who met the DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia.\n- Efficacy data were obtained from 400 patients with schizophrenia who were randomized to receive injections of 25 mg, 50 mg, or 75 mg risperidone (injection) or placebo every 2 weeks. During a 1-week run-in period, patients were discontinued from other antipsychotics and were titrated to a dose of 4 mg oral risperidone. Patients who received risperidone (injection) were given doses of oral risperidone (2 mg for patients in the 25-mg group, 4 mg for patients in the 50-mg group, and 6 mg for patients in the 75-mg group) for the 3 weeks after the first injection to provide therapeutic plasma concentrations until the main release phase of risperidone from the injection site had begun. Patients who received placebo injections were given placebo tablets.\n- Efficacy was evaluated using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), a validated, multi-item inventory, composed of five subscales to evaluate positive symptoms, negative symptoms, disorganized thoughts, uncontrolled hostility/excitement, and anxiety/depression.\n- The primary efficacy variable in this trial was change from baseline to endpoint in the total PANSS score. The mean total PANSS score at baseline for schizophrenic patients in this study was 81.5.\n- Subgroup analyses did not indicate any differences in treatment outcome as a function of age, race, or gender.\n\n【88】 ## Bipolar Disorder - Monotherapy\n- The effectiveness of risperidone (injection) for the maintenance treatment of Bipolar I Disorder was established in a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of adult patients who met DSM-IV criteria for Bipolar Disorder Type I, who were stable on medications or experiencing an acute manic or mixed episode.\n- A total of 501 patients were treated during a 26-week open-label period with risperidone (injection) (starting dose of 25 mg, and titrated, if deemed clinically desirable, to 37.5 mg or 50 mg; in patients not tolerating the 25 mg dose, the dose could be reduced to 12.5 mg). In the open-label phase, 303 (60%) patients were judged to be stable and were randomized to double-blind treatment with either the same dose of risperidone (injection) or placebo and monitored for relapse. The primary endpoint was time to relapse to any mood episode (depression, mania, hypomania, or mixed).\n\n【89】 ## Bipolar Disorder - Adjunctive Therapy\n- The effectiveness of risperidone (injection) as an adjunct to treatment with lithium or valproate for the maintenance treatment of Bipolar Disorder was established in a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of adult patients who met DSM-IV criteria for Bipolar Disorder Type I and who experienced at least 4 episodes of mood disorder requiring psychiatric/clinical intervention in the previous 12 months, including at least 2 episodes in the 6 months prior to the start of the study.\n- A total of 240 patients were treated during a 16-week open-label period with risperidone (injection) (starting dose of 25 mg, and titrated, if deemed clinically desirable, to 37.5 mg or 50 mg), as adjunctive therapy in addition to continuing their treatment as usual for their bipolar disorder, which consisted of mood stabilizers (primarily lithium and valproate), antidepressants, and/or anxiolytics. All oral antipsychotics were discontinued after the first three weeks of the initial risperidone (injection) injection. In the open-label phase, 124 (51.7%) were judged to be stable for at least the last 4 weeks and were randomized to double-blind treatment with either the same dose of risperidone (injection) or placebo in addition to continuing their treatment as usual and monitored for relapse during a 52-week period. The primary endpoint was time to relapse to any new mood episode (depression, mania, hypomania, or mixed).\n- Time to relapse was delayed in patients receiving adjunctive therapy with risperidone (injection) as compared to placebo. The relapse types were about half depressive and half manic or mixed episodes.\n\n【90】 #How Supplied\n- RISPERDAL CONSTA is available in dosage strengths of 12.5 mg, 25 mg, 37.5 mg, or 50 mg risperidone. It is provided as a dose pack, consisting of a vial containing the risperidone microspheres, a pre-filled syringe containing 2 mL of diluent for RISPERDAL CONSTA, a West-Medimop Vial Adapter, and two Terumo SurGuard 3 Needles for intramuscular injection (a 21 G UTW 1-inch needle with needle protection device for deltoid administration and a 20 G TW 2-inch needle with needle protection device for gluteal administration).\n\n【91】 ## Storage\n- The entire dose pack should be stored in the refrigerator (36°– 46°F; 2°– 8°C) and protected from light.\n- If refrigeration is unavailable, RISPERDAL CONSTA can be stored at temperatures not exceeding 77°F (25°C) for no more than 7 days prior to administration.

Liposarcoma is a malignant tumor that arises in fat cells in deep soft tissue, such as that inside the thigh or in the retroperitoneum.\nThey are typically large bulky tumors which tend to have multiple smaller satellites extending beyond the main confines of the tumor.\n\n【2】 #Historical Perspective\nLiposarcoma was first described by Dr. Rudolph Virchow, a German pathologist, in 1857. Virchow reported a \"myxoma lipomatoides malignum\", highlighting the malignant nature of the tumor. Between 1954 and 1979, several authors reported cases of liposarcoma and suggested that liposarcoma should be classified according to histopathological analysis into well-differentiated, myxoid, and dedifferentiated subtypes.\n\n【3】 #Classification\nLiposarcoma may be classified into well-differentiated, de-differentiated, myxoid, round cell, or pleomorphic liposarcoma.\n\n【4】 #Pathophysiology\nThe pathogenesis of liposarcoma depends on the histological subtype. The role of proto-oncogenes has been implicated in the development of well-differentiated liposarcoma\n\n【5】 #Causes\nThere are no established causes for liposarcoma.\n\n【6】 #Differential Diagnosis\nLiposarcoma must be differentiated from other diseases that cause a painless, growing mass such as spindle cell lipoma, neurofibroma, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor.\n\n【7】 #Epidemiology and Demographics\nLiposarcoma is the second most common type of all soft tissue sarcomas in adults. The annual incidence is 0.25 cases per 100,000 individuals. Men are slightly more affected with liposarcoma than women. It is most frequent in middle-aged and older adults.\n\n【8】 #Risk Factors\nCommon risk factors in the development of liposarcoma include chemical carcinogens, radiation, immunodeficiency, genetic disorders, and viral infections.\n\n【9】 #Natural History, Complications and Prognosis\nCommon complication of liposarcoma include metastasis.  Mass may compress adjacent structures causing different clinical manifestations. Metastasis is the most important aspect to assess in the prognosis of liposarcoma. The prognosis will depend on the histopathological subtype, being the well differentiated liposarcoma the subtype with the best prognosis, and the pleomorphic liposarcoma with the worst prognosis.\n\n【10】 ## Staging\nThe staging of liposarcoma is based on the TNM classification, which includes primary tumor spread, lymph node involvement, and presence of metastasis.\n\n【11】 ## History and Symptoms\nLiposarcoma usually presents as a  painless mass. The most common location of a liposarcoma is the lower extremities.  Patients with retroperitoneal liposarcoma remain asymptomatic until the mass invades adjacent structures, which may cause pain or obstructive symptoms.\n\n【12】 ## Physical Examination\nPhysical examination findings of liposarcoma depend on the location of the tumor.  Since most liposarcomas are located in the lower extremities, liposarcoma is commonly associated with the findings of palpable firm nontender mass in one lower extremity. Physical examination of retroperitoneal liposarcomas is usually unremarkable, but other pertinent findings on physical examination of retroperitoneal liposarcomas include palpation of an abdominal mass, abdominal distension, and tenderness.\n\n【13】 ## Laboratory Findings\nThere are no specific laboratory tests for the diagnosis of liposarcoma. The pertinent laboratory findings of liposarcoma include anemia and elevated BUN due to GI bleeding and elevated creatinine among patients with obstructive nephropathy.\n\n【14】 ## Biopsy\nThe definitive diagnosis of liposarcoma is made by biopsy, which also provides histopathological classification of the liposarcoma's subtype.\n\n【15】 ## CT\nCT imaging is crucial for the diagnosis of liposarcoma\n\n【16】 ## MRI\nMRI is the optimal imaging test for the diagnosis of liposarcoma.  MRI findings for a well-differentiated liposarcoma include a mass with at least 75% of adipose content with thin irregular septa.  MRI also evaluates the size, location, and depth of the mass.  MRI findings help to differentiate between the different subtypes of liposarcoma and help to assess distant metastasis.\n\n【17】 ## Other Imaging Findings\nPositron emission tomography (PET) scan is useful in cases where the liposarcoma is firm, deep, and has a size greater than 3 cm.  PET scan may also help evaluate the grade and prognosis of the tumor,as well as its shrinkage following chemotherapy.\n\n【18】 ## Other Diagnostic Studies\nLi-Fraumeni syndrome is associated with liposarcoma. Mutations in the TP53 gene that encodes the tumor suppressor gene p53 cause Li-Fraumeni syndrome.\n\n【19】 ## Medical Therapy\nMedical therapy for liposarcoma includes  Chemotherapy, chemoradiation, immunotherapy and targeted therapy.\n\n【20】 ## Surgery\nThe predominant therapy for liposarcoma is surgical resection. Adjunctive chemotherapy and radiation may be required.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

The popliteal artery may be compressed behind the knee, due to congenital deformity of the muscles or tendon insertions of the popliteal space. This repetitive trauma may result in stenotic artery degeneration, complete artery occlusion or even formation of an aneurysm.\n\n【2】 #History\nThe syndrome was first described in 1879 by Anderson Stuart, a medical student, in a 64-year-old male. Hamming and Vink in 1959 first described the management of the popliteal artery syndrome in a 12-year-old patient. The patient was treated with myotomy of the medial head of the gastrocnemius muscle and concomitant endarterectomy of the popliteal artery. They later reported four more cases and claimed that the incidence of this pathology in patients younger than 30 years old with claudication was 40%. Servello was the first to draw attention to diminished distal pulses observed with forced plantar or dorsiflexion in patients suffering from this syndrome. Bouhoutsos and Daskalakis in 1981 reported 45 cases of this syndrome in a population of 20,000 Greek soldiers. During the recent years the increasing frequency with which popliteal artery entrapment is reported, strongly suggests a greater awareness of the syndrome.\n\n【3】 #Etiology\n- A development defect in which the popliteal artery passes medial to and beneath the medial head of gastrocnemius muscle\n- A slip of the muscle with consequent compression of the artery.\n- Rarely an anomalous fibrous band - Popliteal muscle deep to the medial head of gastrocnemius compressing structure both artery and vein.\n\n【4】 #Types\n- Type I: Artery displaced in an exaggerated loop\n- Type III: Accessory slip of muscle compresses\n- Type V: Any of the above with vein involvement\n- Type VI: Functional type artery occludes  with plantar flexion but no anatomical abnormality.\n\n【5】 #Clinical Findings\n- Claudication in the calf and foot of a young man.\n- Nine times more common in men\n- Onset of symptoms is often sudden occurring during the episode of intense lower extremity activity such as during running.\n- Symptoms correlate with the development of segmental occlusion of mid pop artery.\n- Symptoms include cramping in the calf and foot and coldness, blanching, paresthesias, with walking and relieved with rest.\n- Pedal pulses absent in 63%, diminished in 10% and palpable in 16% and in 11% disappear with  passive dorsiflexion or active planter flexion.\n- Increased collaterals around knee.\n- Geniculate arteries may be palpable over the anteromedial and anterolateral aspects of knee which is warm.\n- PVR could be done before and after dorsiflexion and plantarflexion.\n- Systolic bruit may be present.\n- Distended superficial veins, edema and dependent cyanosis could suggest venous involvement.\n\n【6】 #Diagnosis\nTwo or more of the following finding on Femoral arteriography\nIn addition stress angiograms with the leg actively planter flexed against resistance or passively dorsiflexed to show compression  that may not be seen in neutral position.\nDuplex scanning of the popliteal artery for compression. Baseline and then repeat with active planter flexion.\nMRI or CT  to study anatomy in the popliteal fossa may be helpful.\n\n【7】 #Summary\n- Rare but important cause of arterial insufficiency in younger patients.\n- High index of suspicion combined with dynamic non invasive testing and stress arteriography should be performed.\n- Medial deviation though diagnostic absence does not exclude it.\n- Surgical exploration with relief of constricting lesion  and arterial reconstruction  if thrombosis should be done.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Naturally quiet people, they are interested in understanding how systems operate, focusing on efficient operation and structure.  They are open to new information and approaches.  But contrary to their seemingly detached natures, ISTPs are often capable of humorously insightful observations about the world around them, and can be closet \"daredevils\" who gravitate toward fast-moving and/or risky hobbies (such as bungee jumping, hang gliding, motorcycling, parachuting, SCUBA diving, etc.), recreational sports (such as downhill skiing, ice hockey, racing, etc.), and careers (such as aviation, firefighting, etc.).\n\n【2】 #Keirsey Characteristics\nAccording to Keirsey, ISTPs, or \"Crafter Artisans\", are masters at using tools of every type—artistic, technological, martial.  Although they are introverts, they are authoritarian in their interactions with others and can be forceful at influencing people. They focus on accomplishing tasks efficiently and skillfully.\nTo master the tool of their interest, ISTPs require a certain degree of seclusion in which to practice. The result is often a virtuosity that other types find difficult to match.\n\n【3】 #MBTI cognitive functions\nThe attributes of each personality form a hierarchy.  This represents the person's \"default\" pattern of behavior in their day to day life. The Dominant is the personality type's preferred role, the task they feel most comfortable with.  The auxiliary function is the role they feel the next most comfortable with.  It serves to support and expand on the dominant function.  One of these first two will always be an information gathering function (sensing or intuition) and the other will be a decision making function(thinking or feeling) in some order. The tertiary function is less developed than the Dominant and Auxiliary functions, but develops as the person matures and provides roundness of ability.  The inferior function is the personality types Achilles heel. This is the function they are least comfortable with. Like the tertiary function, this function strengthens with maturity.\n- Dominant Introverted Thinking-The ISTP lives a world of logic, basing any decision on logic. They process information from their auxiliary function to create strategies for action at a moment's notice. They love to examine complicated systems.\n- Auxiliary Extroverted Sensing-This function gives the ISTP an element of spontaneity, embracing chances to plunge headfirst into experiences. It also gives them a keen insight into situations similar to that of the ISTJ. Their occasionally tunnelvisioned curiosity for the world around them gives them a \"leap before you look\" tendency. They are notorious for taking apart devices to \"see what makes them tick\", before consideration as to whether they can put them back together.\n- Tertiary Introverted iNtuition-Never as open in their theorizing as the INTP, the ISTP prefers to keep themselves grounded in the situation at hand, using their intuition to visualize components and concepts that they cannot see and touch firsthand, such as the wiring in a circuit board.\n- inferior Extroverted Feeling- The weak point of the ISTP, they may interpret criticisms of their ideas as criticisms of their competence.  While they strive to follow the edicts of logic, this can also lead them to ironically and illogically stubbornly cling to their own ideas even when proven wrong.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

For example, in Africa, up to 80% of the population uses traditional medicine for primary health care. The WHO, however, also notes that its use is spreading in popularity in industrialized countries. For example, in the United States, 158 million adults use alternative medicine (a field which incorporates traditional medicine but is broader in scope).\nThe WHO also notes, though, that \"inappropriate use of traditional medicines or practices can have negative or dangerous effects\" and that \"further research is needed to ascertain the efficacy and safety\" of several of the practices and medicinal plants used by traditional medicine systems.\nCore disciplines which study traditional medicine include ethnomedicine, ethnobotany, and medical anthropology.\n\n【1】 #Classical history\nEarly recognised compilers of existing and current herbal knowledge were the Greeks Hippocrates, Aristotle, Theophrastus (b. 370 BC), Dioscorides and Galen. Roman writers were Pliny and Celsus (Kay, 1996). Dioscorides (Pedianos Dioskurides) included the writings of the herbalist Krateuas, physician to Mithridates VI King of Pontus from 120 to 63 BC in his De Materia Medica (Codex Vindobonensis) (Blunt and Raphael, 1994). De Materia Medica was translated into several languages and Turkish, Arabic and Hebrew names were added to it throughout the centuries (Blunt and Raphael, 1994). Latin manuscripts of De Materia Medica were combined with a Latin herbal by Apuleius Platonicus and were incorporated into the Anglo-Saxon codex Cotton Vitellius C.III. These early Greek and Roman compilations became the backbone of European medical theory and were translated by the Arabs Avicenna (Ibn Sīnā, 980 - 1037), the Persian Rhazes (Rāzi, 865 - 925) and the Jewish Maimonides (Kay, 1996). Translations of Greek medical handbooks and manuscripts into Arabic took place in the eighth and ninth centuries. Arabic indigenous medicine developed from the conflict between the magic-based medicine of the Bedouins, the Arabic translations of the Hellenic medicine and Ayurvedic medicine (Slikkerveer, 1990). Spanish indigenous medicine was influenced by the Arabs from 711 to 1492 (Hernández-Bermejo and García Sánchez, 1998).  Translations of the early Roman-Greek compilations were made into German by Hieronymus Bock whose herbal published in 1546 was called Kreuter Buch. A Dutch translation Pemptades by Rembert Dodoens  was translated by Charles de l'Écluse (Carolus Clusius, 1526-1609), and was published in English by Henry Lyte in 1578 as A Nievve Herball. This became John Gerard's (1545 - 1612) Herball or General Hiftorie of Plantes (Blunt and Raphael, 1994; Kay, 1996). Each new work was a compilation of existing texts with new additions.\nWomen's folk knowledge existed in undocumented parallel with these texts  and Italian editions were published for the next century.\n\n【2】 #Oral traditions\nIndigenous medicine is sometimes unwritten and transmitted orally; until someone \"collects\" it. Within a given culture, elements of indigenous medicine knowledge may be diffusely known by many, or may be gathered and applied by those in a specific role of healer (shaman, midwife, etc.)\nIn indigenous medicine there are three factors that legitimise the healer: the subjective reality of the healer; the objective reality based on his/her successful cures; and the belief systems of the community (locally and globally influenced) which impacts on the first two (Laguerre, 1987). Laguerre  claims that rejected knowledge (like some types of indigenous or folk knowledge) has three types of adherents. Those born and socialised in it who would be permanent believers, temporary believers who turn to it in crisis times, and those who only believe in specific aspects, not in all of it. There are also three types of transmission of indigenous knowledge or medicine: the society and community, the family, and the individual (dreams).\nElements in a specific culture are not necessarily integrated into a coherent system, and may be contradictory. For example Caribbean indigenous remedies fall into several classes: certain well-known European medicinal herbs introduced by the early Spaniard colonists that are still commonly cultivated; indigenous wild and cultivated plants, the uses of which have been adopted from the Amerindians; and ornamental or other plants of relatively recent introduction for which curative uses have been invented without any historical basis (Morton, 1975). This invention would have been facilitated by the widespread introduction of plant species from all over the world for ornamental and medicinal reasons (Bayley, 1949).\n\n【3】 #Herbal medicine\nHerbal medicine is an aspect of indigenous medicine - the use of gathered plant parts to make teas, poultices, or powders that purportedly effect cures.\nThere has been a Spanish Catholic contribution to indigenous medicine in Trinidad. Growers and sellers of culinary herbs in Paramin .\n\n【4】 #American indigenous medicine\nIn the United States, an old indigenous medicine field called apitherapy,  in which bee stings or venom is used to aid victims of autoimmune disorders like arthritis or multiple sclerosis, is receiving renewed interest in recent years.\n\"Vermont indigenous medicine\" was a supposed local form of indigenous medicine from which D. C. Jarvis claimed to derive his \"cures\". Apple cider vinegar was a major ingredient in the mixtures prescribed by Dr. Jarvis and described in his 1958 book, Folk Medicine.  Mennonite and Amish European migrants in the 18th and 19th century brought their indigenous medicine with them to America.

Qi is believed to be part of every living thing that exists, as a kind of \"life force\" or \"spiritual energy\". It is frequently translated as \"energy flow\", or literally as \"air\" or \"breath\". (For example, \"tiānqì\", literally \"sky breath\", is the ordinary Chinese word for \"weather\"). In Mandarin Chinese it is pronounced something like \"chee\" in English, but the tongue position is different.\n\n【1】 #Etymology\nThe etymological explanation for the form of the qi logogram in the traditional form 氣 is “steam (气) rising from rice (米) as it cooks”.\nThe earliest way of writing qi consisted of three wavy lines, used to represent one's breath seen on a cold day. A later version, 气, (identical to the present-day simplified character) is a stylized version of those same three lines. For some reason, early writers of Chinese found it desirable to substitute for 气 a cognate, character that originally meant to feed other people in a social context such as providing food for guests. Appropriately, that character combined the three-line qi character with the character for the grain we call rice. So 气 plus 米 formed 氣, and that is the traditional character still used today.\nPhilosophical conceptions of qi date from the earliest recorded times in Chinese thinking. One of the important early cultural heroes in Chinese mythology is Huang Di (the Yellow Emperor). He is identified in the legends of China as the one who first collected and formalized much of what subsequently became known as traditional Chinese medicine.\nThe earliest extant book that speaks of qi is the Analects of Confucius (composed from the notes of individual students some time after his death in 479 B.C.) Unlike the legendary accounts mentioned above, the Analects has a clear date in history, and most later books (at least the ones that do not purport to be relics of the legendary earliest rulers) can also be assigned clear dates in history.\nAlthough the concept of qi has been very important within many Chinese philosophies, over the centuries their descriptions of qi have been varied and may seem to be in conflict with each other. Understanding of these disputes is complicated for people who did not grow up using the Chinese concept and its associated concepts. Until China came into contact with Western scientific and philosophical ideas (primarily by way of Catholic missionaries), they knew about things like stones and lightning, but they would not have categorized them in terms of matter and energy. Qi and li (理, li, pattern) are their fundamental categories much as matter and energy have been fundamental categories for people in the West. Their use of qi (lifebreath) and li (pattern, regularity, form, order) as their primary categories leaves in question how to account for liquids and solids, and, once the Western idea of energy came on the scene, how to relate it to the native idea of \"qi\". If Chinese and Western concepts are mixed in an attempt to characterize some of the problems that arise with the Chinese conceptual system, then one might ask whether qi exists as a \"force\" separate from \"matter\", whether qi arises from \"matter\", or whether \"matter\" arises from qi. But those questions occur only in the hybrid conceptual system.\nAnalysis of the relationship between qi (breath, lifebreath) and li (the patterns, regularities, or the formal aspect of things) has been very difficult for Chinese philosophers. In addition, how to account for what people in the West might casually categorize as \"solid stuff\" was also a problem. Fairly early on, some Chinese thinkers began to believe that there are different fractions of qi (in the sense that different fractions can be extracted from crude oil in a catalytic cracker), and that the coarsest and heaviest fractions of qi form solid things such as rocks, the earth, etc. whereas lighter fractions form liquids, and the most ethereal fractions are the \"lifebreath\" that animates living beings.\n\n【2】 #Qi in early philosophical texts\nThe earliest texts that speak of qi give some indications of how the concept developed, He reported that early civilized humans learned how to live in houses to protect their qi from the moisture that had troubled them when they lived in caves. He also associated maintaining one's qi with providing oneself adequate nutrition. And, in regard to another kind of qi he recorded how some people performed a kind of prognostication by observing the qi (clouds) in the sky.\nIn the \"Analects of Confucius\", (composed from the notes of individual students sometime after his death in 479 B.C.), \"qi\" can mean \"breath\", and it can be combined with the Chinese word for blood (making 血氣, xue-qi, blood and breath) and that concept can be used to account for motivational characteristics. The Analects, 16:7, says:\nThe  noble man guards himself against three things. When he is young, his xue-qi has not yet stabilized, so he guards himself against sexual passion.  When he reaches his prime, his xue-qi is not easily subdued, so he guards himself against combativeness. When he reaches old age, his xue-qi is already depleted, so he guards himself against acquisitiveness.\nMeng Ke (also known as Meng Zi, Master Meng, or Mencius) described a kind of qi that might be characterized as an individual's vital energies. This qi was necessary to activity, and it could be controlled by a well-integrated will power. But this qi could not adequately be characterized by English words like \"lifebreath\" or \"bio-plasma\" because when properly nurtured it was capable of extending beyond the human body to reach throughout the universe. This qi can be augmented by means of careful exercise of one's moral capacities. On the other hand, the qi of an individual can be degraded by averse external forces that succeed in operating on that individual.\nNot only human beings and animals were believed to have \"qi\".  Zhuang Zhou (also known as Zhuang Zi or Master Zhuang) indicated that wind is the \"qi\" of the earth. Moreover, cosmic Yin and Yang \"are the greatest of 'qi'.\" He describes qi as \"issuing forth\" and creating profound effects.\nZhuang Zi gave us one of the most productive of insights into the nature of \"qi\". He said \"Human beings are born  the accumulation of 'qi'. When it accumulates there is life. When it dissipates there is death There is one 'qi' that connects and pervades everything in the world.\"\nAnother passage traces life to intercourse between Heaven and Earth: \"The highest Yin is the most restrained. The highest Yang is the most exuberant. The restrained comes forth from Heaven. The exuberant issues forth from Earth. The two intertwine and penetrate forming a harmony, and  things are born.\"\nZhuang Zi was a contemporary of Mencius. Xun Zi followed them after some years. At 9:69/127, Xun Zi says: \"Fire and water have qi but do not have life. Grasses and trees have life but do not have perceptivity. Fowl and beasts have perceptivity but do not have yi (sense of right and wrong, duty, justice). Men have qi, life, perceptivity, and yi.\" This passage gives us some insight into his idea of \"qi\". Chinese people at such an early time had no concept of radiant energy. But they were aware that one can be heated by a campfire even though the air between camper and fire is quite cold. Clearly, something is emitted by the fire and reaches the camper. They called it \"qi\",\n\n【3】 Heaven  falls (duo 墮, i.e. descends into proto-immanence) as the formless. Fleeting, fluttering, penetrating, amorphous it is, and so it is called the Supreme Luminary. The dao begins in the Void Brightening. The Void Brightening produces the universe (yu-zhou ). The universe produces qi. Qi has bounds. The clear, yang  was ethereal and so formed heaven. The heavy, turbid  was congealed and impeded and so formed earth. The conjunction of the clear, yang  was fluid and easy. The conjunction of the heavy, turbid  was strained and difficult. So heaven was formed first and earth was made fast later. The pervading essence (xi-jing) of heaven and earth becomes yin and yang. The concentrated (zhuan) essences of yin and yang become the four seasons. The dispersed (san) essences of the four seasons become the myriad creatures. The hot qi of yang in accumulating produces fire. The essence (jing) of the fire-qi becomes the sun. The cold qi of yin in accumulating produces water. The essence of the water-qi becomes the moon. The essences produced by coitus (yin) of the sun and moon become the stars and celestial markpoints (chen, planets).\nThe development of the ideas of qi and of qi zhi zhi xing (氣質之性) in Neo-Confucianism go beyond the scope of a fundamental account of Chinese ideas about qi, but the fundamentals are contained in the above passage.\n\n【4】 #Qi in traditional Chinese medicine\nTheories of traditional Chinese medicine assert that the body has natural patterns of qi that circulate in channels called meridians in English. Symptoms of various illnesses are often believed to be the product of disrupted, blocked, or unbalanced qi movement (interrupted flow) through the body's meridians, as well as deficiencies or imbalances of qi (homeostatic imbalance) in the various Zang Fu organs. Traditional Chinese medicine often seeks to relieve these imbalances by adjusting the circulation of qi (metabolic energy flow) in the body using a variety of therapeutic techniques. Some of these techniques include herbal medicines, special diets, physical training regimens (Qigong, Tai Chi Chuan, and martial arts training), moxibustion, massage to clear blockages, and acupuncture, which uses small diameter metal needles inserted into the skin and underlying tissues to reroute or balance qi.\n\n【5】 #Qi in Feng Shui\nThe traditional Chinese art of placement and arrangement of space called Feng Shui is based on the flow of qi, interactions between the five elements, yin and yang and other factors. The retention or dissipation of qi is believed to affect the health, wealth, energy level, luck and many other aspects of the occupants of the space.  Color, shape and the physical location of each item in a space affects the flow of qi by slowing it down, redirecting it or accelerating it, which directly affects the energy level of the occupants.\n\n【6】 #Nature of qi\nDisputing the nature of qi is an old pursuit in Chinese philosophy.  Among some traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, qi is sometimes thought of as a metaphor for biological processes similar to the Western concept of energy flow for homeostatic balance in biological regulations.  Attempts to directly connect qi with some scientific phenomena have been made since the mid-nineteenth century. The philosopher Kang Youwei believed that qi was synonymous with the later-abandoned concept of luminiferous ether.\nViews of qi as an esoteric \"force\" tend to be more prominent in the West, where it has sometimes been associated with New Age spiritualism. These views are less prominent in modern communist China, where traditional Chinese medicine is often practiced and considered effective, but in which esoteric notions of qi are considered to contradict the secular nature of Marxist dialectic materialism. China's current government in fact formally embraces anti-spiritual atheism.  Many traditional martial arts schools also eschew a supernatural approach to the issue, identifying \"external qi\" or \"internal qi\" as representative of the varying leverage principles used to improve the efficacy of a well-trained, healthier than normal body with a given work load.\nSome complementary and alternative medicine approaches not only assume the existence of qi but believe that the purported subtle energy running through and surrounding the body can be manipulated so as to cultivate increased physical, psychological and spiritual health. Acupuncture, along with other practices of TCM, ayurveda, and many other traditional disciplines worldwide provide examples of similar beliefs.\n\n【7】 ## Scientific investigation\nModern science rejects the concept of \"qi\", but has considered explanations within known biological science. It has been hypothesized that the therapeutic effects of acupuncture can be explained by changes in nerve cells, to endorphin-release, to relaxation or by simple placebo effects. The NIH Consensus Statement on acupuncture in 1997 noted that concepts such as Qi \"are difficult to reconcile with contemporary biomedical information but continue to play an important role in the evaluation of patients and the formulation of treatment in acupuncture.\"\nIt is hypothesized that qi could be transmitted through the fascia independent of any neurological activity.\n\n【8】 #Interpretation in Japan and Korea\nIn the Japanese language, the Chinese character corresponding to qi (気) is pronounced ki.  The Japanese language contains over 11,442 known usages of \"ki\" as a compound. As a compound, it may represent syllables associated with the mind, the heart, feeling, the atmosphere, and flavor.\nWe see parallel development in Korean language usage as Koreans have long used Chinese characters (hanja) along side the indigenous Korean system (hangul). There are also some cases in which commonalities are due to the long history of their geographical relationship.\nThe character for \"ki\" in hangul is \"기\", which is pronounced as 'gi' with a hard g.\nJapanese usages of note also include tenki (weather 天気), genki (healthy, doing fine 元気), byouki (sick, sickness 病気) and kiai (spirit shout 気合 ).\nKorean compound usages of ki are also comparable including gibun (feeling, sensation 氣分) and gihap (spirit shout 氣合).\n\n【9】 #Qi in martial arts\nQi is a central concept in many Chinese, Korean and Japanese martial arts. While a traditional Neo-Confucian explanation of the principle is given in most martial art schools, many New Age-oriented or neo-ninja schools approach the subject from a more syncretist point of view, especially in the west.\nThe spiritual concept analogous to Chinese ki appears in the martial arts, such as Japanese aikido . The Korean system of hapkido, although a different martial art, shares the same characters as pre World War II aikido (合氣道). The character for 'ki' remained the same until 1946 when the character for ki was simplified in Japan. In hangul, the indigenous Korean system, hapkido would be rendered '합기도'.\n\n【10】 Most systems which incorporate the idea of ki believe that a practitioner may harness the energy stored in a special point in the lower stomach referred to as tan t'ien (丹田) in Chinese, tan den (丹田) in Japanese, tan jon (丹田 or 단전) in Korean and dan tian (ตันเถียน) in Thai, and utilize this energy in their martial technique, usually by employing special breathing techniques also found in the Buddhistic meditation practises common to these countries.\nMost long term or professional martial arts practitioners report that the practice of building qi via breathing exercises, deep relaxation and meditation practices causes profound physiological changes that enable special martial arts skills. After sufficient practice an ability to feel the qi develops. Sensations such as tingling, warmth and heaviness of the limbs are common. With continued practice the martial artist is able to gradually gain control of these sensations and invoke them at will. In T'ai Chi, for example, one goal is to \"sink\" or accumulate the qi to the navel area, experienced as a strong sensation of warmth and heaviness, similar to the sensation one feels when an elevator stops. After that, the ability to \"circulate\" the qi develops, where the martial artist feel warm waves of qi energy moving through the body in harmony with the graceful T'ai Chi movements. Practitioners able to experience these sensations find their sense of touch is enhanced, along with dramatically improved balance and coordination. These skills then enable improved martial arts performance.\n\n【11】 #Types of qi\n- Yuán qì - (primary qi)\n- Jing (TCM) - (nutrient qi)\n- Zhong Qi - (pectoral qi)\n- Wei Qi - (defensive qi)\n- Qigong - (qi cultivation)\n\n【12】 #Similar concepts in other cultures\nThe concept of a life-energy inherent in all living beings seems to be a fairly universal archetype, and appears in numerous ancient religions and systems of metaphysics (in addition to having been borrowed by George Lucas's Star Wars films with the concept of The Force).\nAnalogies concepts from other cultures include:\n- Polynesian mythology: mana - Australian Aboriginal mythology: maban\n- Egyptian mythology : ka - Finnish mythology: sisu\n- Greek mythology/Christianity: psykhe\n- Roman mythology/Christianity: spiritus\n- Hebrew mythology: nefesh\n- Inuit mythology: inua, sila - Leni Lenape mythology: manetuwak\n- Norse mythology: hugr\n- Druidry: Awen\n- Ghedee practice: mbec\nAlso related are the philosophical concepts of:\n- European alchemy and philosophy: aether, (or ether), quintessence\n- Hindu philosophy: prana\nRelated martial arts and exercise practices include\n- Indian culture: Yoga", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Other causes and management of abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) are outside of the scope of this guideline.\nThere are 2 major recognized categories of endometrial cancer: type 1 and type 2. Type 1 tumours are much more common (~80% of all cases) and are of lower histological grade. They are associated with estrogen excess and have a more favourable prognosis. Type 2 tumours are much less common and are of higher grade. They are not estrogen-related, and their prognosis is poorer. Endometrial cancer  represents 3% of all new cancer cases. The median age for diagnosis of endometrial cancer is 62 years, with 74% of cases diagnosed after the age 55. Only 7% are diagnosed before the age of 44, and 26% before the age of 54. 3 Risk Factors 1,2,4 Hormone-related factors:\n\n【1】 - Lifestyle management 2, 5 -physical activity, limiting sedentary behaviour, and weight loss can reduce risk of endometrial cancer. - Oral contraceptive use ,2,6, 7 -the use of oral contraceptives may reduce risk.\n- Hormone replacement therapy ,2, 4 -for postmenopausal females with an intact uterus, the use of hormone replacement therapy comprising of both estrogen and progesterone may reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia. Unopposed estrogen therapy should be avoided. - Hysterectomy 8, 9 -a hysterectomy is usually indicated for females with atypical endometrial hyperplasia because of high risk of progressing to cancer. Females who choose to retain their uterus should be managed on an individual basis under the direction of a gynecologist, This includes a personal or family history of colorectal, endometrial, ovarian, gastric, small bowel, hepatobiliary, pancreatic, kidney, ureter, sebaceous gland adenomas, brain tumours; or a history of one or more pathologically confirmed colorectal adenomas ≤ age 40\n\n【2】 #Screening 9 -12\nThere is currently no evidence that mortality is decreased by population-based screening for endometrial cancer, including for high-risk females (e.g. those with Lynch syndrome).\nA Pap test (also known as cervical cytology) is not a screening procedure for endometrial cancer.\nPatients with abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) require investigations. AUB, more specifically anovulatory bleeding and not ovulatory bleeding, is often associated with endometrial hyperplasia and cancer. Anovulatory bleeding is more common near menarche and perimenopause and is often irregular, heavy and prolonged.\n\n【3】 #Investigations 1, 9, 13\nA medical history and physical exam will often indicate the cause of AUB and determine the need for further testing.\nA medical history includes:\n- menses history and relevant symptoms (e.g. bleeding amount, frequency); - family history (e.g. Lynch syndrome); and - identifying risk factors (listed above).\n- speculum exam (and a Pap test if indicated, but a Pap test is not a diagnostic test for endometrial cancer); and - pelvic examination.\nIf clinically indicated, then bloodwork might include:\n- complete blood count (when heavy or prolonged bleeding);\n- pregnancy test (when pregnancy is possible);\n- thyroid function test (when suspicion of thyroid disease); or - coagulation test (when there is a personal or family history of AUB).\nIf other causes of AUB have been ruled out, and/or endometrial cancer is suspected, an endometrial biopsy and transvaginal ultrasound are the recommended initial diagnostic investigations. 1 Note that a normal endometrial thickness on ultrasound does not rule out endometrial cancer. Normal endometrium in a premenopausal woman varies in thickness from 4 mm in the follicular phase to 16 mm in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle.\nThose requiring endometrial biopsy include:\n- women aged < 40 years with AUB and identifiable risk factors (listed above);\n- women with significant intermenstrual bleeding; and - postmenopausal women who develop an unusual vaginal discharge in the absence of an identifiable vaginal cause.\nAn endometrial biopsy should be performed by either an experienced family physician or a community gynecologist.\nFor a patient with persistent AUB despite negative biopsy and transvaginal ultrasound results, consider hysteroscopic examination, ‡ The benchmark for an appointment at the BCCA is 2 weeks following referral; urgent cases may be seen sooner upon telephone consultation.\nSurgery is the mainstay of therapy following a tissue diagnosis. Patients with high-grade (i.e. grade 2 or 3), serous, malignant mixed Müllerian tumor (MMMT), or clear cell histologies should have their surgery performed by a gynecologic oncologist (if possible).\nMost patients with low-grade operable endometrial cancer will not need any additional post-surgical therapy.\nFor patients with high-grade or aggressive histology, or the presence of extra-uterine disease: chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy may be used.\nOnce the patient has completed treatment, she will be discharged from the BCCA. Upon discharge, the family physician may be asked to manage the patient's follow-up care.\nFollow-up care includes: 1 surveillance for recurrence or new cancer; 2 monitoring and treating complications and/or side effects from treatment; and 3 providing patient support.\nSpecific recommendations will be provided in the patient's discharge letter. At any time, the patient and/or family physician may consult with the BCCA regarding any follow-up questions or concerns.

There are a trillion endothelial cells in the body.\nCompromise of normal function of endothelial cells is characteristic of endothelial dysfunction. Normal functions of endothelial cells include mediation of coagulation, platelet adhesion, immune function, control of volume and electrolyte content of the intravascular and extravascular spaces.  Endothelial dysfunction can result from disease processes, as occurs in septic shock, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, diabetes as well as from environmental factors, such as from smoking tobacco products.\nEndothelial dysfunction is thought to be a key event in the development of atherosclerosis and predates clinically obvious vascular pathology by many years. Endothelial dysfunction has also been shown to be of prognostic significance in predicting vascular events including stroke and heart attacks.\nA key feature of endothelial dysfunction is the inability of arteries and arterioles to dilate fully in response to an appropriate stimulus. This can be tested by a variety of methods including iontophoresis of acetylcholine, intra-arterial administration of various vasoactive agents, localised heating of the skin and temporary arterial occlusion by inflating a blood pressure cuff to high pressures. Testing can also take place in the coronary arteries themselves but this is invasive and not normally conducted unless there is a clinal reason for intracoronary catheterisation. These techniques are thought to stimulate the endothelium to release nitric oxide (NO) and possibly some other agents, which diffuse into the surrounding vascular smooth muscle causing vasodilation.\nDysfunctional endothelial cells are unable to produce NO to the same extent (or there is increased and rapid destruction of NO) as healthy endothelial cells and therefore vasodilatation is reduced. This creates a detectable difference in subjects with endothelial dysfunction verses a normal, healthy endothelium.\nUnfortunately the variability in such tests means that no technique has yet been identified that would allow endothelial testing to attain routine clinical significance.\n\n【3】 #Acetylcholine\nNormal arteries vasodilate in response to acetylcholine, atherosclerotic arteries constrict.  Endotheilial function in response to exercise and mental stress is a measure endothelial health.  This effect is mediated by abnormalities in the endothelial cells.

Although the rule is sometimes thought to apply only to situations such as admissions made to a psychiatrist during treatment, this is only one case.  In some jurisdictions, conversations between a patient and physician may be privileged in both criminal and civil courts.\nFor example, a below-age of consent girl came to a doctor with a sexually transmitted disease.  The doctor is usually required to obtain a list of the patient's sexual contacts to inform them that they need treatment.  This is an important health concern.  However, the patient may be reluctant to divulge the names of her older sexual partners, for fear that they will be charged with statutory rape.  In some jurisdictions, the doctor cannot be forced to reveal the information revealed by his patient to anyone except to particular organisations, as specified by law, and they too are required to keep that information confidential.  If, in the case, the police become aware of such information, they are not allowed to use it in court as proof of the sexual conduct.\n\n【2】 #United States\nIn the United States, the Federal Rules of Evidence do not recognize doctor-patient privilege.\nAt the state level, the extent of the privilege varies depending on the law of the applicable jurisdiction. For example, in Texas there is only a limited physician-patient privilege in criminal proceedings, and the privilege is limited in civil cases as well003 and Texas Rules of Evidence, Rule 509(b).\n\n【3】 #Confidentiality post Tarasoff\nThe case of Tarasoff v. Regents of the University of California in 1974 was an important precedent; it transformed Physician-patient privilege in many parts of the world. In this case the therapist was sued for failing to warn a third person of his patient's desire to harm her. Thus, for many therapists, harm to others will trump confidentiality and a therapist can and has been held liable for failing to inform appropriate people if their client reveals a risk to self or if the client makes a specific threat against a specific, named person.\nEstablishing the boundaries of confidentiality is an important part of any relationship with a therapist.

{"seq_id": "112d010d-9499-4c3b-aabb-755ef5c1bc2f", "title": null, "text": "【0】 Dysfunctional uterine bleeding overview\n\n【1】 #Overview\nDysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB), often referred to as abnormal uterine bleeding, is an umbrella term used to define any abnormalities in uterine bleeding. Such abnormalities include menorrhagia, dysmenorrhea,  menometrorrhagia and inter-menstrual vaginal bleeding. Common causes of DUB include anatomical causes such  Polyp, adenomyosis, Leiomyoma and Malignancy or hyperplasia. Bleeding may also be due to non-structural causes such as Coagulopathy, ovulatory dysfunction, such as PCOS, endometrial disorders, such as endometriosis, as well as Iatrogenic causes.\n\n【2】 #Historical Perspective\nDysfunctional or abnormal uterine bleeding is a condition experienced by women of varying ages and from various geographical locations. Although there isn't much information available on dysfunctional uterine bleeding as it encompasses a multitude of possible underlying causes, there is some historical information available regarding some common causes. conditions that have significant historical information include Adenomyosis, Leiomyoma, uterine malignancy, PCOS, as well as endometriosis.\n\n【3】 #Classification\nDysfunctional uterine bleeding has multiple underlying causes but, at its root, the disease can be subdivided into ovulatory or anovulatory causes. Ovultaory bleeding occurs when there are underlying issues of ovulation. This may be due to ovarian dysfunction as well as hypothalamic axis disorders. Anovulatory causes are those that occur independent of ovulatory dysfunctions such as pregnancy, weight gain, endocrinopathies, and drugs. Idiopathic causes may also contribute to anovulatory dysfunctional uterine bleeding. Affected patients may affect with a range of uterine bleeding patterns such as menometrorrhagia, metrorrhagia, menorrhagia as well as inter menstrual spotting.\n\n【4】 #Pathophysiology\nDysfunctional uterine bleeding is a condition that affects many women worldwide, especially because it has a wide range of underlying causes. Bleeding can be acute or chronic. By understanding the pathophysiology of the causative conditions, one can understand the cause of dysfunctional uterine bleeding. These include polyps, adenomyosis, leiomyoma, malignancy or hyperplasia, coagulopathies, ovulatory dysfunction, endometrial disorders and iatrogenic causes. In ovulatory causes, unopposed estrogen and progesterone result in continued thickening and proliferation of the endometrium. Along with the effects of these hormones, hypoxia, inflammation and vasoconstriction result in shedding and subsequent scarring.\n\n【5】 #Causes\nUterine bleeding can be divided into anatomical or structural and non-structural causes. The anatomical causes include Polyp, adenomyosis, Leiomyoma and Malignancy or hyperplasia. The non-structural causes include Coagulopathy, Ovulatory dysfunction, such as PCOS, Endometrial disorders, such as endometriosis, and Iatrogenic causes. In some women, no underlying cause can be identifiedd. These women are thought to have abnormal bleeding due to causes not otherwise classified.\n\n【6】 #Differential diagnosis\nThere are many differential diagnosis' for dysfunctional uterine bleeding, many of them resulting in abnormal presentation of bleeding. Some prevalent conditions include anatomical or structural defects, coagulation disorders, pregnancy related complications, endometrial cancer and hyperplasia, as well as Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome.\n\n【7】 #Risk Factors\nDiseases presenting with dysfunctional uterine bleeding have a multitude of risk factors. Some that are commonly found in multiple conditions include those where estrogen exposure is uncontrolled and excessive. Some examples include early onset of menarche and late onset of menopause, obesity, anovulatory conditions such as PCOS, estrogen exclusive hormonal contraceptives and tamoxifen therapy for breast cancer. It is to be notes that smoking has actually resulted in a reduced risk of some disease, due to its anti-estrogenic causes. The efficacy of smoking in preventing DUB is questionable considering the multitude of other diseases such a behavioural activity results in. Although some conditions affected women of all ages, adenomyosis and malignancy were found to affect older woman.\n\n【8】 #Natural history, Complications and Prognosis\nDysfunctional uterine bleeding is an irregularity of the menstrual cycle that may affect the duration, frequency and blood volume. Normal cycles last around 24-38 days and average 5-80 mL of blood loss during this time. Commonly associated complications include infertility, anemia and the possibility of underlying endometrial malignancy. Generally, the prognosis is favourable, but may depend on underlying causes and treatment options. The amount of blood loss varies according to hormonal and non-hormonal medications, as well as with surgical interventions.\n\n【9】 #History and Symptoms\nAssessment of anovulatory DUB should always start with a good medical history and physical examination. Laboratory assessment of hemoglobin, luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), prolactin, T4, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), pregnancy (by βhCG), and androgen profile should also happen. More extensive testing might include an ultrasound and endometrial sampling. It is important to retrieve a complete history including menstrualhistory, sexual and reproductive history, drug history, family history, as well as social activities and hobbies. Assessment for symptoms of anemia should also be done as women can loose large volumes of blood often leading to iron deficiency anemia.\n\n【10】 #Physical Examination\nPhysical findings vary amongst patients but it is common to find pelvic and endocrine as well as skin changes. These include changes associated with underlying anemia such as pallor and a pale conjunctiva. Endocrine findings such as increased hair growth, clitoromegaly and acne may help diagnose underlying endocrine related causes of abnormal bleeding. In those experiencing uterine bleeding due to coagulopathies, signs of platelet deficiencies may be present, such as bruising and petechiae. An extensive physical examination may help in diagnosing the cause of abnormal uterine bleeding.\n\n【11】 #Laboratory Findings\nWomen afflicted with dysfunctional uterine bleeding commonly present with CBC changes, particularly changes in red blood cells\n\n【12】 #CT\nCT scans are not the primary modality of assessing for underlying causes, but it may show some changes. It may be difficult to differentiate polyps, adenomyosis and leiomyoma's from each other. CT can help asses for the presence of metastasis secondary to endometrial cancer.\n\n【13】 #MRI\nMRI is not commonly performed but it is considered the modality of choice for adenomyosis. Findings for other conditions may also be seen but may not be as reliable as other imaging studies. MRI can assist in furthering diagnosis metastasis.\n\n【14】 #Ultrasound\nUltrasonography, although not the most sensitive or specific imaging modality, is commonly the primary type of imaging done for patients with dysfunctional uterine bleeding. Transvaginal ultrasounds are more accurate compared to pelvic ultrasound, but pelvic ultrasound reveals certain pathologies, including uterine and adnexal masses, more clearly. Ultrasonography is a simple and easily available diagnostic method for PCOS.\n\n【15】 #Other Imaging Findings\nOther imaging findings include colour doppler, sonohysterography, hysterosalpingography, and nuclear imaging (PET scan). These imaging modalities have proven useful for diagnosing polyps, endometrioma's and adenomyosis.\n\n【16】 #Other Diagnostic Studies\nOther imaging findings include colour doppler, sonohysterography, hysterosalpingography, and nuclear imaging (PET scan). These imaging modalities have proven useful for diagnosing polyps, endometrioma's and adenomyosis.\n\n【17】 #Medical therapy\nThe treatment for dysfunctional uterine bleeding has often proven to be successful but it is important to considering underlying etiologies, desire for fertility as well as any other symptoms patients may be experiencing. Treatment should be trailored for patients according to these underlying factors. The primary modality of treatment is hormonal, but there are nonhomronal options as well. It is important to treat acute bleeding as it may be life-threatening. Hormonal medications must be avoided in elderly women due to the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and malignancy. Iatrogeniccauses should focus on treating the underlying causes.\n\n【18】 #Surgery\nSurgical procedures are reserved for patients that are unresponsive to medical treatment or those that do not desire fertility. Procedures can be specific according to underlying causes of dysfunctional bleeding as well as cancer stage. Common surgical interventions include hysterectomy, endometrial ablation and laparoscopic removal.\n\n【19】 #Primary Prevention\nThe goal of primary prevention is to prevent the occurrence of an illness or a disease before it occurs. Malignancy can be prevented by controlling estrogen exposure with hormonal medications.\n\n【20】 #Secondary Prevention\nSecondary prevention occurs once the disease has developed and aims to prevent progression and development of further complications. Complications due to abnormal uterine bleeding include infertility, anemia, and malignancy.\n\n【21】 #Cost-Effectiveness of Therapy\nWomen are subjected to increased financial burden to treat underlying abnormal uterine bleeding. Annually, they loose USD $2,000.00 on account of work absences. Hormonal medications range from USD $172.00 for contraceptive pills, USD $930.00 for levonorgestrel IUD and upwards of USD $30,000.00 for hysterectomies.\n\n【22】 #Future or Investigational Therapies\nAbnormal uterine bleeding has been found to affect a multitude of women, ranging from menarche to menopause. It can often result in conditions that affect an individual's daily routine and personal life, such as anemia and infertility. Because of such complications, it is important to continue researching and studying the causes of abnormal bleeding and providing further knowledge. Due to the prevalence and high cost associated with surgical treatment of underlying causes, treatment must be tailored to the individual woman. Biomarkers continue to be studied and may provide crucial information. Future studied regarding  progesterone antagonists and progesterone receptor modulators are also being studied and may proove helpful in future therapy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

All available COVID-19 vaccines approved in Canada can be used during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Presently, preference is given for the use of mRNA vaccinations during pregnancy as more data on safety and efficacy during pregnancy is available for these vaccines.prioritize for pregnant and breastfeeding individuals. 4. Individuals should not be precluded from vaccination based on pregnancy status or breastfeeding. 5. Given that pregnant people are at increased risk of morbidity from COVID-19 infection, all pregnant persons should be prioritized to receive a COVID-19 vaccination. Vaccinations are an important part of primary and preventative healthcare for pregnant women. The benefit of vaccination during pregnancy for the infant (e.g. pertussis and influenza) is recognized and recommendation of these vaccinations is part of routine prenatal care.Compared to non-pregnant women with COVID-19, pregnant women are at increased risk of admission to hospital, critical care and invasive ventilation compared to age-matched peers. 1,2 Canadian and international data from large studies spanning multiple jurisdictions demonstrate that approximately 7-11% of pregnant women will require hospitalization for COVID-related morbidity and between 1-4% of pregnant women require admission to an intensive care unit (ICU). 1,2,3 Recently, a prospective cohort study of 5183 pregnant women compared to 175 905 non-pregnant women demonstrated that pregnancy conferred an increased risk of death from COVID-19 ( 1.84,). The risk of severe morbidity from COVID-19 in pregnant women appears to be associated with risk factors including age ≥ 35 years old, asthma, obesity, preexisting diabetes, preexisting hypertension and heart disease. 1,2 In addition, both Canadian and US data 1,2,3 show an increased risk of preterm delivery associated with COVID-19 infection in pregnancy which can result in consequent morbidity to the infant related to prematurity\n\n【1】 #COVID-19 vaccines approved for use in Canada mRNA Vaccine Platforms\nIn Canada, the dominant vaccines in use to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2 are the mRNA vaccine platforms. This model consists of messenger RNA (mRNA) encapsulated by a lipid nanoparticle (LNP), which allows the mRNA entrance into host (human) cells. The mRNA in the vaccine codes for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein utilized by the virus to bind to human receptors and promote viral replication. The vaccine provides the host cell instructions to manufacture only this spike protein and express it on its surface. Recognizing the spike protein as a foreign antigen, the host immune system is then activated to produce an immune response. 4 The mRNA does not enter the nucleus or alter human DNA and human cells do not have the machinery to allow it to do so.\nThe Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines were originally evaluated in licensure trials as a series of two intramuscular injections given 21-28 days apart. 5 However, since then, considerable data has been generated on different dosing intervals. 6 The efficacy of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine has been demonstrated for adults 16 years and older in Phase II and Phase III trials involving the randomization of approximately 44,000 individuals. 7 These trials demonstrated a vaccine efficacy of 94.6% for preventing symptomatic COVID-19 cases at least 7 days following the second dose. 7 In Phase III trials for the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine involving the randomization of 30,000 individuals, the vaccine was reported to have 94.1% efficacy against symptomatic COVID-19 with no serious safety concerns identified during the initial 2 month follow-up period. 8 Since the initial clinical trials, numerous population-based studies have reported on real-world vaccine efficacy. Among these, Canadian data from Quebec and British Columbia have demonstrated vaccine efficacy greater than 80-90% for infection for at least 4 months after the 2 nd dose and including against infections with Delta variant. 6,9 Vaccine efficacy data specific to pregnant women are emerging and suggest that COVID-19 mRNA vaccine efficacy is comparable to the vaccine efficacy observed in non-pregnant persons. 10,11 In Phase III trials for both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines, there were no clinically meaningful differences in adverse events or severe adverse events in the vaccine group compared to control except for lymphadenopathy which occurred in approximately 0.3% of the vaccine group compared to <0.1% of the placebo group for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. The most reported side effects from the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines were pain at the injection site, fatigue and headache. Fever was reported in 11-16% of patients, particularly following the second dose. 7 Data from the US vsafe pregnancy registry demonstrates that pregnant women are more likely than non-pregnant women to report injection site pain following administration of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, but are less likely to report headache, myalgia, chills and fever. 12 While pregnant and breastfeeding individuals were excluded from the available Phase II and Phase III studies for the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines a growing body of data demonstrates no difference in rates of spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, preterm birth or other pregnancy complications. The V-Safe registry in the US has reported on over 7,000 pregnant women (including a robust representation of women vaccinated in early pregnancy) who received either the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine or the Moderna vaccine and identified no differences in the rates of adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes in vaccinated women compared to pre-pandemic rates. 11,12 Additional US data from the University of Washington, demonstrated that COVID-19 vaccination in pregnant and lactating individuals can induce an immunogenic response, does not raise significant vaccine-related adverse events or obstetrical and neonatal outcomes, and is effective in preventing COVID-19 disease. 13,14 Most recently, analyses of US and Norwegian population-level data reporting on 105,446 and 18,477 pregnancies, respectively, have demonstrated no evidence of increased risk for early pregnancy loss following Covid-19 vaccination. 15,16 Canadian data on vaccines in pregnancy are now available from Ontario and have been published as 2 online reports.  Ontario. COVID-19 Vaccination During Pregnancy in Ontario: Surveillance Report\n\n【2】 #, Reporting Interval December 14, 2020 to June 30, 2021. Ottawa, ON: BORN Ontario; July 30, 2021. During this entire reporting period, there were 39,985 women who received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy. Of note 26,381 had received 1 dose and 13,604 had received 2 doses. Monthly uptake of vaccines increased over this time period from 0.02% to 45.4% by June 2021. There was no evidence of any pregnancy specific increase in any risks associated with vaccine uptake. whose objective is to assess the safety and effectiveness of vaccination against COVID-19 in pregnancy (registration is open and available on the website: /). Data on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in lactating women or the effects of mRNA vaccines on the breastfed infant or on milk production is limited, however because mRNA vaccines are not live virus vaccines, they are not hypothesized to be a risk to the breastfeeding infant. 17\n\n【3】 #Recently approved vaccine platforms\nIn early 2022, two new vaccines platforms were approved for use in Canada. Novavax Nuvaxovid contains a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein vaccine and Medicago Covifenz contains a plant-based virus-like particle of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The adjuvants contained in both vaccine platforms are oil-in-water emulsion adjuvants that have been used widely and in diverse populations including pregnant women and children, most notably during the 2009-2010 H1N1 influenza pandemic. 18 Both vaccine platforms use technology that is well established and used for other vaccines that are administered safely to pregnant women (e.g. hepatitis, pertussis and tetanus vaccines). There is no theoretical reason why the Novavax Nuvaxois or the Medicago Covifenz vaccines should not be administered to pregnant or lactating women, although safety and efficacy data specific to pregnancy is not yet available. 19,20 Following informed discussion, these vaccines could be considered as an alternative for pregnant and lactating women who cannot use the mRNA vaccine platform due to side effects or those who are opposed to using an mRNA vaccine platform.\n\n【4】 #Considerations for COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy\nDecades of experience with other vaccines administered during pregnancy would suggest that we could expect a similar efficacy for the COVID-19 vaccines in pregnant women compared to non-pregnant women. Vaccines in general are immunogenic, safe, and efficacious when delivered to pregnant persons. Recently COVID-19 vaccination has been shown to be efficacious in preventing infection in pregnant women. 21 While further primary prospective clinical data on safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in pregnant populations is forthcoming, growing post-marketing surveillance has identified no signals for adverse pregnancy or neonatal outcomes associated with administration of COVID-19 vaccinations.\nWhat is known is that an unvaccinated pregnant woman remains at risk of COVID-19 infection and remains at heightened risk of severe morbidity if infected compared to non-pregnant counterparts. Severe infection with COVID-19 carries risks to maternal, fetal and neonatal health. While pregnancy itself does not appear to increase the risk of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2, pregnant individuals may be in work-related (e.g. health-care worker, front line workers etc.) or community situations (e.g. caregiver, Indigenous communities, outbreak setting, etc.) where the risk of infection is considerable. Owing to maternal age, underlying comorbidities, or social marginalization, some pregnant individuals are at higher risk of severe COVID-related morbidity.\n\n【5】 #We recommend pregnant individuals should be offered vaccination against COVID-19 at any time during pregnancy or while breastfeeding, if no contraindications exist. This recommendation extends to those who have previously been infected with SARS-CoV-2. 22\nIn Canada, NACI has preferentially advised that \"a complete vaccine series with an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine should be offered to individuals in the authorized age group who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Informed consent should include discussion about emerging evidence on the safety of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines in these populations. (Strong NACI Recommendation). Contraindications to vaccination are few and a complete description is available within the National Advisory Committee on Immunization guidance document. 23\n\n【6】 #Anticipatory guidance for vaccination during pregnancy\nIndividuals should be informed of the expected side effects following vaccination. While pain at the injection site, fatigue and headache are the most commonly reported symptoms following vaccination, fever was reported 16% of the time for younger, non-pregnant individuals. 8 Pregnant individuals can be counselled to treat mild post-vaccination fevers with antipyretics (e.g. acetaminophen).\n\n【7】 #Timing of vaccination during pregnancy and neonatal protection\nThe primary indication for administration of COVID-19 vaccination is for maternal protection. Therefore the decision around timing of vaccination should be optimized for maternal benefit. In theory, immunization of a pregnant woman may confer benefit to a newborn infant through a mechanism of maternal vaccination similar to what is seen for pertussis and influenza vaccination during pregnancy. While natural COVID-19 infection does appear to result in placental antibody transfer, vaccination negates the fundamental risk of COVID-19 in pregnancy while conferring the same neonatal benefit. 24 Evidence demonstrates that vaccine-generated antibodies are present in umbilical cord blood following maternal vaccination with a rapid rise in titres occurring by 15d post-vaccination. 14,25 There appears to be efficient antibody transfer via the placenta, similar to pertussis vaccination which does confer neonatal protection. 14,25,26,27 Recent data from a case-control study conducted by the US-CDC demonstrates that receipt of a two-dose series of a mRNA COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy is associated with a reduction in COVID-associated infant hospitalizations <6 months. 28 In general maternal antibody transfer via the placenta is a more efficient way to confer neonatal protection than breastfeeding. Antibodies are also transferred to breast milk post vaccination, 29,30,31,32,33,34 but there is yet no data on associated neonatal protection.\n\n【8】 #Vaccine Spacing\nThere is no clear evidence to direct whether spacing of other vaccines is required, relative to the COVID-19 vaccine. Recently NACI has changed its recommendation to support simultaneous vaccination of COVID-19 with any other vaccine. This is uniquely applicable to pregnant persons in that there is no required delay of any vaccine (e.g. Tdap or influenza vaccination) or Rh-immunoglobulin for COVID-19 vaccination and vice versa. Of note, pregnant women and infants remain at increased risk of morbidity and mortality from seasonal influenza compared to general population and vaccinating pregnant women against influenza remains part of routine prenatal care during the pandemic.\n\n【9】 #Vaccination of the pregnant patient in the context of limited vaccine supply\nGiven that pregnant women are at higher risk of severe COVID-related morbidity and mortality, they represent a population that should be prioritized for vaccination in situations where vaccine supply is limited. Specifically, the WHO has recommended that pregnant women be prioritized in stage II, representing a situation where the supply is only sufficient to immunize 11-20% of a population. Importantly, the WHO recommendation is upheld in all epidemiologic situations including community transmission, sporadic cases as well as no cases. 35\n\n【10】 #Inadvertent pregnancy following vaccination\nIndividuals who are discovered to be pregnant during their vaccine series or shortly afterward should not be counselled to terminate pregnancy based on having received the vaccine. If conception is presumed to predate the first dose, it is recommended to follow the same procedures for active surveillance (as available) as would be activated if the pregnancy was known at the time of vaccination. A registry to track pregnancy outcomes for individuals receiving any vaccine doses during pregnancy is being planned for Canada\nWhere pregnancy is detected during the vaccine series (i.e. following the first dose, but ahead of the second dose), pregnant individuals should continue to be offered the opportunity to complete their vaccination series. Pregnant individuals should not be precluded or forced to delay the vaccine series in any trimester.\n\n【11】 #Individuals contemplating pregnancy\nIdeally, an individual would be immunized against COVID-19 ahead of pregnancy to benefit from maximal vaccine efficacy throughout the entire pregnancy. There is no reason to delay pregnancy upon receipt of vaccination.\n\n【12】 #Booster doses\nPregnant women mount immune responses comparable to the non-pregnant population and vaccine efficacy of the COVID vaccines among cohorts of pregnant women are comparable to non-pregnant women. There is no data to suggest that pregnant women who meet criteria for a booster dose should be treated differently than the non-pregnant population. While timing and criteria for booster doses may vary by jurisdiction, pregnant women should receive a booster dose when recommended.\n\n【13】 #Future research\nAs the evidence evolves, it is becoming clear that pregnant and postpartum individuals represent a population at increased risk of COVID-related morbidity. Severe COVID-19 infection during pregnancy has important implications for both maternal and fetal health. NACI acknowledges that people of reproductive age constitute a substantial proportion of the Canadian population, yet limited data on the use of COVID-19 vaccine in pregnancy are available. We support NACI's recommendation for the inclusion of pregnant individuals in clinical trials of COVID-19 vaccines. This will help to ensure that this population has equitable access to COVID-19 vaccine options, and that vaccination decisions can be informed by robust safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy data.

The movements, which are involuntary and sometimes painful, may affect a single muscle; a group of muscles such as those in the arms, legs, or neck; or the entire body. Those with dystonia usually have normal intelligence and no associated psychiatric disorders.\n\n【2】 #What are the symptoms of Dystonia?\nDystonia can affect many different parts of the body.\nSymptoms  may include:\n- deterioration in handwriting after writing several lines\n- foot cramps\n- tendency of one foot to pull up or drag; this may occur \"out of the blue\" or may occur after running or walking some distance.\n- the neck may turn or pull involuntarily, especially when the patient is tired or stressed.\n- both eyes may sometimes blink rapidly and uncontrollably, rendering a person functionally blind\n- tremor - voice or speech difficulties, possibly with a hoarse voice\n- Tiredness and soreness due to the excessive muscle contractions\nThe initial symptoms can be very mild and may be noticeable only after prolonged exertion, stress, or fatigue. Over a period of time, the symptoms may become more noticeable and widespread and be unrelenting. Sometimes, however, there is little or no progression.\nDystonias are sometimes classified according to the parts of the body they affect:\n- Generalized dystonia affects most or all of the body.\n- Multifocal dystonia involves two or more unrelated body parts.\n- Hemidystonia involves the arm and leg on the same side of the body.\n\n【3】 #What causes Dystonia?\nIt is not exactly clear what causes dystonias.  There are two types of dystonia: acquired dystonia and idiopathic dystonia.\nAcquired dystonia, also called secondary dystonia, results from environmental or disease-related damage to the basal ganglia. Birth injury (particularly due to lack of oxygen), certain infections, reactions to certain drugs, heavy-metal or carbon monoxide poisoning, trauma, or stroke can cause dystonic symptoms. Dystonias can also be symptoms of other diseases, some of which may be hereditary.\nAbout half the cases of dystonia have no connection to disease or injury and are called primary or idiopathic dystonia. Of the primary dystonias, many cases appear to be inherited in a dominant manner; i.e. only one carrier parent need contribute the dystonia gene for the disease to occur, each child having a 50% chance of being a carrier. In dystonia, however, a carrier may or may not develop a dystonia and the symptoms may vary widely even among members of the same family. The product of one defective gene appears to be sufficient to cause the chemical imbalances that may lead to dystonia; but the possibility exists that another gene or genes and environmental factors may play a role.  Researchers have identified more than 15 different genetic mutations that may contribute to dystonia.\nWhether you have acquired or idiopathic dystonia, researchers think that it is caused by a problem in the part of the brain that handles messages about muscle contractions.  Scientists suspect a defect in the body's ability to process a group of chemicals called neurotransmitters, which help cells in the brain communicate with each other.\nOne of the most important characteristics is the failure of reciprocal inhibition, a normal process in which muscles with opposite actions work without opposing each other. In dystonia, the tightening of muscles is associated with an abnormal pattern of muscles fighting each other.  The search for the gene or genes responsible for some forms of dominantly inherited dystonias continues.\n\n【4】 #Who is at highest risk?\nDifferent dystonias are caused by different factors.  Those who have a family history of idiopathic dystonia have a higher risk of inheriting it. Some cases of primary dystonia may have different types of hereditary patterns. Knowing the pattern of inheritance can help families understand the risk of passing dystonia along to future generations.\n\n【5】 #When to seek urgent medical care?\nCall your doctor is you are having any type of involuntary muscle contractions, even if they are mild or occur irregularly.\n\n【6】 #Diagnosis\nA visit to your primary care physician may be helpful  After your visit, s/he may refer you to a neurologist.\nAt your appointment, you will be asked to provide a medical and family history.  You may also be asked to provide a urine sample or blood sample to determine if you’ve had exposure to toxins.  Your doctor will want to know when your symptoms started, the nature of your symptoms, whether you’ve had a stroke or head injury, and if you you’ve been exposed to certain drugs or toxins.\nIt is also possible that your doctor will want you to have a magnetic resonance imaging  scan to determine if you have evidence of a stroke, tumor, or other lesion.\n\n【7】 #Treatment options\nThere is no cure, and no one treatment has been found universally effective.  Instead, doctors use medicines, surgery, physical therapy and other treatments to reduce or eliminate muscle spasms and pain.\n- Medication- Several classes of drugs that may help correct imbalances in neurotransmitters have been found useful. But response to drugs varies among patients and even in the same person over time. Some patients who have a specific form of dystonia may experience considerable relief by taking levodopa, a drug that the body uses to synthesize the nerve chemical dopamine. Drugs that interfere with another neurochemical, acetylcholine (which stimulates muscle movements), may also be effective.  The most effective therapy is often individualized, with physicians prescribing several types of drugs at different doses to treat symptoms and produce the fewest side effects.\n- Botulinum toxin- Minute amounts of this familiar toxin can be injected into affected muscles to provide temporary relief of focal dystonias. First used to treat blepharospasm, such injections have gained wider acceptance among physicians for treating other focal dystonias. The toxin stops muscle spasms by blocking release of the excitatory neurotransmitter acetylcholine. The effect lasts for up to several months before the injections have to be repeated.\n- Deep brain stimulation (DBS)– The electrical stimulation of very small regions of brain tissue by surgically implanted electrodes is effective for some people with dystonia. DBS has reduced the use of older, usually less effective forms of surgery that create permanent damage to the nervous system.\nSome patients with spasmodic dysphonia may benefit from treatment by a speech-language pathologist. Physical therapy, splinting, stress management, and biofeedback may also help individuals with certain forms of dystonia\n\n【8】 #Where to find medical care for Dystonia?\nDirections to Hospitals Treating Dystonia\n\n【9】 #What to expect (Outlook/Prognosis)?\nThe initial symptoms can be very mild and may be noticeable only after prolonged exertion, stress, or fatigue. Dystonias often progress through various stages. Initially, dystonic movements are intermittent and appear only during voluntary movements or stress. Later, individuals may show dystonic postures and movements while walking and ultimately even while they are relaxed.\nResponse to treatment is different for every person, and can even change for a person over time.\n\n【10】 #Possible complications\nIn some patients, dystonic motions may lead to permanent physical deformities by causing tendons to shorten.  Dystonia can also make everyday activities more difficult and can even cause functional blindness if your dystonia affects your eyelids.  Additionally, surgeries carry many risks which should be discussed with your doctor if you are considering surgical treatment.\nDystonia is often misunderstood by other people who assume that the dystonic movements are caused by mental retardation or other mental disorder. Unfortunately, the difficulties that come along with dystonia can cause patients to feel depressed and frustrated by their condition.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

The evidence used to support these recommendations was mainly from observational studies that used the prior Masaoka and Masaoka-Koga staging systems. Given the lack of randomized trials, the Working Group endorsed most of the consensus-based recommendations from the previous version of this guideline  . For patients with thymic NETS, recommendations were endorsed from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Version 1.2021 Neuroendocrine and Adrenal Tumors Guideline.\nGeneral Principles 1. The aim of surgery in all cases is to achieve a complete resection. 2. The TNM staging system should be used for all patients. 3. Discussion of all patients at multidisciplinary cancer conference (MCC) is strongly recommended, not just at local MCC but also with higher-volume centres. Presentation at the International Thymic Malignancies Interest Group tumour board should be considered.\n\n【3】 #IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS\nThe Working Group members believed that patients in rural areas or patients who are disadvantaged may find it more challenging to attend daily PORT treatments or treatments in high-volume centres since they may live further away from these centres in Ontario or may have difficulty in acquiring transportation for daily treatments than patients in urban areas or patients who are less disadvantaged. Also, peptide receptor radionuclide therapy has not been approved for patients with thymic epithelial tumours in Ontario.\n\n【4】 #FURTHER RESEARCH\nLarger, collaborative, international prospective trials that control for confounders are needed to provide a greater degree of certainty in the evidence to inform recommendations.\n\n【5】 #GUIDELINE LIMITATIONS\nThe Working Group for this guideline did not include patient representatives. Thus, when developing recommendations, input from patients about their values and preferences was not sought and a systematic review for this information was not performed. Working Group members used their prior clinical experiences with patients with thymic epithelial tumours to assume their relevant values and preferences.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

It is not intended to be a manual or \"how to\" guide, but rather a tool to guide best practices and enhance decision-making for nurses G working with clients G who use tobacco. The guideline should be reviewed and applied in accordance with both the needs of the individual organizations or practice settings, and the needs and preferences of the person. In addition, the guideline provides an overview of appropriate structures and supports for providing the best possible evidence-based care.\nNurses, other health-care providers, and administrators who lead and facilitate practice changes will find this document invaluable for developing policies, procedures, protocols, educational programs, assessments, interventions, and documentation of tools. Nurses and other health-care providers in direct care will benefit from reviewing the recommendations and the evidence that supports them. We particularly recommend that practice settings adopt the recommendations in this guideline in formats that are user-friendly for daily use.\nIf your organization is adopting this guideline, we recommend that you follow these steps:\n- Assess your health-care practices using the recommendations in this guideline.\n- Identify which recommendations will address needs or gaps in services.\n- Develop a plan for implementing the recommendations. Implementation resources, including RNAO's Toolkit:\nImplementation of Best Practice Guidelines ,2nd ed.\nWe are interested in hearing how you have implemented this guideline\n\n【2】 #BAC K G R O U N D\nIntegrating Tobacco Interventions into Daily Practice -Third Edition\n\n【3】 #Purpose and Scope\nBest Practice Guidelines (BPG) are systematically developed statements designed to assist health-care providers working in partnership with clients and their families as they make decisions about healthcare and services . This BPG replaces the RNAO Best Practice Guideline Integrating Smoking Cessation into Daily Nursing Practice . It is to be used by nurses and other members of the inter-professional health-care team G to enhance the quality G of their practice pertaining to clients who use commercial tobacco, ultimately improving clinical outcomes through the use of evidence-based practices.\nIn February 2015, an inter-professional expert panel convened and established the purpose and scope of this guideline. The purpose is to provide tobacco interventions best practices for nurses and other health-care providers across all care settings, with evidence-based recommendations related to assessment and interventions for adults who use tobacco. The scope includes all forms of commercial tobacco and is not limited to smoking alone-thus, the guideline's name changed from \"smoking cessation G \" to \"tobacco interventions. \"\nThe recommendations will help nurses and other health-care providers gain the knowledge required to screen all clients for tobacco use, implement an intervention plan with individuals who use tobacco, treat or refer clients, add tobacco use content to enhance health professional education programs, ensure tobacco intervention curriculum is facilitated by trained and skilled educators, and advocate for smoke-and vape-free policies in health-care delivery settings and in the community. This guideline applies to all domains of nursing practice, including clinical, administration, and education.\nThis guideline provides best practice recommendations in three main areas:\n Practice recommendations G are directed primarily to nurses and other health-care providers on the interprofessional teams who provide direct care to people in health system settings (e.g. acute care, long-term care, and home healthcare) and in the community (e.g. primary care and public health). Practice recommendations are formulated and presented according to the nursing process G.\n Education recommendations G are directed to those responsible for staff and student education, such as educators, quality improvement teams, managers, administrators, and academic and professional institutions.\n System, organization, and policy recommendations G apply to a variety of audiences, depending on the recommendation. Audiences include direct care nurses and other health-care providers, managers, administrators, policy-makers, nursing regulatory bodies, academic institutions, and government bodies.\nFor optimal effectiveness, recommendations in these three areas should be implemented together to improve tobacco interventions and to enhance the inter-professional team's ability to partner for the purpose of improving health. It is acknowledged that competencies associated with tobacco intervention education may vary among nurses and other health-care providers within inter-professional teams.\nVarious factors will affect the application of tobacco education practices as outlined in this guideline. These include individual organizations' policies and procedures, government legislation, and the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of the adult accessing care and services.\n\n【4】 #BAC K G R O U N D\nIntegrating Tobacco Interventions into Daily Practice -Third Edition\n\n【5】 #Interpretation of Evidence\nLevels of evidence are assigned to study designs to rank how well particular designs are able to eliminate alternative explanations of the phenomena under study. The higher the level of evidence, the greater the likelihood that the relationships presented among the variables are true. Levels of evidence do not reflect the merit or quality of individual studies.\nFor guideline recommendations, where available, studies with the highest level of evidence that most closely align with the recommendation statement are referenced. Where multiple studies report similar findings, only studies with the highest level of evidence are cited.\nOn occasion, guideline recommendations are assigned more than one level of evidence. This is a reflection of the varied study designs that support the multiple components of a recommendation. For transparency, the individual levels of evidence for each component of the recommendation statement are identified in the Discussion of Evidence. Additionally, as part of the systematic review G , studies are appraised for quality with an assigned ranking of strong, moderate, or weak. Where available, in addition to the highest level of evidence, only strong or moderate quality studies are cited to support recommendations\n\n【6】 #LEVEL SOURCE OF EVIDENCE\nEvidence obtained from meta-analysis G or systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials G and/or synthesis of multiple studies primarily of quantitative research.\nEvidence obtained from at least one randomized controlled trial.\nSource: Adapted from the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN, 2011) and Pati .\n\n【7】 #BAC K G R O U N D\nIntegrating Tobacco Interventions into Daily Practice -Third Edition\n\n【8】 #Summary of Recommendations\nThis guideline replaces the RNAO BPG Integrating Smoking Cessation into Daily Nursing Practice (2007b).\nWe have used these symbols for the recommendations:\nNo change was made to the recommendation as a result of the systematic review evidence.\nThe recommendation and supporting evidence were updated following the systematic review.\nNEW A new recommendation was developed following the systematic review.\n\n【9】 #LEVEL OF EVIDENCE STATUS\n- 0 Assessment Recommendation 1.1:\nUse brief interventions to screen all clients for all forms of tobacco use and initiate intervention as appropriate.\nIa, Ib  2.0 Planning Recommendation 2.1:\nDevelop a person-centred tobacco intervention plan with the client.\nV  3.0 Implementation Recommendation 3.1:\nProvide clients with, or refer them to, intensive interventions and counselling on the use of pharmacotherapy, if they use tobacco and express an interest in reducing or quitting their tobacco use.\n\n【10】 #Recommendation 3.2:\nTreat or refer all pregnant or postpartum women at every encounter for intensive behavioural counselling for tobacco harm reduction, cessation, and relapse prevention, in conjunction with nicotine replacement therapy, on a case by case basis.\nIa, Ib, V  4.0 Evaluation Recommendation 4.1:\nEvaluate the effectiveness of the intervention plan until the client's goals are met.\n\n【11】 #Stakeholder Acknowledgment\nAs a component of the guideline development process for best practice guidelines , RNAO is committed to obtaining feedback from nurses and other health-care providers from a wide range of practice settings and roles, knowledgeable administrators and funders of health-care services, and stakeholder G associations. Reviewers may be nurses and other point-of-care health-care providers, nurse executives, administrators, research experts, members of inter-professional teams, educators, nursing students, or patients. RNAO aims to solicit stakeholder expertise and perspectives representing diverse health-care sectors, roles within nursing and other professions (e.g. clinical practice, research, education, and policy), and geographic locations.\nStakeholder reviewers for RNAO guidelines are identified in two ways.\nReviewers are asked to read a full draft of the guideline and participate in the review prior to its publication. Stakeholders submit their feedback by completing an online questionnaire. Stakeholders are asked the following questions about each recommendation:\n Is this recommendation clear?\n Do you agree with this recommendation?\n Does this recommendation apply to all roles, regions, and practice settings?\n\n【12】 The RNAO guideline development team compiles the submissions and prepares a summary of the feedback. The RNAO expert panel reviews and considers all feedback and, if necessary, modifies the content and recommendations in the guideline prior to publication to address the feedback\n\n【13】 #BAC K G R O U N D\nIntegrating Tobacco Interventions into Daily Practice -Third Edition\n\n【14】 #Tobacco Definition and Types of Tobacco\nIn this guideline, \"tobacco\" refers to all smoking and smokeless forms of commercial tobacco products, including but not limited to cigarettes, cigars, cigarillos, chewing tobacco, dissolvables, hookah/water pipe/shisha, snuff, rollyour-own cigarettes, and pipes, as well as other products that may contain nicotine, such as electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) . It does not include therapeutic uses of tobacco and nicotine, such as traditional ceremonial use and nicotine replacement therapy. Health-care providers must be aware of the different forms tobacco products come in, so they can provide effective interventions for clients,\nCommercial cigarettes are thin cylinders of finely cut tobacco wrapped in special paper for smoking. Commercial cigarettes are manufactured by companies and sold in stores. The purchase of these cigarettes is often taxed.\n\n【15】 Cigars are aged tobacco wrapped in tobacco leaf and can contain as much tobacco as a whole standard pack of cigarettes. Cigars often take one to two hours to smoke (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2016).\n\n【16】 #Chewing Tobacco\nChewing tobacco is strips of loose-leaf tobacco placed between the gums and cheek, so the nicotine can be absorbed through the buccal mucosa. Chewing tobacco is usually aged and sweetened or flavoured. The accumulated saliva is spit out (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2016).\nDissolvables include items that resemble candy and are often flavoured. They may be in the form of wafers, lozenges, sticks, strips, and orbs (World Lung Foundation, 2015).\n\n【17】 #BAC K G R O U N D\nIntegrating Tobacco Interventions into Daily Practice -Third Edition\n\n【18】 #TYPE OF TOBACCO PRODUCT DESCRIPTION\nA hookah is a water pipe that allows users to smoke tobacco that is available in different flavours, such as mint, cherry, and watermelon. Hookah originated in the Middle East, and using it is often a social activity among a group of individuals. Hookah is also called shisha. Individuals who use hookah are exposed to the same health risks as individuals who smoke cigarettes (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2016).\nSnuff is finely ground tobacco that may be either moist or dry and that often comes in different flavours. It is sold in cans or pouches.\nMoist snuff is spit free and is placed between the cheek and gum. Nicotine is absorbed through the buccal mucosa. Moist snuff products are also known as snus, khaini, shammaah, nass, or naswa .\nDry snuff is finely ground into powder form and inhaled through the nose, where nicotine is quickly absorbed (American Cancer Society, 2016).\n\n【19】 #Roll-Your-Own Cigarettes\nRoll-your-own .\nPipes are smoking devices made of briar wood, slate, or clay. Tobacco flakes are placed in the wider opening of the pipe and burned, with the smoke passed through the stem and inhaled through the narrower opening .\n\n【20】 #Electronic Cigarettes\nElectronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) contain a liquid mixture of propylene glycol (PG), vegetable glycerin (VG), and water. They may or may not contain nicotine. When the internal battery element is heated, a vapour is produced, which is inhaled. This is referred to as \"vaping\" (American Cancer Society, 2016).\n\n【21】 #BAC K G R O U N D\nIntegrating Tobacco Interventions into Daily Practice -Third Edition\nThe health-care field of tobacco interventions is ever changing and prevention, reduction, and cessation efforts, along with managing withdrawal symptoms for clients, must remain responsive to this complex and evolving landscape. One aspect that continues to grow in complexity is the availability of a wide range of alternative products. For example, the use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) remains controversial, as there is insufficient evidence on their safety and efficacy as a harm-reduction tool. There has also been an increase in hookah (water pipe) use, with misconceptions around its safety. In addition, there has been a global increase in the use of cigarillos, and an increased use of roll-your-own tobacco, as it is a cheaper and less taxed form of tobacco.\nTobacco consumption is on the rise globally, with approximately 5.8 trillion .\nBased on current tobacco use rates, the 21st century will see one billion tobacco-related deaths globally (World Lung Foundation, 2015). The impact of tobacco use on public health remains extremely high. Furthermore, there are direct and indirect health-care costs as the use of tobacco is also a risk factor for serious acute and chronic illnesses, including cancer, stroke, and heart and lung diseases. In Canada, the health and economic costs associated with tobacco use are estimated to total $17 billion annually, including $4.4 billion in direct health-care costs (Government of Canada, 2016).\n\n【22】 #BAC K G R O U N D\nIntegrating Tobacco Interventions into Daily Practice -Third Edition Health-care providers themselves may use tobacco. Although health-care organizations should focus their efforts on tobacco interventions to clients, staff should have access to counselling and pharmacotherapy G. Personal tobacco use status should not deter health-care providers from providing support to clients.\nTo help readers better understand the harmful properties of tobacco and the most effective ways to engage clients, a discussion of harmful substances in tobacco and motivational interviewing (MI) follows.\n\n【23】 #Harmful Substances in Tobacco\n\n【24】 Nicotine delivery to the brain can occur from traditional methods, such as cigarettes, chewing tobacco, and snuff. More recently, there is an increase in the use of unregulated products, such as e-cigarettes. When these unregulated products contain nicotine, they pose new challenges for tobacco interventions, because short-term and long-term effects of their use are unknown.\n\n【25】 #Motivational Interviewing\n\n【26】 #BAC K G R O U N D\nIntegrating Tobacco Interventions into Daily Practice -Third Edition\n\n【27】 #PROCESS OF MI DESCRIPTION\nEstablish a connection and working relationship.\nFocus on the client's needs in the conversation about change.\nPrompt the client to discuss his or her own motivations to change.\nDevelop a commitment to change and create an action plan.\nBasic skills in providing MI include asking open-ended questions, providing affirmations of comments made by clients, listening carefully and reflecting on the discussion, summarizing the conversation, and providing information and advice with the client's permission.\n\n【28】 #Open-Ended Questions:\nOpen-ended questions set the stage for affirmations, reflective listening, and summarizing. Ask questions that encourage the client to do most of the talking. Some examples include \"what concerns you about your health?\" or \"what is it that you like about smoking?\" or \"what reasons might you have for not quitting smoking?\" or \"tell me about the difficulties you encounter when trying to refill your prescriptions?\" . It is recommended to ask no more than three questions in a row.\nSupport for what the client is saying should occur frequently throughout the conversation. Praising or complimenting and exploring past successes help to build a therapeutic relationship.\n\n【29】 #Reflective Listening:\nAs a foundational skill in MI, reflective listening is useful to address resistance. Reflections can be as simple as \"you're feeling sad. \" They can also be more complex: \"it sounds like you are concerned about how smoking all these years may have affected your overall health. \" For reflective statements-whether simple, amplified, or double-sided-tell the client that you have heard what he or she is saying and encourage the client to explore his or her feelings. Simple reflection acknowledges the client's thoughts, feelings, and perspectives in a neutral manner.\nSummary statements are used to reflect back on key components of what the client has said and to check the healthcare providers' understanding of what has been shared by the client. The summary links together the main points of the interview, both past and present.\n\n【30】 #BAC K G R O U N D\nIntegrating Tobacco Interventions into Daily Practice -Third Edition\nGuiding Principles/Assumptions about Tobacco Interventions\n- Tobacco use is the single most preventable cause of disease, disability, and death worldwide.\n- Regular tobacco use is an addiction that requires treatment, support, and repeated interventions for clients.\n- Nurses at all points of care have an ethical and professional responsibility to provide access to evidence-based, best practice treatment and support to clients who use tobacco.\n- Tobacco users may relapse several times before achieving abstinence, and nurses need to re-engage clients in the tobacco intervention process .\n- It is important to encourage individuals who use tobacco, as well as those who do not, to make their homes tobacco-free to protect children, families, themselves, and others from exposure to second-hand smoke G and thirdhand smoke G.\nIntegrating Tobacco Interventions into Daily Practice -Third Edition A 2013 Cochrane review indicates that brief interventions can increase the likelihood of a successful quit attempt and increase the amount of time a client remains tobacco-free  .\n\n【31】 These interventions should be done in addition to providing support relevant to context (in-patient vs. community).  In-patient setting refers to all settings where clients are admitted (including hospital, long-term care home, psychiatric, or rehabilitation facilities).  Community setting refers to health promotion settings that are outside of hospital (clients are not admitted).\nIn-patient behavioural interventions (such as counselling support) during hospital stay and at least one month of supportive contact after discharge promote cessation, especially when combined with NRT (Rigotti, Clair, Munafò, & Stead, 2012).\nIntegrating Tobacco Interventions into Daily Practice -Third Edition\n\n【32】 #PLANNING RECOMMENDATION 2.1:\nDevelop a person-centred tobacco intervention plan with the client.\n\n【33】 #Discussion of Evidence:\nEach client encounter should be person-centred, with the goal of harm reduction. Health-care providers should recognize that each client brings unique and valuable perspectives to a health-care encounter. Person-centred care also recognizes that the social determinants of health contribute to a client's health status. Examples such as income, education, gender among others can impact behaviours, lifestyle choices, and interactions. Other factors such as age, lived experiences, and culture, G are also vital to consider when developing an intervention plan.\n\n【34】 Examples of populations disproportionately affected by tobacco may include, but are not limited to ethnic minorities, LGBTQ .\nIn Canada, patterns of tobacco use vary among population groups; however, Indigenous populations have a higher rate of tobacco use compared to the general population . For some Indigenous peoples in Canada and around the world, tobacco is used in traditional ceremonies. In these cases, tobacco is not burned for the purpose of inhaling smoke in the same way as commercial tobacco use. Therefore, it is not appropriate for health-care providers to intervene in the cultural practice of ceremonial tobacco use ,Aboriginal Nurses Association of\nIntegrating Tobacco Interventions into Daily Practice -Third Edition Canada, 2005. Traditional tobacco use is a sacred and cultural practice that is not harmful as it uses a natural tobacco plant, which does not include the thousands of chemicals present in commercial tobacco. As such, it is a practice that should be respected, and is not within the scope of the tobacco use interventions discussed in this guideline (First Nations Health Authority, 2016).\nWhen developing a tobacco intervention plan, health-care providers may consider asking the client:\n What does tobacco use mean to you?\n What do you see as the positives and negatives of using tobacco?\n Are there any small steps you can start making today to start reducing your tobacco use and/or reducing your children's or family members' exposure to second-hand and third-hand smoke?\n\n【35】 #IMPLEMENTATION RECOMMENDATION 3.1:\nProvide clients with, or refer them to, intensive interventions and counselling on the use of pharmacotherapy, if they use tobacco and express an interest in reducing or quitting their tobacco use.\n\n【36】 #Level of Evidence\nIa, V\n\n【37】 #Discussion of Evidence:\nIndividuals who use tobacco and who have expressed an interest in changing their tobacco use will benefit from intensive interventions G. Intensive interventions last more than 10 minutes and include assessment of the motivation to quit, identification of high-risk situations and triggers G to use tobacco, and discussion of problem-solving strategies to manage high-risk situations ,Stead et al.\nWhen it is not feasible or possible for a health-care provider to provide intensive interventions, refer the client to resources, such as a quitline G that can provide intensive interventions\nIntegrating Tobacco Interventions into Daily Practice -Third Edition\n\n【38】 #Behavioural Interventions\n Evidence suggests that the effectiveness of tobacco intervention treatment increases with intensity, regardless of the delivery mode or setting .\n Findings from a systematic review demonstrate that, for any population group, the most effective intervention components appear to include behavioural supports, such as problem-solving skills development .\n Incorporating tobacco behaviour monitoring and treatment interventions should be part of standard practice .\n The addition of pharmacotherapy to behavioural interventions contributes to increased success rates, and therefore pharmacotherapy as an additional intervention should be discussed with clients .\n\n【39】 #Pharmacological Interventions\n Pharmacotherapy can play an important role in the management of tobacco interventions.\n While an in-depth description of all pharmacological interventions is beyond the scope of this guideline, health-care providers should have knowledge of the pharmacotherapy options available and consider consulting with a nurse practitioner, pharmacist, or physician to determine how best to use prescribed pharmacotherapy as part of a combined intervention when working with clients who use tobacco.  Is an effective cessation method and increases the chances of quitting when compared to a placebo\n\n【40】 #Varenicline (prescription medication)\n Requires a prescription  Prevents relapse and decreases the pleasure associated with smoking\nIntegrating Tobacco Interventions into Daily Practice -Third Edition\nThe following interventions should be used with caution, since there is insufficient evidence to support their efficacy as cessation/harm reduction aids.\n\n【41】 #OTHER INTERVENTIONS INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT USE AS A CESSATION/HARM REDUCTION TOOL\nElectronic Cigarette  Many electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) mimic the look and feel of traditional cigarettes. However, instead of tobacco being combusted and inhaled as smoke, e-cigarettes produce a vapour that is inhaled or \"vaped.\" The vapour is produced when liquid (which may or may not contain nicotine) contained in the electronic cigarette is heated by the internal heating element and inhaled (American Cancer Society, 2016).\n Study results are mixed with regard to the efficacy of e-cigarettes as a cessation aid. A randomized controlled trial found that e-cigarettes may be as efficacious as nicotine replacement therapy .\n\n【42】  Due to the lack of consensus around the efficacy and safety of e-cigarettes, client counselling should focus on modalities that the literature has demonstrated to be efficacious, including counselling, nicotine replacement therapy, and other prescription pharmacotherapy options in consultation with a nurse practitioner, pharmacist, or physician.\n\n【43】 #Hypnotherapy, Laser Therapy, Electrostimulation, Acupressure, or Acupuncture\n\n【44】  Similarly, a Cochrane review found that, due to methodological issues, no clear conclusions can be drawn about the efficacy of acupuncture, acupressure, laser therapy or electro stimulation . Based on the inconclusive results and the cost of implementing these methods, they are not routinely recommended. However, the evidence does not indicate that these forms of therapy cause any harm to the client when used in conjunction with other evidence-based interventions.\nIntegrating Tobacco Interventions into Daily Practice -Third Edition\n\n【45】 #RECOMMENDATION 3.2:\nTreat or refer all pregnant or postpartum women at every encounter for intensive behavioural counselling for tobacco harm reduction, cessation, and relapse prevention, in conjunction with nicotine replacement therapy, on a case by case basis.\nLevel of Evidence = Ia, Ib, V\n\n【46】 #Discussion of Evidence:\nIn Canada, up to 10 percent of pregnant women use tobacco .\nMore women stop using tobacco during pregnancy than at any other time in their lives. Although approximately 15 to 60 percent of pregnant women stop using tobacco during pregnancy, the relapse rate can be up to 60 percent in the first few months postpartum and up to 80 percent one year postpartum .\nThe expert panel recommends using a tailored, woman-centred approach G to tobacco treatment to encourage a quit attempt and decrease the likelihood of relapse. This approach emphasizes the benefits of harm reduction or cessation for the woman and her fetus. Additionally, the expert panel recommends that, when safe for the woman, health-care providers should collaborate with the woman's partner and household members to develop awareness about the impacts of tobacco use and encourage the reduction or cessation of use.\n\n【47】 #Pharmacotherapy Interventions\nWhile a thorough description of specific pharmacological interventions during pregnancy is beyond the scope of this guideline, health-care providers should consider the use of pharmacotherapy as part of a combined intervention when working with clients who use tobacco. In general, with respect to pharmacological management, nurses should ensure that:\n- Pharmacotherapy options are considered in management planning.\n- Clients have access to appropriate pharmacotherapy.\nIntegrating Tobacco Interventions into Daily Practice -Third Edition Nicotine Replacement Therapy Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) may be considered as an adjunct to behavioural interventions during pregnancy and should be considered on a case by case basis. While evidence from the literature up to 2014 states that NRT should be provided as a second-line treatment after behavioural interventions have been unsuccessful, the expert panel recommends that NRT be provided during pregnancy simultaneously with intensive counselling to assist with cessation, harm reduction, and managing withdrawal symptoms. NRT is a beneficial harm reduction option to smoking during pregnancy, because it provides nicotine without exposure to the other carcinogenic compounds of cigarettes.\nThe expert panel recommends that intermittent forms of NRT can be offered during the first, second, and third trimesters, after discussing the risks and benefits with the client. Intermittent forms of NRT include nicotine gums, lozenges, inhalers, or sprays/mists. Should additional NRT support be required, the expert panel recommends using the nicotine patch, with the provision that it be removed at bedtime.\n\n【48】 #Bupropion and Varenicline\n\n【49】 At this time, the use of varenicline should be avoided during pregnancy and breastfeeding due to insufficient evidence regarding its safety and efficacy as a tobacco cessation intervention in pregnant women .\nIntegrating Tobacco Interventions into Daily Practice -Third Edition\n\n【50】 #EVALUATION RECOMMENDATION 4.1:\nEvaluate the effectiveness of the intervention plan until the client's goals are met.\n\n【51】 #Discussion of Evidence:\nAccording to the expert panel, establishing client goals and creating an intervention plan are essential when working with clients who use tobacco. Client goals for tobacco interventions may include cessation, reduction, or management of withdrawal symptoms. Treatment goals should be established during the first encounter with the client and reevaluated at each subsequent encounter. Ongoing evaluation of the intervention plan allows the health-care provider to assess client engagement and motivation regarding treatment, as well as the client's progress towards achieving treatment goals (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2005). The evaluation should be used to review and revise the existing treatment plan and the strategies used with the client in order to improve outcomes over the course of treatment.\nEvaluation of the client's progress may involve a health-care provider asking about the number of cigarettes smoked daily, triggers and cravings, withdrawal symptoms, relapses or slips G motivation levels, challenges, and successes. Evaluation at this stage may also address relapse prevention, so clients are well equipped when triggers present themselves. The expert panel acknowledges that achieving client goals regarding tobacco use may be a lifelong journey with multiple relapses. It is important to emphasize to the client that relapses are not indicative of failure.\nRelapses provide an opportunity to further evaluate a client's intervention plan and goals, triggers, and challenges. Once this re-evaluation occurs, the client's plan and goals are adjusted, as needed.\nIntegrating Tobacco Interventions into Daily Practice -Third Edition Education Recommendations\n\n【52】 #EDUCATION RECOMMENDATION 5.1:\nIncorporate evidence-based content on tobacco interventions in health-care professional education programs.\n\n【53】 #Discussion of Evidence:\n\n【54】 Enhanced tobacco education and training better prepares health professional students to address tobacco interventions with clients in practice .While the literature focuses primarily on integrating tobacco intervention content into classroom and continuing education settings, the expert panel strongly suggests that all orientation programs within clinical settings should also include tobacco intervention content.\n\n【55】 #Curriculum Development, Implementation, and Evaluation\nThe current literature investigating the implementation of tobacco intervention curriculum includes the following evaluation metrics: the number of hours spent on tobacco intervention, content areas covered, teaching methods, and evaluation of the learner. While there is literature that explores various methods of curriculum delivery, researchers have not specified which of these methods, if any, are the most effective format when delivering tobacco intervention curriculum. There is also lack of evidence exploring the integration of social determinants of health in the tobacco\nIntegrating Tobacco Interventions into Daily Practice -Third Edition intervention curriculum. Educators must draw on current social determinants of health literature for evidence on how to integrate these aspects into the curriculum. Basic clinical science topics are also often included in tobacco intervention curriculum.\n\n【56】 #EDUCATION METHOD EVIDENCE\nIndividuals who have attended in-person cessation education are more likely to educate and treat clients, and report increased preparedness to do so .\n\n【57】 #Simulation/ Standardized Client Training\n\n【58】 Studies have reported increased confidence among training participants with regard to advising their clients about cessation and assisting individuals who use tobacco products to quit .\nA self-directed continuing education program was found to have a universally positive impact on knowledge, attitudes, and intended clinical practices regarding tobacco interventions and treatment ,Studts, Burris, Kearns, Worth,\nIntegrating Tobacco Interventions into Daily Practice -Third Edition\n\n【59】 #EDUCATION METHOD EVIDENCE\nMixed modalities .\n\n【60】 #Training Session\nGeneral practitioners who undertake a 40-minute training session to understand treatment options and enhance referral skills can significantly increase the number of referrals to cessation services and help clients quit .\nOne day of didactic training G and role-play sessions can facilitate short-and long-term changes in health-care professional attitudes and behaviours regarding tobacco intervention counselling .\nIntensive cessation counselling programs .\n\n【61】 #Train-the-Trainer Programs\nIn train-the-trainer programs G well-informed educators train less experienced educators on content delivery. This can enhance the amount of tobacco education provided in a health-care students' curriculum, as seen in a study of acute care nurse practitioner programs . When more faculty members devoted time to cessation education, there was an increased perceived effectiveness of cessation education and increased value was placed on using evidence-based guidelines. The total number of hours devoted to providing tobacco intervention education increased, and the number of faculty members who devoted at least three hours to tobacco education increased.\nA two-day train-the-trainer program can enhance the level of tobacco education provided in acute care nurse practitioner programs .\nIntegrating Tobacco Interventions into Daily Practice -Third Edition\n\n【62】 #RECOMMENDATION 5.2:\nEnsure delivery of tobacco intervention curriculum is facilitated by educators who are trained and skilled in the field of tobacco use interventions.\n\n【63】 #Discussion of Evidence:\n\n【64】 There are a number of positive outcomes when educators are equipped with evidence-based knowledge on tobacco intervention and treatment. When educators complete a recognized program on tobacco intervention and treatment, their education ensures that the quality of education provided to students and/or other health-care providers is of a high standard.\nExposure to training also makes educators more likely to develop and integrate tobacco-related content and competencies into their teaching .\nEducators Advocate with policy-makers at all levels of government for comprehensive smoke-and vapefree legislation and enforcement in the community.\n\n【65】 #Discussion of Evidence:\nHealth-care providers should advocate for smoke-free laws to enhance public health across people's life spans by improving air quality and thereby reducing avoidable hospital admissions related to respiratory and cardiovascular events-in particular, heart attacks and acute coronary syndrome .\nThe expert panel, with supporting evidence from the literature, suggests that health-care providers are well positioned to influence and support the effectiveness of tobacco control legislation in various ways. This may include: advocating for national bans on smoking and vaping, advocating for increased cigarette taxation, and engaging and supporting individuals who smoke while national smoke and vape-free laws are being implemented.\n- National bans on smoking and vaping .\n In countries with strong tobacco policies, tobacco users are more likely to quit .\n Smoke-free legislation improves air quality and decreases the public's exposure to second-hand smoke .\n Nurses and other health-care professionals should advocate for 100 percent smoke-free legislation that bans smoking and vaping in all public places, including workplaces, without exemptions or designated smoking rooms.\nIntegrating Tobacco Interventions into Daily Practice -Third Edition\n\n【66】 #Increased cigarette taxation (i.e. government-imposed taxes on the cost of cigarettes)\n There is a correlation between cigarette price increases and positive changes in smoking behaviour .\n Enforcement efforts should be expanded and directed towards minimizing the availability of legal and illegal low-or no-tax cigarettes .\n- Engaging and supporting individuals who smoke while national smoke-and vape-free laws are being implemented .\n Smoke-free legislation is correlated with increased quit attempts; therefore, providing individual support during times when new smoke-free legislation is being introduced may assist in further increasing cessation rates .\nThrough a combination of upstream approaches that focus on advocacy for smoke-and vape-free legislation, healthcare providers can participate in tobacco protection and prevention initiatives that serve to decrease the burden of tobacco-related illness at an individual and community level.\n\n【67】 #RECOMMENDATION 6.2:\nImplement and enforce comprehensive tobacco-free policies in all health-care delivery settings and with all clients, including in-patients and out-patients, as well as with permanent and contract staff.\n\n【68】 #Discussion of Evidence:\nHealth-care organizations have a professional and legal responsibility to address tobacco use and promote harm reduction through the implementation of comprehensive tobacco-free policies. Tobacco-free policies have already been established in general hospital settings in Canada and in several other countries . Implementation of policies in these countries has illustrated numerous benefits for clients, health-care provider staff, and the health-care organizations.\nPoder, Carroll, Wallace, and Hua  highlighted that tobacco-free workplaces are associated with decreased exposure to second-hand smoke. Furthermore, tobacco-free work environments also contributed to more quit attempts and quit success in a cross-sectional study . Tobacco-free policies may also help to:\n Reduce the incidence and prevalence of tobacco use on hospital property,  Set an important precedent for best practices and positive behaviour change among clients and staff, and  Encourage other establishments to become smoke-and vape-free in the interest of public health.\nFindings from a systematic review indicated that tobacco-free policies implemented in two psychiatric facilities contributed to a significant decline in tobacco consumption among clients during admission and up to three months post-discharge . Similarly, a cross-sectional study conducted in mental health settings concluded\nIntegrating Tobacco Interventions into Daily Practice -Third Edition that tobacco-free hospitalization policies led to more quit attempts and perceived health improvements , further research is required on the effects of tobacco-free policies on clients and staff in health-care settings other than mental health environments.\nTo support the implementation and enforcement of comprehensive tobacco-free policies within organizational practice and culture, the expert panel recommends that health-care providers, leaders, and decision-makers:\n campaign to eliminate tobacco use in designated areas and rooms, and at designated times ,\nProviding nicotine replacement therapy is particularly important to ensure that staff and clients who use tobacco are supported while tobacco-free policies are in place. A comprehensive, multi-strategy program that includes unrestricted access to nicotine replacement therapy for staff and clients enhanced the delivery of tobacco care in hospitals .\nImplementing comprehensive tobacco-free policies in all health-care settings provides a supportive environment for both clients and health-care staff to reduce or quit their tobacco use. All health-care settings should, therefore, be encouraged to implement and/or build on and enforce existing tobacco-free policies and interventions.\n\n【69】 #RECOMMENDATION 6.3:\nEmbed tobacco use prompts in health records/documentation to facilitate addressing tobacco interventions during health-care visits.\n\n【70】 #Level of Evidence = Ib\nDiscussion of Evidence:\nThe expert panel recommends that organizations embed tobacco intervention prompts in health records to facilitate clinical decision-making around the provision of tobacco treatment for clients. A client's tobacco use status should be documented on paper charts or on electronic health records .\nEHRs have the capability to remind clinicians to document tobacco use status and deliver brief advice, prompt cessation medication prescriptions, and facilitate referrals to counselling . While the majority of the studies were conducted in primary care settings, the expert panel supports the implementation of tobacco intervention prompts in EHRs, or on paper charts when EHRs are not available, in other health-care settings.\nExamples of how to embed prompts in EHRs to support clinical decision-makers and improve the treatment of tobacco use by clients include the following:\n Embed prompts to document tobacco status with all clients at every visit. Documentation is an important step in tobacco intervention treatment .  Develop cessation templates and algorithms that can be integrated into the client's e-chart and used as prompts.\n Develop simple, one-click counselling referral functionalities, which could include referrals to the local quitline .\nIntegrating Tobacco Interventions into Daily Practice -Third Edition RECOMMENDATION 6.4:\nEvaluate tobacco intervention programs and services.\n\n【71】 #Discussion of Evidence:\nProgram evaluation is an important component of the implementation process that should not be overlooked. An evaluation plan needs to be developed prior to program implementation to provide the roadmap for the program objectives, implementation strategies, action steps, expected milestones, and desired impacts (National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, 2011).\nProgram evaluation should include evaluation metrics for the implementation plan that capture structural, process, and outcome data. Facilitators and barriers should be identified within the evaluation plan and monitored throughout all phases of the project, with the aim of improving future approaches. The structural evaluation should capture whether or not the organization possesses the resources required to support a cessation program prior to implementation. Examples can include adequate staffing, orientation programs for staff on smoking cessation and, budget to provide free nicotine replacement therapy. Process evaluation looks at the process of providing care, intervention and/or education. Examples include assessing whether all clients were offered brief interventions, or if all clients were provided information on nicotine replacement therapy. Outcome evaluation may focus on assessing client quit attempts, reduction rates, or a decline in the client's nicotine withdrawal symptoms. In addition, it is important to determine how the evaluation data will be collected. Evaluation tools to facilitate data collection may include surveys, scales, audits and feedback, or observational assessments (RNAO, 2012). Evaluation data can be used to demonstrate the impact of the intervention, its cost-effectiveness, and whether changes are required to improve the effectiveness of the intervention.\nIntegrating Tobacco Interventions into Daily Practice -Third Edition\n\n【72】 #Research Gaps and Future Implications\nIn reviewing the evidence for this guideline, the RNAO expert panel identified three priority areas for research where there is insufficient or low methodological quality evidence. They are broadly categorized as practice, outcome, and health system research\nIntegrating Tobacco Interventions into Daily Practice -Third Edition\n\n【73】 #Implementation Strategies\nGuideline implementation at the point of care is multi-faceted and challenging; it takes more than awareness and distribution of guidelines to get people to change how they practice. Guidelines must be adapted for each practice setting in a systematic and participatory way, to ensure recommendations fit the local context (Harrison, Graham, Fervers, & van den Hoek, 2013). RNAO's Toolkit: Implementation of Best Practice Guidelines (RNAO, 2012) provides an evidenceinformed process based on implementation science for successful uptake of the guidelines .\nThe critical success factors identified in the Toolkit include:\n Leaders at all levels are committed to supporting guideline implementation.\n Stakeholders for whom the guidelines are relevant are identified and engaged in the implementation.\n A comprehensive readiness assessment is required prior to guideline implementation.\n Guidelines are customized to the local context.\n Barriers and facilitators to guideline implementation are identified, monitored and where possible, mitigation strategies are implemented.\n Interventions to promote uptake of the guidelines are selected.\n Evaluation of the guidelines' impact is embedded in the process.\n There are adequate resources to complete all aspects of the implementation.\n\n【74】 RNAO is committed to widespread dissemination and implementation of our BPGs. RNAO uses a coordinated approach for dissemination, incorporating a variety of strategies, including:\na The Nursing Best Practice Champions Network, which develops the capacity of individual nurses to foster awareness, engagement, and adoption of BPGs; b Nursing Order Sets G which provide clear, concise, actionable intervention statements derived from the BPGs' practice recommendations that can be readily embedded within electronic health records, but may also be used in paper-based or hybrid environments; and c The Best Practice Spotlight Organization (BPSO) designation, which supports implementation at the organization and system levels. BPSOs focus on developing evidence-based cultures with the specific mandate to implement, evaluate, and sustain multiple RNAO BPGs.\nIntegrating Tobacco Interventions into Daily Practice -Third Edition\nIn addition, we offer capacity-building learning institutes on specific guidelines and their implementation annually (RNAO, 2012).\nInformation about the full range of RNAO implementation strategies can be found at:\n\n【75】 #Evaluating and Monitoring this Guideline\nAs you implement the recommendations in this guideline, we ask you to consider how you will monitor and evaluate their implementation and impact.\nOther RNAO resources for the evaluation and monitoring of best practice guidelines include the following:\n Nursing Quality Indicators for Reporting and Evaluation (NQuIRE) were designed for RNAO's Best Practice Spotlight Organization (BPSO) program to systematically monitor the progress and evaluate the impact of implementing RNAO best practice guidelines in these organizations. NQuIRE is the first international quality improvement initiative of its kind, consisting of a database of quality indicators derived from recommendations within selected RNAO clinical best practice guidelines.\n Nursing Order Sets embedded within EHRs provide a mechanism for electronic data capture of process indicators. The ability to link structure and process indicators with specific outcome indicators aids in determining the impact of BPG implementation on specific client health outcomes.\nIntegrating Tobacco Interventions into Daily Practice -Third Edition\n\n【76】 #Process for Update and Review of Best Practice Guidelines\nThe Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario (RNAO) commits to updating its Best Practice Guidelines as follows:\n- A team of specialists in the topic area will review each nursing best practice guideline every five years following publication of the previous edition.\n- International Affairs and Best Practice Guidelines (IaBPG) Centre staff regularly monitor for new systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials, and other relevant literature in the field.\n- Based on that monitoring, staff may recommend an earlier revision period. Appropriate consultation with members of the original expert panel and other specialists and experts in the field will help inform the decision to review and revise guidelines earlier than planned. 5. New editions of guidelines will be disseminated based on established structures and processes.\n\n【77】 #R E F E R E N C E S\nIntegrating Tobacco Interventions into Daily Practice -Third Edition\n\n【78】 #A P P E N D I C E S\nIntegrating Tobacco Interventions into Daily Practice -Third Edition Client: Refers, in this guideline, to any individual(s) with whom health-care providers establish a therapeutic relationship for the purposes of collaborating for health. The term client may include all of the following: individual, person, patient, resident, consumer, and his or her family (parents, significant others, caregivers, friends, substitute decision-makers, groups, communities, and populations).\n\n【79】 #Didactic training:\nA non-interactive presentation of factual information, often given in lecture style, from the health-care provider to the client.\n\n【80】 #Education recommendation:\nA statement of educational requirements and educational approaches or strategies for the introduction, implementation, and sustainability of a Best Practice Guideline.\n\n【81】 #Electronic Health Record (EHR):\nA term widely used in many countries, with varied definitions and extent of coverage, today it generally refers to a longitudinal health record with entries by health-care practitioners in multiple sites where care is provided. The electronic health record  contains all personal health information belonging to an individual;\n is entered and accessed electronically by health-care providers over the person's lifetime; and  extends beyond acute in-patient situations to include all ambulatory care settings at which the patient receives care (World Health Organization, 2006).\nEvidence: Information that comes closest to the facts of a matter. The form it takes depends on context. The findings of high quality, methodologically appropriate research provide the most accurate evidence. Because research is often incomplete and sometimes contradictory or unavailable, other kinds of information are necessary supplements to, or stand-ins for, research. The evidence base for a decision is the multiple forms of evidence combined to balance rigour with expedience while privileging the former over the latter (Canadian Health Services Research Foundation, 2005).\n\n【82】 #A P P E N D I C E S\nIntegrating Tobacco Interventions into Daily Practice -Third Edition Intensive intervention: An intervention in which there is extended contact (more than 10 minutes) between the health-care provider and the client.\nInter-professional health-care team: A team composed of multiple health-care providers (regulated and unregulated) who work collaboratively to deliver comprehensive and quality healthcare and services to people within, between, and across health-care settings (Health Care Innovation Working Group, 2012;RNAO, 2013).\nA systematic review of randomized controlled trials that uses statistical methods to analyze and summarize the results of the included studies (The Cochrane Collaboration, 2005).\n\n【83】 #Motivational Interviewing (MI):\nA collaborative, goal-oriented style of communication with particular attention to the language of change. It is designed to strengthen personal motivation for and commitment to a specific goal by eliciting and exploring the person's own reasons for change within an atmosphere of acceptance and compassion .\n\n【84】 #Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT):\nA medication containing nicotine that is intended to promote smoking cessation while preventing exposure to the harms associated with tobacco (Health Canada, 2011). The nicotine patch, gum, lozenge, inhaler, and spray are currently approved for use in Canada.\nNurse: Includes registered nurses, licensed practical nurses (referred to as registered practical nurses in Ontario), registered psychiatric nurses, and nurses in advanced practice roles, such as nurse practitioners and clinical nurse specialists (RNAO, 2013).\n\n【85】 Pharmacotherapy: Prescription or over-the-counter cessation aids that assist clients to quit smoking. Over the counter cessation aids include nicotine replacement therapy options, such as the patch, gum, lozenge, inhaler, or spray. Prescription options include bupropion or varenicline (Jiloha, 2014).\nPopulations disproportionately affected by tobacco: Includes individuals who experience a greater negative effect from tobacco use than the general population, due to the social determinants of health-for example, clients living with a mental health disorder.\nPractice recommendation: A statement of best practice directed at health-care providers that enables the successful implementation of a best practice guideline; ideally, practice recommendations are based on evidence.\n\n【86】 #A P P E N D I C E S\nIntegrating Tobacco Interventions into Daily Practice -Third Edition Psychosocial intervention: A non-pharmacological intervention designed to increase tobacco abstinence rates through strategies such as cognitive-behavioural, motivational, and supportive therapies .\nQualitative research: Research that uses an interactive and subjective approach to investigate and describe phenomena (e.g. lived experience) and to give them meaning. The nature of this type of research is exploratory and open-ended. Analysis involves the organization and interpretation of non-numerical data (e.g. phenomenology, ethnography, grounded theory, and case study) .\nThe degree to which health-care services for individuals and populations increase the likelihood of desired health outcomes and are consistent with current professional knowledge ,The World Alliance for Patient Safety\nDrafting Group, 2009.\n\n【87】 #Quasi-experimental study:\n\n【88】 Quitline: Telephone-based tobacco cessation services that help tobacco users quit. Services offered by quitlines include coaching and counselling, referrals, mailed materials, training for health-care providers, web-based services, and (in some instances) free medications, such as nicotine replacement therapy. Much research shows that quitlines are highly effective in helping tobacco users quit. Due to their ability to reach and serve tobacco users, regardless of location, quitlines have quickly spread across North America.\n\n【89】 #Randomized Controlled trial (RCT):\nAn experiment in which the investigator assigns an intervention, exposure, or treatment to participants who are randomly allocated to an experimental group (receives intervention), a comparison group (receives conventional treatment), or a control group (receives no intervention or a placebo) (The Cochrane Collaboration, 2005). The participants are followed and assessed to determine the efficacy of the intervention. Randomized controlled trials include double blind, single blind, and non-blind trials.\nRelapse or slip: A relapse refers to a client who has returned to his or her baseline levels of smoking after a period of abstinence. A slip refers to a client who has smoked a cigarette or two after a period of abstinence, but quickly returns to a state of abstinence.\nSecond-hand smoke: The smoke exhaled by an individual burning a tobacco product, such as a cigarette, cigar, or pipe. There are more than 7,000 chemicals in second-hand smoke, at least 69 of which are known carcinogens .\nSmoke-free legislation: Legislation that prohibits or limits the use of tobacco in certain spaces.\n\n【90】 #A P P E N D I C E S\nIntegrating Tobacco Interventions into Daily Practice -Third Edition Detailed information about the search strategy for the systematic review, including the inclusion and exclusion criteria, as well as search terms, is available online.\nRetrieved articles were divided equally between two nursing research associates (NRA), who are nurses holding master's degrees. Each NRA independently assessed the eligibility of the studies according to established inclusion/ exclusion criteria. The RNAO's Best Practice Guideline program manager, involved in supporting the RNAO expert panel, resolved disagreements between NRAs.\n\n【91】 A complete bibliography of all full-text articles screened for inclusion is available online.\n\n【92】 #Tobacco Intervention Panel of Experts\nTop Row: (L-R): Tiiu Sildva, Tanvi Sharma, Lisa Ye, Jan Johnston, Dr. Patricia Smith, Jennifer Bouwmeester, Tanya Magee, Debbie Aitken, and Dr. Annette Schultz; Bottom Row: (L-R) Jennifer Callaghan, Sheila John, Dr. Shelley Walkerley, Gail Luciano, Dr. Peter Selby, and Claire Gignac; Missing: Jennifer Tiberio, Natalie Hamilton-Martin, and Dr. Catherine Goldie\nThe RNAO expert panel's mandate was to develop an evidence-based best practice guideline that will provide nurses and other health-care providers with current best practices for engaging clients who use tobacco.

This involves removing all or almost all visible cancerous tissue. More tissue is removed than with standard surgery. The aim is to improve outcomes for people with advanced ovarian cancer.\n\n【2】 #Recommendations\nEvidence on the safety and efficacy of maximal cytoreductive surgery for advanced ovarian cancer is adequate to support using this procedure provided that standard arrangements are in place for clinical governance, consent and audit.\nPatient selection should be done by a specialist gynaecological cancer multidisciplinary team, which may include surgeons from other specialities.\nThe procedure should be done by a team of surgeons with appropriate expertise. The procedure should only be done in accredited specialised units.\nFor auditing the outcomes of this procedure, the main efficacy and safety outcomes identified in this guidance can be entered into NICE's interventional procedure outcomes audit tool (for use at local discretion)\n\n【3】 #The condition, current treatments and procedure\n\n【4】 #The condition\nEarly symptoms of ovarian cancer can be similar to those of other pelvic or abdominal conditions and include persistent bloating, pain in the pelvis and lower abdomen, urinary frequency and urinary urgency. Ovarian cancer is usually at stage 3 or 4 when it is diagnosed and the outcome is generally poor. The overall 5‑year survival rate for ovarian cancer is about 43%, and is lower for people with more advanced disease. The stage of the disease at diagnosis is the most important factor affecting outcome and is defined by the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) system:\nStage 1 (A to C): the tumour is confined to the ovary.\nStage 3 (A to C): the tumour involves 1 or both ovaries with microscopically confirmed peritoneal metastasis outside the pelvis, or regional lymph node metastasis (if cancer cells are found only in fluid taken from inside the abdomen the cancer is stage 2).\nThe FIGO stage does not fully take into account the tumour load and disease extent in advanced disease.\n\n【5】 #Current treatments\nNICE's guideline on the recognition and initial management of ovarian cancer describes the initial management options. The main treatments for advanced ovarian cancer are surgery to remove all macroscopic residual disease (residual disease is cancer left behind at the end of cytoreductive surgery; this type of surgery is also known as debulking) and chemotherapy. Standard surgery usually involves, as a minimum, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, total abdominal hysterectomy and omentectomy. Maximal cytoreductive surgery uses additional surgical procedures, including upper abdominal surgery, with the aim of achieving no residual disease. The most important factors affecting outcomes after surgery are responsiveness to platinum-based chemotherapy and the amount of residual disease.\nConventional imaging techniques cannot accurately predict the distribution or volume of disease before surgery. Therefore, the only definitive assessment of the distribution or volume of disease found in the abdomen and pelvis is done at the time of surgery. Currently, no objective tools exist to select people for surgery and a decision for surgery will depend on many factors, including fitness, patient choice, availability of surgeons with appropriate expertise and resource levels.\n\n【6】 #The procedure\nThe aim of maximal cytoreductive surgery for advanced ovarian cancer is to safely remove all identifiable disease, to improve survival, compared with surgery that leaves residual disease.

{"seq_id": "45d2b7fa-09a8-4440-934f-74cf3f1f1c40", "title": null, "text": "【0】 Steroid metabolism\nSteroid metabolism is the complete set of chemical reactions in organisms that produce, modify and consume steroids. These metabolic pathways include: steroid synthesis - where steroids are synthesized from more simple precursors, steroidogenesis - where different types of steroids are interconverted, as well as steroid degradation.\n\n【1】 #Steroid biosynthesis\nSteroid biosynthesis is an anabolic metabolic pathway that produces steroids from simple precursors. This pathway is carried out in different ways in animals than in many other organisms, making the pathway a common target for antibiotics and other anti-infective drugs. In addition, steroid metabolism in humans is the target of cholesterol-lowering drugs such as statins.\nIt starts in the mevalonate pathway in humans, with Acetyl-CoA as building blocks, which form DMAPP and IPP. In following steps, DMAPP and IPP form lanosterol, the first steroid. Further modification belongs to the succeeding steroidogenesis.\n\n【2】 ## Mevalonate pathway\nThe mevalonate pathway or HMG-CoA reductase  pathway starts with and ends with dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP) and isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP).\n\n【3】 ### Regulation and feedback\nSeveral key enzymes can be activated through DNA transcriptional regulation on activation of SREBP (Sterol Regulatory Element-Binding Protein-1 and -2). This intracellular sensor detects low cholesterol levels and stimulates endogenous production by the HMG-CoA reductase pathway, as well as increasing lipoprotein uptake by up-regulating the LDL receptor. Regulation of this pathway is also achieved by controlling the rate of translation of the mRNA, degradation of reductase and phosphorylation.\n\n【4】 ### Pharmacology\nA number of drugs target the mevalonate pathway:\n- Statins (used for elevated cholesterol levels);\n- Bisphosphonates (used in treatment of various bone-degenerative diseases)\n\n【5】 ### In plants and bacteria\nIn plants and bacteria the non-mevalonate pathway uses pyruvate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate as substrates.\n\n【6】 ## DMAPP to lanosterol\nIsopentenyl pyrophosphate and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate donate isoprene units, which are assemblied and modificated to form terpenes and isoprenoids, which are a large class of lipids that include the carotenoids and form the largest class of plant natural products.\n\n【7】 #Steroidogenesis\nSteroidogenesis is where desired forms of steroids are generated by transformation of other steroids\nProducts of steroidogenesis include:\n- androgens testosterone\n- estrogens and progesterone\n- corticoids cortisol aldosterone\n\n【8】 #Elimination\nSteroids are mainly oxidized by cytochrome P450 oxidase enzymes, such as CYP3A4, these reactions introduce oxygen into the steroid ring and allows the structure to be broken up by other enzymes, to form bile acids as final products. These bile acids can then be eliminated through secretion from the liver in the bile. The expression of this oxidase gene can be upregulated by the steroid sensor PXR when there is a high blood concentration of steroids.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

It is a result of the relative excess or lack of pigment within an iris or part of an iris, which may be genetically inherited or due to mosaicism,  or acquired by disease or injury.\nEye color, specifically the color of the irises, is determined primarily by the concentration and distribution of melanin pigment within the iris tissues.\nConsequently, anything affecting those factors may result in a difference of color being observed.\nThe affected eye may be hyperpigmented (hyperchromic) or hypopigmented (hypochromic). An excess of pigmentation is usually associated with hyperplasia of the iris tissues whereas a lack of pigmentation is associated with hypoplasia. Although seen in humans, heterochromia in which one iris differs in color from the other iris is more frequently observed in non-human species such as cats (for example, Japanese Bobtails and Turkish Vans; white, shorthaired cats can be \"odd-eyed\" with one copper or orange eye and one blue eye, and the Turkish Angora), dogs (for example, Siberian Huskies as well as Australian Shepherds, Border Collies, and other breeds with merle coats), horses (so-called \"wall-eyed\" horses have one brown and one white or blue eye), and even water buffalo. Partial or sectoral heterochromia is much less common than complete heterochromia and is typically found in autosomally inherited disorders such as Hirschsprung's disease and Waardenburg syndrome. Famous comedian Dan Akroyd has this condition.\n\n【2】 #Classification based on etiology\nAlthough a distinction is frequently made between heterochromia that affects an eye completely or only partially, it is often classified as either genetic (due to mosaicism or congenital) or acquired, with mention as to whether the affected iris or portion of the iris is darker or lighter.\n\n【3】 ## Congenital heterochromia\nHeterochromia that is congenital is usually inherited as an autosomal dominant trait.\n- Lisch nodules - iris hamartomas seen in neurofibromatosis.\n- Ocular melanosis - a condition characterized by increased pigmentation of the uveal tract, episclera, and anterior chamber angle.\n- Oculodermal melanocytosis (nevus of Ota)\n- Pigment dispersion syndrome - a condition characterized by loss of pigmentation from the posterior iris surface which is disseminated intraocularly and deposited on various intraocular structures, including the anterior surface of the iris.\n- Simple heterochromia - a rare condition characterized by the absence of other ocular or systemic problems. The lighter eye is typically regarded as the affected eye as it usually shows iris hypoplasia. It may affect an iris completely or only partially.\n- Congenital Horner's syndrome - sometimes inherited, although usually acquired\n- Incontinentia pigmenti\n- Parry-Romberg syndrome\n\n【4】 ## Acquired heterochromia\nHeterochromia that is acquired is usually due to injury, inflammation, the use of certain eyedrops, or tumors.\n- Deposition of material\nSiderosis - iron deposition within ocular tissues due to a penetrating injury and a retained iron-containing, intraocular foreign body.\nHemosiderosis - long standing hyphema (blood in the anterior chamber) following blunt trauma to the eye may lead to iron deposition from blood products\n- Use of certain eyedrops - prostaglandin analogues (latanoprost, isopropyl unoprostone, travoprost, and bimatoprost) are used topically to lower intraocular pressure in glaucoma patients. A concentric heterochromia has developed in some patients applying these drugs. The stroma around the iris sphincter muscle becomes darker than the peripheral stroma. A stimulation of melanin synthesis within iris melanocytes has been postulated.\n- Neoplasm - Nevi and melanomatous tumors.\n- Iridocorneal endothelium syndrome\n- Fuchs' heterochromic iridocyclitis - a condition characterized by a low grade, asymptomatic uveitis in which the iris in the affected eye becomes hypochromic and has a washed-out, somewhat moth eaten appearance. The heterochromia can be very subtle, especially in patients with lighter colored irises. It is often most easily seen in daylight. The prevalence of heterochromia associated with Fuch's has been estimated in various studies with results suggesting that there is more difficulty recognizing iris color changes in dark-eyed individuals.\n- Acquired Horner's syndrome - usually acquired, as in neuroblastoma, although sometimes inherited.\n- Neoplasm - Melanomas can also be very lightly pigmented, and a lighter colored iris may be a rare manifestation of metastatic disease to the eye.\n- Chronic iritis - Juvenile xanthogranuloma - Leukemia and lymphoma\n\n【5】 ## Life Threatening Causes\n- Leukemia - Lymphoma - Neoplasm\n\n【6】 ## Common Causes\n- Acquired horner's syndrome\n- Chronic iritis - Congenital horner's syndrome\n- Duane syndrome\n- Eye hemorrhage\n- Eye injury\n- Foreign body in eye\n- Glaucoma - Hypoplasia - Incontinentia pigmenti\n- Iridocorneal endothelium syndrome\n- Pigment dispersion syndrome\n- Rubeosis iridis - Uveitis\n\n【7】 ## Causes in Alphabetical Order\n- Acquired horner's syndrome\n- Bimatoprost\n- Chromosome 8 trisomy syndrome\n- Chronic iritis - Congenital horner's syndrome\n- Duane syndrome\n- Eye hemorrhage\n- Eye injury\n- Foreign body in eye\n- Fuchs' heterochromic cyclitis - Glaucoma - Hemosiderosis - Hirschsprung's disease\n- Hypoplasia - Incontinentia pigmenti\n- Inherited trait\n- Iridocorneal endothelium syndrome\n- Isopropyl unoprostone\n- Juvenile xanthogranuloma - Leukemia - Lisch nodules\n- Lymphoma - Neoplasm\n- Neurofibromatosis - Ocular melanosis - Parry-romberg syndrome\n- Piebaldism\n- Pigment dispersion syndrome\n- Rubeosis iridis - Siderosis - Sturge-weber syndrome\n- Travoprost\n- Uveitis", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

This could be in people with a narrow pelvis or high body mass index, or where the position of the tumour is low in the rectum.\nBefore surgery, the patient has bowel preparation and prophylactic antibiotics. Using general anaesthesia, and with the patient in the lithotomy position, standard abdominal laparoscopic mobilisation of the left colon and upper rectum is done. After inserting an operating platform into the anus, the lower rectum including the total mesorectum is mobilised. At the start of the transanal part of the procedure, a purse-string suture is put in to close the rectal lumen. This is followed by a full thickness rectotomy. After identifying the total mesorectal excision plane, the dissection progresses proximally until it connects with the dissection from above. The specimen can be removed through the transanal platform or, if the tumour is large, through the abdomen using a small incision. Anastomosis to connect the colon and the anus can be done using sutures (hand-sewn technique) or staples, and a temporary ileostomy is usually created.

The recommendations supersede MMWR 1993;42(No. RR-6)1-13. Antiviral agents also have an important role in the control of influenza. Recommendations for the use of antiviral agents will be published later in 1994 as Part II of these recommendations\n\n【1】 #INTRODUCTION\nInfluenza A viruses are classified into subtypes on the basis of two surface antigens: hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). Three subtypes of hemagglutinin (H1, H2, and H3) and two subtypes of neuraminidase (N1 and N2) are recognized among influenza A viruses that have caused widespread human disease. Immunity to these antigens-especially to the hemagglutinin-reduces the likelihood of infection and lessens the severity of disease if infection occurs. Infection with a virus of one subtype confers little or no protection against viruses of other subtypes. Furthermore, over time, antigenic variation (antigenic drift) within a subtype may be so marked that infection or vaccination with one strain may not induce immunity to distantly related strains of the same subtype. Although influenza B viruses have shown more antigenic stability than influenza A viruses, antigenic variation does occur. For these reasons, major epidemics of respiratory disease caused by new variants of influenza continue to occur. The antigenic characteristics of circulating strains provide the basis for selecting the virus strains included in each year's vaccine.\nTypical influenza illness is characterized by abrupt onset of fever, myalgia, sore throat, and nonproductive cough. Unlike other common respiratory illnesses, influenza can cause severe malaise lasting several days. More severe illness can result if either primary influenza pneumonia or secondary bacterial pneumonia occurs. During influenza epidemics, high attack rates of acute illness result in both increased numbers of visits to physicians' offices, walk-in clinics, and emergency rooms and increased hospitalizations for management of lower respiratory tract complications.\nElderly persons and persons with underlying health problems are at increased risk for complications of influenza. If they become ill with influenza, such members of high-risk groups  are more likely than the general population to require hospitalization. During major epidemics, hospitalization rates for persons at high risk may increase two-to five-fold, depending on the age group. Previously healthy children and younger adults may also require hospitalization for influenza-related complications, but the relative increase in their hospitalization rates is less than for persons who belong to high-risk groups.\nAn increase in mortality further indicates the impact of influenza epidemics. Increased mortality results not only from influenza and pneumonia but also from cardiopulmonary and other chronic diseases that can be exacerbated by influenza. It is estimated that >10,000 influenza-associated deaths occurred during each of seven different U.S. epidemics in the period 1977-1988, and >40,000 influenza-associated deaths occurred during each of two of these epidemics. Approximately 90% of the deaths attributed to pneumonia and influenza occurred among persons ≥65 years of age.\nBecause the proportion of elderly persons in the U.S. population is increasing and because age and its associated chronic diseases are risk factors for severe influenza illness, the number of deaths from influenza can be expected to increase unless control measures are implemented more vigorously. The number of persons <65 years of age at increased risk for influenza-related complications is also increasing. Better survival rates for organ-transplant recipients, the success of neonatal intensive-care units, and better management of diseases such as cystic fibrosis and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) result in a higher survival rate for younger persons at high risk.\n\n【2】 #OPTIONS FOR THE CONTROL OF INFLUENZA\nIn the United States, two measures are available that can reduce the impact of influenza: immunoprophylaxis with inactivated (killed-virus) vaccine and chemoprophylaxis or therapy with an influenza-specific antiviral drug (amantadine or rimantadine). Vaccination of persons at high risk each year before the influenza season is currently the most effective measure for reducing the impact of influenza. Vaccination can be highly cost effective when a it is directed at persons who are most likely to experience complications or who are at increased risk for exposure and b it is administered to persons at high risk during hospitalizations or routine health-care visits before the influenza season, thus making special visits to physicians' offices or clinics unnecessary. When vaccine and epidemic strains of virus are well matched, achieving high vaccination rates among persons living in closed settings (e.g. nursing homes and other chronic-care facilities) can reduce the risk for outbreaks by inducing herd immunity.\n\n【3】 #INACTIVATED VACCINE FOR INFLUENZA A AND B\nEach year's influenza vaccine contains three virus strains (usually two type A and one type B) representing the influenza viruses that are likely to circulate in the United States in the upcoming winter. The vaccine is made from highly purified, egg-grown viruses that have been made noninfectious (inactivated). Influenza vaccine rarely causes systemic or febrile reactions. Whole-virus, subvirion, and purified-surfaceantigen preparations are available. To minimize febrile reactions, only subvirion or purified-surface-antigen preparations should be used for children; any of the preparations may be used for adults.\nMost vaccinated children and young adults develop high postvaccination hemagglutination-inhibition antibody titers. These antibody titers are protective against illness caused by strains similar to those in the vaccine or the related variants that may emerge during outbreak periods. Elderly persons and persons with certain chronic diseases may develop lower postvaccination antibody titers than healthy young adults and thus may remain susceptible to influenza-related upper respiratory tract infection. However, even if such persons develop influenza illness despite vaccination, the vaccine has been shown to be effective in preventing lower respiratory tract involvement or other secondary complications, thereby reducing the risk for hospitalization and death.\nThe effectiveness of influenza vaccine in preventing or attenuating illness varies, depending primarily on the age and immunocompetence of the vaccine recipient and the degree of similarity between the virus strains included in the vaccine and those that circulate during the influenza season. When there is a good match between vaccine and circulating viruses, influenza vaccine has been shown to prevent illness in approximately 70% of healthy persons <65 years of age. In these circumstances, studies have also indicated that influenza vaccine is approximately 70% effective in preventing hospitalization for pneumonia and influenza among elderly persons living in settings other than nursing homes or similar chronic-care facilities.\nAmong elderly persons residing in nursing homes, influenza vaccine is most effective in preventing severe illness, secondary complications, and death. Studies of this population have shown the vaccine to be 50%-60% effective in preventing hospitalization and pneumonia and 80% effective in preventing death, even though efficacy in preventing influenza illness may often be in the range of 30%-40% among the frail elderly. Achieving a high rate of vaccination among nursing home residents has been shown to reduce the spread of infection in a facility, thus preventing disease through herd immunity.\n\n【4】 #RECOMMENDATIONS FOR USE OF INFLUENZA VACCINE\nInfluenza vaccine is strongly recommended for any person ≥6 months of age whobecause of age or underlying medical condition-is at increased risk for complications of influenza. Health-care workers and others (including household members) in close contact with persons in high-risk groups should also be vaccinated. In addition, influenza vaccine may be administered to any person who wishes to reduce the chance of becoming infected with influenza. The trivalent influenza vaccine prepared for the 1994-95 season will include A/Texas/36/91-like (H1N1), A/Shangdong/9/93-like (H3N2), and B/Panama/45/90-like hemagglutinin antigens Guidelines for the use of vaccine among different groups follow.\nAlthough the current influenza vaccine can contain one or more of the antigens administered in previous years, annual vaccination with the current vaccine is necessary because immunity declines in the year following vaccination. Because the 1994-95 vaccine differs from the 1993-94 vaccine, supplies of 1993-94 vaccine should not be administered to provide protection for the 1994-95 influenza season.\nTwo doses administered at least 1 month apart may be required for satisfactory antibody responses among previously unvaccinated children <9 years of age; however, studies with vaccines similar to those in current use have shown little or no improvement in antibody responses when a second dose is administered to adults during the same season.\nDuring the past decade, data on influenza vaccine immunogenicity and side effects have been obtained for intramuscularly administered vaccine. Because there has been no adequate evaluation of recent influenza vaccines administered by other routes, the intramuscular route is recommended. Adults and older children should be vaccinated in the deltoid muscle and infants and young children in the anterolateral aspect of the thigh.\n\n【5】 #TARGET GROUPS FOR SPECIAL VACCINATION PROGRAMS\nTo maximize protection of high-risk persons, they and their close contacts should be targeted for organized vaccination programs.\n\n【6】 #Groups at Increased Risk for Influenza-Related Complications:\n- Persons ≥65 years of age - Residents of nursing homes and other chronic-care facilities that house persons of any age with chronic medical conditions - Adults and children with chronic disorders of the pulmonary or cardiovascular systems, including children with asthma - Adults and children who have required regular medical follow-up or hospitalization during the preceding year because of chronic metabolic diseases (including diabetes mellitus), renal dysfunction, hemoglobinopathies, or immunosuppression (including immunosuppression caused by medications) - Children and teenagers (6 months-18 years of age) who are receiving long-term aspirin therapy and therefore may be at risk for developing Reye syndrome after influenza  800 FLU-SHIELD.  Because of the lower potential for causing febrile reactions, only split-virus vaccines should be used for children. They may be labeled as \"split,\" \"subvirion,\" or \"purified-surface-antigen\" vaccine. Immunogenicity and side effects of split-and whole-virus vaccines are similar among adults when vaccines are administered at the recommended dosage.  The recommended site of vaccination is the deltoid muscle for adults and older children. The preferred site for infants and young children is the anterolateral aspect of the thigh.  Two doses administered at least 1 month apart are recommended for children <9 years of age who are receiving influenza vaccine for the first time.\n\n【7】 #Groups that Can Transmit Influenza to Persons at High Risk\nPersons who are clinically or subclinically infected and who care for or live with members of high-risk groups can transmit influenza virus to them. Some persons at high risk (e.g. the elderly, transplant recipients, and persons with AIDS) can have low antibody responses to influenza vaccine. Efforts to protect these members of high-risk groups against influenza may be improved by reducing the likelihood of influenza exposure from their care givers. Therefore, the following groups should be vaccinated: - Physicians, nurses, and other personnel in both hospital and outpatient-care settings;\n- Employees of nursing homes and chronic-care facilities who have contact with patients or residents;\n- Providers of home care to persons at high risk (e.g. visiting nurses and volunteer workers); - Household members (including children) of persons in high-risk groups.\n\n【8】 #VACCINATION OF OTHER GROUPS General Population\nPhysicians should administer influenza vaccine to any person who wishes to reduce the likelihood of becoming ill with influenza. Persons who provide essential community services may be considered for vaccination to minimize disruption of essential activities during influenza outbreaks. Students or other persons in institutional settings, such as those who reside in dormitories, should be encouraged to receive vaccine to minimize the disruption of routine activities during epidemics.\n\n【9】 #Pregnant Women\nInfluenza-associated excess mortality among pregnant women has not been documented except in the pandemics of 1918-19 and 1957-58. However, pregnant women who have other medical conditions that increase their risks for complications from influenza should be vaccinated because the vaccine is considered safe for pregnant women-regardless of the stage of pregnancy. Thus, it is undesirable to delay vaccination of pregnant women who have high-risk conditions and who will still be in the first trimester of pregnancy when the influenza season begins.\n\n【10】 #Persons Infected with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)\nLimited information exists regarding the frequency and severity for influenza illness among HIV-infected persons, but reports suggest that symptoms may be prolonged and the risk for complications increased for some HIV-infected persons. Because influenza can result in serious illness and complications, vaccination is a prudent precaution and will result in protective antibody levels in many recipients. However, the antibody response to vaccine may be low in persons with advanced HIVrelated illnesses; a booster dose of vaccine does not improve the immune response for these persons.\n\n【11】 #Foreign Travelers\nThe risk for exposure to influenza during foreign travel varies, depending on season and destination. In the tropics, influenza can occur throughout the year; in the southern hemisphere, the season of greatest activity is April-September. Because of the short incubation period for influenza, exposure to the virus during travel can result in clinical illness that begins while traveling, an inconvenience or potential danger, especially for persons at increased risk for complications. Persons preparing to travel to the tropics at any time of year or to the southern hemisphere during April-September should review their influenza vaccination histories. If they were not vaccinated the previous fall or winter, they should consider influenza vaccination before travel. Persons in the high-risk categories should be especially encouraged to receive the most current vaccine. Persons at high risk who received the previous season's vaccine before travel should be revaccinated in the fall or winter with the current vaccine.\n\n【12】 #PERSONS WHO SHOULD NOT BE VACCINATED\nInactivated influenza vaccine should not be administered to persons known to have anaphylactic hypersensitivity to eggs or to other components of the influenza vaccine without first consulting a physician . Use of an antiviral agent (amantadine or rimantadine) is an option for prevention of influenza A in such persons. However, persons who have a history of anaphylactic hypersensitivity to vaccine components but who are also at higher risk for complications of influenza may benefit from vaccine after appropriate allergy evaluation and desensitization. Specific information about vaccine components can be found in package inserts for each manufacturer.\nAdults with acute febrile illness usually should not be vaccinated until their symptoms have abated. However, minor illnesses with or without fever should not contraindicate the use of influenza vaccine, particularly among children with mild upper respiratory tract infection or allergic rhinitis.\n\n【13】 #SIDE EFFECTS AND ADVERSE REACTIONS\nBecause influenza vaccine contains only noninfectious viruses, it cannot cause influenza. Respiratory disease after vaccination represents coincidental illness unrelated to influenza vaccination. The most frequent side effect of vaccination reported by fewer than one-third of vaccinees is soreness at the vaccination site that lasts for up to 2 days. In addition, two types of systemic reactions have occurred:\n- Fever, malaise, myalgia, and other systemic symptoms occur infrequently and most often affect persons who have had no exposure to the influenza virus antigens in the vaccine (e.g. young children). These reactions begin 6-12 hours after vaccination and can persist for 1 or 2 days; - Immediate-presumably allergic-reactions (e.g. hives, angioedema, allergic asthma, and systemic anaphylaxis) occur rarely after influenza vaccination. These reactions probably result from hypersensitivity to some vaccine component; the majority of reactions are most likely related to residual egg protein. Although current influenza vaccines contain only a small quantity of egg protein, this protein may induce immediate hypersensitivity reactions among persons with severe egg allergy. Persons who have developed hives, have had swelling of the lips or tongue, or have experienced acute respiratory distress or collapse after eating eggs should consult a physician for appropriate evaluation to help determine if vaccine should be administered. Persons with documented immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated hypersensitivity to eggs-including those who have had occupational asthma or other allergic responses due to exposure to egg protein-may also be at increased risk for reactions from influenza vaccine, and similar consultation should be considered. The protocol for influenza vaccination developed by Murphy and Strunk may be considered for patients who have egg allergies and medical conditions that place them at increased risk for influenza-associated complications (Murphy and Strunk, 1985).\nHypersensitivity reactions to any vaccine component can occur. Although exposure to vaccines containing thimerosal can lead to induction of hypersensitivity, most patients do not develop reactions to thimerosal when administered as a component of vaccines even when patch or intradermal tests for thimerosal indicate hypersensitivity. When reported, hypersensitivity to thimerosal has usually consisted of local, delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions.\nUnlike the 1976-77 swine influenza vaccine, subsequent vaccines prepared from other virus strains have not been associated clearly with an increased frequency of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). However, it is difficult to make a precise estimate of risk for a rare condition such as GBS. In 1990-91, although there was no overall increase in frequency of GBS among vaccine recipients, there may have been a small increase in GBS cases in vaccinated persons 18-64 years of age, but not in those aged ≥65 years. In contrast to the swine influenza vaccine, the epidemiologic features of the possible association of the 1990-91 vaccine with GBS were not as convincing. Even if GBS were a true side effect, the very low estimated risk for GBS is less than that of severe influenza that could be prevented by vaccine.\n\n【14】 #SIMULTANEOUS ADMINISTRATION OF OTHER VACCINES, INCLUDING CHILDHOOD VACCINES\nThe target groups for influenza and pneumococcal vaccination overlap considerably. Both vaccines can be administered at the same time at different sites without increasing side effects. However, influenza vaccine must be administered each year, whereas pneumococcal vaccine is not. Children at high risk for influenza-related complications may receive influenza vaccine at the same time they receive other routine vaccinations, including pertussis vaccine (DTP or DTaP). Because influenza vaccine can cause fever when administered to young children, DTaP may be preferable in those children ≥15 months of age who are receiving the fourth or fifth dose of pertussis vaccine. DTaP is not licensed for the initial three-dose series of pertussis vaccine.\n\n【15】 #TIMING OF INFLUENZA VACCINATION ACTIVITIES\nBeginning each September (when vaccine for the upcoming influenza season becomes available) persons at high risk who are seen by health-care providers for routine care or as a result of hospitalization should be offered influenza vaccine. Opportunities to vaccinate persons at high risk for complications of influenza should not be missed.\nThe optimal time for organized vaccination campaigns for persons in high-risk groups is usually the period from mid-October through mid-November. In the United States, influenza activity generally peaks between late December and early March. High levels of influenza activity infrequently occur in the contiguous 48 states before December. It is particularly important to avoid administering vaccine too far in advance of the influenza season in facilities such as nursing homes because antibody levels may begin to decline within a few months of vaccination. Vaccination programs can be undertaken as soon as current vaccine is available if regional influenza activity is expected to begin earlier than December.\nChildren <9 years of age who have not been vaccinated previously should receive two doses of vaccine at least 1 month apart to maximize the likelihood of a satisfactory antibody response to all three vaccine antigens. The second dose should be administered before December, if possible. Vaccine should be offered to both children and adults up to and even after influenza virus activity is documented in a community.\n\n【16】 #STRATEGIES FOR IMPLEMENTING INFLUENZA VACCINE RECOMMENDATIONS\nAlthough rates of influenza vaccination have increased in recent years, surveys indicate that less than half of the high-risk population receives influenza vaccine each year. More effective strategies are needed for delivering vaccine to persons at high risk and to their health-care providers and household contacts.\nIn general, successful vaccination programs have combined education for healthcare workers, publicity and education targeted toward potential recipients, a plan for identifying (usually by medical-record review) persons at high risk, and efforts to remove administrative and financial barriers that prevent persons from receiving the vaccine. Persons for whom influenza vaccine is recommended can be identified and vaccinated in the settings described in the following paragraphs.\n\n【17】 #Outpatient Clinics and Physicians' Offices\nStaff in physicians' offices, clinics, health-maintenance organizations, and employee health clinics should be instructed to identify and label the medical records of patients who should receive vaccine. Vaccine should be offered during visits beginning in September and throughout the influenza season. The offer of vaccine and its receipt or refusal should be documented in the medical record. Patients among highrisk groups who do not have regularly scheduled visits during the fall should be reminded by mail or telephone of the need for vaccine. If possible, arrangements should be made to provide vaccine with minimal waiting time and at the lowest possible cost.\n\n【18】 #Facilities Providing Episodic or Acute Care\nHealth-care providers in these settings (e.g. emergency rooms and walk-in clinics) should be familiar with influenza vaccine recommendations. They should offer vaccine to persons in high-risk groups or should provide written information on why, where, and how to obtain the vaccine. Written information should be available in language(s) appropriate for the population served by the facility.\n\n【19】 #Nursing Homes and Other Residential Long-Term-Care Facilities\nVaccination should be routinely provided to all residents of chronic-care facilities with the concurrence of attending physicians rather than by obtaining individual vaccination orders for each patient. Consent for vaccination should be obtained from the resident or a family member at the time of admission to the facility, and all residents should be vaccinated at one time, immediately preceding the influenza season. Residents admitted during the winter months after completion of the vaccination program should be vaccinated when they are admitted.\n\n【20】 #Acute-Care Hospitals\nAll persons ≥65 years of age and younger persons (including children) with highrisk conditions who are hospitalized from September through March should be offered and strongly encouraged to receive influenza vaccine before they are discharged. Household members and others with whom they will have contact should receive written information about why and where to obtain influenza vaccine.\n\n【21】 #Outpatient Facilities Providing Continuing Care to Patients at High Risk\nAll patients should be offered vaccine before the beginning of the influenza season. Patients admitted to such programs (e.g. hemodialysis centers, hospital specialtycare clinics, outpatient rehabilitation programs) during the winter months after the earlier vaccination program has been conducted should be vaccinated at the time of admission. Household members should receive written information regarding the need for vaccination and the places to obtain influenza vaccine.\n\n【22】 #Visiting Nurses and Others Providing Home Care to Persons at High Risk\nNursing-care plans should identify patients in high-risk groups, and vaccine should be provided in the home if necessary. Care givers and others in the household (including children) should be referred for vaccination.\n\n【23】 #Facilities Providing Services to Persons ≥65 Years of Age\nIn these facilities (e.g. retirement communities and recreation centers), all unvaccinated residents/attendees should be offered vaccine on site before the influenza season. Education/publicity programs should also be provided; these programs should emphasize the need for influenza vaccine and provide specific information on how, where, and when to obtain it.\n\n【24】 #Clinics and Others Providing Health Care for Travelers\nIndications for influenza vaccination should be reviewed before travel, and vaccine should be offered if appropriate .\n\n【25】 #Health-Care Workers\nAdministrators of all health-care facilities should arrange for influenza vaccine to be offered to all personnel before the influenza season. Personnel should be provided with appropriate educational materials and strongly encouraged to receive vaccine. Particular emphasis should be placed on vaccination of persons who care for members of high-risk groups (e.g. staff of intensive-care units , staff of medical/surgical units, and employees of nursing homes and chronic-care facilities). Using a mobile cart to take vaccine to hospital wards or other work sites and making vaccine available during night and weekend work shifts may enhance compliance, as may a follow-up campaign early in the course of community outbreak.\n\n【26】 #SOURCES OF INFORMATION ON INFLUENZA-CONTROL PROGRAMS\nInformation regarding influenza surveillance is available through the CDC Voice Information System (influenza update), telephone  332-4551, or through the CDC Information Service on the Public Health Network electronic bulletin board. From October through May, the information is updated at least every other week. In addition, periodic updates about influenza are published in MMWR. State and local health departments should also be consulted regarding availability of vaccine, access to vaccination programs, and information about state or local influenza activity.\n\n【27】 #Selected Bibliography\nThe Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) Series is prepared by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and is available on a paid subscription basis from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S.\nThe data in the weekly MMWR are provisional, based on weekly reports to CDC by state health departments.

When hydrogen sulfide (H2S) (or sulfide ions) and ferric ions combine in the blood, the blood is incapable of carrying oxygen.\nThis can be caused by taking medications that contain sulfonamides under certain conditions (i.e.: overdosing of sumatriptan). Drugs associated with sulfhemoglobinemia include acetanilid, phenacetin, nitrates, trinitrotoluene and sulfur compounds (mainly sulphonamides). Another possible cause is occupational exposure to sulfur compounds. The condition generally resolves itself with erthryocyte (red blood cell) turnover, although blood transfusions can be necessary in extreme cases. The pigment is a greenish derivative of hemoglobin which cannot be converted back to normal, functional hemoglobin. It causes cyanosis even at low blood levels.\nSymptoms include a blueish or greenish discoloration of the blood, skin, and mucous membranes, even though a blood count test may not show any abnormalities in the blood.\nOn June 11, 2007, Canadian surgeons Dr. Stephan Schwarz and Dr. Alana Flexman presented an unusual case in The Lancet. A 42-year-old male patient was brought into Vancouver's St. Paul's Hospital after falling asleep in a sitting position. When doctors drew the man's blood to relieve pressure from his legs, the blood was green. A sample of the blood was immediately sent to a lab.

Therefore, contact with the eyes should be avoided. If a reaction suggesting local irritation occurs, patients should be directed to use the medication less frequently or discontinue use. Metronidazole is a nitroimidazole and should be used with care in patients with evidence of, or history of blood dyscrasia.\n\n【11】 ## Clinical Trials Experience\n- The following adverse experiences have been reported with the topical use of metronidazole: burning, skin irritation, dryness, transient redness, metallic taste, tingling or numbness of extremities and nausea.\n\n【12】 ## Postmarketing Experience\nThere is limited information regarding Metronidazole (topical) Postmarketing Experience in the drug label.\n\n【13】 #Drug Interactions\n- Oral metronidazole has been reported to potentiate the anticoagulant effect of coumarin and warfarin resulting in a prolongation of prothrombin time. The effect of topical metronidazole on prothrombin time is not known.\n\n【14】 ### Pregnancy\nPregnancy Category (FDA): B\n- There has been no experience to date with the use of metronidazole topical gel in pregnant patients. Metronidazole crosses the placental barrier and enters the fetal circulation rapidly. No fetotoxicity was observed after oral metronidazole in rats or mice. However, because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response and since oral metronidazole has been shown to be a carcinogen in some rodents, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.\nThere is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Metronidazole (topical) in women who are pregnant.\n\n【15】 ### Labor and Delivery\nThere is no FDA guidance on use of Metronidazole (topical) during labor and delivery.\n\n【16】 ### Nursing Mothers\n- After oral administration, metronidazole is secreted in breast milk in concentrations similar to those found in the plasma. Even though metronidazole topical gel blood levels are significantly lower than those achieved after oral metronidazole, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\n\n【17】 ### Pediatric Use\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Metronidazole (topical) in pediatric settings.\n\n【18】 ### Geriatic Use\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Metronidazole (topical) in geriatric settings.\n\n【19】 ### Gender\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Metronidazole (topical) with respect to specific gender populations.\n\n【20】 ### Race\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Metronidazole (topical) with respect to specific racial populations.\n\n【21】 ### Renal Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Metronidazole (topical) in patients with renal impairment.\n\n【22】 ### Hepatic Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Metronidazole (topical) in patients with hepatic impairment.\n\n【23】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Metronidazole (topical) in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n\n【24】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\nThere is no FDA guidance one the use of Metronidazole (topical) in patients who are immunocompromised.\n\n【25】 ### Administration\n- Topical\n\n【26】 ### Monitoring\nThere is limited information regarding Metronidazole (topical) Monitoring in the drug label.\n\n【27】 #IV Compatibility\nThere is limited information regarding the compatibility of Metronidazole (topical) and IV administrations.\n\n【28】 #Overdosage\nThere is limited information regarding Metronidazole (topical) overdosage\n\n【29】 ## Mechanism of Action\nThere is limited information regarding Metronidazole (topical) Mechanism of Action in the drug label.\n\n【30】 ## Structure\n- Metronidazole topical gel contains metronidazole, USP, at a concentration of 7.5 mg per gram (0.75%) in a gel consisting of carbomer 940, edetate disodium, methylparaben, propylene glycol, propylparaben, purified water, and sodium hydroxide. Metronidazole is classified therapeutically as an antiprotozoal and antibacterial agent. Chemically, metronidazole is named 2-methyl-5-nitro-1H-imidazole-1-ethanol and has the following structure:\n\n【31】 ## Pharmacodynamics\n- Bioavailability studies on the topical administration of 1 gram of metronidazole topical gel (7.5 mg of metronidazole) to the face of 10 rosacea patients showed a maximum serum concentration of 66 nanograms per milliliter in one patient. This concentration is approximately 100 times less than concentrations afforded by a single 250 mg oral tablet. The serum metronidazole concentrations were below the detectable limits of the assay at the majority of time points in all patients. Three of the patients had no detectable serum concentrations of metronidazole at any time point. The mean dose of gel applied during clinical studies was 600 mg which represents 4.5 mg of metronidazole per application. Therefore, under normal usage levels, the formulation affords minimal serum concentrations of metronidazole. The mechanisms by which metronidazole topical gel acts in the treatment of rosacea are unknown, but appear to include an anti-inflammatory effect.\n\n【32】 ## Pharmacokinetics\nThere is limited information regarding Metronidazole (topical) Pharmacokinetics in the drug label.\n\n【33】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\n- Metronidazole has shown evidence of carcinogenic activity in a number of studies involving chronic, oral administration in mice and rats but not in studies involving hamsters.\n- Metronidazole has shown evidence of mutagenic activity in several in vitro bacterial assay systems. In addition, a dose-response increase in the frequency of micronuclei was observed in mice after intraperitoneal injections and an increase in chromosome aberrations have been reported in patients with Crohn’s disease who were treated with 200-1200 mg/day of metronidazole for 1 to 24 months. However, no excess chromosomal aberrations in circulating human lymphocytes have been observed in patients treated for 8 months.\n\n【34】 #Clinical Studies\nThere is limited information regarding Metronidazole (topical) Clinical Studies in the drug label.\n\n【35】 #How Supplied\n\n【36】 Distributed by:\nOwen Laboratories, Inc. a Galderma Company\nGalderma is a registered trademark.\nMade in Canada\nP52445-0\nRevised: June 2014\n\n【37】 ## Storage\n- STORE AT CONTROLLED ROOM TEMPERATURE: 68° to 77°F (20° to 25°C).\n\n【38】 ## Package and Label Display Panel\nLOT:\nEXP.:\nMetronidazole Topical Gel 0.75%\n\n【39】 Rx only\nNET WT. 45 g\nOwen\nFOR TOPICAL USE ONLY.

Shown here is a portion of the SPIRE spectrum of VY Canis Majoris (VY CMa), a red supergiant star near the end of its life, which is ejecting huge quantities of gas and dust into interstellar space. The inset is a SPIRE camera map of VY CMa, in which it appears as a bright compact source near the edge of a large extended cloud.\"\n\"The VY CMa spectrum is amazingly rich, with prominent features from carbon monoxide (CO) and water (H2O). More than 200 other spectral features have been identified so far in the full spectrum, and several unidentified features are being investigated. Many of the features are due to water, showing that the star is surrounded by large quantities of hot steam As in all of the SPIRE spectra, the underlying emission increases towards shorter wavelengths, and is due to the emission from dust grains. The shape of the dust spectrum provides information on the properties of the dust.\"\n\"VY Canis Majoris (VY CMa) is a red supergiant star located about 4900 light years from Earth in the constellation Canis Major. It is the largest known star, with a size of 2600 solar radii, and also one of the most luminous, with a luminosity in excess of 100 000 times that of the Sun. The mass of VY CMa lies in the range 30-40 solar masses, and it has a mass-loss rate of 2 x 10-4 solar masses per year.\"\n\n【1】 #Torbernites\nTorbernite is a radioactive, hydrated green copper uranyl phosphate mineral, found in granites and other uranium-bearing deposits as a secondary mineral. Torbernite is isostructural with the related uranium mineral, autunite. The chemical formula of torbenite is similar to that of autunite in which a Cu2+ cation replaces a Ca2+. The number of water hydration molecules can vary between 12 and 8, giving rise to the variety of metatorbernite when torbernite spontaneously dehydrates.\n\n【2】 #Bands\nAt the right is Saturn imaged by the Stockholm Infrared Camera (SIRCA) in the H2O infrared band to show the presence of water vapor. The image is cut off near the top due to the presence of Saturn's rings.\n\n【3】 #Backgrounds\n\"The light blue background is the dayglow emission (less than 1 kR) caused by the interaction between the photoelectrons generated by solar UV radiation and atmospheric molecules and atoms.\" This background occurs when imaging an Earth aurora from space using ultraviolet astronomy at the VUV wavelengths (135.6 ± 1.5 nm and 149.3 ± 1.5 nm).\n\"Isophotes of  background starlight brightness (integrated starlight, diffuse galactic light, cosmic light) have been constructed near the celestial , ecliptic , and galactic  poles from observations accumulated by the Pioneer 10  imaging photopolarimeter from beyond the asteroid belt.\"\n\"Diffuse galactic  light refers to starlight scattered by interstellar grains. Integrated light from extragalactic sources is referred to as cosmic light.\"\n\"Earth-based observers are limited in their perception of background starlight, due to the presence of airglow line and continuum emission, zodiacal light, and the effects of atmospheric extinction and scattering.\"\nSome of the blue background data were collected on September 30, 1973 (day/year 279/73).\n\"To determine the brightnesses, isophotes were generated from six days of merged data, chosen to optimize sky coverage. The days used and their heliocentric distances in AU are: 354/72 (3.27), 149/73 (4.23), 237/73 (4.64), 279/73 (4.81), 21/74 (5.08), 68/74 (5.15).\"\nConversion of units over the Pioneer blue (B) bandpass is\nFor example,\nNCP  S_{10}(V)_B = 56,  NEP  S_{10}(V)_B = 66,  and NGP  S_{10}(V)_B = 31.\nWhereas,\n\n【4】 #Violets\n\"The abundance ratios of stable isotopes of the light elements in comets may provide clues of cosmogonical significance.\"\n\"In 1997 we observed comet Hale-Bopp with the 2.6 m Nordic Optical Telescope on La Palma, Canary Islands, with a view to estimating the 12C/13C abundance ratio. About twenty high-resolution (λ /Δ λ ~ 70000) spectra of the strong CN Violet  band were secured with the SOFIN spectrograph from 7 to 13 April. The heliocentric and geocentric distances of the comet were then close to 0.9 AU and 1.4 AU, respectively. While the data do show the expected lines of the 13C14N isotopic molecule, we have been surprised to find in addition a number of very weak features, which are real and turn out to be positioned very near to the theoretical wavelengths of lines pertaining to the R branch of 12C15N.\"\n\n【5】 #Blues\n\"The light blue background is the dayglow emission (less than 1 kR) caused by the interaction between the photoelectrons generated by solar UV radiation and atmospheric molecules and atoms.\" This background occurs when imaging an Earth aurora from space using ultraviolet astronomy at the VUV wavelengths (135.6 ± 1.5 nm and 149.3 ± 1.5 nm).\n\n【6】 #Submillimeters\nSubmillimetre astronomy or submillimeter astronomy is the branch of observational astronomy that is conducted at submillimetre wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum. Astronomers place the submillimetre waveband between the far-infrared and microwave wavebands, typically taken to be between a few hundred micrometres and a millimetre.\" and \"Using submillimetre observations, astronomers examine molecular clouds and dark cloud cores with a goal of clarifying the process of star formation from earliest collapse to stellar birth.\nThese wavelengths are sometimes called Terahertz radiation, since they have frequencies of the order of 1 THz.\n\"The Antennae Galaxies (also known as NGC 4038 and 4039) are a pair of distorted colliding spiral galaxies about 70 million light-years away, in the constellation of Corvus (The Crow).

The radio observation of perhaps greatest human interest is the claim of interstellar glycine, the simplest amino acid, but with considerable accompanying controversy.\n\n【8】 #Atmospheres\n\"If we know beforehand that a nebula is not of the emission type, observations of its polarization enable us to go a step farther. In general, if a particle scatters light in such a way that it does not hold the energy for any length of time but simply defects it without change of wave-length, then the polarization of the deflected light has the following characteristics: (a) its plane of polarization is usually perpendicular to or, more rarely, parallel to the plane formed by the incident and the scattered rays; and (b) the amount of polarization is inversely correlated with the size of the particles. When the scattering particles are of the order of size of a few hundred molecules or smaller we have what is usually known as Rayleigh scattering. Here the polarization reaches very large values, as is evidenced by our own blue atmosphere, which gives values up to 70 per cent.\"\n\n【9】 #Compounds\n\"Baby stars are forming near the eastern rim of the cosmic cloud Perseus, in this infrared image from NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope.\"\n\"The baby stars are approximately three million years old and are shown as reddish-pink dots to the right of the image. The pinkish color indicates that these infant stars are still shrouded by the cosmic dust and gas that collapsed to form them. These stars are part of the IC348 star cluster, which consists of over 300 known member stars.\"\n\"The image is a three channel false color composite, where emission at 4.5 microns is blue, emission at 8.0 microns is green, and 24-micron emission is red.\"\n\n【10】 #Molecular clouds\nG0.253+0.016 was probed \"with another network of telescopes, the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy  in California.\"\n\"G0.253+0.016, which is about 30 light-years long, defies the conventional wisdom that dense gas glouds should produce lots of stars, The cloud is 25 times more dense than the famous Orion Nebula, which is birthing stars at a furious rate. But only a few stars are being born in G0.253+0.016, and they're pretty much all runts.\"\n\"It's a very dense cloud and it doesn't form any massive stars, which is very weird\".\n\"CARMA data showed that gas within G0.253+0.016 is zipping around 10 times faster than gas in similar clouds. G0.253+0.016 is on the verge of flying apart, with its gas churning too violently to coalesce into stars. Further, the . cloud is full of silicon monoxide, a compound typically produced when fast-moving gas smashes into dust particles. The abnormally large amounts of silicon monoxide suggest that G0.253+0.016 may actually consist of two colliding clouds, whose impact is generating powerful shockwaves.\"\nWhen surveyed at 1.1 mm as part of the Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey, \"he only currently known starless  MPC is G0.253+0.016, which lies within the dense central molecular zone and is subject to greater environmental stresses than similar objects in the Galactic plane .\"\nDef. a \"large and relatively dense cloud of cold gas and dust in interstellar space from which new stars are formed\" is called a molecular cloud.\nThe image on the right is a composite of visible (B 440 nm and V 557 nm) and near-infrared (768 nm) of the dark cloud (absorption cloud) Barnard 68.\nBarnard 68 is around 500 lyrs away in the constellation Ophiuchus.\n\"At these wavelengths, the small cloud is completely opaque because of the obscuring effect of dust particles in its interior.\"\n\"It was obtained with the 8.2-m VLT ANTU telescope and the multimode FORS1 instrument in March 1999.\"\nIn the image second down at right is a molecular cloud of gas and dust that is being reduced. \"Likely, within a few million years, the intense light from bright stars will have boiled it away completely. The cloud has broken off of part of the Carina Nebula, a star forming region about 8000 light years away. Newly formed stars are visible nearby, their images reddened by blue light being preferentially scattered by the pervasive dust. This image spans about two light years and was taken by the orbiting Hubble Space Telescope in 1999.\"\nA molecular cloud, sometimes called a stellar nursery if star formation is occurring within, is a type of interstellar cloud whose density and size permits the formation of molecules, most commonly molecular hydrogen (H2).\nMolecular hydrogen is difficult to detect by infrared and radio observations, so the molecule most often used to determine the presence of H2 is CO (carbon monoxide). The ratio between CO luminosity and H2 mass is thought to be constant, although there are reasons to doubt this assumption in observations of some other galaxies.\nSuch clouds make up < 1% of the ISM, have temperatures of 10-20 K and high densities of 102 - 106 atoms/cm3. These clouds are astronomical radio and infrared sources with radio and infrared molecular emission and absorption lines.\n\n【11】 #Giant molecular clouds\nA vast assemblage of molecular gas with a mass of approximately 103–107 times the mass of the Sun is called a giant molecular cloud (GMC). GMCs are ≈15–600 light-years in diameter (5–200 parsecs). Whereas the average density in the solar vicinity is one particle per cubic centimetre, the average density of a GMC is 102–103 particles per cubic centimetre. Although the Sun is much denser than a GMC, the volume of a GMC is so great that it contains much more mass than the Sun. The substructure of a GMC is a complex pattern of filaments, sheets, bubbles, and irregular clumps.\nThe densest parts of the filaments and clumps are called \"molecular cores\", whilst the densest molecular cores are, unsurprisingly, called \"dense molecular cores\" and have densities in excess of 104–106 particles per cubic centimeter. Observationally molecular cores are traced with carbon monoxide and dense cores are traced with ammonia. The concentration of dust within molecular cores is normally sufficient to block light from background stars so that they appear in silhouette as dark nebulae.\nGMCs are so large that \"local\" ones can cover a significant fraction of a constellation; thus they are often referred to by the name of that constellation, e.g. the Orion Molecular Cloud (OMC) or the Taurus Molecular Cloud (TMC). These local GMCs are arrayed in a ring in the neighborhood of the Sun coinciding with the Gould Belt. The most massive collection of molecular clouds in the galaxy forms an asymmetrical ring around the galactic center at a radius of 120 parsecs; the largest component of this ring is the Sagittarius B2 complex. The Sagittarius region is chemically rich and is often used as an exemplar by astronomers searching for new molecules in interstellar space.\n\n【12】 #Astrophysics\nDef. a cavity filled with hot gas blown into the interstellar medium by stellar winds is called an astrosphere.\n\n【13】 #Venus\nThe surface is obscured by a thick blanket of clouds. Venus is shrouded by an opaque layer of highly reflective clouds of sulfuric acid, preventing its surface from being seen from space in visible light. It has thick clouds of sulfur dioxide. There are lower and middle cloud layers. The thick clouds consisting mainly of sulfur dioxide and sulfuric acid droplets. These clouds reflect and scatter about 90% of the sunlight that falls on them back into space, and prevent visual observation of the Venusian surface. The permanent cloud cover means that although Venus is closer than Earth to the Sun, the Venusian surface is not as well lit.\nStrong 300 km/h winds at the cloud tops circle the planet about every four to five earth days. Venusian winds move at up to 60 times the speed of the planet's rotation, while Earth's fastest winds are only 10% to 20% rotation speed.\n\n【14】 #Earth\n\"Energetic neutral atoms (ENA), emitted from the magnetosphere with energies of ∼50 keV, have been measured with solid-state detectors on the IMP 7/8 and ISEE 1 spacecraft. The ENA are produced when singly charged trapped ions collide with the exospheric neutral hydrogen geocorona and the energetic ions are neutralized by charge exchange.\"\n\"The IMAGE mission . High Energy Neutral Atom imager (HENA) . images  at energies between 10 and 60 keV/nucleon  reveal the distribution and the evolution of energetic  as they are injected into the ring current during geomagnetic storms, drift about the Earth on both open and closed drift paths, and decay through charge exchange to pre‐storm levels.\"\n\n【15】 #Airglows\nIn the International Space Station image at right, you can \"see green and yellow airglow paralleling the Earth’s horizon line (or limb) before it is overwhelmed by the light of the rising Sun.\nAirglow (also called nightglow) is the very weak emission of light by a planetary atmosphere. In the case of Earth's atmosphere, this optical phenomenon causes the night sky to never be completely dark (even after the effects of starlight and diffused sunlight from the far side are removed).\n\n【16】 #Auroras\n\"When the charged particles from the Sun penetrate Earth's magnetic shield, they are channelled downwards along the magnetic field lines until they strike atoms of gas high in the atmosphere. Like a giant fluorescent neon lamp, the interaction with excited oxygen atoms generates a green or, more rarely, red glow in the night sky, while excited nitrogen atoms yield blue and purple colours.\"\n\"Pulsating auroras are so-called because their features shift and brighten in distinct patches, rather than elongated arcs across the sky like active auroras. However, their appearance isn't the only difference. Though all auroras are caused by energetic particles--typically electrons--speeding down into Earth's atmosphere and colliding brilliantly with the atoms and molecules in the air, the source of these electrons is different for pulsating auroras and active auroras.\"\nThe \"density of neutral atoms within the atmosphere can change throughout the day because of heating by sunlight, the original understanding was that the heating—and the extra-dense layers of neutral particles—was driven horizontally. However, some satellites have hit speed bumps as they have orbited through Earth’s magnetic cusp—their acceleration briefly slowed, which indicates a small vertical slice of higher-density neutral atoms that are harder to travel through.\"\n\"Auroras are produced by solar storms that eject clouds of energetic charged particles. These particles are deflected when they encounter the Earth’s magnetic field, but in the process large electric voltages are created. Electrons trapped in the Earth’s magnetic field are accelerated by these voltages and spiral along the magnetic field into the polar regions. There they collide with atoms high in the atmosphere and emit X-rays\".\n- \"Type A aurora (green with red tops):\n1. colors due to emission by atomic oxygen\n2. red color due to emission by atomic oxygen (as in Type A)\n- Proton aurora:\n3. additional red and blue from atomic hydrogen emission\"\n\"This view  of the Aurora Australis, or Southern Lights, which was photographed by an astronaut aboard Space Shuttle Discovery (STS-39) in 1991, shows a spiked band of red and green aurora above the Earth's Limb. Calculated to be at altitudes ranging from 80 - 120 km (approx. 50-80 miles), the auroral light shown is due to the \"excitation\" of atomic oxygen in the upper atmosphere by charged particles (electrons) streaming down from the magnetosphere above.\"\n\n【17】 #Mars\n\"The major atmospheric gases on Earth, Venus, and Mars were probably CO2, H2O, and N2.  are often suprathermal, and their interactions can produce suprathermal neutral atoms as well  ionopause  separates the bound ionosphere from an outer region in which the solar wind is diverted and flows around and past the planet. This region still contains some neutral gas, and if such atoms are ionized by solar photons or electron impact, they are swept up in the flow.\"\nMethane is found in the Martian atmosphere, first image at right, by carefully observing the planet throughout several Mars years with NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility and the W.M. Keck telescope, both at Mauna Kea, Hawaii.\nAt right is an X-ray image of Mars. X-radiation from the Sun excites oxygen atoms in the Martian upper atmosphere, about 120 km above its surface, to emit X-ray fluorescence. A faint X-ray halo that extends out to 7,000 km above the surface of Mars has also been found.\n\n【18】 #Callisto\nAt right is a complete global color image of Callisto. Bright scars on a darker surface testify to a long history of impacts on Jupiter's moon Callisto. The picture, taken in May 2001, is the only complete global color image of Callisto obtained by Galileo, which has been orbiting Jupiter since December 1995. Of Jupiter's four largest moons, Callisto orbits farthest from the giant planet. Callisto's surface is uniformly cratered but is not uniform in color or brightness. Scientists believe the brighter areas are mainly ice and the darker areas are highly eroded, ice-poor material.\nCallisto's ionosphere was first detected during Galileo flybys; its high electron density of 7–17 x 104 cm−3 cannot be explained by the photoionization of the atmospheric carbon dioxide alone.\n\n【19】 #Jupiter\n\"Spectra from the Voyager I IRIS experiment confirm the existence of enhanced infrared emission near Jupiter's north magnetic pole in March 1979.\" \"Some species previously detected on Jupiter, including CH3D, C2H2, and C2H6, have been observed again near the pole. Newly discovered species, not previously observed on Jupiter, include C2H4, C3H4, and C6H6. All of these species except CH3D appear to have enhanced abundances at the north polar region with respect to midlatitudes.\"\n\"These images  show the distribution of the organic molecule acetylene at the north and south poles of Jupiter, based on data obtained by NASA's Cassini spacecraft in early January 2001. It is the highest-resolution map of acetylene to date on Jupiter. The enhanced emission results both from the warmer temperatures in the auroral hot spots, and probably also from an enhanced abundance in these regions. The detection helps scientists understand the chemical interactions between sunlight and molecules in Jupiter's stratosphere.\"\n\n【20】 #Europa\nEuropa has a tenuous atmosphere composed primarily of oxygen.\nObservations with the Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph of the Hubble Space Telescope, first described in 1995, revealed that Europa has a tenuous atmosphere composed mostly of  molecular oxygen (O2). The surface pressure of Europa's atmosphere is 0.1 μPa, or 10−12 times that of the Earth. In 1997, the Galileo spacecraft confirmed the presence of a tenuous ionosphere (an upper-atmospheric layer of charged particles) around Europa created by solar radiation and energetic particles from Jupiter's magnetosphere, providing evidence of an atmosphere.\nThe molecular hydrogen that escapes Europa's gravity, along with atomic and molecular oxygen, forms a torus (ring) of gas in the vicinity of Europa's orbit around Jupiter.  This \"neutral cloud\" has been detected by both the Cassini and Galileo spacecraft, and has a greater content (number of atoms and molecules) than the neutral cloud surrounding Jupiter's inner moon Io. Models predict that almost every atom or molecule in Europa's torus is eventually ionized, thus providing a source to Jupiter's magnetospheric plasma.\n\n【21】 #Io\n\"The camera on Cassini captured images of eclipsed Io in several colors ranging from the near-ultraviolet to the near-infrared. A black-and-white movie clip of 48 clear-filter frames spanning two hours during the eclipse was released on February 5 (PIA02882). Here, two colors have been added to show the type of evidence used by imaging scientists in determining the source of Io's auroral glows. The color pictures were taken at lower resolution -- 120 kilometers (75 miles) per pixel rather than 60 kilometers(37 miles) per pixel -- and less frequently than the clear-filter images. White dots near the equator are volcanoes, some of which are much brighter than the faint atmospheric glows. The brightest of them is the volcano Pele.\"\n\"Emissions of light (at wavelengths of 595 to 645 nanometers) likely arise from a tenuous atmosphere of oxygen. These glows would appear red to the eye and are consequently colored red in the movie. Emissions in near-ultraviolet wavelengths (between 300 and 380 nanometers), corresponding wavelength to the bright blue visible glows one would expect from sulfur dioxide. They have been colored blue in the movie. The blue glows are restricted to areas deep down in the atmosphere near the surface of Io, while the red glows are much more extensive, reaching heights of up to 900 kilometers (560 miles). This would be expected if the blue glows are indeed produced by sulfur dioxide, since sulfur dioxide molecules are heavier than oxygen atoms, so are more closely bound to the surface by gravity. The prominent blue and red regions near the equator of Io dance across the moon with the changing orientation of Jupiter's magnetic field, illustrating the relationship between Io's auroras and the electric currents that excite them.\"\n\"A faint blue emission is visible near the north pole of Io, possibly due to a volcanic plume erupting from the volcano Tvashtar at high northern latitude on the side of Io opposite Cassini. This eruption, observed by both Galileo and Cassini, left an enormous red ring around Tvashtar, visible in image PIA02588, released on March 29, 2001.\"\n\n【22】 #Saturn\n\"The view  from Hubble , taken on March 22, 2004, is so sharp that many individual Saturnian ringlets can be seen.\"\n\"Hubble's exquisite optics, coupled with the high resolution of its Advanced Camera for Surveys, allow it to take pictures of Saturn which are nearly as sharp as Cassini's, even though Hubble is nearly a billion miles farther from Saturn than Cassini.\"\n\"Camera exposures in four filters (blue, blue-green, green, and red) were combined to form the Hubble image, to render colors similar to what the eye would see through a telescope focused on Saturn. The subtle pastel colors of ammonia-methane clouds trace a variety of atmospheric dynamics. Saturn displays its familiar banded structure, and haze and clouds of various altitudes. Like Jupiter, all bands are parallel to Saturn's equator. Even the magnificent rings, at nearly their maximum tilt toward Earth, show subtle hues, which indicate the trace chemical differences in their icy composition.\"\n\n【23】 #Titan\n\"As spring continues to unfold at Saturn, April showers on the planet's largest moon, Titan, have brought methane rain to its equatorial deserts . Extensive rain from large cloud systems . has apparently darkened the surface of the moon.\"\n“It's amazing to be watching such familiar activity as rainstorms and seasonal changes in weather patterns on a distant, icy satellite\".\n\"Clouds on Titan are formed of methane as part of an Earth-like cycle that uses methane instead of water. On Titan, methane fills lakes on the surface, saturates clouds in the atmosphere, and falls as rain. Though there is evidence that liquids have flowed on the surface at Titan's equator in the past, liquid hydrocarbons, such as methane and ethane, had only been observed on the surface in lakes at polar latitudes. The vast expanses of dunes that dominate Titan's equatorial regions require a predominantly arid climate.\"\n\"An arrow-shaped storm appeared in the equatorial regions on Sept. 27, 2010 -- the equivalent of early April in Titan's “year” -- and a broad band of clouds appeared the next month, A 193,000-square-mile  region along the southern boundary of Titan’s Belet dune field, as well as smaller areas nearby, had become darker, this change in brightness is most likely the result of surface wetting by methane rain.\"\n“These outbreaks may be the Titan equivalent of what creates Earth's tropical rainforest climates, even though the delayed reaction to the change of seasons and the apparently sudden shift is more reminiscent of Earth's behavior over the tropical oceans than over tropical land areas”.\nAt right is an image that shows clouds over the equatorial region of Titan.\n\"Methane clouds in the troposphere, the lowest part of the atmosphere, appear white here and are mostly near Titan's equator. The darkest areas are surface features that have a low albedo, meaning they do not reflect much light. Cassini observations of clouds like these provide evidence of a seasonal shift of Titan's weather systems to low latitudes following the August 2009 equinox in the Saturnian system. (During equinox, the sun lies directly over the equator.  PIA11667 to learn how the sun's illumination of the Saturnian system changed during the equinox transition to spring in the northern hemispheres and to fall in the southern hemispheres of the planet and its moons.)\"\n\"In 2004, during Titan's late southern summer, extensive cloud systems were common in Titan's south polar region . Since 2005, southern polar systems have been observed infrequently, and one year after the equinox, extensive near-equatorial clouds have been seen. This image was taken on Oct. 18, 2010, a little more than one Earth year after the Saturnian equinox, which happens once in roughly 15 Earth years.\"\n\"The cloud patterns observed from late southern summer to early southern fall on Titan suggest that Titan's global atmospheric circulation is influenced by both the atmosphere and the surface. The temperature of the surface responds more rapidly to changes in illumination than does the thick atmosphere. Outbreaks such as the clouds seen here may be the Titan equivalent of what creates the Earth's tropical rainforest climates, even though the delayed reaction to the change of seasons and the apparently sudden shift is more reminiscent of the behavior over Earth's tropical oceans than over tropical land areas.\"\nThe climate—including wind and rain—creates surface features similar to those of Earth, such as sand dunes, rivers, lakes and seas (probably of liquid methane and ethane), and deltas, and is dominated by seasonal weather patterns as on Earth. With its liquids (both surface and subsurface) and robust nitrogen atmosphere, Titan's methane cycle is viewed as an analog to Earth's water cycle, although at a much lower temperature.\n\"These mosaics  of the south pole of Saturn's moon Titan, made from images taken almost one year apart, show changes in dark areas that may be lakes filled by seasonal rains of liquid hydrocarbons.\"\n\"It is likely that rain from a large storm created the new dark areas that were observed in June 2005. Some features, such as Ontario Lacus, show differences in brightness between the two observations that are the result of differences in illumination between the two observations. These mosaics use images taken in infrared light at a wavelength of 938 nanometers. The images have been oriented with the south pole in the center (black cross) and the 0 degree meridian toward the top. Image resolutions are several kilometers (several miles) per pixel.\"\n\"Evidence from Cassini's imaging science subsystem, radar, and visual and infrared mapping spectrometer instruments strongly suggests that dark areas near the poles are lakes of liquid hydrocarbons-an analysis affirmed by images capturing those changes in the lakes thought to be brought on by rainfall.\"\n\n【24】 #Uranus\nUranus has a complex, layered cloud structure, with methane thought to make up the uppermost layer of clouds. With a large telescope of 25 cm or wider, cloud patterns may be visible. When Voyager 2 flew by Uranus in 1986, it observed a total of ten cloud features across the entire planet. Besides the large-scale banded structure, Voyager 2 observed ten small bright clouds, most lying several degrees to the north from the collar.\nIn the 1990s, the number of the observed bright cloud features grew considerably partly because new high resolution imaging techniques became available. Most were found in the northern hemisphere as it started to become visible. An early explanation - that bright clouds are easier to identify in the dark part of the planet, whereas in the southern hemisphere the bright collar masks them - was shown to be incorrect: the actual number of features has indeed increased considerably. Nevertheless there are differences between the clouds of each hemisphere. The northern clouds are smaller, sharper and brighter. They appear to lie at a higher altitude. The lifetime of clouds spans several orders of magnitude. Some small clouds live for hours, while at least one southern cloud may have persisted since Voyager flyby. Recent observation also discovered that cloud features on Uranus have a lot in common with those on Neptune. For example, the dark spots common on Neptune had never been observed on Uranus before 2006, when the first such feature dubbed Uranus Dark Spot was imaged. The speculation is that Uranus is becoming more Neptune-like during its equinoctial season.\nFor a short period from March to May 2004, a number of large clouds appeared in the Uranian atmosphere, giving it a Neptune-like appearance.\nOn August 23, 2006, researchers at the Space Science Institute (Boulder, CO) and the University of Wisconsin observed a dark spot on Uranus's surface, giving astronomers more insight into the planet's atmospheric activity.\nThe bright collar at −45° latitude is also connected with methane clouds. Other changes in the southern polar region can be explained by changes in the lower cloud layers.\nThe wind speeds on Uranus can reach 250 meters per second (900 km/h, 560 mph). The tracking of numerous cloud features allowed determination of zonal winds blowing in the upper troposphere of Uranus. At the equator winds are retrograde, which means that they blow in the reverse direction to the planetary rotation. Their speeds are from −100 to −50 m/s. Wind speeds increase with the distance from the equator, reaching zero values near ±20° latitude, where the troposphere's temperature minimum is located. Closer to the poles, the winds shift to a prograde direction, flowing with the planet's rotation. Windspeeds continue to increase reaching maxima at ±60° latitude before falling to zero at the poles. Windspeeds at −40° latitude range from 150 to 200 m/s. Since the collar obscures all clouds below that parallel, speeds between it and the southern pole are impossible to measure. In contrast, in the northern hemisphere maximum speeds as high as 240 m/s are observed near +50 degrees of latitude, Observations included record-breaking wind speeds of 229 m/s (824 km/h) and a persistent thunderstorm referred to as \"Fourth of July fireworks\".\n\n【25】 #Neptune\nA trace amount of methane is also present. Prominent absorption bands of methane occur at wavelengths above 600 nm, in the red and infrared portion of the spectrum. As with Uranus, this absorption of red light by the atmospheric methane is part of what gives Neptune its blue hue, although Neptune's vivid azure differs from Uranus's milder cyan. Since Neptune's atmospheric methane content is similar to that of Uranus, some unknown atmospheric constituent is thought to contribute to Neptune's colour.\n\n【26】 #Protoplanetary disks\nAmong their findings are discoveries of a wide range of organic compounds, including two that contain biologically usable nitrogen. Indigenous aliphatic hydrocarbons were found with longer chain lengths than those observed in the diffuse interstellar medium. The Stardust samples contain abundant amorphous silicates in addition to crystalline silicates such as olivine and pyroxene. The presence of crystalline silicates in Wild 2 is consistent with mixing of solar system and interstellar matter, something which had been deduced spectroscopically before . No hydrous silicates or carbonate minerals were detected, which suggests a lack of aqueous processing of Wild 2 dust. Very few pure carbon (CHON) particles were found in the samples returned.\"\n\n【27】 #Hills clouds\nThe Hills cloud (also called the inner Oort cloud and inner cloud) is a vast theoretical circumstellar disc, interior to the Oort cloud, whose outer border would be located at around 20,000 to 30,000 AU from the Sun, and whose inner border, less well-defined, is hypothetically located at 250-1500 AU, well beyond planetary and Kuiper Belt object orbits - but distances might be much greater. If it exists, the Hills cloud contains roughly 5 times as many comets as the Oort cloud.\nObjects ejected from the Hills cloud are likely to end up in the classical Oort cloud region, maintaining the Oort cloud.\nThe existence of the Hills cloud is plausible, since many bodies have been found already. It would be denser than the Oort cloud.\nComets may be rooted in a cloud orbiting the outer boundary of the Solar System.\nComets are usually destroyed after several passes through the inner Solar System, so if any had existed for several billion years (since the beginning of the Solar System), no more could be observed now. The distribution of the inverse of the semi-major axes showed a maximum frequency which suggested the existence of a reservoir of comets between 40,000  (Expression error: Unexpected round operator. ) away. This reservoir, located at the limits of the Sun's sphere of astrodynamic influence, would be subject to stellar disturbances, likely to expel cloud comets outwards or inwards.\nMost estimates place the population of the Hills cloud at about 20 trillion (about five to ten times that of the outer cloud), although the number could be ten times greater than that. The orbits of most cloud comets have a semi-major axis of 10,000 AU, much closer to the Sun than the proposed distance of the Oort cloud. Moreover, the influence of the surrounding stars and that of the galactic tide should have sent the Oort cloud comets either closer to the Sun or outside of the Solar System. The presence of an inner cloud, which would have tens or hundreds of times as many cometary nuclei as the outer halo was proposed.\nThe majority of comets in the Solar System were located not in the Oort cloud area, but closer and in an internal cloud, with an orbit with a semi-major axis of 5,000 AU.\nIt is likely that the Hills cloud is the largest concentration of comets across the Solar System. The Hills cloud is much denser than the outer Oort cloud; it is somewhere between 5,000 and 20,000 AU in size. In contrast, the Oort cloud is between 20,000  (Expression error: Unexpected round operator. ) in size.\nThe vast majority of Hills cloud objects consists of various ices, such as water, methane, ethane, carbon monoxide and hydrogen cyanide. However, the discovery of the object 1996 PW, an asteroid on a typical orbit of a long-period comet, suggests that the cloud may also contain rocky objects.\nThe Oort cloud is divided into two regions: a circumstellar disc-shaped inner Oort cloud (or Hills cloud) and a circumstellar envelope, spherical outer Oort cloud. Both regions lie beyond the heliosphere and in interstellar space.\nVoyager 1, the fastest and farthest of the interplanetary space probes currently leaving the Solar System, will reach the Oort cloud in about 300 years and would take about 30,000 years to pass through it. However, around 2025, the radioisotope thermoelectric generators on Voyager 1 will no longer supply enough power to operate any of its scientific instruments, preventing any further exploration by Voyager 1.\nDef. a \"roughly spherical region of space composed of comet-like bodies and other minor planets and asteroids that orbit distantly in planetary systems\" is called an Oort cloud.\n\n【28】 #50000 Quaoar\n50000 Quaoar, provisional designation 2002 LM60, is a non-resonant trans-Neptunian object (classical Kuiper belt object, or cubewano) and a possible dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt, a region of icy planetesimals beyond Neptune measuring approximately 1,100 km (683.5083112 mi) in diameter, about half the diameter of Pluto, discovered at the Palomar Observatory on 6 June 2002. Signs of water ice on the surface of Quaoar have been found, which suggests that cryovolcanism may be occurring on Quaoar. A small amount of methane is present on its surface, which can only be retained by the largest Kuiper belt objects. In February 2007, Weywot, a synchronous minor-planet moon in orbit around Quaoar, was discovered by Brown. Weywot is measured to be 80 km (49.70969536 mi) across. Both objects were named after mythological figures from the Native American Tongva people in Southern California. Quaoar is the Tongva creator deity and Weywot is his son.\nThe earliest precovery, or prediscovery image, of Quaoar was found on a photographic plate imaged on 25 May 1954 from the Palomar Observatory Sky Survey.\nQuaoar's albedo or reflectivity could be as low as 0.1, which would still be much higher than the lower estimate of 0.04 for 20000 Varuna. This may indicate that fresh ice has disappeared from Quaoar's surface. The surface is moderately red, meaning that Quaoar is relatively more reflective in the red and near-infrared spectrum than in the blue. The Kuiper belt objects Varuna and Ixion are also moderately red in the spectral class. Larger Kuiper belt objects are often much brighter because they are covered in more fresh ice and have a higher albedo, and thus they present a neutral color. A 2006 model of internal heating via radioactive decay suggested that, unlike 90482 Orcus, Quaoar may not be capable of sustaining an internal ocean of liquid water at the mantle–core boundary.\nThe presence of methane and other volatiles on Quaoar's surface suggest that it may support a tenuous atmosphere produced from the sublimation of volatiles. With a measured mean temperature of ~ 44 K (−229.15 °C), the upper limit of Quaoar's atmospheric pressure is expected to be in the range of a few microbars. Due to Quaoar's small size and mass, the possibility of Quaoar having an atmosphere of nitrogen and carbon monoxide has been ruled out, since the gases would escape from Quaoar. The possibility of a methane atmosphere still remains, with the upper limit being less than 1 microbar. In 2013, Quaoar occulted a 15.8 magnitude star and revealed no sign of a substantial atmosphere, placing an upper limit to at least 20 nanobars, under the assumption that Quaoar's mean temperature is 42 K (−231.15 °C) and that its atmosphere consists of mostly methane.\nQuaoar is thought to be an oblate spheroid around 1,100 km (683.5083112 mi) in diameter, being slightly flattened in shape. The estimates come from observations of Quaoar as it occulted a 15.8 magnitude star in 2013. Given that Quaoar has an estimated oblateness value of 6998897000000000000♠0.0897±0.006 and a measured equatorial diameter of 7006113800000000000♠1138+48−34 km, Quaoar is believed to be in hydrostatic equilibrium, being described as a Maclaurin spheroid. Quaoar is about as large and massive as (if somewhat smaller than) Pluto's moon Charon. Quaoar is roughly half the size of Pluto.\n\n【29】 #Interstellar medium\nThe \"many other types of radio sources in our galaxy  include so-called radio stars, emission nebula, flare stars and pulsars.  Pulsars were first discovered in 1967 by Cambridge post-graduate student Jocelyn Bell as she processed charts associated with an unrelated project to study twinkling radio sources. She noticed recurrent signals when the antenna was pointed in a certain direction. Further study revealed a precise timing interval of about 1 second. It also was found that the pulses were dispersed such that the lower frequencies arrived later than the higher frequencies. This dispersion could be attributed to scattering of the radiation by interstellar electrons and, if so, could provide an indication of the pulsar distance.\"\n\"A particular subject of interest is the cluster ion series (NH3)nNH4+, since it is the dominant group of ions over the whole investigated temperature range.\" For astrochemisty, \"hese studies are expected to throw light on the sputtering from planetary and interstellar ices and the possible formation of new organic molecules in CO--NH3–H2O ice by megaelectronvolt ion bombardment.\"\n\"lnterstellar scintillation (ISS), fluctuations in the amplitude and phase of radio waves caused by scattering in the interstellar medium, is important as a diagnostic of interstellar plasma turbulence. ISS is also of interest because it is noise for other radio astronomical observations.  The unifying concern is the power spectrum of the interstellar electron density.\"\n\"From measurements of angular broadening of pulsars and extragalactic sources, decorrelation bandwidth of pulsars, refractive steering of features in pulsar dynamic spectra, dispersion measure fluctuations of pulsars, and refractive scintillation index measurements,  a composite structure function that is approximately power law over 2 x 106 m < scale < 1013 m . The data are consistent with the structure function having a logarithmic slope versus baseline Iess than 2; thus there is a meaningful connection between scales in the radiowave fluctuation field and the scales in the electron density field causing the scattering.\"\nA \"composite electron density spectrum  approximately power law over at least the ≈ 5 decade wavenumber range 10-13 m-1 < wavenumber < 10-8 m-1 and that may extend to higher wavenumbers.\"\n\n【30】 #Interstellar clouds\nDef. an increase in the hydrogen density (nH) of the interstellar medium from ~ 0.01 H cm-3 to ≳ 0.1 H cm-3 is called an interstellar cloud.\nThe cyanide radical (called cyanogen) is used to measure the temperature of interstellar gas clouds.\n\"Carbon monoxide is the second most abundant molecule, after H2, in interstellar clouds. In diffuse clouds, the amount of CO is mainly derived from measurements of absorption at UV wavelengths.\"\n\n【31】 #Circumstellar clouds\nDef. an interstellar-like cloud apparently surrounding or in orbit around a star is called a circumstellar cloud.\n\"VY Canis Majoris  an irregular pulsating variable  lies about 5,000 light-years away in the constellation Canis Major.\"\n\"Although VY Can is about half a million times as luminous as the Sun, much of its visible light is absorbed by a large, asymmetric cloud of dust particles that has been ejected from the star in various outbursts over the past 1,000 years or so. The infrared emission from this dust cloud makes VY Can one of the brightest objects in the sky at wavelengths of 5–20 microns.\"\n\"In 2007, a team of astronomers using the 10-meter radio dish on Mount Graham, in Arizona, found that VY Can's extended circumstellar cloud is a prolific molecule-making factory. Among the radio emissions identified were those of hydrogen cyanide (HCN), silicon monoxide (SiO), sodium chloride (NaCl) and a molecule, phosphorus nitride (PN), in which a phosphorus atom and a nitrogen atom are bound together. Phosphorus-bearing molecules are of particular interest to astrobiologists because phosphorus is relatively rare in the universe, yet it is a key ingredient in molecules that are central to life as we know it, including the nuclei acids DNA and RNA and the energy-storage molecule, ATP. \"\n\"Material ejected by the star is visible in this 2004 image  captured by the Hubble Space Telescope's Advanced Camera for Surveys, using polarizing filters.\"\nFor comparison, the second image down on the right is captured using visuals.\n\n【32】 #Star-forming regions\n\"Newborn stars peek out from beneath their natal blanket of dust in this dynamic image of the Rho Ophiuchi dark cloud  from NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope. Called \"Rho Oph\" by astronomers, it's one of the closest star-forming regions to our own solar system. Located near the constellations Scorpius and Ophiuchus, the nebula is about 407 light years away from Earth.\"\n\"Rho Oph is a complex made up of a large main cloud of molecular hydrogen, a key molecule allowing new stars to form from cold cosmic gas, with two long streamers trailing off in different directions. Recent studies using the latest X-ray and infrared observations reveal more than 300 young stellar objects within the large central cloud. Their median age is only 300,000 years, very young compared to some of the universe's oldest stars, which are more than 12 billion years old.\"\n\"This false-color image of Rho Oph's main cloud, Lynds 1688, was created with data from Spitzer's infrared array camera, which has the highest spatial resolution of Spitzer's three imaging instruments. Blue represents 3.6 micron light, green is 4.5 micron light, orange is 5.8, and red is 8.0. The multiple wavelengths reveal different aspects of the dust surrounding and between the embedded stars, yielding information about the stars and their birthplace.\"\n\n【33】 #Wolf-Rayet stars\n\"At the low density given by the spherically symmetric wind model , the dominant species in the gas are atomic ions while as the gas number density increases, the recombination of ions takes place and the gas composition is governed by neutral-phase chemistry, that is, the dominant species are neutral atoms and molecules although electrons and some ions are still present in relatively large amounts (for example, C+, O+ and He+).\"\n\n【34】 #Spectroscopy\nBy comparing astronomical observations with laboratory measurements, astrochemists can infer the elemental abundances, chemical composition, and temperatures of stars and interstellar clouds. This is possible because ions, atoms, and molecules have characteristic spectra: that is, the absorption and emission of certain wavelengths (colors) of light, often not visible to the human eye. However, these measurements have limitations, with various types of radiation (radio, infrared, visible, ultraviolet etc.) able to detect only certain types of species, depending on the chemical properties of the molecules.

These treatments include chemicals, mixtures, herbs, devices, and manual procedures. They are generally not supported by evidence, either through lack of testing or through lack of statistically significant positive results. Concerns have been raised about the safety of certain treatments.\nSuch therapies can be categorized broadly into three groups: unproven cancer treatments that are offered as a substitute to standard cancer treatment; alternative treatments offered as a complement to standard cancer treatment rather than as a substitute; or treatments which have been proposed in the past, but which with testing in clinical trials were found not to be efficacious. Some of these obsolete or disproven treatments continue to be promoted, sold, and used.\n\n【2】 #Background\nMedical science has made major advances in the treatment of cancer, from the development of chemotherapy in the 1940s through the recognition of the importance of adjuvant therapy and the development of newer targeted therapies. Nonetheless, cancer remains a common, frightening, and often incurable disease, and the side effects of chemotherapy and other cancer treatments can range from unpleasant to potentially fatal. These factors can increase the appeal of alternative treatments for cancer, which propose to offer fewer side effects and greater effectiveness than standard therapies. \"Alternative\" cancer treatments are typically those which have not undergone the rigorous scientific and clinical testing expected by the medical community. These cancer therapies appear and vanish frequently, and have throughout history.\nToday, about half of the practitioners who dispense alternative treatments are physicians, although they tend to be generalists rather than oncologists. As many as 60% of physicians have referred their patients to a complementary or alternative practitioner.\nComplementary and alternative cancer treatments are often grouped together, but this grouping is controversial. Complementary treatments may receive more support within the mainstream medical community. A 2006 systematic review of the effectiveness of these techniques in reducing pain concluded that although several seemed promising, conclusive evidence was lacking.\nThe most popular alternative cancer therapies are nutritional, including the macrobiotic diet, and other therapies include mind-body intervention, bioelectromagnetics, various biologic/pharmacologic treatments, and herbs. The popularity and prevalence of different treatments varies widely by region.\nA 2006 systematic review 214 articles covering 198 clinical trials of alternative medicines concluded that many did not properly analyze the proper doses. It also reported that the methodology of many of the studies \"is open to criticism\".\n\n【3】 #Examples of alternative treatment\nVery few suppliers of alternative medicines have undertaken scientifically controlled clinical trials for their products, although occasional preliminary testing, or testing as adjuvant therapy, has been performed.  For this reason, alternative therapies generally rely on testimonial or anecdotal evidence. In the United States, FDA regulations forbid the makers of unproven products from claiming efficacy against cancer.\nThe US FTC recently acted against companies that made unsupported claims that their products, some of which included highly toxic chemicals, could cure cancer.

{"seq_id": "6105579a-ab2c-4ba4-bdb3-0605d6485366", "title": null, "text": "【0】 Calcitriol (oral)\n\n【1】 #Overview\nCalcitriol (oral) is a bone density conservation agent that is FDA approved for the treatment of hypocalcemia due to postsurgical or idiopathic hypoparathyroidism, pseudohypoparathyroidism, chronic renal dialysis; secondary hyperparathyroidism, and mild to moderate plaque psoriasis. Common adverse reactions include hypercalcemia.\n\n【2】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Adult)\n- Calcitriol is indicated in the management of hypocalcemia and its clinical manifestations in patients with postsurgical hypoparathyroidism, idiopathic hypoparathyroidism, and pseudohypoparathyroidism.\n- Dosing Information\n- The recommended initial oral dose for the treatment of hypocalcemia associated with hypoparathyroidism is 0.25 microgram/day administered in the morning. The dose may be increased at 2- to 4-week intervals. Most patients respond to doses in the range of 0.5 to 2 micrograms/day. The effectiveness of calcitriol is dependent on an adequate daily intake of calcium.\n- It has been noted that patients with only slightly reduced serum calcium levels may respond to 0.25 microgram every other day. Most patients undergoing hemodialysis require 0.5 to 1 microgram/day The effectiveness of calcitriol is dependent on an adequate daily intake of calcium.\n\n【3】 ### Secondary hyperparathyroidism\n- Calcitriol is indicated in the management of secondary hyperparathyroidism and resultant metabolic bone disease in patients with moderate to severe chronic renal failure (Ccr 15 to 55 mL/min) not yet on dialysis. In children, the creatinine clearance value must be corrected for a surface area of 1.73 square meters. A serum iPTH level of ≥ 100 pg/mL is strongly suggestive of secondary hyperparathyroidism.\n- Dosing information\n- Intermittent subcutaneous bolus doses of calcitriol 2 micrograms (initial dose) administered in the abdominal region after each hemodialysis session were effective in controlling secondary hyperparathyroidism in 10 patients. Calcium acetate 2.5 to 4 grams/day was added as a phosphorus binder. During the 6-month study period, both calcitriol and calcium acetate were adjusted according to calcium, phosphorus, and parathyroid hormone serum concentrations. By the end of the study, doses were subcutaneous calcitriol 4 micrograms/week and calcium acetate 7 to 8 grams/day.\n\n【4】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Calcitriol in adult patients.\n\n【5】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Calcitriol in adult patients.\n\n【6】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Pediatric)\n- Dosing Information\n- The recommended initial oral dose for the treatment of hypoparathyroidism is 0.25 microgram/day administered in the morning accompanied by an adequate intake of elemental calcium. The dose may be increased at 2- to 4-week intervals. Most children 6 years and older have responded to doses in the range of 0.5 to 2 micrograms/day, while most children age 1 to 5 respond to 0.25 to 0.75 microgram/day.\n\n【7】 ### Hypocalcemia - Renal dialysis (Chronic)\n- Dosing information\n- The recommended initial oral dose for the treatment of pseudphypoparathyroidism is 0.25 microgram/day administered in the morning accompanied by an adequate intake of elemental calcium. The dose may be increased at 2- to 4-week intervals. Most children 6 years and older have responded to doses in the range of 0.5 to 2 micrograms/day.\n\n【8】 ### Secondary hyperparathyroidism\n- Dosing information\n- (predialysis; oral) 3 years of age and older; initial, 0.25 mcg ORALLY daily; may be increased to 0.5 mcg/day.\n\n【9】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Calcitriol in pediatric patients.\n\n【10】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Calcitriol in pediatric patients.\n\n【11】 #Contraindications\n- Calcitriol capsules should not be given to patients with hypercalcemia or evidence of vitamin D toxicity. Use of calcitriol capsules in patients with known hypersensitivity to calcitriol (or drugs of the same class) or any of the inactive ingredients is contraindicated.\n\n【12】 - Overdosage of any form of vitamin D is dangerous . Progressive hypercalcemia due to overdosage of vitamin D and its metabolites may be so severe as to require emergency attention. Chronic hypercalcemia can lead to generalized vascular calcification, nephrocalcinosis and other soft-tissue calcification. The serum calcium times phosphate (Ca x P) product should not be allowed to exceed 70 mg2/dL2. Radiographic evaluation of suspect anatomical regions may be useful in the early detection of this condition.\n- Calcitriol increases inorganic phosphate levels in serum. While this is desirable in patients with hypophosphatemia, caution is called for in patients with renal failure because of the danger of ectopic calcification. A non-aluminum phosphate-binding compound and a low-phosphate diet should be used to control serum phosphorus levels in patients undergoing dialysis.\n- Magnesium-containing preparations (e.g. antacids) and calcitriol should not be used concomitantly in patients on chronic renal dialysis because such use may lead to the development of hypermagnesemia.\n- Studies in dogs and rats given calcitriol for up to 26 weeks have shown that small increases of calcitriol above endogenous levels can lead to abnormalities of calcium metabolism with the potential for calcification of many tissues in the body.\n\n【13】 ### PRECAUTIONS\n- General:\n- Excessive dosage of calcitriol induces hypercalcemia and in some instances hypercalciuria; therefore, early in treatment during dosage adjustment, serum calcium should be determined twice weekly. In dialysis patients, a fall in serum alkaline phosphatase levels usually antedates the appearance of hypercalcemia and may be an indication of impending hypercalcemia. An abrupt increase in calcium intake as a result of changes in diet (e.g. increased consumption of dairy products) or uncontrolled intake of calcium preparations may trigger hypercalcemia.\n- Immobilized patients, e.g. those who have undergone surgery, are particularly exposed to the risk of hypercalcemia.\n- Patients with normal renal function taking calcitriol should avoid dehydration. Adequate fluid intake should be maintained.\n- Information for Patients:\n- The patient and his or her caregivers should be informed about compliance with dosage instructions, adherence to instructions about diet and calcium supplementation, and avoidance of the use of unapproved nonprescription drugs. Patients and their caregivers should also be carefully informed about the symptoms of hypercalcemia .\n- Laboratory Tests:\n- For dialysis patients, serum calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, and alkaline phosphatase should be determined periodically. For hypoparathyroid patients, serum calcium, phosphorus, and 24 hour urinary calcium should be determined periodically. For predialysis patients, serum calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, creatinine, and intact PTH (iPTH) should be determined initially. Thereafter, serum calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, and creatine should be determined monthly for a 6 month period and then determined periodically. Intact PTH (iPTH) should be determined periodically every 3 to 4 months at the time of visits. During the titration period of treatment with calcitriol, serum calcium levels should be checked at least twice weekly .\n\n【14】 ## Clinical Trials Experience\nSince calcitriol is believed to be the active hormone which exerts vitamin D activity in the body, adverse effects are, in general, similar to those encountered with excessive vitamin D intake, i.e. hypercalcemia syndrome or calcium intoxication (depending on the severity and duration of hypercalcemia) . Because of the short biological half-life of calcitriol, pharmacokinetic investigations have shown normalization of elevated serum calcium within a few days of treatment withdrawal, i.e. much faster than in treatment with vitamin D3 preparations.\n- The early and late signs and symptoms of vitamin D intoxication associated with hypercalcemia include:\n- Early: weakness, headache, somnolence, nausea, vomiting, dry mouth, constipation, muscle pain, bone pain, metallic taste, and anorexia, abdominal pain or stomach ache.\n- Late: polyuria, polydipsia, anorexia, weight loss, nocturia, conjunctivitis (calcific), pancreatitis, photophobia, rhinorrhea, pruritus, hyperthermia, decreased libido, elevated BUN, albuminuria, hypercholesterolemia, elevated SGOT (AST) and SGPT (ALT), ectopic calcification, nephrocalcinosis, hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, dystrophy, sensory disturbances, dehydration, apathy, arrested growth, urinary tract infections, and, rarely, overt psychosis.\n- In clinical studies on hypoparathyroidism and pseudohypoparathyroidism, hypercalcemia was noted on at least one occasion in about 1 in 3 patients and hypercalciuria in about 1 in 7 patients. Elevated serum creatinine levels were observed in about 1 in 6 patients (approximately one half of whom had normal levels at baseline).\n- In concurrent hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia, soft-tissue calcification may occur; this can be seen radiographically .\n- Hypersensitivity reactions (pruritus, rash, urticaria, and very rarely severe erythematous skin disorders) may occur in susceptible individuals. One case of erythema multiforme and one case of allergic reaction (swelling of lips and hives all over the body) were confirmed by rechallenge.\n\n【15】 ## Postmarketing Experience\nThere is limited information regarding Postmarketing Experience of Calcitriol (oral) in the drug label.\n\n【16】 #Drug Interactions\nCholestyramine\n- Cholestyramine has been reported to reduce intestinal absorption of fat-soluble vitamins; as such it may impair intestinal absorption of calcitriol,\nPhenytoin/Phenobarbital\n- The coadministration of phenytoin or phenobarbital will not affect plasma concentrations of calcitriol, but may reduce endogenous plasma levels of 25(OH)D3 by accelerating metabolism. Since blood level of calcitriol will be reduced, higher doses of calcitriol may be necessary if these drugs are administered simultaneously.\nThiazides\nDigitalis\nKetoconazole\n- Ketoconazole may inhibit both synthetic and catabolic enzymes of calcitriol. Reductions in serum endogenous calcitriol concentrations have been observed following the administration of 300 mg/day to 1200 mg/day ketoconazole for a week to healthy men. However, in vivo drug interaction studies of ketoconazole with calcitriol have not been investigated.\nCorticosteroids\n- A relationship of functional antagonism exists between vitamin D analogues, which promote calcium absorption, and corticosteroids, which inhibit calcium absorption.\nPhosphate-Binding Agents\n- Since calcitriol also has an effect on phosphate transport in the intestine, kidneys and bones, the dosage of phosphate-binding agents must be adjusted in accordance with the serum phosphate concentration.\nVitamin D\nCalcium Supplements\n- Uncontrolled intake of additional calcium-containing preparations should be avoided .\nMagnesium\n- Magnesium-containing preparations (e.g. antacids) may cause hypermagnesemia and should therefore not be taken during therapy with calcitriol by patients on chronic renal dialysis.\n\n【17】 ### Pregnancy\nPregnancy Category (FDA): C\n- Calcitriol has been found to be teratogenic in rabbits when given at doses of 0.08 and 0.3 mcg/kg (approximately 2 and 6 times the maximum recommended dose based on mg/m2). All 15 fetuses in 3 litters at these doses showed external and skeletal abnormalities. However, none of the other 23 litters (156 fetuses) showed external and skeletal abnormalities compared with controls.\nNonteratogenic Effects\n- In the rabbit, dosages of 0.3 mcg/kg/day (approximately 6 times maximum recommended dose based on surface area) administered on days 7 to 18 of gestation resulted in 19% maternal mortality, a decrease in mean fetal body weight and a reduced number of newborn surviving to 24 hours. A study of perinatal and postnatal development in rats resulted in hypercalcemia in the offspring of dams given calcitriol at doses of 0.08 or 0.3 mcg/kg/day (approximately 1 and 3 times the maximum recommended dose based on mg/m2), hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia in dams given calcitriol at a dose of 0.08 or 0.3 mcg/kg/day, and increased serum urea nitrogen in dams given calcitriol at a dose of 0.3 mcg/kg/day. In another study in rats, maternal weight gain was slightly reduced at a dose of 0.3 mcg/kg/day (approximately 3 times the maximum recommended dose based on mg/m2) administered on days 7 to 15 of gestation. The offspring of a woman administered 17 mcg/day to 36 mcg/day of calcitriol (approximately 17 to 36 times the maximum recommended dose), during pregnancy manifested mild hypercalcemia in the first 2 days of life which returned to normal at day 3.\n- Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) Pregnancy Category\nThere is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Calcitriol (oral) in women who are pregnant.\n\n【18】 ### Labor and Delivery\n- There is no FDA guidance on use of Calcitriol (oral) during labor and delivery.\n\n【19】 ### Nursing Mothers\n- Calcitriol from ingested calcitriol capsules may be excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from calcitriol in nursing infants, a mother should not nurse while taking calcitriol.\n\n【20】 ### Pediatric Use\n- Safety and effectiveness of calcitriol in pediatric patients undergoing dialysis have not been established. The safety and effectiveness of calcitriol in pediatric predialysis patients is based on evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of calcitriol in adults with predialysis chronic renal failure and additional supportive data from non-placebo controlled studies in pediatric patients. Dosing guidelines have not been established for pediatric patients under 1 year of age with hypoparathyroidism or for pediatric patients less than 6 years of age with pseudohypoparathyroidism.\n\n【21】 ### Geriatic Use\n- Clinical studies of calcitriol did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.\n\n【22】 ### Gender\n- There is no FDA guidance on the use of Calcitriol (oral) with respect to specific gender populations.\n\n【23】 ### Race\n- There is no FDA guidance on the use of Calcitriol (oral) with respect to specific racial populations.\n\n【24】 ### Renal Impairment\n- There is no FDA guidance on the use of Calcitriol (oral) in patients with renal impairment.\n\n【25】 ### Hepatic Impairment\n- There is no FDA guidance on the use of Calcitriol (oral) in patients with hepatic impairment.\n\n【26】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\n- There is no FDA guidance on the use of Calcitriol (oral) in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n\n【27】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\n- There is no FDA guidance one the use of Calcitriol (oral) in patients who are immunocompromised.\n\n【28】 ### Administration\n- The optimal daily dose of calcitriol capsules must be carefully determined for each patient. Calcitriol can be administered orally as a capsule (0.25 mcg or 0.50 mcg). Calcitriol therapy should always be started at the lowest possible dose and should not be increased without careful monitoring of serum calcium.\n- The effectiveness of calcitriol capsule therapy is predicated on the assumption that each patient is receiving an adequate but not excessive daily intake of calcium. Patients are advised to have a dietary intake of calcium at a minimum of 600 mg daily. The U.S. RDA for calcium in adults is 800 mg to 1200 mg. To ensure that each patient receives an adequate daily intake of calcium, the physician should either prescribe a calcium supplement or instruct the patient in proper dietary measures.\n- Because of improved calcium absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, some patients on calcitriol may be maintained on a lower calcium intake. Patients who tend to develop hypercalcemia may require only low doses of calcium or no supplementation at all.\nDialysis Patients\n- Patients with normal or only slightly reduced serum calcium levels may respond to calcitriol capsule doses of 0.25 mcg every other day. Most patients undergoing hemodialysis respond to doses between 0.5 and 1 mcg/day.\nHypoparathyroidism\n- Most adult patients and pediatric patients age 6 years and older have responded to dosages in the range of 0.5 mcg to 2 mcg daily. Pediatric patients in the 1 to 5 year age group with hypoparathyroidism have usually been given 0.25 mcg to 0.75 mcg daily. The number of treated patients with pseudohypoparathyroidism less than 6 years of age is too small to make dosage recommendations.\n- Malabsorption is occasionally noted in patients with hypoparathyroidism; hence, larger doses of calcitriol may be needed.\n- The recommended initial dosage of calcitriol is 0.25 mcg/day in adults and pediatric patients 3 years of age and older. This dosage may be increased if necessary to 0.5 mcg/day.\n- For pediatric patients less than 3 years of age, the recommended initial dosage of calcitriol is 10 to 15 ng/kg/day.\n\n【29】 ### Monitoring\n- Calcitriol therapy should always be started at the lowest possible dose and should not be increased without careful monitoring of the serum calcium. An estimate of daily dietary calcium intake should be made and the intake adjusted when indicated.\n\n【30】 #IV Compatibility\nThere is limited information regarding IV Compatibility of Calcitriol (oral) in the drug label.\n\n【31】 #Overdosage\n- Administration of calcitriol to patients in excess of their daily requirements can cause hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and hyperphosphatemia. Since calcitriol is a derivative of vitamin D, the signs and symptoms of overdose are the same as for an overdose of vitamin D . High intake of calcium and phosphate concomitant with calcitriol may lead to similar abnormalities. The serum calcium times phosphate (Ca x P) product should not be allowed to exceed 70 mg2/dL2. High levels of calcium in the dialysate bath may contribute to the hypercalcemia.\nTreatment of Hypercalcemia and Overdosage in Dialysis Patients and Hypoparathyroidism Patients\n- General treatment of hypercalcemia (greater than 1 mg/dL above the upper limit of the normal range) consists of immediate discontinuation of calcitriol therapy, institution of a low-calcium diet and withdrawal of calcium supplements. Serum calcium levels should be determined daily until normocalcemia ensues. Hypercalcemia frequently resolves in 2 to 7 days. When serum calcium levels have returned to within normal limits, calcitriol therapy may be reinstituted at a dose of 0.25 mcg/day less than prior therapy. Serum calcium levels should be obtained at least twice weekly after all dosage changes and subsequent dosage titration. In dialysis patients, persistent or markedly elevated serum calcium levels may be corrected by dialysis against a calcium-free dialysate.\n- If serum phosphorus levels exceed 5.0 mg/dL to 5.5 mg/dL, a calcium-containing phosphate-binding agent (i.e. calcium carbonate or calcium acetate) should be taken with meals. Serum phosphorus levels should be determined as described earlier . Aluminum-containing gels should be used with caution as phosphate-binding agents because of the risk of slow aluminum accumulation.\nTreatment of Accidental Overdosage of Calcitriol\n- The treatment of acute accidental overdosage of calcitriol should consist of general supportive measures. If drug ingestion is discovered within a relatively short time, induction of emesis or gastric lavage may be of benefit in preventing further absorption. If the drug has passed through the stomach, the administration of mineral oil may promote its fecal elimination. Serial serum electrolyte determinations (especially calcium), rate of urinary calcium excretion, and assessment of electrocardiographic abnormalities due to hypercalcemia should be obtained. Such monitoring is critical in patients receiving digitalis. Discontinuation of supplemental calcium and a low-calcium diet are also indicated in accidental overdosage. Due to the relatively short duration of the pharmacological action of calcitriol, further measures are probably unnecessary. Should, however, persistent and markedly elevated serum calcium levels occur, there are a variety of therapeutic alternatives which may be considered, depending on the patient’s underlying condition. These include the use of drugs such as phosphates and corticosteroids as well as measures to induce an appropriate forced diuresis. The use of peritoneal dialysis against a calcium-free dialysate has also been reported.\n\n【32】 ## Mechanism of Action\nThere is limited information regarding Calcitriol (oral) Mechanism of Action in the drug label.\n\n【33】 ## Structure\n- Calcitriol is a synthetic vitamin D analog which is active in the regulation of the absorption of calcium from the gastrointestinal tract and its utilization in the body. It is available as capsules containing 0.25 mcg or 0.5 mcg calcitriol. Each capsule also contains the following inactive ingredients: butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) as antioxidants, and triglycerides (medium chain). Gelatin capsule shell contains gelatin, glycerol, mannitol, red iron oxide, sorbitanhydrides, sorbitol, superior polyols, titanium dioxide and yellow iron oxide. Imprinting ink contains ammonium hydroxide, isopropyl alcohol, propylene glycol, shellac and titanium dioxide.\n- Calcitriol is a white, crystalline compound which occurs naturally in humans. It is soluble in organic solvents but relatively insoluble in water. Chemically, calcitriol is 9,10-seco(5Z,7E)-5,7,10-cholestatriene-1α,3β,25-triol and has the following structural formula:\n- The other names frequently used for calcitriol are 1α,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol, 1,25- dihydroxyvitamin D3, 1,25-DHCC, 1,25(OH)2D3 and 1,25-diOHC.\n\n【34】 ## Pharmacodynamics\n- The two known sites of action of calcitriol are intestine and bone. A calcitriol receptor-binding protein appears to exist in the mucosa of human intestine. Additional evidence suggests that calcitriol may also act on the kidney and the parathyroid glands. Calcitriol is the most active known form of vitamin D3 in stimulating intestinal calcium transport. In acutely uremic rats calcitriol has been shown to stimulate intestinal calcium absorption.\n\n【35】 ## Pharmacokinetics\nAbsorption\n- Calcitriol is rapidly absorbed from the intestine. Peak serum concentrations (above basal values) were reached within 3 to 6 hours following oral administration of single doses of 0.25 to 1.0 mcg of calcitriol. Following a single oral dose of 0.5 mcg, mean serum concentrations of calcitriol rose from a baseline value of 40.0 ± 4.4 (SD) pg/mL to 60.0 ± 4.4 pg/mL at 2 hours, and declined to 53.0 ± 6.9 at 4 hours, 50 ± 7.0 at 8 hours, 44 ± 4.6 at 12 hours, and 41.5 ± 5.1 at 24 hours.\n- Following multiple-dose administration, serum calcitriol levels reached steady-state within 7 days.\nDistribution\nMetabolism\n- In vivo and in vitro studies indicate the presence of two pathways of metabolism for calcitriol. The first pathway involves the 24-hydroxylase as the first step in catabolism of calcitriol. There is definite evidence of 24-hydroxylase activity in the kidney; this enzyme is also present in many target tissues which possess the vitamin D receptor such as the intestine. The end product of this pathway is a side chain shortened metabolite, calcitroic acid. The second pathway involves the conversion of calcitriol via the stepwise hydroxylation of carbon-26 and carbon-23, and cyclization to yield ultimately 1α, 25R(OH)‑2-26, 23S-lactone D3. The lactone appears to be the major metabolite circulating in humans, with mean serum concentrations of 131 ± 17 pg/mL. In addition, several other metabolites of calcitriol have been identified: 1α, 25(OH)2-24-oxo-D3; 1α, 23,25(OH)3-24-oxo-D3; 1‑α, 24R,25(OH)3D3; 1α, 25S,26(OH)3D3; 1α, 25(OH)2-23-oxo-D3; 1α, 25R,26(OH)3-23-oxo-D3; 1α, (OH)24,25,26,27-tetranor-COOH-D3.\nExcretion\n- Enterohepatic recycling and biliary excretion of calcitriol occur. The metabolites of calcitriol are excreted primarily in feces. Following intravenous administration of radiolabeled calcitriol in normal subjects, approximately 27% and 7% of the radioactivity appeared in the feces and urine, respectively, within 24 hours. When a 1 mcg oral dose of radiolabeled calcitriol was administered to normal subjects, approximately 10% of the total radioactivity appeared in urine within 24 hours. Cumulative excretion of radioactivity on the sixth day following intravenous administration of radiolabeled calcitriol averaged 16% in urine and 49% in feces. The elimination half-life of calcitriol in serum after single oral doses is about 5 to 8 hours in normal subjects.\nSpecial Populations\n- Pediatric Pharmacokinetics\n- The steady-state pharmacokinetics of oral calcitriol were determined in a small group of pediatric patients (age range: 1.8 to 16 years) undergoing peritoneal dialysis. Calcitriol was administered for 2 months at an average dose of 10.2 ng/kg (SD 5.5 ng/kg). In this pediatric population, mean Cmax was 116 pmol/L, mean serum half-life was 27.4 hours, and mean clearance was 15.3 mL/hr/kg.1\n- Geriatric:\n- No studies have examined the pharmacokinetics of calcitriol in geriatric patients.\n- Controlled studies examining the influence of gender on calcitriol have not been conducted.\n- Hepatic Insufficiency:\n- Lower predose and peak calcitriol levels in serum were observed in patients with nephrotic syndrome and in patients undergoing hemodialysis compared with healthy subjects. The elimination half-life of calcitriol increased by at least two-fold in chronic renal failure and hemodialysis patients compared with healthy subjects. Peak serum levels in patients with nephrotic syndrome were reached in 4 hours. For patients requiring hemodialysis peak serum levels were reached in 8 to 12 hours; half-lives were estimated to be 16.2 and 21.9 hours, respectively.\n\n【36】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\n- Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\n- Long-term studies in animals have not been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of calcitriol. Calcitriol is not mutagenic in vitro in the Ames Test, nor is it genotoxic in vivo in the Mouse Micronucleus Test. No significant effects of calcitriol on fertility and/or general reproductive performances were observed in a Segment I study in rats at doses of up to 0.3 mcg/kg (approximately 3 times the maximum recommended dose based on body surface area).\n\n【37】 #Clinical Studies\nThere is limited information regarding Clinical Studies of Calcitriol (oral) in the drug label.\n\n【38】 #How Supplied\n- Calcitriol capsules are available as follows:\n- 0.25 mcg - opaque, red-brown and yellow-brown, two-tone, oval, soft, gelatin capsules, imprinted “93” and “657”, in bottles of 100.\n\n【39】 ## Storage\n- Store at 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F) . Protect from light.\n- Dispense in a tight, light-resistant container as defined in the USP, with a child-resistant closure (as required).\n\n【40】 #Patient Counseling Information\n- The patient and his or her caregivers should be informed about compliance with dosage instructions, adherence to instructions about diet and calcium supplementation, and avoidance of the use of unapproved nonprescription drugs.

Rashes were usually maculopapular and of mild or moderate intensity, some with pruritus. Rash had a median onset of 11 days after initiation of LEXIVA and had a median duration of 13 days. Skin rash led to discontinuation of LEXIVA in less than 1% of subjects. In some subjects with mild or moderate rash, dosing with LEXIVA was often continued without interruption; if interrupted, reintroduction of LEXIVA generally did not result in rash recurrence.\nThe percentages of subjects with Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities in the clinical efficacy trials of LEXIVA are presented in Tables 5 and 6.\nLEXIVA with and without ritonavir was studied in 237 HIV-1–infected pediatric subjects aged at least 4 weeks to 18 years in 3 open‑label trials, APV20002, APV20003, and APV29005 .

To avoid precipitating an opioid withdrawal syndrome, the first dose of buprenorphine/naloxone should be started only when objective signs of moderate withdrawal appear.\nOn Day 1, an induction dosage of up to 8 mg /2 mg buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual film is recommended. Clinicians should start with an initial dose of 2 mg/ 0.5 mg or 4 mg/1 mg buprenorphine/naloxone and may titrate upwards in 2 or 4 mg increments of buprenorphine, at approximately 2-hour intervals, under supervision, to 8 mg/2 mg buprenorphine/naloxone based on the control of acute withdrawal symptoms.\nOn Day 2, a single daily dose of up to 16 mg/4 mg buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual film is recommended.\nMedication should be prescribed in consideration of the frequency of visits. Provision of multiple refills is not advised early in treatment or without appropriate patient follow-up visits.\nPatients dependent upon methadone or long-acting opioid products may be more susceptible to precipitated and prolonged withdrawal during induction than those on short-acting opioid products. Buprenorphine/naloxone combination products have not been evaluated in adequate and well-controlled studies for induction in patients on long-acting opioid products, and contain naloxone, which is absorbed in small amounts by the sublingual route and could cause worse precipitated and prolonged withdrawal. For this reason, buprenorphine monotherapy is recommended in patients taking long-acting opioids when used according to approved administration instructions. Following induction, the patient may then be transitioned to once-daily buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual film.\nPatients dependent on heroin or short-acting opioid products may be inducted with either buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual film or with sublingual buprenorphine monotherapy. The first dose of buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual film or buprenorphine should be administered when objective signs of moderate opioid withdrawal appear, and not less than 6 hours after the patient last used an opioid.\nIt is recommended that an adequate maintenance dose, titrated to clinical effectiveness, be achieved as rapidly as possible. In some studies, a too-gradual induction over several days led to a high rate of drop-out of buprenorphine patients during the induction period.\nThe dosage of buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual film from Day 3 onwards should be progressively adjusted in increments/decrements of 2 mg/0.5 mg or 4 mg/1 mg buprenorphine/naloxone to a level that holds the patient in treatment and suppresses opioid withdrawal signs and symptoms.\nAfter treatment induction and stabilization, the maintenance dose of buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual film is generally in the range of 4 mg/1 mg buprenorphine/naloxone to 24 mg/6 mg buprenorphine/naloxone per day depending on the individual patient and clinical response. The recommended target dosage of buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual film during maintenance is 16 mg/4 mg buprenorphine/naloxone/day as a single daily dose. Dosages higher than 24 mg/6 mg daily have not been demonstrated to provide a clinical advantage.\nDo not cut, chew, or swallow buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual film. Place the buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual film under the tongue, close to the base on the left or right side. If an additional sublingual film is necessary to achieve the prescribed dose, place the additional sublingual film sublingually on the opposite side from the first film. Place the sublingual film in a manner to minimize overlapping as much as possible. The sublingual film must be kept under the tongue until the film is completely dissolved. Buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual film should NOT be moved after placement. Proper administration technique should be demonstrated to the patient.\nTreatment should be initiated with supervised administration, progressing to unsupervised administration as the patient's clinical stability permits.  buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual film is subject to diversion and abuse.  When determining the prescription quantity for unsupervised administration, consider the patient's level of stability, the security of his or her home situation, and other factors likely to affect the ability to manage supplies of take-home medication.\nIdeally patients should be seen at reasonable intervals (e.g. at least weekly during the first month of treatment) based upon the individual circumstances of the patient. Medication should be prescribed in consideration of the frequency of visits.  Provision of multiple refills is not advised early in treatment or without appropriate patient follow-up visits.  Periodic assessment is necessary to determine compliance with the dosing regimen, effectiveness of the treatment plan, and overall patient progress.\nOnce a stable dosage has been achieved and patient assessment (e.g. urine drug screening) does not indicate illicit drug use, less frequent follow-up visits may be appropriate. A once-monthly visit schedule may be reasonable for patients on a stable dosage of medication who are making progress toward their treatment objectives. Continuation or modification of pharmacotherapy should be based on the physician's evaluation of treatment outcomes and objectives such as:\n- Absence of medication toxicity.\n- Responsible handling of medications by the patient.\n- Patient's compliance with all elements of the treatment plan (including recovery-oriented activities, psychotherapy, and/or other psychosocial modalities).\n- Abstinence from illicit drug use (including problematic alcohol and/or benzodiazepine use).\nIf treatment goals are not being achieved, the physician should re-evaluate the appropriateness of continuing the current treatment.\nBecause the doses of this fixed combination product cannot be individually titrated, severe hepatic impairment results in a reduced clearance of naloxone to a much greater extent than buprenorphine, and moderate hepatic impairment also results in a reduced clearance of naloxone to a greater extent than buprenorphine, the combination product should generally be avoided in patients with severe hepatic impairment and may not be appropriate for patients with moderate hepatic impairment.\nPhysicians will need to decide when they cannot appropriately provide further management for particular patients. For example, some patients may be abusing or dependent on various drugs, or unresponsive to psychosocial intervention such that the physician does not feel that he/she has the expertise to manage the patient. In such cases, the physician may want to assess whether to refer the patient to a specialist or more intensive behavioral treatment environment. Decisions should be based on a treatment plan established and agreed upon with the patient at the beginning of treatment.\nPatients who continue to misuse, abuse, or divert buprenorphine products or other opioids should be provided with, or referred to, more intensive and structured treatment.\n2 mg/0.5 mg, 4 mg/1 mg, 8 mg/2 mg and the 12 mg/3 mg units, are different from one another. If patients switch between various combinations of lower and higher strength units of buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual films to obtain the same total dose, (e.g. from three 4 mg/1 mg units to a single 12 mg/3 mg unit, or vice-versa), systemic exposures of buprenorphine/naloxone may be different and patients should be monitored for over-dosing or under-dosing. For this reason, pharmacist should not substitute one or more film strengths for another without approval of the prescriber.\n\n【3】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Buprenorphine Hydrochloride, Naloxone Hydrochloride in adult patients.\n\n【4】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Buprenorphine Hydrochloride, Naloxone Hydrochloride in adult patients.\n\n【5】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Pediatric)\nThere is limited information regarding Buprenorphine Hydrochloride, Naloxone Hydrochloride FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Pediatric) in the drug label.\n\n【6】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Buprenorphine Hydrochloride, Naloxone Hydrochloride in pediatric patients.\n\n【7】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Buprenorphine Hydrochloride, Naloxone Hydrochloride in pediatric patients.\n\n【8】 #Contraindications\nBuprenorphine/naloxone sublingual film should not be administered to patients who have been shown to be hypersensitive to buprenorphine or naloxone as serious adverse reactions, including anaphylactic shock, have been reported.\n\n【9】 Buprenorphine can be abused in a manner similar to other opioids, legal or illicit. Prescribe and dispense buprenorphine with appropriate precautions to minimize risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion, and ensure appropriate protection from theft, including in the home. Clinical monitoring appropriate to the patient's level of stability is essential. Multiple refills should not be prescribed early in treatment or without appropriate patient follow-up visits.\nIn the case of overdose, the primary management should be the re-establishment of adequate ventilation with mechanical assistance of respiration, if required. Naloxone may be of value for the management of buprenorphine overdose. Higher than normal doses and repeated administration may be necessary.\nBuprenorphine/naloxone sublingual film should be used with caution in patients with compromised respiratory function (e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cor pulmonale, decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression).\nPatients receiving buprenorphine in the presence of opioid analgesics, general anesthetics, benzodiazepines, phenothiazines, other tranquilizers, sedative/hypnotics, or other CNS depressants (including alcohol) may exhibit increased CNS depression. Consider dose reduction of CNS depressants, buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual film, or both in situations of concomitant prescription.\nCases of cytolytic hepatitis and hepatitis with jaundice have been observed in individuals receiving buprenorphine in clinical trials and through post-marketing adverse event reports. The spectrum of abnormalities ranges from transient asymptomatic elevations in hepatic transaminases to case reports of death, hepatic failure, hepatic necrosis, hepatorenal syndrome, and hepatic encephalopathy. In many cases, the presence of pre-existing liver enzyme abnormalities, infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus, concomitant usage of other potentially hepatotoxic drugs, and ongoing injecting drug use may have played a causative or contributory role. In other cases, insufficient data were available to determine the etiology of the abnormality. Withdrawal of buprenorphine has resulted in amelioration of acute hepatitis in some cases; however, in other cases no dose reduction was necessary. The possibility exists that buprenorphine had a causative or contributory role in the development of the hepatic abnormality in some cases. Liver function tests, prior to initiation of treatment are recommended to establish a baseline. Periodic monitoring of liver function during treatment is also recommended. A biological and etiological evaluation is recommended when a hepatic event is suspected. Depending on the case, buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual film may need to be carefully discontinued to prevent withdrawal signs and symptoms and a return by the patient to illicit drug use, and strict monitoring of the patient should be initiated.\nCases of hypersensitivity to buprenorphine/naloxone containing products have been reported both in clinical trials and in the post-marketing experience. Cases of bronchospasm, angioneurotic edema, and anaphylactic shock have been reported. The most common signs and symptoms include rashes, hives, and pruritus. A history of hypersensitivity to buprenorphine or naloxone is a contraindication to the use of buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual film.\nBecause it contains naloxone, buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual film is likely to produce withdrawal signs and symptoms if misused parenterally by individuals dependent on full opioid agonists such as heroin, morphine, or methadone. Because of the partial agonist properties of buprenorphine, buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual film may precipitate opioid withdrawal signs and symptoms in such persons if administered sublingually before the agonist effects of the opioid have subsided.\nNeonatal withdrawal has been reported in the infants of women treated with buprenorphine during pregnancy. From post-marketing reports, the time to onset of neonatal withdrawal signs ranged from Day 1 to Day 8 of life with most cases occurring on Day 1. Adverse events associated with the neonatal withdrawal syndrome included hypertonia, neonatal tremor, neonatal agitation, and myoclonus, and there have been reports of convulsions, apnea, respiratory depression, and bradycardia.\nThere have been reported deaths of opioid naive individuals who received a 2 mg dose of buprenorphine as a sublingual tablet for analgesia. Buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual film is not appropriate as an analgesic.\nbuprenorphine/naloxone products are not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment and may not be appropriate for patients with moderate hepatic impairment. Because hepatic impairment results in a reduced clearance of naloxone to a much greater extent than buprenorphine, the doses of buprenorphine and naloxone in this fixed-dose combination product cannot be individually titrated. Therefore, patients with severe hepatic impairment will be exposed to substantially higher levels of naloxone than patients with normal hepatic function. This may result in an increased risk of precipitated withdrawal at the beginning of treatment (induction) and may interfere with buprenorphine's efficacy throughout treatment. In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, the differential reduction of naloxone clearance compared to buprenorphine clearance is not as great as in subjects with severe hepatic impairment. Therefore, buprenorphine/naloxone products are not recommended for initiation of treatment (induction) in patients with moderate hepatic impairment due to the increased risk of precipitated withdrawal. However, buprenorphine/naloxone products may be used with caution for maintenance treatment in patients with moderate hepatic impairment who have initiated treatment on a buprenorphine product without naloxone. However, patients should be carefully monitored and consideration given to the possibility of naloxone interfering with buprenorphine's efficacy.\nLike other opioids, buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual film may produce orthostatic hypotension in ambulatory patients.\nAs with other opioids, buprenorphine may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course of patients with acute abdominal conditions.\n\n【10】 #Drug Abuse and Dependence\nBuprenorphine is a Schedule III narcotic under the Controlled Substances Act.\nUnder the Drug Addiction Treatment Act (DATA) codified at 21 U.S.C. 823(g), prescription use of this product in the treatment of opioid dependence is limited to physicians who meet certain qualifying requirements, and who have notified the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) of their intent to prescribe this product for the treatment of opioid dependence and have been assigned a unique identification number that must be included on every prescription.\nBuprenorphine, like morphine and other opioids, has the potential for being abused and is subject to criminal diversion. This should be considered when prescribing or dispensing buprenorphine in situations when the clinician is concerned about an increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion. Healthcare professionals should contact their state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product.\nPatients who continue to misuse, abuse, or divert buprenorphine products or other opioids should be provided with or referred for more intensive and structured treatment.\nAbuse of buprenorphine poses a risk of overdose and death. This risk is increased with the abuse of buprenorphine and alcohol and other substances, especially benzodiazepines.\nThe physician may be able to more easily detect misuse or diversion by maintaining records of medication prescribed including date, dose, quantity, frequency of refills, and renewal requests of medication prescribed.\nProper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic re-evaluation of therapy, and proper handling and storage of the medication are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs.\nA neonatal withdrawal syndrome has been reported in the infants of women treated with buprenorphine during pregnancy\n\n【11】 ## Clinical Trials Experience\nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.\nThe safety of buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual film is supported by clinical trials using buprenorphine sublingual tablets and buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual tablets, and other trials using buprenorphine sublingual solutions, as well as an open-label study in 194 patients treated with buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual film. In total, safety data from clinical studies are available from over 3000 opioid-dependent subjects exposed to buprenorphine at doses in the range used in the treatment of opioid dependence. Few differences in the adverse event profile were noted among buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual film, buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual tablets, buprenorphine sublingual tablets and a buprenorphine ethanolic sublingual solution.\nThe most common adverse event (>1%) associated with the sublingual administration of the buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual film was oral hypoesthesia. Other adverse events were constipation, glossodynia, oral mucosal erythema, vomiting, intoxication, disturbance in attention, palpitations, insomnia, withdrawal syndrome, hyperhidrosis, and blurred vision.\nOther adverse event data were derived from larger, controlled studies of buprenorphine/naloxone and buprenorphine tablets and of buprenorphine sublingual solution. In a comparative study of buprenorphine/naloxone and buprenorphine sublingual tablets, adverse event profiles were similar for subjects treated with 16 mg/4 mg buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual tablets or 16 mg buprenorphine sublingual tablets. The following adverse events were reported to occur by at least 5% of patients in a 4 week study of buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual tablets and buprenorphine sublingual tablets.\nFour subjects left the study early on the first day of sublingual film administration. However, there was not evidence to suggest that any of the four subjects experienced precipitated withdrawal secondary to the administration of buprenorphine or buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual films.\n\n【12】 ## Postmarketing Experience\nThe most frequently reported postmarketing adverse events were peripheral edema, stomatitis, glossitis, and tongue disorder.\n\n【13】 #Drug Interactions\nBuprenorphine is metabolized to norbuprenorphine primarily by cytochrome CYP3A4; therefore, potential interactions may occur when buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual film is given concurrently with agents that affect CYP3A4 activity. The concomitant use of buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual film with CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. azole antifungals such as ketoconazole, macrolide antibiotics such as erythromycin, and HIV protease inhibitors) should be monitored and may require dose-reduction of one or both agents.\nThe interaction of buprenorphine with CYP3A4 inducers has not been studied; therefore, it is recommended that patients receiving buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual film be monitored for signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal if inducers of CYP3A4 (e.g. efavirenz, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampicin) are co-administered.\nThree classes of antiretroviral agents have been evaluated for CYP3A4 interactions with buprenorphine. Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) do not appear to induce or inhibit the P450 enzyme pathway, thus no interactions with buprenorphine are expected. Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) are metabolized principally by CYP3A4. Efavirenz, nevirapine and etravirine are known CYP3A inducers whereas delaviridine is a CYP3A inhibitor. Significant pharmacokinetic interactions between NNRTIs (e.g. efavirenz and delavirdine) and buprenorphine have been shown in clinical studies, but these pharmacokinetic interactions did not result in any significant pharmacodynamic effects. It is recommended that patients who are on chronic buprenorphine treatment have their dose monitored if NNRTIs are added to their treatment regimen. Studies have shown some antiretroviral protease inhibitors (PIs) with CYP3A4 inhibitory activity (nelfinavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, ritonavir) have little effect on buprenorphine pharmacokinetic and no significant pharmacodynamic effects. Other PIs with CYP3A4 inhibitory activity (atazanavir and atazanavir/ritonavir) resulted in elevated levels of buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine and patients in one study reported increased sedation. Symptoms of opioid excess have been found in post-marketing reports of patients receiving buprenorphine and atazanavir with and without ritonavir concomitantly. Monitoring of patients taking buprenorphine and atazanavir with and without ritonavir is recommended, and dose reduction of buprenorphine may be warranted.\nThere have been a number of post-marketing reports regarding coma and death associated with the concomitant use of buprenorphine and benzodiazepines. In many, but not all, of these cases, buprenorphine was misused by self-injection. Preclinical studies have shown that the combination of benzodiazepines and buprenorphine altered the usual ceiling effect on buprenorphine-induced respiratory depression, making the respiratory effects of buprenorphine appear similar to those of full opioid agonists. Buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual film should be prescribed with caution to patients taking benzodiazepines or other drugs that act on the CNS, regardless of whether these drugs are taken on the advice of a physician or are being abused/misused. Patients should be warned that it is extremely dangerous to self-administer non-prescribed benzodiazepines while taking buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual film, and should also be cautioned to use benzodiazepines concurrently with buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual film only as directed by their physician.\n\n【14】 ### Pregnancy\nPregnancy Category (FDA): C\nThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies of buprenorphine/naloxone in pregnant women. Limited published data on use of buprenorphine, the active ingredient in buprenorphine/naloxone, in pregnancy, have not shown an increased risk of major malformations. All pregnancies, regardless of drug exposure, have a background risk of 2-4% for major birth defects, and 15-20% for pregnancy loss. Reproductive and developmental studies in rats and rabbits identified adverse events at clinically relevant doses. Pre-and postnatal development studies in rats demonstrated dystocia, increased neonatal deaths, and developmental delays. No clear teratogenic effects were seen with a range of doses equivalent to or greater than the human dose. However, in a few studies, some events such as acephalus, omphalocele, and skeletal abnormalities were observed but these findings were not clearly treatment-related. Embryofetal death was also observed in both rats and rabbits.\nBuprenorphine/naloxone sublingual film should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\nOpioid dependence in pregnancy is associated with adverse obstetrical outcomes such as low birth weight, preterm birth, and fetal death.\nNeonatal abstinence syndrome may occur in newborn infants of mothers who were on buprenorphine maintenance treatment. Observe newborns for poor feeding, diarrhea, irritability, tremor, rigidity, and seizures, and manage accordingly.\nStudies have been conducted to evaluate neonatal outcomes in women exposed to buprenorphine during pregnancy. Limited published data on malformations from trials, observational studies, case series, and case reports on buprenorphine use in pregnancy have not shown an increased risk of major malformations. Based on these studies the incidence of neonatal abstinence syndrome is not clear and there does not appear to be a dose-response relationship.\nEffects on embryo-fetal development were studied in Sprague-Dawley rats and Russian white rabbits following oral (1:1) and intramuscular (IM) (3:2) administration of mixtures of buprenorphine and naloxone. Following oral administration to rats and rabbits, no teratogenic effects were observed at buprenorphine doses up to 250 mg/kg/day and 40 mg/kg/day, respectively (estimated exposure approximately 150 times and 50 times, respectively, the recommended human daily sublingual dose of 16 mg on a mg/m2 basis). No definitive drug-related teratogenic effects were observed in rats and rabbits at IM doses up to 30 mg/kg/day (estimated exposure approximately 20 times and 35 times, respectively, the recommended human daily dose of 16 mg on a mg/m2 basis). Acephalus was observed in one rabbit fetus from the low-dose group and omphalocele was observed in two rabbit fetuses from the same litter in the mid-dose group; no findings were observed in fetuses from the high-dose group. Following oral administration of buprenorphine to rats, dose-related post-implantation losses, evidenced by increases in the numbers of early resorptions with consequent reductions in the numbers of fetuses, were observed at doses of 10 mg/kg/day or greater (estimated exposure approximately 6 times the recommended human daily sublingual dose of 16 mg on a mg/m2 basis). In the rabbit, increased post-implantation losses occurred at an oral dose of 40 mg/kg/day. Following IM administration in the rat and the rabbit, post-implantation losses, as evidenced by decreases in live fetuses and increases in resorptions, occurred at 30 mg/kg/day.\nBuprenorphine was not teratogenic in rats or rabbits after IM or subcutaneous (SC) doses up to 5 mg/kg/day (estimated exposure was approximately 3 and 6 times, respectively, the recommended human daily sublingual dose of 16 mg on a mg/m2 basis), after IV doses up to 0.8 mg/kg/day (estimated exposure was approximately 0.5 times and equal to, respectively, the recommended human daily sublingual dose of 16 mg on a mg/m2 basis), or after oral doses up to 160 mg/kg/day in rats (estimated exposure was approximately 95 times the recommended human daily sublingual dose of 16 mg on a mg/m2 basis) and 25 mg/kg/day in rabbits (estimated exposure was approximately 30 times the recommended human daily sublingual dose of 16 mg on a mg/m2 basis). Significant increases in skeletal abnormalities (e.g. extra thoracic vertebra or thoraco-lumbar ribs) were noted in rats after SC administration of 1 mg/kg/day and up (estimated exposure was approximately 0.6 times the recommended human daily sublingual dose of 16 mg on a mg/m2 basis), but were not observed at oral doses up to 160 mg/kg/day. Increases in skeletal abnormalities in rabbits after IM administration of 5 mg/kg/day (estimated exposure was approximately 6 times the recommended human daily sublingual dose of 16 mg on a mg/m2 basis) or oral administration of 1 mg/kg/day or greater (estimated exposure was approximately equal to the recommended human daily sublingual dose of 16 mg on a mg/m2 basis) were not statistically significant.\nIn rabbits, buprenorphine produced statistically significant pre-implantation losses at oral doses of 1 mg/kg/day or greater and post-implantation losses that were statistically significant at IV doses of 0.2 mg/kg/day or greater (estimated exposure approximately 0.3 times the recommended human daily sublingual dose of 16 mg on a mg/m2 basis).\nDystocia was noted in pregnant rats treated intramuscularly with buprenorphine 5 mg/kg/day (approximately 3 times the recommended human daily sublingual dose of 16 mg on a mg/m2 basis). Fertility, peri-, and post-natal development studies with buprenorphine in rats indicated increases in neonatal mortality after oral doses of 0.8 mg/kg/day and up (approximately 0.5 times the recommended human daily sublingual dose of 16 mg on a mg/m2 basis), after IM doses of 0.5 mg/kg/day and up (approximately 0.3 times the recommended human daily sublingual dose of 16 mg on a mg/m2 basis), and after SC doses of 0.1 mg/kg/day and up (approximately 0.06 times the recommended human daily sublingual dose of 16 mg on a mg/m2 basis). An apparent lack of milk production during these studies likely contributed to the decreased pup viability and lactation indices. Delays in the occurrence of righting reflex and startle response were noted in rat pups at an oral dose of 80 mg/kg/day (approximately 50 times the recommended human daily sublingual dose of 16 mg on a mg/m2 basis).\nThere is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Buprenorphine Hydrochloride, Naloxone Hydrochloride in women who are pregnant.\n\n【15】 ### Labor and Delivery\nAs with all opioids, use of buprenorphine prior to delivery may result in respiratory depression in the newborn. Closely monitor neonates for signs of respiratory depression. An opioid antagonist such as naloxone should be available for reversal of opioid induced respiratory depression in the neonate.\n\n【16】 ### Nursing Mothers\nBased on two studies in 13 lactating women, buprenorphine and its metabolite norbuprenorphine are present in low levels in human milk and infant urine, and available data have not shown adverse reactions in breastfed infants. There are no data on the combination product buprenorphine/naloxone in breastfeeding, however oral absorption of naloxone is minimal. Caution should be exercised when buprenorphine/naloxone is administered to a nursing woman. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for buprenorphine/naloxone and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from the drug or from the underlying maternal condition.\nAdvise the nursing mother taking buprenorphine/naloxone to monitor the infant for increased drowsiness and breathing difficulties.\nBased on limited data from a study of 6 lactating women who were taking a median oral dose of buprenorphine of 0.29 mg/kg/day 5-8 days after delivery, breast milk contained a median infant dose of 0.42 mcg/kg/day of buprenorphine and 0.33 mcg/kg/day of norbuprenorphine, which are equal to 0.2% and 0.12% of the maternal weight-adjusted dose.\nNo adverse reactions were observed in the infants in these two studies.\n\n【17】 ### Pediatric Use\nThe safety and effectiveness of buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual film have not been established in pediatric patients. This product is not appropriate for the treatment of neonatal abstinence syndrome in neonates, because it contains naloxone, an opioid antagonist.\n\n【18】 ### Geriatic Use\nClinical studies of buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual film, buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual tablets, or buprenorphine sublingual tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they responded differently than younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.\n\n【19】 ### Gender\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Buprenorphine Hydrochloride, Naloxone Hydrochloride with respect to specific gender populations.\n\n【20】 ### Race\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Buprenorphine Hydrochloride, Naloxone Hydrochloride with respect to specific racial populations.\n\n【21】 ### Renal Impairment\nNo differences in buprenorphine pharmacokinetics were observed between 9 dialysis-dependent and 6 normal patients following IV administration of 0.3 mg buprenorphine. The effects of renal failure on naloxone pharmacokinetics are unknown.\n\n【22】 ### Hepatic Impairment\nThe effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of buprenorphine and naloxone has been evaluated in a pharmacokinetic study. Both drugs are extensively metabolized in the liver. While no clinically significant changes have been observed in subjects with mild hepatic impairment; the plasma levels have been shown to be higher and half-life values have been shown to be longer for both buprenorphine and naloxone in subjects with moderate and severe hepatic impairment. The magnitude of the effects on naloxone are greater than that on buprenorphine in both moderately and severely impaired subjects. The difference in magnitude of the effects on naloxone and buprenorphine are greater in subjects with severe hepatic impairment than in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment, and therefore the clinical impact of these effects is likely to be greater in patients with severe hepatic impairment than in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. Buprenorphine/naloxone products should be avoided in patients with severe hepatic impairment and may not be appropriate for patients with moderate hepatic impairment\n\n【23】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Buprenorphine Hydrochloride, Naloxone Hydrochloride in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n\n【24】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\nThere is no FDA guidance one the use of Buprenorphine Hydrochloride, Naloxone Hydrochloride in patients who are immunocompromised.\n\n【25】 ### Administration\nOral\n\n【26】 ### Monitoring\nPatients should be monitored for symptoms related to over-dosing or under-dosing when switching between buprenorphine or buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets and buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual film and between buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual film strengths.\n\n【27】 #IV Compatibility\nThere is limited information regarding the compatibility of Buprenorphine Hydrochloride, Naloxone Hydrochloride and IV administrations.\n\n【28】 #Overdosage\nThe manifestations of acute overdose include pinpoint pupils, sedation, hypotension, respiratory depression, and death.\nIn the event of overdose, the respiratory and cardiac status of the patient should be monitored carefully. When respiratory or cardiac functions are depressed, primary attention should be given to the re-establishment of adequate respiratory exchange through provision of a patent airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation. Oxygen, IV fluids, vasopressors, and other supportive measures should be employed as indicated.\n\n【29】 ## Mechanism of Action\nBuprenorphine is a partial agonist at the mu-opioid receptor and an antagonist at the kappa-opioid receptor. Naloxone is a potent antagonist at mu-opioid receptors and produces opioid withdrawal signs and symptoms in individuals physically dependent on full opioid agonists when administered parenterally.\n\n【30】 ## Structure\nBuprenorphine/naloxone sublingual film is an orange film, imprinted with a logo identifying the product and strength in white ink. It contains buprenorphine HCl, a mu-opioid receptor partial agonist and a kappa-opioid receptor antagonist, and naloxone HCl dihydrate, an opioid receptor antagonist, at a ratio of 4:1 (ratio of free bases). It is intended for sublingual administration and is available in four dosage strengths, 2 mg buprenorphine with 0.5 mg naloxone, 4 mg buprenorphine with 1 mg naloxone, 8 mg buprenorphine with 2 mg naloxone and 12 mg buprenorphine with 3 mg naloxone.\nChemically, buprenorphine HCl is (2S)-2--3,3-dimethylbutan-2-ol hydrochloride. It has the following chemical structure:\nBuprenorphine HCl has the molecular formula C29 H41 NO4 - HCl and the molecular weight is 504.10. It is a white or off-white crystalline powder, sparingly soluble in water, freely soluble in methanol, soluble in alcohol, and practically insoluble in cyclohexane.\nNaloxone hydrochloride dihydrate has the molecular formula C19H21NO4 - HCl - 2H2O and the molecular weight is 399.87. It is a white to slightly off-white powder and is freely soluble in water, soluble in alcohol, and practically insoluble in toluene and ether.\n\n【31】 ## Pharmacodynamics\nComparisons of buprenorphine to full opioid agonists such as methadone and hydromorphone suggest that sublingual buprenorphine produces typical opioid agonist effects which are limited by a ceiling effect.\nIn opioid-experienced subjects who were not physically dependent, acute sublingual doses of buprenorphine/naloxone tablets produced opioid agonist effects which reached a maximum between doses of 8 mg/2 mg and 16 mg/4 mg buprenorphine/naloxone.\nOpioid agonist ceiling-effects were also observed in a double-blind, parallel group, dose-ranging comparison of single doses of buprenorphine sublingual solution  longer than for the lower doses and did not return to baseline until 48 hours after drug administration. The onset of effects appeared more rapidly with buprenorphine than with the full agonist control, with most doses nearing peak effect after 100 minutes for buprenorphine compared to 150 minutes for the full agonist control.\nBuprenorphine in IV . Minimum and maximum effects were similar across all treatments. Subjects remained responsive to low voice and responded to computer prompts. Some subjects showed irritability, but no other changes were observed.\nThe respiratory effects of sublingual buprenorphine were compared with the effects of methadone in a double-blind, parallel group, dose ranging comparison of single doses of buprenorphine sublingual solution  in non-dependent, opioid-experienced volunteers. In this study, hypoventilation not requiring medical intervention was reported more frequently after buprenorphine doses of 4 mg and higher than after methadone. Both drugs decreased O2 saturation to the same degree.\nPhysiologic and subjective effects following acute sublingual administration of buprenorphine tablets and buprenorphine/naloxone tablets were similar at equivalent dose levels of buprenorphine However, clinicians should be aware that some opioid-dependent persons, particularly those with a low level of full mu-opioid physical dependence or those whose opioid physical dependence is predominantly to buprenorphine, abuse buprenorphine/naloxone combinations by the intravenous or intranasal route. In methadone-maintained patients and heroin-dependent subjects, IV administration of buprenorphine/naloxone combinations precipitated opioid withdrawal signs and symptoms and was perceived as unpleasant and dysphoric. In morphine-stabilized subjects, intravenously administered combinations of buprenorphine with naloxone produced opioid antagonist and withdrawal signs and symptoms that were ratio-dependent; the most intense withdrawal signs and symptoms were produced by 2:1 and 4:1 ratios, less intense by an 8:1 ratio.\n\n【32】 ## Pharmacokinetics\nIn pharmacokinetic studies, the 2 mg/0.5 mg and 4 mg/1 mg doses administered as buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual films showed comparable relative bioavailability to the same total dose of buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual tablets, whereas the 8 mg/2 mg and 12 mg/3 mg doses administered as buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual films showed higher relative bioavailability for both buprenorphine and naloxone compared to the same total dose of buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual tablets. A combination of one 8 mg/2 mg and two 2 mg/0.5 mg buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual films (total dose of 12 mg/ 3 mg) showed comparable relative bioavailability to the same total dose of buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual tablets.\nBuprenorphine is approximately 96% protein bound, primarily to alpha and beta globulin.\nNaloxone is approximately 45% protein bound, primarily to albumin.\nBuprenorphine undergoes both N-dealkylation to norbuprenorphine and glucuronidation. The N-dealkylation pathway is mediated primarily by the CYP3A4. Norbuprenorphine, the major metabolite, can further undergo glucuronidation. Norbuprenorphine has been found to bind opioid receptors in vitro; however, it has not been studied clinically for opioid-like activity. Naloxone undergoes direct glucuronidation to naloxone-3-glucuronide as well as N-dealkylation, and reduction of the 6-oxo group.\nA mass balance study of buprenorphine showed complete recovery of radiolabel in urine (30%) and feces (69%) collected up to 11 days after dosing. Almost all of the dose was accounted for in terms of buprenorphine, norbuprenorphine, and two unidentified buprenorphine metabolites. In urine, most of buprenorphineand norbuprenorphine was conjugated (buprenorphine, 1% free and 9.4% conjugated; norbuprenorphine, 2.7% free and 11% conjugated). In feces, almost all of the buprenorphineand norbuprenorphine were free (buprenorphine, 33% free and 5% conjugated; norbuprenorphine, 21% free and 2% conjugated). Based on all studies performed with buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual film, buprenorphinehas a mean elimination half-life from plasma ranging from 24 to 42 hours and naloxone has a mean elimination half-life from plasma ranging from 2 to 12 hours.\nCYP3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers: Subjects receiving buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual film should be monitored if inhibitors of CYP3A4 such as azole antifungal agents (e.g. ketoconazole), macrolide antibiotics (e.g. erythromycin) or HIV protease inhibitors and may require dose-reduction of one or both agents. The interaction of buprenorphine with all CYP3A4 inducers has not been studied, therefore it is recommended that patients receiving buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual film be monitored for signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal if inducers of CYP3A4 (e.g. phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampicin) are co-administered.\nHepatic Impairment: In a pharmacokinetic study, the disposition of buprenorphine and naloxone were determined after administering a buprenorphine/naloxone 2.0/0.5 mg sublingual tablet in subjects with varied degrees of hepatic impairment as indicated by Child-Pugh criteria. The disposition of buprenorphine and naloxone in patients with hepatic impairment were compared to disposition in subjects with normal hepatic function.\nIn subjects with mild hepatic impairment, the changes in mean Cmax, AUC0-last, and half-life values of both buprenorphine and naloxone were not clinically significant. No dosing adjustment is needed in patients with mild hepatic impairment.\nFor subjects with moderate and severe hepatic impairment, mean Cmax, AUC0-last, and half-life values of both buprenorphine and naloxone were increased; the effects on naloxone are greater than that on buprenorphine.\nThe difference in magnitude of the effects on naloxone and buprenorphine are greater in subjects with severe hepatic impairment than subjects with moderate hepatic impairment, and therefore the clinical impact of these effects is likely to be greater in patients with severe hepatic impairment than in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. Buprenorphine/naloxone products should be avoided in patients with severe hepatic impairment and may not be appropriate for patients with moderate hepatic impairment .\nHCV infection: In subjects with HCV infection but no sign of hepatic impairment, the changes in the mean Cmax, AUC0-last, and half-life values of buprenorphine and naloxone were not clinically significant in comparison to healthy subjects without HCV infection. No dosing adjustment is needed in patients with HCV infection.\n\n【33】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\nCarcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\nCarcinogenicity:\nA carcinogenicity study of buprenorphine/naloxone (4:1 ratio of the free bases) was performed in Alderley Park rats. Buprenorphine/naloxone was administered in the diet at doses of approximately 7, 31, and 123 mg/kg/day for 104 weeks (estimated exposure was approximately 4, 18, and 44 times the recommended human sublingual dose of 16 mg/4 mg buprenorphine/naloxone based on buprenorphine AUC comparisons). A statistically significant increase in Leydig cell adenomas was observed in all dose groups. No other drug-related tumors were noted.\nCarcinogenicity studies of buprenorphine were conducted in Sprague-Dawley rats and CD-1 mice. Buprenorphine was administered in the diet to rats at doses of 0.6, 5.5, and 56 mg/kg/day (estimated exposure was approximately 0.4, 3, and 35 times the recommended human daily sublingual dose of 16 mg on a mg/m2 basis) for 27 months. As in the buprenorphine/naloxone carcinogenicity study in rat, statistically significant dose-related increases in Leydig cell tumors occurred. In an 86-week study in CD-1 mice, buprenorphine was not carcinogenic at dietary doses up to 100 mg/kg/day (estimated exposure was approximately 30 times the recommended human daily sublingual dose of 16 mg on a mg/m2 basis).\nMutagenicity:\nThe 4:1 combination of buprenorphine and naloxone was not mutagenic in a bacterial mutation assay (Ames test) using four strains of S. typhimurium and two strains of E. coli. The combination was not clastogenic in an in vitro cytogenetic assay in human lymphocytes or in an IV micronucleus test in the rat.\nBuprenorphine was studied in a series of tests utilizing gene, chromosome, and DNA interactions in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems. Results were negative in yeast (S. cerevisiae) for recombinant, gene convertant, or forward mutations; negative in Bacillus subtilis “rec” assay, negative for clastogenicity in CHO cells, Chinese hamster bone marrow and spermatogonia cells, and negative in the mouse lymphoma L5178Y assay.\nResults were equivocal in the Ames test: negative in studies in two laboratories, but positive for frame shift mutation at a high dose (5mg/plate) in a third study. Results were positive in the Green-Tweets (E. coli) survival test, positive in a DNA synthesis inhibition (DSI) test with testicular tissue from mice, for both in vivo and in vitro incorporation of thymidine, and positive in unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) test using testicular cells from mice.\nImpairment of Fertility:\nDietary administration of buprenorphine in the rat at dose levels of 500 ppm or greater (equivalent to approximately 47 mg/kg/day or greater; estimated exposure approximately 28 times the recommended human daily sublingual dose of 16 mg on a mg/m2 basis) produced a reduction in fertility demonstrated by reduced female conception rates. A dietary dose of 100 ppm (equivalent to approximately 10 mg/kg/day; estimated exposure approximately 6 times the recommended human daily sublingual dose of 16 mg on a mg/m2 basis) had no adverse effect on fertility.\n\n【34】 #Clinical Studies\nThere is limited information regarding Buprenorphine Hydrochloride, Naloxone Hydrochloride Clinical Studies in the drug label.\n\n【35】 #How Supplied\nSUBOXONE sublingual film is supplied as an orange rectangular sublingual film with a white printed logo in child-resistant polyester/foil laminated pouches:\n5 mg/film; content expressed in terms of free base - 30 films per carton\n\n【36】 ## Storage\n- Store at 25°C (77°F), excursions permitted to 15-30°C (59-86°F)\n- Patients should be advised to store buprenorphine-containing medications safely and out of sight and reach of children.\n\n【37】 #Patient Counseling Information\nPatients should be advised NOT to cut, chew or swallow SUBOXONE sublingual film.\nBefore initiating treatment with SUBOXONE, explain the points listed below to caregivers and patients.

The theme, \"Second-Hand Smoke Kills-Let's Clear the Air,\" was designated by the World Health Organization (WHO) to raise awareness of the hazards of exposure to second-hand smoke. Tobacco use worldwide will cause an estimated 10 million deaths annually by 2030 . An effective strategy to promote and encourage tobacco-free policies is to link them with sporting events. Such policies also reduce nonsmokers' exposure to second-hand smoke . The 1988 Olympic Winter Games in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, was the first tobacco-free Olympics. Since then, all of the Olympic Games have had tobacco-free policies . For the 2002 games, the Olympic organizing committee for Salt Lake City, Utah, will implement a public information campaign using Olympic athletes to promote healthy lifestyles and sports as an alternative to tobacco use. Plans also include information to increase awareness of the tobacco-free policy among visitors, media, athletes, and officials from participating countries. Another media campaign is \"Tobacco Kills-Don't Be Duped,\" which aims to ban tobacco advertising and promotion at sporting events globally.\n- Persons aged >18 years who reported having smoked >100 cigarettes in their entire life and who reported smoking every day or some days.

Significant value: two-tailed p<0.05.\n\n【1】 #MMWR May 25, 2001\nTobacco Use Among Adults -Continued Asked about smoking and advised to stop smoking by a dentist? 9.9 (±4.5) 24.9 (±4.7)  - Persons aged >18 years who reported having smoked >100 cigarettes in their entire life and who reported smoking every day or some days.  Confidence interval.  Includes physicians, nurse practitioners, or physician assistants.  Significant value: two-tailed p<0.05. Asked of respondents who visited a dentist during the year preceding the survey. The decrease in smoking prevalence among low income and low education groups also indicates a narrowing in disparities in cigarette use.\nTEPP directed many of its activities toward Hispanics, which may, in part, explain the substantial decrease in cigarette smoking in that population. TEPP serves the Hispanic population through its Spanish language statewide media campaign and telephone helpline and through local cessation and prevention services. TEPP uses methods appropriate for this population, including Promotoras de Salud (lay health workers) and culturally appropriate materials and curricula.\nThe Arizona ATS results also showed a substantial increase in the proportion of smokers who reported that either a health-care provider or a dentist both asked about tobacco use and advised them to quit. Health-care providers can play a key role in assisting MMWR 405\nTobacco Use Among Adults -Continued patients to quit smoking , and brief physician advice substantially increases successful quitting . TEPP, through statewide and local projects, provides training for healthcare providers to increase the number of patients with whom they briefly discuss stopping smoking. The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, it is difficult to separate the effects of TEPP from price increases. The cigarette tax in Arizona increased from $0.18 to $0.58 per pack in November 1994, which may have contributed to the decline in adult smoking prevalence. Although the tax increase occurred more than a year before the first survey, the average retail price of cigarettes in Arizona continued to increase from $2.08 in 1996 to $2.50 in 1999 . Second, some segments of the population in Arizona, including some low income residents, are more likely than others to lack telephone service and therefore not be included in the study sample. Third, the response rate in 1999 was almost nine percentage points lower than the response rate in 1996, which may have influenced the results. Fourth, health-care provider communication data about smoking was based on self-reported recall for an entire year; the validity of these self-reports was not determined. Finally, although declines in smoking rates in Arizona may be a result of TEPP, a cause-and-effect relation cannot be established by comparing data from the cross-sectional ATS surveys alone. Comparing Arizona smoking prevalence trends and trends in other states with varying levels of interventions during 1996-1999 could help to determine how much of the decline may be related to the Arizona TEPP rather than to regional or national influences.\nArizona is one of seven states that meet CDC's funding recommendations for FY 2001  to reduce adult smoking rates to <12% will require similar programs to be implemented across the United States.\n\n【2】 #MMWR May 25, 2001\nTobacco Use Among Adults -Continued\n\n【3】 #Protracted Outbreaks of Cryptosporidiosis Associated With Swimming Pool Use -Ohio and Nebraska, 2000\nSwimming is the second most popular exercise in the United States with approximately 400 million pool visits annually . During the summer of 2000, five outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis linked to swimming pools were reported to CDC. This report summarizes the investigations of two of these outbreaks involving approximately 1000 cases and provides recommendations to reduce the transmission of pool-related disease.\n\n【4】 #Ohio\nIn July 2000, the Delaware City/County Health Department (DCCHD) learned of several laboratory-confirmed cases of cryptosporidiosis potentially linked to a private swim club. To determine associated exposures, DCCHD, in collaboration with the Ohio State Health Department and CDC, conducted an investigation.\nA descriptive study and two telephone-based case-control studies were conducted: a community-based study to examine potential sources of the outbreak and a swim clubbased study to identify club-related risk factors. Persons were asked about source of drinking water, recent travel, visits to pools and lakes, swimming behaviors, contact with ill persons or young animals, and day care attendance.\nA clinical case was defined as diarrhea (three loose stools during a 24-hour period) in a person for at least 1 day. A laboratory-confirmed case was defined as diarrhea, vomiting, or abdominal cramps in a person and a stool specimen that tested positive for Cryptosporidium parvum. All case-patients were in central Ohio during June 17-August 18. Case-patients and controls were frequency matched by age. DCCHD identified 700 clinical cases among residents of Delaware County and three neighboring counties. The outbreak began in late June and continued through September . The club closed during July 28-August 4. Of 268 stool samples submitted to DCCHD, 186 (70%) tested positive for Cryptosporidium; 47 laboratory-confirmed casepatients were enrolled in the two case-control studies. The median age of these casepatients was 6 years (range: 1-46 years) and 28 (61%) were female. The median duration of illness was 7 days (range: 1-36 days). Symptoms included diarrhea (91%), loss of appetite (87%), abdominal cramps (83%), and vomiting (35%). Nearly half (45%) reported intermittent diarrhea. Swimming at the private club was strongly associated with illness in the community case-control study. Of the 47 case-patients, 40 (93.6%) went swimming in the pool, compared with 24 (55%) of 44 controls (odds ratio =42.3; 95% confidence interval =12. 3-144.9). In the club-based case-control study, activities that increased the risk for pool water getting in the mouth (e.g. standing under a pool sprinkler) increased the risk for illness (=8.4; 95% CI=1.8-54.8). At least five fecal accidents, one of which was diarrheal, were observed.\n\n【5】 #Nebraska\nIn August 2000, the Douglas County Health Department, Nebraska, detected an increase in laboratory-reported cases of cryptosporidiosis. Initial cases were linked to a private club with swimming facilities (club A). Additional case-patients reported swimming at club A, at another nearby private club (club B), or at other local pools. The pools at clubs A and B subsequently closed for 2 weeks in mid-August.\nA case-control study was conducted at club A to identify community and club-specific risk factors. A clinical case was defined as diarrhea (three loose stools during a 24-hour period) in a person who was a member of club A. A laboratory-confirmed case was defined as diarrhea, vomiting, or cramps in a person who had a stool specimen that tested positive for Cryptosporidium. All case-patients were in the Douglas County area during June 3-September 28. Members of club A with laboratory-confirmed or clinical cases of cryptosporidiosis were enrolled in the study. Controls were randomly selected from the club A membership list and frequency matched by age.\nThe median duration of diarrhea was 7 days (range: 1-44 days), and nearly half (46%) of patients reported intermittent diarrhea. Thirty-seven case-patients and 36 controls were included in the case-control study at club A. Illness was associated with swimming at club A (=5.0; 95% CI=1.48-17.7) and having been splashed with pool water (=5.3; 95% CI=1.6-18.9).\nSwimmers often swam at multiple pool facilities and swim/dive team meets were held at both clubs A and B. Approximately 18% of the case-patients reported swimming while symptomatic, and nearly one third (32%) swam either during illness or during the 2-week period after symptoms subsided. Fecal accidents were observed at both clubs.g. swimming pools appear to have increased in recent years with most being caused by Cryptosporidium  and the low  6 make it possible for a single fecal accident to sufficiently contaminate an entire pool such that accidental ingestion of a few mouthfuls of water can result in infection.\nThe protracted nature of these two outbreaks highlights the challenges faced by health departments and pool managers in detecting and controlling pool-associated cryptosporidiosis outbreaks. The outbreaks went unreported for several weeks, possibly because ill persons often do not seek health care for diarrheal illness (U.S. Department of Agriculture, unpublished data, 1997). During this time, ill persons continued to swim, increasing the likelihood that contamination of the pools continued to occur. It is unclear whether extended pool closure reduced the potential for exposure or contributed to transmission at other pools. A multicomponent approach to outbreak prevention is needed that combines education of swimmers and pool staff, pool design modifications, and improved operations and maintenance procedures.\nImproved design and management of pools also may reduce the risk for disease transmission. Public health officials and pool operators should consider 1 using separate filtration systems for \"kiddie\" pools and other pools to decrease the potential for cross-contamination; 2 optimizing filtration rates of kiddie pools without facilitating suction injuries to decrease the length of time that swimmers would be exposed to pathogens; and 3 ensuring that restrooms and diaper changing areas are close to the pool and are clean and adequate in number. Management practices should 1 reinforce that pool operators regularly maintain and monitor pH and free residual chlorine levels to help prevent transmission of most waterborne pathogens; 2 develop policies for pool disinfection following a fecal accident ; 3 train staff about prevention of recreational water illness transmission; and 4 institute frequent restroom breaks for young swimmers to reduce the potential for fecal accidents.\nDuring a pool-associated or other local outbreak of cryptosporidiosis, extra vigilance is necessary to prevent swimming-related disease transmission. Those at risk for serious illness (e.g. immunocompromised persons) should consider not swimming during an outbreak. In addition, because persons ill with cryptosporidiosis often have intermittent diarrhea and Cryptosporidium can be excreted for several weeks after diarrhea subsides , ill swimmers should refrain from swimming while ill with diarrhea and should also not swim for a 2-week period after cessation of diarrhea. Operators of implicated pools should intensify education efforts and consider prohibiting diaper-and toddleraged children from swimming during the outbreak. In addition, health officials should alert pool operators in the geographic area so they can undertake intensive education efforts to prevent infected persons from swimming in and potentially contaminating their pools. Further evaluation is needed to determine the efficacy of extended pool closures on preventing Cryptosporidium transmission\n\n【6】 #Prevalence of Parasites in Fecal Material from Chlorinated Swimming Pools -United States, 1999\nAs a result of the 1998 outbreak of infection with the chlorine-sensitive pathogen Escherichia coli O157:H7 at a waterpark in Georgia , many public health departments updated their guidelines for disinfecting pools following a fecal accident. Many of these guidelines recommended treating all fecal accidents as if they contained the highly chlorine-resistant parasite Cryptosporidium parvum , generally resulting in hyperchlorination and pool closures of up to a day. To determine whether fecal accidents commonly contained Cryptosporidium, the prevalence of this parasite and the moderately chlorine sensitive parasite Giardia intestinalis  was assessed by asking swimming pool operators throughout the United States to collect formed stools from fecal accidents in their pools. This report summarizes the results of this study and provides recommendations for disinfecting pools following fecal accidents.\nDuring 1999, 47 swimming pools, waterparks, or aquatics centers were enrolled in the survey by telephone. Sample collection began Memorial Day weekend (May 29) and ended after Labor Day weekend (September 6). Samples of each fecal accident were collected into vials containing 10% formalin. Labels included no pool-specific identifiers. Samples were tested for Cryptosporidiumand Giardia-specific stool antigen without prior concentration. All positive specimens were verified using an immunofluorescent antibody mixture specific to Cryptosporidium and Giardia followed by microscopic identification.\n\n【7】 #Parasites in Chlorinated Swimming Pools -Continued\nNone of 293 formed stools from fecal accidents collected by pool operators contained Cryptosporidium. Giardia was found in 13 (4.4%) of the samples. Because this study addressed parasite prevalence in only formed stool, no information relating to disinfection procedures for diarrheal fecal accidents was obtained.e. swimming and wading pools, waterparks, fountains, hot tubs, and spas have gradually increased . During 1989-1998, approximately 10,000 cases of diarrheal illness were associated with 32 recreational waterborne disease outbreaks in disinfected water venues in the United States. Ten outbreaks occurred during 1997-1998, the highest number of recreational water outbreaks ever reported . Because diarrheal illness is underreported to public health authorities, the number of outbreaks associated with recreational water use is probably higher . The number of swimming exposures in the United States (approximately 400 million annual visits)  and increasing attendance at high capacity recreational water venues provide strong incentives to review and improve recommendations to reduce the transmission of gastrointestinal illness resulting from recreational water use.\nBecause swimming typically involves sharing water with many other persons in a pool, the water contains various bodily fluids, fecal matter, dirt, and debris that wash off bodies during swimming activities. Fecal matter is regularly introduced into the water when someone has a fecal accident through release of formed stool or diarrhea into the water, or residual fecal material on swimmers' bodies is washed into the pool. Fecal contamination may be more likely to occur when there is a high density of bathers, particularly diaper-and toddler-aged children. Swallowing this fecally contaminated water is the primary mode for transmission of enteric pathogens in recreational water outbreaks.\nAlthough chlorine is an effective disinfectant, it does not instantly kill all pathogens . In addition, some pathogens, such as the parasite Cryptosporidium, are highly resistant to chlorine concentrations routinely used in pools . Because of frequent fecal contamination, the inability of chlorine disinfection to rapidly inactivate several pathogens and the common occurrence of accidental ingestion of pool water, transmission of pathogens can occur even in well-maintained pools.\nThe low prevalence of Cryptosporidium in formed fecal accidents in this study indicates that regulators can adopt less stringent disinfection guidelines by disinfecting pool water as if it contained the moderately chlorine-resistant parasite Giardia. Although there is a large differential between inactivation times for Cryptosporidium, Giardia, and E. coli (approximately 7 days, <1 hour, and <1 minute, respectively, at 1 mg/L free available chlorine ), responding to formed fecal accidents with water treatment sufficient to inactivate Giardia also should be sufficient to inactivate other known viral and bacterial waterborne pathogens, including E. coli O157:H7 .\nOn the basis of these findings, CDC has prepared recommendations for responding to fecal accidents in disinfected recreational water venues . These recommendations assume the presence of Giardia in formed stool accidents and the presence of Cryptosporidium in diarrheal accidents. The prevalence of Cryptosporidium in diarrhetic and nondiarrhetic stools requires further investigation.\nThe Giardia inactivation guidelines are based on data developed by the Environmental Protection Agency for disinfection of Giardia in drinking water . Pool operators should consult with their local or state health authorities for specific fecal accident disinfection procedures. These recommendations are intended to minimize infectious disease transmission by observed fecal accidents (primarily formed stool); however, the unique circulation patterns found in pools often result in areas of poor pool circulation (i.e. \"dead spots\") making it unlikely that disease transmission can be fully prevented. In addition, the higher risk associated with diarrheal accidents, which may rarely be observed and/or responded to, makes it important that public health professionals and the aquatics industry address other critical recreational water illness prevention components. These may include improving aquatics industry policies, planning, and practices and educating aquatics staff and patrons about the potential for recreational water illness transmission. Swimmers should be informed by public health professionals and the aquatics industry that healthy swimming practices necessitate that patrons refrain from swimming while ill with diarrhea and avoid swallowing pool water. Improved hygiene before and during swimming (e.g. showering, handwashing, frequent restroom breaks for young children, and appropriate diaper changing) also should be promoted\n\n【8】 #Drowning -Louisiana, 1998\nDrowning is the third leading cause of death from unintentional injuries in Louisiana. In 1998, the fatality rate from drowning for Louisiana residents was 3.1 per 100,000 population, higher than the U.S. rate of 1.9 per 100,000, and more than twice the 2000 national target of 1.3 per 100,000 population. This report describes the demographics and risk factors associated with drownings in Louisiana in 1998. Findings indicate that alcohol or illicit drug use was found in approximately 60% of tested victims aged >13 years and that none of the victims of boating-related drowning were correctly wearing a personal flotation device (PFD). Prevention efforts should focus on decreasing alcohol and illicit drug use and increasing the proper use of PFDs among boaters and others involved in water recreation.\nThe Louisiana Office of Public Health examined three sources of data on persons who died by drowning: 1998 death certificates, coroners' records, and records of investigations performed by the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries (LDWF). A case was defined as death in a resident of Louisiana coded on the death certificate as having drowned in the state during 1998. Using death certificates, 137 cases were identified. Of these, 114 investigative reports were reviewed: 96 with coroners' records, six with LDWF reports, and 12 with both; investigative reports for 23 (17%) cases could not be obtained. In addition, modifiable risk factors were analyzed. Alcohol and illicit drug use were examined in the deaths of persons aged >13 years. Use was determined by the presence of ethanol or metabolites of illicit drugs in samples collected at autopsy. Among deaths that occurred in a swimming pool, pool fencing was described as present or absent, and PFD use was recorded for investigative reports of boating-related drowning.\nOf the 137 drowning cases, 115 (84%) occurred among males. Blacks and whites died in almost equal numbers, 68 (50%) and 67 (49%), respectively; however, the rate of drowning among blacks was more than twice the rate of whites, 4.8 per 100,000 and 2.3 per 100,000, respectively. The median age of drowned persons was 32 years (range: 10 months-94 years). The highest drowning rate was among persons aged 25-35 years (3.8 per 100,000). Children aged <4 years accounted for 10% of the total deaths and had the second highest rate (3.5 per 100,000). Among those cases in which the manner of death could be determined, 122 (95%) were classified as \"accident\" (unintentional); seven (5%) were classified as suicide. Twelve (9%) drowning deaths were work-related.\nAmong the 19 deaths that occurred in a swimming pool, 11 (58%) were in children aged <14 years. Children aged <4 years died in swimming pools at the highest rate (1.3 per 100,000). The presence or absence of fences was noted in eight (42%) deaths. Six pools had and two did not have fencing. May 25, 2001\n\n【9】 #Drowning -Continued\nCoroner and LDWF reports indicated that 35 (31%) of 114 deaths occurred during boating-related activities: 11 (31%) involved a fall from the boat, seven (20%) occurred when the boat capsized, and six (17%) involved a collision. Five (14%) persons who drowned had entered the water voluntarily, and six (17%) had entered the water for unknown reasons. PFD use was recorded for 22 (63%) boating-related drownings; only one decedent had been wearing a PFD and it was unfastened. Among persons aged >13 years, 34 drownings occurred; 13 (48%) tested positive for alcohol or illicit drugs. Drowning in Louisiana occurred most often in natural bodies of water. Approximately 30% of the deaths during 1998 were associated with boating, which is proportionately more than in the entire United States, where boating accounts for 20% of drowning . In this investigation, the findings indicated that alcohol or illicit drug use was present in nearly half of the tested boating-related deaths among persons aged >13 years, that none of the boating-related decedents had been wearing a PFD correctly, and that during 1998, drowning in swimming pools accounted for 17% of deaths, with children aged <4 years at highest risk. Louisiana state regulations pertaining to alcohol use focus only on boat operators, and state regulations on wearing PFD pertain only to children aged <13 years.\nThe findings in this report are subject to at least two limitations. First, some investigative reports were not available. Second, risk factor information was missing in many of the reports that were examined. Both of these limitations could effect the reported prevalence of risk behaviors.\nBy analyzing the state-level data described in this report, the Louisiana Office of Public Health determined that drowning prevention efforts should include: 1 decreasing alcohol and illicit drug use among both boating passengers and operators; 2 focusing on the proper use of PFDs not only among children but among persons of all ages; and 3 instructing caretakers to supervise children and maintain adequate fencing around swimming pools . For a pool fence to protect against drowning, the fence must completely enclose the pool and must be at least 4 feet high with vertical openings <4 inches wide and with a functional self-latching gate . All of these prevention efforts need to be delivered in a manner culturally appropriate for the highest risk populations.\n\n【10】 #National Safe Boating Week -May 19-25, 2001\nNational Safe Boating Week is May 19-25, 2001. Boating safety improved in the United States throughout the 1990s. Despite a 15% increase in boats registered, the boating fatality rate declined 32% from 1990 to 1999. However, boating-related deaths continue to occur. In 1999, 734 persons died in boating incidents. Boaters routinely should adopt safety practices.\nAll boaters should wear personal flotation devices (PFDs). Capsizing and falling overboard account for more than half of all recreational boating deaths each year . Although all states and territories (except Guam, Hawaii, and Idaho) have regulations on wearing life jackets, most affect only children aged <12 years.\nBoaters should avoid alcoholic beverages while boating. Alcohol use affects judgment, vision, balance, and coordination. Approximately one third of all deaths caused by a collision involved alcohol use.\nBoaters should be aware of the risk for carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning. Potential sources of CO poisoning include using air conditioning powered by an onboard motor generator, operating a gasoline powered engine while docked and/or rafted with other boats operating engines, or being underway with improper cabin ventilation. To avoid CO poisoning, boaters should have sufficient ventilation, properly install and maintain equipment, and use CO detectors.\nAdditional\n\n【11】 #MMWR May 25, 2001\nNotice to Readers -Continued\n\n【12】 #Responding to Fecal Accidents in Disinfected Swimming Venues\nThese recommendations are solely for management of fecal accidents in disinfected recreational water venues. The recommendations do not address use of other nonchlorine disinfectants because there is limited pathogen inactivation data for many of these compounds. Because improper handling of chlorinated disinfectants could cause injury, appropriate occupational safety and health requirements should be followed.\nA. Formed stool (solid, nonliquid)\n1. Direct everyone to leave all pools into which water containing the feces is circulated. Do not allow anyone to enter the contaminated pool(s) until all decontamination procedures are completed.\n2. Remove as much of the fecal material as possible using a net or scoop and dispose of it in a sanitary manner. Clean and disinfect the net or scoop (e.g. after cleaning, leave the net or scoop immersed in the pool during disinfection). Vacuuming stool from the pool is not recommended*.\n3. Raise the free available chlorine concentration to 2 mg/L, pH 7.2-7.5, if it is <2.0 mg/L. Ensure this concentration is found throughout all co-circulating pools by sampling at least three widely spaced locations away from return water outlets. This free available chlorine concentration was selected to keep the pool closure time to approximately 30 minutes. Other concentrations or closure times can be used as long as the CT inactivation value  is kept constant .\n4. Maintain the free available chlorine concentration at 2.0 mg/L, pH 7.2-7.5, for at least 25 minutes before reopening the pool. State or local regulators may require higher free available chlorine levels in the presence of chlorine stabilizers such as chlorinated isocyanurates  . Ensure that the filtration system is operating while the pool reaches and maintains the proper free available chlorine concentration during the disinfection process.\n5. Establish a fecal accident log. Document each fecal accident by recording date and time of the event, formed stool or diarrhea, free available chlorine concentration at the time or observation of the event and before opening the pool, the pH, the procedures followed to respond to the fecal accident (including the process used to increase free chlorine residual if necessary), and the contact time.\n\n【13】 #B. Diarrhea (liquid stool)\n1.  A1.\n3. Raise the free available chlorine concentration to 20 mg/L  and maintain the pH between 7.2 and 7.5. Ensure this concentration is found throughout all co-circulating pools by sampling at least three widely spaced locations away from return water outlets. This chlorine and pH level should be sufficient to inactivate Cryptosporidium and should be maintained for at least 8 hours, equivalent to a CT inactivation value of 9600. A higher or lower free available chlorine level/inactivation time can be used as long as a CT inactivation value equaling 9600 is maintained for Cryptosporidium inactivation. State or local regulators may require higher free available chlorine levels in the presence of chlorine stabilizers such as chlorinated isocyanurates. If necessary, consult an aquatics professional to determine and identify the feasibility, practical methods, and safety considerations before attempting the hyperchlorination of any pool.\n4. Ensure that the filtration system is operating while the pool reaches and maintains the proper free available chlorine concentration during disinfection.\n5. Backwash the filter thoroughly after reaching the CT value. Be sure the effluent is discharged directly to waste and in accordance with state or local regulations. Do not return the backwash through the filter. Where appropriate, replace the filter media.\n6. Swimmers may be allowed into the pool after the required CT value has been achieved and the free available chlorine level has been returned to the normal operating range allowed - No uniform recommendations for disinfection of vacuum systems are available. However, if a vacuum system is accidentally used, the waste should be discharged directly to a sewer or other approved waste disposal system and not through the filtration system. The dilution effect of the pool water going through the hose may reduce the risk for high-level contamination of the vacuum system.  CT refers to concentration (C) of free available chlorine in mg/L or ppm multiplied by time (T) in minutes. If pool operators want to use a different chlorine concentration or inactivation time, they need to ensure that CT values always remain the same. For example, if an operator finds a formed fecal accident in the pool and his pool has a free available chlorine reading of 3 mg/L and a pH of 7 The pool should be closed for 19 minutes. Example 2: The CT inactivation value for Cryptosporidium is 9600, which equals (20 mg/L)(480 minutes) (i.e. 8 hours). After a diarrheal accident in the pool, an operator determines she can only maintain 15 mg/L. How long would hyperchlorination take? Answer: 9600=CT=;T=9600/15=640 minutes=10.7 hours.  The impact of chlorine stabilizers (e.g. chlorinated isocyanurates) on pathogen inactivation and disinfectant measurement is unclear and requires further investigation. State or local regulations on chlorinated isocyanurates use should be consulted.  Many conventional test kits cannot measure free available chlorine levels this high. Use chlorine test strips that can measure free available chlorine in a range that includes 20mg/L (such as those used in the food industry) or make dilutions for use in a standard DPD (N, N-diethyl-p-phenylenediamine) test kit using chlorine-free water.

Aventis Pasteur (Swiftwater, Pennsylvania) is the only major manufacturer of tetanus and Td in the United States. In response to the shortage, Aventis Pasteur has increased production of Td to meet national needs; however, because 11 months are required for vaccine production, the shortage is expected to last for the remainder of 2001.\nTo assure vaccine availability for priority indications , all routine Td boosters in adolescents and adults should be delayed until 2002. Td use should follow existing recommendations for all other indications, which include 1 persons traveling to a country where the risk for diphtheria is high*; 2 persons requiring tetanus vaccination for prophylaxis in wound management; 3 persons who have received <3 doses of any vaccine containing Td; and 4 pregnant women who have not been vaccinated with Td during the preceding 10 years.\nCDC recommends that health-care providers, including clinic personnel, record the names of patients whose booster dose is delayed during the shortage. When Td supplies are restored, these patients should be notified to return to their health-care provider for vaccination. According to Aventis Pasteur, sufficient vaccine will be available in early 2002 to supply the national demand.\nHealth-care providers using Td for wound management should follow recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices for wound management . All wound patients should receive Td if they have received 3 doses of TT-containing vaccine and severe or contaminated wounds, Td should be given only if >5 years have passed since the last dose of tetanuscontaining vaccine. For clean and minor wounds, Td should be given only if the patient has not received a tetanus-containing vaccine during the preceding 10 years. Healthcare providers should inquire from patients presenting for wound management about the timing of their last tetanus-containing vaccine to avoid unnecessary vaccination.\nPediatric formulations of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids (DT) and diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP) should not be used for persons aged >7 years. Although TT might be considered a substitute for Td in wound management Because of changes in reporting methods in this Pennsylvania city, these numbers are partial counts for the current week. Complete counts will be available in 4 to 6 weeks.  Total includes unknown ages.\n\n【15】 #Contributors to the Production of the MMWR (Weekly)\nWeekly when Td is not available, TT is not available for national distribution. Existing stocks of TT are extremely limited and are mainly reserved for production of tetanus immune globulin and other special circumstances. Health-care providers and institutions requiring Td for priority indications should contact Aventis Pasteur, telephone  822-2463 or  VACCINE. Institutions should place orders for their anticipated needs for priority indications only. Limiting quantities of vaccine in each order is necessary to assure the widest possible distribution of available vaccine. For emergency situations (e.g. natural disasters) requiring increased use of Td, Aventis Pasteur can provide vaccine within 24 hours.\n\n【16】 #The Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) Series is prepared by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and is available free of charge in electronic format and on a paid subscription basis for paper copy.\n\n【17】 Data in the weekly MMWR are provisional, based on weekly reports to CDC by state health departments.

Cirrhosis is associated with an annual incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma of 3 to 5 percent.\nHepatocarcinogenesis represents a multi-step process in which both genetic abnormalities and epigenetic alterations encourage the malignant transformation of hepatocytes. Hepatocellular carcinomas are associated with up-regulated signal transduction through multiple pathways (e.g. mitogen-activated protein kinase, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor).\nPrognosis depends upon the extent of hepatic replacement by the tumour, the α-fetoprotein (AFP) level, the patient's performance status , the tumour's histologic subtype ,e.g\n\n【1】 #Guideline Questions\n- What are the goals of therapy and recommendations for the treatment of adult patients with: o very early stage hepatocellular carcinoma? o early stage hepatocellular carcinoma? o intermediate stage hepatocellular carcinoma? o advanced stage hepatocellular carcinoma? o terminal stage hepatocellular carcinoma?\n\n【2】 #Search Strategy\nThis guideline was developed to promote evidence-based practice in Alberta. It was compiled from the results of randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews, derived from an English language and relevant term search of PubMed and MEDLINE from 1990 forward. It takes into consideration related information presented at local, national, and international meetings as well as the Alberta Provincial Gastrointestinal Tumour Team's interpretation of the data. The 2021 update did not necessitate a full literature review; recommendations were modified based on a consensus discussion at the 2020 Annual Gastrointestinal Tumour Team Meeting.\n\n【3】 #Target Population\nThe recommendations outlined in this guideline apply to adults over the age of 18 years with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Different principles may apply to pediatric patients.\nThe American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) promotes routine HCC surveillance for all adult patients with Child-Pugh A or B cirrhosis. 2 Screening and surveillance using liver ultrasound, with or without α-fetoprotein (AFP), is recommended every six months. Patients with Child-Pugh C cirrhosis are not recommended for surveillance due to low anticipated survival unless these patients are on a liver transplant waiting list .\nPatients with hepatitis B are also considered at risk; screening is recommended starting at age 40 for Asian males, age 50 for Asian females and age 20 for those of African descent. 2 The American College of Radiology  algorithm developed by the ACR. This algorithm allows definitive diagnosis of HCC in high risk patients without pathologic confirmation The key imaging features include size ≥ 1 cm, arterial phase hyperenhancement (APHE), and a combination of washout, threshold growth and capsule appearance. 6 If these features are not present but HCC is suspected, then a liver biopsy should be considered. A biopsy should also be considered in patients with a liver mass that is atypical of HCC on contrast-enhanced imaging 2 . If high-grade dysplasia and HCC are not disguisable by routine histology alone, tumour markers glypican-3 (GPC3), heat-shock protein 70 (HSP70) and glutamine synthetase (GS) can be assessed.\n\n【4】 #Goals and Recommendations\nTo define and provide optimal care to a patient with HCC, a multidisciplinary team (MDT) is required.\nIt should be composed of hepatobiliary surgeons, diagnostic and interventional radiologists, hepatologists/gastroenterologists, and oncologists. Consideration is given to patient factors (e.g. functional status, co-morbidities, liver function) and tumour factors (e.g. size, number, location, vascular invasion).\nThe Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging system  provides a system to define the care for patients with HCC. 7,8 It links the TNM staging system , the patient's ECOG performance status , and the patient's liver function  to treatment options. An algorithm for management of HCC according to the updated AHS clinical practice guideline recommendations is provided .\nConsider treatment on a clinical trial, if available. - Well-compensated liver function (Child-Pugh class A). Tumour Requirements: - Solitary tumour (< 2 cm) confined to one lobe of the liver.\n- Absence of vascular invasion and extra-hepatic disease.\n- Complete removal of the tumour with a margin of ≥ 1 cm anticipated.\n\n【5】 #Goals:\n- To render patient free of disease and to delay or prevent recurrence. Recommendation:\n- Resection. 10 Resection: - In carefully selected patients, five-year survivals of 50 to 70% are anticipated.\n- Comparative genomic hybridization reveals that 60 to 70% of recurrences are intra-hepatic metastases and that 30 to 40% are de novo tumour development. - Abnormal bilirubin and portal hypertension (as suggested by thrombocytopenia with platelet count under 100, varices, ascites, and/or splenomegaly) predict for failure to benefit from resection. 11 - If extra-hepatic disease is confirmed at laparotomy, resection is not pursued.\n- Intra-operative ultrasound and bi-manual palpation assessment for other intra-hepatic lesions. Intraoperative or subsequent radiofrequency ablation or percutaneous ethanol injection 12,13 can be considered for multicentric disease. - No clear benefit has been established for adjuvant therapy post-resection. In fact, adjuvant chemotherapy may adversely affect the outcome, especially in cirrhotic patients. 14,15 Sorafenib was of no benefit as adjuvant therapy following curative intent resection or radiofrequency ablation (STORM study). 16 - In patients who are not candidates for surgical resection, radiofrequency ablation  can offer a 97% complete response for tumours ≤ 2 cm with long-term survival similar to what has been reported in patients who have undergone resection. 17 - Three randomized controlled trials comparing surgical resection to RFA have been performed in China.\nAlthough the studies had methodological flaws (cross-over between groups), similar outcomes were reported in two studies 18,19 whereas one study demonstrated improved recurrence-free and overall survival in the surgical resection group. 20 Follow-Up: To identify recurrence, obtain a contrast enhanced CT scan, MR, or ultrasound of the abdomen every three months for two years and then every six months thereafter. Obtain an AFP every three months for two years and then every six months thereafter. 21\n\n【6】 #Early Stage HCC\nPatient Requirements:\n- Good performance status (ECOG 0).\n- Well-compensated liver function (Child-Pugh class A). Tumour Requirements: - Solitary tumour confined to one lobe of liver or three nodules (all ≤ 3 cm)\n- Absence of vascular invasion and extra-hepatic disease.\n- Complete removal of the tumour(s) with a margin of ≥ 1 cm anticipated. Goals:\n- To render patient free of disease and to delay or prevent recurrence. Recommendations:\n- Resection , liver transplantation , or ablation 12 . Liver Transplantation:\nRemoves the cancer and corrects the underlying \"field defect\" (cirrhosis) but subjects the patient to the potential complications of long-term immunosuppression. - Offers a five-year disease-free survival of up to 70% and a short-term mortality of up to 10%.\n- In Alberta, transplantation is contraindicated if the total tumour volume (TTV) exceeds 115 cm 3 , the alphafetoprotein exceeds 400 ng/mL, vascular invasion and/or extra-hepatic disease exist, or significant comorbidities exist. - Patients may be considered for liver transplantation after being \"down-staged\" if their initial total tumour volume was under 250 cm 3 and both the total tumour volume and the AFP remain under 115 cm 3 and 400 ng/mL, respectively, for more than six months. 22,23\n\n【7】 #Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA) or Percutaneous Ethanol Injection (PEI):\n- Provides tumour control pending transplantation or as an adjunct or alternative to resection.\n- Recent series of radiofrequency ablation report local recurrence rates under 5% and five-year survivals equal to resection. Radiofrequency ablation requires fewer sessions to ablate tumours and results in improved survival when compared to percutaneous ethanol injection. 24 - Survival rates with radiofrequency ablation may be similar to surgical resection; 18 however, two-year recurrence rates are higher following percutaneous ethanol injection and radiofrequency ablation than with resection. 25 - Best outcomes are achieved from radiofrequency ablation when tumours are centrally located, measure under 3 cm, and are distant from \"heat sinks\" (blood vessels). 11 Consider percutaneous ethanol injection or transarterial chemo-embolization (TACE) when tumours are in a subcapsular location, exceed 4 cm, or are located adjacent to blood vessels. - Hepatocellular carcinomas are considered \"treated\" only if the imaging study demonstrates complete tumour necrosis (without contrast enhancement to suggest residual disease).\n\n【8】 #Patient Requirements:\n- Good performance status (ECOG 0-1).\n- Well-compensated liver function (Child-Pugh class A) and only select patients with impaired liver function (Child-Pugh class B 7). Tumour Requirements:\n- Multinodular disease.\n- Absence of extra-hepatic disease.\n- Patency of the main portal vein (as assessed by ultrasound Doppler or MR angiography) for TACE.\n- Adequate renal function.\n\n【9】 #Goals:\n- To maintain or to improve the patient's quality of life (to control or to delay the onset of tumour-related symptoms, possibly while awaiting transplant).\n- To prolong life, if possible. Recommendations:\n- Transarterial chemo-embolization  or transarterial radioembolization.  Consider palliative care if not an LT candidate.\n\n【10】 #Transarterial Chemo-Embolization (TACE):\n- Blood supply to hepatocellular carcinomas is preferentially derived from the hepatic artery rather than the portal vein. - Involves placement of an intravascular catheter into the hepatic artery (inserted percutaneously in the femoral artery and advanced through the abdominal aorta and celiac trunk). Injection of chemotherapy (with or without the oily contrast agent, Lipiodol) followed by embolic agents (e.g.: gelatin-sponge particles, Embosphere  ) occludes the relevant branch of the hepatic artery and localizes the chemotherapy. Metaanalyses of randomized controlled trials demonstrate a survival benefit of TACE. 35,36 Drug-eluting beads (DEBs) decrease the systemic exposure to doxorubicin. 37 Although DEBs have not been shown to be superior to conventional TACE, they offer a more standardized technique and are better tolerated with fewer complications. 29 Recent cohort studies are demonstrating median survival of 4 years after TACE with DEBs in carefully selected patients. 30 Transarterial Radioembolization (TARE):\n- TARE or selective internal radiotherapy (SIRT) uses microspheres loaded with yttrium-90 (Y 90 ) to deliver radiation directly into the tumour via the hepatic artery. Unlike TACE it is done as an outpatient. Prior to the TARE, the patient requires a staging angiogram to calculate the liver-to-lung shunt fraction in Nuclear Medicine using technicium-99 macro-aggregated albumin (Tc 99 MAA). At the same time selective embolization of the gastroduodenal arteries is carried out to prevent delivery of radiation to the stomach and duodenum. The procedure may be repeated depending upon response.\n- A meta-analysis 38 and large cohort studies from Europe 31 and the USA 32 have shown similar survival to TACE in BCLC stage B patients. However, a separate meta-analysis showed superior survival with TACE in unresectable patients. 39 - TARE, unlike TACE, can be performed safely in patients with portal vein thrombosis, as the microspheres used in TARE are smaller and less embolic. 31,32 - TARE may be considered for patients who have progressive disease after TACE, who cannot tolerate doxorubicin or who are likely to fail TACE (large HCC).\n- TARE may also be more effective than TACE in bridging or down-staging patients to liver transplantation. 33,35\nOutcomes following TARE are best in patients with preserved liver function (Child-Pugh score <8 or MELD score <13). 34 Patients should be selected for TARE at MDT meetings.\n- As there remains uncertainty about TARE efficacy compared to TACE (intermediate stage) or sorafenib (advanced stage), clinical trials are encouraged.\n\n【11】 #Advanced Stage HCC\nPatient Requirements:\n- Good performance status (ECOG 0 or 1).\n- Well-compensated liver function (Child-Pugh class A). Tumour Requirements:\n- Disease ineligible for, or that progressed after, surgical or locoregional therapy. Goals:\n- To maintain or to improve the patient's quality of life (to control or to delay the onset of tumour-related symptoms). - To prolong life, if possible.\n\n【12】 #Recommendations:\n- First-line treatment: Atezolizumab-Bevacizumab , or participation in a clinical trial 36  First-Line Systemic Therapy:\nAtezolizumab-Bevacizumab (Preferred, Type of recommendation: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: moderate to high; Strength of recommendation: strong) 42 - Atezolizumab-bevacizumab was compared to sorafenib in the open-label phase 3 IMbrave150 trial. 43 Hazard ratio for death was 0.58 (95%CI: 0.42-0.79; p<0.001) in favor of atezolizumab-bevacizumab. Last revision: August, 2021\nAdditionally, hazard ratio for disease progression or death was superior in the atezolizumab-bevacizumab arm ,HR: 0.59; 95%CI: 0.47-0.76; p20 kPa or if the platelet count is <150. 46 Patients with incompletely treated varices should not be treated with this combination. - Atezolizumab-Bevacizumab is not currently funded in Alberta\nIn those patients where Atezolizumab-Bevacizumab is not appropriate/contraindicated: Lenvatinib (Type of recommendation: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: moderate to high; Strength of recommendation: strong) - Lenvatinib was shown to be non-inferior to sorafenib for overall survival in an open-label, phase 3, multicenter, non-inferiority trial in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma, who had not received treatment for advanced disease (median OS 13.6m lenvatinib vs 12.3m sorafenib, respectively, HR: 0.92, 95%CI: 0.79-1.06). Patients had Child Pugh A liver function, and ECOG 0-1. 47 - It is worth noting that lenvatinib was superior to sorafenib in terms of progression-free survival (7.4m vs 3.7m, respectively, HR: 0.66, 95%CI: 0.57-0.77, p<0.001). Objective response rates were also higher in the lenvatinib group (24.1% vs. 9.2%, respectively, p<0.001). - Treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or higher occurred in 57% of patients treated with lenvatinib and 49% with sorafenib. Rates of hand-foot syndrome are lower in the lenvatinib arm compared to sorafenib arm. In the lenvatinib arm, the most common any-grade adverse events included hypertension (42%), diarrhea (39%), decreased appetite (34%), and decreased weight ,31% - Hypothyroidism develops in 18% of patients within two to four months of starting Sorafenib. Obtain a baseline TSH and then monitor levels every six weeks. 35,50 - Increases the incidence of arterial thromboembolic events (1.4%, RR 3.03, p = 0.015). 36 Second-Line Systemic Therapy:\n\n【13】 #Lenvatinib (if not received in the first-line)\n- There is no level 1 evidence to inform the most effective treatment after atezolizumab plus bevacizumab.\nThe most common second line therapies received by patients in the IMbrave150 trial were sorafenib (n=31)\n\n【14】 #Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT)\n- There is growing experience with providing ionizing radiotherapy to HCC using very conformal dose distribution, with image guidance and motion management to provide high doses of radiation to the HCC while minimizing exposure to the adjacent liver or other tissues. 53 - SBRT can provide good local control of HCC range (ranging from 43% to 100% at 1 year) which can depend on factors such as lesion size and number, and the delivered radiation dose. It has been used in patients with portal vein invasion 54 and to bridge patients to liver transplantation. 55 - Patients should be discussed at multidisciplinary rounds. SBRT can be considered when alternative therapies such as ablation/embolization techniques have failed or are contraindicated.\n- Patients can experience worsening of liver function with SBRT 54 and tolerance to normal liver is the main dose limiting constraint. Most safety evidence is for patients with Child-Pugh class A disease. Evidence is more limited for Child-Pugh class B disease and in practice treatment dose is lowered to reduce the chance of treatment toxicities. Treatment of patients with Child-Pugh class C disease is not recommended as the safety of liver SBRT in this population has not been determined.\n- Continued clinical trials in the use of liver SBRT are recommended. Studies evaluating SBRT in combination with sorafenib are currently underway. Enrollment of patients into clinical trials or investigational protocols should be encouraged.\n\n【15】 #Patient Requirements:\n- Poor performance status (ECOG > 2).\n- Decompensated liver function (Child-Pugh class B and C). Goals:\n- To maintain or to improve the patient's quality of life (to control tumour-related symptoms). Recommendations:\n- Best supportive care .\n- Palliative chemotherapy may adversely affect outcome\n\n【16】 #This guideline was originally developed in 2009.\nMaintenance A formal review of the guideline will be conducted in 2022.

They are available in many shapes, sizes, and styles.\nThe retractor was invented by Abu al-Qasim, an Islamic physician, over 1000 years ago.\n\n【1】 #History\nSurgical retractors probably originate with very basic tool use in the Stone Age. Branches or antlers of various shapes were used to dig and extract food from the ground. As the use of tools evolved, a variety of instruments came about to substitute for the use of hooked or grasping fingers in the butchering of meat or dissection of bodies. The use of metals in tool making was of great importance. A variety of Roman metal instruments of the hook and retractor family have been found by archeologists. These instruments would generally be called hooks if the end was as narrow as the handle of the instrument. If the end was broad, it would be called a retractor. Also arising from this group of tools were other related tools for displacing (elevators and spatulas) and scooping (spoons and curettes).\nIn a description of the procedure of tonsillectomy from the 7th century CE, Paul of Aegina documents the use of a tongue spatula to keep the tongue out of the way while a form of tonsil hook is used to bring the tonsil forward for excision.\nIn 1000 CE Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi, also known as Albucasis or Abulcasis, described a variety of surgical instruments including retractors in his famous text Al-Tasrif.\nVesalius described a variety of hooks and retractors in the 1500's.\nDr. von Mikulicz invention of a hinged rib spreading retractor in 1904 headed a flurry of development in the early 20th century.\n\n【2】 #Current\nThe following is a list of surgical retractors in current use:\n- Lahey Retractor - Blair (Rollet) Retractor - Rigid Rake\n- Flexible Rake\n- Jackson Tracheal Hook\n- Meyerding Finger Retractor - Goelet Retractor - Richardson Retractor - Parker-Mott Retractor - Mayo-Collins Retractor - U.S. Army Retractor - Self Retaining Retractors\n- Beckman-Weitlaner Retractor", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Common adverse reactions include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramping.\n\n【2】 ### Indications\n- For radiographic visualization of the gastrointestinal tract.\n\n【3】 ### Dosage\n- The volume and concentration of LIQUID E-ZPAQUE to be administered will depend on the degree and extent of contrast required in the area(s) under examination and on the equipment and technique employed.\n- Use undiluted for single contrast filled stomach with small bowel follow-through (typical adult dose: 150 mL to 340 mL); routine small bowel (typical adult dose: 340 mL to 750 mL); followthrough small bowel after double contrast upper GI study (typical adult dose: 340 mL to 750 mL).\nIf the patient is scheduled for an MR study immediately or shortly after an upper GI procedure with this product, the regions of the GI tract which still contain this product may appear as areas of lowered signal intensity (black) with certain pulse sequences.\n\n【4】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Barium Sulfate in adult patients.\n\n【5】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Barium Sulfate in adult patients.\n\n【6】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Pediatric)\nThere is limited information regarding FDA-Labeled Use of Barium Sulfate in pediatric patients.\n\n【7】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Barium Sulfate in pediatric patients.\n\n【8】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Barium Sulfate in pediatric patients.\n\n【9】 #Contraindications\n- This product should not be used in patients with known gastric or intestinal perforation or hypersensitivity to barium sulfate products.\n\n【10】 - Rarely, severe allergic reactions of an anaphylactoid nature, have been reported following administration of barium sulfate contrast agents. Appropriately trained personnel and facilities should be available for emergency treatment of severe reactions and should remain available for at least 30 to 60 minutes following administration, since delayed reactions can occur.\n\n【11】 ### Precautions\n- Diagnostic procedures which involve the use of radiopaque contrast agents should be carried out under the direction of personnel with the requisite training and with a thorough knowledge of the particular procedure to be performed. A history of bronchial asthma, atopy, as evidenced by hay fever and eczema, or a previous reaction to a contrast agent, warrant special attention. Caution should be exercised with the use of radiopaque media in severely debilitated patients and in those with marked hypertension or advanced cardiac disease.\n- Ingestion of this product is not recommended in patients with a history of food aspiration. If barium studies are required in these patients or in patients in whom integrity of the swallowing mechanism is unknown, proceed with caution. If this product is aspirated into the larynx, further administration should be immediately discontinued.\n- Use with caution in patients with complete or nearly complete obstruction of the GI tract.\n\n【12】 ## Clinical Trials Experience\n- Adverse reactions, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramping, accompanying the use of barium sulfate formulations are infrequent and usually mild. Severe reactions (approximately 1 in 1,000,000) and fatalities approximately 1 in 10,000,000 have occurred. Procedural complications are rare, but may include aspiration pneumonitis, barium sulfate impaction, granuloma formation, intravasation, embolization and peritonitis following intestinal perforation, vasovagal and syncopal episodes, and fatalities. It is of the utmost importance to be completely prepared to treat any such occurrence.\n- Due to the increased likelihood of allergic reactions in atopic patients, it is important that a complete history of known and suspected allergies as well as allergic-like symptoms, e.g. rhinitis, bronchial asthma, eczema and urticaria, must be obtained prior to any medical procedure utilizing these products. A mild allergic reaction would most likely include generalized pruritus, erythema or urticaria (approximately 1 in 250,000). Such reactions will generally respond to an antihistamine such as 50 mg of diphenhydramine or its equivalent. In the rarer, more serious reactions (approximately 1 in 1,000,000) laryngeal edema, bronchospasm or hypotension could develop. Severe reactions which may require emergency measures are often characterized by peripheral vasodilation, hypotension, reflex tachycardia, dyspnea, agitation, confusion and cyanosis progressing to unconsciousness. Treatment should be initiated immediately with 0.3 to 0.5 mL of 1:1000 epinephrine subcutaneously. If bronchospasm predominates, 0.25 to 0.50 grams of intravenous aminophylline should be given slowly. Appropriate vasopressors might be required. Adrenocorticosteroids, even if given intravenously, exert no significant effect on the acute allergic reactions for a few hours. The administration of these agents should not be regarded as emergency measures for treatment of allergic reactions.\n- Apprehensive patients may develop weakness, pallor, tinnitus, diaphoresis and bradycardia following the administration of any diagnostic agent. Such reactions are usually non-allergic in nature and are best treated by having the patient lie flat for an additional 10 to 30 minutes under observation.\n\n【13】 ## Postmarketing Experience\nThere is limited information regarding Postmarketing Experience of Barium Sulfate in the drug label.\n\n【14】 #Drug Interactions\n- The presence of barium sulfate formulations in the GI tract may alter the absorption of therapeutic agents taken concomitantly. In order to minimize any potential change in absorption, the separate administration of barium sulfate from that of other agents should be considered.\n\n【15】 ### Pregnancy\nPregnancy Category (FDA):\n- Radiation is known to cause harm to the unborn fetus exposed in utero. Therefore, radiographic procedures should only be used when, in the judgement of the physician, its use is deemed essential to the welfare of the pregnant patient.\n- Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) Pregnancy Category\nThere is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Barium Sulfate in women who are pregnant.\n\n【16】 ### Labor and Delivery\nThere is no FDA guidance on use of Barium Sulfate during labor and delivery.\n\n【17】 ### Nursing Mothers\n- Barium sulfate products may be used during lactation.\n\n【18】 ### Pediatric Use\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Barium Sulfate with respect to pediatric patients.\n\n【19】 ### Geriatic Use\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Barium Sulfate with respect to geriatric patients.\n\n【20】 ### Gender\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Barium Sulfate with respect to specific gender populations.\n\n【21】 ### Race\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Barium Sulfate with respect to specific racial populations.\n\n【22】 ### Renal Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Barium Sulfate in patients with renal impairment.\n\n【23】 ### Hepatic Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Barium Sulfate in patients with hepatic impairment.\n\n【24】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Barium Sulfate in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n\n【25】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\nThere is no FDA guidance one the use of Barium Sulfate in patients who are immunocompromised.\n\n【26】 ### Administration\n- Oral\n- Rectal\n\n【27】 ### Monitoring\nThere is limited information regarding Monitoring of Barium Sulfate in the drug label.\n\n【28】 #IV Compatibility\nThere is limited information regarding IV Compatibility of Barium Sulfate in the drug label.\n\n【29】 #Overdosage\n- On rare occasions following repeated administration, severe stomach cramps, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation may occur. These are transitory in nature and are not considered serious. Symptoms may be treated according to currently accepted standards of medical care.\n\n【30】 ## Structure\n- LIQUID E-Z-PAQUE is a barium sulfate suspension (60% w/v, 41% w/w) for oral administration.

{"seq_id": "39d59e3b-e8e8-4a46-aca4-8c23d60c1a6c", "title": null, "text": "【0】 Aerometeor radiation astronomy\n\"Several times a year an atmospheric river —a long, narrow conveyor belt of storms that stream in relentlessly from the Pacific Ocean—drops inches of rain or feet of snow on the U.S. west coast. Such a system triggered floods and mudslides in central and southern California this past weekend .\"\n\"Atmospheric rivers flow through the sky about a mile above the ocean surface, and may extend across a thousand miles of ocean to the coast. Some bring routine rain but the more intense systems can carry as much water as 15 Mississippi Rivers. The series of storms striking land can arrive for days or, occasionally, weeks on end. They hit west-facing coastlines worldwide, although the U.S. experiences more than most other national coasts.\"\nThe “atmospheric river scale” \"ranks severity and impacts, from category 1 (weak) to category 5 (exceptional).\"\n\"Without a scale, we really had no way to objectively communicate what would be a strong storm or a weak one.\"\n\"Scientists, the media and the public viewed atmospheric rivers as primarily a hazard, but the weaker ARs are quite beneficial. Water managers made it clear to us that a rating scale would be helpful.\"\n\"The scale, published Tuesday in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, ranks atmospheric rivers on five levels:\"\n- Category 1: Weak—primarily beneficial\n- Category 2: Moderate—mostly beneficial, but also somewhat hazardous\n- Category 5—Exceptional—primarily hazardous\n\n【1】 #Atmospheric rivers\nThe particularly intense storm system in the image on the right produced as much as 26 in (66.04 cm) of precipitation in California and up to 17 ft (518.16 cm) of snowfall in the Sierra Nevada during December 17–22, 2010.\nAtmospheric rivers consist of narrow bands of enhanced water vapor transport, typically along the boundaries between large areas of divergent surface air flow, including some frontal zones in association with extratropical cyclones that form over the oceans.\nPineapple Express storms are the most commonly represented and recognized type of atmospheric rivers; they are given the name due to the warm water vapor plumes originating over the Hawaiian tropics that follow a path towards California.\nIntegrated water vapor transport (IVT) is more directly attributed to orographic precipitation, a key factor in the production of intense rainfall and subsequent flooding.\nOn any given day, atmospheric rivers account for over 90% of the global meridional (north-south) water vapor transport, yet they cover less than 10% of the Earth's circumference. Atmospheric rivers are also known to contribute to about 22% of total global runoff.\nThey also are the major cause of extreme precipitation events that cause severe flooding in many mid-latitude, westerly coastal regions of the world, including the West Coast of North America, Western Europe, the west coast of North Africa, the Iberian Peninsula, Iran and New Zealand. Equally, the absence of atmospheric rivers has been linked with the occurrence of droughts in several parts of the world including South Africa, Spain and Portugal.\nThe inconsistency of California's rainfall is due to the variability in strength and quantity of these storms, which can produce strenuous effects on California's water budget, which make California a perfect case study to show the importance of proper water management and prediction of these storms. The significance atmospheric rivers have for the control of coastal water budgets juxtaposed against their creation of detrimental floods can be constructed and studied by looking at California and the surrounding coastal region of the western United States, where atmospheric rivers have contributed 30-50% of total annual rainfall. The Fourth National Climate Assessment (NCA) report, released by the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) on November 23, 2018 confirmed that along the U.S. western coast, landfalling atmospheric rivers \"account for 30%–40% of precipitation and snowpack. These landfalling atmospheric rivers \"are associated with severe flooding events in California and other western states.\"\n\"As the world warms, the \"landfalling atmospheric rivers on the West Coast are likely to increase\" in \"frequency and severity\" because of \"increasing evaporation and higher atmospheric water vapor levels in the atmosphere.\"\nLandfalling ARs were \"responsible for nearly all the annual peak daily flow (APDF)s in western Washington\" from 1998 through 2009.\nThis AR in the image on the left brought a \"stunning\" end to the American West's 5-year drought with \"some parts of California received nearly twice as much rain in a single deluge as normally falls in the preceding 5 months (October–February)\".\n\n【2】 #Anticyclones\nThe Great Red Spot on Jupiter is, in fact, the inverse phenomenon, an anticyclone.\nAn anticyclone is a weather phenomenon defined by the United States National Weather Service's glossary as \"a large-scale circulation of winds around a central region of high atmospheric pressure, clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere, counterclockwise in the Southern Hemisphere\".\nDef. \"a system of winds that spiral out from a centre of high pressure\" is called an anticyclone.\n\"High-pressure weather systems often bring fair weather and relatively clear skies.\n\"The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA’s Aqua satellite acquired this view of a hole in a cloud formation  at 3:00 p.m. local time (05:00 Universal Time) on June 5, 2012. The weather system over the Great Australian Bight cut out the oval-shaped hole from a blanket of marine stratocumulus clouds.\"\n\"Sea-level pressure maps published by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology on June 5 showed that the shape of the cloud hole matched the shape of the high-pressure area. However, the center of high pressure and the cloud hole didn't match precisely; the center of the high was near the western edge of the clear area, about 100 kilometers from the cloud edge.\"\n\"In general, winds blow outward and away from areas of high pressure. As a result, areas of high pressure pull air downward. As the air sinks, it also warms, increasing the rate of evaporation and making it difficult for the air to sustain clouds. Areas of low pressure, by contrast, pull air upward and generate clouds and stormy weather.\"\n\"While low-pressure systems often produce circular cyclonic storms and clouds, high-pressure systems (which are sometimes called anticyclones) can yield large circular areas of clear skies.\"\n\"You could call it an anti-storm.\"\n\"Weather models simulated the cloud formation quite accurately. We checked the Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) forecast, and it really nailed the system.\"\nThe evolution of an anticyclone depends on a few variables such as its size, intensity, moist-convection, Coriolis force etc.\nSurface anticyclones form due to downward motion through the troposphere, in areas within a synoptic flow pattern in higher levels of the troposphere, beneath the western side of troughs, on weather maps, these show converging winds (isotachs), also known as confluence, or converging height lines near or above the level of non-divergence, which is near the 500 hPa pressure surface about midway up the troposphere.\n\n【3】 #Cyclogenesis\nCyclogenesis is the process of cyclone formation and intensification.\nThe anticyclonic equivalent, the process of formation of high pressure systems, dealing with surface systems is anticyclogenesis.\n\n【4】 #Cyclones\nDef. a system of winds rotating around a center of low atmospheric pressure, the more or less violent small-scale circulations such as tornadoes, waterspouts, and dust devils is called a cyclone.\nIn meteorology, a cyclone is a large scale air mass that rotates around a strong center of low atmospheric pressure.\nCyclones are characterized by inward spiraling winds that rotate about a zone of low-pressure.\nThe largest low-pressure systems are polar vortices and extratropical cyclones of the largest scale (the synoptic scale), which includes warm-core cyclones such as tropical cyclones and subtropical cyclones.\nMesocyclones, tornadoes and dust devils lie within the smaller mesoscale.\nUpper level cyclones can exist without the presence of a surface low, and can pinch off from the base of the tropical upper tropospheric trough during the summer months in the Northern Hemisphere.\n\n【5】 #Waterspouts\nA waterspout is an intense columnar vortex (usually appearing as a funnel-shaped cloud) that occurs over a body of water. Some are connected to a cumulus congestus cloud, some to a cumuliform cloud and some to a cumulonimbus cloud. In the common form, it is a non-supercell tornado over water.\nWhile it is often weaker than most of its land counterparts, stronger versions spawned by mesocyclones do occur. Most waterspouts do not suck up water; they are small and weak rotating columns of air over water.\n\n【6】 #Dust devils\nA dust devil is a strong, well-formed, and relatively long-lived whirlwind, ranging from small (half a metre wide and a few metres tall) to large (more than 10 metres wide and more than 1000 metres tall). The primary vertical motion is upward. Dust devils are usually harmless, but can on rare occasions grow large enough to pose a threat to both people and property.\nDust devils form when a pocket of hot air near the surface rises quickly through  cooler air above it, forming an updraft. If conditions are just right, the updraft may begin to rotate. As the air rapidly rises, the column of hot air is stretched vertically, thereby moving mass closer to the axis of rotation, which causes intensification of the spinning effect by conservation of angular momentum. The secondary flow in the dust devil causes other hot air to speed horizontally inward to the bottom of the newly forming vortex. As more hot air rushes in toward the developing vortex to replace the air that is rising, the spinning effect becomes further intensified and self-sustaining. A dust devil, fully formed, is a funnel-like chimney through which hot air moves, both upwards and in a circle. As the hot air rises, it cools, loses its buoyancy and eventually ceases to rise.  As it rises, it displaces air which descends outside the core of the vortex. This cool air returning acts as a balance against the spinning hot-air outer wall and keeps the system stable.\nAs available hot air near the surface is channeled up the dust devil, eventually surrounding cooler air will be sucked in. Once this occurs, the effect is dramatic, and the dust devil dissipates in seconds. Usually this occurs when the dust devil is not moving fast enough (depletion) or begins to enter a terrain where the surface temperatures are cooler.\nOn rare occasions, a dust devil can grow very large and intense, sometimes reaching a diameter of up to 300 feet (90 m) with winds in excess of 60 mph (100 km/h+) and can last for upwards of 20 minutes before dissipating.\nDust devils have been implicated in around 100 aircraft accidents.  While many incidents have been simple taxiing problems, a few have had fatal consequences. Dust devils are also considered major hazards among skydivers and paragliding pilots as they can cause a parachute or a glider to collapse with little to no warning, at altitudes considered too low to cut away, and contribute to the serious injury or death of parachutists.\nA large dust devil measuring about 100 metres (330 ft) across at its base can lift about 15 metric tonnes (17 short tons) of dust into the air in 30 minutes. Giant dust storms that sweep across the world's deserts contribute 8% of the mineral dust in the atmosphere each year during the handful of storms that occur. In comparison, the significantly smaller dust devils that twist across the deserts during the summer lift about three times as much dust, thus having a greater combined impact on the dust content of the atmosphere. When this occurs, they are often called sand pillars.\n\n【7】 #Snow whirlwinds\nThe same conditions can produce a snow whirlwind, although differential heating is more difficult in snow-covered areas.\nA winter waterspout, also known as a snow devil, an icespout, an ice devil, a snownado, or a snowspout, is an extremely rare instance of a waterspout forming under the base of a snow squall.\nLike the more efficient lake-effect snow events, winds focusing down the axis of long lakes enhance wind convergence and likely enhance their development.\n\n【8】 #Coal devils\nCoal devils are common at the coal town of Tsagaan Khad in Ömnögovi Province, South Gobi Province, Mongolia. They occur when dust devils pick up large amounts of stockpiled coal. Their dark color makes them resemble some tornados.\nIn the image on the right, a coal devil occurs at the coal storage town of Tsagaan Khad, Mongolia (15km north from Mongolia-China border). On the way from Oyu Tolgoi mine to the Gashuunsukhait-Ganqimaodao border crossing.\n\n【9】 #Fire whirls\nA fire whirl or swirl, sometimes called fire devils or fire tornadoes, can be seen during intense fires in combustible building structures or, more commonly, in forest or bush fires. A fire whirl is a vortex-shaped formation of burning gases being released from the combustible material. The genesis of the vortex is probably similar to that of a dust devil. As distinct from the dust devil, it is improbable that the height reached by the fire gas vortex is greater than the visible height of the vertical flames because of turbulence in the surrounding gases that inhibit creation of a stable boundary layer between the rotating/rising gases relative to the surrounding gases.\nFire whirls are sometimes colloquially called fire tornadoes, but are not usually classifiable as tornadoes as the vortex in most cases does not extend from the surface to cloud base. Also, even in such cases, those fire whirls very rarely are classic tornadoes, as their vorticity derives from surface winds and heat-induced lifting, rather than from a tornadic mesocyclone aloft, although a handful of suspected cases of the latter are known.\n\n【10】 #Ash devils\nAsh devils form similar to dust devils and are often seen on unstable days in burn scar areas of recent fires.\nHot cinders underneath freshly deposited ash in recently burned areas may sometimes generate numerous dust devils. The lighter weight and the darker color of the ash may create dust devils that are visible hundreds of feet into the air.\n\n【11】 #Steam devils\nSteam devils are phenomena often observed in the steam rising from power plants.\nInclude steam devils in the International Field Year for the Great Lakes which was imminently to occur in 1972-3.\nSteam devils are a rare and short-lived phenomenon, typically surviving no more than three or four minutes, and the smaller ones over hot springs dissipating in a matter of seconds.\nSteam devils can become detached from their base and be blown downstream by the wind. On small bodies of water such as hot springs this can mean that the steam devil ends up over land away from the water altogether. Such steam devils continue to rotate even after they have become detached from the source of heat, but will soon dissipate.\nVery small steam devils may have a poorly defined column and no identifiable clear inner core. Such vortices are more properly called steam whirls by analogy with the dust whirls of land.\n\n【12】 #Extratropical cyclones\nA beautifully-formed low-pressure system swirls off the southwestern coast of Iceland, illustrating the maxim that \"nature abhors a vacuum.\" The vacuum in this case would be a region of low atmospheric pressure. In order to fill this void, air from a nearby high-pressure system moves in, in this case bringing clouds along for the ride. And because this low-pressure system occurred in the Northern Hemisphere, the winds spun in toward the center of the low-pressure system in a counter-clockwise direction; a phenomenon known as the Coriolis force (in the Southern Hemisphere, the Coriolis force would be manifested in a clockwise direction of movement).\nThe clouds in the image resembled pulled cotton and lace as they spun in a lazy hurricane-like pattern. This huge system swirled over the Denmark Strait in between Greenland and Iceland.\n\n【13】 #Jet streams\nDef. any of the high-speed, high-altitude air currents that circle the Earth in a westerly direction is called a jet stream.\nJet streams are fast flowing, narrow air currents found in the atmospheres of some planets, including Earth. The main jet streams are located near the tropopause, the transition between the troposphere (where temperature decreases with altitude) and the stratosphere (where temperature increases with altitude). The major jet streams on Earth are westerly winds (flowing west to east). Their paths typically have a meandering shape; jet streams may start, stop, split into two or more parts, combine into one stream, or flow in various directions including the opposite direction of most of the jet. The strongest jet streams are the polar jets, at around 7  (Expression error: Unexpected round operator. ) above sea level, and the higher and somewhat weaker subtropical jets at around 10  (Expression error: Unexpected round operator. ). The Northern Hemisphere and the Southern Hemisphere each have both a polar jet and a subtropical jet. The northern hemisphere polar jet flows over the middle to northern latitudes of North America, Europe, and Asia and their intervening oceans, while the southern hemisphere polar jet mostly circles Antarctica all year round.\n\n【14】 #Mesocyclones\nA mesocyclone is a vortex of air within a convective storm. Mesocyclones are localized, approximately 2 km (1.242742384 mi) to 10 km (6.21371192 mi) in diameter within strong thunderstorms.\nMesocyclones form when strong changes of wind speed and/or direction with height (\"wind shear\") sets parts of the lower part of the atmosphere spinning in invisible tube-like rolls. The convective updraft of a thunderstorm then draw up this spinning air, tilting the rolls' orientation upward (from parallel to the ground to perpendicular) and causing the entire updraft to rotate as a vertical column.\nThe best way to detect and verify the presence of a mesocyclone is by Doppler weather radar. Nearby high values of opposite sign within velocity data are how they are detected.\n\n【15】 #Polar lows\nPolar lows have been referred to by many other terms, such as polar mesoscale vortex, Arctic hurricane, Arctic low, and cold air depression. Today the term is usually reserved for the more vigorous systems that have near-surface winds of at least 17 m/s (38 mph).\nDuring winter, when cold-core lows with temperatures in the mid-levels of the troposphere reach −45 °C (−49 °F) move over open waters, deep convection forms which allows polar low development to become possible.\nPolar lows can occur at any time during the year.  However, summer lows tend to be weaker than winter lows.\n\n【16】 #Polar vortices\nThe interface between the cold dry air mass of the pole and the warm moist air mass farther south defines the location of the polar front. The polar front is centered, roughly at 60° latitude. A polar vortex strengthens in the winter and weakens in the summer because of its dependence on the temperature difference between the equator and the poles.\nWhen the northern vortex weakens, it separates into two or more vortices, the strongest of which are near Baffin Island, Canada, and the other over northeast Siberia.\nWhen the polar vortex is weak, high-pressure zones of the mid-latitudes may push poleward, moving the polar vortex, jet stream, and polar front equatorward. The jet stream is seen to \"buckle\" and deviate south. This rapidly brings cold dry air into contact with the warm, moist air of the mid-latitudes, resulting in a rapid and dramatic change of weather known as a \"cold snap\".\nThe polar vortex was first described as early as 1853. The phenomenon's sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) develops during the winter in the Northern Hemisphere and was discovered in 1952 with radiosonde observations at altitudes higher than 20 km.\nA deep freeze that gripped much of the United States and Canada in late January 2019 has been blamed on a polar vortex. The US National Weather Service warned that frostbite is possible within just 10 minutes of being outside in such extreme temperatures, and hundreds of schools, colleges and universities in the affected areas were closed. Around 21 people died in US due to severe frostbite. States within the midwest region of the United States had windchills just above -50°F (-45°C), which is colder than the frozen tundra and Antarctica.\nPolar cyclones are low-pressure zones embedded within the polar air masses, and exist year-round. The stratospheric polar vortex develops at latitudes above the subtropical jet stream. Horizontally, most polar vortices have a radius of less than 1,000 kilometres (621.371192 mi). Since polar vortices exist from the stratosphere downward into the mid-troposphere, a variety of heights/pressure levels are used to mark its position. The 50 mb pressure surface is most often used to identify its stratospheric location. At the level of the tropopause, the extent of closed contours of potential temperature can be used to determine its strength. Others have used levels down to the 500 hPa pressure level ,about 5,460 metres  to identify the polar vortex.\n\n【17】 #Subtropical cyclones\nA subtropical cyclone is a weather system that has some characteristics of a tropical and an extratropical cyclone.\nSubtropical cyclones have broad wind patterns with maximum sustained winds located farther from the center than typical tropical cyclones, and have no weather fronts linked into their center.\nThroughout the 1950s and 1960s, the term semi-tropical and quasi-tropical were used for what would become known as subtropical cyclones. The term subtropical cyclone merely referred to any cyclone located in the subtropical belt near and just north of the horse latitudes. Intense debate ensued in the late 1960s, after a number of hybrid cyclones formed in the Atlantic Basin. In 1972, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) finally designated these storms as subtropical cyclones in real-time, and updated the hurricane database to include subtropical cyclones from 1968 through 1971.\n\n【18】 #Subtropical ridges\nHeating of the earth near the equator forces upward motion and convection along the monsoon trough or intertropical convergence zone, then divergence over the near-equatorial trough leads to air rising aloft and moving away from the equator: as air moves towards the mid-latitudes, it cools and sinks leading to subsidence near the 30° parallel of both hemispheres, resulting in circulation known as the Hadley cell which forms the subtropical ridge.\nMany of the world's deserts are caused by these climatological high-pressure areas.\nBecause these anticyclones strengthen with height, they are known as warm core ridges.\n\n【19】 #Tornadoes\nA tornado is a rapidly rotating column of air that is in contact with both the surface of the Earth and a cumulonimbus cloud or, in rare cases, the base of a cumulus cloud. The windstorm is often referred to as a twister, whirlwind or cyclone, although the word cyclone is used in meteorology to name a weather system with a low-pressure area in the center around which, from an observer looking down toward the surface of the earth, winds blow counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern. Tornadoes come in many shapes and sizes, and they are often visible in the form of a condensation funnel originating from the base of a cumulonimbus cloud, with a cloud of rotating debris and dust beneath it. Most tornadoes have wind speeds less than 110 miles per hour (177.02784 km/h), are about 250 feet (Expression error: Missing operand for *. ) across, and travel a few miles (several kilometers) before dissipating. The most extreme tornadoes can attain wind speeds of more than 300 miles per hour (482.8032 km/h), are more than 2 miles (3.218688 km) in diameter, and stay on the ground for dozens of miles (more than 100 km).\nVarious types of tornadoes include the multiple vortex tornado, landspout, and waterspout. Waterspouts are characterized by a spiraling funnel-shaped wind current, connecting to a large cumulus or cumulonimbus cloud. They are generally classified as non-supercellular tornadoes that develop over bodies of water, but there is disagreement over whether to classify them as true tornadoes. These spiraling columns of air frequently develop in tropical areas close to the equator and are less common at high latitudes.\nTornadoes occur most frequently in North America, particularly in central and southeastern regions of the United States colloquially known as tornado alley, as well as in Southern Africa, northwestern and southeast Europe, western and southeastern Australia, New Zealand, Bangladesh and adjacent eastern India, and southeastern South America.\nThere are several scales for rating the strength of tornadoes. The Fujita scale rates tornadoes by damage caused and has been replaced in some countries by the updated Enhanced Fujita Scale. An F0 or EF0 tornado, the weakest category, damages trees, but not substantial structures. An F5 or EF5 tornado, the strongest category, rips buildings off their foundations and can deform large skyscrapers. The similar TORRO scale ranges from a T0 for extremely weak tornadoes to T11 for the most powerful known tornadoes. Doppler radar data, photogrammetry, and ground swirl patterns (trochoidal marks) may also be analyzed to determine intensity and assign a rating.\nTornado formation often occurs in one of two ways.\nIn the first method, two conditions must be satisfied. One, a horizontal spinning effect must form on the Earth's surface. This usually originates in sudden changes in wind direction or speed, known as wind shear. Two, a thundercloud, or occasionally a cumulus cloud, must be present. During a thunderstorm, updrafts are occasionally powerful enough to lift the horizontal spinning row of air upwards, turning it into a vertical air column. This vertical air column then becomes the basic structure for the tornado. Tornadoes that form in this way are often weak and generally last less than 10 minutes.\n\n【20】 #Tropical cyclones\nA tropical cyclone is a rapidly rotating storm system characterized by a low-pressure center, a closed low-level atmospheric circulation, strong winds, and a spiral arrangement of thunderstorms that produce heavy rain. Depending on its location and strength, a tropical cyclone is referred to by different names, including hurricane, typhoon, tropical storm, cyclonic storm, tropical depression, and simply cyclone. A hurricane is a tropical cyclone that occurs in the Atlantic Ocean and northeastern Pacific Ocean, and a typhoon occurs in the northwestern Pacific Ocean; in the south Pacific or Indian Ocean, comparable storms are referred to simply as \"tropical cyclones\" or \"severe cyclonic storms\".\n\n【21】 #Upper level cyclones\nCase studies of upper tropospheric cyclones in the Atlantic and Pacific have been performed by using airplane reports (winds, temperatures and heights), radiosonde data, geostationary satellite cloud imagery, and cloud-tracked winds throughout the troposphere. It was determined they were the origin of an upper tropospheric cold-core lows, or cut-off lows.\nThe tropical upper tropospheric cyclone has a cold core, meaning it is stronger aloft than at the Earth's surface, or stronger in areas of the troposphere with lower pressures. This is explained by the thermal wind relationship.\n\n【22】 #Warm-core cyclones\nThe mechanisms through which tropical cyclogenesis occurs are distinctly different from those through which temperate cyclogenesis occurs. Tropical cyclogenesis involves the development of a warm-core cyclone, due to significant convection in a favorable atmospheric environment.\n\n【23】 #Theoretical aerometeors\nDef. \"movement of  air usually caused by convection or  differences in air pressure\" is called wind.\nDef. a discrete unit of air, wind, or mist traveling or falling through or partially through an atmosphere is called an aerometeor.\nDef. a \"wind whose direction and speed are determined by a balance of the horizontal pressure gradient force and the force due to the earth's rotation to the left in the northern hemisphere and to the right in the southern hemisphere\" is called a geostrophic wind.\nThe chinook generally blows from the southwest, but its direction may be modified by topography. When it sets in after a spell of intense cold, the temperature may rise by 20–40°F in 15 minutes due to replacement of a cold air mass with a much warmer air mass in minutes.\"\n\"Wind shear is a change in wind direction, wind speed, or both, along a given direction in space (e.g. along a horizontal or vertical distance).\"\nDef. a \"strong, abrupt rush of wind\" is called a gust.\n\n【24】 #Radars\nOn the right is a composite of hourly radar images. These wind gusts averaged ~75 mph over about 450 miles. This is referred to as the Derecho event.\n\n【25】 #Mars\n\"The  color images of Mars  were taken in 1999, across almost 60 million miles (!) by a talented amateur astronomer in Oeiras, Portugal – Antonio Cidadao.\"\n\"They were acquired with a modest 10-inch \"Schmidt-Cassegrain\" reflecting telescope, and a commercially available CCD (charge coupled device) camera. Mr. Cidadao’s total investment in his \"Mars imaging system\"—commercial telescope and electronic camera, plus computer to process the images, and the appropriate software—was approximately three thousand American dollars.\"\n\"In 1997, before the arrival of the Mars Pathfinder spacecraft (the first NASA Lander sent to Mars since Viking), the Hubble Telescope was tasked to acquire a series of \"weather forecast Mars images\" prior to the landing .\"\n\"This long-distance reconnaissance detected a small dust storm less than a month before the Pathfinder arrival, which (with its potentially high winds) could have posed a serious threat to the Pathfinder entry and landing.\"\n\"If dust diffuses to the landing site, the sky could turn out to be pink like that seen by Viking. otherwise , Pathfinder will likely show blue sky with bright clouds.\"\nDust devils also occur on Mars  and were first photographed by the Viking orbiters in the 1970s. In 1997, the Mars Pathfinder lander detected a dust devil passing over it. In the image shown here, photographed by the Mars Global Surveyor, the long dark streak is formed by a moving swirling column of Martian atmosphere. The dust devil itself (the black spot) is climbing the crater wall. The streaks on the right are sand dunes on the crater floor.\nMartian dust devils can be up to fifty times as wide and ten times as high as terrestrial dust devils, and large ones may pose a threat to terrestrial technology sent to Mars. On 7 November 2016, five such dust devils ranging in heights of 0.5 to 1.9 km were imaged in a single observation by Mars Orbiter Mission in martian southern hemisphere.\nMission members monitoring the Spirit rover on Mars reported on March 12, 2005, that a lucky encounter with a dust devil had cleaned the solar panels of that robot. Power levels dramatically increased and daily science work was anticipated to be expanded. A similar phenomenon (solar panels mysteriously cleaned of accumulated dust) had previously been observed with the Opportunity rover, and dust devils had also been suspected as the cause.\n\n【26】 #Jupiter\nThe wide equatorial zone is visible in the center surrounded by two dark equatorial belts (SEB and NEB).\n\"The large grayish-blue  \"hot spots\" at the northern edge of the white Equatorial Zone change over the course of time as they march eastward across the planet.\"\n\"The Great Red Spot shows its counterclockwise rotation, and the uneven distribution of its high haze is obvious. To the east (right) of the Red Spot, oval storms, like ball bearings, roll over and pass each other. Horizontal bands adjacent to each other move at different rates. Strings of small storms rotate around northern-hemisphere ovals.\"\n\"Small, very bright features appear quickly and randomly in turbulent regions, candidates for lightning storms.\"\n\"The smallest visible features at the equator are about 600 kilometers (about 370 miles) across.\"\n\"The clip consists of 14 unevenly spaced timesteps, each a true color cylindrical projection of the complete circumference of Jupiter, from 60 degrees south to 60 degrees north. The maps are made by first assembling mosaics of six images taken by Cassini's narrow-angle camera in the same spectral filter over the course of one Jupiter rotation and, consequently, covering the whole planet. Three such global maps -- in red, green and blue filters -- are combined to make one color map showing Jupiter during one Jovian rotation. Fourteen such maps, spanning 24 Jovian rotations at uneven time intervals comprise the movie.\"\nThe passage of time is accelerated by a factor of 600,000.\n\n【27】 #Saturn\n\"The view  from Hubble , taken on March 22, 2004, is so sharp that many individual Saturnian ringlets can be seen.\"\n\"Hubble's exquisite optics, coupled with the high resolution of its Advanced Camera for Surveys, allow it to take pictures of Saturn which are nearly as sharp as Cassini's, even though Hubble is nearly a billion miles farther from Saturn than Cassini.\"\n\"Camera exposures in four filters (blue, blue-green, green, and red) were combined to form the Hubble image, to render colors similar to what the eye would see through a telescope focused on Saturn. The subtle pastel colors of ammonia-methane clouds trace a variety of atmospheric dynamics. Saturn displays its familiar banded structure, and haze and clouds of various altitudes. Like Jupiter, all bands are parallel to Saturn's equator. Even the magnificent rings, at nearly their maximum tilt toward Earth, show subtle hues, which indicate the trace chemical differences in their icy composition.\"\n\n【28】 #Uranus\nIn larger amateur telescopes with an objective diameter of between 15 and 23 cm, the planet appears as a pale cyan disk with distinct limb darkening.\n\"Methane possesses prominent absorption bands in the visible and near-infrared (IR) making Uranus aquamarine or cyan in color.\"\nIn 1986 Voyager 2 found that the visible southern hemisphere of Uranus can be subdivided into two regions: a bright polar cap and dark equatorial bands . Their boundary is located at about -45 degrees of latitude. A narrow band straddling the latitudinal range from -45 to -50 degrees is the brightest large feature on the visible surface of the planet. It is called a southern \"collar\". The cap and collar are thought to be a dense region of methane clouds located within the pressure range of 1.3 to 2 bar . Besides the large-scale banded structure, Voyager 2 observed ten small bright clouds, most lying several degrees to the north from the collar. In all other respects Uranus looked like a dynamically dead planet in 1986. Unfortunately Voyager 2 arrived during the height of the planet's southern summer and could not observe the northern hemisphere. At the beginning of the 21st century, when the northern polar region came into view, the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and Keck telescope initially observed neither a collar nor a polar cap in the northern hemisphere. So Uranus appeared to be asymmetric: bright near the south pole and uniformly dark in the region north of the southern collar. In 2007, when Uranus passed its equinox, the southern collar almost disappeared, while a faint northern collar emerged near 45 degrees of latitude.\nOn August 23, 2006, researchers at the Space Science Institute (Boulder, CO) and the University of Wisconsin observed a dark spot on Uranus's surface, giving astronomers more insight into the planet's atmospheric activity. Why this sudden upsurge in activity should be occurring is not fully known, but it appears that Uranus's extreme axial tilt results in extreme seasonal variations in its weather. Determining the nature of this seasonal variation is difficult because good data on Uranus's atmosphere have existed for less than 84 years, or one full Uranian year. A number of discoveries have been made. Photometry over the course of half a Uranian year (beginning in the 1950s) has shown regular variation in the brightness in two spectral bands, with maxima occurring at the solstices and minima occurring at the equinoxes. A similar periodic variation, with maxima at the solstices, has been noted in microwave measurements of the deep troposphere begun in the 1960s. Stratospheric temperature measurements beginning in the 1970s also showed maximum values near the 1986 solstice. The majority of this variability is believed to occur owing to changes in the viewing geometry.\nThere are some reasons to believe that physical seasonal changes are happening in Uranus. While the planet is known to have a bright south polar region, the north pole is fairly dim, which is incompatible with the model of the seasonal change outlined above. During its previous northern solstice in 1944, Uranus displayed elevated levels of brightness, which suggests that the north pole was not always so dim. This information implies that the visible pole brightens some time before the solstice and darkens after the equinox. Detailed analysis of the visible and microwave data revealed that the periodical changes of brightness are not completely symmetrical around the solstices, which also indicates a change in the meridional albedo patterns. Finally in the 1990s, as Uranus moved away from its solstice, Hubble and ground based telescopes revealed that the south polar cap darkened noticeably (except the southern collar, which remained bright), while the northern hemisphere demonstrated increasing activity, such as cloud formations and stronger winds, bolstering expectations that it should brighten soon. This indeed happened in 2007 when the planet passed an equinox: a faint northern polar collar arose, while the southern collar became nearly invisible, although the zonal wind profile remained slightly asymmetric, with northern winds being somewhat slower than southern.\n\n【29】 #Neptune\nOn July 12, 2011, Neptune \"has arrived at the same location in space where it was discovered nearly 165 years ago. To commemorate the event, NASA's Hubble Space Telescope has taken these \"anniversary pictures\" of the blue-green giant planet.\"\n\"Neptune is the most distant major planet in our solar system. German astronomer Johann Galle discovered the planet on September 23, 1846. At the time, the discovery doubled the size of the known solar system. The planet is 2.8 billion miles (4.5 billion kilometers) from the Sun, 30 times farther than Earth. Under the Sun's weak pull at that distance, Neptune plods along in its huge orbit, slowly completing one revolution approximately every 165 years.\"\n\"These four Hubble images of Neptune were taken with the Wide Field Camera 3 on June 25-26, during the planet's 16-hour rotation. The snapshots were taken at roughly four-hour intervals, offering a full view of the planet. The images reveal high-altitude clouds in the northern and southern hemispheres. The clouds are composed of methane ice crystals.\"\n\"The giant planet experiences seasons just as Earth does, because it is tilted 29 degrees, similar to Earth's 23-degree-tilt. Instead of lasting a few months, each of Neptune's seasons continues for about 40 years.\"\n\"In the Hubble images, absorption of red light by methane in Neptune's atmosphere gives the planet its distinctive aqua color. The clouds are tinted pink because they are reflecting near-infrared light.\"\n\"A faint, dark band near the bottom of the southern hemisphere is probably caused by a decrease in the hazes in the atmosphere that scatter blue light. The band was imaged by NASA's Voyager 2 spacecraft in 1989, and may be tied to circumpolar circulation created by high-velocity winds in that region.\"\n\n【30】 #Meteorology\nThere are four main scales, or sizes of systems, dealt with in meteorology: the macroscale, the synoptic scale, the mesoscale, and the microscale.\nThe macroscale deals with systems with global size, such as the Madden–Julian oscillation.\nSynoptic scale systems cover a portion of a continent, such as extratropical cyclones, with dimensions of 1,000  (Expression error: Unrecognized punctuation character \",\". ) across.\nThe mesoscale is the next smaller scale, and often is divided into two ranges: meso-alpha phenomena range from 200  (Expression error: Unexpected round operator. ) across (the realm of the tropical cyclone), while meso-beta phenomena range from 20  (Expression error: Unexpected round operator. ) across (the scale of the mesocyclone).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

In contrast to peritonitis intrabdominal infection is defined as inflammation of peritoneum due to an infectious cause.\nThe most common cause of peritonitis is perforation of a hollow viscus such as perforation of the distal esophagus (Boerhaave syndrome), of the stomach (peptic ulcer, gastric carcinoma), of the duodenum (peptic ulcer), of the remaining intestine (e.g. appendicitis, diverticulitis, Meckel's diverticulum, IBD, intestinal infarction, intestinal strangulation, colorectal carcinoma, meconium peritonitis), or of the gallbladder (cholecystitis).  Other causes of infected peritonitis include spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and disruption of the peritoneum, such as in cases of  trauma, surgical wounds, continuous peritoneal dialysis, and intra-peritoneal chemotherapy.  Causes of non-infected peritonitis include endometriosis, blunt abdominal trauma, gastric carcinoma, peptic ulcer, pelvic trauma, and pancreatitis.\n\n【2】 #Causes\nCauses of peritonitis can be divided into infected and non-infected, which are as follows:\n\n【3】 ## Classification Based on the clinical view point\nPeritonitis may be classified based on the prognosis into the following types:\n- Uncomplicated: In uncomplicated peritonitis, the infection only involves a single organ and no anatomical disruption is present. Usually, patients with such infections can be managed with surgical resection alone and no antimicrobial therapy besides peri-operative prophylaxis is necessary.\n- Complicated:The infectious process proceeds beyond the organ that is the source of the infection, and causes either localised peritonitis, also referred to as abdominal abscess, or diffuse peritonitis, depending on the ability of the host to contain the process within a part of the abdominal cavity.They are the important cause of morbidity and more frequently associated with poor prognosis.However, an early clinical diagnosis, followed by adequate source control to stop ongoing contamination and restore anatomical structures and physiological function, as well as prompt initiation of appropriate empirical therapy, can limit the associated mortality.\n\n【4】 ## Classification based on the etiological agents\n- Peritonitis, caused by enteric organisms such as E.coli, Klebsiella, staphylococci, streptococci, anaerobes.\n- Aseptic peritonitis resulting from irritation of the peritoneal cavity from the extravasation of fluids such as blood, gastric juice.\n\n【5】 ## Classification based on the pathological alterations in the clinical course of peritonitis - Reactive: In the first 24 hours when there are maximal manifestations of local signs of peritonitis.\n- Toxic: In 24-72 hours, when there is increased general intoxication with a gradual reduction in the local signs of peritonitis.\n- Terminal: It is often the severe stage of peritonitis, usually after 72 hours characterized by irreversible intoxication in the background of a sharply expressed local manifestations of peritonitis.\n\n【6】 ## Pathophysiology\nPeritonitis results from contamination of normal sterile peritoneal cavity with infections or chemical irritants. Release of bile or gastric juices initially causes chemical peritonitis, infection occurs when bacteria enter and contaminate the peritoneal cavity. Bacterial peritonitis is usually caused by normal enteric flora like E.coli, Klebsiella. Inflammatory process causes shift of fluid into the peritoneal cavity(third spacing) which leads to hypovolemia, septicemia and multi-organ failure resulting in death of the patient if not adequately diagnosed and treated early.\n- The main causes of peritonitis are the acute inflammation of the abdominal viscera, discontinuity and increased permeability of their walls, open and closed traumas of the abdomen with the damage of viscera followed by microbial contamination of peritoneal cavity.\n- Despite the cause of peritonitis, the disease is characterized by a typical bacterial inflammation.\n- Chronic peritonitis is caused mainly by extraperitoneal (lungs, lymph nodes) tuberculosis, entering the peritoneal cavity through hematogenous route.\n\n【7】 ## Causes in Alphabetical Order\n- Appendicitis - Bacteroides fragilis - Boerhaave syndrome\n- Cholecystitis - Chronic liver disease\n- Colorectal carcinoma - Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis - Diverticulitis - Endometriosis - Enterobacteriaceae\n- Escherichia coli\n- Fitz-Hugh Curtis syndrome\n- Gall bladder rupture\n- Gastrointestinal perforation\n- IBD\n- Intestinal strangulation\n- Intra-peritoneal chemotherapy\n- Klebsiella pneumoniae\n- Mallory-Weiss syndrome\n- Meconium peritonitis - Neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis - Nephritic syndrome\n- Pancreatitis - Peptic ulcer\n- Pseudomonas\n- Recurrent hereditary polyserositis - Ruptured dermoid cyst\n- Staphylococcus\n- Surgical wounds\n- Systemic lupus erythematosus\n- Toxic megacolon\n- Trauma - Typhlitis - Tuberculosis\n\n【8】 #Natural history, complications and prognosis of peritonitis\nThe stronger predictors of poor outcome both in SBP and secondary BP patients include the concurrent development of sepsis and subsequent multiple organ failure (MOF). Sepsis may progress to conditions of varying severity. There is an increased risk of death along transition from sepsis to severe sepsis and septic shock. With insufficient treatment, sepsis may cause functional impairment of one or more organs or systems and finally lead to MOF. There is a strong correlation between mortality rate and number of failing organs. Several scoring systems have been developed to assess the clinical prognosis of patients with bacterial peritonitis. The most widely used include the APACHE-II, Mannheim Peritonitis Index (MPI), the Multiple Organ Dysfunction Score (MODS), and the Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. Most of the scores are based on host criteria, systemic signs of sepsis, and complications related to organ failure but these scores have limited significance in the specific, day-to-day clinical decision-making process for each individual patient.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Common adverse reactions include tachycardia, orthostatic hypotension, constipation, nausea, and dizziness.\n\n【2】 #Indications\n- For the treatment of schizophrenia; to control nausea and vomiting; for relief of restlessness and apprehension before surgery; for acute intermittent porphyria; as an adjunct in the treatment of tetanus; to control the manifestations of the manic type of manic-depressive illness; for relief of intractable hiccups; for the treatment of severe behavioral problems in children (1 to 12 years of age) marked by combativeness and/or explosive hyperexcitable behavior (out of proportion to immediate provocations), and in the short-term treatment of hyperactive children who show excessive motor activity with accompanying conduct disorders consisting of some or all of the following symptoms: impulsivity, difficulty sustaining attention, aggressivity, mood lability, and poor frustration tolerance.\n\n【3】 #Dosage\nAdults\n- Adjust dosage to individual and the severity of his condition, recognizing that the milligram for milligram potency relationship among all dosage forms has not been precisely established clinically. It is important to increase dosage until symptoms are controlled. Dosage should be increased more gradually in debilitated or emaciated patients. In continued therapy, gradually reduce dosage to the lowest effective maintenance level, after symptoms have been controlled for a reasonable period.\n- Increase parenteral dosage only if hypotension has not occurred.\nELDERLY PATIENTS\nPSYCHOTIC DISORDERS\n- Increase dosage gradually until symptoms are controlled. Maximum improvement may not be seen for weeks or even months. Continue optimum dosage for 2 weeks; then gradually reduce dosage to the lowest effective maintenance level. Daily dosage of 200 mg is not unusual. Some patients require higher dosages (e.g. 800 mg daily is not uncommon in discharged mental patients).\nHospitalized Patients: Acute Schizophrenic or Manic States\nPrompt Control of Severe Symptoms\n- IM: 25 mg (1 mL). If necessary, repeat in 1 hour. Subsequent doses should be oral, 25-50 mg tid.\nNAUSEA AND VOMITING\nDuring Surgery\n- IM: 12.5 mg (0.5 mL). Repeat in 1/2 hour if necessary and if no hypotension occurs. IV: 2 mg per fractional injection, at 2-minute intervals. Do not exceed 25 mg. Dilute to 1 mg/mL, i.e. 1 mL (25 mg) mixed with 24 mL of saline.\nPRESURGICAL APPREHENSION\n- IM: 12.5 to 25 mg (0.5-1 mL), 1 to 2 hours before operation.\nINTRACTABLE HICCUPS\n- If symptoms persist for 2-3 days after trial with oral therapy, give 25 to 50 mg (1-2 mL) IM. Should symptoms persist, use slow IV infusion with patient flat in bed: 25 to 50 mg (1-2 mL) in 500 to 1000 mL of saline. Follow blood pressure closely.\nACUTE INTERMITTENT PORPHYRIA\nTETANUS\nSEVERE BEHAVIORAL PROBLEMS\nOutpatients\n- Select route of administration according to severity of patient’s condition and increase dosage gradually as required. IM: 1/4 mg/lb body weight q6-8h, prn.\n- Dosage and frequency of administration should be adjusted according to the severity of the symptoms and response of the patient. The duration of activity following intramuscular administration may last up to 12 hours. Subsequent doses may be given by the same route if necessary. IM: 1/4 mg/lb body weight q6-8h, prn. Maximum IM Dosage: Pediatric patients 6 months to 5 years (or 50 lbs.), not over 40 mg/day; 5-12 years (or 50-100 lbs.), not over 75 mg/day except in severe cases.\n- 1/4 mg/lb body weight IM 1 to 2 hours before operation.\nImportant Notes on Injection\n- Inject slowly, deep into upper outer quadrant of buttock.\n- Because of possible hypotensive effects, reserve parenteral administration for bedfast patients or for acute ambulatory cases, and keep patient lying down for at least 1/2 hour after injection. If irritation is a problem, dilute injection with saline or 2% procaine; mixing with other agents in the syringe is not recommended. Subcutaneous injection is not advised. AVOID INJECTING UNDILUTED CHLORPROMAZINE HYDROCHLORIDE INJECTION INTO VEIN. IV ROUTE IS ONLY FOR SEVERE HICCUPS, SURGERY AND TETANUS.\n- Because of the possibility of contact dermatitis, avoid getting solution on hands or clothing.\n- Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.\n\n【4】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Chlorpromazine (injection) in adult patients.\n\n【5】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Chlorpromazine (injection) in adult patients.\n\n【6】 #Indications\n- For the treatment of schizophrenia; to control nausea and vomiting; for relief of restlessness and apprehension before surgery; for acute intermittent porphyria; as an adjunct in the treatment of tetanus; to control the manifestations of the manic type of manic-depressive illness; for relief of intractable hiccups; for the treatment of severe behavioral problems in children (1 to 12 years of age) marked by combativeness and/or explosive hyperexcitable behavior (out of proportion to immediate provocations), and in the short-term treatment of hyperactive children who show excessive motor activity with accompanying conduct disorders consisting of some or all of the following symptoms: impulsivity, difficulty sustaining attention, aggressivity, mood lability, and poor frustration tolerance.\n\n【7】 #Dosage\n6 months to 12 years of age\n- Chlorpromazine should generally not be used in pediatric patients under 6 months of age except where potentially lifesaving. It should not be used in conditions for which specific pediatric dosages have not been established.\n\n【8】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Chlorpromazine (injection) in pediatric patients.\n\n【9】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Chlorpromazine (injection) in pediatric patients.\n\n【10】 #Contraindications\n- Do not use in patients with known hypersensitivity to phenothiazines.\n- Do not use in comatose states or in the presence of large amounts of central nervous system depressants (alcohol, barbiturates, narcotics, etc.).\n\n【11】 Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis - Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Chlorpromazine Hydrochloride Injection, USP is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis.\n- The extrapyramidal symptoms which can occur secondary to chlorpromazine may be confused with the central nervous system signs of an undiagnosed primary disease responsible for the vomiting, e.g. Reye’s syndrome or other encephalopathy. The use of chlorpromazine and other potential hepatotoxins should be avoided in children and adolescents whose signs and symptoms suggest Reye’s syndrome.\n- Chlorpromazine Hydrochloride Injection contains sodium metabisulfite and sodium sulfite, sulfites that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in non asthmatic people.\nTardive Dyskinesia - Both the risk of developing the syndrome and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient increase. However, the syndrome can develop, although much less commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses.\n- Given these considerations, antipsychotics should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients who suffer from a chronic illness that, 1 is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs, and, 2 for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. The need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically.\n\n【12】 Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)\n- A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with antipsychotic drugs. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmias).\n- If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. The patient should be carefully monitored, since recurrences of NMS have been reported.\n- Patients with bone marrow depression or who have previously demonstrated a hypersensitivity reaction (e.g. blood dyscrasias, jaundice) with a phenothiazine should not receive any phenothiazine, including chlorpromazine, unless in the judgment of the physician the potential benefits of treatment outweigh the possible hazard.\n- Chlorpromazine may impair mental and/or physical abilities, especially during the first few days of therapy. Therefore, caution patients about activities requiring alertness (e.g. operating vehicles or machinery).\n- The use of alcohol with this drug should be avoided due to possible additive effects and hypotension.\n- Chlorpromazine may counteract the antihypertensive effect of guanethidine and related compounds.\n\n【13】 ## Clinical Trials Experience\n- Note: Some adverse effects of chlorpromazine may be more likely to occur, or occur with greater intensity, in patients with special medical problems, e.g. patients with mitral insufficiency or pheochromocytoma have experienced severe hypotension following recommended doses.\n- Drowsiness, usually mild to moderate, may occur, particularly during the first or second week, after which it generally disappears. If troublesome, dosage may be lowered.\nJaundice\n- Overall incidence has been low, regardless of indication or dosage. Most investigators conclude it is a sensitivity reaction. Most cases occur between the second and fourth weeks of therapy. The clinical picture resembles infectious hepatitis, with laboratory features of obstructive jaundice, rather than those of parenchymal damage. It is usually promptly reversible on withdrawal of the medication; however, chronic jaundice has been reported.\n- If fever with grippe-like symptoms occurs, appropriate liver studies should be conducted. If tests indicate an abnormality, stop treatment.\n- Liver function tests in jaundice induced by the drug may mimic extrahepatic obstruction; withhold exploratory laparotomy until extrahepatic obstruction is confirmed.\n- Hematological Disorders, including agranulocytosis, eosinophilia, leukopenia, hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, thrombocytopenic purpura and pancytopenia have been reported.\nAGRANULOCYTOSIS\n- Warn patients to report the sudden appearance of sore throat or other signs of infection. If white blood cell and differential counts indicate cellular depression, stop treatment and start antibiotic and other suitable therapy.\n- Most cases have occurred between the 4th and 10th weeks of therapy; patients should be watched closely during that period.\nCardiovascular\nHYPOTENSIVE EFFECTS\n- Postural hypotension, simple tachycardia, momentary fainting and dizziness may occur after the first injection; occasionally after subsequent injections; rarely, after the first oral dose. Usually recovery is spontaneous and symptoms disappear within 1/2 to 2 hours. Occasionally, these effects may be more severe and prolonged, producing a shock-like condition.\nEKG CHANGES\n- Particularly nonspecific, usually reversible Q and T wave distortions–have been observed in some patients receiving phenothiazine tranquilizers, including chlorpromazine.\nNote: Sudden death, apparently due to cardiac arrest, has been reported.\nCNS Reactions\nNEUROMUSCULAR (EXTRAPYRAMIDAL) REACTIONS\n- Neuromuscular reactions include dystonia, motor restlessness, pseudo-parkinsonism and tardive dyskinesia, and appear to be dose-related. They are discussed in the following paragraphs:\nDystonia - Class effect: Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups.\nMotor Restlessness\n- Symptoms may include agitation or jitteriness and sometimes insomnia. These symptoms often disappear spontaneously. At times these symptoms may be similar to the original neurotic or psychotic symptoms. Dosage should not be increased until these side effects have subsided.\n- If these symptoms become too troublesome, they can usually be controlled by a reduction of dosage or change of drug. Treatment with anti-parkinsonian agents, benzodiazepines or propranolol may be helpful.\nPseudo-parkinsonism\nTardive Dyskinesia - As with all antipsychotic agents, tardive dyskinesia may appear in some patients on long-term therapy or may appear after drug therapy has been discontinued. The syndrome can also develop, although much less frequently, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses. This syndrome appears in all age groups. Although its prevalence appears to be highest among elderly patients, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict at the inception of antipsychotic treatment which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. The symptoms are persistent and in some patients appear to be irreversible. The syndrome is characterized by rhythmical involuntary movements of the tongue, face, mouth or jaw (e.g. protrusion of tongue, puffing of cheeks, puckering of mouth, chewing movements). Sometimes these may be accompanied by involuntary movements of extremities. In rare instances, these involuntary movements of the extremities are the only manifestations of tardive dyskinesia. A variant of tardive dyskinesia, tardive dystonia, has also been described.\nADVERSE BEHAVIORAL EFFECTS\n- Psychotic symptoms and catatonic-like states have been reported rarely.\nOTHER CNS EFFECTS\n- Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with antipsychotic drugs.\n- Cerebral edema has been reported.\n- Convulsive seizures (petit mal and grand mal) have been reported, particularly in patients with EEG abnormalities or history of such disorders.\n- Abnormality of the cerebrospinal fluid proteins has also been reported.\n- Allergic Reactions of a mild urticarial type or photosensitivity are seen. Avoid undue exposure to sun. More severe reactions, including exfoliative dermatitis, have been reported occasionally.\n- In addition, asthma, laryngeal edema, angioneurotic edema and anaphylactoid reactions have been reported.\nEndocrine Disorders\n- Lactation and moderate breast engorgement may occur in females on large doses. If persistent, lower dosage or withdraw drug. False-positive pregnancy tests have been reported, but are less likely to occur when a serum test is used. Amenorrhea and gynecomastia have also been reported. Hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia and glycosuria have been reported.\nAutonomic Reactions\n- Occasional dry mouth; nasal congestion; nausea; obstipation; constipation; adynamic ileus; urinary retention; priapism; miosis and mydriasis; atonic colon; ejaculatory disorders/impotence.\nSpecial Considerations in Long-Term Therapy\n- Skin pigmentation and ocular changes have occurred in some patients taking substantial doses of chlorpromazine for prolonged periods.\nSKIN PIGMENTATION\nOCULAR CHANGES\nETIOLOGY\nThe etiology of both of these reactions is not clear, but exposure to light, along with dosage/duration of therapy, appears to be the most significant factor. If either of these reactions is observed, the physician should weigh the benefits of continued therapy against the possible risks and, on the merits of the individual case, determine whether or not to continue present therapy, lower the dosage, or withdraw the drug.\nOther Adverse Reactions\n- Mild fever may occur after large IM doses. Hyperpyrexia has been reported. Increases in appetite and weight sometimes occur. Peripheral edema and a systemic lupus erythematosus-like syndrome have been reported.\n\n【14】 ## Postmarketing Experience\nThere is limited information regarding Postmarketing Experience of Chlorpromazine (injection) in the drug label.\n\n【15】 #Drug Interactions\nThere is limited information regarding Chlorpromazine (injection) Drug Interactions in the drug label.\n\n【16】 ### Pregnancy\nPregnancy Category (FDA):\nNON-TERATOGENIC EFFECTS\nNeonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs, during the third trimester of pregnancy are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery. There have been reports of agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress and feeding disorder in these neonates. These complications have varied in severity; while in some cases symptoms have been self-limited, in other cases neonates have required intensive care unit support and prolonged hospitalization.\nChlorpromazine Hydrochloride should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\n- Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) Pregnancy Category\nThere is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Chlorpromazine (injection) in women who are pregnant.\n\n【17】 ### Labor and Delivery\nThere is no FDA guidance on use of Chlorpromazine (injection) during labor and delivery.\n\n【18】 ### Nursing Mothers\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Chlorpromazine (injection) with respect to nursing mothers.\n\n【19】 ### Pediatric Use\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Chlorpromazine (injection) with respect to pediatric patients.\n\n【20】 ### Geriatic Use\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Chlorpromazine (injection) with respect to geriatric patients.\n\n【21】 ### Gender\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Chlorpromazine (injection) with respect to specific gender populations.\n\n【22】 ### Race\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Chlorpromazine (injection) with respect to specific racial populations.\n\n【23】 ### Renal Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Chlorpromazine (injection) in patients with renal impairment.\n\n【24】 ### Hepatic Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Chlorpromazine (injection) in patients with hepatic impairment.\n\n【25】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Chlorpromazine (injection) in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n\n【26】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\nThere is no FDA guidance one the use of Chlorpromazine (injection) in patients who are immunocompromised.\n\n【27】 ### Administration\n- Intravenous\n\n【28】 ### Monitoring\nThere is limited information regarding Monitoring of Chlorpromazine (injection) in the drug label.\n\n【29】 #IV Compatibility\nThere is limited information regarding IV Compatibility of Chlorpromazine (injection) in the drug label.\n\n【30】 #Overdosage\nSymptoms\n- Primarily symptoms of central nervous system depression to the point of somnolence or coma. Hypotension and extrapyramidal symptoms.\n- Other possible manifestations include agitation and restlessness, convulsions, fever, autonomic reactions such as dry mouth and ileus, EKG changes and cardiac arrhythmias.\nTreatment\n- It is important to determine other medications taken by the patient since multiple drug therapy is common in overdosage situations. Treatment is essentially symptomatic and supportive. Early gastric lavage is helpful. Keep patient under observation and maintain an open airway, since involvement of the extrapyramidal mechanism may produce dysphagia and respiratory difficulty in severe overdosage. Do not attempt to induce emesis because a dystonic reaction of the head or neck may develop that could result in aspiration of vomitus. Extrapyramidal symptoms may be treated with anti-parkinsonism drugs, barbiturates or diphenhydramine.  prescribing information for these products. Care should be taken to avoid increasing respiratory depression.\n- If administration of a stimulant is desirable, amphetamine, dextroamphetamine or caffeine with sodium benzoate is recommended. Stimulants that may cause convulsions (e.g. picrotoxin or pentylenetetrazol) should be avoided.\n- If hypotension occurs, the standard measures for managing circulatory shock should be initiated. If it is desirable to administer a vasoconstrictor, norepinephrine and phenylephrine are most suitable. Other pressor agents, including epinephrine, are not recommended because phenothiazine derivatives may reverse the usual elevating action of these agents and cause a further lowering of blood pressure. Limited experience indicates that phenothiazines are not dialyzable.\n\n【31】 ## Mechanism of Action\nThere is limited information regarding Chlorpromazine (injection) Mechanism of Action in the drug label.\n\n【32】 ## Structure\n- Chlorpromazine HCl is chemically designated as 2-Chloro-10--phenothiazine monohydrochloride and has the following structural formula:\n- Chlorpromazine Hydrochloride Injection, USP is a sterile aqueous solution intended for deep intramuscular use.

{"seq_id": "628177b0-3ea8-4468-8207-63cb787f2097", "title": null, "text": "【0】 BACKgROuND: Neuropathic pain (NeP), redefined as pain caused by a lesion or a disease of the somatosensory system, is a disabling condition that affects approximately two million Canadians. OBjECTIVE: To review the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews related to the pharmacological management of NeP to develop a revised evidence-based consensus statement on its management. METHODS: RCTs, systematic reviews and existing guidelines on the pharmacological management of NeP were evaluated at a consensus meeting in May 2012 and updated until September 2013. Medications were recommended in the consensus statement if their analgesic efficacy was supported by at least one methodologically sound RCT (class I or class II) showing significant benefit relative to placebo or another relevant control group. Recommendations for treatment were based on the degree of evidence of analgesic efficacy, safety and ease of use. RESulTS: Analgesic agents recommended for first-line treatments are gabapentinoids (gabapentin and pregabalin), tricyclic antidepressants and serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors. Tramadol and controlledrelease opioid analgesics are recommended as second-line treatments for moderate to severe pain. Cannabinoids are now recommended as third-line treatments. Recommended fourth-line treatments include methadone, anticonvulsants with lesser evidence of efficacy (eg, lamotrigine, lacosamide), tapentadol and botulinum toxin. There is support for some analgesic combinations in selected NeP conditions. CONCluSIONS: These guidelines provide an updated, stepwise approach to the pharmacological management of NeP. Treatment should be individualized for each patient based on efficacy, side-effect profile and drug accessibility, including cost. Additional studies are required to examine head-to-head comparisons among analgesics, combinations of analgesics, long-term outcomes and treatment of pediatric, geriatric and central NeP\n\n【1】 #\nN europathic pain (NeP) has been redefined as pain caused by a lesion or a disease of the somatosensory system, and may be generated by either the peripheral or central nervous system, or both . Pain may be a manifestation of nerve injury, but there are few predictors to indicate which patients will develop this complication. For example, 50% of diabetic patients develop neuropathy during the course of their illness, but only approximately 15% report actual dysesthesias or pain . Similarly, breast surgery with transection of the intercostal brachial nerve results in NeP in up to 50% of patients . Previous prevalence estimates indicated that 2% to 3% of the population in the developed world experience NeP , le tapentadol et la toxine botulique sont recommandés en quatrième intention. Certaines polythérapies analgésiques sont acceptées pour traiter des troubles de DNe particuliers. CONCluSIONS : Ces lignes directrices fournissent une démarche mise à jour et graduelle pour la prise en charge pharmacologique de la DNe. Le traitement devrait être personnalisé en fonction de chaque patient, compte tenu de l'efficacité, du profil d'effets secondaires et de l'accessibilité du médicament, y compris son coût. D'autres études s'imposent pour faire des comparaisons directes entre analgésiques et examiner des combinaisons d'analgésiques, les résultats à long terme et le traitement de la DNe en pédiatrie, de la DNe en gériatrie et de la DNe centrale.\nIn 2007, the Canadian Pain Society (CPS) produced the first guidelines on pharmacological management of NeP tailored to the clinical practices of Canadian health professionals including analgesic agents specifically available in Canada . A consensus meeting was held in Whistler, British Columbia under the direction of the Neuropathic Pain Special Interest Group of the CPS in May 2012 to update these guidelines, given the plethora of systematic reviews and meta-analyses published since 2007 . There is also recent evidence from community-based studies that management of NeP, including postherpetic neuralgia, is not consistent with evidence-based recommendations . Funding for this consensus meeting was provided by the Neuropathic Pain Special Interest Group of the CPS. This involved a multidisciplinary group of individuals with research and clinical expertise relevant to the pathophysiology and management of NeP. This group met to review the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews related to the pharmacological management of NeP to develop a revised evidence-based consensus statement on the management of NeP . Subsequent literature was reviewed by the group until September 2013.\nSystematic searches on Medline and Cochrane databases were conducted to identify recent systematic reviews, meta-analyses and treatment recommendations, guidelines and/or consensus statements published since the first 2007 CPS consensus statement Medications could be recommended in the consensus statement if their analgesic efficacy was supported by at least one methodologically sound RCT (class I or class II) showing significant benefit relative to placebo or another relevant control group. Trials were excluded if they represented uncontrolled studies, had sample sizes of <10 patients or studied cancer NeP except for well-defined postsurgical pain syndromes (eg, postmastectomy pain syndrome) and chemotherapy-induced NeP. Trials were also excluded if they studied trigeminal or glossopharyngeal neuralgia because these conditions have their own specific medical and surgical treatments . The initial draft of the present manuscript was prepared by the first author and subsequent revisions were based on feedback from the other authors until consensus was achieved.\nThe current guidelines are based on quality of evidence of analgesic efficacy, side-effect profiles and ease of use. Medications were considered to be first line if there was high-quality evidence of efficacy (at least one class I study or two consistent class II studies -level of recommendation grade B or better) ; positive results in at least two NeP models ; and if they were considered to be straightforward and of sufficient tolerability to prescribe and monitor. Medications were considered to be second or third line if there was high-quality evidence of efficacy, but the medication required more specialized follow-up and monitoring. Fourth-line treatments had at least one positive RCT, but require further study. A limitation of this algorithmic classification is that grading of tolerability and ease of use was based solely on consensus opinion of the authors.\nTarget users for these guidelines are physicians, nurse practitioners and other allied health care individuals involved in the management of NeP. These guidelines have been endorsed by the Canadian Pain Coalition, an advocacy group for patients living with chronic pain. The published guidelines will be disseminated through various websites, including the CPS website, and reprints will be made available to undergraduate and postgraduate trainees, and practicing health care workers attending continuing medical education events. They will be updated periodically by the Neuropathic Pain Special Interest Group of the CPS.\n\n【2】 #ClINICAl CHARACTERISTICS AND DIFFERENTIAl DIAgNOSES OF NeP\nThe clinical features of NeP can be divided into spontaneous pain and stimulus-evoked pain. Spontaneous pain is commonly described as burning or intense tightness with superimposed shooting or lancinating pain. Stimulus-evoked pain includes allodynia, defined as painful sensations in response to a normally nonpainful stimulus, and hyperalgesia, defined as increased pain sensitivity in response to a normally painful stimulus. Superimposed autonomic features, such as alterations in temperature, colour and sweating as well as the development of trophic changes, suggest a diagnosis of reflex sympathetic dystrophy or complex regional pain syndrome .\nThe diagnosis of NeP is based primarily on the patient's history and physical examination. Postherpetic neuralgia and painful diabetic neuropathy are typically easy to diagnose when there is a history of shingles and diabetes mellitus, respectively. However, pain radiating into an extremity can be either referred myofascial pain or NeP, and these can be much more challenging to diagnose. Simple questionnaires based on sensory descriptors and sensory examination have been developed to differentiate between somatic pain and NeP. Instruments such as the Douleur Neuropathique 4 and the Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs have been shown to be valid and reliable discriminators of NeP .\n\n【3】 #gENERAl CONSIDERATIONS\nBecause NeP can be severe and unrelenting, it is important to recognize and treat comorbidities such as anxiety and depression. It is also important to recognize secondary treatment goals such as improving sleep, ability to function and overall quality of life. However, treatment goals must be realistic. Caregivers should validate the patient's pain to gain their trust and should set realistic treatment goals. This is typically straightforward from the caregiver's point of view because most NeP states are based on well-defined injuries to the nervous system. The primary goal in most cases is to make the pain 'bearable' or 'tolerable' -not to eliminate the pain. Such goal setting can make a considerable difference in patient satisfaction when pharmacological treatments are instituted.\nDue to the lack of head-to-head trials to guide treatment choices, one approach to estimate the relative efficacy of analgesic agents in RCTs is to use the number needed to treat (NNT) -the number of patients that need to be treated with a certain drug to provide one additional patient with at least 50% pain relief relative to the comparator group. The NNT is used to estimate treatment efficacy, recognizing that there are limitations to this methodology including variability in RCTs (eg, crossover versus parallel design) and the shortterm nature of most RCTs. Another approach to estimate efficacy is to determine the effect size -defined as the mean difference between active agent and placebo divided by the SD. The effect size can be classified as small (<0.5), medium (0.5 to <0.8) or large (≥0.8) .\nThese results were reviewed and approved by two coauthors (DEM and IG) and provide the basis for the consensus statement presented here.\n\n【4】 #FIRST-lINE ANAlgESICS\nTwo classes of medications are recommended for first-line treatment in the management of NeP -anticonvulsants and certain antidepressants.\nThe gabapentinoids, gabapentin and pregabalin, bind to presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels in the dorsal horn, reducing the release of excitatory neurotransmitters such as glutamate and substance P . These agents have been studied in large clinical trials, although mainly in the management of painful diabetic neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia. Gabapentin has shown efficacy in three trials involving painful diabetic neuropathy and two trials involving postherpetic neuralgia ; however, four RCTs involving gabapentin have been negative, including a trial of gabapentin in chemotherapyinduced painful neuropathy . The combined NNTs for gabapentin in the management of painful polyneuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia were 6.4 and 4.3, respectively .\nPregabalin is an analogue of gabapentin, with the same mechanism of action, but it manifests linear pharmacokinetics and has higher affinity for the presynaptic calcium channel. Four studies have shown that pregabalin provides significant pain relief and improved quality of life in painful diabetic neuropathy  and an additional four trials have shown efficacy in postherpetic neuralgia . The combined NNTs for pregabalin in the management of painful diabetic neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia were 4.5 and 4.2, respectively . Pregabalin has also been studied in chronic central NeP following spinal cord injury, with evidence of significant pain relief .\nCarbamazepine remains the drug of first choice for tic douloureux (idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia), but otherwise is not recommended for the management of NeP . Anecdotally, it may also be useful in the management of glossopharyngeal neuralgia .\n\n【5】 #Antidepressant agents\nThe tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) have been shown to provide significant pain relief in various NeP conditions in many clinical trials, although the sample sizes have tended to be relatively small and most of these trials have used a crossover design . The combined NNTs for TCAs in the management of painful diabetic neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia were 2.1 and 2.8, respectively .\nVenlafaxine has shown efficacy in trials involving painful diabetic neuropathy  and mixed painful polyneuropathy  at doses of 150 mg to 225 mg daily. However, the latter trial, comparing venlafaxine with imipramine, showed a higher proportion of responders in the venlafaxine group. Another trial investigating venlafaxine plus gabapentin in the management of painful diabetic neuropathy showed significant pain relief relative to placebo plus gabapentin .\n\n【6】 #SECOND-lINE ANAlgESICS\nTwo opioid-type medications are recommended for second-line treatment in the management of NeP.\nTramadol is a weak opioid agonist and mimics some of the properties of the TCAs in that it inhibits reuptake of noradrenalin and serotonin . Tramadol has shown significant benefit in three RCTs investigating painful diabetic neuropathy and mixed NeP syndromes, and has an overall NNT of 4.9 . Tramadol leads to less constipation and nausea than other weak opioid analgesics, such as codeine , but is more expensive in Canada. Tramadol should be used with caution in conjunction with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) because of increased risk of confusion and serotonin syndrome, especially among elderly patients .\n\n【7】 #Opioid analgesics\nA recent meta-analysis of opioids for chronic noncancer pain included 16 randomized trials for chronic NeP . Most of these trials investigated painful diabetic neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia; however, other trials focused on postamputation pain, sciatica and spinal cord injury pain. The authors found that opioids were more effective than placebo, with a moderate effect size (0.56) for pain. There was a small effect size (0.24) in favour of opioids for function in 13 of these RCTs. The combined NNT for opioids in the management of painful polyneuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia was 2.6 .\n\n【8】 #THIRD-lINE ANAlgESICS\nOne class of medication is recommended for third-line treatment in the management of NeP -cannabinoids.\nThe cannabinoids are analgesic agents with increasing evidence of efficacy in central NeP states, with a combined NNT of 3.4 . Dronabinol produced modest analgesia in a trial investigating central pain in multiple sclerosis . A 50/50 mixture of tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol in the form of an oral mucosal spray provided significant benefit in another trial investigating central pain in multiple sclerosis . A recent systematic review of clinical trials investigating cannabinoids in chronic pain determined that, since 2006, there have been seven highquality (class I and II) studies investigating NeP, and all of these studies except one were positive . Four of these studies involved smoked cannabis for the management of HIV neuropathy (two studies), posttraumatic or postsurgical NeP, and combined central and peripheral NeP states. Two trials involved the cannabinoid oral mucosal spray in the management of multiple peripheral NeP states with allodynia and painful diabetic neuropathy. The single negative trial compared the synthetic cannabinoid nabilone with dihydrocodeine in peripheral NeP conditions, and found that dihydrocodeine was superior to nabilone. A more recent trial found that nabilone was effective in relieving symptoms of painful diabetic neuropathy, and also improved disturbed sleep and overall quality of life using an enriched enrollment withdrawal design .\n\n【9】 #FOuRTH-lINE ANAlgESICS\nSeveral classes of medications can be considered to be fourth-line treatments for NeP -SSRIs, other anticonvulsants, methadone, topical lidocaine and miscellaneous agents.\nSSRIs appear to have a weak analgesic effect in the management of NeP. Citalopram , paroxetine  and escitalopram  have been found to be efficacious in the management of painful diabetic neuropathy and painful polyneuropathy independent of their antidepressant effects, but fluoxetine has not . However, the combined NNT for all four studies was 6.8 . SSRIs used primarily for depression may inhibit the metabolism of TCAs and may increase the risk for serotonin syndrome .\n\n【10】 #Other anticonvulsants\nLamotrigine has been studied in a variety of peripheral and central NeP conditions, with variable results. Four studies investigating painful diabetic neuropathy, two studies investigating mixed NeP and single studies investigating chemotherapy-induced NeP and spinal cord injury pain were negative. Positive trials investigating HIV-related neuropathy, trigeminal neuralgia and central poststroke pain were reported; however, the sample sizes tended to be small, with significant dropout rates .\nLacosamide is an anticonvulsant agent with sodium channelblocking properties. Lacosamide has been studied in five RCTs investigating painful diabetic neuropathy. There was modest benefit in each trial, with an NNT in the range of 10 to 12. Lacosamide, therefore, has limited efficacy in the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy .\nTopiramate and valproic acid have produced mixed results in NeP trials .\nMethadone is a synthetic opioid analgesic that may be useful in the management of NeP related to its N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist properties . Two small RCTs demonstrated benefit from methadone in chronic NeP . An RCT comparing methadone with other oral opioids is urgently needed.\n\n【11】 #Topical lidocaine\nTopical lidocaine, as a sodium channel blocker, may be useful in the management of NeP. Systemic side effects are extremely rare as a result of negligible blood levels . Topical lidocaine is most practical for patients with localized peripheral NeP, such as postherpetic neuralgia, and remains a second-line agent for this condition based on three positive RCTs investigating lidocaine patch 5% in the management of postherpetic neuralgia . However, recent trials of lidocaine cream or patch 5% failed to provide benefit in patients with postsurgical peripheral nerve injury  or in mixed NeP . Therefore, there are conflicting results among placebo-controlled trials investigating topical lidocaine for NeP.\n\n【12】 #Miscellaneous agents\nTapentadol is a novel analgesic that has recently become available in Canada. It is pharmacologically similar to tramadol in that it has a dual mechanism of action, but has higher affinity for the mu opioid receptor and has only noradrenergic activity as a monoamine reuptake inhibitor. Tapentadol is approximately one-fifth as potent as oxycodone and has shown efficacy in the management of painful diabetic neuropathy, with greater tolerability .\nTopical capsaicin may have utility in the management of localized NeP such as postherpetic neuralgia. Following application to the skin, capsaicin initially causes enhanced sensitivity of nociceptors, followed by persistent desensitization after repeated application of low-concentration (<1%) capsaicin or a single application of highconcentration (8%) capsaicin. Several older studies involving small sample sizes indicate that low-concentration capsaicin provides minimal benefit relative to placebo creams . On the other hand, high-concentration capsaicin has recently been studied in four trials investigating postherpetic neuralgia and two trials investigating painful HIV neuropathy using 0.04% topical capsaicin as the control to maintain blinding. All of these studies showed significant benefit relative to the control for up to 12 weeks after a single application. The NNT for the postherpetic neuralgia studies was in the range of eight to 10 and, for the HIV-neuropathy studies, was approximately 6.2 . High-concentration capsaicin requires preapplication of local anesthetic because of the intense burning sensation it produces. This agent is quite expensive and only available in Canada through compassionate release from Health Canada.\nBotulinum toxin has been studied in two RCTs involving NeP. Both studies were positive, with significant reduction in pain intensity for 12 to 14 weeks, but these studies were likely underpowered due to small sample sizes. A crossover trial involving patients with painful diabetic neuropathy included only 18 patients  and a parallel design trial involving patients with focal painful neuropathies included only 29 patients . Evidence for the role of botulinum toxin in the management of NeP, therefore, remains preliminary.\n\n【13】 #Combination pharmacotherapy\nCombining ≥2 analgesic agents in the management of NeP is an attractive option because combination pharmacotherapy may improve analgesic efficacy and has the potential to reduce the overall side effect profile if synergistic effects allow for dose reductions of combined drugs . A recent Cochrane review of combination pharmacotherapy for the treatment of NeP in adults identified 21 eligible studies . The majority of these studies evaluated the combination of an opioid with gabapentin, pregabalin or a TCA, the combination of gabapentin and nortriptyline, and various topical medications. Meta-analysis was possible for only one combination -gabapentin plus opioid versus gabapentin alone. The meta-analysis demonstrated modest superiority of gabapentin plus opioid versus gabapentin alone, although the combination produced significantly more dropouts due to accentuated side effects related to combination treatments. A recent RCT comparing a combination of standard doses of duloxetine (60 mg daily) and pregabalin (300 mg daily) with high-dose monotherapy (duloxetine 120mg daily or pregabalin 600 mg daily) found no significant difference in 24 h average pain, although side effects were comparable . Available studies do not support a recommendation of any one specific drug combination for NeP, although these studies do provide a rationale for combination pharmacotherapy.\n\n【14】 #STEPWISE PHARMACOlOgICAl MANAgEMENT OF NeP\nNonpharmacological interventions, including physiotherapy, exercise programs and psychological treatment modalities, are essential to enhance outcome. Relative to the previous guidelines for management of NeP published in 2007 , duloxetine has been upgraded from a second-line to a first-line agent based on recent evidence of efficacy in the management of chemotherapy-induced painful neuropathy  in addition to previously established efficacy in painful diabetic neuropathy.\nTCAs, gabapentinoids and SNRIs are, therefore, now all considered to be first-line agents in the management of chronic NeP. TCAs have the advantage of low cost and once-daily dosing, but can produce drowsiness and significant anticholinergic side effects, including dry mouth, constipation and urinary retention, and are, thus, poorly tolerated in the elderly. Secondary amine TCAs (nortriptyline and desipramine) are better tolerated than tertiary amine TCAs (amitriptyline and imipramine) with comparable analgesic efficacy . Cardiac toxicity is also a risk factor with TCAs, which are relatively contraindicated in patients with a history of arrhythmia .\nGabapentin and pregabalin appear to be similar in their mechanisms of action and side-effect profiles, and allow for more rapid titration than antidepressant agents. Pregabalin carries the advantage of twice-daily dosing and linear pharmacokinetics relative to gabapentin. Gabapentinoids in general have few drug interactions, but are dependent on renal excretion and, therefore, require dosage reductions in patients with renal insufficiency .\nIf a TCA fails or is contraindicated, the use of a gabapentinoid or an SNRI, such as duloxetine, should be considered. If one of the latter agents provides only partial pain relief, it is reasonable to add the other agent because there is evidence that combination pharmacotherapy can be helpful .\nWhen first-line medications fail or provide inadequate pain relief, tramadol or a conventional opioid analgesic may be useful as a secondline treatment. It is also reasonable to consider a short-acting opioid, such as codeine or oxycodone (sometimes combined with acetaminophen), for breakthrough pain during titration of a first-line agent if needed for severe pain. Controlled-release opioid analgesics are considered to be second-line agents in the management of NeP because of their extensive side-effect profile and the risk of opioid misuse, abuse and addiction leading to cautionary prescribing and monitoring. A recent meta-analysis of 62 RCTs found that the most common adverse effects associated with opioids were nausea (28%), constipation (25%), drowsiness (24%), dizziness (18%) and vomiting (15%) . Although tolerance may occur to several of these side effects, there is very little tolerance to constipation and almost all patients placed on a controlledrelease opioid analgesic require a bowel regimen with continued monitoring of bowel function. Potential long-term complications of opioid analgesia include opioid-induced hyperalgesia  and opioid-induced endocrinopathy .\nThe cannabinoids have now advanced to third-line agents in the management of chronic NeP based on increasing evidence of efficacy in multiple pain models including HIV neuropathy, post-traumatic and postsurgical NeP, painful diabetic neuropathy and spinal cord injury pain . However, the cannabinoids also require close monitoring, are contraindicated in patients with a history of psychosis and most of these agents, including the oral mucosal spray, are expensive.\nFourth-line agents in the management of NeP include methadone, tapentadol and anticonvulsants, with lesser evidence of efficacy such as lacosamide, lamotrigine and topiramate. Topical lidocaine has been relegated to fourth-line status because of conflicting evidence of efficacy except in the management of postherpetic neuralgia, for which it remains a second-line option.\nIt is more challenging to provide a stepwise systematic approach to the management of central NeP because of the relative paucity of highquality studies and conflicting evidence of efficacy. For instance, lamotrigine was found to be useful in the management of central poststroke pain, but not for spinal cord injury pain . Similarly, pregabalin has been found to be efficacious in the management of spinal cord injury pain  in the management of central poststroke pain.\n\n【15】 #INVASIVE TECHNIQuES IN THE MANAgEMENT OF NeP\nAlthough interventional techniques for NeP management are beyond the scope of the present consensus statement, they are usually considered when standard pharmacological treatments fail and psychological screening shows emotional stability. Intravenous lidocaine infusions are generally safe, but evidence of efficacy is limited to one to two weeks postinfusion . Two recent comprehensive reviews of interventional management of NeP concluded that weak recommendations could be made for epidural steroid injections for radiculopathy, and spinal cord stimulation for failed back surgery syndrome and complex regional pain syndrome type 1 .\nThe present updated consensus statement provides a stepwise pharmacological approach to the management of NeP. Gabapentinoids, TCAs and SNRIs represent first-line treatments for NeP either individually or in combination. When these agents fail, conventional opioid analgesics and tramadol provide important avenues of treatment, bearing in mind their associated risks and adverse effect profiles. Cannabinoids are now considered to be third-line agents based on recent evidence of efficacy, but also require judicious prescribing practices. Novel treatment approaches are required to improve our management of NeP and further studies are necessary to examine head-to-head comparisons among analgesics, combinations of analgesics, long-term outcomes and treatments of pediatric, geriatric and central NeP.\nThe consensus meeting and manuscript preparation for this consensus statement were conducted under the direction of the Neuropathic Pain Special Interest Group of the CPS. Funding for this project was provided by this group.\n\n【16】 #APPENDIx A: SYSTEMATIC lITERATuRE SEARCH RESulTS\nResults from Medline and Cochrane databases for pharmacological management of neuropathic pain using TITLE terms 'systematic reviews', 'meta-analyses' and 'guideline  statement  recommendation  consensus' (English language literature since 2007) were tabulated.

It has a complicated function that is only partly understood. The LYK5 gene product is part of a chemical “relay” or “messaging” system that controls the growth and function of many cells in the body.\nIn Pretzel syndrome, part of the LYK5 gene is missing, which leads to a complete loss of this signaling function. The LYK5 gene has an important role in normal organ development. Defective organ development that begins during the earliest stages of pregnancy is not treatable and leads to a variety of medical problems throughout life.\n\n【4】 ## Symptoms\n- In affected children studied, the first signs of Pretzel syndrome began during gestation: 80% of mothers had polyhydramnios, extra amniotic fluid around the affected baby.\n- All mothers also had preterm labor starting anywhere from 25-38 weeks gestation. The brain was large and malformed in all affected children.\n- The nerve cells were not positioned properly and probably did not make normal connections with other nerve cells. As a result,seizures began early in life and were often difficult to treat.\n- Mental development was severely delayed.\n\n【5】 ### Eyes\n- Like other muscles of the body, those that controlled the eyes were also weak, and about 40% of affected children had strabismus or “lazy eye.”\n\n【6】 ### Heart\nAnatomical defect in heart typically does not cause symptoms of heart failure early in life, but can become problematic later in childhood.\n\n【7】 ### Extremities\n- The muscles were thin and weaker than normal.\n\n【8】 ## MRI\n- MRI studies showed extra fluid around the brain, or “hydrocephalus.”\n\n【9】 #Treatment\nAlthough the organ defects caused by LYK5 deficiency can not be prevented or reversed, Pretzel syndrome can nonetheless be treated by recognizing problems such as seizures, strabismus, diabetes insipidus, and heart defects, and treating these problems appropriately to optimize the health and well-being of the child.\n- Children with strabismus should be treated by a pediatric eye doctor to prevent permanent loss of vision.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

These drugs are generally administered by an anesthesia provider in order to induce or maintain general anaesthesia to facilitate surgery.\nDrugs given to induce or maintain general anaesthesia are either given as:\n- Gases or vapors (inhalational anaesthetics)\n- Injections (intravenous anaesthetics)\nMost commonly these two forms are combined, with an injection given to induce anaesthesia and a gas used to maintain it, although it is possible to deliver anaesthesia solely by inhalation or injection.\nInhalational anaesthetic substances are either volatile liquids or gases and are usually delivered using an anaesthesia machine. An anaesthesia machine allows composing a mixture of oxygen, anaesthetics and ambient air, delivering it to the patient and monitoring patient and machine parameters. Liquid anaesthetics are vaporized in the machine.\nMany compounds have been used for inhalation anaesthesia, but only a few are still in widespread use. Desflurane, isoflurane and sevoflurane are the most widely used volatile anaesthetics today.  They are often combined with nitrous oxide. Older, less popular, volatile anesthetics, include halothane, enflurane, and methoxyflurane. Researchers are also actively exploring the use of xenon as an anaesthetic.\nInjection anaesthetics are used for induction and maintenance of a state of unconsciousness, Among the most widely used drugs are:\n- Propofol\n- Etomidate\n- Barbiturates such as methohexital and thiopentone/thiopental\n- Benzodiazepines such as midazolam and diazepam (commonly known as Valium)\n- Ketamine is used in the UK as \"field anaesthesia\", for instance at a road traffic incident, and is more frequently used in the operative setting in the US.\nThe volatile anaesthetics are a class of general anaesthetic drugs. They share the property of being liquid at room temperature, but evaporating easily for administration by inhalation (some experts make a distinction between volatile and gas anesthetics on this basis, but both are treated in this article, since they probably do not differ in mechanm of action). All of these agents share the property of being quite hydrophobic ,i.e. as liquids, they are not freely miscible with in water, and as gases they dissolve in oils better than in water\nPediatric Anaesthesia:\nAnatomic and physiologic differences among neonates, children and adults require differences in the administration of anesthesia compared to adults.\nPreoperative Preparation:\nFasting: Infants and children have a higher metabolic rate and a larger body surface area:weight than adults. As such they become dehydrated more easily than adults.  Studies have found not difference in gastric residual volume and pH in children permitted unlimited clear liquids 2 to 3 hours prior to anesthesia induction.\nCurrent guidelines American Association of Anesthesiologists:\nIngested Material Minimum Fasting Period\nClear liquids 2 h\nBreast milk 4 h\nInfant formula 6 h\nNonhuman milk 6 h\nLight meal 6 h\nPremedication: Premedication is not often necessary for children 6 months and younger. Premedication is often used in the extremely fearful child or 10-12 month olds as this is the peak time a child has severe separation anxiety from parents. Oral midazolam is most commonly used .25-.33 mg/Kg in the US. Premedications may be administered orally, intravenously, intramuscularly, nasally, rectally and sublingually. Premedication combination is often midazolam, Ketamine, and atropine.\nExcept for atropine, anticholinergics are not commonly used in infants and children as they often do not reduce laryngeal reflexes during anesthesia induction. Atropine in infants less than 6 months of age less than 45 minutes before induction reduces hypotension during in induction with inhaled anesthetics.\nInduction of Anesthesia:", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

For the history of the Pyrosequencing method see Methods Mol Biol. 2007. Pyrosequencing AB was started to commercialize the machine and reagent for sequencing of short stretches of  DNA. Pyrosequencing AB was renamed to Biotage in 2003. Pyrosequencing technology was further licensed to 454 Life Sciences. 454 developed an array-based Pyrosequencing which has emerged as a rapid platform for large-scale DNA sequencing. Most notably, are the applications for genome sequencing and metagenomics. Latest platform of Pyrosequencing (GS FLX from 454 Life Sciences which is owned by Roche) can generate 100 million nucleotide data in a 7 hour run with a single machine. It is anticipated that the throughput would increase by 5-10 fold with the next release. Each run would cost about 8 to 9 thousand USD, thereby, de novo sequencing of mammalian genomes are in million dollar range.\n\n【1】 #Procedure\nThe method is based on a chemical light-producing enzymatic reaction, which is triggered when a molecular recognition event occurs. Essentially, the method allows sequencing of a single strand of DNA by synthesizing the complementary strand along it.  Each time a nucleotide, A, C, G or T is incorporated into the growing chain a cascade of enzymatic reactions is triggered which causes a light signal.\nssDNA template is hybridized to a sequencing primer and incubated with the enzymes DNA polymerase, ATP sulfurylase, luciferase and apyrase, and with the substrates adenosine 5´ phosphosulfate (APS) and luciferin.\n- The addition of one of the four deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs) initiates the second step. DNA polymerase incorporates the correct, complementary dNTPs onto the template. This incorporation releases pyrophosphate (PPi) stoichiometrically.\n- ATP sulfurylase quantitatively converts PPi to ATP in the presence of adenosine 5´ phosphosulfate. This ATP acts as fuel to the luciferase-mediated conversion of luciferin to oxyluciferin that generates visible light in amounts that are proportional to the amount of ATP. The light produced in the luciferase-catalyzed reaction is detected by a charge coupled device (CCD) camera and this can be analyzed in a program. Each light signal is proportional to the number of nucleotides incorporated.\n- Unincorporated nucleotides and ATP are degraded by the apyrase, and the reaction can restart with another nucleotide.\nCurrently, a limitation of the method is that the lengths of individual reads of DNA sequence are in the neighborhood of 300-500 nucleotides, shorter than the 800-1000 obtainable with chain termination methods (e.g. Sanger sequencing).  This can make the process of genome assembly more difficult, particularly for sequence containing a large amount of repetitive DNA.  As of 2007, pyrosequencing is most commonly used for resequencing or sequencing of genomes for which the sequence of a close relative is already available.\nThe templates for pyrosequencing can be made both by solid phase template preparation (Streptavidin coated magnetic beads) and enzymatic template preparation (Apyrase+Exonuclease).\n\n【2】 #Recent advances\nThe technique has been commercialized and further developed by 454 Life Sciences Corporation in its GS 20 and GS FLX line of sequencing machines.\n\n【3】 ## Bee Virus\nIn September 2007, 454 pyrosequencing was used in a study implicating Israel acute paralysis virus in honeybee Colony Collapse Disorder .", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

The future discontinuation of CFC-containing inhaler devices will affect the range of devices available but does not affect the guidance.\nFor children under the age of 12 years with chronic asthma in whom treatment with an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) is considered appropriate, the least costly product that is suitable for an individual child (taking into consideration technology appraisal guidance 38 and 10), within its marketing authorisation, is recommended.\nThe use of a combination device within its marketing authorisation is recommended as an option.\nThe decision to use a combination device or the two agents in separate devices should be made on an individual basis, taking into consideration therapeutic need and the likelihood of treatment adherence.\nIf a combination device is chosen then the least costly device that is suitable for the individual child is recommended\n\n【3】 #Clinical need and practice\nAsthma is a chronic condition that causes symptoms such as shortness of breath (dyspnoea), chest tightness, wheezing, sputum production and cough associated with variable airflow obstruction and airway hyper-responsiveness. There are approximately 5.2 million people with asthma in the UK, nearly 1 million of whom are children. Asthma is the most common chronic disease in children, with a prevalence of between 17% and 23%.\nDiagnosing asthma in children requires excluding other causes of recurrent respiratory symptoms. Persistent respiratory symptoms between acute respiratory attacks are suggestive of asthma, and a personal or family history of atopic conditions such as eczema or hayfever are also linked to asthma. If it is possible to perform lung function tests, bronchodilator responsiveness, peak expiratory flow (PEF) variability and bronchial hyper-reactivity testing may be used to confirm the diagnosis. In addition, allergy testing may be helpful in seeking causal factors.\nAlthough mortality as a result of asthma is rare (38 deaths in children younger than 14 years were reported in the UK in 2004), the condition can have a significant impact on quality of life. One study in Australia suggested that one in five children with asthma did not ride a bike, play at school or play with animals, and one in three did not participate in organised sports. Other effects of asthma can include school absence and night disturbances.\nThe aim of asthma management is to control the symptoms, prevent exacerbations and – in school-aged children – to achieve the best possible lung function. Pharmacological management includes drugs such as inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs), and short- and long-acting beta-2 agonists (SABAs/LABAs). The latter should be used only in combination with an ICS. A large proportion of children with asthma are managed in primary care, often within nurse-led clinics. Community pharmacists may also play a role in educating children and their carers. General practitioners are encouraged to perform annual reviews on all registered people with asthma as part of the new General Medical Services contract and the Quality and Outcomes Framework in England.\nCurrent British guidelines from the British Thoracic Society (BTS) and Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) for the management of asthma recommend a stepwise approach to treatment in both adults and children. Treatment is started at the step most appropriate to the initial severity of the asthma, with the aim of achieving early control of symptoms and optimising respiratory function. Control is maintained by stepping up treatment as necessary and stepping down when control is good.\nMild intermittent asthma (step 1) is treated with inhaled SABAs, as required. The introduction of regular preventer therapy with ICSs (step 2) should be considered when a child has had exacerbations of asthma in the previous 2 years, is using inhaled SABAs three times a week or more, is symptomatic three times a week or more, or is waking at night once a week because of asthma. In children who cannot take an ICS, a leukotriene receptor antagonist is recommended.\nAt step 4, further interventions may be considered if control remains inadequate. For children aged 5–12 years this may include increasing the daily dose of ICS to the equivalent of 800 micrograms of beclometasone dipropionate, or adding leukotriene receptor antagonists or theophyllines. For children younger than 5 years, step 4 is referral to a respiratory paediatrician (if not already from step 3). At step 5 (for children aged 5–12 years only), continuous or frequent courses of oral corticosteroids are introduced. Before proceeding to this step, referral to a respiratory paediatrician should be considered. The majority of children with asthma are treated at steps 1, 2 or 3, with approximately 10% treated at either step 4 or 5.\nTwo important components of asthma management are maintaining adherence to medication and optimising inhaler technique. Studies of adults have suggested that the recommended doses of medication may only be taken on 20% to 73% of days, with average adherence (measured by the ratio of doses taken to doses prescribed) ranging from 63% to 92%. Records from the General Practice Research Database found that, over a 10-year period, only 42% of people obtained a repeat prescription for ICSs within the expected timeframe of the preceding prescription. With regard to inhaler technique, the ability to use an inhaler correctly is important for ensuring the delivery of the desired dose of a drug to the correct part of the lungs. Studies have reported that physicians assess inhaler technique as 'good' in 5–86% of adults. In children, this may be an even greater problem, with repeated education needed to make sure adequate technique is maintained.\nNICE guidance on asthma devices for children aged 5–15 years (NICE technology appraisal guidance 38) recommends that ICSs are delivered using a press-and-breathe pressurised metered-dose inhaler (pMDI) with an appropriate spacer device. However, if a healthcare professional believes a child will be unable to use a press-and-breathe inhaler, other devices should be considered. The guidance also recommends that the child's therapeutic need and their ability and willingness to use a particular inhaler should be taken into account when choosing an inhaler. Guidance for children younger than 5 years (NICE technology appraisal guidance 10) also recommends the use of a pMDI and spacer device, with a face mask if necessary. Again, the choice of a device should take into account the needs of the child and the likelihood of good compliance.\nICSs suppress inflammation in the lungs and are recommended for prophylactic treatment of asthma. In the UK, three ICSs are licensed for use in children: beclometasone dipropionate, budesonide and fluticasone propionate. ICSs are available in both pMDIs and dry powder inhalers (DPIs). pMDIs can either be press-and-breathe or breath actuated, but both contain the drug as either a suspension in a carrier liquid or a solution delivered using a chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) or hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) propellant. It is expected that those using CFC propellants will be phased out in line with the Montreal Protocol. Press-and-breathe pMDIs can be used with spacer devices that enable the drug to be inhaled by breathing normally, thereby removing some of the difficulties with coordinating pressing and inhaling. Spacers also reduce oral deposition of the drug, so they may reduce the likelihood of local adverse effects of corticosteroids such as oral candidiasis. DPIs require less coordination to use, but they require a high flow rate of air through the device to ensure that the drug reaches the lungs.\nBeclometasone dipropionate is licensed for use in children in 10 different products. Three of these products are press-and-breathe pMDIs using a CFC propellant (Beclazone, IVAX Pharmaceuticals; Becotide, GlaxoSmithKline ; Filair, 3M Health Care), one of the products is a press-and-breathe pMDI using a HFA propellant (Clenil Modulite, Trinity Chiesi), two products are breath-actuated pMDIs (Aerobec Autohaler, 3M Health Care; Beclazone Easi Breathe, IVAX Pharmaceuticals), and four products are DPIs (Asmabec Clickhaler, UCB; Becodisks Diskhaler, GlaxoSmithKline; Cyclocaps, TEVA; Pulvinal, Trinity Chiesi). The marketing authorisation for beclometasone dipropionate differs depending on the product in which it is available and, within a particular product, not all dose strengths available are recommended for children. The maximum licensed dosage is 400 micrograms per day with no specified lower age limit. Pulvinal and Asmabec are not licensed for children younger than 6 years.\nBudesonide is licensed for use in children in five different products. Two of these products are press-and-breathe pMDIs using a CFC propellant (Pulmicort inhaler, AstraZeneca; Pulmicort LS, AstraZeneca) and three of these products are DPIs (Easyhaler, Ranbaxy; Novolizer, Meda Pharmaceuticals; Pulmicort Turbohaler, AstraZeneca). The marketing authorisation for budesonide differs depending on the product in which it is available and, within a particular product, not all dose strengths available are recommended for children. The maximum licensed dosage is 800 micrograms per day. No lower age limit is specified in the marketing authorisation for the three Pulmicort devices, while the lower age limit for the other two products is 6 years.\nFluticasone propionate is licensed for children in three different products. One of these products is a press-and-breathe pMDI using a HFA propellant (Flixotide Evohaler, GlaxoSmithKline) and two of these products are DPIs (Flixotide Accuhaler, GlaxoSmithKline; Flixotide Diskhaler, GlaxoSmithKline). The marketing authorisation for fluticasone propionate differs depending on the product in which it is available and, within a particular product, not all dose strengths available are recommended for children. The maximum licensed dosage is 400 micrograms per day and none of the products is licensed for the treatment of children younger than 4 years. Fluticasone propionate is considered nominally clinically equivalent to beclometasone dipropionate and budesonide at half the dose (that is, a ratio of 1:2).\nThe Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer and The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer  The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. Kenya: United Nations Environment Programme\n\n【4】 #Evidence and interpretation\n\n【5】 #Clinical effectiveness\nSubmissions were received from four manufacturers. The submissions from Meda Pharmaceuticals and Trinity Chiesi both compared their products with other products delivering the same drug. Such studies were excluded from the systematic review carried out by the Assessment Group because they were outside the scope of the appraisal. The submissions from GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca also focused on their own products but compared these with other available ICSs. However, in both of these submissions, the inclusion criteria differed from those of the Assessment Group, with the result that some of the studies included in the assessment report were excluded from the manufacturers' submissions and vice versa.\nThe Assessment Group identified evidence on the use of ICSs in six scenarios.\nICSs were compared with each other at low dose (defined as 200–400 micrograms beclometasone dipropionate or equivalent).\nIncreasing the dose of ICS was compared with adding a LABA to the initial dose using a combination device.\nRemaining on the same dose of ICS was compared with adding a LABA using a combination device.\nICS/LABA combination devices were compared with the same drugs delivered in separate devices.\nDifferent ICS/LABA combination devices were compared with each other.\n\n【6】 ## Comparisons of low-dose corticosteroids\nThe Assessment Group identified five randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in children that compared ICSs at low doses (200–400 micrograms beclometasone dipropionate or equivalent); one compared beclometasone dipropionate with budesonide, two compared fluticasone propionate with budesonide, and two compared fluticasone propionate with beclometasone dipropionate. The primary aim of three of the studies was to look at differences in adverse effects between the treatments; one of the studies was powered to detect differences in lung function; and one examined whether the two corticosteroids could be considered equipotent.\nReporting of the study data was incomplete in some studies and inconsistent across the different studies. Because of the differences between the studies, they could not be meta-analysed. None of the studies reported any statistically significant differences between treatments in the outcome measures of lung function, symptoms, use of rescue medication, exacerbations and adverse events. Other RCTs were identified in consultees' submissions but were excluded from the Assessments Group's systematic review. In general, these studies supported the conclusions of the studies included in the assessment report, although three studies were identified in the submission from GlaxoSmithKline that suggested a statistically significant difference favouring the use of fluticasone propionate for growth outcomes when compared with budesonide and beclometasone dipropionate. However, this difference was not demonstrated in the low-dose studies included in the assessment report.\n\n【7】 ## Comparisons of high-dose corticosteroids\nThe Assessment Group identified five RCTs in children that compared nominally clinically equivalent doses of ICSs when given at high doses (greater than 400 micrograms beclometasone dipropionate or equivalent); one compared beclometasone dipropionate with budesonide, two compared fluticasone propionate with beclometasone dipropionate, and two compared fluticasone propionate with budesonide. The primary aims were to examine differences in adverse effects (one study) and to examine differences in lung function (three studies). In the fifth study, the primary aim was not reported. The studies were not meta-analysed because they were not considered comparable. In a number of these studies, the doses of ICSs were above the licensed doses for children.\nOne study identified a statistically significant difference in morning peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) favouring fluticasone propionate compared with budesonide; two studies identified a statistically significant difference in growth rates favouring fluticasone propionate compared with budesonide; and one study identified a statistically significant difference in cortisol excretion favouring budesonide when compared with beclometasone dipropionate. No further statistically significant differences between ICSs were identified for measures of lung function, symptoms, use of rescue medication, exacerbations or adverse effects.\n\n【8】 ## Comparisons of ICS/LABA and higher dose ICS\nOne RCT was included in the assessment report that compared budesonide/formoterol fumarate 80/4.5 micrograms daily plus SABA, as required, with higher dose budesonide 320 micrograms daily plus SABA, as required. The primary outcome for this study was time to first severe exacerbation. Of the study participants, 12% (n = 341) were children aged 4–11 years for whom only growth and plasma cortisol outcomes were reported separately from the adult participants. For the population as a whole, no statistically significant differences were reported for the primary study outcome. However, the study identified statistically significant higher growth rates in children receiving budesonide/formoterol fumarate.\nNo further studies that compared budesonide/formoterol fumarate in a combination device with a higher dose of budesonide alone were identified in consultees' submissions. One unpublished RCT was included in the submission from GlaxoSmithKline, which compared fluticasone propionate/salmeterol (as xinafoate) 200/100 micrograms per day with fluticasone propionate 400 micrograms per day. The primary outcome of this study was the combined percentage of symptom-free days and nights. No statistically significant differences between treatments were identified for measures of lung function, symptoms, use of rescue medication, exacerbations or adverse effects.\n\n【9】 ## Comparisons of ICS/LABA and same-dose ICS\nThe assessment report identified two RCTs that compared the use of ICS and LABA treatment in a combination device with continuing the same dose of ICS alone. The clinical relevance of this situation is limited, because a person whose asthma is not controlled on an ICS alone would either have the dose increased or a LABA added.\nOne study compared fluticasone propionate/salmeterol 200/100 micrograms per day with fluticasone propionate 200 micrograms per day. The primary aim of this study was to compare the safety profiles of the two treatments. The second study compared budesonide/formoterol fumarate 400/18 micrograms per day with budesonide 400 micrograms per day. The primary outcome of this study was morning and evening PEFR. The studies were not meta-analysed because they were not comparable. The study comparing fluticasone propionate/salmeterol with fluticasone propionate reported safety outcomes, however it stated that the group of participants receiving the fluticasone propionate/salmeterol combination showed greater improvements in lung function and fewer exacerbations than the group receiving fluticasone propionate alone (no significance tests were reported). The study of budesonide/formoterol fumarate identified a statistically significant difference across measures of lung function (forced expiratory volume , morning and evening PEFR) favouring the use of budesonide/formoterol fumarate over budesonide alone. No other statistically significant differences were identified for lung function, symptoms, use of rescue medication and adverse effects. Exacerbation rates were not reported in the published paper.\nTwo further studies were included in manufacturers' submissions, but these were excluded from the review by the Assessment Group. The first compared fluticasone propionate 200 micrograms per day with fluticasone propionate/salmeterol 200/100 micrograms per day. This study identified no statistically significant differences for lung function, symptoms, use of rescue medication and adverse effects. A second study compared budesonide 400 micrograms per day with budesonide/formoterol fumarate 400/18 micrograms per day. This study identified a statistically significant difference favouring the budesonide/formoterol fumarate group for lung function outcomes, but not for other measures of symptoms, use of rescue medication or adverse events. Exacerbation rates were not reported in the published paper.\n\n【10】 ## Comparisons of ICS/LABA administered in separate or combination devices\nOne RCT was included in the assessment report that compared fluticasone propionate/salmeterol 200/100 micrograms per day delivered using either a combination device or two separate devices. The aim of the study was to compare the safety and efficacy of the two methods of delivery. No statistically significant differences were identified for outcomes in lung function, symptoms, use of rescue medication and adverse effects. Exacerbation rates were not reported.\nA second RCT was included in the AstraZeneca submission, but it was published after the cut-off date for inclusion in the assessment report. This study compared budesonide/formoterol fumarate delivered using either a combination device or separate devices. The primary outcome for the study was morning PEFR. The study identified no statistically significant differences in lung function, symptoms, use of rescue medication or adverse effects. Exacerbation rates were not reported in the published paper. Because these studies used a double-blind double-dummy design – the patients taking a combination device also received a placebo dummy – they may not capture the benefits of improved treatment adherence with a combination device.\n\n【11】 ## Comparisons of budesonide/formoterol fumarate and fluticasone propionate/salmeterol combination devices\nNo RCTs were identified in either the assessment report or in consultees' submissions that compared budesonide/formoterol fumarate with fluticasone propionate/salmeterol.\n\n【12】 #Cost effectiveness\nSubmissions were received from four manufacturers and each was specific to the manufacturer's product(s). The submissions from Trinity Chiesi and Meda Pharmaceuticals specifically compared their products with devices containing the same drug, whereas the submissions from AstraZeneca and GlaxoSmithKline compared their products with different ICSs. All submissions included some analyses that assumed equal efficacy between drugs and products and compared the costs of different products. Two of the submissions also included cost–utility analyses (AstraZeneca and GlaxoSmithKline). The Assessment Group did not model the cost–utility of ICSs because of incomplete trial evidence; it carried out cost-comparison analyses if it was considered appropriate to assume equal efficacy between the drugs, and it otherwise conducted exploratory cost-offset analyses.\nNeither the Assessment Group nor consultees identified any existing published cost-effectiveness studies with the relevant comparator for the population of children younger than 12 years with chronic asthma.\n\n【13】 ## AstraZeneca submission\nThe submission from AstraZeneca included analyses to support the use of the AstraZeneca products Pulmicort (budesonide delivered by either a pMDI or a DPI) and Symbicort (budesonide/formoterol fumarate delivered by a DPI). The cost–utility of Symbicort was modelled firstly as a comparison between fixed dose and adjusted maintenance dosing. Secondly, Symbicort fixed dose was modelled in comparison with remaining on the same dose of ICS alone or adding a LABA, and thirdly in comparison with providing an ICS and a LABA in separate devices. Cost–utility analyses were not carried out comparing the different ICSs or comparing Seretide and Symbicort. Instead, analyses of costs assuming equal efficacy were completed.\nWith regard to Pulmicort, the submission concluded that the costs of Pulmicort, either as a DPI or a pMDI, were within the range of costs of other corticosteroids. With regard to Symbicort, the submission concluded that fixed-dose Symbicort was dominated by Symbicort adjusted maintenance dosing. Fixed-dose Symbicort was also dominated by remaining on the same high-dose ICS alone (Symbicort was associated with greater costs and fewer quality-adjusted life years ) and by Seretide (equal efficacy was assumed between the combination devices and Symbicort was associated with greater costs). Symbicort was dominant over ICS and LABA delivered using separate devices (it was associated with equal efficacy and lower costs).\n\n【14】 ## GlaxoSmithKline submission\nThe submission from GlaxoSmithKline included analyses to support the use of three GlaxoSmithKline products: Becotide (beclometasone dipropionate delivered by a pMDI), Flixotide (fluticasone propionate delivered by either a DPI or a HFA-propelled pMDI) and Seretide (containing fluticasone propionate and salmeterol delivered by either a DPI or a HFA-propelled pMDI). The submission modelled the cost–utility of Seretide in comparison with the same dose of ICS, a higher dose of ICS, and the same dose of ICS and a LABA delivered using separate devices. Cost–utility analyses were not carried out comparing the different ICSs or comparing Seretide and Symbicort. Instead, analyses of costs assuming equal efficacy were completed.\nA common model was developed for both adults and children. The model had two states, in which people with asthma could be either with or without symptoms. The model was not a disease-progression model and did not involve transitions between the two health states. Effectiveness data for symptom-free days were taken from clinical trial data. Utility values, sourced from adults enrolled in the Gaining Optimal Asthma controL (GOAL) study, were 0.97 for the 'symptom-free' and 0.85 for 'with symptoms' health states.\n\n【15】 ## Meda Pharmaceuticals submission\nThe submission from Meda Pharmaceuticals included a cost-minimisation analysis for Novolizer (budesonide delivered by a DPI) compared with Pulmicort Turbohaler (the main budesonide DPI competitor). The submission calculated the costs of providing both devices at 400 micrograms per day over a 1-year period. The annual cost of Novolizer was estimated at £75.28 compared with £135.05 for Turbohaler, making a saving per person of £59.77. The submission concluded that, if all people (both adults and children) with asthma currently on Turbohaler were switched to Novolizer, there would be cost savings to the NHS of £3.7 million per year.\n\n【16】 ## Trinity Chiesi submission\nThe submission from Trinity Chiesi included a cost-minimisation analysis for Clenil Modulite (beclometasone dipropionate delivered by a CFC-free pMDI). The submission was in the context of the Montreal Protocol and the likely removal of CFC-containing devices such as Becotide (beclometasone dipropionate delivered by a pMDI). It calculated the annual cost of Clenil Modulite and two other commonly used non-CFC-containing devices, Asmabec and Becodisks. It compared the costs for these devices with those of Becotide at both 200 micrograms and 400 micrograms per day. Data were provided that demonstrated clinical equivalence with Becotide, but clinical equivalence was assumed for the other two products. The annual cost of Becotide 200 micrograms per day was calculated to be £10.18. This was compared with annual costs of £28.18 for Clenil Modulite, £35.81 for Asmabec and £73.00 for Becodisks. The annual costs for 400 micrograms per day were £29.71 for Becotide compared with £61.43 for Clenil Modulite, £71.61 for Asmabec and £139.13 for Becodisks. The submission concluded that, after the removal of CFC-containing devices, Clenil Modulite may be cost saving compared with alternatives, although overall the cost to the NHS would increase.\n\n【17】 ## The Assessment Group economic assessment\nTo compare the different ICSs, the Assessment Group calculated the mean annual treatment cost per child for each specific preparation. The doses of each ICS were calculated based on 200 micrograms per day, 400 micrograms per day and 800 micrograms per day of CFC-containing beclometasone dipropionate (or equivalent). For each of the above, an unweighted average (based on the number of products) and a weighted average (based on annual quantities sold) were calculated. Products were categorised as pMDI with CFC, pMDI with HFA, or DPI, with separate analyses including and excluding CFC-propelled products.\nOverall, beclometasone dipropionate was identified as the cheapest group of ICS products, with an average annual cost of £32 for the equivalent of 200 micrograms per day (unweighted). Excluding CFC-containing preparations increased the annual cost to an average of £42 (unweighted). The unweighted average annual costs of budesonide were calculated to be £61, including CFC-containing preparations, and £68, excluding CFC-containing preparations. The unweighted average annual cost of fluticasone propionate was calculated to be £68 and was unaffected by the exclusion of CFC-containing products. These analyses did not include two budesonide products (Novolizer and Easyhaler) that have comparatively low annual costs of approximately £40 and £34 for 200 micrograms per day, respectively.\nAt an equivalent of 400 micrograms per day, beclometasone dipropionate remained the cheapest group of ICS products, with an average annual cost of approximately £68 (unweighted). Excluding CFC-containing preparations increased the annual cost to an average of £92 (unweighted). The unweighted average annual costs of budesonide were calculated to be £106, including CFC-containing preparations, and £113, excluding CFC-containing preparations. The unweighted average annual cost of fluticasone propionate was calculated to be £128 and was unaffected by the exclusion of CFC-containing products. In general, the average figures concealed a wide variation in cost of the different products using the same drugs.\nTo examine the cost implications of switching a person with uncontrolled asthma from an ICS alone to either a higher dose of ICS (400 micrograms beclometasone dipropionate or equivalent) or adding a LABA to a lower dose of ICS (200 micrograms beclometasone dipropionate or equivalent), the Assessment Group calculated the cost of a GP-managed (£24) and hospital-managed (£1056) exacerbation and then identified the number of exacerbations that would need to be avoided to offset any additional costs. The Assessment Group calculated that Seretide Evohaler is currently cheaper than budesonide and fluticasone propionate at higher doses when the comparison is based on a weighted mean average cost (including CFC-containing products). However, in comparison with the weighted mean average cost of beclometasone dipropionate (including CFC-containing products), Seretide Evohaler was calculated to be £52 more expensive. This would mean that one hospital-managed exacerbation (costing £1056) would need to be averted for every 20 people using the combination devices.\nBoth Seretide Accuhaler and Symbicort Turbohaler are currently more expensive than doubling the dose of ICS. The additional costs in comparison with the weighted mean average cost of beclometasone dipropionate are £127 and £138 per year, respectively, in comparison with budesonide are £70 and £81, respectively, and in comparison with fluticasone propionate are £57 and £68, respectively (all including CFC-containing products). The Assessment Group concluded that the extra annual cost to the NHS of combination devices, compared with an increased dose of the different ICS drugs as monotherapy, can vary enormously depending on the exact ICS product used. It is difficult to interpret these results within the context of the clinical data available because of the lack of studies making the comparison between combination devices and increasing the dose of ICS alone. It is also unclear how additional costs would translate into estimates of incremental cost effectiveness.\nThe costs of separate ICSs and LABAs in different devices were compared with the costs of a corticosteroid and LABA in a single combination device. The analyses were based on the person receiving the manufacturers' corresponding separate ICS product (for example, the costs of separate devices in comparison to Symbicort were calculated using the price of Pulmicort Turbohaler rather than the price of budesonide Novolizer). For the budesonide/formoterol fumarate combination (Symbicort), the Assessment Group identified an annual saving per person of between £35 and £190 when the drugs were given in a combination device as opposed to separate devices. Cost savings were dependent on the daily dose of ICS required (for example, 200 or 400 micrograms) and the LABA preparation used. The annual cost savings associated with fluticasone propionate/salmeterol (Seretide) were between £132 and £274 using a combination device. Cost savings were dependent on the type of device used (for example, Accuhaler versus Evohaler) and the daily dose of ICS required (for example, 100 or 200 micrograms). However, Seretide Evohaler was associated with greater cost savings than Seretide Accuhaler.\nFinally, the Assessment Group compared the annual costs associated with providing a fixed dose of ICS with the different combination devices. For 200 micrograms per day beclometasone dipropionate equivalent, the cost of Symbicort was £201, compared with £190 and £115 for Seretide Accuhaler and Evohaler, respectively. The corresponding figures for 400 micrograms per day beclometasone dipropionate equivalent were £402, £379 and £233 per year. The Assessment Group concluded that, assuming equal efficacy, Seretide is currently less expensive than Symbicort, although this is based on a relatively crude assumption of clinical equivalence at a dose ratio of 1:2.\n\n【18】 #Consideration of the evidence\nThe Appraisal Committee reviewed the data available on the clinical and cost effectiveness of ICSs (including combination devices) for the treatment of chronic asthma in children under the age of 12 years, having considered evidence on the nature of the condition and the value placed on the benefits of ICSs by children with chronic asthma (and their parents), those who represent them, and clinical specialists. It was also mindful of the need to take account of the effective use of NHS resources.\nThe Committee heard from clinical specialists that when considering the management of asthma there was a need to distinguish between pre-school children and school-aged children with asthma, and that the evidence for the appropriate management of pre-school children was still emerging. The Committee heard from the clinical specialists that the BTS/SIGN guidelines were at present the most appropriate starting point for considering the management of children with asthma, but that future revisions to the guidelines may make further distinctions between different types of asthma that may have implications for management. The Committee was aware that uncertainties existed in the management of asthma and its diagnosis, but it recognised that within the scope of the appraisal, the evidence on the clinical effectiveness of ICSs and their use should be considered within the context of the BTS/SIGN guidelines on the management of asthma.\nICSs are a well-established therapeutic intervention. Therefore, research on ICSs tends to be done when new devices are developed. There is an ongoing programme of postmarketing research in relation to combination devices.\nThe Committee recognised the need for some larger and longer term comparative trials of ICSs in children younger than 12 years, with full assessment of side effects including growth and other effects on adrenal suppression.\nInhaler devices for routine treatment of chronic asthma in older children (aged 5–15 years).

There is a direct association between high LDL and cardiovascular disease.  Environmental and genetic factors are involved in the pathophysiology of high LDL.  Several conditions may contribute to the pathophysiology of high LDL, such as diet high in saturated fat, hypothyroidism, nephrotic syndrome, pregnancy, obesity, or medications such as amiodarone, cyclosporine, diuretics, and glucocorticoids.  Prior approaches to the management of LDL aimed towards the classification of LDL concentrations and the treatment of subjects with dyslipidemia to a target LDL concentration.  In 2001, the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III classified LDL concentrations into optimal, near optimal, borderline high, high, and very high.  However, the latest 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults no longer takes into consideration LDL cut-off concentration but rather identifies groups of patients among whom the benefit of statin outweighs the risk of adverse events.  There is an unmet need for more effective and tolerable therapies for the reduction of LDL-c, which is driving ongoing and future investigational therapies.\n\n【2】 #Historical Perspective\nFrom the early 1950s onward, Fredrickson specialized in the study of plasma lipoproteins, compounds of proteins and lipids which transport lipids in the blood.  However, the study of lipids in the blood has started early in the 1900's. In 1949, Faraday Society in Birmingham organized the first symposium on lipoproteins and separated for the first time lipoproteins into alpha and beta types.  In 1950, LDL was first isolated.  In 1973, Myant first hypothesized the role of LDL in the metabolism of cholesterol.\n\n【3】 #Classification\nPrior approaches to the management of LDL aimed towards the classification of LDL concentrations and the treatment of subjects with dyslipidemia to a target LDL concentration.  In 2001, the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III classified LDL concentrations into optimal, near optimal, borderline high, high, and very high.  However, the latest 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults no longer takes into consideration LDL cut-off concentration but rather identifies groups of patients among whom the benefit of statin outweighs the risk of adverse events.\n\n【4】 #Physiology\nLow-density lipoprotein (LDL) belongs to the lipoprotein particle family.  Its size is approximately 22 nm but since LDL particles contain a changing number of fatty acids they actually have a mass and size distribution. Each native LDL particle contains a single apolipoprotein B-100 molecule (Apo B-100, a protein with 4536 amino acid residues) that surrounds the fatty acids keeping them soluble in the aqueous environment.  The average composition of LDL is approximately 20% protein, 20% phospholipids, 40% cholesteryl esters, 10% unesterified cholesterol, and 5% triglycerides.\n\n【5】 #Pathophysiology\nEnvironmental and genetic factors are involved in the pathophysiology of high LDL.  Several conditions may contribute to the pathophysiology of high LDL, such as diet high in saturated fat, hypothyroidism, nephrotic syndrome, pregnancy, obesity, or medications such as amiodarone, cyclosporine, diuretics, and glucocorticoids.  Abnormally low LDL can occur, and they usually result from rare inherited conditions, such as familial hypobetalipoproteinemia and abetalipoproteinemia.\n\n【6】 ## Low LDL\nLow LDL levels can be caused by unusual inherited disorders of lipoprotein metabolism such as abetalipoproteinemia and hypobetalipoproteinemia.\n\n【7】 ## High LDL\nHigh LDL can be primary or secondary to diet high in saturated fat, hypothyroidism, nephrotic syndrome, pregnancy, obesity, or medications such as amiodarone, cyclosporine, diuretics, and glucocorticoids.  High LDL can also be caused by inherited diseases that affect the lipid metabolism.\n\n【8】 #Epidemiology and Demographics\nFrom 1976–1980 through 2007–2010, for U.S. adults aged 40–74, a decrease was observed in the prevalence of high LDL-cholesterol (LDL–C) from 59% to 28%, as well as an increase in adults using lipid-lowering medications and consuming a diet low in saturated fat. Despite recent advances in medical treatment, high LDL-C remains a significant public health problem in the United States, with more than one-quarter of adults aged 40–74 having high LDL–C.\n\n【9】 #Risk Factors\nRisk factors for high LDL include genetic predisposition, aging, and unhealthy life style choices.\n\n【10】 #Screening\nAccording to the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), screening for high LDL-cholesterol (LDL-c), is indicated among men 35 years and older (Grade: A Recommendation), men age 20 to 35 years in case of an elevated risk for coronary heart disease (Grade: B Recommendation), women age 45 years and older for in case of an elevated risk for coronary heart disease (Grade: A Recommendation), and women age 20 to 45 years in case of an elevated risk for coronary heart disease (Grade: B Recommendation).  There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening for dyslipidemia among infants, children, adolescents, or young adults less than 20 years of age (Grade: I statement).\n\n【11】 #Natural History, Complications and Prognosis\nThe natural history and the prognosis of high LDL concentrations are directly associated with the complications of atherosclerosis, namely cardiovascular disease (CVD) which is the most common cause of mortality worldwide. Classically, elevated LDL concentration has been associated with significantly increased rates of coronary artery disease (CAD). However, emerging evidence has demonstrated that an elevated concentration of LDL is also strongly associated with insulin resistance as well as other forms of ischemic vascular diseases. The role of elevated levels of LDL in the development of ischemic complications, such as stroke, peripheral arterial disease, carotid atherosclerosis, and renovascular injury, has also been validated. The development of complications due to atherosclerosis are the major factors that determine the prognosis of patients with elevated LDL concentrations.\n\n【12】 ## Laboratory Findings\nChemical measures of lipid concentration have long been the most-used clinical measurement, not because they have the best correlation with individual outcome, but because these lab methods are less expensive and more widely available.  However, there is increasing evidence and recognition of the value of more sophisticated measurements.  Specifically, LDL particle number (concentration), and to a lesser extent size, have shown much tighter correlation with atherosclerotic progression and cardiovascular events than is obtained using chemical measures of total LDL concentration contained within the particles.  LDL cholesterol concentration can be low, yet LDL particle number high and cardiovascular events rates are high.  Alternatively, LDL cholesterol concentration can be relatively high, yet LDL particle number low and cardiovascular events are also low.  If LDL particle concentration is tracked against event rates, many other statistical correlates of cardiovascular events, such as diabetes mellitus, obesity and smoking, lose much of their additive predictive power.\n\n【13】 ## Medical Therapy\nWhile prior approaches to the management of LDL plasma concentration aimed towards treating the subjects with dyslipidemia to a target LDL concentration, the latest 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults no longer takes into consideration LDL cut-off concentration but rather identifies groups of patients among whom the benefit of statin outweighs the risk of adverse events.  The 2013 ACC/AHA guidelines identifies the following statin benefit groups: subjects with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, subjects with LDL ≥ 190 mg/dL, subjects with diabetes mellitus PLUS age 40-75 years PLUS LDL 10-189 mg/dL, and subjects with LDL 70-189 mg/dL PLUS estimated 10 year risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease ≥ 7.5%.  The pooled cohort equation should be used to estimate the 10 year risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and guide the treatment among subjects with no diabetes mellitus or atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.  Lifestyle changes is a critical component of the management of patients with elevated LDL whether they are administered or not lipid lowering drugs.\n\n【14】 ## Future and Investigational Therapies\nThere is an association between the concentration of circulating LDL cholesterol (LDL-c) and the risk of cardiovascular disease.  There is an unmet need for more effective and tolerable therapies for the reduction of LDL-c.  Ongoing studies are evaluating novel lipid-lowering therapeutic strategies, including anti-sense oligonucleotides (ASOs) to apolipoprotein B (apo B), proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP), thyromimetics, squalene synthase, adenosine triphosphate-citrate lyase, AMP-activated protein kinase, and sterol regulatory element binding proteins.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Phylogenetic relatedness of S. anginosus, S. constellatus, and S. intermedius has been confirmed by rRNA sequence analysis.\n\n【2】 #General characteristics\nThe majority of Streptococcus anginosus strains produce acetoin from glucose, ferment lactose, trehalose, salicin, and sucrose, and hydrolyze esculin and arginine.  Carbon dioxide can stimulate growth or is even required for growth in certain strains.  Streptococcus anginosus may be beta-hemolytic or nonhemolytic.  Among the nonhemolytic strains, certain ones produced the alpha reaction on blood agar. However, of isolates examined in one study, 56% were nonreactive, 25% were beta reactive, and only 19% were alpha reactive.\n\n【3】 #Infections\nStreptococcus anginosus is part of the human bacteria flora, but can cause diseases including brain and liver abscesses under certain circumstances.\nThe habitat of S. anginosus is a wide variety of sites inside the human body.  Cultures have been taken from the mouth, throat, feces, and vagina, yielding both hemolytic (mouth) and nonhemolytic (fecal and vaginal strains). Because of the commonplace with this bacterium and the human body, there are a number of infections that are caused by S. anginosus.\nPyogenic liver abscess is associated with S. anginosus and in studies in the 1970s was reported to be the most common cause of hepatic abscess. It was also reported that S. anginosus rarely causes infections in healthy individuals but instead it is usually the immunodeficient individuals who were victim to this bacterium.  A case study was reported on a 40 year old man who frequently drank alcohol and had poor oral hygiene.  He was admitted to hospital with high fever and malaise. During diagnostic testing, a abscess was found on his liver, from which 550cc of hemopurulent exudate was drained.  The exudate was cultured and S. anginosus was found.  Disc diffusion technique revealed that bacterium was sensitive to penicillin.  Patient was asymptomatic on 30th day of treatment.  It was noted that the duration of symptoms is longer with liver abscesses associated with S. aginosus than with other microorganisms.\nAnother study showed a case with a diagnosis of sympathetic empyema that was likely secondary to splenic abscess.  Cultures of both sites grew Streptococcus anginosus.  The empyema responded well to treatments however the splenic abscess required three weeks of drainage before the abscess resolved.  Authors noted that there were no known cases of sympathetic empyema caused by Streptococcus anginosus.\n\n【4】 #Treatments\nThere are several antimicrobial resistant strains of this bacterium.

The maximum single dose for an adult is 1 g.\n\n【3】 ### Sedative\n- 30 to 50 mg given 2 or 3 times daily.\n\n【4】 ### Insomnia - It is use as an Hypnotic for the short-term treatment of insomnia, since it appears to lose its effectiveness for sleep induction and sleep maintenance after 2 weeks.\n- 65 to 200 mg at bedtime.\n\n【5】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Amobarbital sodium in adult patients.\n\n【6】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Amobarbital sodium in adult patients.\n\n【7】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Pediatric)\nThere is limited information regarding Amobarbital sodium FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Pediatric) in the drug label.\n\n【8】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Amobarbital sodium in pediatric patients.\n\n【9】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Amobarbital sodium in pediatric patients.\n\n【10】 #Contraindications\n- Hypersensitivity to barbiturates\n- Patients with a history of manifest or latent porphyria\n\n【11】 ### Habit Forming\n- Amobarbital sodium may be habit forming.\n- Tolerance, psychological and physical dependence may occur with continued use *Patients who have psychological dependence on barbiturates may increase the dosage or decrease the dosage interval without consulting a physician and may subsequently develop a physical dependence on barbiturates.\n- In order to minimize the possibility of overdosage or the development of dependence, the prescribing and dispensing of sedative-hypnotic barbiturates should be limited to the amount required for the interval until the next appointment.\n- Abrupt cessation after prolonged use in a person who is dependent on the drug may result in withdrawal symptoms, including delirium, convulsions, and possibly death.\n- Barbiturates should be withdrawn gradually from any patient known to be taking excessive doses over long periods of time.\n\n【12】 ### Intravenous Administration\n- Too rapid administration may cause respiratory depression, apnea, laryngo- spasm, or vasodilation with fall in blood pressure.\n\n【13】 ### Acute or Chronic Pain\n- Caution should be exercised when barbiturates are administered to patients with acute or chronic pain, because paradoxical excitement could be induced or important symptoms could be masked. However, the use of barbiturates as sedatives in the postoperative surgical period and as adjuncts to cancer chemotherapy is well established.\n\n【14】 ### Usage in Pregnancy\n- Barbiturates can cause fetal damage when administered to a pregnant woman. *Retrospective, case-controlled studies have suggested a connection between the maternal consumption of barbiturates and a higher than expected incidence of fetal abnormalities.\n- Fetal blood levels approach maternal blood levels following parenteral administration.\n- Withdrawal symptoms occur in infants born to women who receive barbiturates throughout the last trimester of pregnancy.\n- If amobarbital sodium is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.\n\n【15】 ### Synergistic Effects\n- The concomitant use of alcohol or other CNS depressants may produce additive CNS- depressant effects.\n\n【16】 ## Clinical Trials Experience\nThe following adverse reactions and their incidence were compiled from surveillance of thousands of hospitalized patients who received barbiturates. Because such patients may be less aware of certain of the milder adverse effects of barbiturates, the incidence of these reactions may be somewhat higher in fully ambulatory patients.\n\n【17】 ### More than 1 in 100 Patients\n- The most common adverse reaction, estimated to occur at a rate of 1 to 3 patients per 100, is the following:\n- Somnolence\n\n【18】 ### Less than 1 in 100 Patients\n- Adverse reactions estimated to occur at a rate of less than 1 in 100 patients are listed below, grouped by organ system and by decreasing order of occurrence:\n- Agitation\n- Confusion\n- Hyperkinesia - Ataxia - CNS depression\n- Nightmares\n- Nervousness\n- Psychiatric disturbance\n- Hallucinations\n- Insomnia - Dizziness\n- Abnormality in thinking\n- Apnea - Postoperative atelectasis - Bradycardia - Syncope\n- Nausea - Vomiting\n- Headache\n- Hypersensitivity reactions (angioedema, skin rashes, exfoliative dermatitis)\n- Fever\n- Liver damage\n- Megaloblastic anemia following chronic phenobarbital use\n\n【19】 ## Postmarketing Experience\nThere is limited information regarding Amobarbital sodium Postmarketing Experience in the drug label.\n\n【20】 #Drug Interactions\nMost reports of clinically significant drug interactions occurring with the barbiturates have involved phenobarbital. However, the application of these data to other barbiturates appears valid and warrants serial blood level determinations of the relevant drugs when there are multiple therapies.\n\n【21】 ### Anticoagulants\n- Phenobarbital lowers the plasma levels of dicumarol and causes a decrease in anticoagulant activity as measured by the prothrombin time.\n- Barbiturates can induce hepatic microsomal enzymes, resulting in increased metabolism and decreased anticoagulant response of oral anticoagulants (eg, warfarin, acenocoumarol, dicumarol, and phenprocoumon).\n- The effect of the resultant decreased blood levels of griseofulvin on therapeutic response has not been established. However, it would be preferable to avoid concomitant administration of these drugs.\n- This mechanism is probably through the induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes that metabolize the antibiotic.\n- If amobarbital sodium and doxycycline are administered concurrently, the clinical response to doxycycline should be monitored closely.\n- Some investigators report an accelerating effect, whereas others report no effect. Because the effect of barbiturates on the metabolism of phenytoin is not predictable, phenytoin and barbiturate blood levels should be monitored more frequently if these drugs are given concurrently.\n- Sodium valproate and valproic acid appear to increase the amobarbital sodium serum levels; therefore, amobarbital sodium blood levels should be closely monitored and appropriate dosage adjustments made as clinically indicated.\n- MAOIs prolong the effects of barbiturates, probably because metabolism of the barbiturate is inhibited.\n- An alternate contraceptive method might be suggested to women taking barbiturates.\n\n【22】 ### Pregnancy\nPregnancy Category (FDA): D\n- Barbiturates can cause fetal damage when administered to a pregnant woman. *Retrospective, case-controlled studies have suggested a connection between the maternal consumption of barbiturates and a higher than expected incidence of fetal abnormalities.\n- Fetal blood levels approach maternal blood levels following parenteral administration.\n- Withdrawal symptoms occur in infants born to women who receive barbiturates throughout the last trimester of pregnancy.\n- If amobarbital sodium is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.\nThere is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Amobarbital sodium in women who are pregnant.\n\n【23】 ### Labor and Delivery\n- Hypnotic doses of barbiturates do not appear to impair uterine activity significantly during labor.\n- Full anesthetic doses of barbiturates decrease the force and frequency of uterine contractions.\n- Administration of sedative-hypnotic barbiturates to the mother during labor may result in respiratory depression in the newborn.\n- Premature infants are particularly susceptible to the depressant effects of barbiturates.\n- If barbiturates are used during labor and delivery, resuscitation equipment should be available.\n- Data are not available to evaluate the effect of barbiturates when forceps delivery or other intervention is necessary or to determine the effect of barbiturates on the later growth, development, and functional maturation of the child.\n\n【24】 ### Nursing Mothers\n- Caution should be exercised when amobarbital sodium is administered to a nursing woman because small amounts of barbiturates are excreted in the milk.\n\n【25】 ### Pediatric Use\n- Safety and effectiveness have not been established in children below the age of 6 years.\n- Children, barbiturates repeatedly produce excitement rather than depression.\n\n【26】 ### Geriatic Use\n- Elderly or debilitated patients may react to barbiturates with marked excitement, depression, or confusion.\n\n【27】 ### Gender\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Amobarbital sodium with respect to specific gender populations.\n\n【28】 ### Race\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Amobarbital sodium with respect to specific racial populations.\n\n【29】 ### Renal Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Amobarbital sodium in patients with renal impairment.\n\n【30】 ### Hepatic Impairment\n- Barbiturates should be administered with caution and initially in reduced doses.\n\n【31】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Amobarbital sodium in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n\n【32】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\nThere is no FDA guidance one the use of Amobarbital sodium in patients who are immunocompromised.\n\n【33】 ### Intramuscular Use\n- Intramuscular injection of the sodium salts of barbiturates should be made deeply into a large muscle.\n- The average intramuscular dose ranges from 65 mg to 0.5 g.\n- A volume of 5 mL (irrespective of concentration) should not be exceeded at any one site because of possible tissue irritation.\n- Twenty percent solutions may be used so that a small volume can contain a large dose.\n- After IM injection of a hypnotic dose, the patient’s vital signs should be monitored.\n\n【34】 ### Intravenous Use\n- Intravenous injection is restricted to conditions in which other routes are not feasible, either because the patient is unconscious (as in cerebral hemorrhage, eclampsia, or status epilepticus), because the patient resists (as in delirium), or because prompt action is imperative.\n- Slow IV injection is essential, and patients should be carefully observed during administration.\n- This requires that blood pressure, respiration, and cardiac function be maintained, vital signs be recorded and equipment for resuscitation and artificial ventilation be available.\n- The rate of IV injection for adults should not exceed 50 mg/min to prevent sleep or sudden respiratory depression.\n\n【35】 ### Monitoring\n- After IM injection of a hypnotic dose, the patient’s vital signs should be monitored.\n- Prolonged therapy with barbiturates should be accompanied by periodic evaluation of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal, and hepatic systems\n\n【36】 #IV Compatibility\n- Solutions of amobarbital sodium should be made up aseptically with Sterile Water for Injection.\n\n【37】 - Ordinarily, a 10% solution is used.\n- After Sterile Water for Injection is added, the vial should be rotated to facilitate solution of the powder.\n- Do not shake the vial.\n- Several minutes may be required for the drug to dissolve completely, but under no circumstances should a solution be injected if it has not become absolutely clear within 5 minutes. Also, a solution that forms a precipitate after clearing should not be used.\n- Amobarbital sodium hydrolyzes in solution or on exposure to air.\n- Not more than 30 minutes should elapse from the time the vial is opened until its contents are injected.\n- Prior to administration, parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration whenever solution containers permit.\n\n【38】 #Overdosage\n- The toxic dose of barbiturates varies considerably.\n- In general, an oral dose of 1 g of most barbiturates produces serious poisoning in an adult.\n- Toxic effects and fatalities have occurred following overdoses of amobarbital sodium alone and in combination with other CNS depressants.\n- Death commonly occurs after 2 to 10 g of ingested barbiturate.\n- The sedated, therapeutic blood levels of amobarbital range between 2 to 10 mcg/mL; the usual lethal blood level ranges from 40 to 80 mcg/mL.\n- Barbiturate intoxication may be confused with alcoholism, bromide intoxication, and various neurologic disorders.\n- Potential tolerance must be considered when evaluating significance of dose and plasma concentration.\n\n【39】 ### Signs and Symptoms\n- Symptoms of oral overdose may occur within 15 minutes beginning with CNS depression, absent or sluggish reflexes, underventilation, hypotension, and hypothermia and may progress to pulmonary edema and death.\n- Hemorrhagic blisters may develop, especially at pressure points.\n- In extreme overdose, all electrical activity in the brain may cease, in which case a “flat” EEG normally equated with clinical death cannot be accepted.\n- This effect is fully reversible unless hypoxic damage occurs.\n- Consideration should be given to the possibility of barbiturate intoxication even in situations that appear to involve trauma.\n- Complications such as pneumonia, pulmonary edema, cardiac arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, and renal failure may occur.\n- Uremia may increase CNS sensitivity to barbiturates if renal function is impaired.\n- Differential diagnosis should include hypoglycemia, head trauma, cerebrovascular accidents, convulsive states, and diabetic coma.\n\n【40】 ### Treatment\n- To obtain up-to-date information about the treatment of overdose, a good resource is your certified Regional Poison Control Center.\n- In managing overdosage, consider the possibility of multiple drug overdoses, interaction among drugs, and unusual drug kinetics in your patient.\n- Protect the patient’s airway and support ventilation and perfusion. *Meticulously monitor and maintain, within acceptable limits, the patient’s vital signs, blood gases, serum electrolytes, etc.\n- Absorption of drugs from the gastrointestinal tract may be decreased by giving activated charcoal, which, in many cases, is more effective than emesis or lavage; consider charcoal instead of or in addition to gastric emptying. *Repeated doses of charcoal over time may hasten elimination of some drugs that have been absorbed.\n- Safeguard the patient’s airway when employing gastric emptying or charcoal.\n- If the patient has chronically abused sedatives, withdrawal reactions may be manifest following acute overdose.\n\n【41】 ## Mechanism of Action\n- Barbiturates are capable of producing all levels of CNS mood alteration, from excitation to mild sedation, hypnosis, and deep coma.\n- Overdosage can produce death.\n- In high enough therapeutic doses, barbiturates induce anesthesia.\n- Barbiturate-induced sleep differs from physiologic sleep.\n- Sleep laboratory studies have demonstrated that barbiturates reduce the amount of time spent in the rapid eye movement (REM) phase of sleep or the dreaming stage.\n- Also, Stages III and IV sleep are decreased.\n- Following abrupt cessation of barbiturates used regularly, patients may experience markedly increased dreaming, nightmares, and/or insomnia. Therefore, withdrawal of a single therapeutic dose over 5 or 6 days has been recommended to lessen the REM rebound and disturbed sleep that contribute to the drug withdrawal syndrome (for example, the dose should be decreased from 3 to 2 doses/day for 1 week).\n- In studies, secobarbital sodium and pentobarbital sodium have been found to lose most of their effectiveness for both inducing and maintaining sleep by the end of 2 weeks of continued drug administration, even with the use of multiple doses.\n- As with secobarbital sodium and pentobarbital sodium, other barbiturates (including amobarbital) might be expected to lose their effectiveness for inducing and maintaining sleep after about 2 weeks.\n- The short-, intermediate-, and to a lesser degree, long-acting barbiturates have been widely prescribed for treating insomnia. Although the clinical literature abounds with claims that the short-acting barbiturates are superior for producing sleep whereas the intermediate-acting compounds are more effective in maintaining sleep, controlled studies have failed to demonstrate these differential effects. Therefore, as sleep medications, the barbiturates are of limited value beyond short-term use.\n- With hypnotic doses, respiratory depression produced by barbiturates is similar to that which occurs during physiologic sleep and is accompanied by a slight decrease in blood pressure and heart rate.\n- Studies in laboratory animals have shown that barbiturates cause reduction in the tone and contractility of the uterus, ureters, and urinary bladder. However, concentrations of the drugs required to produce this effect in humans are not reached with sedative-hypnotic doses.\n\n【42】 ## Structure\n- Amobarbital sodium is a white, friable, granular powder that is odorless, has a bitter taste, and is hygroscopic.\n- It is very soluble in water, soluble in alcohol, and practically insoluble in ether and chloroform. Amobarbital sodium is sodium 5-ethyl-5-isopentylbarbiturate and has the empirical formula C11H17N2NaO3Its molecular weight is 248.26.\nIt has the following structural formula:\n\n【43】 ## Pharmacodynamics\nThere is limited information regarding Amobarbital sodium Pharmacodynamics in the drug label.\n\n【44】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n- Barbiturates are absorbed in varying degrees following oral or parenteral administration.\n- The salts are more rapidly absorbed than are the acids.\n- The rate of absorption is increased if the sodium salt is ingested as a dilute solution or taken on an empty stomach.\n- For intramuscular (IM) administration, the onset of action is slightly faster.\n- Following intravenous (IV) administration, the onset of action ranges from almost immediately for pentobarbital sodium to 5 minutes for phenobarbital sodium.\n- Maximal CNS depression may not occur until 15 minutes or more after IV administration for phenobarbital sodium.\n- Duration of action, which is related to the rate at which the barbiturates are redistributed throughout the body, varies among persons and in the same person from time to time.\n- Amobarbital sodium, an intermediate-acting barbiturate, is a CNS depressant. *For the oral form, the onset of sedative and hypnotic action is 3/4 to 1 hour, with a duration of action ranging from 6 to 8 hours.\n- These values should serve as a guide but not be used to predict exact duration of effect.\n- No studies have demonstrated that the different routes of administration are equivalent with respect to bioavailability.\n- Lipid solubility of the barbiturates is the dominant factor in their distribution within the body.\n- Phenobarbital has the lowest lipid solubility, lowest plasma binding, lowest brain protein binding, the longest delay in onset of activity, and the longest duration of action.\n- At the opposite extreme is secobarbital, which has the highest lipid solubility, highest plasma protein binding, highest brain protein binding, the shortest delay in onset of activity, and the shortest duration of action. *Amobarbital sodium is classified as an intermediate barbiturate.\n- Barbiturates are metabolized primarily by the hepatic microsomal enzyme system, and the metabolic products are excreted in the urine and, less commonly, in the feces.\n- Only a negligible amount of amobarbital sodium is eliminated unchanged in the urine.\n\n【45】 ### Carcinogenesis\nPhenobarbital sodium is carcinogenic in mice and rats after lifetime adminis- tration. In mice, it produced benign and malignant liver cell tumors. In rats, benign liver cell tumors were observed very late in life.\nIn a 29-year epidemiologic study of 9,136 patients who were treated on an anticonvulsant protocol that included phenobarbital, results indicated a higher than normal incidence of hepatic carcinoma. Previously, some of these patients had been treated with thorotrast, a drug that is known to produce hepatic carcinomas. Thus, this study did not provide sufficient evidence that phenobarbital sodium is carcinogenic in humans.\nA retrospective study of 84 children with brain tumors matched to 73 normal controls and 78 cancer controls (malignant disease other than brain tumors) suggested an association between exposure to barbiturates prenatally and an increased incidence of brain tumors.\n\n【46】 #Clinical Studies\nThere is limited information regarding Amobarbital sodium Clinical Studies in the drug label.\n\n【47】 #How Supplied\n- Amobarbital sodium Vials 0.5 g (dry powder) are available as follows:\n\n【48】 ## Storage\n- Store at 59° to 86°F (15° to 30°C).\n\n【49】 #Patient Counseling Information\nThe following information should be given to patients receiving barbiturates.\n- The use of barbiturates carries with it an associated risk of psychological and/or physical dependence.\n- Barbiturates may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks, such as driving a car or operating machinery.\n- The patient should be cautioned accordingly.\n- Alcohol should not be consumed while taking barbiturates.\n- The concurrent use of the barbiturates with other CNS depressants (eg, alcohol, narcotics, tranquilizers, and antihistamines) may result in additional CNS-depressant effects.\n\n【50】 #Precautions with Alcohol\n- Alcohol should not be consumed while taking barbiturates. The concurrent use of the barbiturates with other CNS depressants (eg, alcohol, narcotics, tranquilizers, and antihistamines) may result in additional CNS-depressant effects.\n\n【51】 #Brand Names\n- Amytal\n\n【52】 #Look-Alike Drug Names\nThere is limited information regarding Amobarbital sodium Look-Alike Drug Names in the drug label.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

It consists of different diseases with different clinical courses and treatment options. Glomerular disease can be isolated hematuria, isolated proteinuria; acute or chronic glomerulonephritis, and nephrotic or nephritic features of glomerulonephritis.

In addition, they had a history of failing to respond to or not tolerating previous lithium carbonate treatment. Valproate was initiated at a dose of 250 mg TID and adjusted to achieve serum valproate concentrations in a range of 50-100 mcg/mL by day 7. Mean valproate doses for completers in this study were 1118, 1525, and 2402 mg/day at Days 7, 14, and 21, respectively. Patients were assessed on the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS; score ranges from 0-60), an augmented Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS-A), and the Global Assessment Scale (GAS).

Thus, in a display of this type, the curve for an effective treatment is shifted to the left of the curve for placebo For example, 45% of patients treated with valproate had a ≥ 50% reduction in complex partial seizure rate compared to 23% of patients treated with placebo.\nThe second study assessed the capacity of valproate to reduce the incidence of CPS when administered as the sole AED. The study compared the incidence of CPS among patients randomized to either a high- or low-dose treatment arm. Patients qualified for entry into the randomized comparison phase of this study only if 1 they continued to experience 2 or more CPS per 4 weeks during an 8- to 12- week-long period of monotherapy with adequate doses of an AED (i.e. phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, or primidone) and 2 they made a successful transition over a 2-week interval to valproate. Patients entering the randomized phase were then brought to their assigned target dose, gradually tapered off their concomitant AED and followed for an interval as long as 22 weeks. Less than 50% of the patients randomized, however, completed the study. In patients converted to valproate monotherapy, the mean total valproate concentrations during monotherapy were 71 and 123 mcg/mL in the low-dose and high-dose groups, respectively.\n\n【3】 ### 14.3 Migraine\nThe results of 2 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials established the effectiveness of valproate in the prophylactic treatment of migraine headache.\nBoth studies employed essentially identical designs and recruited patients with a history of migraine with or without aura (of at least 6 months in duration) who were experiencing at least 2 migraine headaches a month during the 3 months prior to enrollment. Patients with cluster headaches were excluded. Women of childbearing potential were excluded entirely from one study, but were permitted in the other if they were deemed to be practicing an effective method of contraception.\nIn each study following a 4-week single-blind placebo baseline period, patients were randomized, under double blind conditions, to Valproate or placebo for a 12-week treatment phase, comprised of a 4-week dose titration period followed by an 8-week maintenance period. Treatment outcome was assessed on the basis of 4-week migraine headache rates during the treatment phase.\nIn the first study, a total of 107 patients (24 M, 83 F), ranging in age from 26 to 73 were randomized 2:1, valproate to placebo. Ninety patients completed the 8-week maintenance period. Drug dose titration, using 250-mg tablets, was individualized at the investigator’s discretion. Adjustments were guided by actual/sham trough total serum valproate levels in order to maintain the study blind. In patients on valproate doses ranged from 500 to 2500 mg a day. Doses over 500 mg were given in 3 divided doses (TID). The mean dose during the treatment phase was 1087 mg/day resulting in a mean trough total valproate level of 72.5 mcg/mL, with a range of 31 to 133 mcg/mL.\nThe mean 4-week migraine headache rate during the treatment phase was 5.7 in the placebo group compared to 3.5 in the valproate group . These rates were significantly different.\nThe initial dose was 250 mg daily. The regimen was advanced by 250 mg every 4 days (8 days for 500 mg/day group), until the randomized dose was achieved. The mean trough total valproate levels during the treatment phase were 39.6, 62.5, and 72.5 mcg/mL in the valproate 500, 1000, and 1500 mg/day groups, respectively.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Is COVID-19 immunization recommended for people with solid cancers? COVID-19 vaccines should be encouraged for people with solid cancers and are not contraindicated, including those who have had COVID-19 infection. This recommendation is based on the following review: - The National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) recommends that immunosuppressed individuals be offered the vaccine if the benefits of vaccines outweigh the potential risks. 1 - Patients with cancer have an increased risk of death related to COVID-19 infection.  - The United Kingdom, the United States, France, and Australia have prioritized patients with cancer for COVID-19 immunizations, highlighting that this population is considered as having an increased COVID-19 risk.  Is the COVID-19 vaccine efficacious and safe in patients with solid cancers? There are data to suggest that the currently available COVID-19 vaccines have efficacy in patients with cancer or undergoing therapy for their cancer (cytotoxic chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy) and/or radiation therapy (external-beam, brachytherapy, or systemic), while there may still be uncertainty as to the timing of immunization in relation to their cancer treatments.  As with most vaccines, there may be a blunted immune response in individuals who are immunocompromised due to their disease or treatment. Patients with active cancer or undergoing active cancer treatment seemed to be generally excluded from the COVID-19 vaccine trials.  However, in the COMIRNATY (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine trial, 3.9% of enrolled participants had a malignancy. 22 There is one study that suggests that a third dose of COVID-19 vaccine in immunocompromised patients can increase COVID-19 Vaccines for People with Solid Cancer\n\n【1】 #\nantibody levels. 23 Small studies on third doses of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines have shown that immunogenicity (immunity measured in the blood) may increase with a third dose. However, it is unclear how much antibody is needed for protection and/or the role of other immunological responses. 22 The frequency and severity of adverse events following vaccination with an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in these populations were comparable to that of non-immunosuppressed individuals in these studies and what was reported in clinical trials. Safety data in these populations following vaccination with a viral vector vaccine is not available. 24 Informed consent should include discussion about the possibility that individuals who are immunosuppressed may have a diminished immune response to any of the authorized COVID-19 vaccines. 25 Are there any specific contraindications or exceptions for people with solid cancers?\nIndividuals who have had a severe allergic reaction to an ingredient of one type of COVID-19 vaccine are still able to receive future doses of the other type of vaccine. 26 BCCDC has a list of the individual components and their purpose in the vaccines.\nPeople with a history of anaphylaxis without known or obvious cause, and those with suspected hypersensitivity or nonanaphylactic allergy to COVID-19 vaccine components, are advised to consult with an allergist prior to immunization, If there is a specific concern about a possible allergy to a component of the COVID-19 vaccine being administered, an extended period of observation for 30 minutes post-vaccination may be warranted. Alternatively, the vaccine can be administered in an emergency room setting with an extended observation period. 27 Potential allergens known to cause type I hypersensitivities include polyethylene glycol (PEG) in the mRNA vaccines and polysorbate 80 in the viral vector vaccines:\n\n【2】 #Polyethylene glycol (PEG)\nPolysorbate 80\n- COMIRNATY, COMIRNATY Bivalent 28,29 (Pfizer-BioNTech) 19 - SPIKEVAX, SPIKEVAX Bivalent 30 (Moderna) 20 - VAXZEVRIA (AstraZeneca) 21 - JCOVDEN (Janssen) 31 - NUVAXOVID (Novovax) 32 Health Canada continues to monitor any adverse events following immunization through their post-authorization surveillance process.\nCurrently, it is recommended that COVID-19 vaccines can be given concomitantly with, or any time before or after any other indicated vaccine including the seasonal influenza vaccine.  COVID-19 Vaccines for People with Solid Cancers Updated: April 18, 2023 Are there specific recommendations or considerations for safe and/or most effective administration?\nThere are no known studies regarding the timing of COVID-19 vaccine in relation to systemic therapy for cancer. The current vaccines reviewed in this clinical guidance are given as two doses (COMIRNATY, COMIRNATY Bivalent , SPIKEVAX, SPIKEVAX Bivalent , VAXZEVRIA ). For the two-dose vaccines, optimal protection assumed after the second dose for the general population. The efficacy and duration of immunity after the first dose of a two-dose vaccine are continuously being evaluated and recommendations are evolving rapidly. The optimal protection and degree of protection, if any, in immunosuppressed individuals are currently unknown. Therefore, patients should be vaccinated following the current advice from the BC Centre for Disease Control.\nPatients with cancer who are undergoing chemotherapy or other cancer treatments that affect the immune system will be offered vaccination according to B.C.'s COVID-19 Immunization Plan. In general, it is preferred that patients complete immunization before starting immunosuppressive therapy if possible, ideally with at least 14 days after the second dose of the vaccines. However, there is emerging evidence that significant protection against severe illness and death is obtained even after the first dose of the two-dose vaccines. BCCDC recommends a third dose of vaccine at least 28 days after the second dose for immunocompromised. 37 *However, life-saving or -prolonging therapy should not be delayed solely to complete immunization Any other timing would require case-by-case assessment based on: a. Risk of morbidity related to COVID-19 infection (including local incidence of the pandemic, cancer type, comorbidities that confer higher risk in the general population, etc.) b. Cancer-related morbidity due to delay of active treatment, and c. Suboptimal immunity protection due to insufficient time window between immunization and immunosuppressive therapy.\n\n【3】 #Special considerations for immunotherapy:\nThe general recommendation for patients on immunotherapy is to proceed with COVID-19 immunization.- a. Rituximab and other anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies Of note, patients receiving these agents may have a reduced immune response to vaccines in general that can extend up to 6 months following treatment completion. These patients may benefit from a 3rd dose of vaccine as per BCCDC guidance, to be given at least 28 days after the second dose. 37 COVID-19 Vaccines for People with Solid Cancers Updated: April 18, 2023 b. Checkpoint inhibitors Previous studies have not signalled an increased risk of complications of COVID-19 disease for patients on checkpoint inhibitors such as CTLA-4 inhibitors (e.g. ipilimumab), PD-1 inhibitors (e.g. nivolumab, pembrolizumab, cemiplimab) and PD-L1 inhibitors (e.g. atezolizumab, avelumab, durvalumab). There have been theoretical concerns of an enhanced immune reaction to COVID-19 vaccines, particularly with CTLA-4 inhibitors.\n- Given the seriousness of COVID-19 infection, COVID-19 immunization is recommended with consideration of both the patient's risk profile and immunotherapy regimen. This follows the general vaccination guidelines for immunocompromised patients  :\n- First dose of two-dose vaccines (single dose if singledose vaccine) at least 2 weeks before treatment\n- For two-dose vaccines, second dose at least two weeks before treatment- *In general, it is preferred that patients complete immunization before starting immunosuppressive therapy if possible, based on the timing of the treatments and the availability of vaccines at the time. However, life-saving or -prolonging therapy should not be delayed solely to complete immunization. Some immunity may be achieved following the first dose of the two-dose vaccines.\nFor patients who received 2 doses while on or shortly after active treatment, a third dose is advised.\n-During cyclical treatment First dose of two-dose vaccines (or single dose if singledose vaccine) in the week before next treatment as this is when counts are likely to be the highest.\nPatients due to start radiation therapy If immunization is pending, and it is possible to delay radiation therapy without compromising outcomes, radiation therapy should be postponed until anticipated immunity is achieved before commencing radiation therapy. Life-saving or prolonging therapy should not be delayed solely to complete immunization.\nPatients on radiation therapy ‡ At any time during treatment while blood counts are near normal range, ideally as early in the course of radiation therapy as possible.\nRadiation therapy can suppress lymphocyte counts for months to years after treatment in a dose-and volumedependent fashion. As it is not known what level of WBC counts would alter vaccine efficacy, there is no specific blood count level to target for vaccine delivery; however, if the radiation therapy regimen  is expected to cause transient myelosuppression for up to eight weeks, immunization should start at least one week after the nadir of myelosuppression.\n- Immunosuppressive therapy -including but not limited to cytotoxic chemotherapy, rituximab, obinutuzumab, alemtuzumab  This recommendation does not relate to inhaled, nebulized, intra-articular, intrabursal or topical corticosteroids, which have no bearing on immunization timing. ‡Injection should be given on the opposite side if unilateral radiation treatment is, or was, given to area of injection site  Myelosuppression on radiation therapy regimens varies with dose, fractionation, and patient factors but typically examples of suppressive regimens include hemi-body, total body, total marrow, whole abdominal, craniospinal, or total skin radiation.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

The evidence on safety is adequate. The procedure may be used during radical prostatectomy or radical cystectomy provided normal arrangements are in place for clinical governance and audit.\nClinicians wishing to undertake intraoperative red blood cell salvage during radical prostatectomy or radical cystectomy should ensure that patients understand the possible risks and benefits of the procedure compared with those of allogeneic blood transfusion, and provide them with clear, written information. In addition, use of the Institute's information for patients ('Understanding NICE guidance') is recommended\n\n【2】 #The procedure\n\n【3】 #Indications and current treatments\nDuring either radical prostatectomy or radical cystectomy, patients may lose a considerable amount of blood. Conventionally, these patients receive a blood transfusion using allogeneic, banked blood, which carries a small risk of infection (for example, with hepatitis, human immunodeficiency virus , variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease ) or antibodymediated transfusion reaction. Exceptionally, autologous blood can be collected and stored before an elective operation, and transfused during or after the operation as required .\nIntraoperative red blood cell salvage offers an alternative to allogeneic or pre-donated autologous blood transfusion. It may also be useful in the treatment of patients who object to allogeneic blood transfusion on religious or other grounds.\n\n【4】 #Outline of the procedure\nBlood lost during radical prostatectomy or radical cystectomy is aspirated from the surgical field using a suction catheter. The blood is then filtered to remove debris. The filtered blood is washed or spun and the red blood cells are resuspended in saline, for transfusion during or after the operation. A leukocyte depletion filter is nearly always used; this is thought to minimise the risk of re-infusion of malignant cells that may be present in the aspirate. A number of different devices are available for this procedure.\nSections 2.3 and 2.4 describe efficacy and safety outcomes which were available in the published literature and which the Committee considered as part of the evidence about this procedure\n\n【5】 #Efficacy\nA case series of 49 patients treated with red blood cell salvage during radical cystectomy (either alone or in combination with other surgery) reported overall and disease-free survival rates of 88% (43/49) and 80% (39/49), respectively, at 24-month follow-up. No studies were available that described efficacy outcomes for the use of intraoperative red blood cell salvage during prostatectomy.\nThe Specialist Advisers considered key efficacy outcomes to include reductions in allogeneic transfusion requirements, haemoglobin levels and perioperative immunomodulation.\n\n【6】 #Safety\nA non-randomised controlled study of patients who were treated with radical prostatectomy reported similar rates of biochemical prostate cancer recurrence in 265 patients treated intraoperatively with salvaged red blood cells and 773 patients who did not require re-infusion (15% and 18% respectively, p = 0.76) at 5-year follow-up. Subgroup analysis of patients at 'low', 'intermediate' and 'high' risk (Gleason score) also found no significant difference in biochemical recurrence rates between the two groups (absolute numbers not reported).\nA second non-randomised controlled study of patients who were treated with radical prostatectomy reported biochemical recurrence in 5% (3/62) of patients treated intraoperatively with salvaged red blood cells at 7-month follow-up. The study reported biochemical recurrence in 24% (24/101) of patients transfused with pre-donated autologous blood at 43-month follow-up (substantially different follow-up times noted). Progression-free survival was not significantly different between the groups (p = 0.41) at 43-month follow-up. In the same study, postoperative haematocrit levels were significantly higher in patients given salvaged red blood cells (31.3 ± 3.5%) than in those who received pre-donated autologous blood (27.9 ± 3.4%).\nA case series of 49 patients who were treated with radical cystectomy and who received salvaged red blood cells reported that there were no complications directly related to red blood cell salvage transfusion at 24-month follow-up. No major reactions to transfusions were noted and no patient demonstrated clinical or biochemical evidence of hepatitis.\nThe Specialist Advisers considered key safety outcomes to include transient hypertension, length of hospital stay, need for intensive care unit stay, infection rates, thrombosis and bleeding. An additional theoretical adverse event noted by the Advisers was re-infusion of cancerous cells leading to distant metastases.\n\n【7】 #Other comments\nThe Committee noted concern about the theoretical risk of infusing viable cancer cells that might cause metastases. However, there was no evidence in reported series that this occurred, and any such theoretical risk needs to be balanced against the potential risks of allogeneic blood transfusion. The Committee did not consider it likely that further long-term research would identify metastases that might have been caused by re-infused malignant cells.\nThe Institute has produced interventional procedures guidance on intraoperative blood cell salvage in obstetrics.\nNHS Blood and Transplant recommend use of the British Committee for Standards in Haematology's 'Guidelines for policies on alternatives to allogeneic blood transfusion' in relation to preoperative autologous blood transfusion.\n\n【8】 #\nThe evidence considered by the Interventional Procedures Advisory Committee is described in the overview.\n\n【9】 #Information for patients\nNICE has produced information on this procedure for patients and carers ('Understanding NICE guidance'). It explains the nature of the procedure and the guidance issued by NICE, and has been written with patient consent in mind\n\n【10】 #Changes since publication\nNICE considered the evidence relating to the efficacy and safety of intraoperative blood cell salvage in obstetrics (IPG144) and for intraoperative red blood cell salvage during radical prostatectomy or radical cystectomy (IPG258) in response to concerns expressed about theoretical risks associated with the procedure. These concerns were the possibility of amniotic fluid embolism and haemolytic disease in future pregnancies when used in obstetrics, and reinfusion of malignant cells when used in radical prostatectomy/cystectomy.\nThe evidence relating to safety of cell salvage in these procedures was considered adequate and therefore NICE does not intend to review its use in other specific clinical situations unless notified of new indications for intraoperative cell salvage in which there may be new safety concerns.\nJanuary 2012: minor maintenance\n\n【11】 #About this guidance\nThis guidance was developed using the NICE interventional procedure guidance process.\nWe have produced a summary of this guidance for patients and carers. Information about the evidence it is based on is also available.\nYour responsibility\nThis guidance represents the views of NICE and was arrived at after careful consideration of the available evidence.

Common adverse reactions include urinary tract infections, female genital mycotic infections, hypoglycemia, hypotension.\n\n【2】 ### Indicatios\n- JARDIANCE is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.\n\n【3】 ### Dosage\n- The recommended dose of JARDIANCE is 10 mg once daily in the morning, taken with or without food. In patients tolerating JARDIANCE, the dose may be increased to 25 mg .\n- In patients with volume depletion, correcting this condition prior to initiation of JARDIANCE is recommended.\n- Assessment of renal function is recommended prior to initiation of JARDIANCE and periodically thereafter.\n- JARDIANCE should not be initiated in patients with an eGFR less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m2.\n\n【4】 ### DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS\n- JARDIANCE (empagliflozin) 10 mg tablets are pale yellow, round, biconvex and bevel-edged, film-coated tablets debossed with “S 10” on one side and the Boehringer Ingelheim company symbol on the other side.\n\n【5】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Empagliflozin in adult patients.\n\n【6】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Empagliflozin in adult patients.\n\n【7】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Pediatric)\nThere is limited information regarding FDA-Labeled Use of Empagliflozin in pediatric patients.\n\n【8】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Empagliflozin in pediatric patients.\n\n【9】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Empagliflozin in pediatric patients.\n\n【10】 #Contraindications\n- History of serious hypersensitivity to JARDIANCE.\n- Severe renal impairment, end-stage renal disease, or dialysis\n\n【11】 - JARDIANCE causes intravascular volume contraction. Symptomatic hypotension may occur after initiating JARDIANCE particularly in patients with renal impairment, the elderly, in patients with low systolic blood pressure, and in patients on diuretics. Before initiating JARDIANCE, assess for volume contraction and correct volume status if indicated. Monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension after initiating therapy and increase monitoring in clinical situations where volume contraction is expected .\n- Insulin and insulin secretagogues are known to cause hypoglycemia. The risk of hypoglycemia is increased when JARDIANCE is used in combination with insulin secretagogues (e.g. sulfonylurea) or insulin. Therefore, a lower dose of the insulin secretagogue or insulin may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with JARDIANCE.\n- JARDIANCE increases the risk for genital mycotic infections. Patients with a history of chronic or recurrent genital mycotic infections were more likely to develop mycotic genital infections. Monitor and treat as appropriate.\n- JARDIANCE increases the risk for urinary tract infections. Monitor and treat as appropriate.\n- Increases in LDL-C can occur with JARDIANCE. Monitor and treat as appropriate.\n- There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with JARDIANCE or any other antidiabetic drug.\n\n【12】 ## Clinical Trials Experience\n- The following important adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the labeling:\n- Hypotension\n- Impairment in Renal Function\n- Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues\n- Genital Mycotic Infections\n- Urinary Tract Infections\n- Increased Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C)\n- Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.\nJARDIANCE was used as monotherapy in one trial and as add-on therapy in four trials .\n- These data reflect exposure of 1976 patients to JARDIANCE with a mean exposure duration of approximately 23 weeks. Patients received placebo (N=995), JARDIANCE 10 mg (N=999), or JARDIANCE 25 mg (N=977) once daily. The mean age of the population was 56 years and 3% were older than 75 years of age. More than half (55%) of the population was male; 46% were White, 50% were Asian, and 3% were Black or African American. At baseline, 57% of the population had diabetes more than 5 years and had a mean hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of 8%. Established microvascular complications of diabetes at baseline included diabetic nephropathy (7%), retinopathy (8%), or neuropathy (16%). Baseline renal function was normal or mildly impaired in 91% of patients and moderately impaired in 9% of patients (mean eGFR 86.8 mL/min/1.73 m2).\nThe adverse reactions were not present at baseline, occurred more commonly on JARDIANCE than on placebo and occurred in greater than or equal to 2% of patients treated with JARDIANCE 10 mg or JARDIANCE 25 mg.\n- Thirst (including polydipsia) was reported in 0%, 1.7%, and 1.5% for placebo, JARDIANCE 10 mg, and JARDIANCE 25 mg, respectively.\n- JARDIANCE causes an osmotic diuresis, which may lead to intravascular volume contraction and adverse reactions related to volume depletion. In the pool of five placebo-controlled clinical trials, adverse reactions related to volume depletion (e.g. blood pressure (ambulatory) decreased, blood pressure systolic decreased, dehydration, hypotension, hypovolemia, orthostatic hypotension, and syncope) were reported by 0.3%, 0.5%, and 0.3% of patients treated with placebo, JARDIANCE 10 mg, and JARDIANCE 25 mg respectively. JARDIANCE may increase the risk of hypotension in patients at risk for volume contraction.\n- In the pool five placebo-controlled clinical trials, adverse reactions of increased urination (e.g. polyuria, pollakiuria, and nocturia) occurred more frequently on JARDIANCE than on placebo . Specifically, nocturia was reported by 0.4%, 0.3%, and 0.8% of patients treated with placebo, JARDIANCE 10 mg, and JARDIANCE 25 mg, respectively.\n- Use of JARDIANCE was associated with increases in serum creatinine and decreases in eGFR . Patients with moderate renal impairment at baseline had larger mean changes.\nThe incidence of hypoglycemia increased when JARDIANCE was administered with insulin or sulfonylurea - Genital mycotic infections occurred more frequently in female than male patients .\n- Phimosis occurred more frequently in male patients treated with JARDIANCE 10 mg (less than 0.1%) and JARDIANCE 25 mg (0.1%) than placebo (0%).\n- Urinary tract infections occurred more frequently in female patients. The incidence of urinary tract infections in female patients randomized to placebo, JARDIANCE 10 mg, and JARDIANCE 25 mg was 16.6%, 18.4%, and 17.0%, respectively. The incidence of urinary tract infections in male patients randomized to placebo, JARDIANCE 10 mg, and JARDIANCE 25 mg was 3.2%, 3.6%, and 4.1%, respectively .\n- Dose-related increases in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were observed in patients treated with JARDIANCE. LDL-C increased by 2.3%, 4.6%, and 6.5% in patients treated with placebo, JARDIANCE 10 mg, and JARDIANCE 25 mg, respectively. The range of mean baseline LDL-C levels was 90.3 to 90.6 mg/dL across treatment groups.\n- Increase in Hematocrit\n\n【13】 ## Postmarketing Experience\nThere is limited information regarding Postmarketing Experience of Empagliflozin in the drug label.\n\n【14】 #Drug Interactions\n- Coadministration of empagliflozin with diuretics resulted in increased urine volume and frequency of voids, which might enhance the potential for volume depletion .\n- Monitoring glycemic control with urine glucose tests is not recommended in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors as SGLT2 inhibitors increase urinary glucose excretion and will lead to positive urine glucose tests. Use alternative methods to monitor glycemic control.\n\n【15】 ### Pregnancy\nPregnancy Category (FDA): C\n- There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of JARDIANCE in pregnant women. JARDIANCE should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\n- Based on results from animal studies, empagliflozin may affect renal development and maturation. In studies conducted in rats, empagliflozin crosses the placenta and reaches fetal tissues. During pregnancy, consider appropriate alternative therapies, especially during the second and third trimesters.\n- Empagliflozin was not teratogenic in embryo-fetal development studies in rats and rabbits up to 300 mg/kg/day, which approximates 48-times and 128-times, respectively, the maximum clinical dose of 25 mg. At higher doses, causing maternal toxicity, malformations of limb bones increased in fetuses at 700 mg/kg/day or 154 times the 25 mg maximum clinical dose in rats. In the rabbit, higher doses of empagliflozin resulted in maternal and fetal toxicity at 700 mg/kg/day, or 139 times the 25 mg maximum clinical dose.\n- In pre- and postnatal development studies in pregnant rats, empagliflozin was administered from gestation day 6 through to lactation day 20 (weaning) at up to 100 mg/kg/day (approximately 16 times the 25 mg maximum clinical dose) without maternal toxicity. Reduced body weight was observed in the offspring at greater than or equal to 30 mg/kg/day (approximately 4 times the 25 mg maximum clinical dose).\n- Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) Pregnancy Category\nThere is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Empagliflozin in women who are pregnant.\n\n【16】 ### Labor and Delivery\nThere is no FDA guidance on use of Empagliflozin during labor and delivery.\n\n【17】 ### Nursing Mothers\nIt is not known if JARDIANCE is excreted in human milk. Empagliflozin is secreted in the milk of lactating rats reaching levels up to 5 times higher than that in maternal plasma. Since human kidney maturation occurs in utero and during the first 2 years of life when lactational exposure may occur, there may be risk to the developing human kidney. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from JARDIANCE, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue JARDIANCE, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\n\n【18】 ### Pediatric Use\nThe safety and effectiveness of JARDIANCE in pediatric patients under 18 years of age have not been established.\n\n【19】 ### Geriatic Use\n- No JARDIANCE dosage change is recommended based on age. A total of 2721 (32%) patients treated with empagliflozin were 65 years of age and older, and 491 (6%) were 75 years of age and older. JARDIANCE is expected to have diminished efficacy in elderly patients with renal impairment . The risk of volume depletion-related adverse reactions increased in patients who were 75 years of age and older to 2.1%, 2.3%, and 4.4% for placebo, JARDIANCE 10 mg, and JARDIANCE 25 mg. The risk of urinary tract infections increased in patients who were 75 years of age and older to 10.5%, 15.7%, and 15.1% in patients randomized to placebo, JARDIANCE 10 mg, and JARDIANCE 25 mg, respectively\n\n【20】 ### Gender\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Empagliflozin with respect to specific gender populations.\n\n【21】 ### Race\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Empagliflozin with respect to specific racial populations.\n\n【22】 ### Renal Impairment\n- The efficacy and safety of JARDIANCE were evaluated in a study of patients with mild and moderate renal impairment . In this study, 195 patients exposed to JARDIANCE had an eGFR between 60 and 90 mL/min/1.73 m2, 91 patients exposed to JARDIANCE had an eGFR between 45 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and 97 patients exposed to JARDIANCE had an eGFR between 30 and 45 mL/min/1.73 m2. The glucose lowering benefit of JARDIANCE 25 mg decreased in patients with worsening renal function. The risks of renal impairment , volume depletion adverse reactions and urinary tract infection-related adverse reactions increased with worsening renal function.\n- The efficacy and safety of JARDIANCE have not been established in patients with severe renal impairment, with ESRD, or receiving dialysis. JARDIANCE is not expected to be effective in these patient populations\n\n【23】 ### Hepatic Impairment\n- JARDIANCE may be used in patients with hepatic impairment\n\n【24】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Empagliflozin in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n\n【25】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\nThere is no FDA guidance one the use of Empagliflozin in patients who are immunocompromised.\n\n【26】 ### Administration\n- Oral\n\n【27】 ### Monitoring\nThere is limited information regarding Monitoring of Empagliflozin in the drug label.\n\n【28】 #IV Compatibility\nThere is limited information regarding IV Compatibility of Empagliflozin in the drug label.\n\n【29】 #Overdosage\n- In the event of an overdose with JARDIANCE, contact the Poison Control Center. Employ the usual supportive measures (e.g. remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring, and institute supportive treatment) as dictated by the patient’s clinical status. Removal of empagliflozin by hemodialysis has not been studied.\n\n【30】 ## Mechanism of Action\n- Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) is the predominant transporter responsible for reabsorption of glucose from the glomerular filtrate back into the circulation. Empagliflozin is an inhibitor of SGLT2. By inhibiting SGLT2, empagliflozin reduces renal reabsorption of filtered glucose and lowers the renal threshold for glucose, and thereby increases urinary glucose excretion.\n\n【31】 ## Structure\n- JARDIANCE tablets contain empagliflozin, an orally-active inhibitor of the sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2).\n- The chemical name of empagliflozin is D-Glucitol,1,5-anhydro-1-C-4-chloro-3-4-(3S)-tetrahydro-3-furanyloxyphenylmethylphenyl-,(1S).\n- Its molecular formula is C23H27ClO7 and the molecular weight is 450.91. The structural formula is:\n\n【32】 ## Pharmacodynamics\n- In patients with type 2 diabetes, urinary glucose excretion increased immediately following a dose of JARDIANCE and was maintained at the end of a 4-week treatment period averaging at approximately 64 grams per day with 10 mg empagliflozin and 78 grams per day with 25 mg JARDIANCE once daily.\n- In a 5-day study, mean 24-hour urine volume increase from baseline was 341 mL on Day 1 and 135 mL on Day 5 of empagliflozin 25 mg once daily treatment.\n\n【33】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n- The pharmacokinetics of empagliflozin has been characterized in healthy volunteers and patients with type 2 diabetes and no clinically relevant differences were noted between the two populations. After oral administration, peak plasma concentrations of empagliflozin were reached at 1.5 hours post-dose. Thereafter, plasma concentrations declined in a biphasic manner with a rapid distribution phase and a relatively slow terminal phase. The steady state mean plasma AUC and Cmax were 1870 nmol·h/L and 259 nmol/L, respectively, with 10 mg empagliflozin once daily treatment, and 4740 nmol·h/L and 687 nmol/L, respectively, with 25 mg empagliflozin once daily treatment. Systemic exposure of empagliflozin increased in a dose-proportional manner in the therapeutic dose range. The single-dose and steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters of empagliflozin were similar, suggesting linear pharmacokinetics with respect to time.\n- Administration of 25 mg empagliflozin after intake of a high-fat and high-calorie meal resulted in slightly lower exposure; AUC decreased by approximately 16% and Cmax decreased by approximately 37%, compared to fasted condition. The observed effect of food on empagliflozin pharmacokinetics was not considered clinically relevant and empagliflozin may be administered with or without food.\n- The apparent steady-state volume of distribution was estimated to be 73.8 L based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis. Following administration of an oral -empagliflozin solution to healthy subjects, the red blood cell partitioning was approximately 36.8% and plasma protein binding was 86.2%.\n- No major metabolites of empagliflozin were detected in human plasma and the most abundant metabolites were three glucuronide conjugates (2-O-, 3-O-, and 6-O-glucuronide). Systemic exposure of each metabolite was less than 10% of total drug-related material. In vitro studies suggested that the primary route of metabolism of empagliflozin in humans is glucuronidation by the uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferases UGT2B7, UGT1A3, UGT1A8, and UGT1A9.\n- In subjects with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment according to the Child-Pugh classification, AUC of empagliflozin increased by approximately 23%, 47%, and 75%, and Cmax increased by approximately 4%, 23%, and 48%, respectively, compared to subjects with normal hepatic function.\n- Based on the population PK analysis, age, body mass index (BMI), gender and race (Asians versus primarily Whites) do not have a clinically meaningful effect on pharmacokinetics of empagliflozin .\n- Studies characterizing the pharmacokinetics of empagliflozin in pediatric patients have not been performed.\n- In vitro Assessment of Drug Interactions\n- In vitro data suggest that the primary route of metabolism of empagliflozin in humans is glucuronidation by the uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferases UGT2B7, UGT1A3, UGT1A8, and UGT1A9. Empagliflozin does not inhibit, inactivate, or induce CYP450 isoforms. Empagliflozin also does not inhibit UGT1A1. Therefore, no effect of empagliflozin is anticipated on concomitantly administered drugs that are substrates of the major CYP450 isoforms or UGT1A1. The effect of UGT induction (e.g. induction by rifampicin or any other UGT enzyme inducer) on empagliflozin exposure has not been evaluated.\n- Empagliflozin is a substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), but it does not inhibit these efflux transporters at therapeutic doses. Based on in vitro studies, empagliflozin is considered unlikely to cause interactions with drugs that are P-gp substrates. Empagliflozin is a substrate of the human uptake transporters OAT3, OATP1B1, and OATP1B3, but not OAT1 and OCT2. Empagliflozin does not inhibit any of these human uptake transporters at clinically relevant plasma concentrations and, therefore, no effect of empagliflozin is anticipated on concomitantly administered drugs that are substrates of these uptake transporters.\n- Empagliflozin had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of metformin, glimepiride, pioglitazone, sitagliptin, linagliptin, warfarin, digoxin, ramipril, simvastatin, hydrochlorothiazide, torasemide, and oral contraceptives when coadministered in healthy volunteers .\n\n【34】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\n- Carcinogenesis was evaluated in 2-year studies conducted in CD-1 mice and Wistar rats. Empagliflozin did not increase the incidence of tumors in female rats dosed at 100, 300, or 700 mg/kg/day (up to 72 times the exposure from the maximum clinical dose of 25 mg). In male rats, hemangiomas of the mesenteric lymph node were increased significantly at 700 mg/kg/day or approximately 42 times the exposure from a 25 mg clinical dose. Empagliflozin did not increase the incidence of tumors in female mice dosed at 100, 300, or 1000 mg/kg/day (up to 62 times the exposure from a 25 mg clinical dose). Renal tubule adenomas and carcinomas were observed in male mice at 1000 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 45 times the exposure of the maximum clinical dose of 25 mg.\n- Empagliflozin was not mutagenic or clastogenic with or without metabolic activation in the in vitro Ames bacterial mutagenicity assay, the in vitro L5178Y tk+/- mouse lymphoma cell assay, and an in vivo micronucleus assay in rats.\n\n【35】 #Clinical Studies\n- JARDIANCE has been studied as monotherapy and in combination with metformin, sulfonylurea, pioglitazone, and insulin. JARDIANCE has also been studied in patients with type 2 diabetes with mild or moderate renal impairment.\n- In patients with type 2 diabetes, treatment with JARDIANCE reduced hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), compared to placebo. The reduction in HbA1c for JARDIANCE compared with placebo was observed across subgroups including gender, race, geographic region, baseline BMI and duration of disease.\n- A total of 986 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of JARDIANCE monotherapy.\n- Treatment-naïve patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes entered an open-label placebo run-in for 2 weeks\n- At Week 24, treatment with JARDIANCE 10 mg or 25 mg daily provided statistically significant reductions in HbA1c (p-value <0.0001), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and body weight compared with placebo .\n- Add-On Combination Therapy with Metformin\n- Active-Controlled Study versus Glimepiride in Combination with Metformin\n- The efficacy of JARDIANCE was evaluated in a double-blind, glimepiride-controlled, study in 1545 patients with type 2 diabetes with insufficient glycemic control despite metformin therapy.\n- Patients with inadequate glycemic control and an HbA1c between 7% and 10% after a 2-week run-in period were randomized to glimepiride or JARDIANCE 25 mg.\n- At Week 52, JARDIANCE 25 mg and glimepiride lowered HbA1c and FPG . The difference in observed effect size between JARDIANCE 25 mg and glimepiride excluded the pre-specified non-inferiority margin of 0.3%. The mean daily dose of glimepiride was 2.7 mg and the maximal approved dose in the United States is 8 mg per day.\n- Patients entered a 2-week placebo run-in period on basal insulin (e.g. insulin glargine, insulin detemir, or NPH insulin) with or without metformin and/or sulfonylurea background therapy. Following the run-in period, patients with inadequate glycemic control were randomized to the addition of JARDIANCE 10 mg, JARDIANCE 25 mg, or placebo. Patients were maintained on a stable dose of insulin prior to enrollment, during the run-in period, and during the first 18 weeks of treatment. For the remaining 60 weeks, insulin could be adjusted. The mean total daily insulin dose at baseline for JARDIANCE 10 mg, 25 mg, and placebo was 45 IU, 48 IU, and 48 IU, respectively.\n- A total of 738 patients with type 2 diabetes and a baseline eGFR less than 90 mL/min/1.73 m2 participated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group to evaluate the efficacy and safety of JARDIANCE in patients with type 2 diabetes and renal impairment. The trial population comprised of 290 patients with mild renal impairment (eGFR 60 to less than 90 mL/min/1.73 m2), 374 patients with moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2), and 74 with severe renal impairment (eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2). A total of 194 patients with moderate renal impairment had a baseline eGFR of 30 to less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 and 180 patients a baseline eGFR of 45 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2.\n- The glucose lowering efficacy of JARDIANCE 25 mg decreased with decreasing level of renal function in the mild to moderate range. Least square mean Hb1Ac changes at 24 weeks were -0.6%, -0.5%, and -0.2% for those with a baseline eGFR of 60 to less than 90 mL/min/1.73 m2, 45 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, and 30 to less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively . For placebo, least square mean HbA1c changes at 24 weeks were 0.1%, -0.1%, and 0.2% for patients with a baseline eGFR of 60 to less than 90 mL/min/1.73 m2, 45 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, and 30 to less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively.\n- For patients with severe renal impairment, the analyses of changes in HbA1c and FPG showed no discernible treatment effect of JARDIANCE 25 mg compared to placebo\n\n【36】 #How Supplied\n- JARDIANCE tablets are available in 10 mg and 25 mg strengths as follows:\n10 mg tablets: pale yellow, round, biconvex and bevel-edged, film-coated tablets debossed with “S 10” on one side and the Boehringer Ingelheim company symbol on the other side.\n\n【37】 Dispense in a well-closed container as defined in the USP.\n\n【38】 ## Storage\n- Store at 25°C (77°F); excursions permitted to 15°-30°C (59°-86°F)\n\n【39】 ### PATIENT PACKAGE INSERT\nPATIENT INFORMATION\nJARDIANCE (jar DEE ans)\n(empagliflozin)\nTablets\nRead this Patient Information before you start taking JARDIANCE and each time you get a refill.

This involves inserting an endoscope (a thin, rigid tube with a camera on the end) through the mouth, and using a carbon dioxide laser to cut through the muscle that runs round the top of the gullet.\n\n【2】 #Recommendations\nCurrent evidence on the safety and efficacy of endoscopic carbon dioxide laser cricopharyngeal myotomy for relief of oropharyngeal dysphagia is inadequate in quantity and quality. Therefore, this procedure should only be used with special arrangements for clinical governance, consent and audit or research.\nClinicians wishing to do endoscopic carbon dioxide laser cricopharyngeal myotomy for relief of oropharyngeal dysphagia should:\nInform the clinical governance leads in their NHS trusts.\nEnsure that patients understand the uncertainty about the procedure's safety and efficacy and provide them with clear written information. In addition, the use of NICE's information for the public is recommended.\nAudit and review clinical outcomes of all patients having endoscopic carbon dioxide laser cricopharyngeal myotomy for relief of oropharyngeal dysphagia .\nPatient selection for endoscopic carbon dioxide laser cricopharyngeal myotomy should be done by a multidisciplinary team that specialises in managing oropharyngeal dysphagia.\nFurther research on endoscopic carbon dioxide laser cricopharyngeal myotomy for relief of oropharyngeal dysphagia could include the publication of collaborative audit data. Reports should separate outcomes for different groups of patients; in particular for patients with primary neuromuscular dysfunction alone, those with associated phargyngeal diverticula and those with dysphagia caused by radiotherapy. Outcome measures should include dysphagia scores, quality of life, long‑term outcomes and the need for further treatment. All complications should be reported. NICE may update this guidance on publication of further evidence\n\n【3】 #Indications and current treatments\nCricopharyngeal (CP) muscle dysfunction, also known as dysfunction of the upper oesophageal sphincter, occurs when the CP sphincter muscle fails to relax and open during swallowing. This may be caused by muscular or degenerative neurological disorders, or after head and neck surgery, or it may be idiopathic. Symptoms of CP muscle dysfunction include difficulty swallowing, painful swallowing, choking, regurgitation, cough, aspiration and weight loss.\nTreatment for CP muscle dysfunction includes procedures such as swallowing rehabilitation therapy and dilatation of the oesophagus, and medical management with muscle relaxants or botulinum toxin injections. If symptoms persist, open surgery through a neck incision (transcervical CP myotomy) may be done. Endoscopic CP myotomy using diathermy, laser (such as carbon dioxide or potassium titanyl phosphate laser) or stapling techniques, is a less invasive alternative to open surgery\n\n【4】 #The procedure\nEndoscopic carbon dioxide laser cricopharyngeal myotomy for relief of oropharyngeal dysphagia divides the cricopharyngeal muscle via an endoscope using a carbon dioxide laser, as an alternative to open surgery.\nThe procedure is done with the patient in the supine position, usually under general anaesthesia. A rigid endoscope is introduced through the mouth, to visualise the cricopharyngeal muscle, which forms the upper oesophageal sphincter. The posterior wall of the junction between the pharynx and oesophagus, at the level of cricopharyngeal muscle, is visualised. A carbon dioxide laser (set in continuous wave mode), connected to a microscope and targeted with a micromanipulator, is used to transect the mucosa and then the deeper muscle layers, in the midline, down to the prevertebral fascia. If there is a tight stenosis, due to contracture or fibrosis of the cricopharyngeal muscle, then dilatation may be needed before myotomy to allow adequate access for the laser. Some authors recommend sealing the surgical site with fibrin glue or closure of the mucosal edges with sutures. After the procedure the patient does not eat or drink for at least 24 hours. Antibiotics are given and postoperative swallow studies are performed on day 1. If no leaks are observed, patients are allowed to drink clear fluids initially, progressing to unrestricted liquids or soft diet for a few days, and then a normal diet.\nThis procedure has been used for patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia with a number of underlying causes. This guidance addresses the use of this procedure for patients with cricopharyngeal muscle dysfunction and not for those with Zenker's diverticulum\n\n【5】 #Efficacy\nHowever, it does include mixed‑case series that included some patients with Zenker's diverticulum.\nA case series of 87 patients with cricopharyngeal (CP) muscle dysfunction from a variety of causes, treated by carbon dioxide (CO2) laser CP myotomy, reported that the average Functional Outcome Swallowing Scale (FOSS) scores (on a scale 0–5, higher scores indicating non‑oral feeding) improved from 2.6 to 1.6 (p<0.001) after surgery (timing not reported). A retrospective comparative case series of 22 patients comparing CO2 laser CP myotomy (n=14) against transcervical CP myotomy (n=8) reported that the mean functional outcomes (FOSS scores) improved after the procedure in both groups (CO2 laser group improved from 2.4 to 0.9; transcervical group from 3.4 to 1.9, p values not reported).\nA case series of 10 patients with dysphagia secondary to cricopharyngeal stricture after chemoradiation for squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, treated by CO2 laser CP myotomy reported improvement in dysphagia (assessed by modified Barium Swallow study) and radiographic resolution of the cricopharyngeal stricture in 90% (9/10) of patients.\nThe case series of 87 patients with cricopharyngeal dysfunction treated by endoscopic CO2 laser myotomy reported recurrence of dysphagia in 14% (12/87) of patients (timings not reported). All patients needed subsequent surgical procedures: 5 were treated by oesophageal dilation, 6 by repeat CO2 laser cricopharyngeal myotomy and one patient had several laser procedures and dilatations. A retrospective comparative case series of 153 patients who had endoscopic cricopharyngeal myotomy by either CO2 laser (n=123) or by stapler (n=23) reported that symptom recurrence was more frequent after the stapling procedure (CO2 laser group 6% (7/153), stapler group 26% (6/23); p=0.002). The rates of revision surgery were similar in the 2 groups (CO2 laser group 3% (4/123), stapler group 4% (1/23); p=0.77).\nThe specialist advisers listed key efficacy outcomes as improved swallowing and nutritional state, reduced number of aspirations and chest infections, reduced length of stay in hospital, improved patient‑reported quality of life measures (for example FOSS, EUR‑QoL), and changes in modified barium swallow study, videofluoroscopy or manometry\n\n【6】 #Safety\nOesophageal perforations were reported in 5% (2/44) of patients in a case series of 44 patients. Both perforations were drained externally, and the patients were given systemic antibiotics, leading to full recovery and improved swallowing.

{"seq_id": "4375b3e8-00b5-4ea6-a56b-616effef3d04", "title": null, "text": "【0】 Chronophobia\n\n【1】 #Overview\nChronophobia is described by Pamela Lee as the fear of time. There are three categories of phobia including agoraphobia, social phobia, and specific phobias which includes spiders, snakes, dogs, water, and heights. Rosemary Stolz states that chronophobia falls under the category of specific phobia because time is a specific object that one can fear.  Chronophobia is especially common in prison inmates and the elderly, but it can manifest in any person who has an extreme amount of stress and anxiety in their life.\n\n【2】 #Etymology\nChronophobia is a Greek word coming from “chronos” meaning time, and “phobos” meaning fear.  It is based on chronoperception, the process where time is perceived by the central nervous system.\n\n【3】 #Causes and contributing factors\nIn the book Chronophobia: On Time in the Art of the 1960s by Pamela Lee, Chronophobia is described as “an experience of unease and anxiety about time, a feeling that events are moving too fast and are thus hard to make sense of.” In Peter PaulAnnas Lichtenstein's review he reveals it can be caused by a traumatic experience in one's childhood, genetics, incarceration, or old age. Most traumatic experiences can lead to personal withdrawals from one's surroundings such as dissociation, depersonalization, or derealisation. A person may be genetically affected after the traumatic experience due to Adrenal insufficiency. Those with these insufficiencies are more susceptible to anxiety and fear. When people are incarcerated, they experience a heightened sense of anxiety. The stress of prison makes inmates especially at risk. Inmates start to contemplate time extensively because they are incarcerated for a certain amount of time. It is not uncommon for prison inmates to count-down the days until their release. The elderly also exhibit more of a risk because they feel that death is closer than it had ever been before in their life. The threat of death can cause an overwhelming sensation of chronophobia.\n\n【4】 #Basic symptoms\nThe three main symptoms of chronophobia, and most phobias, are panic, anxiety, and claustrophobia. In some more serious cases, individuals can experience shaking, shortness of breath, excessive sweating, and irregular heartbeats. In the most serious cases individuals can exhibit symptoms of sickening states of mind, inability to articulate words, tunnel vision, and overwhelmingly haunting thoughts.\n\n【5】 #Treatments\nMozhi Mani suggests that while no treatment has effectively cured chronophobia, certain methods may ease the individual's mind.\nOne of these treatments is hypnotherapy.  It is a method that has been considered simple and effective by the American Medical Association since 1958. It involves using hypnosis to open the subconscious mind and change the behavioral patterns of the individual with the phobia.\nArne Ohman and Susan Mineka suggest another treatment that involves Neuro-Linguistic Programming.  This method involves the use of psychotherapy to discover how people can create their own reality. A specialist can train a person to “remodel their thoughts and mental associations in order to fix  preconceived notions.” Energy (esotericism) can provide treatment for those affected. Such techniques as acupuncture, yoga, t'ai chi ch'uan, pranayama, and energy medicine may prove useful. These practices can cure nausea and may provide some sense of security to those dealing with panic and fear.\nThere are some medications that can be taken to calm the nerves of those suffering from chronophobia. These prescriptions may cause side effects and do not erase fear but merely suppress symptoms.\nA person may also wish to see a psychiatrist. Lloyd Williams assures that psychiatrists may be helpful because they serve as a medium for the patient to express their psychological problems, but without their own desire to overcome fear, the patient may not yield the intended results.\n\n【6】 #The affected\nTwo main groups are affected by chronophobia. These groups involve prison inmates and the elderly.\nOften referred to as Prison Neurosis, chronophobia can affect the incarcerated. Because of the length of time prison inmates spend in their cells, and because of the confined space that they share with others, they can develop psychological symptoms of chronophobia. Some symptoms include delusions, dissatisfaction with life, claustrophobia, depression, and feelings of panic and madness.\nThe elderly show these symptoms of chronophobia as well. When they feel that their lives are near to the end, they start to fear time because it threatens their existence. This fear is similar to chronoperception because it includes the idea that the speed of brain function depends on the metabolic rate in the hypothalamus. As people get older, their metabolism slows. The elderly may believe that as a result of their slowing metabolism, their brains do not function as well, which makes them more chronophobic.\n\n【7】 #In literature\nIn her work Chronophobia: On Time in the Art of the 1960s, Pamela Lee studies art and technology in the 1960s. Within this period, such artists as Bridget Riley, Carolee Schneemann, Jean Tinguely, Andy Warhol, and On Kawara pique her interest. She “identifies an experience of time common to both , and she calls this experience 'chronophobia'.”  After studying Michael Fried's essay Art and Objecthood, she discovers that as time goes by, art starts to reflect the quickness of time She *claims that “the concept of time they espouse is chronophobic as defined in her book, and their popularity means that their concept of time was widely shared.” In her work she fears “perpetual presentness,  time is constant without conclusion.” Many chronophobes feel this way, they fear the fact that time is never ending.\nChronophobic characters are seen in Jerzy Kosinski's Being There. The character Chance Gardiner has no sense of time because he was raised watching television and now defines time in terms of technology. He is described as being in a state of “perpetual nowness.” He has no sense of the past or future, but lives only in the moment. Kosinski explains that the only way for Chance to overcome his chronophobia is if “peace filled his chest.” Kosinski believes that chronophobia “negates the possibility of full human development.”\nThomas Pynchon offers another view of chronophobia in his novel The Crying of Lot 49. The character Oedipa is similar to Chance Gardiner because she lacks dimension, but she is able to distinguish that events have occurred in the past, present or future. Her cure for chronophobia is to create a world where events are scrambled together randomly. Time becomes irrelevant to her.\nPerhaps the most recognized literary work dealing with chronophobia lies in the story of Rip Van Winkle by Washington Irving.  This tall-tale introduces a man that has slept for 20 years and wakes to a completely new society. His wife and friends have died, his dog is missing and his gun is rusty. The fact that his entire world has changed sends him into a feeling of fear and panic. At first he is confused and lost, but his chronophobia is cured when he realizes that although it seems that everything around him has changed, his core beliefs still exist. In this instance, chronophobia is overcome because Rip Van Winkle is able to make new friends, and regain parts of the life he lost while he was asleep.\n\n【8】 #Prevention\nChronophobia can never really be prevented because it is normally caused by a traumatic experience that is not within one's power to stop. Some ways to relieve the stress that chronophobia can cause are to prevent anxiety or situations that could cause anxiety, to avoid getting stressed out about time, to be on time, and to participate in an activity that requires meditation, such as yoga or other forms of mild martial arts.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

DUAVEE may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus\n\n【9】 ### Precautions\n- Drugs Containing Progestins, Estrogens or Estrogen Agonist/Antagonists\n- DUAVEE contains conjugated estrogens and bazedoxifene, an estrogen agonist/antagonist. Women taking DUAVEE should not take progestins, additional estrogens or additional estrogen agonist/antagonists.\n- Cardiovascular Disorders\n- Estrogen agonist/antagonists (including bazedoxifene, a component of DUAVEE) and estrogens individually are known to increase the risk of VTE.\n- An increased risk of stroke and DVT has been reported with estrogen-alone therapy. Should any of these occur or be suspected, DUAVEE should be discontinued immediately.\n- Risk factors for arterial vascular disease (for example, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, tobacco use, hypercholesterolemia, and obesity) and/or VTE (for example, personal history or family history of VTE, obesity, and systemic lupus erythematosus) should be managed appropriately.\n- Stroke\n- In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, a statistically significant increased risk of stroke was reported in women 50 to 79 years of age receiving daily conjugated estrogens (CE) (0.625 mg)-alone compared to women in the same age group receiving placebo (45 versus 33 per 10,000 women-years). The increase in risk was demonstrated in year 1 and persisted .\n- Subgroup analyses of women 50 to 59 years of age suggest no increased risk of stroke for those women receiving conjugated estrogens (0.625 mg)-alone versus those receiving placebo (18 versus 21 per 10,000 women-years).\n- Should a stroke occur or be suspected, DUAVEE should be discontinued immediately.\n- Coronary Heart Disease\n- Venous Thromboembolism (VTE)\n- If feasible, DUAVEE should be discontinued at least 4 to 6 weeks before surgery of the type associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, or during periods of prolonged immobilization. Because immobilization increases the risk for venous thromboembolic events independent of therapy, DUAVEE should be discontinued prior to and during prolonged immobilization (e.g. post-surgical recovery, prolonged bed rest) and DUAVEE therapy should be resumed only after the patient is fully ambulatory. In addition, women taking DUAVEE should be advised to move about periodically during travel involving prolonged immobilization.\n- Malignant Neoplasms\n- Endometrial Cancer\n- An increased risk of endometrial cancer has been reported with the use of unopposed estrogen therapy in women with a uterus. The reported endometrial cancer risk among unopposed estrogen users is about 2 to 12 times greater than in non-users, and appears dependent on duration of treatment and on estrogen dose. Most studies show no significant increased risk associated with use of estrogens for less than 1 year. The greatest risk appears associated with prolonged use, with increased risks of 15- to 24-fold for 5 to 10 years or more of treatment. This risk has been shown to persist for at least 8 to 15 years after estrogen therapy is discontinued.\n- DUAVEE contains an estrogen agonist/antagonist. This component reduces the risk of endometrial hyperplasia that can occur with the conjugated estrogens component. Endometrial hyperplasia may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. Women taking DUAVEE should not take additional estrogens as this may increase the risk of endometrial hyperplasia.\n- Clinical surveillance of all women taking DUAVEE is important. Adequate diagnostic measures, including directed or random endometrial sampling when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in postmenopausal women with undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal genital bleeding.\n- The use of estrogen-alone has been reported to result in an increase in abnormal mammograms requiring further evaluation. The effect of treatment with DUAVEE on the risk of breast cancer is unknown.\n- All women should receive yearly breast examinations by a healthcare provider and perform monthly breast self-examinations. In addition, mammography examinations should be scheduled based on patient age, risk factors, and prior mammogram results.\n- Ovarian Cancer\n- Probable Dementia - In the WHIMS estrogen-alone ancillary study of WHI, a population of 2,947 hysterectomized women 65 to 79 years of age was randomized to daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone or placebo.\n- After an average follow-up of 5.2 years, 28 women in the estrogen-alone group and 19 women in the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia. The relative risk of probable dementia for CE-alone versus placebo was 1.49 (95 percent CI, 0.83–2.66). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE-alone versus placebo was 37 versus 25 cases per 10,000 women-years.\n- Gallbladder Disease\n- Visual Abnormalities\n- Elevated Blood Pressure\n- Hypertriglyceridemia - In women with pre-existing hypertriglyceridemia, treatment with estrogens may be associated with elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis. Consider discontinuation of DUAVEE if pancreatitis occurs.\n- Hepatic Impairment and Past History of Cholestatic Jaundice\n- DUAVEE has not been studied in women with impaired liver function or past history of cholestatic jaundice.\n- Estrogens may be poorly metabolized in women with impaired liver function.\n- On average, women with hepatic impairment treated with bazedoxifene alone showed a 4.3-fold increase in overall exposures compared with controls.\n- For women with a history of cholestatic jaundice associated with past estrogen use or with pregnancy, caution should be exercised; and in the case of recurrence, DUAVEE should be discontinued. Use of DUAVEE in patients with hepatic impairment is contraindicated.\n- Hypothyroidism\n- Estrogen administration leads to increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) levels. Women with normal thyroid function can compensate for the increased TBG by making more thyroid hormone, thus maintaining free T4 and T3 serum concentrations in the normal range. Women dependent on thyroid hormone replacement therapy who are also receiving estrogens may require increased doses of their thyroid replacement therapy. These women should have their thyroid function monitored in order to maintain their free thyroid hormone levels in an acceptable range.\n- Fluid Retention\n- Hereditary Angioedema - Exogenous estrogens may exacerbate symptoms of angioedema in women with hereditary angioedema.\n- Exacerbation of Other Conditions\n- Premenopausal Women\n- Laboratory Tests\n- Serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol levels have not been shown to be useful in the management of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms.\n- Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions\n- Accelerated prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and platelet aggregation time; increased platelet count; increased factors II, VII antigen, VIII antigen, VIII coagulant activity, IX, X, XII, VII-X complex, II-VII-X complex, and beta-thromboglobulin; decreased levels of antifactor Xa and antithrombin III, decreased antithrombin III activity; increased levels of fibrinogen and fibrinogen activity; increased plasminogen antigen and activity.\n- Other binding proteins may be elevated in serum, for example, corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), leading to increased total circulating corticosteroids and sex steroids, respectively. Free hormone concentrations, such as testosterone and estradiol, may be decreased. Other plasma proteins may be increased (angiotensinogen/renin substrate, alpha-1-antitrypsin, ceruloplasmin).\n- Impaired glucose tolerance.\n\n【10】 ## Clinical Trials Experience\n- Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.\n- The safety of conjugated estrogens/bazedoxifene was evaluated in four Phase 3 clinical trials ranging from 12 weeks to 24 months in duration and enrolling 6,210 postmenopausal women age 40 to 75 years (mean age 55 years). A total of 1,224 patients were treated with DUAVEE and 1,069 patients received placebo. Women enrolled in Studies 1 and 2 received calcium (600–1200 mg) and vitamin D (200–400 IU) daily, while women in Studies 3 and 4 received no calcium and vitamin D supplementation as part of the protocol.\n\n【11】 - Venous thromboembolism: In the clinical studies with DUAVEE, the reporting rates for venous thromboembolism (deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and retinal vein thrombosis) were low in all treatment groups. Adverse reactions of venous thromboembolism were reported in 0.0% of patients treated with DUAVEE and 0.1% of patients treated with placebo. Due to the low rate of events in both groups, it is not possible to conclude that the risk of venous thromboembolism with DUAVEE is different from that seen with other estrogen therapies.\n\n【12】 ## Postmarketing Experience\nThere is limited information regarding Postmarketing Experience of Conjugated estrogens/bazedoxifene in the drug label.\n\n【13】 #Drug Interactions\n- Cytochrome P450 (CYP)\n- In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that estrogens are metabolized partially by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Therefore, inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4 may affect estrogen drug metabolism. Inducers of CYP3A4, such as St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) preparations, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, and rifampin, may reduce plasma concentrations of estrogens, possibly resulting in a decrease in therapeutic effects and/or changes in the uterine bleeding profile.\n- Bazedoxifene undergoes little or no cytochrome P450 (CYP)-mediated metabolism. Bazedoxifene does not induce or inhibit the activities of major CYP isoenzymes. In vitro data suggest that bazedoxifene is unlikely to interact with co-administered drugs via CYP-mediated metabolism.\n- Uridine Diphosphate Glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)\n- Bazedoxifene undergoes metabolism by UGT enzymes in the intestinal tract and liver. The metabolism of bazedoxifene may be increased by concomitant use of substances known to induce UGTs, such as rifampin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, and phenytoin. A reduction in bazedoxifene exposure may be associated with an increase risk of endometrial hyperplasia. Adequate diagnostic measures, including directed or random endometrial sampling when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in postmenopausal women with undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal genital bleeding.\n- Atorvastatin\n- Concomitant administration of bazedoxifene (40 mg daily) and atorvastatin (20 mg, single-dose) to healthy postmenopausal women did not affect the pharmacokinetics of bazedoxifene, atorvastatin or its active metabolites.\n\n【14】 ### Pregnancy\nPregnancy Category (FDA):\n- Pregnancy Category X\n- DUAVEE must not be used in women who are or may become pregnant.\n- No studies were performed on animals to evaluate the effects on reproduction with conjugated estrogens/bazedoxifene.\n- Administration of bazedoxifene to rats at maternally toxic dosages ≥ 1 mg/kg/day (≥ 0.3 times the human area under the curve (AUC) at the 20 mg dose) resulted in reduced numbers of live fetuses and/or reductions in fetal body weights. No fetal developmental anomalies were observed. In studies conducted with pregnant rabbits treated with bazedoxifene, abortion and an increased incidence of heart (ventricular septal defect) and skeletal system (ossification delays, misshapen or misaligned bones, primarily of the spine and skull) anomalies in the fetuses were present at maternally toxic dosages of ≥ 0.5 mg/kg/day (2 times the human AUC at the 20 mg dose).\n- Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) Pregnancy Category\nThere is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Conjugated estrogens/bazedoxifene in women who are pregnant.\n\n【15】 ### Labor and Delivery\nThere is no FDA guidance on use of Conjugated estrogens/bazedoxifene during labor and delivery.\n\n【16】 ### Nursing Mothers\n- DUAVEE should not be used by lactating women. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Detectable amounts of estrogens have been identified in the milk of mothers receiving conjugated estrogens. Estrogen administration to nursing mothers has been shown to decrease the quantity and quality of the milk.\n\n【17】 ### Pediatric Use\n- DUAVEE is not indicated for use in children.\n\n【18】 ### Geriatic Use\n- DUAVEE is not recommended for use in women greater than 75 years of age\\.\n- Of the total number of women in phase 3 clinical studies who received DUAVEE, 4.60% (n=224) were 65 years and over. DUAVEE was not studied in women aged 75 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between women 65–74 years of age and younger women, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger women, but greater sensitivity of some older women cannot be ruled out.\n- An increased risk of probable dementia in women over 65 years of age was reported in the Women's Health Initiative Memory ancillary studies of the Women's Health Initiative using daily conjugated estrogens (0.625 mg)\\.\n\n【19】 ### Gender\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Conjugated estrogens/bazedoxifene with respect to specific gender populations.\n\n【20】 ### Race\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Conjugated estrogens/bazedoxifene with respect to specific racial populations.\n\n【21】 ### Renal Impairment\n- DUAVEE is not recommended for use in patients with renal impairment.\n- The pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of DUAVEE have not been evaluated in women with renal impairment.\n\n【22】 ### Hepatic Impairment\n- DUAVEE is contraindicated in patients with hepatic impairment.\n- The pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of DUAVEE have not been evaluated in women with hepatic impairment. In a pharmacokinetics study of bazedoxifene 20 mg alone, the Cmax and AUC of bazedoxifene increased 67% and 143%, respectively, in women with mild hepatic impairment (Child Pugh Class A), compared to healthy women. The Cmax and AUC of bazedoxifene increased 32% and 109%, respectively, in women with moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh Class B). The Cmax and AUC of bazedoxifene increased 20% and 268%, respectively, in women with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh Class C).\nNo pharmacokinetic studies with conjugated estrogens were conducted in women with hepatic impairment.\n\n【23】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Conjugated estrogens/bazedoxifene in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n\n【24】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\nThere is no FDA guidance one the use of Conjugated estrogens/bazedoxifene in patients who are immunocompromised.\n\n【25】 ### Administration\n- Oral\n\n【26】 ### Monitoring\nThere is limited information regarding Monitoring of Conjugated estrogens/bazedoxifene in the drug label.\n\n【27】 #IV Compatibility\nThere is limited information regarding IV Compatibility of Conjugated estrogens/bazedoxifene in the drug label.\n\n【28】 ### Signs and Symptoms\n- Symptoms of overdosage of estrogen-containing products in adults and children may include nausea, vomiting, breast tenderness, dizziness, abdominal pain, drowsiness/fatigue; withdrawal bleeding may occur.\n\n【29】 ### Management\n- In case of overdosage, there is no specific antidote, and the treatment should be symptomatic.\n\n【30】 ## Chronic Overdose\nThere is limited information regarding Chronic Overdose of Conjugated estrogens/bazedoxifene in the drug label.\n\n【31】 #Pharmacology\nThere is limited information regarding Conjugated estrogens/bazedoxifene Pharmacology in the drug label.\n\n【32】 ## Mechanism of Action\n- DUAVEE pairs conjugated estrogens with bazedoxifene. Conjugated estrogens and bazedoxifene function by binding to and activating estrogen receptors (ER) α and β, which vary in proportion from tissue to tissue. Conjugated estrogens are composed of multiple estrogens and are agonists of ER- α and β. Bazedoxifene is an estrogen agonist/antagonist that acts as an agonist in some estrogen-sensitive tissues and an antagonist in others (e.g. uterus). The pairing of conjugated estrogens with bazedoxifene produces a composite effect that is specific to each target tissue. The bazedoxifene component reduces the risk of endometrial hyperplasia that can occur with the conjugated estrogens component.\n\n【33】 ## Structure\n- DUAVEE (conjugated estrogens/bazedoxifene), contains conjugated estrogens with bazedoxifene, an estrogen agonist/antagonist.\n- Conjugated estrogens are purified from pregnant mares' urine and consist of the sodium salts of water-soluble estrogen sulfates blended to represent the average composition of material derived from pregnant mares' urine. Conjugated estrogens are a mixture of sodium estrone sulfate and sodium equilin sulfate, and also contain as concomitant components, sodium sulfate conjugates, 17α-dihydroequilin, 17α-estradiol, and 17β-dihydroequilin.\n- Bazedoxifene is supplied as the acetate salt (bazedoxifene acetate) and has the chemical name 1H-Indol-5-ol, 1-phenylmethyl-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-methyl-, monoacetate. The empirical formula is C30H34N2O3 ∙ C2H4O2, and the molecular weight is 530.65.\n- Bazedoxifene acetate is a white to tan powder. The aqueous solubility of bazedoxifene is pH-dependent. Solubility is higher at lower pH. The solubility of bazedoxifene acetate in unbuffered sterile water was measured to be 923 μgA/mL at pH 5.4. The following represents the chemical structure of bazedoxifene acetate:\n- DUAVEE is available for oral administration as tablets containing 0.45 mg of conjugated estrogens with 20 mg of bazedoxifene (equivalent to 22.6 mg of bazedoxifene acetate). Each tablet of DUAVEE contains the following inactive ingredients: calcium phosphate tribasic, hydroxypropyl cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, powdered cellulose, hypromellose, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, polyethylene glycol, sucrose, ascorbic acid, sucrose palmitic acid ester, hydroxyethylcellulose, titanium dioxide, red iron oxide, yellow iron oxide, black iron oxide, povidone, polydextrose, maltitol, poloxamer 188, propylene glycol, and isopropyl alcohol.\n\n【34】 ## Pharmacodynamics\nThere is limited information regarding Pharmacodynamics of Conjugated estrogens/bazedoxifene in the drug label.\n\n【35】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n- Absorption\n- Following administration of multiple doses of conjugated estrogens 0\n- Results from monotherapy studies with conjugated estrogens or bazedoxifene components of DUAVEE, are noted below:\n- Conjugated estrogens are soluble in water and are well-absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after release from the drug formulation.\n- Bazedoxifene exhibits a linear increase in plasma concentrations for single doses from 0.5 mg up to 120 mg and multiple daily doses from 1 mg to 80 mg. The absolute bioavailability of bazedoxifene is approximately 6%.\n- Food Effect\n- In a single-dose, crossover study in 23 postmenopausal women given conjugated estrogens 0.625 mg/bazedoxifene 20 mg with a high fat/high calorie meal, food increased AUC0–inf of bazedoxifene by 25%. The Cmax of bazedoxifene was unchanged.\n- Distribution\n- The distribution of conjugated estrogens and bazedoxifene after administration of DUAVEE has not been studied.\n- The distribution of exogenous estrogens is similar to that of endogenous estrogens. Estrogens are widely distributed in the body and are generally found in higher concentrations in the sex hormone target organs. Estrogens circulate in the blood largely bound to sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and albumin.\n- Following intravenous (IV) administration of a 3 mg dose of bazedoxifene, the volume of distribution is 14.7 ± 3.9 L/kg. Bazedoxifene is highly bound (98%–99%) to plasma proteins in vitro, but does not bind to SHBG.\n- Metabolism\n- Exogenous estrogens are metabolized in the same manner as endogenous estrogens. Circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions. 17-β estradiol is converted reversibly to estrone, and both can be converted to estriol, which is the major urinary metabolite. In postmenopausal women, a significant proportion of the circulating estrogens exists as sulfate conjugates, especially estrone sulfate, which serves as a circulating reservoir for the formation of more active estrogens.\n- Excretion\n- Use in Specific Populations\n- Pediatric\n- No pharmacokinetic studies with conjugated estrogens were conducted in specific populations, including women over 75 years of age.\n- The pharmacokinetics of a 20 mg single-dose of bazedoxifene, were evaluated in postmenopausal women. On average, compared to women 51 to 64 years of age (n=8), women 65 to 74 years of age (n=8) showed a 1.5-fold increase in AUC, and women ≥ 75 years of age (n=8) showed a 2.6-fold increase in AUC.\n- Renal Impairment\n- A single dose of bazedoxifene 20 mg was given to fasted, healthy (N=18) and hepatically impaired postmenopausal women. In six mild hepatic impairment patients (Child Pugh Class A), Cmax and AUC of bazedoxifene increased 67% and 143%, respectively, compared to healthy subjects. In six moderate hepatic impairment patients (Child Pugh Class B), Cmax and AUC of bazedoxifene increased 32% and 109%, respectively, compared to healthy subjects. In six severe hepatic impairment patients (Child Pugh Class C), Cmax and AUC of bazedoxifene increased 20% and 268%, respectively, compared to healthy subjects. Half-life was prolonged from 32 to 50 hrs in patients with severe hepatic impairment, compared to healthy subjects.\n- Drug Interactions\n- No drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with conjugated estrogens/bazedoxifene tablets.\n- Effect of Co-Administered Drugs on the Pharmacokinetics of Bazedoxifene\n- Conjugated Estrogens\n- Conjugated estrogens 0.625 mg were administered alone for 6 consecutive days prior to the co-administration of a single dose of 20 mg bazedoxifene and conjugated estrogens 0.625 mg in thirty postmenopausal women. Conjugated estrogens 0.625 mg were continued for 2 additional days after the co-administration of bazedoxifene and conjugated estrogens. The Cmax of bazedoxifene increased by 3% and AUC of bazedoxifene decreased by 6%.\n- Ibuprofen\n- Atorvastatin 20 mg was given once with bazedoxifene 40 mg in thirty postmenopausal women. Co-administration of atorvastatin and bazedoxifene decreased Cmax of bazedoxifene by 3% and increased AUC of bazedoxifene by 6%.\n- Azithromycin\n- Aluminum and Magnesium Hydroxide\n- Bazedoxifene 40 mg was given for 8 consecutive days prior to co-administration of bazedoxifene 40 mg and atorvastatin 20 mg. Co-administration of bazedoxifene and atorvastatin decreased Cmax of atorvastatin by 14%. The AUC of atorvastatin was unchanged. The Cmax and AUC of 2-OH atorvastatin were decreased by 18% and 8%, respectively.\n\n【36】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\n- Carcinogenesis - Long-term continuous administration of natural and synthetic estrogens in certain animal species increases the frequency of carcinomas of the breast, uterus, cervix, vagina, testis, and liver.\n- In 6-month oral gavage carcinogenicity studies of bazedoxifene in transgenic Tg.RasH2 mice, there was a drug-related increased incidence of benign, ovarian granulosa-cell tumors in female mice given 150 or 500 mg/kg/day. In a two-year dietary carcinogenicity study of bazedoxifene in rats (administered at 0.003%, 0.01%, 0.03%, or 0.1%) a drug-related marked increased incidence of benign, ovarian granulosa-cell tumors was observed in female rats at concentrations of 0.03% and 0.1%. Systemic exposure (AUC) of bazedoxifene in these groups was 3 and 8 times that observed in postmenopausal women administered 20 mg/day. In male rats, drug-related renal tumors (adenomas and carcinomas), in the presence of renal toxicity, were observed at all doses tested, which corresponded to exposure ratios of 0.06 to 5 times the clinical AUC at a dose of 20 mg.\n- Mutagenesis - Mutagenicity studies with conjugated estrogens/bazedoxifene have not been conducted.\n- Bazedoxifene was not genotoxic or mutagenic in a battery of tests, including in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay, in vitro mammalian cell forward mutation assay at the thymidine kinase (TK+/-) locus in L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells, in vitro chromosome aberration assay in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, and in vivo mouse micronucleus assay.\n- Impairment of Fertility\n- Female rats were administered daily dosages of 0.3 to 30 mg/kg bazedoxifene (0.03 to 10 times human AUC at the 20 mg dose) prior to and during mating with untreated males. Estrous cycles and fertility were adversely affected in all bazedoxifene-treated female groups.\n- Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology\n- In a 12-month study in ovariectomized rats, co-administration of conjugated estrogens (2.5 mg/kg/day) and bazedoxifene (0.1, 0.3, or 1 mg/kg/day) prevented the loss of bone mass at the spine, femur, and tibia with concomitant maintenance of biomechanical strength parameters.\n\n【37】 #Clinical Studies\n- The safety and efficacy of DUAVEE as a treatment for moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause was established in a 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (Study 3). Study 3 enrolled a total of 318 women, age 42–64 (mean age of 53 years), who had at least 7 moderate to severe hot flushes per day or at least 50 per week at baseline. The mean number of years since menopause was 4.5 years with all women undergoing natural menopause. A total of 127 women were assigned to DUAVEE and 63 women were assigned to placebo.\n- In Study 3, DUAVEE significantly reduced the number and severity of moderate to severe hot flushes, as measured by the daily severity score, compared with placebo at Weeks 4 and 12\n- The safety and efficacy of DUAVEE for the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis was demonstrated in Study 1 and Study 2.\n- Study 1 was a 24-month, double-blind, randomized, placebo- and active-controlled study evaluating the safety and efficacy of multiple combinations of conjugated estrogen/bazedoxifene (including conjugated estrogens 0.45 mg/bazedoxifene 20 mg) compared to placebo. The primary endpoint of the study was the incidence of endometrial hyperplasia at Year 1. Bone mineral density change at the lumbar spine at Year 2 was the key secondary endpoint, assessed in two subsets of patients (Substudy I and Substudy II). Patients enrolled into Substudy I had to be more than 5 years postmenopausal, have a lumbar spine or total hip T-score of -1 to -2.5, and have at least one additional risk factor for osteoporosis (e.g. Caucasian race, family history of osteoporosis, early menopause, thin/small frame, inactive lifestyle, tobacco abuse). Those enrolled into Substudy II had to be 1–5 years postmenopausal with at least one additional risk factor for osteoporosis. A total of 3,397 women age 40–75 (mean age of 56 years) were enrolled in the overall study. Substudy I enrolled a total of 1,454 women (182 women receiving DUAVEE) with mean baseline T-scores of -1.43 and -1.52 in the DUAVEE and placebo groups, respectively. Substudy II enrolled a total of 861 women (with 111 women receiving DUAVEE) with mean baseline T-scores of -0.81 and -0.94 in the DUAVEE and placebo groups, respectively. Women also took calcium (600–1200 mg) and vitamin D (200–400 IU) daily.\n- In these substudies, treatment with DUAVEE significantly increased lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) at 24 months compared to placebo in both groups of postmenopausal women .\n- Effects of DUAVEE on endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial malignancy were assessed in Study 1 and Study 2. The Efficacy Evaluable population included patients who had taken at least one dose of DUAVEE, had baseline and post baseline endometrial biopsies, or had been diagnosed with hyperplasia. By endometrial biopsy, the incidence of endometrial hyperplasia or malignancy for DUAVEE was below 1% in both studies .\n- Uterine bleeding or spotting were evaluated in two clinical studies (Studies 1 and 2) by daily diary. In Study 1, cumulative amenorrhea at Year 1 was 83% in women treated with DUAVEE and 85% in women who received placebo. In Study 2, cumulative amenorrhea at Year 1 was 88% in women treated with DUAVEE and 84% in women who received placebo.\n- The WHI estrogen-alone substudy was stopped early because an increased risk of stroke was observed, and it was deemed that no further information would be obtained regarding the risks and benefits of estrogen-alone in predetermined primary endpoints.\n- Results of the estrogen-alone substudy, which included 10,739 women (average 63 years of age, range 50 to 79; 75.3 percent White, 15.1 percent Black, 6.1 percent Hispanic, 3.6 percent Other), after an average follow- up of 7\n- No overall difference for primary CHD events (nonfatal MI, silent MI and CHD death) and invasive breast cancer incidence in women receiving conjugated estrogens-alone compared to placebo was reported in final centrally adjudicated results from the estrogen-alone substudy, after an average follow-up of 7.1 years.\n- Centrally adjudicated results for stroke events from the estrogen-alone substudy, after an average follow-up of 7.1 years, reported no significant differences in distribution of stroke subtype or severity, including fatal strokes, in women receiving conjugated estrogens-alone compared to placebo. Estrogen-alone increased the risk for ischemic stroke, and this excess risk was present in all subgroups of women examined.\n\n【38】 #How Supplied\n- DUAVEE tablets contain 0.45 mg conjugated estrogens and 20 mg bazedoxifene.

Common adverse reactions include diarrhea, flatulance, nausea and vomiting.\n\n【2】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Adult)\n- For therapeutic use in patients with hypokalemia with or without metabolic alkalosis; in digitalis intoxication and in patients with hypokalemic familial periodic paralysis.\n- Dosing Information\n- Dosage must be adjusted to the individual needs of each patient but is typically in the range of 40-100 mEq per day or more for the treatment of potassium depletion.\n- The usual adult dose is 20-100 mEq of potassium per day (one KLOR-CON 20 mEq packet 1 to 5 times daily after meals or one KLOR-CON /25 25 mEq packet 1 to 4 times daily after meals).\n- The contents of each KLOR-CON packet should be dissolved in at least 4 ounces of cold water or other beverage. The contents of each KLOR-CON /25 packet should be dissolved in at least 5 ounces of cold water or other beverage. These preparations, like other potassium supplements, must be properly diluted to avoid the possibility of gastrointestinal irritation.\n\n【3】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\n- There is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Potassium chloride in adult patients.\n\n【4】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n- There is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Potassium chloride in adult patients.\n\n【5】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Pediatric)\nThere is limited information regarding Potassium chloride FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Pediatric) in the drug label.\n\n【6】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\n- Developed by:\n- Class of Recommendation: Pediatric, Class IIa - Strength of Evidence: Pediatric, Category C\n- Dosing Information\n- The recommended dose of potassium chloride in children is 3 to 8 mEq/kg/day orally divided 1 to 5 times per day depending on tolerability and dose. Start at a lower dose and adjust based on serum potassium concentrations.\nSupplementation with Diuretics:\n- When potassium chloride is administered concomitantly with diuretics, the recommended oral dose of potassium chloride is 1 to 3 mEq/kg/day\n\n【7】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n- There is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Potassium chloride in pediatric patients.\n\n【8】 #Contraindications\n- Potassium supplements are contraindicated in patients with hyperkalemia since a further increase in serum potassium concentration in such patients can produce cardiac arrest. Hyperkalemia may complicate any of the following conditions: chronic renal failure, systemic acidosis such as diabetic acidosis, acute dehydration, extensive tissue breakdown as in severe burns, adrenal insufficiency, or the administration of a potassium-sparing diuretic (e.g.spironolactone, triamterene or amiloride). Contraindicated in persons demonstrating allergy to any of the components of the powder.\n\n【9】 Hyperkalemia - In patients with impaired mechanisms for excreting potassium, the administration of potassium salts can produce hyperkalemia and cardiac arrest. This occurs most commonly in patients given potassium by the intravenous route but may also occur in patients given potassium orally. Potentially fatal hyperkalemia can develop rapidly and be asymptomatic.\n- The use of potassium salts in patients with chronic renal disease, or any other condition which impairs potassium excretion, requires particularly careful monitoring of the serum potassium concentration and appropriate dosage adjustments.\nInteraction with Potassium-Sparing Diuretics\nMetabolic Acidosis - Hypokalemia in patients with metabolic acidosis should be treated with an alkalinizing potassium salt such as potassium bicarbonate, potassium citrate or potassium acetate.\n\n【10】 ### Precautions\nGeneral\n- The diagnosis of potassium depletion is ordinarily made by demonstrating hypokalemia in a patient with a clinical history suggesting some cause for potassium depletion.\nLaboratory Tests\n- In interpreting the serum potassium level, the physician should be aware that acute alkalosis per se can produce hypokalemia in the absence of a deficit in total body potassium while acute acidosis per se can increase the serum potassium concentration into the normal range even in the presence of a reduced total body potassium. The treatment of potassium depletion, particularly in the presence of cardiac disease, renal disease, or acidosis, requires careful attention to acid-base balance and appropriate monitoring of serum electrolytes, the electrocardiogram, and the clinical status of the patient.\n\n【11】 ## Clinical Trials Experience\n- There is limited information regarding Clinical Trial Experience of Potassium chloride in the drug label.\n\n【12】 ## Postmarketing Experience\n- There is limited information regarding Postmarketing Experience of Potassium chloride in the drug label\n\n【13】 #Drug Interactions\nThere is limited information regarding Potassium chloride Drug Interactions in the drug label.\n\n【14】 ### Pregnancy\nPregnancy Category (FDA): C\n- Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with potassium chloride. It is not known if potassium chloride causes fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or affects reproductive capacity. Potassium chloride should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.\n- Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) Pregnancy Category\n- There is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Potassium chloride in women who are pregnant.\n\n【15】 ### Labor and Delivery\n- There is no FDA guidance on use of Potassium chloride during labor and delivery.\n\n【16】 ### Nursing Mothers\n- Many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from oral potassium supplements, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\n\n【17】 ### Pediatric Use\n- Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.\n\n【18】 ### Geriatic Use\n- There is no FDA guidance on the use of Potassium chloride with respect to geriatric patients.\n\n【19】 ### Gender\n- There is no FDA guidance on the use of Potassium chloride with respect to specific gender populations.\n\n【20】 ### Race\n- There is no FDA guidance on the use of Potassium chloride with respect to specific racial populations.\n\n【21】 ### Renal Impairment\n- There is no FDA guidance on the use of Potassium chloride in patients with renal impairment.\n\n【22】 ### Hepatic Impairment\n- There is no FDA guidance on the use of Potassium chloride in patients with hepatic impairment.\n\n【23】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\n- There is no FDA guidance on the use of Potassium chloride in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n\n【24】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\n- There is no FDA guidance one the use of Potassium chloride in patients who are immunocompromised.\n\n【25】 ### Administration\n- Dosage must be adjusted to the individual needs of each patient but is typically in the range of 20 mEq per day for the prevention of hypokalemia to 40-100 mEq per day or more for the treatment of potassium depletion.\n- The usual adult dose is 20-100 mEq of potassium per day (one KLOR-CON 20 mEq packet 1 to 5 times daily after meals or one KLOR-CON /25 25 mEq packet 1 to 4 times daily after meals).\n- The contents of each KLOR-CON packet should be dissolved in at least 4 ounces of cold water or other beverage. The contents of each KLOR-CON /25 packet should be dissolved in at least 5 ounces of cold water or other beverage. These preparations, like other potassium supplements, must be properly diluted to avoid the possibility of gastrointestinal irritation.\n\n【26】 ### Monitoring\n- There is limited information regarding Monitoring of Potassium chloride in the drug label.\n\n【27】 #IV Compatibility\n- There is limited information regarding IV Compatibility of Potassium chloride in the drug label.\n\n【28】 #Overdosage\nThere is limited information regarding Potassium chloride overdosage\n\n【29】 ## Mechanism of Action\n- Potassium ion is the principal intracellular cation of most body tissues. Potassium ions participate in a number of essential physiological processes, including the maintenance of intracellular tonicity, the transmission of nerve impulses, the contraction of cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle and the maintenance of normal renal function.\n- Potassium depletion may occur whenever the rate of potassium loss through renal excretion and/or loss from the gastrointestinal tract exceeds the rate of potassium intake. Such depletion usually develops slowly as a consequence of prolonged therapy with oral diuretics, primary or secondary hyperaldosteronism, diabetic ketoacidosis, severe diarrhea, or inadequate replacement of potassium in patients on prolonged parenteral nutrition. Potassium depletion due to these causes is usually accompanied by a concomitant deficiency of chloride and is manifested by hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis. Potassium depletion may produce weakness, fatigue, disturbances of cardiac rhythm (primarily ectopic beats), prominent U-waves in the electro-cardiogram, and in advanced cases flaccid paralysis and/or impaired ability to concentrate urine.\n- In rare circumstances (e.g. patients with renal tubular acidosis) potassium depletion may be associated with metabolic acidosis and hyperchloremia. In such patients potassium replacement should be accomplished with potassium salts other than the chloride, such as potassium bicarbonate, potassium citrate or potassium acetate.\n\n【30】 ## Structure\n- Fruit-flavored KLOR-CON and KLOR-CON/25 Powder (Potassium Chloride for Oral Solution, USP) are oral potassium supplements offered as powder for reconstitution in individual packets. Each packet of KLOR-CON powder contains potassium 20 mEq and chloride 20 mEq provided by potassium chloride 1.5 g.

In the late stages of the condition, individuals become susceptible to opportunistic infections and neoplastic proliferation. HIV is transmitted via direct contact of an exposed mucous membrane or the bloodstream with bodily fluids (e.g. blood, semen, vaginal fluid, preseminal fluid, or breast milk) that contain HIV particles. HIV is a global pandemic; according to UNAIDS an estimated 37.9 million individuals were living with the disease in 2018. Of these, 36.2 million were adults and 1.7 million were children (< 15 years old). An estimated 1.7 million individuals worldwide became newly infected with HIV in 2018. Since the start of the epidemic until 2018, 74.9 million people have become infected with HIV and 32.0 million people have died from AIDS-related illnesses. In 2018, 79% of all people living with HIV knew their HIV status, and about 8.1 million people did not know that they were living with HIV. Although several antiretroviral treatment regimens for HIV exist, they lead to a \"functional\" cure clearing the virus from the blood. There is currently no known \"sterilizing cure\" due to the existence of a \"latent reservoir\". Still, modern antiretroviral therapy has significantly decreased the morbidity and mortality associated with the disease. There are two proven cases of HIV sterilizing cure after bone marrow transplant for cancer: the first, initially known as \"the Berlin patient\" had leukemia and was presented at the 2008 Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections. In 2010 the patient identified himself as Timothy Ray Brown; the second patient, called \"the London patient\" who had Hodgkin's lymphoma and was also submitted to bone marrow transplant, had his case presented at the same conference in 2019.\n\n【2】 #Classification\nMany definitions have been developed for epidemiological surveillance of HIV/AIDS; these include the Bangui definition and the 1994 Expanded World Health Organization AIDS Case Definition. However, these systems are neither sensitive nor specific for clinical staging. In developing countries, the World Health Organization staging system for HIV infection and disease, which uses clinical and laboratory data, is widely employed. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Classification System for HIV/AIDS is another primary system used that is chiefly based on CD4 T-lymphocyte counts. There is a further clinical differentiation between having the virus, but not the disease (HIV-positive) or having the disease (any AIDS-defining condition or a CD4+ count below 200 cells/mm3).\n\n【3】 #Pathophysiology\nHIV causes AIDS by depleting the body's supply of CD4+ T helper lymphocytes. The virus is acquired via either sexual contact, exposure to contaminated blood, or mother-to-child transmission. Once the virus is acquired, it disseminates to the majority of lymphoid organs where it enters a period of rapid viral replication. This leads to the acute phase of the infection, which is characterized by a very elevated viral titer (viral load) and an acute drop in CD4 T-lymphocyte count. As the immune response mounts, viral replication and the CD4 T cell depletion rate drops. The immune system continues to deteriorate, but at a slower pace. This is known as the chronic phase of HIV infection. The HIV virus causes CD4 T cell death through a variety of mechanisms, including cytopathic single-cell destruction, syncytia formation, autoimmunity, and superantigen formation.\n\n【4】 #Causes\nAIDS is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). HIV is a retrovirus classified into the family Retroviridae and the sub-family orthoretrovirinae, that replicate in a host cell through the process of reverse transcription, and the genus Lentivirus, which are known to cause chronic and deadly diseases characterized by long incubation periods. Two main subspecies of HIV exist: HIV-1 and HIV-2. HIV-1 is composed of two copies of single-stranded RNA enclosed by a conical capsid comprising the viral protein p24. The genome consists of several major genes that code for structural and functional proteins. These include the gag, pol, env, tat, and nef genes. Two enzymes that are critical for all retroviruses are reverse transcriptase, which transcribes the viral RNA into double-stranded DNA and integrase, which integrates this newly formed DNA into the host genome. It is a well-known fact that no two HIV genomes are the same, not even from the same person, causing some to speculate that HIV is a \"quasispecies\" of a virus.\n\n【5】 #Differentiating HIV infection and AIDS from other diseases\nAcute HIV infection may be asymptomatic or may cause a mononucleosis-like syndrome. It must be differentiated from similar diseases that cause fever, fatigue, sore throat, myalgia, and lymphadenopathy such as acute toxoplasmosis, acute CMV/EBV infections, and acute viral hepatitis. AIDS should be considered in all patients presenting with symptoms of immunodeficiency or opportunistic infections. It should be distinguished from various medical states that cause immunosuppression, including common variable immune deficiency (CVID), chemotherapy treatment, steroid therapy, and severe malnutrition.\n\n【6】 #Epidemiology and Demographics\nHIV is a global pandemic. In 2018, an estimated 37.9 million people worldwide were living with the disease. Since the start of the epidemic until 2018, 74.9 million people have become infected with HIV and 32.0 million people have died from AIDS-related illnesses, including approximately 770,000 patients, and 1.7 million people newly infected with HIV in 2018 alone. Over three-fourths of AIDS-related deaths are confined to Sub-Saharan Africa. Despite advances in antiretroviral therapy (ART) and reduction of both the mortality and the morbidity of HIV infection with regular use of these agents, routine access to ART is not available in all countries. As the end of June 2019, 24.5 million people were receiving ART in the world.\n\n【7】 #Risk Factors\nThe majority of HIV infections are acquired through unprotected sexual intercourse. The exposures with the highest risk of contracting the disease include contaminated blood transfusions, childbirth, needle sharing, and receptive anal intercourse. In 2016, needle sharing was the cause of aproximately 20% of all new HIV infections. Infectivity varies throughout the course of the disease and is closely associated with the HIV viral load.\n\n【8】 #Screening\nThe primary determinant of the morbidity and mortality of HIV infections is adequate antiretroviral therapy. For that reason, early detection is essential in improving outcomes. In 2006, the Centers for Disease Control announced an initiative for voluntary, routine testing of all Americans aged 13–64 during visits to healthcare facilities.  An estimated 25% of infected individuals were unaware of their status. Routine prenatal HIV testing was also recommended for all women as part of their normal gestational screening tests.\n\n【9】 #Natural history, complications, and prognosis\nThere is currently no cure for HIV/AIDS.  HIV infection leads to a progressive decline in CD4+ T-lymphocyte count, which increases the risk of succumbing to opportunistic infections and malignancies. HIV has a variable rate of progression that is determined by specific host and viral factors.The median time from infection to the development of AIDS ranges from 8 to 10 years among untreated individuals. With the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), both morbidity and mortality have dramatically decreased. Survival and the rate of CD4+ T-lymphocyte-count recovery is influenced by age, baseline CD4+ T-lymphocyte count, baseline viral load, and initial and sustained viral suppression. In areas where highly active antiretroviral therapy is widely available, the development of highly active antiretroviral therapy as effective therapy for HIV infection and AIDS reduced the death rate from this disease by 80%, and raised the life expectancy for a newly diagnosed HIV-infected patient to near normal (assuming full compliance with HAART). HIV infection makes individuals highly susceptible to severe opportunistic infections and neoplastic disease. Major complications of HIV/AIDS include Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex infection, cryptococcal meningitis, cytomegalovirus retinitis, Kaposi sarcoma, and primary CNS lymphoma.\n\n【10】 #Opportunistic infections\nMajor opprtunistic infections characteristic of AIDS include such viral infections as CMV retinitis, mucosal HSV, and varicella zoster; bacterial infections such as bacillary angiomatosis, tuberculosis, mycobacterium avium complex, and syphilis; and fungal infections such as cryptococcosis, mucocutaneous candidiasis, coccidiomycosis, and pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. It is important to recognize that the relationship between opportunistic infections (OIs) and HIV infection is bi-directional. HIV causes the immunosuppression that allows opportunistic pathogens to cause disease in HIV-infected persons. OIs, as well as other co-infections that may be common in HIV-infected persons, such as sexually transmitted infections (STIs), can adversely affect the natural history of HIV infection by causing reversible increases in circulating viral load, which could accelerate HIV progression and increase the likelihood of transmission of HIV.The widespread use of ART starting in the mid-1990s has had the most profound influence on reducing OI-related mortality in HIV-infected persons in those countries in which these therapies are accessible and affordable.\n\n【11】 #HIV Co-infections\nTuberculosis, hepatitis B and hepatitis C are three of the most common co-infections found in patients with HIV owing mostly to their mode of transmission and epidemiological distribution. Co-infetions may manifest differently in patients with HIV due to the altered immune response. Accordingly, screening for these infections is recommended in all patients diagnosed with HIV.\n\n【12】 #HIV and pregnancy\nApproximately one in four HIV-positive women are unaware of their disease status, which puts them at high risk of passing the virus to their children. Mother-to-child transmission is the most common way in which children become infected with HIV. Virtually all AIDS cases in U.S. children are the result of mother-to-child transmission. HIV transmission is reduced from 25% to less than 2% in women taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) before and during birth, and if their babies are given therapy after birth. Accordingly, universal “opt-out” HIV testing is recommended for all pregnant women early in every pregnancy.Triple therapy should be administered to all pregnant women diagnosed with HIV. However, regardless of the antenatal ART regimen, zidovudine should be administered to the mother as an intravenous infusion during labor, and to the neonate orally for 6 months after birth.\n\n【13】 #HIV infection in infants\nThe use of ART during pregnancy in HIV-infected women has resulted in a dramatic decrease in the rate of transmission to infants, which is currently less than 2% in the United States. The number of infants with AIDS in the United States continues to decline.  For infants born to mothers with unknown HIV status, rapid HIV antibody testing of the mother and/or infant is recommended as soon as possible after birth, with immediate initiation of infant antiretroviral prophylaxis if the rapid test is positive. Virologic assays that directly detect HIV must be used to diagnose HIV infection in infants younger than 18 months. HIV antibody testing cannot establish HIV infection in this age group because maternal HIV antibodies may persist and interfere with the interpretation of a positive HIV antibody test. The treatment of children living with HIV infection is associated with challenges of adherence, drug resistance, reproductive health planning, management of multiple drugs, and long-term complications from HIV and its treatments.\n\n【14】 ## Case Definition\nAIDS is defined as an the presence of either of the following in a patient with HIV infection: a CD4+ T cell count below 200 cells/µl, a CD4+ T cell percentage of total lymphocytes of less than 15%, or the presence of any of the 27 specified AIDS-defining illnesses.\n\n【15】 ## History and symptoms\nAcute HIV should be suspected in patients with flu-like or mononucleosis-like symptoms within 2-4 weeks of exposure to HIV virus or participation in high-risk behaviors. Important historical questions for patients with diagnosed HIV/AIDS include: most recent CD4 T cell count and viral load, date of testing, previous and current ART regimens and adherence to treatment, prior drug resistance testing, current antibiotic prophylaxis, and history of AIDS-defining illnesses. Although a significant proportion of patients are asymptomatic, those who manifest an acute illness present with fever, lymphadenopathy, rash, fatigue, and myalgia. This stage is usually followed by a clinical latency period throughout which patients may not experience any symptoms. AIDS defines the final stage of HIV infection and indicates significant immunodeficiency. AIDS classically presents with weight loss, night sweats, fatigue, and symptoms of opportunistic infections (or AIDS-defining illnesses) such as diarrhea, mucosal sores, cough, and cognitive and neurological deficits.\n\n【16】 ## Physical examination\nFindings include fever, lymphadenopathy, rash, oral thrush, retinal infiltrates, crackles on auscultation, and focal neurologic deficits.\n\n【17】 ## Laboratory Findings\nImportant laboratory tests for the initial evaluation of patients with suspected HIV infection include screening tests with high sensitivity such as ELISA, dot blot, and latex agglutination assays; and confirmatory tests with high specificity such as Western blot assays, P24 antigen assays, and nucleic acid testing. Two surrogate markers, the CD4 T cell count (CD4 count) and the plasma HIV RNA viral load, are routinely used to asses immune function and levels of viremia. Resistance testing is becoming of greater importance in the management of HIV/AIDS patients given the increased resistance to certain antiretroviral agents.\n\n【18】 ## Electrocardiogram\nCardiac abnormalities observed in patients with HIV include pericardial effusion, myocarditis, dilated cardiomyopathy, and/or endocardial involvement at any stage of the disease. On ECG, patients may exhibit increased heart rate, prolonged QT interval, and non-specific ST-T changes.\n\n【19】 ## Chest X Ray\nChest X-ray findings in HIV/AIDS are related to the development of opportunistic lung infections. They include ground-glass infiltrates suggestive of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, lobar consolidation, pleural effusions, loculated empyemas, and lymphadenopathy.\n\n【20】 ## CT\n\n【21】 ## MRI\nMRI is the neuroimaging modality of choice for the work-up of HIV-positive patients with suspected CNS disease. MRI can aid in the diagnosis of primary CNS lymphoma, AIDS dementia complex, and cerebral toxoplasmosis. The AIDS-dementia complex is characterized by diffuse cerebral atrophy, enlargement of the cerebral ventricles, and diffuse white matter hypoattenuation. Cerebral toxoplasmosis presents with ring enhancing lesions with surrounding edema that may closely resemble primary CNS lymphoma.\n\n【22】 ## Medical Therapy\nThe primary goal of antiretroviral therapy (ART) is to reduce HIV-associated morbidity and mortality. This goal is best accomplished by using highly-active ART to maximally inhibit HIV replication, as defined by achievement and maintenance of plasma HIV RNA (viral load) below detectable levels, restoration of normal CD4 cell count, and prevention of transmission of the disease. Major classes of agents used in the treatment of HIV include: Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), protease inhibitors (PIs), fusion inhibitors, CCR5 antagonists, and integrase inhibitors. All regimens are combinations of at least 3 agents, preferably with 2 NRTIs. Durable viral suppression improves immune function and quality of life, lowers the risk of both AIDS-defining and non-AIDS-defining complications, and prolongs life. Based on emerging evidence, additional benefits of ART include a reduction in HIV-associated inflammation and its associated complications.\n\n【23】 ## Surgery\nHIV-infected patients may require surgery to treat infections and diseases associated with the condition. Childbirth and organ transplant are two of the many conditions that may necessitate surgery in an HIV-positive patient.\n\n【24】 ## Primary Prevention\nThere is currently no vaccine or cure for HIV or AIDS to date. The only known methods of prevention are based on avoiding exposure to the virus or, failing that, an antiretroviral treatment directly after a highly significant exposure, called post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP).\n\n【25】 ## Secondary Prevention\nSecondary prevention encompasses measures to reduce the complications of HIV as well as spread of the disease in the population.\n\n【26】 ## Cost-Effectiveness of Therapy\nHIV and AIDS slow economic growth by destroying human capital. Without proper nutrition, health care, and medicine that is available in developed countries, large numbers of people are falling victim to AIDS. They will not only be unable to work, but will also require significant and expensive medical care. It is expected that this will likely cause a collapse of economies and societies in certain regions. In some heavily infected areas, the epidemic has left behind many orphans who are cared for by elderly grandparents.\n\n【27】 ## Future or Investigational Therapies\nResearch to improve current treatments includes decreasing side effects of current drugs, further simplifying drug regimens to improve adherence, and determining the best sequence of regimens to manage drug resistance", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Once these factors have been taken into account, choice should be made on the basis of cost minimisation\n\n【2】 #Clinical Need and Practice\nAsthma is a common disease that produces symptoms of wheezing and breathlessness. It affects the lower airways and results in narrowing (bronchoconstriction) of the airways with consequent reduction in the flow of gases between the airways and lung alveoli. It can be triggered by a variety of environmental factors such as infection, allergy, airborne chemicals and also exercise. There are a number of patterns of lower airways disease in early childhood that results in two predominant clinical patterns (acute wheezy episodes and recurrent day to day symptoms) that may occur separately or together in the child.\nThe overall prevalence of asthma in England and Wales is around 8% to 10% although not all cases are currently being treated. In all children under the age of 5 years about 9% of boys and 6% of girls are prescribed inhalers. There is a strong genetic component in the aetiology of this disease. There is also wide geographical variation in prevalence, with asthma being more common in, for example, urban rather than rural communities. It has a wide range of severity, is the cause of considerable morbidity and a rare cause of death.\nThe estimated annual drug cost for asthma to the NHS in England and Wales in all age groups is approximately £115 million. In children under the age of 5 years this cost is about £8 million\n\n【3】 #The Technology\nIt is important to ensure that an inhaler device delivers the drugs to the airways consistently and in the appropriate quantity. There are a variety of inhaler devices that can be used in the management of asthma: hand held inhalers i.e. pressurised metered dose inhalers (pMDIs) (which can be breath activated or manual) and dry-powder inhalation systems (DPIs) and nebulisers. All the metered dose inhaler systems require co-ordination of activation and inhalation and may be difficult to use, particularly for younger children. For this reason a pMDI should be combined with a spacer device in young children. The purpose of the spacer device is to act as an intermediary chamber into which the pMDI can discharge the drug allowing the child to inhale over several breaths.\nThe 1997 BTS Guidelines recommend the following device choices for children of under 5 years of age:\nAge Group st Choice Device\nBreath-actuated\nDry-powder\n-2 years inclusive\nMDI + spacer + face mask\nNebuliser (rarely needed)\nAvoid\nNot proven\nPossible use for ß2-agonist but not recommended for corticosteroids\nInterpretation of the evidence base for effectiveness of inhaler devices is influenced by a number of potential factors – the drug being delivered by the device, the severity of asthma, whether the condition is acute or chronic and the ability of the child/carer to effectively use the device. Moreover it is not possible to directly extrapolate to children under the age of five years, data collected in older children and adults, as the young child's anatomy and physiology may substantially alter the amount of drug delivered\n\n【4】 #Evidence\nDelivery of corticosteriods by a hand held device agonists by a hand held device agonists or anticholinergics by nebuliser\nCost Effectiveness\nThere is currently a wide range in the cost of drug/inhaler combinations. No cost effectiveness studies were identified that make direct comparison between asthma devices in children under the age of 5 years with chronic asthma.\n#Implications for the NHS\nWhere the 1997 BTS guidelines are currently being applied in practice, the guidance is unlikely to result in substantial change in NHS costs. The impact of referral patterns is difficult to predict. It is likely however to strengthen and improve the quality of primary care based asthma therapy, thereby reducing the need for admission or outpatient referral\n\n【5】 #Further research\nAt present there is insufficient evidence regarding the most clinically and cost effective spacer (e.g. small or large volume). This is reflected in the current lack of standardisation and variations in the usage of these devices. Further research in this area should be carried out in relation to optimising the reproducibility, consistency and acceptability of these delivery systems as well as their overall clinical and cost effectiveness.\nWell conducted community based trials in the management of asthma in young children and studies to investigate factors determining compliance (including health education and the acceptability of devices) in this group of children would enhance the future evidence base\n\n【6】 #Review of Guidance\nInformation on the review of the guidance on this technology is available on the NICE website\n\n【7】 i The following documentation and opinion was made available to the Committee:\n\n【8】 b Manufacturer/Sponsor submissions:\ni.

Bleb-related endophthalmitis is a complication of trabeculectomy. The exact pathogenesis of bleb-related endopthalmitis following trabeculectomy is not fully understood. It is thought that bleb-related endophthalmitis is the result of bleb leakage, which allows bacterial entry from the tear film and the periocular structures into the anterior chamber or the vitreous humor.\nBased on latency of onset, bleb-related endophthalmitis (BRE) may be classified into early onset and late onset. Common causes of bleb-related endophthalmitis include Streptococcus spp. Staphylococcus spp. and Haemophilus influenzae. Common risk factors for the development of bleb-related endophthalmitis include bleb leakage, inappropriate use of  antifibrotic agents such as 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and mitomycin C, inferior and nasal placement of bleb, and prior history of blebitis. Bleb-related endophthalmitis is a medical emergency. If left untreated, it may lead to corneal infiltration, retinal toxicity, corneal perforation, retinal detachment, and panophthalmitis that may require enucleation.\nBleb-related endophthalmitis presents as an accelerated prodromal syndrome, which can progress rapidly over several hours. It is usually characterized by severe visual loss and marked pain.\nEndophthalmitis is a clinical diagnosis supported by culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of intra-ocular fluids.\nPatients with bleb-related endophthalmitis need urgent examination by an expert ophthalmologist and/or vitreo-retinal specialist. Intravitreal injection of antibiotics, topical fortified antibiotics, and surgical repair are necessary in the management of bleb related endophthalmitis. However, the benefit of vitrectomy in the management of bleb related endophthalmitis remains unclear. Assessment of bleb leakage following trabeculectomy surgery in every visit seems to be the most effective measure for the primary prevention of bleb-related endophthalmitis.\n\n【3】 #Historical Perspective\n- Since the introduction of trabeculectomy in 1968, the first phenomenon of bleb related infections was documented.\n\n【4】 #Classification\nBased on latency of onset, bleb-related endophthalmitis (BRE) can be classified into:\n- Early onset (Less than 6 weeks since surgery)\n\n【5】 #Pathophysiology\nBleb-related endophthalmitis is a complication of trabeculectomy.\nThe exact pathogenesis of bleb-related endopthalmitis following trabeculectomy is not fully understood. It is thought that bleb-related endophthalmitis is the result of bleb leakage, which allows bacteria from the tear film and the periocular structures access into the anterior chamber or the vitreous humor.\nTrabeculectomy is performed to achieve low intraocular pressure (IOP) in glaucoma that has failed medical management. A filtering bleb is a surgically created defect in the sclera which allows excess aqueous humor to leak out of the anterior chamber and be absorbed into the systemic circulation.\nThere is a serious concern for bleb-related endophthalmitis (BRE) even after successful trabeculectomy.\nEarly onset bleb leakage is commonly caused by either wound dehiscence or incomplete conjunctival closure. Late onset bleb leakage is caused by the use of adjunctive anti-metabolites such as mitomycin C (MMC) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), which are usually used to prevent fibrosis and scarring of the scleral flap and bleb.\nAnti-metabolites may result in bleb leakage by the following mechanism:\n- Reduced mucin production (secondary to loss of goblet cell)\n- General conjunctival thinning\n- Reduced cellularity\n- Avascular bleb\nEven in the absence of a leak, it is also thought that more virulant organisms, such as streptococcus spp, can penetrate an intact bleb into the anterior chamber and vitreous humor.\n\n【6】 #Causes\nCommon causes of bleb-related endophthalmitis include:\n- Early onset BRE\nStaphylococcus epidermidis\nStreptococcus spp. (31%)\nHaemophilus influenzae( 23%)\nEnterococcus\nPseudomonas\nMoraxella - Staphylococcus spp. (7%-22%)\n\n【7】 #Differentiating Bleb-related Endophthalmitis from Other Diseases\nBleb-related endophthalmitis must be differentiated from:\n- Blebitis (bleb-related endophthalmitis is characterized by severe loss of vision, marked pain, and presence of vitritis)\n- Anterior uveitis - Uveitis-glaucoma-hyphema syndrome\n\n【8】 ## Incidence\n- The incidence of bleb-related endophthalmitis is approximately range from 170 to 1,300 per 100,000 individuals with trabeculectomy surgery.\n\n【9】 ## Age\nThe incidence of  bleb-related endophthalmitis decreases with age.\nMany studies have shown a higher prevalence of blebitis in younger patients (younger than 40 years old).\n\n【10】 ## Gender\nMales are more commonly affected with bleb-related endophthalmitis than females.\n\n【11】 ## Race\nAfrican-Americans are more commonly affected with bleb-related endophthalmitis than other races.\n\n【12】 ## Developed countries\nIn the United States, the incidence of bleb-related endophthalmitis is approximately range from 450 to 1,300 per 100,000 individuals with trabeculectomy after up to 5 years follow up.\n\n【13】 #Risk Factors\nCommon risk factors in the development of bleb-related endophthalmitis include:\n- Bleb-related risk factors\nBleb leakage (increase the risk of bleb infection 26 fold)\nInappropriate use of  of The antifibrotic agents (such as 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and mitomycin C (MMC))\nInferior and nasal placement of bleb\nPrior history of blebitis\nBleb manipulation/trauma\nBleb revision surgery\n- Ocular risk factors\nConjunctivitis\nBlepharitis\nNasolacrimal duct obstruction\nContact lens wear\nAbnormal lid position\n- Systemic risk factors\nDiabetes\nChronic antibiotic use\nJuvenile glaucoma\nMale\nAge under 60 years\nBlack race\nUpper respiratory infection (URI)\nMalnutrition\n\n【14】 #Screening\nScreening for bleb-related endophthalmitis is not recommended following trabeculactomy surgery.\nHowever, screening for bleb leakage by ophthalmologist following each visit is recommended among patients with trabeculactomy surgery.\n\n【15】 ## Natural History\nBleb-related endophthalmitis is a medical emergency. If left untreated, It may lead to corneal infiltration, retinal toxicity, corneal perforation, retinal detachment, and panophthalmits that may require enucleation.\n\n【16】 ## Complications\nComplications to bleb resalted endophthalmitis include:\n- Corneal perforation\n- Persistence intraocular inflammation\n- Cataract\n- Hypotony\n- Residdual vitreous opacity\n\n【17】 ## Prognosis\nDespite intensive topical, systemic, and intravitreal antibiotics in combination with vitrectomy. Bleb-related endophthalmitis is associated with a poor ​visual outcome. Bleb-related endophthalmitis caused by moraxella and coagulase negative staphylococcus is associated with more favorable outcomes compared with those caused by streptococcus.\n\n【18】 #Diagnosis\nEndophthalmitis is a clinical diagnosis, supported by culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of intra-ocular fluids.\n\n【19】 ## History\nSpecific areas of focus when obtaining a history from the patient with bleb-related endophthalmitis include:\n- Prior history of trabeculectomy\n- History of blebitis - Use of adjunctive anti-metabolites, such as mitomycin C(MMC) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)\n\n【20】 ## Symptoms\nPatients with bleb-related endophthalmitis present with accelerated prodromal syndrome, which can progress rapidly over several hours.\nSymptoms of bleb-related endophthalmitis may include the following:\n- Ocular pain and  discomfort\n- Redness\n- Blurred vision\n- Eye Discharge\n- Loss of vision\n- Headache\n- External ocular inflammation\n\n【21】 ## Physical Examination\nA thorough physical and eye examination from the patient is necessary. Common ophthalmoscopic examination findings of bleb-related endophthalmitis include:\n- Ocular pain\n- Redness\n- Decreased vision\n- Conjunctival injection\n- Chemosis - Hyperemic conjunctiva, opacified bleb with purulent adherent material, hypopyon, and fibrinous AC reaction.\n- “White-on-red” appearance of acute blebitis - Thin walled, transparent, tense, avascular bleb\n\n【22】 ## Laboratory Findings\nLaboratory studies consistent with the diagnosis of bleb-related endophthalmitis include:\n- Culture and gram stain of aqueous humor as well as the vitreous humor - Conjunctival and eyelid cultures\n\n【23】 ### X Ray\nThere are no diagnostic x ray findings associated with bleb-related endophthalmitis.\n\n【24】 ### CT\n\n【25】 ### MRI\nThere are no diagnostic MRI findings associated with bleb-related endophthalmitis.\n\n【26】 ### Ultrasound\nB scan ultrasonography may be helpful in diagnosis of coexisting posterior segment problem, such as vitreous changes or retinal detachment, in patient with bleb-related endophthalmitis.\n\n【27】 ### Other Imaging Findings\nThere are no other Imaging Findings associated with bleb-related endophthalmitis.\n\n【28】 ### Slit lamp examination\n- A mucopurulent infiltrate\n- Anterior chamber and vitreous inflammation\n- Hypopyon\n- Inflamed bleb\n- Bleb leak\n\n【29】 #Treatment\nThe patient needs urgent examination by an expert ophthalmologist and/or vitreo-retina specialist who will usually decide for urgent intervention to provide intravitreal injection of potent antibiotics.

there is limited evidence on the safety of cannabis-based medicinal products during pregnancy and breastfeeding).\npotential impact on psychological, emotional and cognitive development\n\n【10】 ## Supporting shared decision making\nBefore prescribing cannabis-based medicinal products, discuss with people:\nthe potential benefits and harms, including any risk of dependence or interaction with other medicines the licensing status of the medicines how long they might take the medicine how long it will take to work what it has been prescribed for and how to take it how it may affect their ability to drive\nthe need to seek advice before travelling abroad about the legality of cannabis-based medicinal products in other countries .\nWhen discussing cannabis-based medicinal products with patients and their families and carers, follow the NICE guideline on shared decision making.\n\n【11】 ## Cannabis-based medicinal products\nIn this guideline cannabis-based medicinal products include:\ncannabis-based products for medicinal use as set out by the UK Government in the 2018 Regulations the licensed products delta-9-tetrahydrocannibinol combined with cannabidiol (Sativex) and nabilone plant-derived cannabinoids such as pure cannabidiol (CBD)\nsynthetic compounds which are identical in structure to naturally occurring cannabinoids such as delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), for example, dronabinol.\n\n【12】 ## Optimised conventional antiemetics\nThese are treatments that are commonly used in practice at an optimum tolerated dose to manage nausea and vomiting\n\n【13】 #Recommendations for research\nThe guideline committee has made the following recommendations for research.\n\n【14】 ## Fibromyalgia or persistent treatment-resistant neuropathic pain in adults\nFor adults with fibromyalgia or persistent treatment-resistant neuropathic pain, what is the clinical and cost effectiveness of cannabidiol (CBD), containing no, or traces of, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), as an add-on to standard treatment?\n\n【15】 ## Chronic pain in children and young people\nFor children and young people with intractable cancer-related pain and pain associated with specific diseases (such as epidermolysis bullosa), what is the clinical and cost effectiveness of cannabis-based medicinal products as an add-on to standard treatment to improve symptoms compared with treatment with standard care?\n\n【16】 ## CBD for severe treatment-resistant epilepsy\nWhat is the clinical and cost effectiveness of CBD in epileptic disorders in children, young people and adults?\n\n【17】 ## THC in combination with CBD for severe treatment-resistant epilepsy\nDoes the addition of THC to CBD have an effect on seizure frequency, brain structure and neuropsychological performance when compared with both CBD alone and placebo in epileptic disorders in children, young people and adults?\n\n【18】 ## Spasticity\nWhat is the clinical and cost effectiveness of cannabis-based medicinal products other than THC: CBD spray for children, young people and adults with spasticity? In particular, what is the impact of spasticity on improvements in quality of life?\n\n【19】 ## Chemotherapy-induced intractable nausea and vomiting in adults\nWhat is the clinical and cost effectiveness of cannabis-based medicinal products as an add-on treatment for adults with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting which persists with optimised conventional antiemetics?\n\n【20】 ## Chemotherapy-induced intractable nausea and vomiting in babies, children and young people\nWhat is the clinical and cost effectiveness of cannabis-based medicinal products as an add-on treatment in babies, children and young people with chemotherapy-induced nausea or vomiting which persists with optimised conventional antiemetics?\n\n【21】 ## Intractable nausea and vomiting not caused by chemotherapy in adults\nWhat is the clinical and cost effectiveness of cannabis-based medicinal products as an add-on treatment for adults with persistent nausea or vomiting not caused by chemotherapy which hasn't fully responded to optimised conventional antiemetics?\n\n【22】 ## Intractable nausea and vomiting not caused by chemotherapy in babies, children and young people\nWhat is the clinical and cost effectiveness of cannabis-based medicinal products as an add-on treatment for babies, children and young people with persistent nausea or vomiting not caused by chemotherapy which hasn't fully responded to optimised conventional antiemetics\n\n【23】 #Rationale and impact\nThese sections briefly explain why the committee made the recommendations and how they might affect practice\n\n【24】 #Intractable nausea and vomiting\nand 1.1.2\n\n【25】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nIntractable nausea or vomiting can be defined as persistent nausea or vomiting that does not respond fully to optimised conventional antiemetics. Although there are different causes of intractable or persistent nausea and vomiting, evidence was only identified for the use of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), nabilone and dronabinol in people with chemotherapy-induced and radiotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.\nLimited evidence showed that nabilone, which is licensed in the UK for adults, resulted in complete or partial reduction in chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. However, most of the studies were old, of low quality and used outdated antiemetic regimens that do not reflect current practice. Nabilone was also associated with more adverse events (drowsiness, dizziness and dry mouth), particularly in children\nThe committee agreed that nabilone may play a role in treating intractable chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in people who have not had a full response to optimised conventional antiemetics. Based on the limited evidence, the committee only recommended that nabilone could be considered as an add-on treatment in adults with intractable chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting which persists despite the use of optimised conventional antiemetics.\nEvidence for the use of other cannabis-based medicinal products was limited and the committee were unable to make any practice recommendations. However, they made a recommendation for research to inform future guidance.\nNabilone is not currently licensed in the UK for children and young people under 18 years because its safety and efficacy has not been established. Therefore, the committee made another recommendation for research on the effectiveness of cannabis-based medicinal products in babies, children and young people with intractable nausea and vomiting.\nOnly 1 study was identified which included people with radiotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. The committee noted that there are other causes of intractable nausea and vomiting but were unable to make further recommendations due to lack of evidence. Therefore, the committee made an additional recommendation for research.\n\n【26】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\nThe committee highlighted that the use of nabilone is uncommon in current practice and it is not used as first-line treatment for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. The recommendations could result in an increase in use of nabilone as an add-on treatment for adults with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, but the current level of use is uncertain.\n\n【27】 #Chronic pain\n\n【28】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nSome evidence showed that CBD reduced chronic pain, but the treatment effect was modest (an average improvement of about 0.4 on a scale ranging from 0 to 10). The evidence did not show a reduction in opioid use in people prescribed medicinal cannabis. Because the number of people who might benefit is large and the cost potentially high, an economic model was developed to compare benefits with the potential costs. The model used data from the trials in the base-case analysis but also assumed a larger potential benefit from cannabis-based medicinal products in various sensitivity analyses. In all cases, the potential benefits offered were small compared with the high and ongoing costs, and the products were not an effective use of NHS resources. The evidence included CBD in combination with THC, THC alone, dronabinol and nabilone so the committee named these products in the recommendation. The committee also agreed that the recommendation should follow the evidence and specify adults.\nThere was no evidence for the use of CBD alone (either as a pure product or containing traces of THC). Therefore, the committee recommended that CBD should not be offered unless as part of a clinical trial. People who have fibromyalgia or persistent treatment-resistant neuropathic pain are often taking high doses of medicines for pain relief over long periods. These can cause nausea, drowsiness, mood disturbance and fatigue. The committee noted that this is a significant population of people with chronic pain (around 15%). They therefore made a recommendation for research for CBD in adults with fibromyalgia or treatment-resistant neuropathic pain.\n\n【29】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\nPrescriptions of cannabis-based medicinal products for chronic pain are currently rare. GPs refer people with chronic pain to specialist pain services where clinicians on the Specialist Register with expertise in this area decide whether cannabis-based medicinal products should be prescribed. The new recommendation might reduce the number of these prescriptions.\n\n【30】 #Spasticity\n3.2\n\n【31】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThe committee agreed that the evidence showed benefits of THC:CBD spray (licensed product in UK: Sativex) for treating spasticity in people with multiple sclerosis. There were reductions in some measures of patient-reported spasticity and no difference in adverse events in the treatment or placebo groups, although much of the evidence was assessed as low quality. The committee agreed that the longer-term benefits of THC:CBD spray are likely to outweigh any potential harms, although it was not clear how benefits related to improvements in quality of life.\nThe committee considered the evidence from 2 published economic evaluations but noted that they had contradictory conclusions about the cost effectiveness of THC:CBD spray and were subject to potentially serious limitations. So they considered results from a new economic model developed specifically for the cannabis guideline. The model included data from all relevant trials, longer-term registry data and data on adverse events. In reflection of the trial evidence, the model predicted that the average person would receive a quality of life (QALY) gain equivalent to around 30 days perfect health with THC:CBD spray added to standard care. The acquisition costs of the treatment are offset by predicted savings in management costs. The model estimates that THC:CBD spray would offer sufficient QALY gains if reduction in spasticity led to a halving of management costs and the acquisition cost of THC:CBD spray was also reduced (in addition to the existing pay-for-responders scheme). The committee agreed that under these conditions THC:CBD spray could be recommended to treat moderate to severe spasticity in adults with multiple sclerosis if other pharmacological treatments had not been effective.\nThe committee acknowledged that women are more likely to receive a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis than men. However, they considered this would not cause an inequality in relation to treatment.\nBecause there is limited evidence from trials on how reductions in spasticity affect quality of life and no evidence was found for conditions such as cerebral palsy, the committee agreed to make a recommendation for research to inform future guidance.\n\n【32】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\nThese recommendations are a change to NICE's previous guidance on treating spasticity in adults with multiple sclerosis, which did not support the use of THC:CBD spray. They are therefore expected to lead to THC:CBD spray being used as an add-on treatment for adults with treatment-resistant spasticity due to multiple sclerosis, with concomitant reductions in the need for supportive care.\n\n【33】 #Severe treatment-resistant epilepsy\nRecommendation for research on CBD, and THC in combination with CBD\n\n【34】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations for research\nThe only cannabis-based medicinal product available for the treatment of epilepsy is epidyolex, which is licensed specifically for Dravet and Lennox-Gastaut syndromes. All other cannabis-based medicinal products are unlicensed for epilepsy. The committee were aware from cases highlighted by stakeholders that individual patients have reported having fewer seizures with these medicines when other treatments have not fully controlled the seizures. But current research is limited and of low quality, making it difficult to assess just how effective these medicines are for people with epilepsy. Published randomised controlled trials have focused on the use of pure CBD in people with Dravet and Lennox-Gastaut syndromes. People with these epilepsy syndromes also report a very high rate of adverse events. Open-label studies (clinical trials in which the treatment and placebo groups are not disguised) of cannabis-based medicinal products in other types of epilepsy have also shown a very high level of adverse events (in up to 98% of people), but it was not possible to determine how many of these were due to the cannabis-based products.\nThe committee agreed that more evidence is needed on the effectiveness of cannabis-based medicinal products in severe treatment-resistant epilepsy and made a recommendation for research to inform future practice. They discussed that some individual funding requests are denied because of lack of evidence of effectiveness. More research across different types of epilepsy may address this evidence gap.\n\n【35】 #Prescribing: who should prescribe and shared care\n\n【36】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nBased on current legislation, the complexity of the conditions, and the licensed (nabilone and Sativex) and unlicensed status of these medicines, the committee agreed that the initial prescription of unlicensed cannabis-based medicinal products must be made by a specialist medical practitioner (a doctor included in the register of specialist medical practitioners ). They should also have a special interest in the condition being treated. The committee also agreed that THC:CBD spray should be initiated by a physician with special expertise in treating spasticity due to multiple sclerosis. Although there are no legal requirements for nabilone to be prescribed by a specialist prescriber.\nThere was limited evidence on who should prescribe and monitor cannabis-based medicinal products. Studies were conducted in Australia and Canada, and 1 study included participants from 8 different European countries. These countries have different healthcare systems, funding streams and legislation, which raised questions about their applicability to the prescribing of cannabis-based medicinal products in England. It was also not clear whether all products could be considered cannabis-based products for medicinal use as defined in the 2018 Regulations.\nGuidance from the British Paediatric Neurology Association, based on current UK legislation and policy, advises that for children with intractable epilepsy, cannabis-based products should only be prescribed by a consultant paediatric neurologist. The committee agreed that for children and young people the initiating specialist prescriber for cannabis-based medicinal products should be a tertiary paediatric specialist with a special interest in the condition being treated (for example, for a child or young person with epilepsy, this would be a tertiary paediatric epilepsy specialist).\nThe committee noted that NICE's guideline on controlled drugs recommends that no more than a 30-day supply of a controlled drug is prescribed at any one time. Once their condition is stable, people taking cannabis-based medicinal products are likely to need repeat prescriptions. They will also need close monitoring of effectiveness and adverse effects, and dose adjustments. The committee agreed that there are potential burdens for patients associated with limiting prescribing and monitoring to tertiary care. They were aware of electronic prescription systems that could help patients to access prescriptions locally, but knew that these services vary by location. The committee discussed whether shared care would be appropriate and in the patient's best interest. They agreed that a shared care agreement could be considered, which could involve other healthcare professionals such as GPs and non-medical prescribers if they were confident to take on the responsibility of prescribing\nThe committee agreed that after the initial assessment and prescription by a specialist, allowing other prescribers to prescribe cannabis-based products under specialist direction would improve access for patients.\n\n【37】 Because some patients may need long-term treatment, the agreement should ensure continuity of care by setting out what should happen when the patient, other prescriber or specialist moves location. This should include handover of responsibilities to other specialists or prescribers.\n\n【38】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\nCurrently, prescribing and monitoring cannabis-based medicinal products takes place in tertiary care. The recommendations focus on shared care after the initial prescription with the involvement of other healthcare professionals such as non-medical prescribers and GPs. This will allow a more holistic approach to care. Moving away from tertiary care may be cost saving for the NHS.\n\n【39】 #Prescribing: factors to think about when prescribing\n\n【40】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThe committee agreed a number of factors that should be considered before prescribing cannabis-based medicinal products, based on study data, summaries of product characteristics and committee experience. They highlighted these in a recommendation along with some of the contraindications from the studies of the effectiveness and safety of cannabis-based medicinal products for nausea and vomiting, chronic pain, epilepsy and spasticity.\nMany people use non-prescribed, over-the-counter or over-the-internet, cannabis-based food supplements. The committee agreed that when someone is prescribed cannabis-based medicinal products they should be advised to stop using any non-prescribed cannabis products. This will reduce the risk of any drug interactions and reduce the potential for people taking a higher dose of cannabis than prescribed.\n\n【41】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\nThese recommendations will help to guide prescribers on some of the important issues to consider when prescribing cannabis-based medicinal products. This may result in more prescriptions for cannabis-based medicinal products, which may increase costs to the NHS. However, if symptoms are reduced with the use of cannabis-based medicinal products this may ultimately reduce the cost of other treatment for these patients, either through primary care or urgent care services.\n\n【42】 #Prescribing: supporting shared decision making\n5.11\n\n【43】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nLimited evidence was identified on the support prescribers and people may need when making decisions on cannabis-based medicinal products. Some evidence identified the need for training and further education for prescribers, while international guidelines described the overarching support that people seeking cannabis-based medicinal products may need.\nThe committee agreed that the key theme was the need for prescribers to discuss the risks, benefits and alternatives to cannabis-based medicinal products with people seeking treatment. The committee noted that with the change in legislation people may require licensed or unlicensed medicines, which would also be a key area for discussion. This recommendation should encourage shared decision making and allow people to make informed decisions about their care.\nThe committee also recommended that prescribers follow the NICE guideline on patient experience in adult NHS services\n\n【44】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\nThe recommendations promote shared decision making and allow people to make informed decisions about their care. The committee noted that there may be situations in which a multidisciplinary team may help to reach a decision on treatment, such as the care of babies, children or young people. A multidisciplinary team may also need to be involved when decisions need to be made that are in the patient's best interest. This may not be feasible in all specialist care settings because staffing and structure of care provision varies.\n\n【45】 Cannabis-based medicinal products have been suggested for a variety of medical conditions. In line with prescribing for all medicines, the potential for harm must be weighed up against the potential for benefit for individual patients.\nAt the time of developing this guideline, delta-9-tetrahydrocannibinol combined with cannabidiol (Sativex), nabilone and cannabidiol (Epidyolex) were the only cannabis-based medicines licensed for use in the UK. Delta-9-tetrahydrocannibinol combined with cannabidiol (Sativex) has been licensed by the MHRA as a treatment for spasticity in adults with multiple sclerosis and is listed under Schedule 4 of the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001 ('2001 Regulations'). Nabilone has been licensed by the MHRA as a control of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in adults and is listed under Schedule 2 of the 2001 Regulations. Cannabidiol (Epidyolex) has been licensed by the MHRA as an add-on treatment for seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or Dravet syndrome, in conjunction with clobazam, for people aged 2 years and over and is listed under Schedule 2 of the 2001 Regulations. Dronabinol is listed under Schedule 2 controlled drugs but does not have a marketing authorisation from the MHRA in the UK.\nUntil September 2018, in cases of exceptional and unmet clinical need, legislation allowed the prescribing of cannabis-based medicinal products through the granting of an individual licence. As Schedule 1 controlled drugs, prescribing was controlled through the licensing process operated by the Home Office.\nIn November 2018, the UK Government set out the following requirements for the prescription of a cannabis-based product:\n'A preparation or other product, other than one to which paragraph 5 of part 1 of schedule 4 applies, which:\nis or contains cannabis, cannabis resin, cannabinol or a cannabinol derivative (not being dronabinol or its stereoisomers)\nis produced for medicinal use in humans; and is a medicinal product, or a substance or preparation for use as an ingredient of, or in the production of an ingredient of, a medicinal product.'\nIn this guideline, cannabis-based medicinal products include:\ncannabis-based products for medicinal use as set out by the UK Government in the 2018 Regulations the licensed products delta-9-tetrahydrocannibinol combined with cannabidiol (Sativex) and nabilone plant-derived cannabinoids such as pure cannabidiol (CBD)\nsynthetic compounds which are identical in structure to naturally occurring cannabinoids such as delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), for example, dronabinol.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Rimland was long an internationally recognized authority on autism spectrum disorders, and was the father of a high-functioning autistic son.\n\n【2】 #Education and early career\nAfter completing his undergraduate studies at San Diego State University, Rimland obtained his PhD in experimental psychology and research design, from Pennsylvania State University in 1953.\nDr. Rimland's son, Mark, was born in 1956, when the diagnosis of autism was rare. From birth, however, something was drastically wrong with Mark. Rimland had recently earned his doctorate, but was not yet familiar with the word autism. Only much later was it determined Mark's condition fell into the category of early infantile autism, rather than regressive autism. Despite challenges, Mark has nevertheless become a talented artist.\nAfter his son's diagnosis, Rimland set forth on a quest to understand autism and bring much needed attention to the disorder, in order to foster research into its causes and treatment. Rimland has often sparked controversy along his way.\nAmong Rimland's major contributions to autism research was his discovery that autism is neurological. This refutation of the prevailing theory, propounded by University of Chicago professor Bruno Bettelheim, that autism was caused by unloving 'refrigerator mothers', helped to substantially change the way autism is viewed by the medical profession today.\n\n【3】 #Conflicts with medical opinion\nMany senior figures in medicine and psychology questioned Rimland's contributions to autism during the latter period of his career. In 1995, Bennett Leventhal, a professor at the University of Chicago, tersely dismissed as \"rubbish\" Rimland's concern about the rise in autism diagnoses, and his assertion that vaccinations might be among the causes.\nRimland was among a minority of researchers who believe that thiomersal (a mercury-based preservative) used in vaccines is a direct cause of autism. The United States Institute of Medicine (IOM) in its 2004 report found that, \"the body of epidemiological evidence favors rejection of a causal relationship between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism.\" The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), National Health Service (NHS), World Health Organization (WHO), European Medicines Agency (EMEA), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Centers for Disease Control (CDC), and many other national and international medical organizations have issued statements of a similar nature, denying a link between autism and thimerosal based on the evidence currently available to science from a variety of studies. Vaccine critics generally dismiss such studies, contending they are often tainted by significant conflict of interest problems, such as the fact that a now-retired FDA commissioner had financial stakes in pharmaceutical companies that produce vaccines and thimerosal.\nIn her book, Children with Starving Brains, Jaquelyn McCandless, MD, calls Rimland \"The grand godfather of the movement for understanding the biological treatment of autism.\" Rimland's book, Infantile Autism: The Syndrome and Its Implication for a Neural Theory of Behavior , is credited by many with changing the prevailing view of autism, in the field of psychiatry, from an emotional illness --widely thought to be caused by refrigerator mothers-- to the current recognition that autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder.\n\n【4】 ## Claims of an \"autism epidemic\"\nRimland was among the first autism campaigners to draw attention to increases in the number of diagnoses of autism. Rimland's early observations about the rise in diagnoses during the mid-1990s, are seen by some as prophetic of the 'autism epidemic' theory. Mainstream opinion, however, holds that increases in the number of diagnoses of autism are substantially, and possibly entirely, a natural result of changing diagnostic criteria, particularly in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, which was reissued by the American Psychiatric Association in markedly revised form in 1994, earlier diagnosis, and improving awareness, among other factors.\n\n【5】 #A brush with Hollywood\nRimland has lectured on autism and related problems throughout the world, including before thousands of professional groups, and he is the author of numerous publications. His high profile, within what was then a small community of autism activists, caught the eye of movie producers in nearby Hollywood, California.\n\n【6】 #Ongoing endeavors\nIn 1967, Rimland founded the Autism Research Institute as a global network of parents and professionals concerned with autism. ARI conducts and fosters scientific research intended to enhance treatments for, and prevention of, autism\nRimland was the editor of the Autism Research Review International, published by ARI, which covers biomedical and educational advances in autism research.\n\n【7】 #Quote\n- \"Soon after my textbook on autism was published in 1964, I began to hear from other parents. Many parents told me that their children were normal until getting a triple vaccine – the DPT shot. In 1965 I began systematically collecting data on the symptoms and possible causes of autism: In 1967 — 33 years ago — I began querying the parents, specifically about the child’s response to the DPT shot. Many had reported marked deterioration. During the past few years the Autism Research Institute has been flooded with an upsurge in pleas for help from parents throughout the world – from wherever the World Health Organization vaccine guidelines are followed.

The pump is available in a wide range of sizes (2.5 cc to 50 cc) that will fit patients of any age and size. The balloon is guided into the descending aorta, approximately 2 cm from the left subclavian artery. At the start of diastole, the balloon inflates, augmenting coronary perfusion. At the beginning of systole, the balloon deflates; blood is ejected from the left ventricle, increasing the cardiac output by as much as 40 percent and decreasing the left ventricular stroke work and myocardial oxygen requirements. In this manner, the balloon supports the heart indirectly.\nThe IABP has two main benefits:\n- The inflation of the balloon displaces an amount of blood to the ascending aorta which increases the pressure there and consequently increases the flow in the coronary arteries.\n\n【2】 ## History\nIn 1958 Harken described for the first time a method to treat left ventricular failure by using counterpulsation or diastolic augmentation. He suggested removing a certain blood volume from the femoral artery during systole and replacing this volume rapidly during diastole. By increasing coronary perfusion pressure this concept would therefore augment cardiac output and unload the functioning heart simultaneously. This method of treatment was limited because of problems with access (need for arteriotomies of both femoral arteries), turbulence and development of massive hemolysis by the pumping apparatus. Even experimental data showed that no augmentation of coronary blood flow was obtained.\nIn 1961 Clauss et al. introduced their study on arterial counterpulsation concept.\nIn 1962 Moulopoulus et al. adapted counterpulsation to intra-aortic balloon pumping and developed an experimental prototype of the intra-aortic balloon (IAB) whose inflation and deflation were timed to the cardiac cycle.\nIn its first years, the IABP required surgical insertion and surgical removal with a balloons size of 15 French.\nIn 1979, the IAB was adapted for percutaneous insertion by Bregman and Casarella, and this was followed in the early 1980s by a dual lumen, wire guided, smaller catheter device which could be placed in couple of minutes with significantly improved insertion success and reduced vascular complications.\n\n【3】 ## Factors Affecting Diastolic Augmentation\n- Patient hemodynamics\nHeart rate\nStroke volume\nMean arterial pressure\nSystemic vascular resistance\n- IABP related mechanical factors\nIntra aortic balloon position\nKink in intra aortic balloon catheter\nLow helium concentration\n- Intra aortic balloon in sheath\nTiming\nPosition of intra aortic balloon augmentation dial\n\n【4】 ### Indications\n- Refractory unstable angina - Impending infarction\n- Acute Myocardial Infarction\n- Complications of acute MI (Acute Mitral Regurgitation, Ventricular Septal Defect, Papillary muscle rupture)\n- Cardiogenic shock\n- Support for diagnostic coronary angiographies and percutaneous coronary ınterventions\n- Ischemia related intractable ventricular arrhythmias\n- Septic shock\n- Intraoperative pulsatile flow generation\n- Weaning from bypass surgery\n- Cardiac support for non-cardiac surgery\n- Prophylactic support in preparation for cardiac surgery\n- Post surgical myocardial dysfunction /low cardiac output syndrome\n- Myocardial contusion\n- Mechanical bridge to other assist devices\n\n【5】 ### Contraindications\n- Anatomic abnormality of femoral or iliac arteries\n- Iliac or aortic atherosclerotic disease impairing blood flow run off\n- Aorto femoral grafts\n- Moderate or severe aortic regurgitation\n- Artificial aortic valves\n- Aortic dissection or aneurysm\n- Patent ductus (counterpulsation may augment the abnormal pathway of aortic to pulmonary artery shunting)\n- Bleeding diathesis - Sepsis - Sheathless insertion with severe obesity, scarring of the groin\n\n【6】 ## Balloon Pump Inserting and Removal Techniques\nIn the early years of IABP- therapy, insertion of the balloon was performed by surgical cut down to the femoral vessels. After a longitudinal incision in the groin, the femoral arteries were identified and controlled. A vascular graft was then sewn to the common femoral artery in an end-to-side fashion. The balloon was introduced into the artery via the graft and properly positioned in the thoracic aorta and the graft tightly secured to the distal portion of the balloon catheter. Finally the skin incision was closed. Removal of the balloon required a second operation.\nSince 1979, a percutaneous placement of the IAB via the femoral artery using a modified Seldinger technique allows an easy and rapid insertion in the majority of situations. After puncture of the femoral artery a J-shaped guidewire is inserted to the level of the aortic arch and then the needle is removed. The arterial puncture side is enlarged with the successive placement of an 8 to 10, 5 Fr dilator/sheath combination. Only the dilator needs to be removed. Continuing, the balloon is threaded over the guidewire into the descending aorta just below (app. 1.5 - 2 cm) the left subclavian artery. The sheath is gently pulled back to connect with the leak-proof cuff on the balloon hub, ideally so that the entire sheath is out of the arterial lumen to minimize risk of ischemic complications to the distal extremity. Recently sheathless insertion kits are available. Removal of a percutaneously placed IAB may either be via surgical removal or closed technique. There are alternative routes for balloon insertion include subclavian, axillary or iliac arteries.\nInsertion of a counterpulsation balloon without a leading guidewire under any circumstances is not recommended.\nWhen clinically indicated the balloon can be removed ,before removal of IAB the patient is weaned progressively from support (decreasing the counterpulsation rate from 1:1 to 1:2 and then 1:3 but should not be reduced below 1:8 to reduce the change of clot formation until immediately before balloon removal) by aspirating negative pressure on the balloon lumen and withdrawing balloon and sheath together (once the balloon has been inflated, its deflated profile is larger than the sheath lumen, and therefore it cannot completely withdrawn into sheath before removal) while compressing the puncture site. The femoral artery compressed below the puncture site as the catheter and sheath are removed to avoid embolism to the leg. Anticoagulation should be discontinued 4 hours before and a partial thromboplastin time (PTT) or activated clotting time (ACT) should be checked before the balloon is removal. Pressure over the groin must be maintened for 30 to 60 minutes.\n\n【7】 ## Assessment of Patients and Maintenance of IABP\n- Evaluation (daily): All patients with IABP should carefully evaluated for\nInfection\nThrombocytopenia: After balloon removal, the platelet count rapidly returns to normal\nHemorrhage\nHemolysis\nVascular obstruction with limb ischemia; regular examination of radial and dorsalis pedis arteries may be helpful for quick evaluation of peripheral arteries.\n- Maintenance\nHeparin administration (5000 U bolus and 1000 U/hr) is almost a standard practice.\nWhen performing angiography or PCI from the contralateral femoral artery a J wire is used. The balloon is placed on standby while the wire and catheter pass the balloon so that damage is minimized.\n- Control of IABP\nTo achieve optimal effect of intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation, inflation and deflation need to be correctly timed to the patient’s cardiac cycle. This is accomplished by either using the patient’s ECG signal, the patient’s arterial waveform or an intrinsic pump rate. The most common method of triggering the IAB is from the R wave of the patient’s ECG signal. Mainly balloon inflation is set automatically to start in the middle of the T wave and to deflate prior to the ending QRS complex.\nTachyarrhythmias, cardiac pacemaker function and poor ECG signals may cause difficulties in obtaining synchronization when the ECG mode is used. In such cases the arterial waveform for triggering may be used.\n- Duration of Intra Aortic Balloon Support\nThe balloon is usually removed once the patient has stabilized after the acute insult.\n\n【8】 ## Complications\nThe success rate for percutaneous insertion of IAB is more than 90%. If signs of ischemia appear the balloon should be removed. In general, vascular injuries should be dealt with directly by surgical interventions and repair. Balloon related problems and infection require removal and/ or replacement of the intra aortic balloon. Complications include:\n- Vascular\nFemoral artery perforation & dissection\nAortic perforation & dissection\nPeripheral embolization\nFemoral vein cannulation\nAV fistula\nFalse aneurysm\nLimb ischemia\nVisceral ischemia - Femoral artery thrombosis - Balloon related\nPerforation\nTear\nRupture\nIncorrect positioning\nGas embolization\n- Others\nHemorrhage (haematomas)\nInfection\nBroken and missing balloon & catheter parts\n\n【9】 ## Role of IABP in High Risk Coronary Interventions\nAlthough, prophylactic use of Intra Aortic Balloon Pump may provide circulatory support during percutaneous coronary interventions in patients at high risk for procedure related morbidity and mortality, usefulness of elective IABP support in patients at high risk for complications during PCI is still controversial.\nPatients with pharmacologically uncontrollable chest pain, high-risk anatomic features, unprotected left main coronary artery stenosis, last remaining vessel supply, same session multivessel complex coronary interventions, coronary disease with ventricular dysfunction and severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction are likely get benefit from previous hemodynamic stabilization because even transient ischemia may produce a fatal complication.\nIABP therapy provides an increase in coronary artery perfusion pressure, reducing the hemodynamic consequences of reduced coronary flow during balloon inflation and other PCI modalities. Placement and institution of IABP therapy before intervening, as opposed to provisional IABP therapy only if complications occur, may prevent intraprocedural cardiac and cerebral complications.\n- Diagram of correct intra aortic balloon timing; A= One complete cardiac cycle, B= Unassisted aortic end diastolic pressure, C= Unassisted systolic blood pressure, D= Diastolic augmentation, E= Reduced aortic end diastolic pressure, F= Reduced systolic blood pressure.\n- Inflation of the intra aortic balloon markedly after closure of the aortic valve (inflation of the balloon after dicrotic notch and absence of a sharp V shape).\n- Premature deflation of the intra aortic balloon during the diastolic phase characterized as; deflation of balloon is seen as a sharp drop following diastolic augmentation, sub-optimal diastolic augmentation, assisted aortic end diastolic pressure may be equal to or less than the unassisted aortic end diastolic pressure and assisted systolic blood pressure may rise.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "115ea8a5-5506-4035-b503-5894e9f454a7", "title": null, "text": "【0】 Lomefloxacin hydrochloride\n\n【1】 #Overview\nLomefloxacin hydrochloride is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic that is FDA approved for the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections and urinary tract infections (UTI) in adult patients. Common adverse reactions include phototoxicity, diarrhea, nausea, dizziness, headache.\n\n【2】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Adult)\n- Maxaquin may be taken without regard to meals. Sucralfate and antacids containing magnesium or aluminum, or Videx (didanosine), chewable/buffered tablets or the pediatric powder for oral solution should not be taken within 4 hours before or 2 hours after taking lomefloxacin. Risk of reaction to solar UVA light may be reduced by taking Maxaquin at least 12 hours before exposure to the sun (eg, in the evening).\n\n【3】 ### Patients with normal renal function\nThe recommended daily dose of Maxaquin is described in the following chart:\n\n【4】 ### Elderly patients\n- No dosage adjustment is needed for elderly patients with normal renal function (ClCr≥ 40 mL/min/1.73 m2).\n\n【5】 ### Patients with impaired renal function\n- Lomefloxacin is primarily eliminated by renal excretion.  Modification of dosage is recommended in patients with renal dysfunction. In patients with a creatinine clearance > 10 mL/min/1.73 m2 but < 40 mL/min/1.73 m2, the recommended dosage is an initial loading dose of 400 mg followed by daily maintenance doses of 200 mg (1/2 tablet) once daily for the duration of treatment. It is suggested that serial determinations of lomefloxacin levels be performed to determine any necessary alteration in the appropriate next dosing interval.\nIf only the serum creatinine is known, the following formula may be used to estimate creatinine clearance.\n- Men:\n(weight in kg) × (140 – age)\n× serum creatinine (mg/dL)\n(0.85) × (calculated value for men)\n\n【6】 ### Dialysis patients\n- Hemodialysis removes only a negligible amount of lomefloxacin (3% in 4 hours). Hemodialysis patients should receive an initial loading dose of 400 mg followed by daily maintenance doses of 200 mg (1/2 tablet) once daily for the duration of treatment.\n\n【7】 ### Prevention/prophylaxis\nThe recommended dose of Maxaquin is described in the following chart:\n\n【8】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Lomefloxacin hydrochloride in adult patients.\n\n【9】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Lomefloxacin hydrochloride in adult patients.\n\n【10】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Pediatric)\nThere is limited information regarding Lomefloxacin hydrochloride FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Pediatric) in the drug label.\n\n【11】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Lomefloxacin hydrochloride in pediatric patients.\n\n【12】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Lomefloxacin hydrochloride in pediatric patients.\n\n【13】 #Contraindications\n- Maxaquin (lomefloxacin HCl) is contraindicated in persons with a history of hypersensitivity to lomefloxacin or any member of the quinolone group of antimicrobial agents.\n\n【14】 The safety and efficacy of lomefloxacin in pediatric patients and adolescents (under the age of 18 years), pregnant women, and lactating women have not been established. The oral administration of multiple doses of lomefloxacin to juvenile dogs at 0.3 times and to rats at 5.4 times the recommended adult human dose based on mg/m2 (0.6 and 34 times the recommended adult human dose based on mg/kg, respectively) caused arthropathy and lameness.\n\n【15】 ### Photosensitivity\n- Moderate to severe phototoxic reactions have occurred in patients exposed to direct or indirect sunlight or to artificial ultraviolet light (eg, sunlamps) during or following treatment with lomefloxacin. These reactions have also occurred in patients exposed to shaded or diffuse light, including exposure through glass. patients should be advised to discontinue lomefloxacin therapy at the first signs or symptoms of a phototoxicity reaction such as a sensation of skin burning, redness, swelling, blisters, rash, itching, or dermatitis.\n- Exposure to direct or indirect sunlight (even when using sunscreens or sunblocks) should be avoided while taking lomefloxacin and for several days following therapy. Lomefloxacin therapy should be discontinued immediately at the first signs or symptoms of phototoxicity. Risk of phototoxicity may be reduced by taking lomefloxacin in the evening.\n\n【16】 ### Seizures\n- Convulsions have been reported in patients receiving lomefloxacin. Whether the convulsions were directly related to lomefloxacin administration has not yet been established. However, convulsions, increased intracranial pressure, and toxic psychoses have been reported in patients receiving other quinolones. Nevertheless, lomefloxacin has been associated with a possible increased risk of seizures compared to other quinolones. Some of these may occur with a relative absence of predisposing factors. Quinolones may also cause central nervous system (CNS) stimulation, which may lead to tremors, restlessness, lightheadedness, confusion, and hallucinations. If any of these reactions occurs in patients receiving lomefloxacin, the drug should be discontinued and appropriate measures instituted Psychiatric disturbances, agitation, anxiety, and sleep disorders may be more common with lomefloxacin than other products in the quinolone class.\n\n【17】 ### Infections\n- The safety and efficacy of lomefloxacin in the treatment of acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis due to S pneumoniae have not been demonstrated. This product should not be used empirically in the treatment of acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis when it is probable that S pneumoniae is a causative pathogen.\n\n【18】 ### Hypersensitivity Reactions\n- Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactoid or anaphylactic) reactions, some following the first dose, have been reported in patients receiving quinolone therapy. Some reactions were accompanied by cardiovascular collapse, loss of consciousness, tingling, pharyngeal or facial edema, dyspnea, urticaria, or itching. Only a few of these patients had a history of previous hypersensitivity reactions. Serious hypersensitivity reactions have also been reported following treatment with lomefloxacin. If an allergic reaction to lomefloxacin occurs, discontinue the drug. Serious acute hypersensitivity reactions may require immediate emergency treatment with epinephrine. Oxygen, intravenous fluids, antihistamines, corticosteroids, pressor amines, and airway management, including intubation, should be administered as indicated.\n\n【19】 ### QT interval prolongation/torsades de pointes\n- Rare cases of torsades de pointes have been spontaneously reported during post-marketing surveillance in patients receiving quinolones, including lomefloxacin. These rare cases were associated with one or more of the following factors: age over 60, female gender, underlying cardiac disease, and/or use of multiple medications. Lomefloxacin should be avoided in patients with known prolongation of the QT interval, patients with uncorrected hypokalemia, and patients receiving class IA (quinidine, procainamide), or class III (amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic agents.\n\n【20】 ### Peripheral neuropathy\n- Rare cases of sensory or sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy affecting small and/or large axons resulting in paresthesias, hypoesthesias, dysesthesias and weakness have been reported in patients receiving quinolones, including lomefloxacin. Lomefloxacin should be discontinued if the patient experiences symptoms of neuropathy including pain, burning, tingling, numbness, and/or weakness, or is found to have deficits in light touch, pain, temperature, position sense, vibratory sensation, and/or motor strength in order to prevent the development of an irreversible condition.\n\n【21】 ### Tendon effects\n- Ruptures of the shoulder, hand, Achilles tendon or other tendons that required surgical repair or resulted in prolonged disability have been reported in patients receiving quinolones, including lomefloxacin. Postmarketing surveillance reports indicate that this risk may be increased in patients receiving concomitant corticosteroids, especially the elderly. Lomefloxacin should be discontinued if the patient experiences pain, inflammation, or rupture of a tendon. Patients should rest and refrain from exercise until the diagnosis of tendonitis or tendon rupture has been excluded. Tendon rupture can occur during or after therapy with quinolones, including lomefloxacin.\n\n【22】 ## Clinical Trials Experience\nIn clinical trials, most of the adverse events reported were mild to moderate in severity and transient in nature. During these clinical investigations, 5,623 patients received Maxaquin. In 2.2% of the patients, lomefloxacin was discontinued because of adverse events, primarily involving the gastrointestinal system (0.7%), skin (0.7%), or CNS (0.5%).\n\n【23】 ### Adverse clinical events\nThe events with the highest incidence (≥ 1%) in patients, regardless of relationship to drug, were headache (3.6%), nausea (3.5%), photosensitivity (2.3%), dizziness (2.1%), diarrhea (1.4%), and abdominal pain (1.2%).\nAdditional clinical events reported in < 1% of patients treated with Maxaquin, regardless of relationship to drug, are listed below:\n- Autonomic: increased sweating, dry mouth, flushing, syncope.\n- Body as a whole: fatigue, back pain, malaise, asthenia, chest pain, face edema, hot flashes, influenza-like symptoms, edema, chills, allergic reaction, anaphylactoid reaction, decreased heat tolerance.\n- Cardiovascular: tachycardia, hypertension, hypotension, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, cardiac failure, bradycardia, arrhythmia, phlebitis, pulmonary embolism, extrasystoles, cerebrovascular disorder, cyanosis, cardiomyopathy.\n- Central and peripheral nervous system: tremor, vertigo, paresthesias, twitching, hypertonia, convulsions, hyperkinesia, coma.\n- Gastrointestinal: dyspepsia, vomiting, flatulence, constipation, gastrointestinal bleeding, dysphagia, stomatitis, tongue discoloration, gastrointestinal inflammation.\n- Hearing: earache, tinnitus.\n- Hematologic: purpura, lymphadenopathy, thrombocythemia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, increased fibrinolysis.\n- Metabolic: thirst, hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, gout.\n- Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, myalgia, leg cramps.\n- Ophthalmologic: abnormal vision, conjunctivitis, photophobia, eye pain, abnormal lacrimation.\n- Psychiatric: insomnia, nervousness, somnolence, anorexia, depression, confusion, agitation, increased appetite, depersonalization, paranoid reaction, anxiety, paroniria, abnormal thinking, concentration impairment.\n- Reproductive system:\nFemale: vaginal moniliasis, vaginitis, leukorrhea, menstrual disorder, perineal pain, intermenstrual bleeding.\nMale: epididymitis, orchitis.\n- Resistance mechanism: viral infection, moniliasis, fungal infection.\n- Respiratory: respiratory infection, rhinitis, pharyngitis, dyspnea, cough, epistaxis, bronchospasm, respiratory disorder, increased sputum, stridor, respiratory depression.\n- Skin/Allergic: pruritus, rash, urticaria, skin exfoliation, bullous eruption, eczema, skin disorder, acne, skin discoloration, skin ulceration, angioedema.\n- Special senses: taste perversion.\n- Urinary: hematuria, micturition disorder, dysuria, strangury, anuria.\n\n【24】 ### Adverse laboratory events\nChanges in laboratory parameters, listed as adverse events, without regard to drug relationship include:\n- Hematologic: monocytosis (0.2%), eosinophilia (0.1%), leukopenia (0.1%), leukocytosis (0.1%).\n- Renal: elevated BUN (0.1%), hypokalemia (0.1%), increased creatinine (0.1%).\n- Hepatic: elevations of ALT (SGPT) (0.4%), AST (SGOT) (0.3%), bilirubin (0.1%), alkaline phosphatase (0.1%).\n- Additional laboratory changes occurring in < 0.1% in the clinical studies included: elevation of serum gamma glutamyl transferase, decrease in total protein or albumin, prolongation of prothrombin time, anemia, decrease in hemoglobin, thrombocythemia, thrombocytopenia, abnormalities of urine specific gravity or serum electrolytes, increased albumin, elevated ESR, albuminuria, macrocytosis.\n\n【25】 ### Post-marketing adverse events\n- Adverse events reported from worldwide marketing experience with lomefloxacin are: anaphylaxis, cardiopulmonary arrest, laryngeal or pulmonary edema, ataxia, cerebral thrombosis, hallucinations, painful oral mucosa, pseudomembranous colitis, hemolytic anemia, hepatitis, tendinitis, diplopia, photophobia, phobia, exfoliative dermatitis, hyperpigmentation, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, dysgeusia, interstitial nephritis, polyuria, renal failure, urinary retention, and vasculitis.\n\n【26】 ### Quinolone-class adverse events\n- Additional quinolone-class adverse events include: peripheral neuropathy, torsades de pointes, erythema nodosum, hepatic necrosis, possible exacerbation of myasthenia gravis, dysphasia, nystagmus, intestinal perforation, manic reaction, renal calculi, acidosis and hiccough.\n- Laboratory adverse events include: agranulocytosis, elevation of serum triglycerides, elevation of serum cholesterol, elevation of blood glucose, elevation of serum potassium, albuminuria, candiduria, and crystalluria.\n\n【27】 ### Theophylline\n- In three pharmacokinetic studies including 46 normal, healthy subjects, theophylline clearance and concentration were not significantly altered by the addition of lomefloxacin. In clinical studies where patients were on chronic theophylline therapy, lomefloxacin had no measurable effect on the mean distribution of theophylline concentrations or the mean estimates of theophylline clearance. Though individual theophylline levels fluctuated, there were no clinically significant symptoms of drug interaction.\n\n【28】 ### Antacids and sucralfate\n- Sucralfate and antacids containing magnesium or aluminum, as well as formulations containing divalent and trivalent cations such as Videx (didanosine), chewable/buffered tablets or the pediatric powder for oral solution can form chelation complexes with lomefloxacin and interfere with its bioavailability. Sucralfate administered 2 hours before lomefloxacin resulted in a slower absorption (mean Cmax decreased by 30% and mean Tmax increased by 1 hour) and a lesser extent of absorption (mean AUC decreased by approximately 25%). Magnesium- and aluminum-containing antacids, administered concomitantly with lomefloxacin, significantly decreased the bioavailability (48%) of lomefloxacin. Separating the doses of antacid and lomefloxacin minimizes this decrease in bioavailability; therefore, administration of these agents should precede lomefloxacin dosing by 4 hours or follow lomefloxacin dosing by at least 2 hours.\n\n【29】 ### Caffeine\n- Two hundred mg of caffeine (equivalent to 1 to 3 cups of American coffee) was administered to 16 normal, healthy volunteers who had achieved steady-state blood concentrations of lomefloxacin after being dosed at 400 mg qd. This did not result in any statistically or clinically relevant changes in the pharmacokinetic parameters of either caffeine or its major metabolite, paraxanthine. No data are available on potential interactions in individuals who consume greater than 200 mg of caffeine per day or in those, such as the geriatric population, who are generally believed to be more susceptible to the development of drug-induced CNS-related adverse effects. Other quinolones have demonstrated moderate to marked interference with the metabolism of caffeine, resulting in a reduced clearance, a prolongation of plasma half-life, and an increase in symptoms that accompany high levels of caffeine.\n\n【30】 ### Cimetidine\n- Cimetidine has been demonstrated to interfere with the elimination of other quinolones. This interference has resulted in significant increases in half-life and AUC. The interaction between lomefloxacin and cimetidine has not been studied.\n\n【31】 ### Cyclosporine\n- Elevated serum levels of cyclosporine have been reported with concomitant use of cyclosporine with other members of the quinolone class. Interaction between lomefloxacin and cyclosporine has not been studied.\n\n【32】 ### Omeprazole\n- No clinically significant changes in lomefloxacin pharmacokinetics (AUC, Cmax, or Tmax) were observed when a single dose of lomefloxacin 400 mg was given after multiple doses of omeprazole (20 mg qd) in 13 healthy volunteers. Changes in omeprazole pharmacokinetics were not studied.\n\n【33】 ### Phenytoin\n- No significant differences were observed in mean phenytoin AUC, Cmax, Cmin or Tmax (although Cmax increased by 11%) when extended phenytoin sodium capsules (100 mg tid) were coadministered with lomefloxacin (400 mg qd) for five days in 15 healthy males. Lomefloxacin is unlikely to have a significant effect on phenytoin metabolism.\n\n【34】 ### Probenecid\n- Probenecid slows the renal elimination of lomefloxacin. An increase of 63% in the mean AUC and increases of 50% and 4%, respectively, in the mean Tmax and mean Cmax were noted in 1 study of 6 individuals.\n\n【35】 ### Terfenadine\n- No clinically significant changes occurred in heart rate or corrected QT intervals, or in terfenadine metabolite or lomefloxacin pharmacokinetics, during concurrent administration of lomefloxacin and terfenadine at steady-state in 28 healthy males.\n\n【36】 ### Warfarin\n- Quinolones may enhance the effects of the oral anticoagulant, warfarin, or its derivatives. When these products are administered concomitantly, prothrombin or other suitable coagulation tests should be monitored closely. However, no clinically or statistically significant differences in prothrombin time ratio or warfarin enantiomer pharmacokinetics were observed in a small study of 7 healthy males who received both warfarin and lomefloxacin under steady-state conditions.\n\n【37】 ### Pregnancy\nPregnancy Category (FDA): C\n- Reproductive function studies have been performed in rats at doses up to 8 times the recommended human dose based on mg/m2 (34 times the recommended human dose based on mg/kg), and no impaired fertility or harm to the fetus was reported due to lomefloxacin. Increased incidence of fetal loss in monkeys has been observed at approximately 3 to 6 times the recommended human dose based on mg/m2 (6 to 12 times the recommended human dose based on mg/kg). No teratogenicity has been observed in rats and monkeys at up to 16 times the recommended human dose exposure. In the rabbit, maternal toxicity and associated fetotoxicity, decreased placental weight, and variations of the coccygeal vertebrae occurred at doses 2 times the recommended human exposure based on mg/m2. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Lomefloxacin should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\nThere is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Lomefloxacin hydrochloride in women who are pregnant.\n\n【38】 ### Labor and Delivery\nThere is no FDA guidance on use of Lomefloxacin hydrochloride during labor and delivery.\n\n【39】 ### Nursing Mothers\n- It is not known whether lomefloxacin is excreted in human milk. However, it is known that other drugs of this class are excreted in human milk and that lomefloxacin is excreted in the milk of lactating rats. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from lomefloxacin in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\n\n【40】 ### Pediatric Use\n- The safety and effectiveness of lomefloxacin in pediatric patients and adolescents less than 18 years of age have not been established. Lomefloxacin causes arthropathy in juvenile animals of several species.\n\n【41】 ### Geriatic Use\n- Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of lomefloxacin, 25% were ≥ 65 years and 9% were ≥ 75 years. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.\n- This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.\n\n【42】 ### Gender\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Lomefloxacin hydrochloride with respect to specific gender populations.\n\n【43】 ### Race\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Lomefloxacin hydrochloride with respect to specific racial populations.\n\n【44】 ### Renal Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Lomefloxacin hydrochloride in patients with renal impairment.\n\n【45】 ### Hepatic Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Lomefloxacin hydrochloride in patients with hepatic impairment.\n\n【46】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Lomefloxacin hydrochloride in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n\n【47】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\nThere is no FDA guidance one the use of Lomefloxacin hydrochloride in patients who are immunocompromised.\n\n【48】 ### Administration\nThere is limited information regarding Lomefloxacin hydrochloride Administration in the drug label.\n\n【49】 ### Monitoring\nThere is limited information regarding Lomefloxacin hydrochloride Monitoring in the drug label.\n\n【50】 #IV Compatibility\nThere is limited information regarding the compatibility of Lomefloxacin hydrochloride and IV administrations.\n\n【51】 #Overdosage\n- Information on overdosage in humans is limited. In the event of acute overdosage, the stomach should be emptied by inducing vomiting or by gastric lavage, and the patient should be carefully observed and given supportive treatment. Adequate hydration must be maintained. Hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is unlikely to aid in the removal of lomefloxacin as < 3% is removed by these modalities.\n- Clinical signs of acute toxicity in rodents progressed from salivation to tremors, decreased activity, dyspnea, and clonic convulsions prior to death. These signs were noted in rats and mice as lomefloxacin doses were increased.\n\n【52】 ## Mechanism of Action\n- The bactericidal action of lomefloxacin results from interference with the activity of the bacterial enzyme DNA gyrase, which is needed for the transcription and replication of bacterial DNA. The minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) generally does not exceed the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) by more than a factor of 2, except for staphylococci, which usually have MBCs 2 to 4 times the MIC.\n\n【53】 ## Structure\n- Lomefloxacin HCl, a difluoroquinolone, is the monohydrochloride salt of (±)-1-ethyl-6,8-difluoro-1,4-dihydro-7-(3-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-4-oxo-3-quinolinecarboxylic acid. Its empirical formula is C17H19F2N3O3HCl, and its structural formula is:\n\n【54】 ## Pharmacodynamics\nThere is limited information regarding Lomefloxacin hydrochloride Pharmacodynamics in the drug label.\n\n【55】 ### Pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers\n- In 6 fasting healthy male volunteers, approximately 95% to 98% of a single oral dose of lomefloxacin was absorbed. Absorption was rapid following single doses of 200 and 400 mg (Tmax 0.8 to 1.4 hours). Mean plasma concentration increased proportionally between 100 and 400 mg as shown below:\n- In 6 healthy male volunteers administered 400 mg of lomefloxacin on an empty stomach qd for 7 days, the following mean pharmacokinetic parameter values were obtained:\n- The elimination half-life in 8 subjects with normal renal function was approximately 8 hours. At 24 hours postdose, subjects with normal renal function receiving single doses of 200 or 400 mg had mean plasma lomefloxacin concentrations of 0.10 and 0.24 µg/mL, respectively. Steady-state concentrations were achieved within 48 hours of initiating therapy with one-a-day dosing. There was no drug accumulation with single-daily dosing in patients with normal renal function.\n- Approximately 65% of an orally administered dose was excreted in the urine as unchanged drug in patients with normal renal function. Following a 400-mg dose of lomefloxacin administered qd for 7 days, the mean urine concentration 4 hours postdose was in excess of 300 µg/mL. The mean urine concentration exceeded 35 µg/mL for at least 24 hours after dosing.\n- Following a single 400-mg dose, the solubility of lomefloxacin in urine usually exceeded its peak urinary concentration 2- to 6-fold. In this study, urine pH affected the solubility of lomefloxacin with solubilities ranging from 7.8 mg/mL at pH 5.2, to 2.4 mg/mL at pH 6.5, and 3.03 mg/mL at pH 8.12.\n- When lomefloxacin and food were administered concomitantly, the rate of drug absorption was delayed (Tmax increased to 2 hours , Cmax decreased by 18%), and the extent of absorption (AUC) was decreased by 12%.\n- In 16 healthy elderly volunteers (61 to 76 years of age) with normal renal function for their age, the half-life of lomefloxacin (mean of 8 hours) and its peak plasma concentration (mean of 4.2 µg/mL) following a single 400-mg dose were similar to those in 8 younger subjects dosed with a single 400-mg dose. Thus, drug absorption appears unaffected in the elderly. Plasma clearance was, however, reduced in this elderly population by approximately 25%, and the AUC was increased by approximately 33%. This slower elimination most likely reflects the decreased renal function normally observed in the geriatric population.\nIn 8 patients with creatinine clearance (ClCr) between 10 and 40 mL/min/1.73 m2, the mean AUC after a single 400-mg dose of lomefloxacin increased 335% over the AUC demonstrated in patients with a ClCr> 80 mL/min/1.73 m2. Also, in these patients, the mean t1/2 increased to 21 hours. In 8 patients with ClCr 80 mL/min/1.73 m2. In these patients with ClCr< 10 mL/min/1.73 m2, the mean t1/2 increased to 45 hours. The plasma clearance of lomefloxacin was closely correlated with creatinine clearance, ranging from 31 mL/min/1.73 m2 when creatinine clearance was zero to 271 mL/min/1.73 m2 at a normal creatinine clearance of 110 mL/min/1.73 m2. Peak lomefloxacin concentrations were not affected by the degree of renal function when single doses of lomefloxacin were administered. Adjustment of dosage schedules for patients with such decreases in renal function is warranted.\n- Lomefloxacin is minimally metabolized although 5 metabolites have been identified in human urine. The glucuronide metabolite is found in the highest concentration and accounts for approximately 9% of the administered dose. The other 4 metabolites together account for < 0.5% of the dose.\n- Approximately 10% of an oral dose was recovered as unchanged drug in the feces.\n- Serum protein binding of lomefloxacin is approximately 10%.\n- The following are mean tissue- or fluid-to-plasma ratios of lomefloxacin following oral administration. Studies have not been conducted to assess the penetration of lomefloxacin into human cerebrospinal fluid.\n\n【56】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\nThere is limited information regarding Lomefloxacin hydrochloride Nonclinical Toxicology in the drug label.\n\n【57】 #How Supplied\n- Maxaquin is supplied as a scored, film-coated tablet containing the equivalent of 400 mg of lomefloxacin base present as the hydrochloride.

This involves placing a device under the skin of the chest, which delivers electrical pulses to make the heart contract more strongly.\n\n【2】 #Recommendations\nThe evidence on cardiac contractility modulation device implantation for heart failure raises no major safety concerns. However, the evidence on efficacy is inadequate in quantity and quality. Therefore, this procedure should only be used in the context of research.\nFurther research should ideally be in the form of randomised controlled trials Outcomes should include ejection fraction, oxygen consumption, New York Heart Association classification and patient-reported outcomes, including quality of life\n\n【3】 #The condition, current treatments and procedure\n\n【4】 #The condition\nHeart failure is a complex clinical syndrome of symptoms and signs that happen when the heart is not working well enough, leading to reduced blood flow to body tissues. It can lead to oedema in the lungs (causing breathlessness) and swelling of the legs. Other symptoms include reduced ability to exercise, fatigue and malaise. Heart failure can be caused by structural or functional abnormalities of the heart.\n\n【5】 #Current treatments\nNICE's guideline describes the diagnosis and management of chronic heart failure in adults. Treatments for heart failure include drugs to improve heart function, cardiac rehabilitation, cardiac resynchronisation therapy and cardiac transplantation. Cardiac contractility modulation device implantation may be an option for people with advanced heart failure that hasn't responded to conventional therapy.\n\n【6】 #The procedure\nCardiac contractility modulation device implantation for heart failure is usually done under local anaesthesia. A device similar to a pacemaker is implanted in the right or left pectoral region and is connected to 2 standard pacemaker leads that are threaded through veins into the right ventricle. The electrodes in the right ventricle are placed on the ventricular septum at least 2 cm apart. These sense ventricular activity and deliver cardiac contractility modulation signals. An optional additional lead may be used to sense atrial activity (usually placed in the right atrial appendage). In contrast to a pacemaker or a defibrillator, the system is designed to modulate the strength of contraction of the heart muscle rather than the rhythm. Pulses are delivered at regular intervals throughout the day.\nThe device is recharged using a home-based charger system, typically on a weekly basis. Charging sessions last about 40 to 60 minutes.\nThe aim is to improve the heart's contractility, therefore improving a person's ability to exercise and quality of life.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

The evidence on safety shows that serious complications may occur as a result of the procedure. The long-term immunosuppression required is also associated with a risk of adverse events. In units with established experience in allogeneic pancreatic islet cell transplantation, the procedure may be used with normal arrangements for clinical governance .\nDuring consent, clinicians should ensure that patients understand the potential complications of the procedure and the uncertainty about its efficacy in the long term. They should provide patients with clear, written information. In addition, use of the Institute's information for patients ('Understanding NICE guidance') is recommended.\nPatient selection for this procedure should involve a multidisciplinary team. Selection criteria should take into account that the procedure is particularly indicated for patients with hypoglycaemia unawareness and/or those already on immunosuppressive therapy because of renal transplantation.\nFurther audit and research should address the effect of the procedure on quality of life and its long-term efficacy, particularly in relation to the complications of diabetes #The procedure\n\n【2】 #Indications and current treatments\nType 1 diabetes mellitus is caused by insufficient insulin secretion and is treated with exogenous insulin. This may result in hypoglycaemic episodes, which are usually easily recognised and treated. In a few people, hypoglycaemia occurs without warning ('hypoglycaemia unawareness'), with life-threatening consequences.\n\n【3】 #Outline of the procedure\nIslet cells are obtained from pancreata of brain-dead donors (two are often required). The patient is started on immunosuppressive therapy, which continues for the long term. Under local anaesthesia (sometimes with sedation) and using imaging guidance, a catheter is inserted percutaneously into the portal vein and the grafted islet cells infused into the liver. More than one infusion may be required.\nSections 2.3 and 2.4 describe efficacy and safety outcomes which were available in the published literature and which the Committee considered as part of the evidence about this procedure\n\n【4】 #Efficacy\nA registry study of 112 patients reported that a severe hypoglycaemic episode was experienced by 5% in the year following transplantation compared with 82% in the year prior to transplantation (numbers not reported). In a case series of 36 patients, there were no hypoglycaemic episodes among patients with residual graft function during follow-ups of 1–12 months. A case series of 65 patients reported significantly reduced hypoglycaemia unawareness and improved diabetic control compared with baseline for up to 4 years after transplantation (numbers not reported).\nIn the registry study of 112 patients, 67% and 58% were insulin independent at 6 months and 1 year after transplantation, respectively (numbers not reported). For patients who remained insulin dependent, insulin requirements were reduced by a mean of 57% from baseline at 6 months and 69% at 1 year. In this study, 13% (15/112) of patients had complete graft failure. In the case series of 36 patients, 58% (21/36) achieved insulin independence during a median follow-up of 41 months. However, 76% (16/21) were insulin dependent again after 2 years.\nA non-randomised controlled trial of 99 patients who had the procedure reported that fear of hypoglycaemic episodes as measured by the 'Hypoglycaemia fear survey' improved significantly following the first infusion of islet cells (p < 0.00001).\nThe Specialist Advisers considered key efficacy outcomes to include reduction in hypoglycaemic episodes, improved glycaemic control, normalised C-peptide levels (indicating graft function) and insulin independence.\n\n【5】 #Safety\nTwo case series of 65 and 51 patients reported procedure-related intraperitoneal bleeding in 23% (15/65), and 8% (4/51; 7 haemorrhage episodes) of patients. A case series of 36 patients reported intraperitoneal bleeding during 9% (7/77) of infusions. Portal (or branch) vein thrombosis was reported in 8% (5/65), 4% (2/51) and 3% (2/36) of patients, and gall bladder puncture requiring laparotomy in 3% (2/65 and 1/36) of patients.\nIn the registry study of 112 patients, 77 serious adverse events were reported; 22% (17/77) were life-threatening and 58% (45/77) required hospitalisation. Overall, 95% (73/77) of adverse events resolved without residual effects. The authors judged that 17% of all adverse events were related to the infusion procedure and 27% to immunosuppression (numbers not reported).\nA case report described a patient who died of West Nile virus encephalitis – a potential infection in immunosuppressed patients.\nThe Specialist Advisers considered theoretical adverse events to include haemorrhage, portal vein thrombosis, portal hypertension, immunosuppression-related complications and transmission of donor material containing infectious agents or neoplastic cells.\n\n【6】 #Other comments\nThe Committee noted that immunosuppressive regimens and technology for harvesting islet cells continue to evolve.\nThe Committee noted that the National Commissioning Group (NCG), which has a remit to commission highly specialised national services for very rare conditions or treatments for the population of England, has developed service standards for pancreatic islet cell transplantation that are used as the basis for designation and commissioning of these services. Scottish residents also have access to the service under an agreement between the NCG and the National Services Division, Scotland. Health Commission Wales has a separate agreement with the provider for Welsh residents. The Regional Medical Services Consortium (RMSC) commissions specialist regional services for the population of Northern Ireland. The RMSC will commission outside the region, on an individual basis, in cases for which services are not available in Northern Ireland.\nThis guidance requires that clinicians or units undertaking the procedure for the first time make special arrangements for audit. NICE has identified relevant audit criteria and developed an audit tool (which is for use at local discretion).\nNICE has issued a clinical guideline on type 1 diabetes and technology appraisals guidance on insulin pump therapy for type 1 diabetes and long-acting insulin analogues for type 1 and 2 diabetes. NICE is developing interventional procedures guidance on autologous pancreatic islet cell transplantation for prevention of diabetes after pancreatectomy .\n\n【7】 #\nThe evidence considered by the Interventional Procedures Advisory Committee is described in the overview.\n\n【8】 #Information for patients\nNICE has produced information on this procedure for patients and carers ('Understanding NICE guidance'). It explains the nature of the procedure and the decision made, and has been written with patient consent in mind\n\n【9】 #About this guidance\nNICE interventional procedure guidance makes recommendations on the safety and efficacy of the procedure.

Details of patient selection should be clearly documented. Reported outcomes should include the effects of the procedure on symptoms and quality of life, the duration of benefits, and the need for further procedures. All complications should be reported. NICE may review this procedure in the light of longer-term outcomes\n\n【2】 #Indications and current treatments\nBenign prostatic hyperplasia is a common condition that affects older men. It is characterised by an increase in the size of the prostate, which is caused by an increased number of stromal and epithelial cells. Benign prostatic hyperplasia can cause lower urinary tract symptoms including hesitancy during micturition, interrupted or decreased urine stream, nocturia, incomplete voiding and urinary retention.\nMild symptoms are usually managed conservatively. Drugs such as alpha blockers and 5‑alpha-reductase inhibitors can be used. If symptoms are more severe, then surgical treatments may be used including transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), transurethral vaporisation of the prostate, or holmium laser enucleation of the prostate #The procedure\nThe aim of insertion of prostatic urethral lift implants for lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia is to secure the prostatic lobes in retracted positions such that the lumen of the urethra is increased. The procedure is designed to cause less tissue injury than surgical resection or thermal ablation, and it is claimed to reduce the risk of complications such as sexual dysfunction and incontinence.\n\n【3】 In a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of 206 patients comparing 140 patients treated by prostatic urethral lift against 66 patients treated by a sham procedure there was a significant difference in mean change in American Urological Association Symptom Index (AUASI) score (scores range from 0 to 35; higher score indicating greater severity) at 3‑month follow-up. The mean score decreased by 11 points at follow-up from a baseline score of 22 in patients treated by prostatic urethral lift and by 6 points at follow-up from a baseline score of 24 in patients treated by the sham procedure (p=0.003 difference between the groups).\nA case series of 64 patients reported a significant improvement in International Prostate Symptom Score (scale 0 to 35; higher score indicating more severe symptoms) at follow-up intervals from 2 weeks to 24 months. The mean score improved from 22 at baseline to 13 at 2‑year follow‑up (n=33; p<0.001).\nThe RCT of 206 patients reported a significant improvement in mean urinary flow rate at 3 months. The mean improvement in urinary flow was 4 ml/s in patients treated by prostatic urethral lift and 2 ml/s in patients treated by the sham procedure (from 8 ml/s at baseline for both groups; p=0.005 difference between the groups).\nA case series of 19 patients reported a significant reduction in mean post-voiding residual volume, from 147 ml at baseline to 46 ml at 3‑month follow‑up (n=11; p=0.01).\nThe RCT of 206 patients reported retreatment at 1 year in 5% (7/140) of patients treated by prostatic urethral lift. Five patients underwent further prostatic urethral lift treatment because of insufficient response and 2 patients were treated by transurethral prostate resection (TURP) or laser vaporisation (reasons for retreatment not reported). The case series of 64 patients reported that 20% (13/64) of patients had further procedures. Four patients had TURP or photoselective vaporisation of the prostate within 7 months. Nine patients with symptomatic improvement after the initial procedure had TURP (n=4), photoselective vaporisation (n=4) or prostatic urethral lift (n=1) (at a mean of 13 months after the procedure) because of recurrent lower urinary tract symptoms.\nThe specialist advisers listed key efficacy outcomes as symptom improvement, improvement in quality of life, reducing or stopping medical therapy, flow improvement, reduction in post-void residual volume and maintenance of sexual and ejaculatory function\n\n【4】 #Safety\nUrinary tract infections (within 3 months of the procedure) were reported in 3% (4/140) of patients treated by prostatic urethral lift and 2% (1/66) of patients treated by a sham procedure in the randomised controlled trial of 206 patients (level of significance not reported).\nOrchitis was reported in 3% (3/102) of patients in a case series of 102 patients (duration and timing not reported).\nSymptoms of prostatitis (penile and perineal discomfort, pain on erection and ejaculation) were reported in 1 patient in the case series of 64 patients (treated with antibiotics).\nTransient urge incontinence was reported in 8% (5/64) of patients in the case series of 64 patients (resolved within 8 days).\nIncomplete voiding (within 30 days of the procedure) was reported in 1 patient in the case series of 19 patients (lasting 42 days).\nErectile dysfunction was reported within 30 days of the procedure in 11% (2/19) of patients in the case series of 19 patients. This spontaneously resolved after 23 days in 1 patient and 127 days in the other patient.\n\n【5】 #Information for patients\nNICE has produced information on this procedure for patients and carers (Information for the public).

{"seq_id": "ea53e5f8-a022-443b-bb98-9366babf11df", "title": null, "text": "【0】 Interferon alfa-2b clinical pharmacology\n\n【1】 ## General\nThe interferons are a family of naturally occurring small proteins and glycoproteins with molecular weights of approximately 15,000 to 27,600 daltons produced and secreted by cells in response to viral infections and to synthetic or biological inducers.\n\n【2】 ### Preclinical Pharmacology\nInterferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface. Once bound to the cell membrane, interferons initiate a complex sequence of intracellular events. In vitro studies demonstrated that these include the induction of certain enzymes, suppression of cell proliferation, immunomodulating activities such as enhancement of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of lymphocytes for target cells, and inhibition of virus replication in virus-infected cells.\nIn a study using human hepatoblastoma cell line HB 611, the in vitro antiviral activity of alpha interferon was demonstrated by its inhibition of hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication.\nThe correlation between these in vitro data and the clinical results is unknown. Any of these activities might contribute to interferon's therapeutic effects.\n\n【3】 ### Pharmacokinetics\nThe pharmacokinetics of INTRON A were studied in 12 healthy male volunteers following single doses of 5 million IU/m2 administered intramuscularly, subcutaneously, and as a 30-minute intravenous infusion in a crossover design.\nThe mean serum INTRON A concentrations following intramuscular and subcutaneous injections were comparable. The maximum serum concentrations obtained via these routes were approximately 18 to 116 IU/mL and occurred 3 to 12 hours after administration. The elimination half-life of INTRON A following both intramuscular and subcutaneous injections was approximately 2 to 3 hours. Serum concentrations were undetectable by 16 hours after the injections.\nAfter intravenous administration, serum INTRON A concentrations peaked (135–273 IU/mL) by the end of the 30-minute infusion, then declined at a slightly more rapid rate than after intramuscular or subcutaneous drug administration, becoming undetectable 4 hours after the infusion. The elimination half-life was approximately 2 hours.\nUrine INTRON A concentrations following a single dose (5 million IU/m2) were not detectable after any of the parenteral routes of administration. This result was expected since preliminary studies with isolated and perfused rabbit kidneys have shown that the kidney may be the main site of interferon catabolism.\nThere are no pharmacokinetic data available for the intralesional route of administration.\n\n【4】 ### Serum Neutralizing Antibodies\nIn INTRON A-treated patients tested for antibody activity in clinical trials, serum anti-interferon neutralizing antibodies were detected in 0% (0/90) of patients with hairy cell leukemia, 0.8% (2/260) of patients treated intralesionally for condylomata acuminata, and 4% (1/24) of patients with AIDS-Related Kaposi's Sarcoma. Serum neutralizing antibodies have been detected in less than 3% of patients treated with higher INTRON A doses in malignancies other than hairy cell leukemia or AIDS-Related Kaposi's Sarcoma. The clinical significance of the appearance of serum anti-interferon neutralizing activity in these indications is not known.\nSerum anti-interferon neutralizing antibodies were detected in 7% (12/168) of patients either during treatment or after completing 12 to 48 weeks of treatment with 3 million IU TIW of INTRON A therapy for chronic hepatitis C and in 13% (6/48) of patients who received INTRON A therapy for chronic hepatitis B at 5 million IU QD for 4 months, and in 3% (1/33) of patients treated at 10 million IU TIW. Serum anti-interferon neutralizing antibodies were detected in 9% (5/53) of pediatric patients who received INTRON A therapy for chronic hepatitis B at 6 million IU/m2 TIW. Among all chronic hepatitis B or C patients, pediatrics and adults with detectable serum neutralizing antibodies, the titers detected were low (22/24 with titers less than or equal to 1:40 and 2/24 with titers less than or equal to 1:160). The appearance of serum anti-interferon neutralizing activity did not appear to affect safety or efficacy.\n\n【5】 ## Hairy Cell Leukemia\nIn clinical trials in patients with hairy cell leukemia, there was depression of hematopoiesis during the first 1 to 2 months of INTRON A treatment, resulting in reduced numbers of circulating red and white blood cells, and platelets. Subsequently, both splenectomized and nonsplenectomized patients achieved substantial and sustained improvements in granulocytes, platelets, and hemoglobin levels in 75% of treated patients and at least some improvement (minor responses) occurred in 90%. INTRON A treatment resulted in a decrease in bone marrow hypercellularity and hairy cell infiltrates. The hairy cell index (HCI), which represents the percent of bone marrow cellularity times the percent of hairy cell infiltrate, was greater than or equal to 50% at the beginning of the study in 87% of patients. The percentage of patients with such an HCI decreased to 25% after 6 months and to 14% after 1 year. These results indicate that even though hematologic improvement had occurred earlier, prolonged INTRON A treatment may be required to obtain maximal reduction in tumor cell infiltrates in the bone marrow.\nThe percentage of patients with hairy cell leukemia who required red blood cell or platelet transfusions decreased significantly during treatment and the percentage of patients with confirmed and serious infections declined as granulocyte counts improved. Reversal of splenomegaly and of clinically significant hypersplenism was demonstrated in some patients.\nA study was conducted to assess the effects of extended INTRON A treatment on duration of response for patients who responded to initial therapy. In this study, 126 responding patients were randomized to receive additional INTRON A treatment for 6 months or observation for a comparable period, after 12 months of initial INTRON A therapy. During this 6-month period, 3% (2/66) of INTRON A-treated patients relapsed compared with 18% (11/60) who were not treated. This represents a significant difference in time to relapse in favor of continued INTRON A treatment (P=0.006/0.01, Log Rank/Wilcoxon). Since a small proportion of the total population had relapsed, median time to relapse could not be estimated in either group. A similar pattern in relapses was seen when all randomized treatment, including that beyond 6 months, and available follow-up data were assessed. The 15% (10/66) relapses among INTRON A patients occurred over a significantly longer period of time than the 40% (24/60) with observation (P=0.0002/0.0001, Log Rank/Wilcoxon). Median time to relapse was estimated, using the Kaplan-Meier method, to be 6.8 months in the observation group but could not be estimated in the INTRON A group.\nSubsequent follow-up with a median time of approximately 40 months demonstrated an overall survival of 87.8%. In a comparable historical control group followed for 24 months, overall median survival was approximately 40%.\n\n【6】 ## Malignant Melanoma\nThe safety and efficacy of INTRON A was evaluated as adjuvant to surgical treatment in patients with melanoma who were free of disease (post surgery) but at high risk for systemic recurrence. These included patients with lesions of Breslow thickness greater than 4 mm, or patients with lesions of any Breslow thickness with primary or recurrent nodal involvement. In a randomized, controlled trial in 280 patients, 143 patients received INTRON A therapy at 20 million IU/m2 intravenously five times per week for 4 weeks (induction phase) followed by 10 million IU/m2 subcutaneously three times per week for 48 weeks (maintenance phase). In the clinical trial, the median daily INTRON A dose administered to patients was 19.1 million IU/m2 during the induction phase and 9.1 million IU/m2 during the maintenance phase. INTRON A therapy was begun less than or equal to 56 days after surgical resection. The remaining 137 patients were observed.\nINTRON A therapy produced a significant increase in relapse-free and overall survival. Median time to relapse for the INTRON A-treated patients versus observation patients was 1.72 years versus 0.98 years (P<0.01, stratified Log Rank). The estimated 5-year relapse-free survival rate, using the Kaplan-Meier method, was 37% for INTRON A-treated patients versus 26% for observation patients. Median overall survival time for INTRON A-treated patients versus observation patients was 3.82 years versus 2.78 years (P=0.047, stratified Log Rank). The estimated 5-year overall survival rate, using the Kaplan-Meier method, was 46% for INTRON A-treated patients versus 37% for observation patients.\nIn a second study of 642 resected high-risk melanoma patients, subjects were randomized equally to one of three groups: high-dose INTRON A therapy for 1 year (same schedule as above), low-dose INTRON A therapy for 2 years (3 MU/d TIW SC), and observation. Consistent with the earlier trial, high-dose INTRON A therapy demonstrated an improvement in relapse-free survival (3-year estimated RFS 48% versus 41%; median RFS 2.4 versus 1.6 years,P=not significant). Relapse-free survival in the low-dose INTRON A arm was similar to that seen in the observation arm. Neither high-dose nor low-dose INTRON A therapy showed a benefit in overall survival as compared to observation in this study.\n\n【7】 ## Follicular Lymphoma\nThe safety and efficacy of INTRON A in conjunction with CHVP, a combination chemotherapy regimen, was evaluated as initial treatment in patients with clinically aggressive, large tumor burden, Stage III/IV follicular Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma. Large tumor burden was defined by the presence of any one of the following: a nodal or extranodal tumor mass with a diameter of greater than 7 cm; involvement of at least three nodal sites (each with a diameter of greater than 3 cm); systemic symptoms; splenomegaly; serous effusion, orbital or epidural involvement; ureteral compression; or leukemia.\nIn a randomized, controlled trial, 130 patients received CHVP therapy and 135 patients received CHVP therapy plus INTRON A therapy at 5 million IU subcutaneously three times weekly for the duration of 18 months. CHVP chemotherapy consisted of cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2, doxorubicin 25 mg/m2, and teniposide (VM-26) 60 mg/m2, administered intravenously on Day 1 and prednisone at a daily dose of 40 mg/m2 given orally on Days 1 to 5. Treatment consisted of six CHVP cycles administered monthly, followed by an additional six cycles administered every 2 months for 1 year. Patients in both treatment groups received a total of 12 CHVP cycles over 18 months.\n\n【8】 ## Condylomata Acuminata\nCondylomata acuminata (venereal or genital warts) are associated with infections of the human papilloma virus (HPV). The safety and efficacy of INTRON A in the treatment of condylomata acuminata were evaluated in three controlled double-blind clinical trials. In these studies, INTRON A doses of 1 million IU per lesion were administered intralesionally three times a week (TIW), in less than or equal to 5 lesions per patient for 3 weeks. The patients were observed for up to 16 weeks after completion of the full treatment course.\nINTRON A treatment of condylomata was significantly more effective than placebo, as measured by disappearance of lesions, decreases in lesion size, and by an overall change in disease status. Of 192 INTRON A-treated patients and 206 placebo-treated patients who were evaluable for efficacy at the time of best response during the course of the study, 42% of INTRON A patients versus 17% of placebo patients experienced clearing of all treated lesions. Likewise, 24% of INTRON A patients versus 8% of placebo patients experienced marked (75% to less than 100%) reduction in lesion size, 18% versus 9% experienced moderate (50% to 75%) reduction in lesion size, 10% versus 42% had a slight (less than 50%) reduction in lesion size, 5% versus 24% had no change in lesion size, and 0% versus 1% experienced exacerbation (P<0.001).\nIn one of these studies, 43% (54/125) of patients in whom multiple (less than or equal to 3) lesions were treated experienced complete clearing of all treated lesions during the course of the study. Of these patients, 81% remained cleared 16 weeks after treatment was initiated.\nPatients who did not achieve total clearing of all their treated lesions had these same lesions treated with a second course of therapy. During this second course of treatment, 38% to 67% of patients had clearing of all treated lesions. The overall percentage of patients who had cleared all their treated lesions after two courses of treatment ranged from 57% to 85%.\nINTRON A-treated lesions showed improvement within 2 to 4 weeks after the start of treatment in the above study; maximal response to INTRON A therapy was noted 4 to 8 weeks after initiation of treatment.\nThe response to INTRON A therapy was better in patients who had condylomata for shorter durations than in patients with lesions for a longer duration.\nAnother study involved 97 patients in whom three lesions were treated with either an intralesional injection of 1.5 million IU of INTRON A per lesion followed by a topical application of 25% podophyllin, or a topical application of 25% podophyllin alone. Treatment was given once a week for 3 weeks. The combined treatment of INTRON A and podophyllin was shown to be significantly more effective than podophyllin alone, as determined by the number of patients whose lesions cleared. This significant difference in response was evident after the second treatment (Week 3) and continued through 8 weeks post-treatment. At the time of the patient's best response, 67% (33/49) of the INTRON A- and podophyllin-treated patients had all three treated lesions clear while 42% (20/48) of the podophyllin-treated patients had all three clear (P=0.003).\n\n【9】 ## AIDS-Related Kaposi's Sarcoma\nThe safety and efficacy of INTRON A in the treatment of Kaposi's Sarcoma (KS), a common manifestation of the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), were evaluated in clinical trials in 144 patients.\nIn one study, INTRON A doses of 30 million IU/m2 were administered subcutaneously three times per week (TIW) to patients with AIDS-Related KS. Doses were adjusted for patient tolerance. The average weekly dose delivered in the first 4 weeks was 150 million IU; at the end of 12 weeks this averaged 110 million IU/week; and by 24 weeks averaged 75 million IU/week.\nForty-four percent of asymptomatic patients responded versus 7% of symptomatic patients. The median time to response was approximately 2 months and 1 month, respectively, for asymptomatic and symptomatic patients. The median duration of response was approximately 3 months and 1 month, respectively, for the asymptomatic and symptomatic patients. Baseline T4/T8 ratios were 0.46 for responders versus 0.33 for nonresponders.\nIn another study, INTRON A doses of 35 million IU were administered subcutaneously, daily (QD), for 12 weeks. Maintenance treatment, with every other day dosing (QOD), was continued for up to 1 year in patients achieving antitumor and antiviral responses. The median time to response was 2 months and the median duration of response was 5 months in the asymptomatic patients.\nIn the 30 million IU study group, 7% (5/72) of patients were complete responders and 22% (16/72) of the patients were partial responders. The 35 million IU study had 13% (3/23 patients) complete responders and 17% (4/23) partial responders.\nFor patients who received 30 million IU TIW, the median survival time was longer in patients with CD4 greater than 200 (30.7 months) than in patients with CD4 less than or equal to 200 (8.9 months). Among responders, the median survival time was 22.6 months versus 9.7 months in nonresponders.\n\n【10】 ## Chronic Hepatitis C\nThe safety and efficacy of INTRON A in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C was evaluated in 5 randomized clinical studies in which an INTRON A dose of 3 million IU three times a week (TIW) was assessed. The initial three studies were placebo-controlled trials that evaluated a 6-month (24-week) course of therapy. In each of the three studies, INTRON A therapy resulted in a reduction in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in a greater proportion of patients versus control patients at the end of 6 months of dosing. During the 6 months of follow-up, approximately 50% of the patients who responded maintained their ALT response. A combined analysis comparing pretreatment and post-treatment liver biopsies revealed histological improvement in a statistically significantly greater proportion of INTRON A-treated patients compared to controls.\nTwo additional studies have investigated longer treatment durations (up to 24 months).5,6 Patients in the two studies to evaluate longer duration of treatment had hepatitis with or without cirrhosis in the absence of decompensated liver disease. Complete response to treatment was defined as normalization of the final two serum ALT levels during the treatment period. A sustained response was defined as a complete response at the end of the treatment period, with sustained normal ALT values lasting at least 6 months following discontinuation of therapy.\nIn Study 1, all patients were initially treated with INTRON A 3 million IU TIW subcutaneously for 24 weeks (run-in-period). Patients who completed the initial 24-week treatment period were then randomly assigned to receive no further treatment, or to receive 3 million IU TIW for an additional 48 weeks. In Study 2, patients who met the entry criteria were randomly assigned to receive INTRON A 3 million IU TIW subcutaneously for 24 weeks or to receive INTRON A 3 million IU TIW subcutaneously for 96 weeks. In both studies, patient follow-up was variable and some data collection was retrospective.\nResults show that longer durations of INTRON A therapy improved the sustained response rate . In patients with complete responses (CR) to INTRON A therapy after 6 months of treatment (149/352 ), responses were less often sustained if drug was discontinued (21/70 ) than if it was continued for 18 to 24 months (44/79 ). Of all patients randomized, the sustained response rate in the patients receiving 18 or 24 months of therapy was 22% and 26%, respectively, in the two trials. In patients who did not have a CR by 6 months, additional therapy did not result in significantly more responses, since almost all patients who responded to therapy did so within the first 16 weeks of treatment.\nA subset (less than 50%) of patients from the combined extended dosing studies had liver biopsies performed both before and after INTRON A treatment. Improvement in necroinflammatory activity as assessed retrospectively by the Knodell (Study 1) and Scheuer (Study 2) Histology Activity Indices was observed in both studies. A higher number of patients (58%, 45/78) improved with extended therapy than with shorter (6 months) therapy (38%, 34/89) in this subset.\nCombination treatment with INTRON A and REBETOL (ribavirin USP) provided a significant reduction in virologic load and improved histologic response in adult patients with compensated liver disease who were treatment-naïve or had relapsed following therapy with alpha interferon alone; pediatric patients previously untreated with alpha interferon experienced a sustained virologic response\n\n【11】 ### Adults\nThe safety and efficacy of INTRON A in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B were evaluated in three clinical trials in which INTRON A doses of 30 to 35 million IU per week were administered subcutaneously (SC), as either 5 million IU daily (QD), or 10 million IU three times a week (TIW) for 16 weeks versus no treatment. All patients were 18 years of age or older with compensated liver disease, and had chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (serum HBsAg positive for at least 6 months) and HBV replication (serum HBeAg positive). Patients were also serum HBV-DNA positive, an additional indicator of HBV replication, as measured by a research assay.7,8 All patients had elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and liver biopsy findings compatible with the diagnosis of chronic hepatitis. Patients with the presence of antibody to human immunodeficiency virus (anti-HIV) or antibody to hepatitis delta virus (anti-HDV) in the serum were excluded from the studies.\nVirologic response to treatment was defined in these studies as a loss of serum markers of HBV replication (HBeAg and HBV DNA). Secondary parameters of response included loss of serum HBsAg, decreases in serum ALT, and improvement in liver histology.\nIn each of two randomized controlled studies, a significantly greater proportion of INTRON A-treated patients exhibited a virologic response compared with untreated control patients . In a third study without a concurrent control group, a similar response rate to INTRON A therapy was observed. Pretreatment with prednisone, evaluated in two of the studies, did not improve the response rate and provided no additional benefit.\nThe response to INTRON A therapy was durable. No patient responding to INTRON A therapy at a dose of 5 million IU QD or 10 million IU TIW relapsed during the follow-up period, which ranged from 2 to 6 months after treatment ended. The loss of serum HBeAg and HBV DNA was maintained in 100% of 19 responding patients followed for 3.5 to 36 months after the end of therapy.\nIn a proportion of responding patients, loss of HBeAg was followed by the loss of HBsAg. HBsAg was lost in 27% (4/15) of patients who responded to INTRON A therapy at a dose of 5 million IU QD, and 35% (8/23) of patients who responded to 10 million IU TIW. No untreated control patient lost HBsAg in these studies.\nIn an ongoing study to assess the long-term durability of virologic response, 64 patients responding to INTRON A therapy have been followed for 1.1 to 6.6 years after treatment; 95% (61/64) remain serum HBeAg negative, and 49% (30/61) lost serum HBsAg.\nINTRON A therapy resulted in normalization of serum ALT in a significantly greater proportion of treated patients compared to untreated patients in each of two controlled studies . In a third study without a concurrent control group, normalization of serum ALT was observed in 50% (12/24) of patients receiving INTRON A therapy.\nVirologic response was associated with a reduction in serum ALT to normal or near normal (less than or equal to 1.5 × the upper limit of normal) in 87% (13/15) of patients responding to INTRON A therapy at 5 million IU QD, and 100% (23/23) of patients responding to 10 million IU TIW.\nImprovement in liver histology was evaluated in Studies 1 and 3 by comparison of pretreatment and 6-month post-treatment liver biopsies using the semiquantitative Knodell Histology Activity Index.9 No statistically significant difference in liver histology was observed in treated patients compared to control patients in Study 1. Although statistically significant histological improvement from baseline was observed in treated patients in Study 3 (P≤0.01), there was no control group for comparison. Of those patients exhibiting a virologic response following treatment with 5 million IU QD or 10 million IU TIW, histological improvement was observed in 85% (17/20) compared to 36% (9/25) of patients who were not virologic responders. The histological improvement was due primarily to decreases in severity of necrosis, degeneration, and inflammation in the periportal, lobular, and portal regions of the liver (Knodell Categories I + II + III). Continued histological improvement was observed in four responding patients who lost serum HBsAg and were followed 2 to 4 years after the end of INTRON A therapy.10\n\n【12】 ### Pediatrics\nThe safety and efficacy of INTRON A in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B was evaluated in one randomized controlled trial of 149 patients ranging from 1 year to 17 years of age. Seventy-two patients were treated with 3 million IU/m2 of INTRON A therapy administered subcutaneously three times a week (TIW) for 1 week; the dose was then escalated to 6 million IU/m2 TIW for a minimum of 16 weeks up to 24 weeks. The maximum weekly dosage was 10 million IU TIW. Seventy-seven patients were untreated controls. Study entry and response criteria were identical to those described in the adult patient population.\nPatients treated with INTRON A therapy had a better response (loss of HBV DNA and HBeAg at 24 weeks of follow-up) compared to the untreated controls (24%  versus 10%  P=0.05). Sixteen of the 17 responders treated with INTRON A therapy remained HBV DNA and HBeAg negative and had a normal serum ALT 12 to 24 months after completion of treatment. Serum HBsAg became negative in 7 out of 17 patients who responded to INTRON A therapy. None of the control patients who had an HBV DNA and HBeAg response became HBsAg negative. At 24 weeks of follow-up, normalization of serum ALT was similar in patients treated with INTRON A therapy (17%, 12/72) and in untreated control patients (16%, 12/77). Patients with a baseline HBV DNA less than 100 pg/mL were more likely to respond to INTRON A therapy than were patients with a baseline HBV DNA greater than 100 pg/mL (35% versus 9%, respectively). Patients who contracted hepatitis B through maternal vertical transmission had lower response rates than those who contracted the disease by other means (5% versus 31%, respectively). There was no evidence that the effects on HBV DNA and HBeAg were limited to specific subpopulations based on age, gender, or race.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Erslan, Hamernik and Hardy, in 1964 and 1966, were the first to perform an animal auto-transplantation of the uterus and subsequently deliver a pregnancy for that uterus , a human uterine transplant was performed in Saudi Arabia by Dr. Wafa Fagee. Post-operatively, the patient had two spontaneous menstrual cycles, followed by amenorrhea; exploratory laparotomy confirmed uterine necrosis. The procedure has raised some moral and ethical concerns.\n\n【2】 #Research\nMuch of the animal research that has been investigated in the past have explored the feasibility of uterine auto transplantation and have neglected the role of uterine allo-transplantation as well as the influence of immunosuppressive therapy on fertility. Infertility and surrogacy, which also has been considered another alternative for infertility, have been subjected to legal, moral, ethical and religious restrains. This has then led for us as physicians to investigate cautiously the indications for human uterine transplants. The prime candidates for human uterine transplants are:\n- those with a congenital absence the uterus (e.g. Mayer Rokitansky Kuster Hauser Syndrome), - those who have lost their uterus for benign causes (e.g. pelvic inflammatory disease, fibroid uterus, pelvic tuberculosis) or early invasive cervical or ovarian malignancies at an early age.\n\n【3】 #Ethical and religious issues\nDue to the uterus' debatable status as a non-vital organ, debate over the ethicality of uterine transplants persists. Some groups consider the uterus a vital organ due to its ability to sustain the life of the fetus, and concerns exist that the successful transplantation of a uterus might give rise to birth defects should the recipient ever attempt to bear children.\nThere is also religious debate surrounding the morality of uterine transplants, with a myriad of views which vary based on religion and personal preference.\n\n【4】 #Successful transplants\nIn Saudi Arabia in 2000, a uterine transplant was performed on a patient whose own uterus had hemorrhaged after childbirth. The transplanted uterus functioned for 99 days, however it ultimately needed to be removed after its failure due to blood clotting. Within the medical community there is some debate as to whether or not the transplant can truly be considered successful, however due to the operation's duration, general consensus favors success.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Therefore, this procedure may be used provided that normal arrangements are in place for clinical governance, consent and audit.\nAs part of the consent process, patients should be informed that there is a range of treatment options available to them and also that further procedures may be needed.\nThis replaces previous guidance on percutaneous disc decompression using coblation for lower back pain (NICE interventional procedure guidance 173)\n\n【2】 #Indications and current treatments\nLumbar disc herniation occurs when the nucleus pulposus of an intervertebral disc protrudes through a tear in the surrounding annulus fibrosus. Symptoms include pain in the back, pain in the leg (sciatica), and numbness or weakness in the leg. Serious neurological sequelae may sometimes occur.\nConservative treatments include analgesics, non‑steroidal anti‑inflammatory medication, manual therapy and acupuncture. Epidural corticosteroid injections can also be used to reduce nerve pain in the short term. Lumbar discectomy is considered if there is evidence of severe nerve compression or persistent symptoms that are unresponsive to conservative treatment. Surgical techniques include open discectomy or less invasive alternatives using percutaneous approaches.\nPercutaneous coblation of the intervertebral disc for low back pain may be used for patients with pain caused by contained herniated discs that have not responded to conservative treatment, when open surgery is not suitable\n\n【3】 #The procedure\nPercutaneous coblation of the intervertebral disc is usually done with the patient under sedation and using local anaesthesia. Using fluoroscopic guidance, an introducer needle is inserted into the affected disc. A small radiofrequency probe is then inserted through the needle and into the disc. The probe delivers radiofrequency energy to create a plasma field at its tip, which causes ablation of the tissue at temperatures of 40–70°C. When it has reached a pre‑determined depth the probe is removed, coagulating the tissue as it is withdrawn. Around 6 channels are created during the procedure, the number of channels depending on the amount of tissue reduction needed. The aim is to remove tissue from the disc nucleus without damaging surrounding structures\n\n【4】 #Efficacy\n\n【5】 A systematic review of 27 studies, including 3211 patients treated by percutaneous coblation, reported that pain measured on a visual analogue scale (VAS; range 0–10, where 0 is no pain and 10 is the greatest imaginable pain) decreased after percutaneous coblation from 7.27 (n=971) at baseline to 2.84 at 3 months (n=612, p<0.001), 3.03 at 12 months (n=702, p<0.001), and 3.69 at 24 months (n=92, p<0.001). In patients treated by conservative therapy (in the comparator groups of the studies), the mean pain score decreased from 6.98 at baseline (n=98) to 3.85 at 12‑month follow‑up (n=57, p=0.073 compared with percutaneous coblation). A non‑randomised comparative study of 160 patients treated by percutaneous coblation or open discectomy reported that the VAS score for pain reduced from 7.9 and 8.0 at baseline to 2.2 and 1.8, respectively, at 12 month follow‑up (p values not reported).\nThe systematic review of 27 studies reported that functional mobility measured using the Oswestry Disability Index improved after percutaneous coblation from 58.95 (n=318) at baseline to 18.30 at 3 months (n=153, p<0.001), 24.43 at 12 months (n=264, p<0.001) and 36.98 at 24 months (n=92, p<0.005). In the group of patients treated by conservative therapy, the Oswestry Disability Index worsened from 43 at baseline (n=40) to 49 at 12‑month follow‑up (n=28, p<0.001 compared with percutaneous coblation). The non‑randomised comparative study of 160 patients treated by percutaneous coblation or open discectomy reported improvements in disability of 60% and 78%, respectively, at 12‑month follow‑up (p value not reported). The RCT of 118 patients treated by percutaneous coblation alone, percutaneous coblation combined with nerve root steroid injection, or epidural steroid injection reported that the mean Oswestry Disability Index scores decreased from 47.73, 47.71 and 48.10 at baseline to 22.73, 22.85 and 27.76, respectively, at 12 month follow‑up (p<0.001 for all 3 compared with baseline; p<0.001 for percutaneous coblation compared against epidural injection).\nAn RCT of 90 patients treated by percutaneous coblation or epidural steroid injection, which was included in the systematic review of 27 studies, reported that both treatments were associated with significant improvements in quality of life measured using the SF‑36 questionnaire: there were significant improvements in components of physical function, bodily pain, the physical components summary, and social function at 6 months. The percutaneous coblation group also had significant improvement for physical and emotional role functioning. There were significant differences between treatment groups in favour of percutaneous coblation for physical function (p=0.0016), bodily pain (p=0.0039), the physical components summary (p=0.004) and social function (p=0.0312).\nThe RCT of 90 patients reported that 62% of patients treated by percutaneous coblation were extremely or very satisfied at 6‑month follow‑up compared with 33% of patients treated by epidural steroid injection (absolute numbers and p value not reported). The non‑randomised comparative study of 160 patients reported that 67% of patients would recommend percutaneous coblation to other patients, and 32% of patients would not recommend it.\nA case series of 1390 patients, which was included in the systematic review of 27 studies, reported that disc bulging  was eliminated in 34% of patients, significantly reduced in 48% and unchanged in 18% of patients at 6‑month follow‑up. An RCT of 64 patients treated by percutaneous coblation or conservative therapy reported a decrease in the mean disc bulge from 5.1 mm at baseline to 1.8 mm at 3‑month follow‑up (p<0.001) in the percutaneous coblation group.\nThe specialist advisers listed the key efficacy outcomes as reduction of back and leg pain, disability, and work and domestic productivity\n\n【6】 #Safety\nIncreased radicular pain was reported in 2% (1/45) of patients treated by percutaneous coblation and 13% (5/40) of patients treated by epidural steroid injection in a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of 90 patients; increased back pain was reported in 2% (1/45) and 10% (4/40) of patients respectively. Acute low back pain with spasms was reported in 1 patient in each group in the same study. Lateralised postural lumbar pain and hypertone (contraction of paravertebral muscles), which lasted up to 10 days after the procedure, were reported in 5% of patients in a case series of 1390 patients (actual numbers not reported). Worsening of pain was reported in 1 patient in a case series of 396 patients.\nMuscle tightness or spasms were reported in 4% (2/45) of patients treated by percutaneous coblation and 3% (1/40) of patients treated by epidural steroid injection in the RCT of 90 patients.\nBradycardia, reported by the authors as being related to poor tolerance to minor pain, was reported in 1% (4/396) of patients in the case series of 396 patients.\nDiscitis was reported in 1 patient in the case series of 396 patients (no further information given).\nRadicular paraesthesia was reported in less than 1% (2/396) of patients in the case series of 396 patients.\nIncreased weakness was reported in 2% (1/45) of patients treated by percutaneous coblation and 0% (0/40) of patients treated by epidural steroid injection in the randomised controlled trial of 90 patients.\nEpidural fibrosis, diagnosed by MRI 3 months after percutaneous coblation, was reported in a single case report. The patient had recurrence of pain in the left lower extremity and lower back, which spontaneously resolved after the MRI. No further treatment was needed.\nIn addition to safety outcomes reported in the literature, specialist advisers are asked about anecdotal adverse events (events which they have heard about) and about theoretical adverse events (events which they think might possibly occur, even if they have never done so). For this procedure, specialist advisers listed visceral injury and vascular injury as anecdotal adverse events. They considered that the following were theoretical adverse events: nerve injury, needle misplacement through the disc to the retroperitoneum or behind the dura or spinal canal, instability, paralysis, bleeding, and possibly late disc protrusion (rare).\n\n【7】 #Information for patients\nNICE has produced information on this procedure for patients and carers (information for the public).

However, the elements comprising Virchow's triad were neither proposed by Virchow, nor did he ever suggest a triad to describe the pathogenesis of venous thrombosis. In fact, it was decades following Virchow's death before a consensus was reached proposing that thrombosis is the result of alterations in blood flow, vascular endothelial injury, or alterations in the constitution of the blood. Still, the modern understanding of the factors leading to embolism are similar to the description provided by Virchow. Its nebulous origins notwithstanding, Virchow's triad remains a useful concept for clinicians and pathologists alike in understanding the contributors to thrombosis.\n\n【2】 #The triad\nThe triad consists of three components:\n\n【3】 #Historical Perspective\nThe origin of the term \"Virchow's Triad\" is of historical interest, and has been subject to reinterpretation in recent years. While both Virchow's and the modern triads describe thrombosis, the previous triad has been characterized as \"the consequences of thrombosis\", and the modern triad as \"the causes of thrombosis\".\nRudolf Virchow elucidated the etiology of pulmonary embolism, whereby thrombi occurring within the veins, particularly those of the extremities, become dislodged and migrate to the pulmonary vasculature  While these factors had already been previously established in the medical literature by others, for unclear reasons they ultimately became known as Virchow's triad.  This eponym did not emerge in the literature until long after Virchow's death. One estimate of the first use of the phrase dates it to the early 1950s.\nAlthough the concept of the triad is usually attributed to Virchow, he did not include endothelial injury in his description. This has been attributed to a dispute Virchow had with Jean Cruveilhier, who considered local trauma of primary importance in the development of pulmonary artery thrombosis.\n\n【4】 #Pathophysiology\nThis video explains the process of thrombosis:", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "df6fd708-0153-49e8-9a28-6452c38ead94", "title": null, "text": "【0】 Nevirapine clinical pharmacology\n\n【1】 ### Adults\nThe single-dose pharmacokinetics of VIRAMUNE XR was studied in 17 healthy volunteers. Nevirapine was absorbed with a median tmax of approximately 24 hrs. The mean Cmax and AUC0-∞ of nevirapine were 2060 ng per mL and 161,000 ng*hr/mL, respectively. The bioavailability of 400 mg of VIRAMUNE XR, relative to 400 mg of immediate-release VIRAMUNE, was approximately 75%.\nThe multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of VIRAMUNE XR was studied in 24 HIV-1 infected subjects who switched from chronic VIRAMUNE IR to VIRAMUNE XR. The mean nevirapine AUC0-24,ss and Cmin,ss after 19 days of VIRAMUNE XR dosing under fasted conditions were 82,000 ng*hr/mL and 2920 ng per mL, respectively. When VIRAMUNE XR was administered under fed conditions, the mean nevirapine AUC0-24,ss and Cmin,ss were 96,700 ng*hr/mL and 3150 ng per mL, respectively. The bioavailability of 400 mg of VIRAMUNE XR, relative to 400 mg of immediate-release VIRAMUNE, under fasted and fed conditions, was 80% and 94%, respectively. The difference in the bioavailability of nevirapine, when VIRAMUNE XR is dosed under fasted or fed conditions, is not considered clinically relevant. VIRAMUNE XR can be taken with or without food.\nIn single-dose, parallel-group bioavailability trial (1100.1517) in adults, the VIRAMUNE XR 100 mg tablet exhibited extended-release characteristics of prolonged absorption and lower maximal concentration, as compared to the immediate-release VIRAMUNE 200 mg tablet.\nNevirapine is highly lipophilic and is essentially nonionized at physiologic pH. Following intravenous administration to healthy adults, the apparent volume of distribution (Vdss) of nevirapine was 1.21 ± 0.09 L/kg, suggesting that nevirapine is widely distributed in humans. Nevirapine readily crosses the placenta and is also found in breast milk . Nevirapine is about 60% bound to plasma proteins in the plasma concentration range of 1-10 mcg per mL. Nevirapine concentrations in human cerebrospinal fluid (n=6) were 45% (±5%) of the concentrations in plasma; this ratio is approximately equal to the fraction not bound to plasma protein.\nIn vivo studies in humans and in vitro studies with human liver microsomes have shown that nevirapine is extensively biotransformed via cytochrome P450 (oxidative) metabolism to several hydroxylated metabolites. In vitro studies with human liver microsomes suggest that oxidative metabolism of nevirapine is mediated primarily by cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozymes from the CYP3A and CYP2B6 families, although other isozymes may have a secondary role. In a mass balance/excretion trial in eight healthy male volunteers dosed to steady state with immediate-release VIRAMUNE 200 mg given twice daily followed by a single 50 mg dose of 14C-nevirapine, approximately 91.4 ± 10.5% of the radiolabeled dose was recovered, with urine (81.3 ± 11.1%) representing the primary route of excretion compared to feces (10.1 ± 1.5%). Greater than 80% of the radioactivity in urine was made up of glucuronide conjugates of hydroxylated metabolites. Thus cytochrome P450 metabolism, glucuronide conjugation, and urinary excretion of glucuronidated metabolites represent the primary route of nevirapine biotransformation and elimination in humans. Only a small fraction (less than 5%) of the radioactivity in urine (representing less than 3% of the total dose) was made up of parent compound; therefore, renal excretion plays a minor role in elimination of the parent compound.\n\n【2】 ### Specific Populations\nHIV-1 seronegative adults with mild (CrCL 50-79 mL per min; n=7), moderate (CrCL 30-49 mL per min; n=6), or severe (CrCL less than 30 mL per min; n=4) renal impairment received a single 200 mg dose of immediate-release VIRAMUNE in a pharmacokinetic trial. These subjects did not require dialysis. The trial included six additional subjects with renal failure requiring dialysis.\nIn subjects with renal impairment (mild, moderate or severe), there were no significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of nevirapine. However, subjects requiring dialysis exhibited a 44% reduction in nevirapine AUC over a one-week exposure period. There was also evidence of accumulation of nevirapine hydroxy-metabolites in plasma in subjects requiring dialysis. An additional 200 mg dose of immediate-release VIRAMUNE following each dialysis treatment is indicated . VIRAMUNE XR has not been studied in patients with renal dysfunction.\nIn a steady-state trial comparing 46 subjects with mild (n=17; expansion of some portal areas; Ishak Score 1-2), moderate (n=20; expansion of most portal areas with occasional portal-to-portal and portal-to-central bridging; Ishak Score 3-4), or severe (n=9; marked bridging with occasional cirrhosis without decompensation indicating Child-Pugh A; Ishak Score 5-6) fibrosis as a measure of hepatic impairment, the multiple dose pharmacokinetic disposition of nevirapine and its five oxidative metabolites were not altered. However, approximately 15% of these subjects with hepatic fibrosis had nevirapine trough concentrations above 9,000 mcg per mL (2-fold the usual mean trough). Therefore, patients with hepatic impairment should be monitored carefully for evidence of drug-induced toxicity . The subjects studied were receiving antiretroviral therapy containing immediate-release VIRAMUNE 200 mg twice daily for at least 6 weeks prior to pharmacokinetic sampling, with a median duration of therapy of 3.4 years.\nDo not administer nevirapine to patients with moderate or severe (Child-Pugh Class B or C, respectively) hepatic impairment . VIRAMUNE XR has not been evaluated in patients with hepatic impairment.\nThe effects of gender on the pharmacokinetics of VIRAMUNE XR have been investigated in Trial 1100.1486. Female subjects tend to have higher (approximately 20 - 30%) trough concentrations in both VIRAMUNE XR and immediate-release VIRAMUNE treatment groups.\nAn evaluation of nevirapine plasma concentrations (pooled data from several clinical trials) from HIV-1-infected subjects (27 Black, 24 Hispanic, 189 Caucasian) revealed no marked difference in nevirapine steady-state trough concentrations (median Cminss = 4.7 mcg per mL Black, 3.8 mcg per mL Hispanic, 4.3 mcg per mL Caucasian) with long-term treatment with immediate-release VIRAMUNE at 400 mg per day. However, the pharmacokinetics of nevirapine have not been evaluated specifically for the effects of ethnicity.\nBlack subjects (n=80/group) in Trial 1100.1486 showed approximately 30 to 35% higher trough concentrations than Caucasian subjects (250-325 subjects/group) in both immediate-release VIRAMUNE and VIRAMUNE XR treatment groups over 96 weeks of treatment at 400 mg per day.\nNevirapine pharmacokinetics in HIV-1-infected adults do not appear to change with age (range 18–68 years); however, nevirapine has not been extensively evaluated in patients beyond the age of 65 years .\nThe pharmacokinetics of VIRAMUNE XR were assessed in HIV-1 infected children 3 to less than 18 years of age. Children enrolled received weight or body surface area dose-adjusted immediate-release VIRAMUNE in combination with other antiretrovirals for a minimum of 18 weeks and then were switched to VIRAMUNE XR tablets in combination with other antiretrovirals for 10 days, after which steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters were determined.\nOverall, the mean systemic nevirapine exposures in children 6 to less than 18 years of age following administration of VIRAMUNE XR and immediate-release VIRAMUNE were similar. Based on intensive PK data (N=17), the observed geometric mean ratios of VIRAMUNE XR to immediate-release VIRAMUNE were approximately 97% for Cmin,ss and 94% for AUCsswith 90% confidence intervals within 80% - 125%; the ratio for Cmax,ss was lower and consistent with a once daily extended-release dosage form.\nTrial 1100.1518 did not provide sufficient pharmacokinetic data for children 3 to less than 6 years of age to support the use of VIRAMUNE XR in this age group.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

{"seq_id": "d7edffaf-a401-4532-ad58-c12446d07899", "title": null, "text": "【0】 Macrobiotic diet\nMacrobiotics, from the Greek \"macro\" (large, long) and \"bios\" (life), is a dietary regimen that involves eating grains as a staple food supplemented with other local foodstuffs such as vegetables and beans. Although in macrobiotics people may opt to use Japanese ingredients (Japan being the cradle of contemporary Macrobiotics), according to the general guidelines people should use the ingredients that are found locally (e.g. mustard instead of ginger), and avoid the use of sugar and other highly processed or refined foods. Macrobiotics also addresses the manner of eating by recommending against overeating and requiring that food be chewed thoroughly before swallowing.\n\n【1】 #History\nThe earliest recorded use of the term macrobiotics is found in the writing of Hippocrates, the father of Western Medicine. In his essay 'Airs, Waters, and Places,' Hippocrates introduced the word to describe people who were healthy and long-lived. Herodotus, Aristotle, Galen, and other classical writers used the term macrobiotics to describe a lifestyle, including a simple balanced diet, that promoted health and longevity.\nMacrobiotic methodology was utilized by many of the long-lived traditional cultures, such as the Incas, the Chinese in the Han Dynasty, etc. George Ohsawa drew from Oriental and Japanese folk medicine to create his version of this traditional philosophy of health.\nGeorge Ohsawa brought his teaching to Europe from Japan. Ohsawa was a Japanese philosopher, who was inspired to formalize macrobiotics by the teachings of Kaibara Ekiken, Andou Shōeki, Mizuno Nanbaku, and Sagen Ishizuka and his disciples Nishibata Manabu and Shojiro Goto.\nOhsawa  brought his macrobiotic teachings to North America in the late 1950s. Macrobiotic education was spread in the United States by his students Herman Aihara, Cornelia Aihara, Michio Kushi and Aveline Kushi, and their students. Michio Kushi has been the most prominent of these teachers.\n\"Whole foods, such as brown rice, are central to a macrobiotic diet, and many of the first customers and owners of the alternative food stores were students of macrobiotics. In the 20th century, a few creative and brilliant teachers, such as the Kushis (who immigrated to the United States from Japan after World War II), emerged who distilled the wide-ranging ideas and interpreted them for modern, urban, and industrialized life.\"\n\n【2】 #Philosophy\nFollowers of the macrobiotic approach believe that food and food quality powerfully affects health, well being, and happiness. The macrobiotic approach suggests choosing food that is less processed and more natural, and employing more traditional methods of cooking for family, friends, and oneself.\nOne goal of the macrobiotic philosophy and practice is to become sensitive to the true effects of foods on health and well being. In this way, one goes beyond rules and regulations concerning diet to choosing foods that sustains one's health. In this way, dietary guidelines help one to develop sensitivity and an intuitive sense for what sustains one's health and well-being in diet as well as relationships and activities.\nMacrobiotics emphasizes locally grown whole grain cereals, pulses (legumes), vegetables, seaweed, fermented soy products and fruit, combined into meals according to the principle of balance (known as yin and yang).\nDietary recommendations include whole grains, such as brown rice, and other whole grain products, such as buckwheat pasta (soba); a variety of cooked and raw vegetables; beans and bean products, such as tofu, tempeh and miso; sea vegetables; mild natural seasonings; fish; nuts and seeds; mild (non-stimulating) beverages, such as bancha twig tea; and fruit.\nCertain types of vegetable-fruits, such as tomatoes, peppers and eggplant, are not recommended and are either avoided altogether or used very sparingly.\n\n【3】 #Composition\nMacrobiotics is an approach to life rather than a diet.\nGeneral Guidelines for the diet are:\n- Whole grains, especially brown rice: 30-50%\n- Vegetables: 25-50%\n- Beans and Bean Products: 10-20 %\n- Miso soup: daily\n- Seaweed: small amounts daily\nThe remainder is composed of fish and seafood, seeds and nuts, seed and nut butters, seasonings, sweeteners, fruits, and beverages. Other naturally raised animal products may be included if needed during dietary transition or according to individual needs.\n\n【4】 #Other factors\nThe composition of dishes and the choices of foods is adjusted according to\n- The Season\n- Activity\n- Sex\n- Age\n- Health Condition\n- Transition in One's Diet and any other personal considerations\n\n【5】 #Food preparation techniques\nFood is prepared in various ways.  The preferred manner of cutting vegetables for the real enthusiast is complicated:  onions (round and in layers) are cut differently than carrots, which are cut differently from chard, for example.  Good macrobiotic cookbooks will instruct in this art.  Foods are occasionally served uncooked, as raw food, but mostly are cooked in a variety of ways, including:\nSteaming, boiling, ohitashi/blanching, nishime/long steaming, nitsuke/saute and boiling, kinpira/sauteeing and boiling, sukiyaki/stew, nabe, oven baking, baking in a pressure cooker, tempura, and frying.\n\n【6】 #Cooking according to the time of the year\nIn spring:\n- food with a lighter quality\n- wild plants, germs, lightly fermented food, grain species, fresh greens\n- light cooking style: steaming, cooking for a short time, etc.\n- large-leaved greens, sweet corn, fruit, summer pumpkins\n- More raw foods\n- lighter grains such as barley, bulghur, cous cous, and corn\nIn autumn:\n- root vegetables, (winter) pumpkins, beans, cereals, etc.\n- heavier grains such as sweet rice, mochi and millet\n- more miso, shoyu, oil, and salt\n\n【7】 #Switching to a macrobiotic diet\nA person considering adopting the Macrobiotic diet should spend some time researching the philosophy as well as the specific foods and cooking techniques used.  It is very likely that if a macrobiotic way of eating is adopted \"cold turkey\" that one will have vast cravings for a few days to a few weeks.  However, one may choose to transition into a full macrobiotic way of eating and being.\nThe best way to transition to a macrobiotic diet, however, is to first employ a wholefoods diet for several months before going into the more restrictive macrobiotic way of eating and being.  A wholefoods diet requires erradicating all heavily processed and refined foods such as granulated sugar, refined flour, and most canned or pre-prepared foods.  Next, one would begin erradicating all dairy products and red meat, while utilizing only whole grains.  Finally, particularly during these transition periods, it is important to be very aware of what is going on in your body and your body's response to the foods you intake.\nAlso, it is recommended that one researches the diet and either consults a macrobiotic counselor or makes a gradual transition to the macrobiotic way of eating. A well-trained macrobiotic counselor will orient the person not only toward the correct foods and methods of eating, but will also guide the person to a more aware state of being.\n\n【8】 #Amount of Yin and Yang in the products\nMacrobiotic eating follows the principle of balance (called yin and yang in China). Products that are extreme are not suggested for regular use. No foods are forbidden, but better quality natural foods are always suggested.\nFoods that are overstimulating can exhaust the body and mind. These are classified as extreme yin (stimulating) in their effects:\n- Sugar\n- Alcohol\n- Honey\n- Coffee\n- Chocolate\n- Refined flour products\n- Very hot spices\n- Chemicals and preservatives\n- Commercial milk, yogurt and soft cheeses\n- Poor quality vegetable oils\n- Poultry\n- Meat\n- Eggs\nFoods such as these are used in a macrobiotic way of eating.\n\n【9】 #Macrobiotics vs. normal Japanese cooking\nThe macrobiotic way of eating is erroneously thought to be Japanese. A majority of the world population in the past ate a primarily plant based grain and vegetable based diet. Because many of the recently popular teachers came from Japan, foods from Japan that are beneficial for health are incorporated by most modern macrobiotic eaters. Some macrobiotic ingredients are also standard ingredients in Japanese cuisine.\n\n【10】 #Macrobiotics vs. vegetarianism\nThe macrobiotic way of eating shares many of the same foods as vegan eating although animal foods, most often as fish, are suggested. The two diet styles share enough similarities that a vegan version of macrobiotics is not uncommon.\nThe Macrobiotic approach to diet is based on traditional ways of eating. While there are as yet no totally vegan cultures that are long-lived, the longest-lived cultures around the world consume between 70% and 99% whole plant foods. John Robbins, a well-known vegan advocate, pointed this out in his recent book, Healthy at 100. The American Dietetic Association approves of carefully-planned vegan diets. In the words of the Association, Well-planned vegan and other types of vegetarian diets are appropriate for all stages of the life cycle, including during pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, It is the position of the American Dietetic Association and Dietitians of Canada that appropriately planned vegetarian diets are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases.\n\n【11】 #Examples of macrobiotic dishes\n- Vegetarian Sushi with Carrots and Scallions\n- Fried Mochi with a ginger soy sauce dipping sauce\n- Miso soup with Daikon Radish and Onions\n- Quinoa Salad\n- Fried Rice with Tempeh and Vegetables\n- Broiled Red Snapper with Red Pepper and Corn\n- Whole Wheat Pasta with Season's Savory Vegetable Sauce\n- Blanched Green Vegetables with Pumpkin Seed Dressing\n- Apple Blueberry Kanten ( vegetarian jello)\n- Amasake Pudding with Vanilla and Lemon\n- Millet with Winter Squash and Sesame Salt\n- Fried Tofu with Mustard\n- Mushroom and Barley Soup\n- Split Pea Soup with Seitan\n\n【12】 #Notable Macrobiotics\nDirk Benedict; Rudolf Hess, deputy leader of the Nazi party; John Lennon; Yoko Ono; Gwyneth Paltrow; Sting; Avril Lavigne; Madonna; Warren Cuccurullo (Duran Duran, Missing Persons); Iggy Pop (not at present); Bob Weir (Grateful Dead Guitarist); Kyle D. Hlubek (string theory guitarist); Gloria Swanson; William Dufty; Courtney Love.\n\n【13】 #Criticisms\nMacrobiotics has long been touted as a preventative and a cure for cancer. Despite these claims, many long term practitioners of the diet have themselves developed cancer and subsequently died from it. Michio Kushi's wife Aveline and daughter Lilly both succumbed to the illness, as did Cecile Levin. Michio Kushi also developed cancer and resorted to surgery to aid in his recovery. In principle Macrobiotics offers significant benefits to good health, but one must always approach any philosophy with a questioning mind.\nCritics opposed to macrobiotic diets in children claim that the diet (and similar vegetarian diets) are lacking in essential nutrients for proper growth and development.  This argument is valid if the diet is poorly planned and if the caregivers do not have enough information regarding the diet.\nThe following nutrients should be especially monitored in children due to their importance in facilitating growth and function:  calcium, protein, iron, zinc, vitamin D, vitamin B12, riboflavin, vitamin A, omega-3 fatty acids and energy.\nMany children following the Standard American Diet (S.A.D.) are deficient in these above nutrients.  All are available in properly planned macrobiotic diets.\nVitamin D is available through adequate exposure to the sun. Calcium is available from hard leafy greens, nuts and seeds. Zinc is available from nuts and seeds. B12 is in fish and in thempeh. Vitamin A in the form of beta-carotene is abundant in macrobiotic diets. Adequate protein is available from grains, nuts, seeds, beans, and bean products. Omega-3 fatty acids are in soy products, walnuts, pumpkin seeds, flax seeds and fatty fish. Riboflavin along with most other B vitamins are abundant in whole grains. Iron is in the form of non-heme iron in beans, sea vegetables and leafy greens.\n\n【14】 #The New Macrobiotics\nThere is a new breed of macrobiotic teachers who are revising the practice of a macrobiotic way of eating. These teachers are incorporating traditional macrobiotic (longevity) health wisdom from the east and west and marrying it with the latest findings of modern nutrition and science. These teachers, also, emphasize the importance of a healthy lifestyle practices such as exercise and adequate sleep.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Adjust the dose based on the patient’s INR and the condition being treated. Consult the latest evidence-based clinical practice guidelines from the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) to assist in the determination of the duration and intensity of anticoagulation with Coumadin.\n- An INR of greater than 4.0 appears to provide no additional therapeutic benefit in most patients and is associated with a higher risk of bleeding.\n- Dosing Information\n- For patients with a DVT or PE secondary to a transient (reversible) risk factor, treatment with warfarin for 3 months is recommended.\n- For patients with two episodes of unprovoked DVT or PE, long-term treatment with warfarin is recommended. For a patient receiving long-term anticoagulant treatment, periodically reassess the risk-benefit ratio of continuing such treatment in the individual patient.\n- In patients with non-valvular AF, anticoagulate with warfarin to target INR of 2.5 (range, 2.0-3.0).\n- In patients with non-valvular AF that is persistent or paroxysmal and at high risk of stroke (i.e. having any of the following features: prior ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack, or systemic embolism, or 2 of the following risk factors: age greater than 75 years, moderately or severely impaired left ventricular systolic function and/or heart failure, history of hypertension, or diabetes mellitus), long-term anticoagulation with warfarin is recommended.\n- Oral anticoagulation therapy with warfarin has not been fully evaluated by clinical trials in patients with valvular disease associated with AF, patients with mitral stenosis, and patients with recurrent systemic embolism of unknown etiology. However, a moderate dose regimen (INR 2.0-3.0) may be used for these patients.\n\n【3】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\n- Developed by: American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP)\n- Class of Recommendation: Class IIa - Strength of Evidence: Category B\n- Dosing Information\n- In patients with antiphospholipid syndrome with previous arterial or VTE, vitamin K antagonists, such as warfarin, should be titrated to a moderate-intensity INR range (INR 2 to 3), rather than higher intensity (INR 3 to 4.5).\n\n【4】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n- Dosing Information\n- Warfarin, dosed at an average of 4.1 mg daily to achieve a goal INR of 1.5, with or without aspirin significantly reduced overall ischemic heart disease events in a primary prevention study.\n\n【5】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Pediatric)\n- Adequate and well-controlled studies with Coumadin have not been conducted in any pediatric population, and the optimum dosing, safety, and efficacy in pediatric patients is unknown.\n\n【6】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Warfarin (oral) in pediatric patients.\n\n【7】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Warfarin (oral) in pediatric patients.\n\n【8】 #Contraindications\n- Pregnancy\n- Coumadin is contraindicated in women who are pregnant except in pregnant women with mechanical heart valves, who are at high risk of thromboembolism. Coumadin can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Coumadin exposure during pregnancy causes a recognized pattern of major congenital malformations (warfarin embryopathy and fetotoxicity), fatal fetal hemorrhage, and an increased risk of spontaneous abortion and fetal mortality. If Coumadin is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus.\n- Hemorrhagic tendencies or blood dyscrasias\n- Recent or contemplated surgery of the central nervous system or eye, or traumatic surgery resulting in large open surfaces.\n- Bleeding tendencies associated with:\n- Active ulceration or overt bleeding of the gastrointestinal, genitourinary, or respiratory tract\n- Central nervous system hemorrhage\n- Cerebral aneurysms, dissecting aorta - Pericarditis and pericardial effusions\n- Bacterial endocarditis - Threatened abortion, eclampsia, and preeclampsia - Unsupervised patients with conditions associated with potential high level of non-compliance\n- Spinal puncture and other diagnostic or therapeutic procedures with potential for uncontrollable bleeding\n- Hypersensitivity to warfarin or to any other components of this product (e.g. anaphylaxis)\n- Major regional or lumbar block anesthesia - Malignant hypertension\n\n【9】 - Hemorrhage\n- Coumadin can cause major or fatal bleeding. Bleeding is more likely to occur within the first month. Risk factors for bleeding include high intensity of anticoagulation (INR >4.0), age greater than or equal to 65, history of highly variable INRs, history of gastrointestinal bleeding, hypertension, cerebrovascular disease, anemia, malignancy, trauma, renal impairment, certain genetic factors, certain concomitant drugs, and long duration of warfarin therapy.\n- Perform regular monitoring of INR in all treated patients. Those at high risk of bleeding may benefit from more frequent INR monitoring, careful dose adjustment to desired INR, and a shortest duration of therapy appropriate for the clinical condition. However, maintenance of INR in the therapeutic range does not eliminate the risk of bleeding.\n- Drugs, dietary changes, and other factors affect INR levels achieved with Coumadin therapy. Perform more frequent INR monitoring when starting or stopping other drugs, including botanicals, or when changing dosages of other drugs.\n- Instruct patients about prevention measures to minimize risk of bleeding and to report signs and symptoms of bleeding.\n- Tissue Necrosis - Systemic Atheroemboli and Cholesterol Microemboli\n- Anticoagulation therapy with Coumadin may enhance the release of atheromatous plaque emboli. Systemic atheroemboli and cholesterol microemboli can present with a variety of signs and symptoms depending on the site of embolization. The most commonly involved visceral organs are the kidneys followed by the pancreas, spleen, and liver. Some cases have progressed to necrosis or death. A distinct syndrome resulting from microemboli to the feet is known as “purple toes syndrome.” Discontinue Coumadin therapy if such phenomena are observed. Consider alternative drugs if continued anticoagulation therapy is necessary.\n- Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia - Do not use Coumadin as initial therapy in patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis syndrome (HITTS). Cases of limb ischemia, necrosis, and gangrene have occurred in patients with HIT and HITTS when heparin treatment was discontinued and warfarin therapy was started or continued. In some patients, sequelae have included amputation of the involved area and/or death. Treatment with Coumadin may be considered after the platelet count has normalized.\n- Use in Pregnant Women with Mechanical Heart Valves\n- Coumadin can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. While Coumadin is contraindicated during pregnancy, the potential benefits of using Coumadin may outweigh the risks for pregnant women with mechanical heart valves at high risk of thromboembolism. In those individual situations, the decision to initiate or continue Coumadin should be reviewed with the patient, taking into consideration the specific risks and benefits pertaining to the individual patient’s medical situation, as well as the most current medical guidelines. Coumadin exposure during pregnancy causes a recognized pattern of major congenital malformations (warfarin embryopathy and fetotoxicity), fatal fetal hemorrhage, and an increased risk of spontaneous abortion and fetal mortality. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus.\n- Females of Reproductive Potential\n- Coumadin exposure during pregnancy can cause pregnancy loss, birth defects, or fetal death. Discuss pregnancy planning with females of reproductive potential who are on Coumadin therapy.\n- Other Clinical Settings with Increased Risks\n- In the following clinical settings, the risks of Coumadin therapy may be increased:\n- Moderate to severe hepatic impairment\n- Polycythemia vera - Vasculitis - Diabetes mellitus\n- Endogenous Factors Affecting INR\n- The following factors may be responsible for increased INR response: diarrhea, hepatic disorders, poor nutritional state, steatorrhea, or vitamin K deficiency.\n\n【10】 ## Clinical Trials Experience\nThere is limited information regarding Clinical Trial Experience of Warfarin (oral) in the drug label.\n\n【11】 ## Postmarketing Experience\n\n【12】 - Hemorrhage.\n- Necrosis of skin and other tissues.\n- Systemic atheroembolism and cholesterol microemboli.\nChills\nNausea, vomiting, diarrhea, taste alteration, abdominal pain, flatulence, bloating, hepatitis, elevated liver enzymes. Cholestatic hepatitis has been associated with concomitant administration of Coumadin and ticlopidine.\nTracheal or tracheobronchial calcification\nRash, dermatitis (including bullous eruptions), pruritus, alopecia, hypersensitivity/allergic reactions (including urticaria and anaphylactic reactions), vasculitis\n\n【13】 #Drug Interactions\n- Drugs may interact with Coumadin through pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic mechanisms. Pharmacodynamic mechanisms for drug interactions with Coumadin are synergism (impaired hemostasis, reduced clotting factor synthesis), competitive antagonism (vitamin K), and alteration of the physiologic control loop for vitamin K metabolism (hereditary resistance). Pharmacokinetic mechanisms for drug interactions with Coumadin are mainly enzyme induction, enzyme inhibition, and reduced plasma protein binding. It is important to note that some drugs may interact by more than one mechanism.\n- More frequent INR monitoring should be performed when starting or stopping other drugs, including botanicals, or when changing dosages of other drugs, including drugs intended for short-term use (e.g. antibiotics, antifungals, corticosteroids).\n- Consult the labeling of all concurrently used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with Coumadin or adverse reactions pertaining to bleeding.\n- CYP450 isozymes involved in the metabolism of warfarin include CYP2C9, 2C19, 2C8, 2C18, 1A2, and 3A4. The more potent warfarin S-enantiomer is metabolized by CYP2C9 while the R-enantiomer is metabolized by CYP1A2 and 3A4.\n- Inhibitors of CYP2C9, 1A2, and/or 3A4 have the potential to increase the effect (increase INR) of warfarin by increasing the exposure of warfarin.\nConsult the labeling of all concurrently used drugs to obtain further information about CYP450 interaction potential. The CYP450 inhibition and induction potential should be considered when starting, stopping, or changing dose of concomitant mediations. Closely monitor INR if a concomitant drug is a CYP2C9, 1A2, and/or 3A4 inhibitor or inducer.\nBecause bleeding risk is increased when these drugs are used concomitantly with warfarin, closely monitor patients receiving any such drug with warfarin.\n- There have been reports of changes in INR in patients taking warfarin and antibiotics or antifungals, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of these agents on plasma concentrations of warfarin.\n- Closely monitor INR when starting or stopping any antibiotic or antifungal in patients taking warfarin.\n- Some botanicals may cause bleeding events when taken alone (e.g. garlic and Ginkgo biloba) and may have anticoagulant, antiplatelet, and/or fibrinolytic properties. These effects would be expected to be additive to the anticoagulant effects of Coumadin. Conversely, some botanicals may decrease the effects of Coumadin (e.g. co-enzyme Q10, St. John’s wort, ginseng). Some botanicals and foods can interact with Coumadin through CYP450 interactions (e.g. echinacea, grapefruit juice, ginkgo, goldenseal, St. John’s wort).\n- Monitor the patient’s response with additional INR determinations when initiating or discontinuing any botanicals.\n\n【14】 ### Pregnancy\nPregnancy Category (FDA):\n- Pregnancy Category:\n- Coumadin is contraindicated in women who are pregnant except in pregnant women with mechanical heart valves, who are at high risk of thromboembolism, and for whom the benefits of Coumadin may outweigh the risks. Coumadin can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Coumadin exposure during pregnancy causes a recognized pattern of major congenital malformations (warfarin embryopathy), fetal hemorrhage, and an increased risk of spontaneous abortion and fetal mortality. The reproductive and developmental effects of Coumadin have not been evaluated in animals. If this drug is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.\n- Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) Pregnancy Category\nThere is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Warfarin (oral) in women who are pregnant.\n\n【15】 ### Labor and Delivery\nThere is no FDA guidance on use of Warfarin (oral) during labor and delivery.\n\n【16】 ### Nursing Mothers\n- Based on published data in 15 nursing mothers, warfarin was not detected in human milk. Among the 15 full-term newborns, 6 nursing infants had documented prothrombin times within the expected range. Prothrombin times were not obtained for the other 9 nursing infants. Monitor breast-feeding infants for bruising or bleeding. Effects in premature infants have not been evaluated. Caution should be exercised when Coumadin is administered to a nursing woman.\n\n【17】 ### Pediatric Use\n- Adequate and well-controlled studies with Coumadin have not been conducted in any pediatric population, and the optimum dosing, safety, and efficacy in pediatric patients is unknown. Pediatric use of Coumadin is based on adult data and recommendations, and available limited pediatric data from observational studies and patient registries. Pediatric patients administered Coumadin should avoid any activity or sport that may result in traumatic injury.\n- The developing hemostatic system in infants and children results in a changing physiology of thrombosis and response to anticoagulants. Dosing of warfarin in the pediatric population varies by patient age, with infants generally having the highest, and adolescents having the lowest milligram per kilogram dose requirements to maintain target INRs. Because of changing warfarin requirements due to age, concomitant medications, diet, and existing medical condition, target INR ranges may be difficult to achieve and maintain in pediatric patients, and more frequent INR determinations are recommended. Bleeding rates varied by patient population and clinical care center in pediatric observational studies and patient registries.\n- Infants and children receiving vitamin K-supplemented nutrition, including infant formulas, may be resistant to warfarin therapy, while human milk-fed infants may be sensitive to warfarin therapy.\n\n【18】 ### Geriatic Use\n- Of the total number of patients receiving warfarin sodium in controlled clinical trials for which data were available for analysis, 1885 patients (24.4%) were 65 years and older, while 185 patients (2.4%) were 75 years and older. No overall differences in effectiveness or safety were observed between these patients and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.\n- Patients 60 years or older appear to exhibit greater than expected INR response to the anticoagulant effects of warfarin. Coumadin is contraindicated in any unsupervised patient with senility. Observe caution with administration of Coumadin to elderly patients in any situation or with any physical condition where added risk of hemorrhage is present. Consider lower initiation and maintenance doses of Coumadin in elderly patients.\n\n【19】 ### Gender\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Warfarin (oral) with respect to specific gender populations.\n\n【20】 ### Race\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Warfarin (oral) with respect to specific racial populations.\n\n【21】 ### Renal Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Warfarin (oral) in patients with renal impairment.\n\n【22】 ### Hepatic Impairment\n- Hepatic impairment can potentiate the response to warfarin through impaired synthesis of clotting factors and decreased metabolism of warfarin. Use caution when using Coumadin in these patients.\n\n【23】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Warfarin (oral) in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n\n【24】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\nThere is no FDA guidance one the use of Warfarin (oral) in patients who are immunocompromised.\n\n【25】 ### Administration\n- Oral\n- Intravenous\n\n【26】 ### Monitoring\n- Perform regular monitoring of INR in all treated patients\n\n【27】 #IV Compatibility\nThere is limited information regarding IV Compatibility of Warfarin (oral) in the drug label.\n\n【28】 ### Signs and Symptoms\n- Bleeding (e.g. appearance of blood in stools or urine, hematuria, excessive menstrual bleeding, melena, petechiae, excessive bruising or persistent oozing from superficial injuries, unexplained fall in hemoglobin) is a manifestation of excessive anticoagulation.\n\n【29】 ### Management\n- The treatment of excessive anticoagulation is based on the level of the INR, the presence or absence of bleeding, and clinical circumstances. Reversal of Coumadin anticoagulation may be obtained by discontinuing Coumadin therapy and, if necessary, by administration of oral or parenteral vitamin K1.\n- Prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), fresh frozen plasma, or activated Factor VII treatment may be considered if the requirement to reverse the effects of Coumadin is urgent. A risk of hepatitis and other viral diseases is associated with the use of blood products; PCC and activated Factor VII are also associated with an increased risk of thrombosis. Therefore, these preparations should be used only in exceptional or life-threatening bleeding episodes secondary to Coumadin overdosage.\n\n【30】 ## Chronic Overdose\nThere is limited information regarding Chronic Overdose of Warfarin (oral) in the drug label.\n\n【31】 ## Mechanism of Action\n- Warfarin acts by inhibiting the synthesis of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, which include Factors II, VII, IX, and X, and the anticoagulant proteins C and S. Vitamin K is an essential cofactor for the post ribosomal synthesis of the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. Vitamin K promotes the biosynthesis of γ-carboxyglutamic acid residues in the proteins that are essential for biological activity. Warfarin is thought to interfere with clotting factor synthesis by inhibition of the C1 subunit of vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKORC1) enzyme complex, thereby reducing the regeneration of vitamin K1 epoxide.\n\n【32】 ## Structure\n- Coumadin (warfarin sodium) is an anticoagulant that acts by inhibiting vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors. Chemically, it is 3-(α-acetonylbenzyl)-4-hydroxycoumarin and is a racemic mixture of the R- and S-enantiomers. Crystalline warfarin sodium is an isopropanol clathrate. Its empirical formula is C19H15NaO4, and its structural formula is represented by the following:\n- Crystalline warfarin sodium occurs as a white, odorless, crystalline powder that is discolored by light. It is very soluble in water, freely soluble in alcohol, and very slightly soluble in chloroform and ether.\n- Coumadin for injection for intravenous use is supplied as a sterile, lyophilized powder, which, after reconstitution with 2.7 mL Sterile Water for Injection, contains:\n\n【33】 ## Pharmacodynamics\n- An anticoagulation effect generally occurs within 24 hours after warfarin administration. However, peak anticoagulant effect may be delayed 72 to 96 hours. The duration of action of a single dose of racemic warfarin is 2 to 5 days. The effects of Coumadin may become more pronounced as effects of daily maintenance doses overlap. This is consistent with the half-lives of the affected vitamin K-dependent clotting factors and anticoagulation proteins: Factor II - 60 hours, VII - 4 to 6 hours, IX - 24 hours, X - 48 to 72 hours, and proteins C and S are approximately 8 hours and 30 hours, respectively.\n- CYP2C9 and VKORC1 Polymorphisms\n- The S-enantiomer of warfarin is mainly metabolized to 7-hydroxywarfarin by CYP2C9, a polymorphic enzyme. The variant alleles, CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3, result in decreased in vitro CYP2C9 enzymatic 7-hydroxylation of S-warfarin. The frequencies of these alleles in Caucasians are approximately 11% and 7% for CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3, respectively.\n- Other CYP2C9 alleles associated with reduced enzymatic activity occur at lower frequencies, including *5, *6, and *11 alleles in populations of African ancestry and *5, *9, and *11 alleles in Caucasians.\n- Warfarin reduces the regeneration of vitamin K from vitamin K epoxide in the vitamin K cycle through inhibition of VKOR, a multiprotein enzyme complex. Certain single nucleotide polymorphisms in the VKORC1 gene (e.g. –1639G>A) have been associated with variable warfarin dose requirements. VKORC1 and CYP2C9 gene variants generally explain the largest proportion of known variability in warfarin dose requirements.\n\n【34】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n- Coumadin is a racemic mixture of the R- and S-enantiomers of warfarin. The S-enantiomer exhibits 2 to 5 times more anticoagulant activity than the R-enantiomer in humans, but generally has a more rapid clearance.\n- Warfarin is essentially completely absorbed after oral administration, with peak concentration generally attained within the first 4 hours.\n- Warfarin distributes into a relatively small apparent volume of distribution of about 0.14 L/kg. A distribution phase lasting 6 to 12 hours is distinguishable after rapid intravenous or oral administration of an aqueous solution. Approximately 99% of the drug is bound to plasma proteins.\n- The elimination of warfarin is almost entirely by metabolism. Warfarin is stereoselectively metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 (CYP450) microsomal enzymes to inactive hydroxylated metabolites (predominant route) and by reductases to reduced metabolites (warfarin alcohols) with minimal anticoagulant activity. Identified metabolites of warfarin include dehydrowarfarin, two diastereoisomer alcohols, and 4′-, 6-, 7-, 8-, and 10-hydroxywarfarin. The CYP450 isozymes involved in the metabolism of warfarin include CYP2C9, 2C19, 2C8, 2C18, 1A2, and 3A4. CYP2C9, a polymorphic enzyme, is likely to be the principal form of human liver CYP450 that modulates the in vivo anticoagulant activity of warfarin. Patients with one or more variant CYP2C9 alleles have decreased S-warfarin clearance.\n- Patients 60 years or older appear to exhibit greater than expected INR response to the anticoagulant effects of warfarin. The cause of the increased sensitivity to the anticoagulant effects of warfarin in this age group is unknown but may be due to a combination of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic factors. Limited information suggests there is no difference in the clearance of S-warfarin; however, there may be a slight decrease in the clearance of R-warfarin in the elderly as compared to the young. Therefore, as patient age increases, a lower dose of warfarin is usually required to produce a therapeutic level of anticoagulation.\n- Asian patients may require lower initiation and maintenance doses of warfarin. A non-controlled study of 151 Chinese outpatients stabilized on warfarin for various indications reported a mean daily warfarin requirement of 3.3 ± 1.4 mg to achieve an INR of 2 to 2.5. Patient age was the most important determinant of warfarin requirement in these patients, with a progressively lower warfarin requirement with increasing age.\n\n【35】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\n- Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\n\n【36】 #Clinical Studies\n- In five prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trials involving 3711 patients with non-rheumatic AF, warfarin significantly reduced the risk of systemic thromboembolism including stroke . The risk reduction ranged from 60% to 86% in all except one trial (CAFA: 45%), which was stopped early due to published positive results from two of these trials. The incidence of major bleeding in these trials ranged from 0.6% to 2.7% .\n- Trials in patients with both AF and mitral stenosis suggest a benefit from anticoagulation with Coumadin.\n- WARIS (The Warfarin Re-Infarction Study) was a double-blind, randomized study of 1214 patients 2 to 4 weeks post-infarction treated with warfarin to a target INR of 2.8 to 4.8. The primary endpoint was a composite of total mortality and recurrent infarction. A secondary endpoint of cerebrovascular events was assessed. Mean follow-up of the patients was 37 months\n- There were approximately four times as many major bleeding episodes in the two groups receiving warfarin than in the group receiving aspirin alone. Major bleeding episodes were not more frequent among patients receiving aspirin plus warfarin than among those receiving warfarin alone, but the incidence of minor bleeding episodes was higher in the combined therapy group.\n\n【37】 #How Supplied\n- Tablets\n- Coumadin tablets are single-scored, with one face imprinted numerically with 1, 2, 2-1/2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7-1/2, or 10 superimposed and inscribed with “Coumadin” and with the opposite face plain. Coumadin is available in bottles and hospital unit-dose blister packages with potencies and colors as follows:\n- Protect from light and moisture.

There may be new information. This Medication Guide does not take the place of talking to your healthcare provider about your medical condition or your treatment.\n\n【1】 #What is the most important information I should know about CIPRO?\nCIPRO belongs to a class of antibiotics called fluoroquinolones. CIPRO can cause side effects that may be serious or even cause death. If you get any of the following serious side effects, get medical help right away. Talk with your healthcare provider about whether you should continue to take CIPRO.\n1. Tendon rupture or swelling of the tendon (tendinitis)\n-Tendon problems can happen in people of all ages who take CIPRO. Tendons are tough cords of tissue that connect muscles to bones. Symptoms of tendon problems may include:\n-Pain, swelling, tears and inflammation of tendons including the back of the ankle (Achilles), shoulder, hand, or other tendon sites.\n-The risk of getting tendon problems while you take CIPRO is higher if you:\n-Are over 60 years of age\n-Are taking steroids (corticosteroids)\n-Have had a kidney, heart or lung transplant\n-Physical activity or exercise\n-Kidney failure\n-Tendon problems in the past, such as in people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA)\n-Call your healthcare provider right away at the first sign of tendon pain, swelling or inflammation. Stop taking CIPRO until tendinitis or tendon rupture has been ruled out by your healthcare provider. Avoid exercise and using the affected area. The most common area of pain and swelling is the Achilles tendon at the back of your ankle. This can also happen with other tendons.\n-Talk to your healthcare provider about the risk of tendon rupture with continued use of CIPRO. You may need a different antibiotic that is not a fluoroquinolone to treat your infection.\n-Get medical help right away if you get any of the following signs or symptoms of a tendon rupture:\n-Hear or feel a snap or pop in a tendon area -Bruising right after an injury in a tendon area -Unable to move the affected area or bear weight\n2. Worsening of myasthenia gravis (a disease which causes muscle weakness). Fluoroquinolones like CIPRO may cause worsening of myasthenia gravis symptoms, including muscle weakness and breathing problems. Call your healthcare provider right away if you have any worsening muscle weakness or breathing problems.\n\n【2】 #What is CIPRO?\nCIPRO is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic medicine used to treat certain infections caused by certain germs called bacteria.\n\n【3】 CIPRO Tablets, CIPRO Oral Suspension and CIPRO IV should not be used in children under 18 years old, except to treat specific serious infections, such as complicated urinary tract infections and to prevent anthrax disease after breathing the anthrax bacteria germ (inhalational exposure). It is not known if CIPRO XR is safe and works in children under 18 years of age.\nSometimes infections are caused by viruses rather than by bacteria. Examples include viral infections in the sinuses and lungs, such as the common cold or flu. Antibiotics, including CIPRO, do not kill viruses.\nCall your healthcare provider if you think your condition is not getting better while you are taking CIPRO.\n\n【4】 #Who should not take CIPRO?\nDo not take CIPRO if you:\n-Have ever had a severe allergic reaction to an antibiotic known as a fluoroquinolone, or are allergic to any of the ingredients in CIPRO. Ask your healthcare provider if you are not sure.  the list of ingredients in CIPRO at the end of this Medication Guide.\n-Also take a medicine called tizanidine (Zanaflex). Serious side effects from tizanidine are likely to happen.\nWhat should I tell my healthcare provider before taking CIPRO?\n“What is the most important information I should know about CIPRO?”.\nTell your healthcare provider about all your medical conditions, including if you:\n-Have tendon problems.\n-Have a disease that causes muscle weakness (myasthenia gravis).\n-Have central nervous system problems (such as epilepsy).\n-Have or anyone in your family has an irregular heartbeat, especially a condition called “QT prolongation”.\n-Have a history of seizures.\n-Have kidney problems. You may need a lower dose of CIPRO if your kidneys do not work well.\n\n【5】 -Are pregnant or planning to become pregnant. It is not known if CIPRO will harm your unborn child.\n-Are breast-feeding or planning to breast-feed. CIPRO passes into breast milk. You and your healthcare provider should decide whether you will take CIPRO or breast-feed.\nTell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription and non-prescription medicines, vitamins and herbal and dietary supplements. CIPRO and other medicines can affect each other causing side effects. Especially tell your healthcare provider if you take:\n-An NSAID (Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug). Many common medicines for pain relief are NSAIDs. Taking an NSAID while you take CIPRO or other fluoroquinolones may increase your risk of central nervous system effects and seizures.  \"What are the possible side effects of CIPRO?.\"\n-A blood thinner (such as warfarin, Coumadin, Jantoven).\n-Tizanidine (Zanaflex). You should not take CIPRO if you are already taking tizanidine.  “Who should not take CIPRO?”.\n-Theophylline (such as Theo-24, Elixophyllin, Theochron, Uniphyl, Theolair).\n-Glyburide (Micronase, Glynase, Diabeta, Glucovance).  “What are the possible side effects of CIPRO?”.\n-Phenytoin (Fosphenytoin Sodium, Cerebyx, Dilantin-125, Dilantin, Extended Phenytoin Sodium, Prompt Phenytoin Sodium, Phenytek).\n-Products that contain caffeine.\n-A medicine to control your heart rate or rhythm (antiarrhythmics)  “What are the possible side effects of CIPRO?”.\n-An anti-psychotic medicine.\n-A tricyclic antidepressant.\n-A water pill (diuretic).\n-A steroid medicine. Corticosteroids taken by mouth or by injection may increase the chance of tendon injury.  “What is the most important information I should know about CIPRO?”.\n-Methotrexate (Trexall)\n-Probenecid (Probalan, Col-probenecid).\n-Metoclopromide (Reglan, Reglan ODT).\n-Ropinirole (Requip).\n-Lidocaine (Xylocaine intravenous infusion).\n-Clozapine (Clozaril, Fazaclo ODT).\n-Pentoxifylline (Trental).\n-Sildenafil (Viagra, Revatio).\n-Cyclosporine (Gengraf, Neoral, Sandimmune, Sangcya).\n-Omeprazole.\n-Certain medicines may keep CIPRO Tablets, CIPRO Oral Suspension from working correctly. Take CIPRO Tablets and Oral Suspension either 2 hours before or 6 hours after taking these products:\n-An antacid, multivitamin, or other product that has magnesium, calcium, aluminum, iron, or zinc.\n-Sucralfate (Carafate).\n-Didanosine (Videx, Videx EC).\nAsk your healthcare provider if you are not sure if any of your medicines are listed above.\nKnow the medicines you take. Keep a list of your medicines and show it to your healthcare provider and pharmacist when you get a new medicine.\n\n【6】 #How should I take CIPRO?\nTake CIPRO exactly as prescribed by your healthcare provider.\nTake CIPRO Tablets in the morning and evening at about the same time each day. Swallow the tablet whole. Do not split, crush or chew the tablet. Tell your healthcare provider if you can not swallow the tablet whole.\nCIPRO IV is given to you by intravenous (IV) infusion into your vein, slowly, over 60 minutes, as prescribed by your healthcare provider.\nCIPRO can be taken with or without food.\nDrink plenty of fluids while taking CIPRO.\nDo not skip any doses, or stop taking CIPRO even if you begin to feel better, until you finish your prescribed treatment, unless:\nYou have tendon effects ,\nYour healthcare provider tells you to stop.\nThis will help make sure that all of the bacteria are killed and lower the chance that the bacteria will become resistant to CIPRO. If this happens, CIPRO and other antibiotic medicines may not work in the future.\nIf you miss a dose of CIPRO Tablets or Oral Suspension, take it as soon as you remember. Do not take two doses at the same time, and do not take more than two doses in one day.\nIf you take too much, call your healthcare provider or get medical help immediately.\nIf you have been prescribed CIPRO Tablets, CIPRO Oral Suspension or CIPRO IV after being exposed to anthrax:\nCIPRO Tablets, Oral Suspension and IV has been approved to lessen the chance of getting anthrax disease or worsening of the disease after you are exposed to the anthrax bacteria germ.\nSide effects may happen while you are taking CIPRO Tablets, Oral Suspension or IV When taking your CIPRO to prevent anthrax infection, you and your healthcare provider should talk about whether the risks of stopping CIPRO too soon are more important than the risks of side effects with CIPRO.\n\n【7】 #What should I avoid while taking CIPRO?\nCIPRO can make you feel dizzy and lightheaded. Do not drive, operate machinery, or do other activities that require mental alertness or coordination until you know how CIPRO affects you.\nAvoid sunlamps, tanning beds, and try to limit your time in the sun. CIPRO can make your skin sensitive to the sun (photosensitivity) and the light from sunlamps and tanning beds. You could get severe sunburn, blisters or swelling of your skin. If you get any of these symptoms while taking CIPRO, call your healthcare provider right away. You should use a sunscreen and wear a hat and clothes that cover your skin if you have to be in sunlight.\n\n【8】 #What are the possible side effects of CIPRO?\nCIPRO can cause side effects that may be serious or even cause death.  “What is the most important information I should know about CIPRO?”\nOther serious side effects of CIPRO include:\n\n【9】 #Theophylline\nYou may have serious seizure and breathing problems when you take theophylline with CIPRO. These problems may lead to death. Get emergency help right away if you have seizures or trouble breathing.\n\n【10】 #Central Nervous System effects\nSeizures have been reported in people who take fluoroquinolone antibiotics including CIPRO. Tell your healthcare provider if you have a history of seizures. Ask your healthcare provider whether taking CIPRO will change your risk of having a seizure.\nCentral Nervous System (CNS) side effects may happen as soon as after taking the first dose of CIPRO. Talk to your healthcare provider right away if you get any of these side effects, or other changes in mood or behavior:\nFeel dizzy\nSeizures\nHear voices, see things, or sense things that are not there (hallucinations)\nFeel restless\nTremors\nFeel anxious or nervous\nConfusion\nDepression\nTrouble sleeping\nNightmares\nFeel more suspicious (paranoia)\nSuicidal thoughts or acts\nSerious allergic reactions\nAllergic reactions, including death, can happen in people taking fluoroquinolones, including CIPRO, even after only one dose. Stop taking CIPRO and get emergency medical help right away if you get any of the following symptoms of a severe allergic reaction:\nHives.\nTrouble breathing or swallowing.\nSwelling of the lips, tongue, face.\nThroat tightness, hoarseness.\nRapid heartbeat.\nFaint.\nYellowing of the skin or eyes. Stop taking CIPRO and tell your healthcare provider right away if you get yellowing of your skin or white part of your eyes, or if you have dark urine. These can be signs of a serious reaction to CIPRO (a liver problem).\nSkin rash\nSkin rash may happen in people taking CIPRO even after only one dose. Stop taking CIPRO at the first sign of a skin rash and call your healthcare provider. Skin rash may be a sign of a more serious reaction to CIPRO.\nSerious heart rhythm changes (QT prolongation and torsade de pointes)\nTell your healthcare provider right away if you have a change in your heart beat (a fast or irregular heartbeat), or if you faint. CIPRO may cause a rare heart problem known as prolongation of the QT interval. This condition can cause an abnormal heartbeat and can be very dangerous. The chances of this event are higher in people:\nWho are elderly\nWith a family history of prolonged QT interval\nWith low blood potassium (hypokalemia)\nWho take certain medicines to control heart rhythm (antiarrhythmics)\nIntestine infection (Pseudomembranous colitis)\nPseudomembranous colitis can happen with most antibiotics, including CIPRO. Call your healthcare provider right away if you get watery diarrhea, diarrhea that does not go away, or bloody stools. You may have stomach cramps and a fever. Pseudomembranous colitis can happen 2 or more months after you have finished your antibiotic.\nChanges in sensation and nerve damage (Peripheral Neuropathy)\nDamage to the nerves in arms, hands, legs, or feet can happen in people who take fluoroquinolones, including CIPRO. Stop CIPRO and with your healthcare provider right away if you get any of the following symptoms of peripheral neuropathy in your arms, hands, legs, or feet:\nPain\nBurning\nTingling\nNumbness\nWeakness\nThe nerve damage may be permanent.\nLow blood sugar (hypoglycemia)\nPeople who take CIPRO and other fluoroquinolone medicines with the oral anti-diabetes medicine glyburide (Micronase, Glynase, Diabeta, Glucovance) can get low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) which can sometimes be severe. Tell your healthcare provider if you get low blood sugar with CIPRO. Your antibiotic medicine may need to be changed.\nSensitivity to sunlight (photosensitivity).  “What should I avoid while taking CIPRO?”.\n\n【11】 The most common side effects of CIPRO include:\nNausea\nDiarrhea\nChanges in liver function tests\nVomiting\nRash\nVaginal yeast infection\nHeadache\nThese are not all the possible side effects of CIPRO. Tell your healthcare provider about any side effect that bothers you, or that does not go away.\nCall your doctor for medical advice about side effects.

(October 31 1923 – August 30 2006) was a medical doctor, scientist and researcher who published over 48 medical papers and a three-volume monograph, Vitamin C. During his hospital and teaching career he specialised in obstetrics and gynecology. After retirement in 1991 he devoted his time to researching and publishing papers on Barlow's disease (scurvy in infants), particularly arguing this to be the major cause of Shaken baby syndrome.\n\n【1】 #Biography\nDr. Clemetson was born in Canterbury, England, attending Wootton Court preparatory school, Wootton, Kent  and The King's School, Canterbury . degree.\nHe married Helen Cowan Forster, a physiotherapist, on March 29, 1947. They had four children.\nAfter graduation, he became a Royal Air Force medical officer for two years, and then returned to Oxford University in 1950 for a MA degree. In 1950, as a research assistant in Obstetrics, he started to pursue research into preeclamptic toxaemia and started to publish medical papers in 1953. In 1951-1952, he was named a Nichols Research Fellow of the Royal Society of Medicine. From 1952 through 1956, he served at various hospitals in England as the House Surgeon of either Obstetrics or Gynecology, and, in 1956, became a lecturer in Obstetrics and Gynecology at London University.\nThen, in 1961, he moved to California and assumed a position as an assistant professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the University of California Medical Center in San Francisco, and a lecturer in the Department of Maternal and Child Health with the University of California, Berkeley.\nIn 1967, he assumed a teaching position (1967–1972) as an assistant professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology with the State University of New York, Brooklyn. He also became the Director of the Obstetrics and Gynecology Department  at the Methodist Hospital of Brooklyn, New York. In addition , he served as a professor in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Downstate Medical Center of the State University of New York, Brooklyn, New York.\nUpon his retirement in 1991, as a Professor Emeritus, Tulane University School of Medicine, Dr. Clemetson devoted his remaining years to writing and publishing medical papers concerning Shaken baby syndrome.\nNear the end of his life he narrowly escaped the New Orleans disaster from Hurricane Katrina, having been warned by the meteorologist brother-in-law of his carer. He escaped with the latter over the Lake Pontchartrain bridge the day before it was destroyed. He lived in Houston, Texas for nearly a year while his family restored his house, but died of heart failure a few weeks after this was completed.\n\n【2】 #Achievements\nDr. Clemetson had a long and distinguished academic career as a medical doctor, scientist and researcher. During his forty year professional career, he implemented numerous scientific studies and was instrumental in furthering scientific knowledge.\nThe following listed achievements are highlights of his life’s work that are contained in his extensive Curriculum Vitae.\n- University College Hospital – London – 1950-1952 / 1956-1958\nDemonstrated the effects of cord around the neck and of preeclampsia on the oxygen saturation of newborn infants.\nPublished the first study of “small-for-dates” infants in his studies of “the difference in birth weight of human twins.”\nDemonstrated aortic hypoplasia in some patients following severe early preeclampsia.\nPerformed and published successful open cardiac massage outside of hospital.\nUniversity of California Medical Center – San Francisco – 1961–1967\nBioflavonoids and catechins - Solved the old “Vitamin P” problem, by showing that bioflavonoids with certain structural characteristics act as indirect antioxidants for Vitamin C. : Plant Polyphenols Monograph in New York Academy of Sciences.\nPreeclampsia - Demonstrated a disturbance of ascorbic acid metabolism in preeclampsia and in abruptio placentae.\nMethodist Hospital of Brooklyn – New York – 1967–1981\nDeveloped a new method for measuring the bilirubin content of amniotic fluid.\n\n【3】 He showed conclusively that women on the pill need more Vitamin C than usual, and, as a result of this, a special vitamin formula called “Feminins” was developed and marketed for women on the pill.\nHis research on the uterine luminal fluid in the rat showed that estrogen causes secretion and progesterone causes reabsorption of uterine luminal fluid.\nIn recent research, he has shown that people with low vitamin C levels have very high blood histamine levels.\nTulane University School of Medicine 1981–1990\nWrote three-volume monograph, Vitamin C, published by CRC Press in 1989.\n- Demonstrated impaired active transfer of amino acids from mother to fetus in preeclampsia.\n- In collaboration with Drs. Mallikarjuneswara and Moshfeghi, he was able to measure the electrical charge on fertilized rat ova, and this was the first time that anyone had ever measured the electrical charge on any mammalian ovum.\n- He was able to relate the above observation to abruptio placentae, as women with low ascorbate (Vitamin C) and high histamine levels are prone to develop premature separation of the placenta.\n\n【4】 #Medical hypotheses\nIn 1964, Dr. Clemetson conducted and  published the first studies  concerning ascorbic acid (vitamin C) metabolism and depletion in preeclampsia.\nAfter Dr. Clemetson’s retirement from teaching in 1991, his work focused on developing the hypothesis that the hemorrhages seen in infants with Shaken baby syndrome are caused not by inflicted trauma, but by capillary damage due to Barlow's disease (subclinical scurvy) - a condition called by proponents Clemetson/Kalokerinos syndrome. The mechanism he argued to be high histamine levels associated with low serum vitamin C, the latter deficiency arising before birth due to factors such as the pregnant mother's malnutrition, and in the infant by recurrent infections and recent multiple vaccinations.\nHis four main papers on this topic, published in the journal Medical Hypotheses, are: The Key Role of Histamine in the Development of Atherosclerosis and Coronary heart disease; Barlow's disease  ; Capillary Fragility as a Cause of Subdural Hemorrhage in Infants ; and Elevated Blood Histamine Caused by Vaccinations and Vitamin C Deficiency May Mimic the Shaken Baby Syndrome .\n\n【5】 #Work cited\nCommission on Life Sciences - National Academies Press (USA)\n- Recommended Dietary Allowances: 10th Edition\n- Biologic Markers in Reproductive Toxicology\n\n【6】 #Publications\nBooks\n- Vitamin C, Volumes I, II, III.

{"seq_id": "9ea2a4dc-dd16-4786-a38a-2a63dd0a445e", "title": null, "text": "【0】 #Background\nUrinary bladder cancer is the fourth most common cancer among men and accounts for 8% of all new male cancer cases. Urinary bladder cancer is less common among women (ranked 11th) and accounts for less than 3% of all new female cancer cases. Statistics Canada estimates that in 2020 there were approximately 12,200 new cases of bladder cancer and 2,600 deaths associated with bladder cancer in Canada. 1 Smoking is estimated to account for between 34% and 50% of all bladder cancers. 2,3 There are several histological types of bladder cancer. Urothelial carcinoma (also known as transitional cell carcinoma, henceforth referred to as urothelial) is the most common subtype, accounting for more than 90% of all cases in North America. Other histologic variants include squamous differentiation, glandular differentiation, nested pattern, microcystic, micropapillary, lymphoepithelioma-like, plasmacytoid and lymphoma-like, sarcomatoid/carcinosarcoma, giant cell, trophoblastic differentiation, clear cell, lipid cell, and undifferentiated. 4 Other important histologic variants include adenocarcinoma (urachal and non-urachal) and small cell carcinoma. Less commonly, urothelial cancers can arise in other parts of the urinary tract including the renal pelvis, ureter and urethra.\n\n【1】 The objective of this guideline is to provide physicians with the latest, evidence-based management strategies for muscle-invasive bladder cancer in Alberta. Guidelines for non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer, locally advanced/metastatic bladder cancer, and upper tract urothelial cancer are available separately.\n\n【2】 #Target Population\nAdult patients (age ≥18 years) with a diagnosis of non-metastatic, muscle-invasive bladder cancer, including patients with a single regional lymph node metastasis in the true pelvis ,T2a-T4a, N0-1, M0\n\n【3】 #Therapy with curative intent:\n-All patients should be discussed in a multidisciplinary setting, and be made aware of their curative intent treatment options.\n-Either a surgical ,radical cystectomy with bilateral and extended lymph node dissection with urinary diversion or neobladder reconstruction trimodality bladder-preserving approach can be considered.  -In patients unable to tolerate either a surgical or bladder-preserving approach due to medical comorbidities, poor performance status, or patient choice, consider TURBT +/-radiotherapy or chemotherapy, TURBT alone, radiotherapy alone, or chemotherapy alone, although the odds of cure are low.\n\n【4】 #A. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy i.\nNeoadjuvant chemotherapy is considered standard of care prior to radical cystectomy in patients with muscle-invasive urothelial bladder cancer. It may also be considered on a case-by-case basis for patients who are planned to receive a bladder preservation / combined modality approach.\nii. Where possible, neoadjuvant chemotherapy is strongly preferred over adjuvant chemotherapy.\niii. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy should be cisplatin-based combination therapy. Options include cisplatin-gemcitabine or dose-dense MVAC. 19,20 A total of 4 cycles should be planned. 21,22 A standard dosing option for each regimen is provided below: a. vi. For patients receiving cisplatin-gemcitabine, a CT scan of abdomen and pelvis should be performed after 2 cycles to exclude progression. If disease progression has occurred, then neoadjuvant chemotherapy should be abandoned and the patient should be taken to surgery if feasible.\n\n【5】 #B. Radical cystectomy with bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection\ni. Radical cystectomy with bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND), followed by urinary diversion. Options for urinary diversion include continent reservoir and conduit diversion. There are insufficient data to recommend one procedure over another.\nii. Ileal neobladder reconstruction can be considered in carefully selected patients with bladder-confined, node-negative urothelial carcinoma with good kidney and liver function. 25,26 iii. Extended template PLND can include the presacral and common iliac lymph nodes to the aortic bifurcation.  iv. Non-urothelial histologies should be considered on a case-by-case basis and discussed in multi-disciplinary tumor boards/rounds. v. All patients who are eligible for cisplatin-based chemotherapy should have the opportunity to discuss neoadjuvant therapy with a medical oncologist before surgery, as this has been shown to result in improved survival versus surgery alone 32,33 .\nvi. In cases where neoadjuvant chemotherapy was not received and/or completed, adjuvant chemotherapy can be considered on a case-by-case basis pending postsurgical pathology .\nC. Bladder preservation / combined modality approach i. Bladder preservation therapy is best suited for those with a solitary lesion which has been maximally resected with TURBT and the following features: no CIS, no evidence of hydronephrosis, urothelial histology, adequate bladder volume, clinically negative lymph nodes, and absence of significant lower urinary tract irritative symptoms. 21,22,34 ii. Optimal bladder preservation strategies consist of radiotherapy combined with concurrent chemotherapy following a maximal TURBT. 35 iii. Prior to bladder preservation there should be a complete resection of the bladder tumour; if more than eight weeks have elapsed since TURBT, or symptoms are recurrent, consider repeat cystoscopy/ TURBT prior to initiation of concurrent chemoradiation if safely possible. viii. Prior to definitive chemoradiation, neoadjuvant chemotherapy may be considered on a case-by-case basis, although there is no level I evidence to support this . iv. Radiotherapy should be delivered to the whole bladder (+/-regional nodes to at least 40 Gy), followed by a bladder/ tumour boost to at least 60 Gy in conventional fractionation; altered fractionation regimens, such as 50-52.5 Gy in 20 fractions may also be considered. v. In cystectomy candidates, second-look cystoscopy +/-biopsy and urine cytology is recommended after 40-50 Gy to ensure response. If no response, bladder preservation approach should be abandoned and salvage cystectomy should be considered. vi. Commonly used concurrent chemotherapy regimens include: weekly cisplatin, 5-FU plus Mitomycin C. 36,37  ii. Adjuvant chemotherapy should be considered for patients with resected urothelial carcinoma with either pT3-T4 or pN1-3 disease on pathology review of the surgical specimen.\niii. Adjuvant chemotherapy with a cisplatin-based regimen is recommended. 38,39\n\n【6】 #B. Bladder preservation approach i.\nPatients undergoing a bladder preservation, combined modality approach should be followed in similar fashion to patients treated with a surgical approach, with the addition of regular, lifelong cystoscopic surveillance as per the following schedule: a. Cystoscopy +/-biopsy and cytology q3 months for first 2 years, then every 6 months for the next 2 years, then annually thereafter. ii. Superficial recurrences of bladder cancer may be treated as per other non-muscleinvasive bladder cancers  or with salvage cystectomy with bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy. iii. Muscle-invasive recurrences are recommended to be treated with salvage cystectomy and bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy .\n\n【7】 #Special situations\nA. Non-urothelial histology i. All pathology reported to have variant histology should be reviewed by an expert GU pathologist.\nii. All patients with pure non-urothelial histology should be discussed in a multidisciplinary setting.\niii. Given that pure non-urothelial histologies are generally less sensitive to chemotherapy, (neo)adjuvant treatment is generally not recommended. The major exceptions to this are small cell carcinoma  and micropapillary histology.\niv. Radical cystectomy is strongly preferred over bladder-preserving, combined modality approaches for pure non-urothelial histologies. B. Urachal adenocarcinomas i. Partial cystectomy may be considered as an alternative to radical cystectomy, provided that adequate margins can be maintained.\nii. Cystectomy should be performed with en bloc resection of the urachal ligament and umbilicus. Bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy should also be performed.\niii. As with other non-urothelial histologies, neoadjuvant chemotherapy and bladderpreserving, combined modality approaches are not recommended. iv. It is recommended that these patients are discussed at multidisciplinary rounds postoperatively and are referred to medical oncology for consideration of adjuvant chemotherapy, though there is no level I evidence to support the use of adjuvant chemotherapy. C. Small cell carcinoma of the bladder i. Small cell carcinoma (including any percentage small cell histology, and early stage (i.e T1) disease) of the bladder is recommended to be managed as follows: a All patients should be discussed in multidisciplinary rounds. Treatment recommendations include neoadjuvant chemotherapy with platinum etoposide followed by definitive surgical resection or combined modality therapy analogous to pulmonary small cell carcinoma. 42,43 b For patients who did not receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to definitive local therapy, adjuvant chemotherapy with 4 cycles of platinum-etoposide is recommended. c Baseline staging brain imaging can be considered in asymptomatic patients given the higher risk of brain metastases versus conventional urothelial bladder cancer. It is recommended in patients with higher-risk disease (e.g. T3+, N+ or M+).\nd The role of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) following definitive therapy is unclear. In the absence of data demonstrating clear benefit, PCI is generally not recommended in this setting. e For patients who develop metastatic disease, guidelines for management of metastatic small cell carcinoma of the lung should be followed.\n\n【8】 #Discussion\nFor muscle-invasive bladder cancer (T2-T4a, N0-1, M0), therapy with curative intent typically includes either a radical cystectomy with full bilateral pelvic LN dissection, followed by urinary diversion or neobladder reconstruction  or a bladder preservation approach (i.e. complete tumour resection followed by radiotherapy and concurrent chemotherapy).  There are no modern-era randomized trials to support one approach over the other; however, some patients (e.g. those with adequate renal function, no hydronephrosis, urothelial histology, T2 tumour <5 cm, no CIS, pT0 after a second TURBT, and with a proper bladder capacity and function) 44 may be better suited for bladder preservation while others (i.e. not meeting criteria above) are better suited for radical cystectomy. For patients unable to tolerate or unwilling to undergo either approach, options include: TURBT ± radiotherapy or chemotherapy, TURBT alone, radiotherapy alone, or chemotherapy alone.\nPelvic LN dissection should include the presacral and common iliac lymph nodes to the aortic bifurcation (i.e. extended template). There are data to show that the lymph node metastasis detection rate is higher with extended template pelvic LN dissection than with limited or standard pelvic LN dissection: Heidenreich, et. al. reported 27% detection for extended vs. 12% for standard; 27 Bader, et. al. reported 24% for extended; 28 Allaf, et. al. reported 3% for extended vs. 1% for limited; 29 and Dhar, et. al. reported 26% for extended vs. 13% for limited. 30 The 5-year recurrence-free survival rate for extended is higher than that of limited (71% vs. 63% for pT2pN0-2 and 49% vs. 19% for pT3pN0-2; p<.0001). 30 These results were confirmed in a meta-analysis of 2,824 patients which showed a significantly better recurrence-free survival in extended pelvic LN dissection vs. non-extended pelvic LN dissection (HR 0.65; p<.001). 45 In patients for whom the surgical approach is appropriate, and who are eligible for cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy, the option of neoadjuvant chemotherapy should be discussed; if chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting is deemed inappropriate, adjuvant administration should instead be considered .\nIn patients for whom the bladder-preserving approach is recommended, TURBT should be performed prior to the initiation of concurrent chemoradiation. A prospective study among patients with urothelial carcinoma (T2-T3, Nx, M0; n=33) who underwent maximum TURBT followed by three cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy (e.g. methotrexate, vinblastine, adriamycin and cisplatin; MVAC), followed by radical radiotherapy, demonstrated a response rate of 46.4% overall (39.3% complete; 7.1% partial) and disease free and overall survival rates of 39.3% and 64.3%, respectively, after 12 months of follow-up. Response and survival were positively associated with a lower tumour stage (P=.001) and completeness of TURBT (P=.001). 46 Similar results were reported in another study among patients with T2-T4 bladder cancer (n=74) who underwent either: three cycles of neoadjuvant methotrexate, cisplatin, and vinblastine (MCV) chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy (60 Gy) or concurrent chemoradiotherapy (64.8 Gy with weekly cisplatin). With a mean follow-up of 54 months, the actuarial 5-year overall survival and overall survival with bladder preservation rates were 72% and 60%, respectively; there were no significant differences in the incidence of superficial, muscle-invasive, or distant recurrences. 47 In patients (n=123) with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (T2-T4a), the addition of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (two cycles) with methotrexate, cisplatin, and vinblastine did not improve overall survival or distant metastases rates, as compared to pelvic irradiation (39.6 Gy) with concurrent cisplatin (two cycles q three weeks) alone. The actuarial 5-year overall survival rate was 48% for patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy (versus 49% for those who didn't); the 5-year distant metastasis rate was 33% for those who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (versus 39% for those who didn't). 21 Salvage cystectomy should be performed in patients with invasive residual disease or recurrence. 48,49 A multicenter, phase III trial among patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (N=360) compared radiotherapy alone to radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil; 500 mg/m 2 during fractions 1-5 and 16-20 and mitomycin-C; 12 mg/m 2 on day 1). Two-year locoregional disease-free survival was 67% (95% CI 59-74) for chemoradiotherapy and 54% (95% CI 46-62) for radiotherapy alone. Five-year overall survival was 48% (95% CI 40-55) for chemoradiotherapy and 35% (95% CI 28-43) for radiotherapy alone (p=0.16). 37 A recent randomized controlled trial compared post-TURBT (maximal) whole-pelvis concurrent chemoradiotherapy with bladder-only concurrent chemoradiotherapy (45 Gy in 25 fractions plus 20 Gy boost, with weekly cisplatin 40 mg/m 2 ), among patients with muscle-invasive, node-negative disease (n=230). The 5-year disease-free survival rates (47.1% vs. 46.9%; p=.5), 5-year overall survival rates (52.9% vs. 51.0%; p=.8), and bladder preservation rates (58.9% vs. 57.1%; p=.8) were not different between groups. 13 These data suggest that bladder-only concurrent chemoradiotherapy may be an option for patients with potentially lower morbidity than whole-pelvis chemoradiotherapy.\nNeoadjuvant chemotherapy is cisplatinum-based combination therapy (e.g. cisplatin-gemcitabine or dose-dense MVAC).\nA trial among stage T2-T4a, N0 patients (n=307) who were treated with radical cystectomy alone or preceded by three cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (e.g. methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin) showed that median survival was increased among patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (77 vs. 46 months; P=.06); furthermore, the presence of residual disease was decreased significantly (15 vs. 38%; P<.001) among those who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. 32 Another study in patients with T2-T4aNXM0 disease (n=309) showed that neoadjuvant chemotherapy with three courses of cisplatin and methotrexate also increased overall survival (53 vs. 46%) at a median follow-up of 5.3 years. 50 However, given that both cisplatingemcitabine and dose-dense MVAC have been shown to have improved tolerability with similar outcomes as compared to conventional MVAC in the advanced/metastatic setting for urothelial cancer, 51,52 these regimens have been adopted as standard of care neoadjuvant regimens, despite the lack of level I evidence. Though there are no randomized trials comparing these chemotherapy regimens in the neoadjuvant setting, retrospective studies have not identified a substantial difference between regimens. 53,54 In addition, there are 2 single-arm phase II studies of ddMVAC which suggest this regimen is feasible and effective, with pathologic downstaging to non-muscle invasive disease in 49%-52% of patients. 19,20 In summary, it is currently recommended that neoadjuvant chemotherapy consist of either 4 cycles of cisplatin-gemcitabine or 4 cycles of ddMVAC.\nA meta-analysis of over 3000 T2-T4a patients in whom definitive therapy (surgery or radiotherapy) was given either by itself or with neoadjuvant chemotherapy demonstrated a survival advantage for neoadjuvant treatment. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy, regardless of the type of local treatment that followed, resulted in a 14% reduction in the risk of death and 5% absolute increase in overall survival at five years. 33 Patients with contraindications to cisplatinum should proceed directly to definitive therapy, as the use of carboplatinum-based neoadjuvant combinations is not advised. 32,33, Pure non-urothelial histologies are generally less sensitive to chemotherapy and therefore neoadjuvant chemotherapy is generally avoided in this patient population. The major exception to this is micropapillary bladder cancer, which should be treated similarly to urothelial bladder cancer in terms of perioperative chemotherapy.\nA CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis should precede cystectomy. In patients who have already undergone cystectomy, adjuvant cisplatinum-based combination chemotherapy (using the same regimens as outlined for neoadjuvant chemotherapy above) should be offered. In cases where a cystectomy has already been performed, there is less rigorous evidence for adjuvant chemotherapy.\n\n【9】 TNM staging of Bladder Cancer (AJCC/UICC TNM classification of malignant tumours, 8 th edition) 72 Primary Tumour (T) TX Primary tumour cannot be assessed T0\nNo evidence of primary tumour Ta Non-invasive papillary carcinoma Tis Urothelial carcinoma in situ: \"Flat tumor\" T1 Tumour invades lamina propria (subepithelial connective tissue) T2\nTumour invades muscularis propria pT2a", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

The normal diameter of an aorta depends on the patient's age, sex, height, weight, race, body surface area, and baseline blood pressure.  On average, the normal diameter of the infrarenal aorta is 2 cm, and therefore a true AAA measures 3.0 cm or more.  Aortic ectasia is a mild generalized dilatation (<50% of the normal diameter of ≤ 2.9 cm) that is due to age-related degenerative changes in the vessel walls.\n\n【2】 #Historical Perspective\nThe etymology of the word aneurysm comes from the Greek word for \"dilatation\".  Abdominal aortic aneurysm as a medical condition has been recognized since ancient times, but was not been successfully treated until the early part of the 20th century.  In 1923, Rudolph Matas (who also proposed the concept of endoaneurysmorrhaphy), performed the first successful aortic ligation on a human.  In 1949, Albert Einstein was operated on by Rudolf Nissen by wrapping the aorta with polyethene cellophane, which induced fibrosis and restricted the growth of the aneurysm.  In 1951, Charles Dubost performed the first AAA repair using a homograft. In 1953, Blakemore and Voorhees repaired a ruptured AAA using a Vinyon-N graft (nylon).  In 1962, Javid and Creech reported the technique of endoaneurysmorrhaphy. In 1980, Parodi et al described an endovascular repair.\n\n【3】 #Definition\nThe normal diameter of one's aorta depends on the patient's age, sex, height, weight, race, body surface area, and baseline blood pressure.  On average, the normal diameter of the infrarenal aorta (where abdominal aortic aneurysms are located) is 2 cm.  Therefore an abdominal aortic aneurysm is defined as a dilation of 3.0 cm or more.\nAn abdominal aortic aneurysm is to be distinguished from aortic ectasia which is defined as a mild generalized dilatation (<50% of the normal diameter of ≤ 2.9 cm) that is due to age-related degenerative changes in vessel wall.\n\n【4】 #Anatomy\nThe aorta below the renal arteries, also known as the infrarenal aorta, is the location of 90% of  abdominal aortic aneurysms.  Other possible locations are suprarenal and pararenal.  The aneurysm can extend to include one or both of the iliac arteries.\n\n【5】 #Classification\nAneurysms are usually classified by their shape:\n\n【6】 ## Fusiform Aneurysms\nMost common type seen in the infrarenal aorta and are diffuse and circumferential.\n\n【7】 ## Saccular Aneurysms\nInvolve only a portion of the circumference, with a characteristic outpouching of the vessel wall.\n\n【8】 #Pathophysiology\nThe underlying pathophysiology of abdominal aortic aneurysm involves genetic influences, smoking, hypertension, hemodynamic influences and underlying atherosclerosis.  In rare instances infection, arteritis, and connective tissue disorders may play a role.\n\n【9】 #Causes\nThe most common cause of an AAA is atherosclerosis.\n\n【10】 #Differentiating Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm from other Diseases\nAn abdominal aortic aneurysm should be differentiated from other causes of abdominal pain such as acute cholecystitis, gastrointestinal bleeding, perforated peptic ulcer, ischemic bowel, nephrolithiasis, pyelonephritis, appendicitis, cholelithiasis, large bowel obstruction, small bowel obstruction, pancreatitis, musculoskeletal pain, myocardial infarction, and urinary tract infection.\n\n【11】 #Epidemiology and Demographics\nAbdominal aortic aneurysm is the 13th leading cause of death in the US.  Abdominal aortic aneurysms are more common in developed countries.  Elderly, caucasian males who are smokers are at higher risk for developing an abdominal aortic aneurysm.\n\n【12】 ### Smoking\nThe most significant modifiable risk factor for the development of an abdominal aortic aneurysm is smoking which increases the risk of aneurysm development 8 fold.\n\n【13】 ### Age\nAdvanced age and family history are the strongest non-modifiable risk factors for the development of an abdominal aortic aneurysm.\n\n【14】 ### Hypercholesterolemia\nHypercholesterolemia and hypertension are risk factors as well.\n\n【15】 ### Caucasian Race\nCaucasian race is associated with a higher incidence of AAA when compared to non Caucasian race.\n\n【16】 ## Expansion\nAn increased rate of expansion of abdominal aortic aneurysm is related to systolic hypertension, wide pulse pressure, and ongoing smoking.\n\n【17】 ## Rupture\nThe risk of abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture is proportional to the size and rate of growth of the aneurysm.  Abdominal aortic aneurysms greater than 5 cm diameter or those that grow faster than 1 cm per year have a significantly increased risk of rupture and are indications for elective operative repair.  Advanced age, female gender, hypertension, active smoking, outpouchings, and mural thrombus are also risk factors for abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture.\n\n【18】 #Screening\nApproximately 16% of large abdominal aortic aneurysms (diameter > 5.5 cm) rupture, causing 9,000 AAA-related deaths in the United States per year.  Several studies have shown that screening can drastically reduce the aneurysm rupture rate by 45-49% for men older than 60, and reduce AAA-related mortality by 21-68%.  In a landmark study randomizing 67,800 men, (The Multicenter Aneurysm Screening Study) aneurysm-related mortality was 53% lower in the screening group as compared with control patients.  The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends one-time screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) by ultrasonography in any man aged 65 to 75 who has ever smoked.  The USPSTF makes no recommendation for or against screening for AAA in men aged 65 to 75 who have never smoked.  The USPSTF recommends against routine screening for AAA in women.\n\n【19】 #Natural History, Complications and Prognosis\nAbdominal aortic aneurysms expand slowly over time.  An aortic aneurysm can progress to a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm, which is a medical emergency associated with an extremely high mortality.  Serious complications can also occur as a result of an aortic dissection, such as myocardial infarction, shock, stroke, kidney failure, and arterial emboli.  A ruptured AAA carries an overall mortality rate approaching 75%, which is much higher than the mortality rate of 2-6% in those patients who underwent elective surgical repair. Approximately 16% of large AAAs (diameter >5.5 cm) rupture, causing 9,000 AAA-related deaths in the United States per year.  Several studies have shown that screening can drastically reduce the aneurysm rupture rate by 45-49% for men older than 60, and reduce AAA-related mortality by 21-68%.  The outcome is usually good if an experienced surgeon repairs the aneurysm before it ruptures. Rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm is associated with a 60% to 90% mortality before the patient reaches a hospital.  It is associated with a 30% to 80% operative mortality among those patients who survive long enough to undergo surgery.\n\n【20】 #History and Symptoms\nGiven that smoking increases the risk of abdominal aortic aneurysm development, a smoking history should be obtained in elderly men.  If a male over the age of 65 has a history of smoking, they should undergo ultrasonography to screen for an abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Abdominal aortic aneurysms are usually asymptomatic until they expand or rupture.  Spontaneous abdominal pain in a patient with a pulsatile epigastric mass or a known AAA may signal rupture into the retroperitoneum or leakage within the aneurysm wall.  If a patient does develop symptoms, the risk of rupture is quite high, which is why symptoms are considered an indication for surgery.  Pain is the most common symptomatic manifestation of AAA.\n\n【21】 #Physical Examination\nPhysical examination has a low sensitivity in the detection of small abdominal aortic aneurysms (29-61% for abdominal aortic aneurysms 3.0-3.9 cm in diameter) but has a sensitivity of 76-82% to detect those abdominal aortic aneurysms that are 5.0 cm or larger that may warrant repair.  It is easier to detect a pulsatile mass in thin patients and those who do not have tense abdomens.  Contrary to popular belief, gentle palpation of abdominal aortic aneurysms is safe, and does not precipitate rupture.\n\n【22】 #Abdominal X Ray\nPlain abdominal radiographs are obtained in patients with abdominal complaints before the diagnosis of AAA has been made.  It is very difficult to evaluate patients with AAA using plain radiographs, because aortic wall calcification is seen in less than half of the cases with AAA.  However, plain radiographs may be helpful when an aneurysmal aorta appears normal on angiogram, due to thrombus within the sac.\n\n【23】 #Abdominal Ultrasound\nAbdominal ultrasound is the standard imaging modality to detect and follow the progression of an abdominal aortic aneurysm.  When performed by an expert, it has a sensitivity and specificity close to 100% and 96%, respectively.  Abdominal ultrasound can also detect mural thrombus, iliac artery aneurysms, and free peritoneal blood.  Patients should fast before examination to optimize image quality.\n\n【24】 #Computed Tomography (CT)\n\n【25】 #Magnetic Resonance Imaging\nMRI might be a better soft tissue visualizer than ultrasonography and CT, but its limitations limit its usage as a screening tool and as a diagnostic tool during emergencies like ruptured AAA.  However its advantages makes it a good alternative in AAA patients with poor renal function and in elective preoperative evaluation of unruptured AAA.\n\n【26】 #Other Imaging Findings\nAngiography is an alternative less often used imaging method for visualization of an abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Angiography is helpful in determining anatomy of aorta precisely.  It can be used preoperatively in case of suspected suprarenal or thoracic aortic aneurysm, femoral or popliteal aneurysm, renal artery stenosis, unexplained renal insufficiency, occlusive ilio-femoral disease, or visceral ischemia.\n\n【27】 #Medical Therapy\nRisk factor modification, such as smoking cessation, management of hypertension, and lipid lowering are essential in reducing the risk of development and the rate of progression of abdominal aortic aneurysms.\n\n【28】 #Surgery\nIndications for operative repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm include the presence of symptoms such as back pain, the presence of a rupture or contained rupture, an abdominal aortic aneurysm diameter greater than 5.5 cm, a rate of expansion of greater than 1 cm in one year, and an inflammatory or infectious etiology.  Open surgical repair is favored in young patients as an elective procedure, the presence of an expanding aneurysm, symptomatic aneurysm, or ruptured aneurysm.  An endovascular repair (EVAR) is favored in older patients and high risk patients or those unfit for open repair.  Risk factors for postoperative morbidity and mortality include extensive atheromatous disease, mural calcification, thrombosis, juxtarenal extension of the aneurysm and the presence of inflammatory changes.\n\n【29】 #Prevention\nSmoking cessation and blood pressure management are two strategies to reverse modifiable risk factors for the development, progression, and rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

The recommendations apply to bipolar I, bipolar II, mixed affective and rapid cycling disorders. It aims to improve access to treatment and quality of life in people with bipolar disorder.\n\n【2】 #Introduction\nBipolar disorder is a potentially lifelong and disabling condition characterised by episodes of mania (abnormally elevated mood or irritability and related symptoms with severe functional impairment or psychotic symptoms for 7 days or more) or hypomania (abnormally elevated mood or irritability and related symptoms with decreased or increased function for 4 days or more) and episodes of depressed mood. It is often comorbid with other disorders such as anxiety disorders, substance misuse, personality disorders and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).\nThe peak age of onset is 15 to 19 years, and there is often a substantial delay between onset and first contact with mental health services. The lifetime prevalence of bipolar I disorder (mania and depression) is estimated at 1% of the adult population, and bipolar II disorder (hypomania and depression) affects approximately 0.4% of adults. Bipolar disorder in children under 12 years is very rare.\nSince the publication of the previous NICE guideline (CG38) in 2006, there have been some important advances in our knowledge of the care pathway and treatment approaches that are most likely to benefit people with bipolar disorder. All areas of CG38 have been updated.\nThis guideline covers the recognition, assessment and management of bipolar disorder in children, young people and adults. It includes specific recommendations for diagnosis in children and young people because presentation in these age groups can be complicated by other conditions such as ADHD. The recommendations apply to people with bipolar I, bipolar II, mixed affective and rapid cycling disorders. Non‑bipolar affective disorders are not covered because these are addressed by other guidelines, and this guideline does not make specific recommendations about other mental disorders that commonly coexist with bipolar disorder.\n\n【3】 #Safeguarding children\nRemember that child maltreatment:\nis common can present anywhere, such as emergency departments, primary and secondary care and community settings (such as the child's home).\nBe aware of or suspect abuse as a contributory factor to or cause of bipolar disorder in children. Abuse may also coexist with bipolar disorder.  NICE's guideline on child maltreatment for clinical features that may be associated with maltreatment.\n#Recommendations\nPeople have the right to be involved in discussions and make informed decisions about their care, as described in making decisions about your care.\nMaking decisions using NICE guidelines explains how we use words to show the strength (or certainty) of our recommendations, and has information about prescribing medicines (including off-label use), professional guidelines, standards and laws (including on consent and mental capacity), and safeguarding.\nThe recommendations cover children, young people and adults with suspected or diagnosed bipolar disorder and apply to bipolar I, bipolar II, mixed affective and rapid cycling disorders.\n\n【4】 ## Improving the experience of care\nUse this guideline in conjunction with NICE's guideline on service user experience in adult mental health to improve the experience of care for adults with bipolar disorder using mental health services, and for adults, children and young people:\npromote a positive recovery message from the point of diagnosis and throughout care build supportive and empathic relationships as an essential part of care.\nFollow the recommendations in general principles of care in NICE's guideline on psychosis and schizophrenia in children and young people to improve the experience of care for children and young people with bipolar disorder.\n\n【5】 ## Treatment and support for specific populations\nFollow the recommendations in race, culture and ethnicity in NICE's clinical guideline on psychosis and schizophrenia in adults when working with people with bipolar disorder from black, Asian and minority ethnic groups.\nNICE's guideline on antenatal and postnatal mental health for guidance on the management of bipolar disorder during pregnancy and the postnatal period and in women and girls of childbearing potential.\nEnsure that people with bipolar disorder and a coexisting learning disability are offered the same range of treatments and services as other people with bipolar disorder.\nOffer people with bipolar disorder and coexisting disorders, such as personality disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety disorders or substance misuse, treatment in line with the relevant NICE guideline, in addition to their treatment for bipolar disorder.  NICE's guidelines on antisocial personality disorder, borderline personality disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, generalised anxiety disorder and psychosis with coexisting substance misuse, be alert to the potential for drug interactions and use clinical judgement.\nOffer people with rapid cycling bipolar disorder the same interventions as people with other types of bipolar disorder because there is currently no strong evidence to suggest that people with rapid cycling bipolar disorder should be treated differently.\n\n【6】 ## Information and support\nConsider identifying and offering assistance with education, financial and employment problems that may result from the behaviour associated with bipolar disorder, such as mania and hypomania. If the person with bipolar disorder agrees, this could include talking directly with education staff, creditors and employers about bipolar disorder and its possible effects, and how the person can be supported.\nEncourage people with bipolar disorder to develop advance statements while their condition is stable, in collaboration with their carers if possible.\nExplain and discuss making a lasting power of attorney with adults with bipolar disorder and their carers if there are financial problems resulting from mania or hypomania.\n\n【7】 ## Support for carers of people with bipolar disorder\nOffer carers of people with bipolar disorder an assessment (provided by mental health services) of their own needs and discuss with them their strengths and views. Develop a care plan to address any identified needs, give a copy to the carer and their GP and ensure it is reviewed annually.\nAdvise carers about their statutory right to a formal carer's assessment provided by social care services and explain how to access this.  NICE's guideline on supporting adult carers.\nGive carers written and verbal information in an accessible format about:\ndiagnosis and management of bipolar disorder positive outcomes and recovery types of support for carers role of teams and services getting help in a crisis. When providing information, offer the carer support if necessary.\nAs early as possible negotiate with the person with bipolar disorder and their carers about how information about the person will be shared. When discussing rights to confidentiality, emphasise the importance of sharing information about risks and the need for carers to understand the person's perspective. Foster a collaborative approach that supports both people with bipolar disorder and their carers, and respects their individual needs and interdependence.\nReview regularly how information is shared, especially if there are communication and collaboration difficulties between the person and their carer.\nInclude carers in decision‑making if the person agrees.\nOffer a carer‑focused education and support programme, which may be part of a family intervention for bipolar disorder, as early as possible to all carers. The intervention should:\nbe available as needed have a positive message about recovery.\nIdentify children, young people and adults at risk of abuse or neglect who are dependent on, living with or caring for a person with bipolar disorder and:\nreview the need for an assessment according to local safeguarding procedures for children or adults as appropriate\n-ffer psychological and social support as needed.\n\n【8】 ## Recognising bipolar disorder in primary care and referral\nWhen adults present in primary care with depression, ask about previous periods of overactivity or disinhibited behaviour. If the overactivity or disinhibited behaviour lasted for 4 days or more, consider referral for a specialist mental health assessment.\nRefer people urgently for a specialist mental health assessment if mania or severe depression is suspected or they are a danger to themselves or others.\nDo not use questionnaires in primary care to identify bipolar disorder in adults.\n\n【9】 ## Managing bipolar disorder in primary care\nDecember 2022: The MHRA has issued new safety advice on risks associated with valproate for anyone under 55.\nWhen working with people with bipolar disorder in primary care:\nengage with and develop an ongoing relationship with them and their carers support them to carry out care plans developed in secondary care and achieve their recovery goals follow crisis plans developed in secondary care and liaise with secondary care specialists if necessary review their treatment and care, including medication, at least annually and more often if the person, carer or healthcare professional has any concerns.\nOffer people with bipolar depression:\na psychological intervention that has been developed specifically for bipolar disorder and has a published evidence-based manual describing how it should be delivered or a choice of psychological intervention (cognitive behavioural therapy, interpersonal therapy or behavioural couples therapy) in line with the advice on treatment options for more severe depression in the NICE guideline on depression.Discuss with the person the possible benefits and risks of psychological interventions and their preference. Monitor mood and if there are signs of hypomania or deterioration of the depressive symptoms, liaise with or refer the person to secondary care. If the person develops mania or severe depression, refer them urgently to secondary care.\nPsychological therapists working with people with bipolar depression in primary care should have training in and experience of working with people with bipolar disorder.\nDo not start lithium to treat bipolar disorder in primary care for people who have not taken lithium before, except under shared‑care arrangements.\nDo not start valproate in primary care to treat bipolar disorder.\n\n【10】 there is a poor or partial response to treatment the person's functioning declines significantly treatment adherence is poor the person develops intolerable or medically important side effects from medication comorbid alcohol or drug misuse is suspected a woman with bipolar disorder is pregnant or planning a pregnancy.\n\n【11】 ## Physical health\nDevelop and use practice case registers to monitor the physical and mental health of people with bipolar disorder in primary care.\nMonitor the physical health of people with bipolar disorder when responsibility for monitoring is transferred from secondary care, and then at least annually. The health check should be comprehensive, including all the checks recommended in recommendation 1.2.12 and focusing on physical health problems such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity and respiratory disease. A copy of the results should be sent to the care coordinator and psychiatrist, and put in the secondary care records.\nEnsure that the physical health check for people with bipolar disorder, performed at least annually, includes:\nweight or BMI, diet, nutritional status and level of physical activity cardiovascular status, including pulse and blood pressure metabolic status, including fasting blood glucose or glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c), and blood lipid profile liver function renal and thyroid function, and calcium levels, for people taking long‑term lithium.\nIdentify people with bipolar disorder who have hypertension, have abnormal lipid levels, are obese or at risk of obesity, have diabetes or are at risk of diabetes (as indicated by abnormal blood glucose levels), or are physically inactive, at the earliest opportunity. Follow NICE's guidelines on hypertension, lipid modification, prevention of cardiovascular disease, obesity, physical activity and preventing type 2 diabetes.\nOffer treatment to people with bipolar disorder who have diabetes and/or cardiovascular disease in primary care in line with NICE's guidelines on type 1 diabetes in adults: diagnosis and management, type 2 diabetes in adults: management and lipid modification.\n\n【12】 #Assessing suspected bipolar disorder in adults in secondary care\nAssessment of suspected bipolar disorder, and subsequent management, should be conducted in a service that can:\n-ffer the full range of pharmacological, psychological, social, occupational and educational interventions for people with bipolar disorder consistent with this guideline be competent to provide all interventions offered place emphasis on engagement as well as risk management provide treatment and care in the least restrictive and stigmatising environment possible, and in an atmosphere of hope and optimism in line with NICE's guideline on service user experience in adult mental health. This might be an early intervention in psychosis service, a specialist bipolar disorder team, or a specialist integrated community‑based team.\nWhen assessing suspected bipolar disorder:\n\n【13】 assess social and personal functioning and current psychosocial stressors assess the person's physical health and review medication and side effects, including weight gain discuss treatment history and identify interventions that have been effective or ineffective in the past encourage people to invite a family member or carer to give a corroborative history discuss possible factors associated with changes in mood, including relationships, psychosocial factors and lifestyle changes identify personal recovery goals.\nTake into account the possibility of differential diagnoses including schizophrenia spectrum disorders, personality disorders, drug misuse, alcohol‑use disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and underlying physical disorders such as hypo‑ or hyperthyroidism.\nIf bipolar disorder is diagnosed, develop a care plan in collaboration with the person with bipolar disorder based on the assessment carried out in recommendation 1.3.2 as soon as possible after assessment and, depending on their needs, using the care programme approach. Give the person and their GP a copy of the plan, and encourage the person to share it with their carers.\nCarry out a risk assessment in conjunction with the person with bipolar disorder, and their carer if possible, focusing on areas that are likely to present possible danger or harm, such as self‑neglect, self‑harm, suicidal thoughts and intent, risks to others, including family members, driving, spending money excessively, financial or sexual exploitation, disruption in family and love relationships, disinhibited and sexualised behaviour, and risks of sexually transmitted diseases4.\n\n【14】 #Managing crisis, risk and behaviour that challenges in adults with bipolar disorder in secondary care\n\n【15】 identifiable personal, social, occupational, or environmental triggers and early warning signs and symptoms of relapse a protocol for applying the person's own coping strategies and increasing doses of medication or taking additional medication (which may be given to the person in advance) for people at risk of onset of mania or for whom early warning signs and symptoms can be identified agreements between primary and secondary care about how to respond to an increase in risk or concern about possible risk information about who to contact if the person with bipolar disorder and, if appropriate, their carer, is concerned or in a crisis, including the names of healthcare professionals in primary and secondary care who can be contacted.Give the person and their GP a copy of the plan, and encourage the person to share it with their carers.\n\n【16】 If people with bipolar disorder pose an immediate risk to themselves or others during an acute episode, see:\nNICE's guideline on violence and aggression: short-term management in mental health, health and community settings and service user experience in adult mental health for advice on managing agitation, challenging behaviour and imminent violence, and on rapid tranquillisation or\nNICE's guideline on self-harm for advice on managing acts of self‑harm and suicide risk.\n\n【17】 ## Support and advice\nEnsure that people with mania or hypomania have access to calming environments and reduced stimulation. Advise them not to make important decisions until they have recovered from mania or hypomania and encourage them to maintain their relationships with their carers if possible.\n\n【18】 ## Pharmacological interventions\nDecember 2022: The MHRA has issued new safety advice on risks associated with valproate for anyone under 55.\nIf a person develops mania or hypomania and is taking an antidepressant (as defined by the British National Formulary ) as monotherapy:\nconsider stopping the antidepressant and -ffer an antipsychotic as set out in recommendation 1.5.3, regardless of whether the antidepressant is stopped.\nIf a person develops mania or hypomania and is not taking an antipsychotic or mood stabiliser, offer haloperidol, olanzapine, quetiapine or risperidone, taking into account any advance statements, the person's preference and clinical context (including physical comorbidity, previous response to treatment and side effects)10.\nIf an alternative antipsychotic is not sufficiently effective at the maximum licensed dose, consider adding lithium. If adding lithium is ineffective, or if lithium is not suitable (for example, because the person does not agree to routine blood monitoring), consider adding valproate instead. Do not offer valproate to women or girls of childbearing potential (including young girls who are likely to need treatment into their childbearing years) for long-term treatment or to treat an acute episode, unless other options are ineffective or not tolerated and the pregnancy prevention programme is in place. Follow the MHRA safety advice on valproate use by women and girls. Although its use is common in UK clinical practice, in September 2014 this was an off-label use of lithium.  NICE's information on prescribing medicines. In September 2014 semi-sodium valproate had a UK marketing authorisation for the treatment of mania if lithium is not tolerated or is contraindicated; this was an off-label use of sodium valproate, although its use was common in UK clinical practice.  NICE's information on prescribing medicines.  update information for important safety advice from the MHRA on the use of valproate.\nIf the person is already taking lithium, check plasma lithium levels to optimise treatment . Consider adding haloperidol, olanzapine, quetiapine or risperidone, depending on the person's preference and previous response to treatment.\nIf the person is already taking valproate or another mood stabiliser as prophylactic treatment, consider increasing the dose, up to the maximum level in the BNF if necessary, depending on clinical response. If there is no improvement, consider adding haloperidol, olanzapine, quetiapine or risperidone, depending on the person's preference and previous response to treatment10.If a woman or girl of childbearing potential is already taking valproate, advise her to gradually stop the drug because of the risk of fetal malformations and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes after any exposure in pregnancy.  the MHRA safety advice on valproate use by women and girls.\nDo not offer lamotrigine to treat mania.\n\n【19】 ## Electroconvulsive therapy\nFor the treatment of severe mania that has not responded to other interventions, see NICE's technology appraisal guidance on the use of electroconvulsive therapy.\n\n【20】 ## Reviewing treatment for mania\nWithin 4 weeks of resolution of symptoms, discuss with the person, and their carers if appropriate, whether to continue treatment for mania or start long‑term treatment . Explain the potential benefits of long‑term treatment and the risks, including side effects of medication used for long‑term treatment.\nIf the person decides to continue treatment for mania, offer it for a further 3 to 6 months, and then review.\n\n【21】 ## Psychological interventions\nOffer adults with bipolar depression:\na psychological intervention that has been developed specifically for bipolar disorder and has a published evidence-based manual describing how it should be delivered or a choice of psychological intervention (cognitive behavioural therapy, interpersonal therapy or behavioural couples therapy) in line with the advice on treatment options for more severe depression in the NICE guideline on depression. Discuss with the person the possible benefits and risks of psychological interventions and their preference. Monitor mood for signs of mania or hypomania or deterioration of the depressive symptoms.\nPsychological therapists working with people with bipolar depression should have training in, and experience of, working with people with bipolar disorder.\n\n【22】 ## Pharmacological interventions\nDecember 2022: The MHRA has issued new safety advice on risks associated with valproate for anyone under 55.\nIf a person develops moderate or severe bipolar depression and is not taking a drug to treat their bipolar disorder, offer fluoxetine combined with olanzapine, or quetiapine on its own, depending on the person's preference and previous response to treatment.\nIf the person prefers, consider either olanzapine (without fluoxetine) or lamotrigine on its own.\nIf there is no response to fluoxetine combined with olanzapine, or quetiapine, consider lamotrigine on its own10.In September 2014, this was an off-label use of olanzapine. Although their use was common in UK clinical practice, in September 2014 this was an off-label use of fluoxetine and of lamotrigine.  NICE's information on prescribing medicines.\nIf there is no response to adding fluoxetine combined with olanzapine, or adding quetiapine, stop the additional treatment and consider adding lamotrigine to valproate10 on using valproate, antipsychotics and lamotrigine.If a woman or girl of childbearing potential is already taking valproate, advise her to gradually stop the drug because of the risk of fetal malformations and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes after any exposure in pregnancy.  the MHRA safety advice on valproate use by women and girls.In September 2014 aripiprazole had a UK marketing authorisation for up to 12 weeks of treatment for moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar I disorder in young people aged 13 and older.In September 2014, these were off-label uses of olanzapine, risperidone, haloperidol, quetiapine, lamotrigine, lithium and valproate for children and young people.  NICE's information on prescribing medicines.\n10 and be aware of the potential interactions between valproate and fluoxetine, lamotrigine and olanzapine.  the MHRA safety advice on valproate use by women and girls.\nTake into account toxicity in overdose when prescribing psychotropic medication during periods of high suicide risk. Assess the need to limit the quantity of medication supplied to reduce the risk to life if the person overdoses.\n\n【23】 ## Reviewing treatment for bipolar depression\nWithin 4 weeks of resolution of symptoms, discuss with the person, and their carers if appropriate, whether to continue psychological or pharmacological treatment for bipolar depression or start long‑term treatment . Explain the potential benefits of long‑term treatment and the risks, including side effects of medication used for long‑term treatment.\nIf the person decides to continue psychological or pharmacological treatment for bipolar depression, offer it for a further 3 to 6 months, and then review.\n\n【24】 ## Discussing long‑term treatment\nAfter each episode of mania or bipolar depression, discuss with the person, and their carers if appropriate, managing their bipolar disorder in the longer term. Discussion should aim to help people understand that bipolar disorder is commonly a long‑term relapsing and remitting condition that needs self‑management and engagement with primary and secondary care professionals and involvement of carers. The discussion should cover:\nthe nature and variable course of bipolar disorder the role of psychological and pharmacological interventions to prevent relapse and reduce symptoms the person's history of bipolar disorder, including:\nthe severity and frequency of episodes of mania or bipolar depression, with a focus on associated risks and adverse consequences previous response to treatment symptoms between episodes potential triggers for relapse, early warning signs, and self‑management strategies possible duration of treatment, and when and how often this should be reviewed.Provide clear written information about bipolar disorder, including NICE's information for the public, and ensure there is enough time to discuss options and concerns.\n\n【25】 ## Psychological interventions\nOffer a family intervention to people with bipolar disorder who are living, or in close contact, with their family in line with recommendation 1.3.7.2. in NICE's guideline on psychosis and schizophrenia in adults.\nOffer a structured psychological intervention (individual, group or family), which has been designed for bipolar disorder and has a published evidence-based manual describing how it should be delivered, to prevent relapse or for people who have some persisting symptoms between episodes of mania or bipolar depression.\nIndividual and group psychological interventions for bipolar disorder to prevent relapse should:\nprovide information about bipolar disorder consider the impact of thoughts and behaviour on moods and relapse include self‑monitoring of mood, thoughts and behaviour address relapse risk, distress and how to improve functioning develop plans for relapse management and staying well individual programmes should be tailored to the person's needs based on an individualised assessment and psychological formulation group programmes should include discussion of the information provided with a focus on its relevance for the participants.\n\n【26】 ## Pharmacological interventions\nDecember 2022: The MHRA has issued new safety advice on risks associated with valproate for anyone under 55\nWhen planning long‑term pharmacological treatment to prevent relapse, take into account drugs that have been effective during episodes of mania or bipolar depression,\nOffer lithium as a first‑line, long‑term pharmacological treatment for bipolar disorder and:\nif lithium is ineffective, consider adding valproate if lithium is poorly tolerated, or is not suitable  semi-sodium valproate had a UK marketing authorisation for this indication in people who have had mania that has responded to treatment with semi-sodium valproate; it was an off-label use of sodium valproate, although its use was common in UK clinical practice.  NICE's information on prescribing medicines.  update information for important safety advice from the MHRA on the use of valproate.\nIf stopping long‑term pharmacological treatment:\ndiscuss with the person how to recognise early signs of relapse and what to do if symptoms recur stop treatment gradually  and monitor the person for signs of relapse.\nContinue monitoring symptoms, mood and mental state for 2 years after medication has stopped entirely. This may be undertaken in primary care .\n\n【27】 #Monitoring physical health in secondary care\nHealthcare professionals in secondary care should ensure, as part of the care programme approach, that people with bipolar disorder receive physical healthcare from primary care as described in recommendations 1.2.10 to 1.2.14 after responsibility for monitoring has been transferred from secondary care.\nPeople with bipolar disorder, especially those taking antipsychotics and long‑term medication, should be offered a combined healthy eating and physical activity programme by their mental healthcare provider.\nIf a person has rapid or excessive weight gain, abnormal lipid levels or problems with blood glucose management, take into account the effects of medication, mental state, other physical health and lifestyle factors in the development of these problems and offer interventions in line with NICE's guidelines on obesity, lipid modification or preventing type 2 diabetes.\nRoutinely monitor weight and cardiovascular and metabolic indicators of morbidity in people with bipolar disorder. These should be audited in the annual team report.\nTrusts should ensure that they take account of relevant guidelines on the monitoring and treatment of cardiovascular and metabolic disease in people with bipolar disorder through board‑level performance indicators.\n\n【28】 ## Continuing treatment in secondary care\nContinue treatment and care in an early intervention in psychosis service, a specialist bipolar disorder service or a specialist integrated community‑based team.8.\nConsider intensive case management for people with bipolar disorder who are likely to disengage from treatment or services.\n\n【29】 ## Return to primary care\nOffer people with bipolar disorder whose symptoms have responded effectively to treatment and remain stable the option to return to primary care for further management. If they wish to do this, record it in their notes and coordinate transfer of responsibilities through the care programme approach.\nWhen making transfer arrangements for a return to primary care, agree a care plan with the person, which includes:\nclear, individualised social and emotional recovery goals a crisis plan indicating early warning symptoms and triggers of both mania and depression relapse and preferred response during relapse, including liaison and referral pathways an assessment of the person's mental state a medication plan with a date for review by primary care, frequency and nature of monitoring for effectiveness and adverse effects, and what should happen in the event of a relapse.Give the person and their GP a copy of the plan, and encourage the person to share it with their carers.\nEncourage and support the person to visit their GP and discuss the care plan before discharge and transfer.\n\n【30】 ## Employment, education and occupational activities\nOffer supported employment programmes to people with bipolar disorder in primary or secondary care who wish to find or return to work. Consider other occupational or educational activities, including pre‑vocational training, for people who are unable to work or unsuccessful in finding employment.\n\n【31】 #How to use medication\nWhen using any psychotropic medication for bipolar disorder ensure that:\nthe person is given information that is suitable for their developmental level about the purpose and likely side effects of treatment including any monitoring that is required, and give them an opportunity to ask questions the overall medication regimen is regularly reviewed so that drugs that are not needed after the acute episode are stopped.\nDiscuss the use of alcohol, tobacco, prescription and non‑prescription medication and illicit drugs with the person, and their carer if appropriate. Explain the possible interference of these substances with the therapeutic effects of prescribed medication and psychological interventions.\nuse medication at lower doses take into account the increased risk of drug interactions take into account the negative impact that anticholinergic medication, or drugs with anticholinergic activity, can have on cognitive function and mobility ensure that medical comorbidities have been recognised and treated.\nDo not offer gabapentin or topiramate to treat bipolar disorder.\n\n【32】 ## Using antipsychotic medication\nBefore starting antipsychotic medication, measure and record the person's:\nweight or BMI\npulse blood pressure fasting blood glucose or HbA1c blood lipid profile.\nit is specified in the drug's summary of product characteristics (SPC) or a physical examination has identified a specific cardiovascular risk (such as hypertension) or there is a family history of cardiovascular disease, a history of sudden collapse, or other cardiovascular risk factors such as cardiac arrhythmia or the person is being admitted as an inpatient.\nTreatment with antipsychotic medication should be considered an explicit individual therapeutic trial. Carry out the following:\nDiscuss and record the side effects that the person is most willing to tolerate.\nRecord the indications and expected benefits and risks of antipsychotic medication, and the expected time for a change in symptoms and appearance of side effects.\nAt the start of treatment prescribe a dose that is appropriate for the phase and severity of the illness.\nDo not routinely prescribe a dose above the maximum recommended in the BNF or SPC.\nJustify and record reasons for doses outside the range given in the BNF or SPC, and inform the person that such treatment is unlicensed.\nRecord the rationale for continuing, changing or stopping medication, and the effects of such changes.\nMonitor and record the following during dose titration and then regularly and systematically throughout treatment:\nresponse to treatment, including changes in symptoms and behaviour side effects and their impact on physical health and functioning the emergence of movement disorders adherence.\nThe secondary care team should maintain responsibility for monitoring the efficacy and tolerability of antipsychotic medication for at least the first 12 months or until the person's condition has stabilised, whichever is longer. Thereafter, the responsibility for this monitoring may be transferred to primary care under shared‑care arrangements.\nIf out‑of‑range test results are reported at any stage of treatment, the healthcare professional who ordered the tests should ensure that the person is offered further investigations and treatment as needed.\n'As required' (p.r.n.) prescriptions of antipsychotic medication should be made as described in recommendation 1.10.7. Review clinical indications, frequency of administration, therapeutic benefits and side effects each week or more often if needed. Ensure that p.r.n. prescriptions have not unintentionally led to a total antipsychotic dosage above the maximum specified in the BNF or SPC.\nDo not start regular combined antipsychotic medication, except for short periods (for example, when changing medication).\nIf stopping an antipsychotic drug, reduce the dose gradually over at least 4 weeks to minimise the risk of relapse.\n\n【33】 ## Using lithium\nWhen starting lithium:\nadvise the person that poor adherence or rapid discontinuation may increase the risk of relapse measure the person's weight or BMI and arrange tests for urea and electrolytes including calcium, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), thyroid function and a full blood count arrange an ECG for people with cardiovascular disease or risk factors for it ensure the person is given appropriate national information (or a locally available equivalent) on taking lithium safely establish a shared‑care arrangement with the person's GP for prescribing lithium and monitoring adverse effects.\nMeasure plasma lithium levels 1 week after starting lithium and 1 week after every dose change, and weekly until the levels are stable. Aim to maintain plasma lithium level between 0.6 and 0.8 mmol per litre in people being prescribed lithium for the first time.\nConsider maintaining plasma lithium levels at 0.8 to 1.0 mmol per litre for a trial period of at least 6 months for people who:\nhave had a relapse while taking lithium in the past or are taking lithium and have subthreshold symptoms with functional impairment.\nAdvise people taking lithium to:\nseek medical attention if they develop diarrhoea or vomiting or become acutely ill for any reason ensure they maintain their fluid intake, particularly after sweating (for example, after exercise, in hot climates or if they have a fever), if they are immobile for long periods or if they develop a chest infection or pneumonia talk to their doctor as soon as possible if they become pregnant or are planning a pregnancy.\nWarn people taking lithium not to take over‑the‑counter non‑steroidal anti‑inflammatory drugs and avoid prescribing these drugs for people with bipolar disorder if possible; if they are prescribed, this should be on a regular (not p.r.n.) basis and the person should be monitored monthly until a stable lithium level is reached and then every 3 months.\nMeasure the person's plasma lithium level every 3 months for the first year.\nAfter the first year, measure plasma lithium levels every 6 months, or every 3 months for people in any of the following groups:\n-lder people people taking drugs that interact with lithium people who are at risk of impaired renal or thyroid function, raised calcium levels or other complications people who have poor symptom control people whose last plasma lithium level was 0.8 mmol per litre or higher.\nMeasure the person's weight or BMI and arrange tests for urea and electrolytes including calcium, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and thyroid function every 6 months, and more often if there is evidence of impaired renal or thyroid function, raised calcium levels or an increase in mood symptoms that might be related to impaired thyroid function.\nMonitor lithium dose and plasma lithium levels more frequently if urea levels and creatinine levels become elevated, or eGFR falls over 2 or more tests, and assess the rate of deterioration of renal function. For further information see NICE's guidelines on chronic kidney disease and acute kidney injury.\nWhen discussing whether to continue lithium, take into account clinical efficacy, other risk factors for renal impairment and cardiovascular disease, and degree of renal impairment; if needed seek advice from a renal specialist and a clinician with expertise in managing bipolar disorder.\nMonitor the person at every appointment for symptoms of neurotoxicity, including paraesthesia, ataxia, tremor and cognitive impairment, which can occur at therapeutic levels of lithium.\nIf stopping lithium, reduce the dose gradually over at least 4 weeks, and preferably up to 3 months, even if the person has started taking another antimanic drug.\nDuring dose reduction and for 3 months after lithium treatment is stopped, monitor the person closely for early signs of mania and depression.\n\n【34】 ## Using valproate\nDecember 2022: The MHRA has issued new safety advice on risks associated with valproate for anyone under 55.\nDo not offer valproate to women or girls of childbearing potential (including young girls who are likely to need treatment into their childbearing years) for long‑term treatment or to treat an acute episode, unless other options are ineffective or not tolerated and the pregnancy prevention programme is in place.  MHRA safety advice on valproate use by women and girls.\nIf a woman or girl of childbearing potential is already taking valproate, advise her to gradually stop the drug because of the risk of fetal malformations and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes after any exposure in pregnancy.  the MHRA safety advice on valproate use by women and girls.\nWhen starting valproate, measure the person's weight or BMI and carry out a full blood count and liver function tests. Do not offer valproate to women and girls of childbearing age (including young girls who are likely to need treatment into their childbearing years) unless other options are ineffective or not tolerated and the pregnancy prevention programme is in place.  the MHRA safety advice on valproate use by women and girls.\nAdvise people taking valproate, and their carers, how to recognise the signs and symptoms of blood and liver disorders and to seek immediate medical help if any of these develop. Stop valproate immediately if abnormal liver function or blood dyscrasia is detected.Although the absolute values of hepatic enzymes are a poor indicator of the extent of hepatic damage, it is generally accepted that if these are persistently elevated to over 3 times the upper normal limit, continuing to rise or accompanied by clinical symptoms, the suspected drug should be withdrawn. Raised hepatic enzymes of any magnitude accompanied by reduced albumin or impaired clotting suggest severe liver disease.\nWhen prescribing valproate, be aware of its interactions with other anticonvulsants (particularly carbamazepine and lamotrigine) and with olanzapine and smoking.\nDo not routinely measure plasma valproate levels unless there is evidence of ineffectiveness, poor adherence or toxicity.\nMeasure the person's weight or BMI and carry out liver function tests and a full blood count again after 6 months of treatment with valproate and repeat annually.\nMonitor sedation, tremor and gait disturbance carefully in older people.\nIf stopping valproate, reduce the dose gradually over at least 4 weeks to minimise the risk of relapse.\n\n【35】 ## Using lamotrigine\nWhen starting lamotrigine:\ncarry out a full blood count, urea and electrolytes and liver function tests be aware of its interaction with valproate follow the instructions for initial dosage and dosage titration outlined in the SPC and BNF, taking into account the need for slow titration in people who have not taken lamotrigine before.\nAdvise people taking lamotrigine to:\ncontact their doctor immediately if they develop a rash while the dose of lamotrigine is being increased tell you if they are pregnant or planning a pregnancy.\nDo not routinely measure plasma lamotrigine levels unless there is evidence of ineffectiveness, poor adherence or toxicity.\nIf stopping lamotrigine, reduce the dose gradually over at least 4 weeks to minimise the risk of relapse.\n\n【36】 ## Recognition and referral\nDo not use questionnaires in primary care to identify bipolar disorder in children or young people.\nIf bipolar disorder is suspected in primary care in children or young people aged under 14 years, refer them to child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS).\nengagement or assertive outreach approaches family involvement and family intervention access to structured psychological interventions and psychologically informed care vocational and educational interventions professionals who are trained and competent in working with young people with bipolar disorder.\nDiagnosis of bipolar disorder in children or young people should be made only after a period of intensive, prospective longitudinal monitoring by a healthcare professional or multidisciplinary team trained and experienced in the assessment, diagnosis and management of bipolar disorder in children and young people, and in collaboration with the child or young person's parents or carers.\nWhen diagnosing bipolar disorder in children or young people take account of the following:\nmania must be present euphoria must be present on most days and for most of the time, for at least 7 days irritability is not a core diagnostic criterion.\nWhen assessing suspected bipolar disorder in children or young people, follow recommendations 1.3.2 to 1.3.4 for adults, but involve parents or carers routinely and take into account the child or young person's educational and social functioning.\n\n【37】 ## Management in young people\nWhen offering treatment to young people with bipolar disorder, take into account their cognitive ability, emotional maturity, developmental level, their capacity to consent to treatment, the severity of their bipolar disorder and risk of suicide or self‑harm or any other risk outlined in recommendation 1.3.5.\nDecember 2022: The MHRA has issued new safety advice on risks associated with valproate for anyone under 55.\n5, In September 2014 aripiprazole had a UK marketing authorisation for up to 12 weeks of treatment for moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar I disorder in young people aged 13 and older.In September 2014, this was an off-label use of olanzapine, risperidone, haloperidol, quetiapine, lamotrigine, lithium and valproate for children and young people.

At the time of publication (September 2014), sodium valproate and valproic acid had UK marketing authorisation for the treatment of epilepsy. Semi‑sodium valproate had a UK marketing authorisation for the treatment of acute mania and for continuation treatment in people who have had mania that has responded to treatment with semi‑sodium valproate. Both semi‑sodium and sodium valproate are metabolised to valproic acid (also known as valproate), which is the pharmacologically active component. Valproate must not be used in pregnancy, and only used in girls and women when there is no alternative and the pregnancy prevention programme is in place. This is because of the risk of malformations and developmental abnormalities in the baby.  update information for important safety advice from the MHRA on the use of valproate\n\n【45】 #Research recommendations\nThe Guideline Development Group has made the following recommendations for research, based on its review of evidence, to improve NICE guidance and patient care in the future\n\n【46】 #Maintenance treatment\nIn the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder, what is the relative effect on quality of life of lithium, an antipsychotic (haloperidol, olanzapine, quetiapine or risperidone), or a combination of lithium and an antipsychotic?\n\n【47】 ## Why this is important\nLithium and antipsychotic medication are known to reduce the risk of relapse when used long‑term in people with bipolar disorder. Relapses do still occur and the response is usually to add another mood‑stabilising drug. However, lithium and antipsychotics are associated with a number of side effects, some of which can adversely affect physical health. The relative effects of lithium, an antipsychotic or a combination of these drugs, regarding efficacy, tolerability, cost effectiveness and quality of life, are unknown. Such information is important to people with bipolar disorder to help them make an informed choice about the treatment options available to them, and to the NHS to inform the best use of resources.\nThe suggested programme of research should involve a pragmatic 3‑arm RCT comparing lithium monotherapy with antipsychotic monotherapy (haloperidol, olanzapine, quetiapine or risperidone) and a combination of lithium and an antipsychotic. The study should last at least 1 year with the primary outcome being quality of life. Symptom control, relapse, function and economic outcomes should also be measured.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

In life-threatening situations, transfusion of appropriate blood products and other emergency measures may be required.\n- Fibrinolytic bleeding may frequently be associated with surgical complications following heart surgery (with or without cardiac bypass procedures) and portacaval shunt; hematological disorders such as amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia (accompanying aplastic anemia); acute and life-threatening abruptio placentae; hepatic cirrhosis; and neoplastic disease such as carcinoma of the prostate, lung, stomach, and cervix.\n- Urinary fibrinolysis, usualIy a normal physiological phenomenon, may contribute to excessive urinary tract fibrinolytic bleeding associated with surgical hematuria (following prostatectomy and nephrectomy) or nonsurgical hematuria (accompanying polycystic or neoplastic diseases of the genitourinary system)\n- An identical dosage regimen may be followed by administering aminocaproic acid tablets or AMICAR oral solution as follows:\n- For the treatment of acute bleeding syndromes due to elevated fibrinolytic activity, it is suggested that 5 aminocaproic acid 1000 mg tablets or 10 aminocaproic acid 500 mg tablets (5 g) or 20 milliliter of aminocaproic acid oral solution (5 g) be administered during the first hour of treatment, followed by a continuing rate of 1 aminocaproic acid 1000 mg Tablet or 2 aminocaproic acid 500 mg tablets (1 g) or 5 milliliter of aminocaproic acid oral solution (1.25 g) per hour. This method of treatment would ordinarily be continued for about 8 hours or until the bleeding situation has been controlled.\n\n【3】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Aminocaproic acid (oral) in adult patients.\n\n【4】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Aminocaproic acid (oral) in adult patients.\n\n【5】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Pediatric)\nThere is limited information regarding FDA-Labeled Use of Aminocaproic acid (oral) in pediatric patients.\n\n【6】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Aminocaproic acid (oral) in pediatric patients.\n\n【7】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Aminocaproic acid (oral) in pediatric patients.\n\n【8】 #Contraindications\n- Aminocaproic acid should not be used when there is evidence of an active intravascular clotting process.\n- When there is uncertainty as to whether the cause of bleeding is primary fibrinolysis or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), this distinction must be made before administering aminocaproic acid.\n- The following tests can be applied to differentiate the two conditions:\n- Platelet count is usually decreased in DIC but normal in primary fibrinolysis.\n\n【9】 - In patients with upper urinary tract bleeding, aminocaproic acid administration has been known to cause intrarenal obstruction in the form of glomerular capillary thrombosis or clots in the renal pelvis and ureters. For this reason, aminocaproic acid should not be used in hematuria of upper urinary tract origin, unless the possible benefits outweigh the risk.\n- Subendocardial hemorrhages have been observed in dogs given intravenous infusions of 0.2 times the maximum human therapeutic dose of aminocaproic acid and in monkeys given 8 times the maximum human therapeutic dose of aminocaproic acid.\n- Rarely, skeletal muscle weakness with necrosis of muscle fibers has been reported following prolonged administration. Clinical presentation may range from mild myalgias with weakness and fatigue to a severe proximal myopathy with rhabdomyolysis, myoglobinuria, and acute renal failure. Muscle enzymes, especially creatine phosphokinase (CPK) are elevated. CPK levels should be monitored in patients on long-term therapy. Aminocaproic acid administration should be stopped if a rise in CPK is noted. Resolution follows discontinuation of aminocaproic acid; however, the syndrome may recur if aminocaproic acid is restarted.\n- The possibility of cardiac muscle damage should also be considered when skeletal myopathy occurs. One case of cardiac and hepatic lesions observed in man has been reported. The patient received 2 g of aminocaproic acid every 6 hours for a total dose of 26 g. Death was due to continued cerebrovascular hemorrhage. Necrotic changes in the heart and liver were noted at autopsy.\n\n【10】 ## Clinical Trials Experience\nThere is limited information regarding Clinical Trial Experience of Aminocaproic acid (oral) in the drug label.\n\n【11】 ## Postmarketing Experience\n- Aminocaproic acid is generally well tolerated. The following adverse experiences have been reported:\n- General: Edema, headache, malaise.\n- Hypersensitivity Reactions: Allergic and anaphylactoid reactions, anaphylaxis.\n- Cardiovascular: Bradycardia, hypotension, peripheral ischemia, thrombosis.\n- Gastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting.\n- Hematologic: Agranulocytosis, coagulation disorder, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia.\n- Musculoskeletal: CPK increased, muscle weakness, myalgia, myopathy , myositis, rhabdomyolysis.\n- Neurologic: Confusion, convulsions, delirium, dizziness, hallucinations, intracranial hypertension, stroke, syncope.\n- Respiratory: Dyspnea, nasal congestion, pulmonary embolism.\n- Skin: Pruritis, rash.\n- Special Senses: Tinnitus, vision decreased, watery eyes.\n- Urogenital: BUN increased, renal failure. There have been some reports of dry ejaculation during the period of aminocaproic acid treatment. These have been reported to date only in hemophilia patients who received the drug after undergoing dental surgical procedures. However, this symptom resolved in all patients within 24 to 48 hours of completion of therapy.\n\n【12】 #Drug Interactions\nThere is limited information regarding Aminocaproic acid (oral) Drug Interactions in the drug label.\n\n【13】 ### Pregnancy\nPregnancy Category (FDA): C\n- Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with aminocaproic acid. It is also not known whether aminocaproic acid can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. aminocaproic acid should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.\n- Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) Pregnancy Category\nThere is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Aminocaproic acid (oral) in women who are pregnant.\n\n【14】 ### Labor and Delivery\nThere is no FDA guidance on use of Aminocaproic acid (oral) during labor and delivery.\n\n【15】 ### Nursing Mothers\n- It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when aminocaproic acid is administered to a nursing woman.\n\n【16】 ### Pediatric Use\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Aminocaproic acid (oral) with respect to pediatric patients.\n\n【17】 ### Geriatic Use\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Aminocaproic acid (oral) with respect to geriatric patients.\n\n【18】 ### Gender\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Aminocaproic acid (oral) with respect to specific gender populations.\n\n【19】 ### Race\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Aminocaproic acid (oral) with respect to specific racial populations.\n\n【20】 ### Renal Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Aminocaproic acid (oral) in patients with renal impairment.\n\n【21】 ### Hepatic Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Aminocaproic acid (oral) in patients with hepatic impairment.\n\n【22】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Aminocaproic acid (oral) in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n\n【23】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\nThere is no FDA guidance one the use of Aminocaproic acid (oral) in patients who are immunocompromised.\n\n【24】 ### Administration\n- Oral\n\n【25】 ### Monitoring\n- Muscle enzymes, especially creatine phosphokinase (CPK) are elevated. CPK levels should be monitored in patients on long-term therapy.\n\n【26】 #IV Compatibility\nThere is limited information regarding IV Compatibility of Aminocaproic acid (oral) in the drug label.\n\n【27】 #Overdosage\n- A few cases of acute overdosage with aminocaproic acid administered intravenously have been reported. The effects have ranged from no reaction to transient hypotension to severe acute renal failure leading to death. One patient with a history of brain tumor and seizures experienced seizures after receiving an 8 gram bolus injection of aminocaproic acid.\n- The single dose of aminocaproic acid causing symptoms of overdosage or considered to be life-threatening is unknown. Patients have tolerated doses as high as 100 grams while acute renal failure has been reported following a dose of 12 grams.\n- No treatment for overdosage is known, although evidence exists that aminocaproic acid is removed by hemodialysis and may be removed by peritoneal dialysis. Pharmacokinetic studies have shown that total body clearance of aminocaproic acid is markedly decreased in patients with severe renal failure.\n\n【28】 ## Structure\n- Aminocaproic acid is soluble in water, acid, and alkaline solutions; it is sparingly soluble in methanol and practically insoluble in chloroform.\n- aminocaproic acid oral solution for oral administration, contains 0.25 g/mL of aminocaproic acid with methylparaben 0.20%, propylparaben 0.05%, edetate disodium 0.30% as preservatives and the following inactive ingredients: sodium saccharin, sorbitol solution, citric acid anhydrous, natural and artificial raspberry flavor and an artificial bitterness modifier.\n- Each aminocaproic acid (aminocaproic acid) Tablet, for oral administration contains 500 mg or 1000 mg of aminocaproic acid and the following inactive ingredients: povidone, crospovidone, stearic acid, and magnesium stearate.\n\n【29】 ## Pharmacodynamics\nThere is limited information regarding Pharmacodynamics of Aminocaproic acid (oral) in the drug label.\n\n【30】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n- The fibrinolysis-inhibitory effects of aminocaproic acid appear to be exerted principally via inhibition of plasminogen activators and to a lesser degree through antiplasmin activity.\n- In adults, oral absorption appears to be a zero-order process with an absorption rate of 5.2 g/hr. The mean lag time in absorption is 10 minutes. After a single oral dose of 5 g, absorption was complete (F=1). Mean ± SD peak plasma concentrations (164 ± 28 mcg/mL) were reached within 1.2 ± 0.45 hours.\n- After oral administration, the apparent volume of distribution was estimated to be 23.1 ± 6.6 L (mean ± SD). Correspondingly, the volume of distribution after intravenous administration has been reported to be 30.0 ± 8.2 L. After prolonged administration, aminocaproic acid has been found to distribute throughout extravascular and intravascular compartments of the body, penetrating human red blood cells as well as other tissue cells.\n- Renal excretion is the primary route of elimination. Sixty-five percent of the dose is recovered in the urine as unchanged drug and 11% of the dose appears as the metabolite adipic acid. Renal clearance (116 mL/min) approximates endogenous creatinine clearance. The total body clearance is 169 mL/min. The terminal elimination half-life for aminocaproic acid is approximately 2 hours.\n\n【31】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\nThere is limited information regarding Nonclinical Toxicology of Aminocaproic acid (oral) in the drug label.\n\n【32】 #Clinical Studies\nThere is limited information regarding Clinical Studies of Aminocaproic acid (oral) in the drug label.\n\n【33】 #How Supplied\n- Aminocaproic acid oral solution, 0.25 g/mL\n- Each mL of raspberry-flavored oral solution contains 0.25 g/mL of aminocaproic acid.\n- 16 Fl. Oz.\n- AMICAR 500 mg Tablets\n- Each round, white tablet, engraved with XP on one side and scored on the other with A to the left of the score and 10 on the right, contains 500 mg of aminocaproic acid.\n\n【34】 ## Storage\n- Store at 20°-25°C (68°-77°F); Dispense in Tight Containers; Do Not Freeze.\n\n【35】 #Patient Counseling Information\nThere is limited information regarding Patient Counseling Information of Aminocaproic acid (oral) in the drug label.\n\n【36】 #Precautions with Alcohol\n- Alcohol-Aminocaproic acid (oral) interaction has not been established. Talk to your doctor about the effects of taking alcohol with this medication.\n\n【37】 #Brand Names\n- AMICAR\n\n【38】 #Look-Alike Drug Names\nThere is limited information regarding Aminocaproic acid (oral) Look-Alike Drug Names in the drug label.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "99bc845d-c760-45ea-a39f-9a5ac8106eb3", "title": null, "text": "【0】 Linagliptin and Metformin hydrochloride\n\n【1】 #Overview\nLinagliptin and Metformin hydrochloride is a hypoglycemic agent that is FDA approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus  Common adverse reactions include nasopharyngitis and diarrhea.\n\n【2】 ### Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus\n- JENTADUETO tablets are indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus when treatment with both linagliptin and metformin is appropriate.\n\n【3】 ### Important Limitations of Use\n- JENTADUETO should not be used in patients with type 1 diabetes or for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis, as it would not be effective in these settings.\n- Dosing information:\n- Recommended Dosing:\n- The dosage of JENTADUETO should be individualized on the basis of both effectiveness and tolerability, while not exceeding the maximum recommended dose of 2.5 mg linagliptin/1000 mg metformin hydrochloride twice daily. JENTADUETO should be given twice daily with meals. Dose escalation should be gradual to reduce the gastrointestinal (GI) side effects associated with metformin use. For available dosage forms and strengths see.\n- In patients currently not treated with metformin, initiate treatment with 2.5 mg linagliptin/500 mg metformin hydrochloride twice daily\n- In patients already treated with metformin, start with 2.5 mg linagliptin and the current dose of metformin taken at each of the two daily meals (e.g. a patient on metformin 1000 mg twice daily would be started on 2.5 mg linagliptin/1000 mg metformin hydrochloride twice daily with meals).\n- Patients already treated with linagliptin and metformin individual components may be switched to JENTADUETO containing the same doses of each component.\n- No studies have been performed specifically examining the safety and efficacy of JENTADUETO in patients previously treated with other oral antihyperglycemic agents and switched to JENTADUETO. Any change in therapy of type 2 diabetes mellitus should be undertaken with care and appropriate monitoring as changes in glycemic control can occur.\n- Concomitant Use with an Insulin Secretagogue (e.g. Sulfonylurea) or with Insulin:\n- When JENTADUETO is used in combination with an insulin secretagogue (e.g. sulfonylurea) or with insulin, a lower dose of the insulin secretagogue or insulin may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia.\n\n【4】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\n- There is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Linagliptin and Metformin hydrochloride in adult patients.\n\n【5】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n- There is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Linagliptin and Metformin hydrochloride in adult patients.\n\n【6】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Pediatric)\nThere is limited information regarding Linagliptin and Metformin hydrochloride FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Pediatric) in the drug label.\n\n【7】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\n- There is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Linagliptin and Metformin hydrochloride in pediatric patients.\n\n【8】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n- There is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Linagliptin and Metformin hydrochloride in pediatric patients.\n\n【9】 #Contraindications\nJENTADUETO is contraindicated in patients with:\n- Renal impairment (e.g. serum creatinine ≥1.5 mg/dL for men, ≥1.4 mg/dL for women, or abnormal creatinine clearance), which may also result from conditions such as cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, and septicemia.\n- Acute or chronic metabolic acidosis, including diabetic ketoacidosis. Diabetic ketoacidosis should be treated with insulin.\n- A history of hypersensitivity reaction to linagliptin, such as anaphylaxis, angioedema, exfoliative skin conditions, urticaria, or bronchial hyperreactivity.\n- Hypersensitivity to metformin\n\n【10】 Lactic Acidosis\nMetformin\n- Lactic acidosis is a serious, metabolic complication that can occur due to metformin accumulation during treatment with JENTADUETO and is fatal in approximately 50% of cases. Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (>5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels of >5 µg/mL are generally found.\n- The reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin is approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, (with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal impairment, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia due to unstable or acute failure, are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal impairment and the patient’s age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Metformin treatment should not be initiated in any patient unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced. In addition, metformin should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, metformin should be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic impairment. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake when taking metformin, since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin on lactate metabolism. In addition, metformin should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure necessitating restricted intake of food or fluids. Use of topiramate, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, in epilepsy and migraine prophylaxis may cause dose-dependent metabolic acidosis and may exacerbate the risk of metformin-induced lactic acidosis.\n- To rule out lactic acidosis, serum electrolytes, ketones, blood glucose, blood pH, lactate levels, and blood metformin levels may be useful. Levels of fasting venous plasma lactate above the upper limit of normal but less than 5 mmol/L in patients taking metformin do not necessarily indicate impending lactic acidosis and may be due to other mechanisms, such as poorly-controlled diabetes or obesity, vigorous physical activity, or technical problems in sample handling.\nPancreatitis - There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis, including fatal pancreatitis, in patients taking linagliptin. Take careful notice of potential signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, promptly discontinue JENTADUETO and initiate appropriate management. It is unknown whether patients with a history of pancreatitis are at increased risk for the development of pancreatitis while using JENTADUETO.\nMonitoring of Renal Function\n- Although linagliptin undergoes minimal renal excretion, metformin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney. The risk of metformin accumulation and lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal impairment. Therefore, JENTADUETO is contraindicated in patients with renal impairment.\n- Before initiation of therapy with JENTADUETO and at least annually thereafter, renal function should be assessed and verified to be normal. In patients in whom development of renal impairment is anticipated (e.g. elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently and JENTADUETO discontinued if evidence of renal impairment is present.\n- Use of concomitant medications that may affect renal function or metformin disposition:\n- Concomitant medication(s) that may affect renal function or result in significant hemodynamic change or interfere with the disposition of metformin should be used with caution.\n- Radiological studies and surgical procedures:\n- JENTADUETO should be temporarily discontinued for any surgical procedure (except minor procedures not associated with restricted intake of food and fluids) and should not be restarted until the patient’s oral intake has resumed and renal function has been evaluated as normal.\nImpaired Hepatic Function\n- Because impaired hepatic function has been associated with some cases of lactic acidosis with metformin therapy, JENTADUETO should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\nUse with Medications Known to Cause Hypoglycemia\nLinagliptin\n- Insulin secretagogues and insulin are known to cause hypoglycemia. The use of linagliptin in combination with an insulin secretagogue (e.g. sulfonylurea) was associated with a higher rate of hypoglycemia compared with placebo in a clinical trial. The use of linagliptin in combination with insulin in subjects with severe renal impairment was associated with a higher rate of hypoglycemia. Therefore, a lower dose of the insulin secretagogue or insulin may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with JENTADUETO.\nHypersensitivity Reactions\nVitamin B12 Levels\n- In controlled, 29-week clinical trials of metformin, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels, without clinical manifestations, was observed in approximately 7% of metformin-treated patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, is, however, very rarely associated with anemia or neurologic manifestations due to the short duration (<1 year) of the clinical trials. This risk may be more relevant to patients receiving long-term treatment with metformin, and adverse hematologic and neurologic reactions have been reported postmarketing. The decrease in vitamin B12 levels appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin B12 supplementation. Measurement of hematologic parameters on an annual basis is advised in patients on JENTADUETO and any apparent abnormalities should be appropriately investigated and managed. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels. In these patients, routine serum vitamin B12 measurement at 2- to 3-year intervals may be useful.\nAlcohol Intake\nHypoxic States\n- Cardiovascular collapse (shock) from whatever cause (e.g. acute congestive heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, and other conditions characterized by hypoxemia) have been associated with lactic acidosis and may also cause prerenal azotemia. When such events occur in patients on JENTADUETO therapy, the drug should be promptly discontinued.\nMacrovascular Outcomes\n- There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with linagliptin or metformin or any other antidiabetic drug.\n\n【11】 ## Clinical Trials Experience\n- Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.\nLinagliptin/Metformin\n- The safety of concomitantly administered linagliptin (daily dose 5 mg) and metformin (mean daily dose of approximately 1800 mg) has been evaluated in 2816 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus treated for ≥12 weeks in clinical trials.\n- Three placebo-controlled studies with linagliptin + metformin were conducted: 2 studies were 24 weeks in duration, 1 study was 12 weeks in duration. In the 3 placebo-controlled clinical studies, adverse events which occurred in ≥5% of patients receiving linagliptin + metformin (n=875) and were more common than in patients given placebo + metformin (n=539) included nasopharyngitis (5.7% vs 4.3%).\n\n【12】 - Other adverse reactions reported in clinical studies with treatment of linagliptin + metformin were hypersensitivity (e.g. urticaria, angioedema, or bronchial hyperreactivity), cough, decreased appetite, nausea, vomiting, pruritus, and pancreatitis.\n- Adverse reactions reported in ≥2% of patients treated with linagliptin 5 mg and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo included: nasopharyngitis (7.0% vs 6.1%), diarrhea (3.3% vs 3.0%), and cough (2.1% vs 1.4%).\n- Rates for other adverse reactions for linagliptin 5 mg vs placebo when linagliptin was used in combination with specific anti-diabetic agents were: urinary tract infection (3.1% vs 0%) and hypertriglyceridemia (2.4% vs 0%) when linagliptin was used as add-on to sulfonylurea; hyperlipidemia (2.7% vs 0.8%) and weight increased (2.3% vs 0.8%) when linagliptin was used as add-on to pioglitazone; and constipation (2.1% vs 1%) when linagliptin was used as add-on to basal insulin therapy.\n- Other adverse reactions reported in clinical studies with treatment of linagliptin monotherapy were hypersensitivity (e.g. urticaria, angioedema, localized skin exfoliation, or bronchial hyperreactivity) and myalgia. In the clinical trial program, pancreatitis was reported in 15.2 cases per 10,000 patient year exposure while being treated with linagliptin compared with 3.7 cases per 10,000 patient year exposure while being treated with comparator (placebo and active comparator, sulfonylurea). Three additional cases of pancreatitis were reported following the last administered dose of linagliptin.\nMetformin\n- The most common adverse reactions due to initiation of metformin are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, flatulence, asthenia, indigestion, abdominal discomfort, and headache.\n- Long-term treatment with metformin has been associated with a decrease in vitamin B12 absorption which may very rarely result in clinically significant vitamin B12 deficiency (e.g. megaloblastic anemia).\nHypoglycemia - In a 24-week factorial design study, hypoglycemia was reported in 4 (1.4%) of 286 subjects treated with linagliptin + metformin, 6 (2.1%) of 291 subjects treated with metformin, and 1 (1.4%) of 72 subjects treated with placebo. When linagliptin was administered in combination with metformin and a sulfonylurea, 181 (22.9%) of 792 patients reported hypoglycemia compared with 39 (14.8%) of 263 patients administered placebo in combination with metformin and sulfonylurea. Adverse reactions of hypoglycemia were based on all reports of hypoglycemia. A concurrent glucose measurement was not required or was normal in some patients. Therefore, it is not possible to conclusively determine that all these reports reflect true hypoglycemia.\nUse in Renal Impairment\n- Renal function as measured by mean eGFR and creatinine clearance did not change over 52 weeks’ treatment compared to placebo.\nLaboratory Tests\n- Changes in laboratory findings were similar in patients treated with linagliptin + metformin compared to patients treated with placebo + metformin. Changes in laboratory values that occurred more frequently in the linagliptin + metformin group and ≥1% more than in the placebo group were not detected.\n- No clinically meaningful changes in vital signs were observed in patients treated with linagliptin.\n\n【13】 ## Postmarketing Experience\n- The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of linagliptin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.\n- Acute pancreatitis, including fatal pancreatitis - Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions\n- Rash\n\n【14】 #Drug Interactions\nDrug Interactions with Metformin:\nCationic Drugs\n- Cationic drugs (e.g. amiloride, digoxin, morphine, procainamide, quinidine, quinine, ranitidine, triamterene, trimethoprim, or vancomycin) that are eliminated by renal tubular secretion theoretically have the potential for interaction with metformin by competing for common renal tubular transport systems. Although such interactions remain theoretical (except for cimetidine), careful patient monitoring and dose adjustment of JENTADUETO and/or the interfering drug is recommended in patients who are taking cationic medications that are excreted via the proximal renal tubular secretory system.\nCarbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors\n- Topiramate or other carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (e.g. zonisamide, acetazolamide or dichlorphenamide) frequently decrease serum bicarbonate and induce non-anion gap, hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. Concomitant use of these drugs may induce metabolic acidosis. Use these drugs with caution in patients treated with JENTADUETO, as the risk of lactic acidosis may increase.\nInducers of P-glycoprotein and CYP3A4 Enzymes\n- Rifampin decreased linagliptin exposure, suggesting that the efficacy of linagliptin may be reduced when administered in combination with a strong P-gp inducer or CYP 3A4 inducer. As JENTADUETO is a fixed-dose combination of linagliptin and metformin, use of alternative treatments (not containing linagliptin) is strongly recommended when concomitant treatment with a strong P-gp or CYP 3A4 inducer is necessary.\nDrugs Affecting Glycemic Control\n\n【15】 ### Pregnancy\nPregnancy Category (FDA): B\nJENTADUETO\n- There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women with JENTADUETO or its individual components, and some clinical data is available for metformin which indicate that the risk for major malformations was not increased when metformin is taken during the first trimester in pregnancy. In addition, metformin was not associated with increased perinatal complications. Nevertheless, because these clinical data cannot rule out the possibility of harm, JENTADUETO should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.\n- JENTADUETO was not teratogenic when administered to Wistar Han rats during the period of organogenesis at doses similar to clinical exposure. At higher maternally toxic doses (9 and 23 times the clinical dose based on exposure), the metformin component of the combination was associated with an increased incidence of fetal rib and scapula malformations.\nLinagliptin\n- Linagliptin crosses the placenta into the fetus following oral dosing in pregnant rats and rabbits.\nMetformin Hydrochloride\n- Metformin has been studied for embryo-fetal effects in 2 rat strains and in rabbits. Metformin was not teratogenic in Sprague Dawley rats up to 600 mg/kg or in Wistar Han rats up to 200 mg/kg (2-3 times the clinical dose based on body surface area or exposure, respectively). At higher maternally toxic doses (9 and 23 times the clinical dose based on exposure), an increased incidence of rib and scapula skeletal malformations was observed in the Wistar Han strain. Metformin was not teratogenic in rabbits at doses up to 140 mg/kg (similar to clinical dose based on body surface area).\n- Metformin administered to female Sprague Dawley rats from gestation day 6 to lactation day 21 up to 600 mg/kg/day (2 times the maximum clinical dose based on body surface area) had no effect on prenatal or postnatal development of offspring.\n- Metformin crosses the placenta into the fetus in rats and humans.\nThere is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Linagliptin and Metformin hydrochloride in women who are pregnant.\n\n【16】 ### Labor and Delivery\nThere is no FDA guidance on use of Linagliptin and Metformin hydrochloride during labor and delivery.\n\n【17】 ### Nursing Mothers\n- No studies in lactating animals have been conducted with the combined components of JENTADUETO. In studies performed with the individual components, both linagliptin and metformin were secreted in the milk of lactating rats. It is not known whether linagliptin is excreted in human milk. Metformin is excreted in human milk in low concentrations. Because the potential for hypoglycemia in nursing infants may exist, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\n\n【18】 ### Pediatric Use\n- Safety and effectiveness of JENTADUETO in pediatric patients under 18 years of age have not been established.\n\n【19】 ### Geriatic Use\n- Linagliptin is minimally excreted by the kidney; however, metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Considering that aging can be associated with reduced renal function, JENTADUETO should be used with caution as age increases.\nLinagliptin\n- There were 4040 type 2 diabetes patients treated with linagliptin 5 mg from 15 clinical trials of linagliptin; 1085 (27%) patients were 65 years and over, while 131 (3%) were 75 years and over. Of these patients, 2566 were enrolled in 12 double-blind placebo-controlled studies; 591 (23%) were 65 years and over, while 82 (3%) were 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between patients 65 years and over and younger patients. Therefore, no dose adjustment is recommended in the elderly population. While clinical studies of linagliptin have not identified differences in response between the elderly and younger patients, greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.\nMetformin\n- Controlled clinical studies of metformin did not include sufficient numbers of elderly patients to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients, although other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and young patients. The initial and maintenance dosing of metformin should be conservative in patients with advanced age, due to the potential for decreased renal function in this population. Any dose adjustment should be based on a careful assessment of renal function.\n\n【20】 ### Gender\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Linagliptin and Metformin hydrochloride with respect to specific gender populations.\n\n【21】 ### Race\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Linagliptin and Metformin hydrochloride with respect to specific racial populations.\n\n【22】 ### Renal Impairment\n- Although linagliptin undergoes minimal renal excretion, metformin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney. The risk of metformin accumulation and lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal impairment. Therefore, JENTADUETO is contraindicated in patients with renal impairment.\n- Before initiation of therapy with JENTADUETO and at least annually thereafter, renal function should be assessed and verified to be normal. In patients in whom development of renal impairment is anticipated (e.g. elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently and JENTADUETO discontinued if evidence of renal impairment is present.\n- Use of concomitant medications that may affect renal function or metformin disposition:\n- Concomitant medication(s) that may affect renal function or result in significant hemodynamic change or interfere with the disposition of metformin should be used with caution.\n- Radiological studies and surgical procedures:\n- Radiologic studies involving the use of intravascular iodinated contrast materials (e.g. intravenous urogram, intravenous cholangiography, angiography, and computed tomography) can lead to acute alteration of renal function and have been associated with lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin. Therefore, in patients in whom any such study is planned, JENTADUETO should be temporarily discontinued at the time of or prior to the procedure, and withheld for 48 hours subsequent to the procedure and reinstituted only after renal function has been confirmed to be normal.\n- JENTADUETO should be temporarily discontinued for any surgical procedure (except minor procedures not associated with restricted intake of food and fluids) and should not be restarted until the patient’s oral intake has resumed and renal function has been evaluated as normal.\n\n【23】 ### Hepatic Impairment\n- Because impaired hepatic function has been associated with some cases of lactic acidosis with metformin therapy, JENTADUETO should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n\n【24】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Linagliptin and Metformin hydrochloride in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n\n【25】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\nThere is no FDA guidance one the use of Linagliptin and Metformin hydrochloride in patients who are immunocompromised.\n\n【26】 ### Administration\nRecommended Dosing\n- The dosage of JENTADUETO should be individualized on the basis of both effectiveness and tolerability, while not exceeding the maximum recommended dose of 2.5 mg linagliptin/1000 mg metformin hydrochloride twice daily. JENTADUETO should be given twice daily with meals. Dose escalation should be gradual to reduce the gastrointestinal (GI) side effects associated with metformin use. For available dosage forms and strengths see.\n- Recommended starting dose:\n- In patients currently not treated with metformin, initiate treatment with 2.5 mg linagliptin/500 mg metformin hydrochloride twice daily\n- In patients already treated with metformin, start with 2.5 mg linagliptin and the current dose of metformin taken at each of the two daily meals (e.g. a patient on metformin 1000 mg twice daily would be started on 2.5 mg linagliptin/1000 mg metformin hydrochloride twice daily with meals).\n- Patients already treated with linagliptin and metformin individual components may be switched to JENTADUETO containing the same doses of each component.\n- No studies have been performed specifically examining the safety and efficacy of JENTADUETO in patients previously treated with other oral antihyperglycemic agents and switched to JENTADUETO. Any change in therapy of type 2 diabetes mellitus should be undertaken with care and appropriate monitoring as changes in glycemic control can occur.\nConcomitant Use with an Insulin Secretagogue (e.g. Sulfonylurea) or with Insulin\n- When JENTADUETO is used in combination with an insulin secretagogue (e.g. sulfonylurea) or with insulin, a lower dose of the insulin secretagogue or insulin may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia.\n\n【27】 ### Dosage forms and strengths\n- JENTADUETO is a combination of linagliptin and metformin hydrochloride. JENTADUETO tablets are available in the following dosage forms and strengths:\n- 2.5 mg linagliptin/500 mg metformin hydrochloride tablets are light yellow, oval, biconvex tablets debossed with “D2/500” on one side and the Boehringer Ingelheim logo on the other side\n\n【28】 ### Monitoring\n- There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with linagliptin (one of the components of JENTADUETO) including anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions. In such cases, promptly discontinue JENTADUETO, assess for other potential causes, institute appropriate monitoring and treatment, and initiate alternative treatment for diabetes.\n- Vitamin B12 deficiency: Metformin may lower vitamin B12 levels. Monitor hematologic parameters annually.\n- Monitoring of Renal Function:\n- Blood Glucose and A1C Monitoring:\n- Inform patients that response to all diabetic therapies should be monitored by periodic measurements of blood glucose and A1C levels, with a goal of decreasing these levels toward the normal range. A1C monitoring is especially useful for evaluating long-term glycemic control.\n\n【29】 #IV Compatibility\nThere is limited information regarding the compatibility of Linagliptin and Metformin hydrochloride and IV administrations.\n\n【30】 #Overdosage\n- In the event of an overdose with JENTADUETO, contact the Poison Control Center. Employ the usual supportive measures (e.g. remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring, and institute supportive treatment) as dictated by the patient’s clinical status. Removal of linagliptin by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is unlikely. However, metformin is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions. Therefore, hemodialysis may be useful partly for removal of accumulated metformin from patients in whom JENTADUETO overdosage is suspected.\nLinagliptin\n- During controlled clinical trials in healthy subjects, with single doses of up to 600 mg of linagliptin (equivalent to 120 times the recommended daily dose), there were no dose-related clinical adverse drug reactions. There is no experience with doses above 600 mg in humans.\nMetformin\n- Overdose of metformin has occurred, including ingestion of amounts greater than 50 grams. Hypoglycemia was reported in approximately 10% of cases, but no causal association with metformin has been established. Lactic acidosis has been reported in approximately 32% of metformin overdose cases.\n\n【31】 #Pharmacology\nThere is limited information regarding Linagliptin and Metformin hydrochloride Pharmacology in the drug label.\n\n【32】 ## Mechanism of Action\nJENTADUETO\n- JENTADUETO combines 2 antihyperglycemic agents with complementary mechanisms of action to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: linagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, and metformin, a member of the biguanide class.\nLinagliptin\n- Linagliptin is an inhibitor of DPP-4, an enzyme that degrades the incretin hormones glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP). Thus, linagliptin increases the concentrations of active incretin hormones, stimulating the release of insulin in a glucose-dependent manner and decreasing the levels of glucagon in the circulation. Both incretin hormones are involved in the physiological regulation of glucose homeostasis. Incretin hormones are secreted at a low basal level throughout the day and levels rise immediately after meal intake. GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin biosynthesis and secretion from pancreatic beta cells in the presence of normal and elevated blood glucose levels. Furthermore, GLP-1 also reduces glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, resulting in a reduction in hepatic glucose output.\nMetformin\n\n【33】 ## Structure\nJENTADUETO tablets contain 2 oral antihyperglycemic drugs used in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus: linagliptin and metformin hydrochloride.\nLinagliptin\n- Linagliptin is an orally-active inhibitor of the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) enzyme.\n- Linagliptin is described chemically as 1H-Purine-2,6-dione, 8--7-(2-butyn-1-yl)-3,7-dihydro-3-methyl-1-\n- The empirical formula is C25H28N8O2 and the molecular weight is 472.54 g/mol. The structural formula is:\n- Linagliptin is a white to yellowish, not or only slightly hygroscopic solid substance. It is very slightly soluble in water (0.9 mg/mL). Linagliptin is soluble in methanol (ca. 60 mg/mL), sparingly soluble in ethanol (ca. 10 mg/mL), very slightly soluble in isopropanol (<1 mg/mL), and very slightly soluble in acetone (ca. 1 mg/mL).\nMetformin Hydrochloride\n- Metformin hydrochloride (N,N-dimethylimidodicarbonimidic diamide hydrochloride) is not chemically or pharmacologically related to any other classes of oral antihyperglycemic agents. Metformin hydrochloride is a white to off-white crystalline compound with a molecular formula of C4H11N5HCl and a molecular weight of 165.63. Metformin hydrochloride is freely soluble in water and is practically insoluble in acetone, ether, and chloroform. The pKa of metformin is 12.4. The pH of a 1% aqueous solution of metformin hydrochloride is 6.68. The structural formula is:\nJENTADUETO\n- JENTADUETO is available for oral administration as tablets containing 2.5 mg linagliptin and 500 mg metformin hydrochloride (JENTADUETO 2.5 mg/500 mg), 850 mg metformin hydrochloride (JENTADUETO 2.5 mg/850 mg) or 1000 mg metformin hydrochloride (JENTADUETO 2.5 mg/1000 mg). Each film-coated tablet of JENTADUETO contains the following inactive ingredients: arginine, corn starch, copovidone, colloidal silicon dioxide, magnesium stearate, titanium dioxide, propylene glycol, hypromellose, talc, yellow ferric oxide (2.5 mg/500 mg; 2.5 mg/850 mg) and/or red ferric oxide (2.5 mg/850 mg; 2.5 mg/1000 mg).\n\n【34】 ## Pharmacodynamics\nLinagliptin\n- Linagliptin binds to DPP-4 in a reversible manner and increases the concentrations of incretin hormones. Linagliptin glucose-dependently increases insulin secretion and lowers glucagon secretion, thus resulting in a better regulation of the glucose homeostasis. Linagliptin binds selectively to DPP-4 and selectively inhibits DPP-4, but not DPP-8 or DPP-9 activity in vitro at concentrations approximating therapeutic exposures.\nCardiac Electrophysiology\n- In a randomized, placebo-controlled, active-comparator, 4-way crossover study, 36 healthy subjects were administered a single oral dose of linagliptin 5 mg, linagliptin 100 mg (20 times the recommended dose), moxifloxacin, and placebo. No increase in QTc was observed with either the recommended dose of 5 mg or the 100-mg dose. At the 100-mg dose, peak linagliptin plasma concentrations were approximately 38-fold higher than the peak concentrations following a 5-mg dose.\n\n【35】 ## Pharmacokinetics\nJENTADUETO\n- The results of a bioequivalence study in healthy subjects demonstrated that JENTADUETO (linagliptin/metformin hydrochloride) 2.5 mg/500 mg, 2.5 mg/850 mg, and 2.5 mg/1000 mg combination tablets are bioequivalent to coadministration of corresponding doses of linagliptin and metformin as individual tablets. Administration of linagliptin 2.5 mg/metformin hydrochloride 1000 mg fixed-dose combination with food resulted in no change in overall exposure of linagliptin. There was no change in metformin AUC; however, mean peak serum concentration of metformin was decreased by 18% when administered with food. A delayed time-to-peak serum concentrations by 2 hours was observed for metformin under fed conditions. These changes are not likely to be clinically significant.\nAbsorption\nLinagliptin\nMetformin\n- The absolute bioavailability of a metformin hydrochloride 500-mg tablet given under fasting conditions is approximately 50% to 60%. Studies using single oral doses of metformin tablets 500 mg to 1500 mg, and 850 mg to 2550 mg, indicate that there is a lack of dose proportionality with increasing doses, which is due to decreased absorption rather than an alteration in elimination.\nDistribution\nMetabolism\n- Following oral administration, the majority (about 90%) of linagliptin is excreted unchanged, indicating that metabolism represents a minor elimination pathway. A small fraction of absorbed linagliptin is metabolized to a pharmacologically inactive metabolite, which shows a steady-state exposure of 13.3% relative to linagliptin.\n- Intravenous single-dose studies in normal subjects demonstrate that metformin is excreted unchanged in the urine and does not undergo hepatic metabolism (no metabolites have been identified in humans) nor biliary excretion.\nExcretion\n- Renal clearance is approximately 3.5 times greater than creatinine clearance, which indicates that tubular secretion is the major route of metformin elimination. Following oral administration, approximately 90% of the absorbed drug is eliminated via the renal route within the first 24 hours, with a plasma elimination half-life of approximately 6.2 hours. In blood, the elimination half-life is approximately 17.6 hours, suggesting that the erythrocyte mass may be a compartment of distribution.\nSpecific Populations\nRenal Impairment\n- JENTADUETO: Studies characterizing the pharmacokinetics of linagliptin and metformin after administration of JENTADUETO in renally impaired patients have not been performed. Since metformin is contraindicated in patients with renal impairment, use of JENTADUETO is also contraindicated in patients with renal impairment (e.g. serum creatinine ≥1.5 mg/dL  or ≥1.4 mg/dL , or abnormal creatinine clearance).\n- Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and severe renal impairment showed steady-state exposure approximately 40% higher than that of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and normal renal function (increase in AUC by 42% and Cmax by 35%). For both type 2 diabetes mellitus groups, renal excretion was below 7% of the administered dose.\n- Metformin: In patients with decreased renal function (based on measured creatinine clearance), the plasma and blood half-life of metformin is prolonged and the renal clearance is decreased in proportion to the decrease in creatinine clearance.\nHepatic Impairment\n- Linagliptin: In patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A) steady-state exposure (AUCτ,ss) of linagliptin was approximately 25% lower and Cmax,ss was approximately 36% lower than in healthy subjects. In patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B), AUCss of linagliptin was about 14% lower and Cmax,ss was approximately 8% lower than in healthy subjects. Patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) had comparable exposure of linagliptin in terms of AUC0-24 and approximately 23% lower Cmax compared with healthy subjects. Reductions in the pharmacokinetic parameters seen in patients with hepatic impairment did not result in reductions in DPP-4 inhibition.\n- Metformin hydrochloride: No pharmacokinetic studies of metformin have been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment.\nBody Mass Index (BMI)/Weight\n- Linagliptin: BMI/Weight had no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of linagliptin based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis.\nGender\nGeriatric\n- Studies characterizing the pharmacokinetics of linagliptin and metformin after administration of JENTADUETO in pediatric patients have not yet been performed.\nRace\nDrug Interactions\n- Pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies with JENTADUETO have not been performed; however, such studies have been conducted with the individual components of JENTADUETO (linagliptin and metformin hydrochloride).\n- In vitro Assessment of Drug Interactions\n- Linagliptin is a weak to moderate inhibitor of CYP isozyme CYP3A4, but does not inhibit other CYP isozymes and is not an inducer of CYP isozymes, including CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 4A11.\n- Linagliptin is a P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate, and inhibits P-gp mediated transport of digoxin at high concentrations. Based on these results and in vivo drug interaction studies, linagliptin is considered unlikely to cause interactions with other P-gp substrates at therapeutic concentrations.\n- Strong inducers of CYP3A4 or P-gp (e.g. rifampin) decrease exposure to linagliptin to subtherapeutic and likely ineffective concentrations. For patients requiring use of such drugs, an alternative to linagliptin is strongly recommended. In vivo studies indicated evidence of a low propensity for causing drug interactions with substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C8, P-gp, and OCT. No dose adjustment of linagliptin is recommended based on results of the described pharmacokinetic studies.\n\n【36】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\nCarcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\nJENTADUETO\n- No animal studies have been conducted with the combined products in JENTADUETO to evaluate carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, or impairment of fertility. General toxicity studies in rats up to 13 weeks were performed with JENTADUETO.\n- The following data are based on the findings in studies with linagliptin and metformin individually.\nLinagliptin\n- Linagliptin did not increase the incidence of tumors in male and female rats in a 2-year study at doses of 6, 18, and 60 mg/kg. The highest dose of 60 mg/kg is approximately 418 times the clinical dose of 5 mg/day based on AUC exposure. Linagliptin did not increase the incidence of tumors in mice in a 2-year study at doses up to 80 mg/kg (males) and 25 mg/kg (females), or approximately 35 and 270 times the clinical dose based on AUC exposure. Higher doses of linagliptin in female mice (80 mg/kg) increased the incidence of lymphoma at approximately 215 times the clinical dose based on AUC exposure.\n- Linagliptin was not mutagenic or clastogenic with or without metabolic activation in the Ames bacterial mutagenicity assay, a chromosomal aberration test in human lymphocytes, and an in vivo micronucleus assay.\n- In fertility studies in rats, linagliptin had no adverse effects on early embryonic development, mating, fertility, or bearing live young up to the highest dose of 240 mg/kg (approximately 943 times the clinical dose based on AUC exposure).\nMetformin Hydrochloride\n- There was no evidence of a mutagenic potential of metformin in the following in vitro tests: Ames test (Salmonella typhimurium), gene mutation test (mouse lymphoma cells), or chromosomal aberrations test (human lymphocytes). Results in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test were also negative.\n- Fertility of male or female rats was unaffected by metformin when administered at doses as high as 600 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons.\n\n【37】 #Clinical Studies\n- The coadministration of linagliptin and metformin has been studied in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus inadequately controlled on diet and exercise and in combination with sulfonylurea.\nInitial Combination Therapy with Linagliptin and Metformin\n- A total of 791 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and inadequate glycemic control on diet and exercise participated in the 24-week, randomized, double-blind, portion of this placebo-controlled factorial study designed to assess the efficacy of linagliptin as initial therapy with metformin. Patients on an antihyperglycemic agent (52%) underwent a drug washout period of 4 weeks’ duration. After the washout period and after completing a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C ≥7.0% to ≤10.5%) were randomized. Patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C ≥7.5% to <11.0%) not on antihyperglycemic agents at study entry (48%) immediately entered the 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period and then were randomized. Randomization was stratified by baseline A1C (<8.5% vs ≥8.5%) and use of a prior oral antidiabetic drug (none vs monotherapy). Patients were randomized in a 1:2:2:2:2:2 ratio to either placebo or one of 5 active-treatment arms. Approximately equal numbers of patients were randomized to receive initial therapy with 5 mg of linagliptin once daily, 500 mg or 1000 mg of metformin twice daily, or 2.5 mg of linagliptin twice daily in combination with 500 mg or 1000 mg of metformin twice daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the study were treated with sulfonylurea, thiazolidinedione, or insulin rescue therapy.\n- Initial therapy with the combination of linagliptin and metformin provided significant improvements in A1C, and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) compared to placebo, to metformin alone, and to linagliptin alone . The adjusted mean treatment difference in A1C from baseline to week 24 (LOCF) was -0.5% (95% CI -0.7, -0.3; p<0.0001) for linagliptin 2.5 mg/metformin 1000 mg twice daily compared to metformin 1000 mg twice daily; -1.1% (95% CI -1.4, -0.9; p<0.0001) for linagliptin 2.5 mg/metformin 1000 mg twice daily compared to linagliptin 5 mg once daily; -0.6% (95% CI -0.8, -0.4; p<0.0001) for linagliptin 2.5 mg/metformin 500 mg twice daily compared to metformin 500 mg twice daily; and -0.8% (95% CI -1.0, -0.6; p<0.0001) for linagliptin 2.5 mg/metformin 500 mg twice daily compared to linagliptin 5 mg once daily.\n- Lipid effects were generally neutral. No meaningful change in body weight was noted in any of the 6 treatment groups.\n- A total of 316 patients with type 2 diabetes diagnosed within the previous 12 months and treatment-naïve (no antidiabetic therapy for 12 weeks prior to randomization) and inadequate glycemic control (A1C ≥8.5% to ≤12.0%) participated in a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, study designed to assess the efficacy of linagliptin in combination with metformin vs linagliptin. Patients were randomized (1:1), after a 2-week run-in period, to either linagliptin 5 mg plus metformin (1500 to 2000 mg per day, n=159) or linagliptin 5 mg plus placebo, (n=157) administered once daily. Patients in the linagliptin and metformin treatment group were up-titrated to a maximum tolerated dose of metformin (1000 to 2000 mg per day) over a three-week period.\n- Initial therapy with the combination of linagliptin and metformin provided statistically significant improvements in A1C compared to linagliptin . The mean difference between groups in A1C change from baseline was -0.8% with 2-sided 95% confidence interval (-1.23%, -0.45%).\n- The adjusted mean changes for A1C (%) from baseline over time for linagliptin and metformin as compared to linagliptin alone were maintained throughout the 24 week treatment period. Using the completers analysis the respective adjusted means for A1C (%) changes from baseline for linagliptin and metformin as compared to linagliptin alone were -1.9 and -1.3 at week 6, -2.6 and -1.8 at week 12, -2.7 and -1.9 at week 18, and -2.7 and -1.9 at week 24.\n- Changes in body weight from baseline were not clinically significant in either treatment group.\nAdd-On Combination Therapy with Metformin\nActive-Controlled Study vs Glimepiride in Combination with Metformin\n- Patients treated with linagliptin had a mean baseline body weight of 86 kg and were observed to have an adjusted mean decrease in body weight of 1.1 kg at 52 weeks and 1.4 kg at 104 weeks. Patients on glimepiride had a mean baseline body weight of 87 kg and were observed to have an adjusted mean increase from baseline in body weight of 1.4 kg at 52 weeks and 1.3 kg at 104 weeks (treatment difference p<0.0001 for both timepoints).\n- Linagliptin used in combination with insulin (with or without metformin and/or pioglitazone), provided statistically significant improvements in A1C and FPG compared to placebo  after 24 weeks of treatment. The mean total daily insulin dose at baseline was 42 units for patients treated with linagliptin and 40 units for patients treated with placebo. Background baseline diabetes therapy included use of: insulin alone (16.1%), insulin combined with metformin only (75.5%), insulin combined with metformin and pioglitazone (7.4%), and insulin combined with pioglitazone only (1%). The mean change from baseline to Week 24 in the daily dose of insulin was +1.3 IU in the placebo group and +0.6 IU in the linagliptin group. The mean change in body weight from baseline to Week 24 was similar in the two treatment groups. The rate of hypoglycemia, defined as all symptomatic or asymptomatic episodes with a self measured blood glucose was also similar in both groups (21.4% linagliptin; 22.9% placebo) in the first 24 weeks of the study.\n- The difference between treatment with linagliptin and placebo in terms of adjusted mean change from baseline in HbA1c after 24 weeks was comparable for patients with no renal impairment (eGRF ≥90 mL/min, n=539), with mild renal impairment (eGFR 60 to <90 mL/min, n=565), or with moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to <60 mL/min, n=124).\nRenal Impairment\n\n【38】 #How Supplied\n- JENTADUETO (linagliptin and metformin hydrochloride) tablets 2.5 mg/500 mg are supplied as follows:\n\n【39】 ## Storage\n- Store at 25°C (77°F); excursions permitted to 15°-30°C (59°-86°F) .

After IV infusion of 500 mg, 1 g, and 2 g doses of ceftazidime over 20 to 30 minutes to normal adult male volunteers, mean peak serum concentrations of 42, 69, and 170 mcg/mL, respectively, were achieved\nThe absorption and elimination of ceftazidime were directly proportional to the size of the dose. The half-life following IV administration was approximately 1.9 hours. Less than 10% of ceftazidime was protein bound. The degree of protein binding was independent of concentration. There was no evidence of accumulation of ceftazidime in the serum in individuals with normal renal function following multiple IV doses of 1 and 2 g every 8 hours for 10 days.\nThe presence of hepatic dysfunction had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of ceftazidime in individuals administered 2 g intravenously every 8 hours for 5 days. Therefore, a dosage adjustment from the normal recommended dosage is not required for patients with hepatic dysfunction, provided renal function is not impaired.\nApproximately 80% to 90% of an IV dose of ceftazidime is excreted unchanged by the kidneys over a 24-hour period. After the IV administration of single 500 mg or 1 g doses, approximately 50% of the dose appeared in the urine in the first 2 hours. An additional 20% was excreted between 2 and 4 hours after dosing, and approximately another 12% of the dose appeared in the urine between 4 and 8 hours later. The elimination of ceftazidime by the kidneys resulted in high therapeutic concentrations in the urine.\nThe mean renal clearance of ceftazidime was approximately 100 mL/min. The calculated plasma clearance of approximately 115 mL/min indicated nearly complete elimination of ceftazidime by the renal route. Administration of probenecid before dosing had no effect on the elimination kinetics of ceftazidime. This suggested that ceftazidime is eliminated by glomerular filtration and is not actively secreted by renal tubular mechanisms.\nSince ceftazidime is eliminated almost solely by the kidneys, its serum half-life is significantly prolonged in patients with impaired renal function\nTherapeutic concentrations of ceftazidime are achieved in the following body tissues and fluids.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Some patients had no obvious risk factors for liver disease. Patients receiving this drug should be informed by the physician of the risk and should be closely monitored.\n- The recommended starting dose of ketoconazole tablets is a single daily administration of 200 mg (one tablet). If clinical responsiveness is insufficient within the expected time, the dose of ketoconazole tablets may be increased to 400 mg (two tablets) once daily.\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Ketoconazole (oral) in adult patients.\n- Dosing Information\n- Ketoconazole (200 mg orally once daily for 30 days).\n- In small numbers of children over 2 years of age, a single daily dose of 3.3 to 6.6 mg/kg has been used. Ketoconazole tablets have not been studied in children under 2 years of age.\n- Drug Interactions\n- Coadministration of a number of CYP3A4 substrates such as dofetilide, quinidine, cisapride and pimozide is contraindicated with ketoconazole tablets. Coadministration with ketoconazole can cause elevated plasma concentrations of these drugs and may increase or prolong both therapeutic and adverse effects to such an extent that a potentially serious adverse reaction may occur. For example, increased plasma concentrations of some of these drugs can lead to QT prolongation and sometimes resulting in life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias including occurrences of Torsades de pointes, a potentially fatal arrhythmia.\n- Additionally, the following other drugs are contraindicated with ketoconazole tablets: methadone, disopyramide, dronedarone, ergot alkaloids such as dihydroergotamine, ergometrine, ergotamine, methylergometrine, irinotecan, lurasidone, oral midazolam, alprazolam, triazolam, felodipine, nisoldipine, ranolazine, tolvaptan, eplerenone, lovastatin, simvastatin and colchicine.\n- Enhanced Sedation\n- Myopathy\n- Coadministration of CYP3A4 metabolized HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors such as simvastatin, and lovastatin is contraindicated with ketoconazole tablets.\n- Ergotism\n- Liver Disease\n- The use of ketoconazole tablets is contraindicated in patients with acute or chronic liver disease.\n- Hypersensitivity\n- Ketoconazole is contraindicated in patients who have shown hypersensitivity to the drug.\n- Hepatotoxicity\n- At baseline, obtain laboratory tests (such as SGGT, alkaline phosphatase, ALT, AST, total bilirubin (TBL), Prothrombin Time (PT), International Normalization Ratio (INR), and testing for viral hepatitides). Patients should be advised against alcohol consumption while on treatment. If possible, use of other potentially hepatotoxic drugs should be avoided in patients receiving ketoconazole tablets.\n- Prompt recognition of liver injury is essential. During the course of treatment, serum ALT should be monitored weekly for the duration of treatment. If ALT values increase to a level above the upper limit of normal or 30% above baseline, or if the patient develops symptoms, ketoconazole treatment should be interrupted and a full set of liver tests should be obtained. Liver tests should be repeated to ensure normalization of values. Hepatotoxicity has been reported with restarting oral ketoconazole (rechallenge). If it is decided to restart oral ketoconazole, monitor the patient frequently to detect any recurring liver injury from the drug.\n- QT Prolongation and Drug Interactions Leading to QT Prolongation\n- Adrenal Insufficiency\n- Adrenal function should be monitored in patients with adrenal insufficiency or with borderline adrenal function and in patients under prolonged periods of stress (major surgery, intensive care, etc.).\n- Adverse Reactions Associated with Unapproved Uses\n- Anaphylaxis has been reported after the first dose. Several cases of hypersensitivity reactions including urticaria have also been reported.\n\n【1】 ## Precautions\n- Ketoconazole tablets have been demonstrated to lower serum testosterone. Once therapy with ketoconazole tablets has been discontinued, serum testosterone levels return to baseline values. Testosterone levels are impaired with doses of 800 mg per day and abolished by 1600 mg per day. Clinical manifestations of decreased testosterone concentrations may include gynecomastia, impotence and oligospermia.\n- Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.\n- The following adverse reactions were reported in clinical trials:\nAnaphylactoid reaction\nGynecomastia\nAlcohol intolerance, anorexia, hyperlipidemia, increased appetite\nInsomnia, nervousness\nHeadache, dizziness, paresthesia, somnolence\nPhotophobia\nOrthostatic hypotension\nEpistaxis\nVomiting, diarrhea, nausea, constipation, abdominal pain, abdominal pain upper, dry mouth, dysgeusia, dyspepsia, flatulence, tongue discoloration\nHepatitis, jaundice, hepatic function abnormal\nErythema multiforme, rash, dermatitis, erythema, urticaria, pruritus, alopecia, xeroderma\nMyalgia\nMenstrual disorder\nAsthenia, fatigue, hot flush, malaise, peripheral edema, pyrexia, chills\nPlatelet count decreased\nThrombocytopenia\nAllergic conditions including anaphylactic shock, anaphylactic reaction, angioneurotic edema\nAdrenocortical insufficiency\nReversible intracranial pressure increased (e.g. papilloedema, fontanelle bulging in infants)\nSerious hepatotoxicity including hepatitis cholestatic, biopsy-confirmed hepatic necrosis, cirrhosis, hepatic failure including cases resulting in transplantation or death\nAcute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, photosensitivity\nArthralgia\nErectile dysfunction; with doses higher than the recommended therapeutic dose of 200 mg or 400 mg daily, azoospermia.\n- Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. The relevance of the results from these studies in pediatric patients is unknown.\n- Drugs that May Decrease Ketoconazole Plasma Concentrations\n- Drugs that reduce the gastric acidity (e.g. acid neutralizing medicines such as aluminum hydroxide, or acid secretion suppressors such as H2-receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors) impair the absorption of ketoconazole from ketoconazole tablets. These drugs should be used with caution when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets:\nKetoconazole tablets should be administered with an acidic beverage (such as non-diet cola) upon co-treatment with drugs reducing gastric acidity.\nAcid neutralizing medicines (e.g. aluminum hydroxide) should be administered at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after the intake of ketoconazole tablets.\nUpon coadministration, the antifungal activity should be monitored and the ketoconazole tablets dose increased as deemed necessary.\n- Coadministration of ketoconazole tablets with potent enzyme inducers of CYP3A4 may decrease the bioavailability of ketoconazole to such an extent that efficacy may be reduced. Examples include:\nAntibacterials: isoniazid, rifabutin, rifampicin.\nAnticonvulsants: carbamazepine, phenytoin.\nAntivirals: efavirenz, nevirapine.\n- Potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g. antivirals such as ritonavir, ritonavir-boosted darunavir and ritonavir-boosted fosamprenavir) may increase the bioavailability of ketoconazole. These drugs should be used with caution when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets. Patients who must take ketoconazole tablets concomitantly with potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 should be monitored closely for signs or symptoms of increased or prolonged pharmacologic effects of ketoconazole, and the ketoconazole tablets dose should be decreased as deemed necessary. When appropriate, ketoconazole plasma concentrations should be measured.\n- Examples of drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased by ketoconazole presented by drug class with advice regarding coadministration with ketoconazole tablets:\n- Pregnancy Category C\n- There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Ketoconazole tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\n- Nonteratogenic Effects\n- Ketoconazole has also been found to be embryotoxic in the rat when given in the diet at doses higher than 80 mg/kg during the first trimester of gestation.\n- Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) Pregnancy Category\nThere is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Ketoconazole (oral) in women who are pregnant.\n- Oral\n- During the course of treatment, serum ALT should be monitored weekly for the duration of treatment.\nThere is limited information regarding IV Compatibility of Ketoconazole (oral) in the drug label.\n\n【2】 #Acute Overdose\n- In the event of acute accidental overdose, treatment consists of supportive and symptomatic measures. Within the first hour after ingestion, activated charcoal may be administered.\n\n【3】 #Chronic Overdose\nThere is limited information regarding Chronic Overdose of Ketoconazole (oral) in the drug label.\n- Ketoconazole blocks the synthesis of ergosterol, a key component of the fungal cell membrane, through the inhibition of cytochrome P-450 dependent enzyme lanosterol 14α-demethylase responsible for the conversion of lanosterol to ergosterol in the fungal cell membrane. This results in an accumulation of methylated sterol precursors and a depletion of ergosterol within the cell membrane thus weakening the structure and function of the fungal cell membrane.\n- Ketoconazole, USP is a white to slightly beige, odorless powder, soluble in acids, with a molecular weight of 531.44.\n- Absorption\n- Mean peak plasma concentrations of approximately 3.5 mcg/mL are reached within 1 to 2 hours, following oral administration of a single 200 mg dose taken with a meal. Oral bioavailability is maximal when the tablets are taken with a meal.\n- Absorption of ketoconazole is reduced in subjects with reduced gastric acidity, such as subjects taking medications known as acid neutralizing medicines (e.g. aluminum hydroxide) and gastric acid secretion suppressors (e.g. H2-receptor antagonists, proton pump inhibitors) or subjects with achlorhydria caused by certain diseases. Absorption of ketoconazole under fasted conditions in these subjects is increased when ketoconazole tablets are administered with an acidic beverage (such as non-diet cola). After pretreatment with omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, the bioavailability of a single 200 mg dose of ketoconazole under fasted conditions was decreased to 17% of the bioavailability of ketoconazole administered alone. When ketoconazole was administered with non-diet cola after pretreatment with omeprazole, the bioavailability was 65% of that after administration of ketoconazole alone.\n- Distribution\n- In vitro, the plasma protein binding is about 99% mainly to the albumin fraction. Ketoconazole is widely distributed into tissues; however, only a negligible proportion reaches the cerebrospinal fluid.\n- Metabolism\n- Following absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, ketoconazole is converted into several inactive metabolites. In vitro studies have shown that CYP3A4 is the major enzyme involved in the metabolism of ketoconazole. The major identified metabolic pathways are oxidation and degradation of the imidazole and piperazine rings, by hepatic microsomal enzymes. In addition, oxidative O-dealkylation and aromatic hydroxylation does occur. Ketoconazole has not been demonstrated to induce its own metabolism.\n- Elimination\n- Approximately 13% of the dose is excreted in the urine, of which 2% to 4% is unchanged drug. The major route of excretion is through the bile into the intestinal tract with about 57% being excreted in the feces.\n- Special Populations\n- Patients with Hepatic or Renal Impairment\n- Pediatric Patients\n- Limited pharmacokinetic data are available on the use of ketoconazole tablets in the pediatric population.\n- Measurable ketoconazole plasma concentrations have been observed in pre-term infants (single or daily doses of 3 to 10 mg/kg) and in pediatric patients 5 months of age and older (daily doses of 3 to 13 mg/kg) when the drug was administered as a suspension, tablet or crushed tablet. Limited data suggest that absorption may be greater when the drug is administered as a suspension compared to a crushed tablet. Conditions that raise gastric pH may lower or prevent absorption. Maximum plasma concentrations occurred 1 to 2 hours after dosing and were in the same general range as those seen in adults who received a 200 mg to 400 mg dose.\n- Electrocardiogram\n- Ketoconazole Tablets, USP are available containing 200 mg of ketoconazole, USP.\n- The 200 mg tablet is a white to off-white round, scored tablet debossed with M above the score and 261 below the score on one side of the tablet and blank on the other side. They are available as follows:\n\n【4】 - bottles of 100 tablets\n- Store at 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F).\n- Protect from moisture.\n- Dispense in a tight, light-resistant container as defined in the USP using a child-resistant closure.\n- Keep out of reach of children.\n- Patients should be instructed to report any signs and symptoms which may suggest liver dysfunction so that appropriate biochemical testing can be done. Such signs and symptoms may include unusual fatigue, anorexia, nausea and/or vomiting, abdominal pain, jaundice, dark urine or pale stools.\n- Alcohol-Ketoconazole (oral) interaction has not been established.

These organisms are considered to be of low virulence although several studies have demonstrated an association between vaginal colonization by Ureaplasma species and adverse pregnancy outcomes including perinatal morbidity and mortality. Some studies also show an association between urogenital colonization by U. urealyticum and nongonococcal urethritis in men. However, the pathogenic role of Ureaplasma urealyticum in nongonococcal urethritis is still not clear. Colonization with Ureaplasma species occur in asymptomatic and symptomatic infants and adults, and further investigations to determine the exact pathogenic role of Ureaplasma is required. There is often a medical dilemma as to whether an isolation of Ureaplasma represents a 'true' infection or 'mere' colonization. Hence, the challenge in making a decision whether medical treatment is necessary.\n\n【2】 #Historical Perspective\nT-strain mycoplasma .\n\n【3】 #Classification\nU. urealyticum was previously classified into two biotypes:\n- Biovar 1 ( parvo biovar): Ureaplasma urealyticum biovar 1 is now known as U. parvum.\n\n【4】 #Pathophysiology\nUreaplasma raises the pH of the vagina by hydrolyzing urea into carbon dioxide and ammonia, increasing the susceptibility to mixed infection with other pathogenic bacteria. These pathogens stimulate the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, leading to the recruitment of leukocytes and production of prostaglandins, which subsequently result in preterm birth. Vertical transmission of Ureaplasma has also been associated with neonatal complications such as pneumonitis, bacteremia, and meningitis, following stimulation of fetal inflammatory responses by the organism. Some studies conducted in men show there is an association between urogenital colonization by Ureaplasma urealyticum and nongonococcal urethritis, however, the pathogenic role of Ureaplasma urealyticum in nongonococcal urethritis is not clear.\n\n【5】 #Causes\nUreaplasma species are bacteria belonging to the family Mycoplasmataceae.\n\n【6】 #Differentiating Ureaplasma from other Bacteria\nThere are no specific signs and symptoms that can distinguish Ureaplasma infection from infection caused by other microorganisms. Ureaplasma species cannot be cultured on conventional culture media for most bacteria and special culture media for Mycoplasma is often needed.\n\n【7】 #Epidemiology and Demographics\nUreaplasma species colonize 40-80% of the genital tract of healthy women.  They are the most common pathogen identified in VLBW infants. Ureaplasma colonization of the respiratory tract is more common in preterm VLBW infants compared to term infants. 20-45% of VLBW infants have Ureaplasma colonization of the respiratory tract.\n\n【8】 #Risk factors\nSeveral risk factors have been identified for Ureaplasma infection such as heavy urogenital colonization in adults, multiple sexual partners, immunosuppression, and prematurity in neonates.\n\n【9】 #Natural History, Complications and Prognosis\nThe genital tract of adult men and women serve as the main reservoirs for Ureaplasma species. Pregnancy complications such as chorioamnionitis, preterm labor, and miscarriages have been associated with Ureaplasma. Neonatal complications associated with Ureaplasma include prematurity, pneumonia, pneumonitis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, respiratory distress syndrome of the newborn and sepsis. Urogenital tract infections such as nongonococcal urethritis in men have also been associated with Ureaplasma urealyticum.\n\n【10】 #History and Symptoms\nIt is important to take a history of the underlying risk factors for Ureaplasma colonization/infection. Nonspecific symptoms such as irritability, lethargy, convulsions and dyspnea can be seen in neonatal infection associated with Ureaplasma.\n\n【11】 #Physical Examination\nThere is no physical examination finding that is specific or pathognomonic for Ureaplasma infection, and a laboratory diagnosis is required.\n\n【12】 #Laboratory Findings\nUreaplasma species are diagnosed based on culture results and/or PCR.\n\n【13】 #X ray\nEarly dysplastic pulmonary changes have been observed to occur more frequently in preterm infants with Ureaplasma colonization, although a previous study suggests there are no unique radiographic changes associated with Ureaplasma.\n\n【14】 #CT\nThere are no specific CT findings associated with Ureaplasma colonization or infection.\n\n【15】 #Other Diagnostic Studies\nMicrobial culture methods and/or PCR-based techniques are the only reliable methods for diagnosing Ureaplasma colonization/infection.\n\n【16】 #Medical Therapy\nAntibiotics are the mainstay of treatment for Ureaplasma infection, and antibiotic susceptibility testing is advised prior to treatment due to geographical differences in antibiotic resistance pattern. Doxycycline is recommended as the drug of first choice in non-pregnant women and adults. Josamycin is often recommended for neonates and pregnant women, especially when mixed infection is present. Clarithromycin and pristinamycin are also effective for treating Ureaplasma infection.\n\n【17】 #Prevention\nThere are no guidelines for the prevention of Ureaplasma colonization or infection.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "0d9cfc92-3a4e-40f7-a07a-7ec1918d3a81", "title": null, "text": "【0】 #i. Executive Summary\nThis report contains 16 guidelines and six procedures for implementing the CDC/ATSDR Policy on Releasing and Sharing Data 9 pertaining to CDC's re-release of State-provided data. The guidelines and procedures in this report have been specifically prepared to address the policies and practices that CDC programs establish for re-release of State-provided data that are not already covered by a written formal data re-release procedure at the time this report is finalized.\nThis guideline also acknowledges that in some CDC programs, States currently release data to CDC in the absence of explicit data agreements, and a process is necessary to develop these agreements even as data sharing continues The nature of confidentiality protection, a suggested content element of the data re-release plan , is based on guidelines on existing confidentiality standards and procedures .\nThese descriptions are meant to help facilitate CDC's adoption of the guidelines and likely will merit more discussion and consideration within CDC.\nWhile this document was developed for CDC data systems having specific characteristics , selected information in this document may be applicable for any CDC program that releases or shares data. However, this determination is left to the judgment of the CDC CIOs and their respective programs.\n\n【1】 #Background and Purpose\nStates + have a long-standing history of voluntarily reporting individually identifiable data to CDC on incident conditions or diseases that are of public health importance 1 . Recent developments in telecommunications and computerization have greatly enhanced the ability to compile and share such public health data. While the electronic exchange and accumulation of data on individual cases promises public health benefits, it has the potential to threaten individual privacy. The challenge is to balance the need for data protection with another competing interest of public health-the need to share data collected in the interest of public health as broadly as possible, with appropriate protections, with public health practitioners and with researchers conducting studies that have the potential to benefit public health. If such a balance is not achieved, potential data providers may choose to withhold data to protect it 2 . The U.S,S. States and Territories. identifiable data. Therefore, States are ultimately responsible for confidentiality protections, regardless of whether the data reside temporarily with a data steward, such as CDC, or reside within their own agencies.\nSince the mid-1980s, the CDC and Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) have been engaged in extensive discussions over issues related to re-release by CDC of data released by States to CDC. States wanted assurance that CDC programs would apply consistent principles and adhere to certain standards when releasing such data\nCDC has a responsibility to ensure that CDC programs protect the confidentiality of the State-provided data they have been entrusted with, and inform CSTE and data providers how the confidentiality of this data is being protected. In addition, CDC and CSTE have a shared responsibility to develop feasible guidelines for CDC programs that are consistent with State laws, regulations, and policies protecting confidentiality and that reflect state-of-the-art or best practices 3,4,5,6 .\nThese guidelines are consistent with and expand upon the requirements listed in the CDC/ATSDR Policy for Releasing and Sharing Data 9 . A key principle of this report is the need for CDC programs to develop data agreements with State data providers before the data are received by CDC. The report also recognizes that in some CDC programs, States currently release data to CDC in the absence of explicit data agreements, and a process is necessary to develop these agreements even as data sharing continues. To facilitate this process, CDC programs will develop data re-release plans based on accepted data release practices and procedures as well as scientifically acceptable principles for confidentiality protection. Prior to finalization, draft CDC programspecific data release plans will be shared with data providers for their input. Formal agreement for each data re-release plan will be obtained from the data providers through an opt-in or opt-out \"statement of response\" from the data providers. For data providers deciding to opt-out of the data release plan, further negotiation with the data providers will be needed to customize the plan to meet State requirements. Data collected by CDC, including data collected by States and provided to CDC, becomes Federal record once received by CDC, and is subject to Federal laws and rules governing data release and Federal records retention laws. These include, but are not limited to, the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), the Privacy Act of 1974, Confidentiality Assurances and Certificates of Confidentiality . These laws, which are highlighted in Appendices B1 (Federal Laws and Rules Governing Data Release) and B2 (overview of selected Federal laws), may provide CDC with the ability to protect certain types of data from public re-disclosure; they also may require the retention and/or disclosure of data in some circumstances. Data use agreements must conform to the requirements of these laws when applicable.\n\n【2】 #What Type of Data do the CDC-ATSDR Data Release Guidelines and Procedures Apply to?\nThe CDC-ATSDR Data Release Guidelines and Procedures for Re-release of State-Provided Data contain information that may be applicable for any CDC program that releases or shares data; however, it has been prepared specifically to address the policies and practices CDC programs establish for State-provided data shared with CDC that are not already covered by a written formal data re-release procedure at the time this report is finalized. State-provided data are defined, in this report, as population-based data intended to represent a complete count of cases (or a statistical sample of all cases in a given population) that are collected by U.S. State and Territorial Health Agencies related to the health or exposure status of individual U.S. residents, which fall under State legal authority for collection and protection of privacy and confidentiality, and that are reported to CDC by State health departments. The Guidelines and Procedures also apply to unweighted microdata 10,11 (individual person records) from sample surveys administered by State Health Agencies which send CDC data containing personal identifiers or information about survey respondents that could potentially be used to identify survey respondents. Furthermore, these data release guidelines and procedures apply to State-provided surveillance and information data about events (such as a chemical spill or conflagration, etc.) only if data has been provided by the State in the format of individual person records associated with the event .\n\n【3】 #Data from Indian Tribal nations that comes to CDC indirectly through State Health\nAgencies are covered by the guidelines and procedures in this report because these data are being directly reported to CDC under the authority of the State Health Agency. For CDC public health surveillance systems which are comprised of data from State Health Agencies and other data sources, such as the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System, one data release procedure should be developed and that procedure should not be in conflict with the data release guidelines for State-provided data.\nAlthough most of the guidelines are applicable for any data that are released or shared, data not specifically covered by the CDC-ATSDR Data Release Guidelines and Procedures for Re-Release of State-Provided Data include, but are not limited to, the following:\n- individually identifiable data that are not collected under U.S. State health agency authority, such as data that CDC collects directly, and data that are reported directly to CDC by Indian Tribal nations;\n- data collected specifically for research or an outbreak investigation;\n- data systems that use public-use data compiled from another data system considered to be the primary data system.\n\n【4】 #A. Introduction\nEach guideline represents a \"minimum standard\" for CDC programs to address when developing their program-specific data release procedures for re-release of State-provided data. CDC programs may wish to adopt more stringent standards than the minimum standard.\nBest practices statements accompany most of the guidelines On occasion, more than one best practices standard is shown because they may represent viable alternative options for specific CDC programs. The best practices statements differ from the guidelines, in that the best practices statements are not minimum standards, but rather a listing of approaches that may merit more discussion and consideration within CDC. The best practices statements are meant to be descriptive rather than prescriptive. In other words, it is being left to the discretion of each CDC program to consider for themselves whether it is appropriate to implement the listed best practices statements or implement another approach to meet the intent of the guideline.\nBecause CDC data systems vary widely with respect to their content and format, it is important that both the guidelines and best practices allow for flexibility within the context of the principles espoused by the CDC policy.\n\n【5】 There may be some aspects of the data re-release plan that may need to be deferred until the data are reviewed by the CDC program. In this situation, a short-term (and most likely brief) data re-release plan could be drafted in collaboration with the State data providers prior to the time CDC receives the data and then a more comprehensive longerterm data re-release plan developed after the CDC program has reviewed the data. The short-term plan could simply remind the State data providers about any assurances and approvals that are in place to protect the data, if any, and inform them that no data, or very limited data, will be re-released before the longer-term plan is developed . The short-term initial data agreement with State data providers should specify the expected time the initial plan will remain in place as well as the number of months the CDC program anticipates it will take to complete the longer-term more comprehensive data re-release plan in collaboration with State data providers. CDC programs will solicit the State data provider's input and formal agreement with the proposed data re-release plan by asking the data providers for a formal \"statement of response,\" which at a minimum should include the State's decision to either \"opt-in\" or \"opt-out\" of the plan or components of the plan (e.g. a State may want to include their data in a CDC program's re-release of public-use data, but not restricted-access data).\nThe CDC program may want to customize the proposed data re-release plan for State data providers wishing to opt-out of the plan because it does not offer adequate protection for their State's data. For example, if feasible, the CDC program could withhold re-release of data below a specific sub-state geographic level for some States. While States have the option to refrain from providing data to CDC if the CDC plan provides less protection than State requirements, this should be a very rare occurrence that is only used as a last resort option by the State. The CDC program will review and, if necessary, update the data release plan periodically, and will notify States whenever a change in procedure is anticipated.\nBest practices for Guideline 1: The NCHS and NAPHSIS have an agreed upon data re-release agreement for vital statistics data.\nThis process enabled CDC to customize the AIDS data re-release procedure to meet the different requirements of individual States.\n\n【6】 #Guideline 2: Suggested Content of the Data Re-Release Plan\nThe content of the data re-release plan will vary according to the needs of the CDC program and data providers.  - For CDC and State and local public health employees, permission for use of restricted-access data sets will be limited to those employees having official programmatic duties warranting access to these data.\n- For other data requestors, permission for use of restricted-access data will be based upon a review of the stated purpose of the data request (the stated purpose of the data request should be consistent with the original purpose for data collection), an assessment of whether the requested data would be appropriate to use for the intended purpose, and the need for using restricted-access data versus another type of available data set (e.g. a PUDS).\nThe CDC/ATSDR Policy on Releasing and Sharing Data states: \"CDC strives to have data release policies that are fair to all users, regardless of their organizational affiliation.\"\nCDC programs should develop a procedure describing the criteria for determining who can access non-PUDS (i.e. restricted-access) data and the party or parties within CDC who are responsible for making these decisions. Procedures for releasing restrictedaccess data include authenticating the requestor's identity  and the use of data sharing agreements (DSA) .\nBest practices for Guideline 5:\n\n【7】 Guideline 6: Include Disclaimer with Re-Release of Provisional Data 'Provisional' or 'preliminary' data are thought to be close to final but subject to change as additional records are added to the dataset or updated information is obtained. The exact definition of 'provisional' or 'preliminary' varies by data system. Because provisional data may be subject to substantial change, it may not be appropriate for these data to be used for all purposes for which finalized data are used. The CDC program will inform State data providers of their procedure for any proposed re-release of provisional public-use and restricted-access data and States, in turn, will indicate their agreement or disagreement with the re-release procedure via their \"statement of response\" . A \"Provisional Data Disclaimer\" should accompany provisional data rereleases. It should encourage the data user to consider the provisional nature of the data before using it for decisions. In addition, the disclaimer should describe how the data are reviewed to ensure accuracy, and when the data are considered finalized.\nExplicit criteria for data finalization should be documented and include adequate time for corrections from data providers and for case investigation to establish final case classification.\n\n【8】 #Guideline 7: Maintain Log of Data Sets Re-Released\nThe CDC program which re-releases State-provided data will maintain a log of data sets released.\nBest practices for Guideline 7: For PUDS data, the log of data sets released represents an inventory of the different PUDS data sets CDC has released. Ideally, such an inventory would be posted on the Internet, include a description of all State-provided PUDS public health surveillance data released by CDC, and be formatted so it can be queried by users Thus, the inventory should prompt CDC programs to perform disclosure risk assessment within the context of all previously released related data sets. Minimum data elements for the PUDS inventory could include the date the PUDS was first released, conditions or diseases included in the data set, variables and coding formats contained within the PUDS, and information on how to request the PUDS. If more than one PUDS data set is released by a single CDC program, the program should clarify how their PUDS data sets are different.\nFor restricted-access data, the primary purpose of the log of releases is to be able to track the status and terms of each data sharing agreement (DSA). This log is for internal CDC use by the CDC program responsible for tracking compliance with the terms of the DSA. Ideally, such a log would be posted on the CDC Intranet. The log of releases for restricted-access data sets should be audited to assess whether the person or persons granted access to restricted-access data are complying with the terms of their DSA. Minimum elements for the restricted-access log may include name and affiliation of the person responsible for compliance with the terms of the DSA and information on how to contact them, names of all collaborators on the project (and information on how to contact them), the list of variables and coding formats released, the name of the conditions or diseases represented by the data, and a checklist of requirements the CDC program needs to verify as per the DSA (For example, if a pre-publication review of the report was required by the DSA, the date the data user sent the report to CDC for review and the date the review was completed and comments sent to the data user; or, the date the data set was returned to CDC or destroyed, etc.).\n\n【9】 #B. Re-release of State-Provided Data as Public-Use Data\nCDC's re-release of data as a PUDS does not require the use of a DSA. When PUDS are created by CDC programs, they should be made available to all interested users, without restrictions.\n\n【10】 #Guideline 8: Planning for Release of Public-Use Data\nThis Policy indicates \"procedures for releasing publicuse data should be consistent with the CDC's Public Health Information Network's functions and specifications 15 .\" The CDC/ATSDR Policy indicates each plan for release of public-use data should include the following:\n- A procedure to ensure that confidential information is not disclosed.\n- Analysis plans and other documentation required by the Office of Management and Budget regulation on data quality 16 .\n- Instructions for non-CDC users on the appropriate use of the data.\n- The date the data will be released, which should be as soon as possible after the data are collected, scrutinized for errors and validated. The release of these data should occur no more than one year after these activities are completed.\n- The formats in which the data will be released (e.g. ASCII). For each format, give specifications (e.g. variable definitions) and information on standards for transmission.\n\n【11】 #Guideline 9: Include Disclosure Statement with PUDS\nAt the time each PUDS is released or accessed, CDC programs will include a written statement about the following responsibilities users of public-use data have:\n- A statement informing PUDS users of their responsibility to maintain confidentiality, including (per the CDC/ATSDR Policy on Releasing and Sharing Data 9 ), \"instructions that non-CDC data users must agree not to link data with other data sets… … instructions to report to the CDC ADS any inadvertent discovery of the identity of any person and to make no use of that discovery.\"\nBest practices for Guideline 9: CDC NCHS requests that PUDS users agree to:\n- \"Use the data in this dataset for statistical reporting and analysis only. Best practices for Guideline 10: Following are examples.\n- Written requests for access to State-provided data are required to be on letterhead stationery. - Oral or email requests from a known individual are considered as needing no further verification. An electronic authentication protocol can use one or more of the following methods.\n- Software access control: Password or challenge phrase; Digital certificate - Physical device: Hardware \"token\" (e.g. USB connection); Digital fob (auto-generated passnumber); SmartCard - Biometric scan The electronic process for identification-authentication can be linked to authorization \"rights\" which specify levels of access.\n\n【12】 #Guideline 11: All Requestors Wanting to Use Restricted-Access Data are Required to Sign a DSA\nThe CDC program should confirm, via the \"statement of response\"  that the State granted permission for the data to be re-released as a restricted-access data file.\nIn addition, prior to CDC's re-release of these data, all requestors must sign a DSA which governs the protection and use of these data. The CDC program which re-releases Stateprovided data will retain signed copies of the DSA. A DSA may be subsumed in a larger interagency Memorandum of Understanding (MOU).\nBest practices for Guideline 11: The 2002 modification to the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits release of a \"limited data set\" as long as a there is a written data use agreement\n\n【13】 #Guideline 12: Monitor User Compliance with DSAs\nThe CDC program which re-releases State-provided data will monitor compliance with the terms of the DSA.\nBest practices for Guideline 12: A passive approach to compliance monitoring is acceptable, as long as the following criteria are met:\n- The data user is informed of the penalty for not complying with the terms of the DSA. (The intent of the penalty is to deter breaches in compliance.) - The data user is fully informed about their responsibilities in using the data. - The data steward institutes a process for logging compliance problems they become aware of. - The CDC program takes appropriate actions to resolve any identified problems and implements (if possible) procedures to avoid similar types of problems in the future.\nExamples of active compliance monitoring methods include:\n- Pre-publication review of reports, articles, graphs, maps, or tables. - Prior review of presentations based on the dataset.\n- Annual letters sent by data stewards to confirm whether the data requestor's use of the dataset has been completed and whether the data requestor has taken steps to either destroy or return the dataset.\nPre-publication or pre-presentation review can include both privacy protection as well as accuracy of scientific inferences. Releasing and Sharing Data 9 for \"special-use agreements,\" but also includes additional criteria:\n\n【14】 #C2. Development of Data Sharing Agreements for Restricted-Access Data - A description of the use to which the data will be put, and limitations on usage of data. The data requestor's description of their intended use of the data should provide evidence to the CDC program that there is a legitimate public health purpose that justifies the use of the data. The data user should also demonstrate their need for restricted-access data versus other available data, such as a PUDS.\n- Information on any laws pertaining to the DSA.\n- The names of every person who will have access to the data and specification of procedures for extending the provisions of the DSA to named collaborators (e.g. requiring signed confidentiality pledges, etc).\n- A list of mechanisms for preservation of confidentiality. These mechanisms should include both limitations on access (i.e. specified staff only) and technical security practices (such as encryption).\n- A list of restrictions on releasing analytic results.\n- A clearly stated prohibition on any attempt to link the dataset with any other dataset without prior CDC permission .\n- Provisions that govern emergency requests for identifiable or otherwise confidential data .\n- For DSAs with CDC staff acting as a data user, the following are to be included in the DSA:\nThe CDC program interested in re-releasing restricted-access data for a linked data analysis should obtain, or require the data requestor to obtain, written permission from the data providers (the States contributing the data) for the proposed linked analysis.\nPrior to seeking permission from the data providers, the data requestor should complete and sign the standard DSA  and, in addition, attach an addendum to the DSA which includes the following information, so the CDC program and data providers can determine whether to approve the data request: 1 source and description of the data file to which the restricted-access data will be linked; 2 written description of the variables and coding formats to be included in the final linked file; and 3 description of the data requestor's plan for conducting additional disclosure review to ensure that variables contributed in the linking process do not lead to re-identification of the individual described in the original data file.\nBest practices for Guideline 14: Examples of special procedures for linked analyses are:\n- \"separation of duties\", where no single individual is able to conduct all of the steps in the linkage process. - post-linkage de-identification. Standard de-identification methods should be used, such as numerator and denominator cell aggregation or suppression rules.\n\n【15】 Linkage can be conducted inside a CDC-controlled data center. This guideline applies to \"modified\" data shared outside of such centers. Data shared outside CDC-controlled data centers are partially or substantially modified, as needed, in order to minimize the likelihood of breaches of confidentiality.\n\n【16】 #Other Parties\nRestricted-access data can be released further to other parties as de-identified data, in one of two ways: 1 by creating a de-identified data set (i.e. a PUDS) from the restrictedaccess data set and then disseminating data from the PUDS, or 2 by generating deidentified data directly from the restricted-access data set (where the restricted-access data file, by definition, includes identifiable or potentially identifiable data).\nIf the requestor plans to release de-identified data generated directly from a restrictedaccess data file (situation\n\n【17】 # described above), a procedure must be implemented to ensure that the generated data have been de-identified appropriately. In this situation, the data requestor is required to submit an addendum to the standard DSA  describing the procedures that will be implemented to audit the results of the data generated for further release to other parties.\nBest practices for Guideline 15: If the requestor plans release via an online interactive query system which generates tables from restricted data, an automated algorithm for de-identification must act prior to release, and its results must be checked by an automated audit protocol. An automated audit protocol assesses disclosure risk against pre-determined thresholds, However, the HIPAA Privacy Rule's \"safe harbor\" method of de-identification is deemed inadequate protection for public health agencies to use for de-identifying data sets because public health agencies collect many more demographic variables than do covered health entities.\n\n【18】 #D. Confidentiality Protection\nIn addition, public health agencies are expected to have a much higher level of sophistication with regard to disclosure review than entities covered by HIPAA.\nOther useful materials on confidentiality protection have been developed and will be useful to those involved in data protection and re-release, including a book published in\n\n【19】 #B. Procedures for Implementing Confidentiality Protection\nThe following is a list of procedures for confidentiality protection. One or more of these procedures may be appropriate for a given data system. It is not the intention of this report to imply that all these methods need to be used for each data system\n\n【20】 #Procedure 1. Limit Disclosure of Potential Identifiers\nThe CDC programs that re-release State-provided data will delete, as necessary, all information judged to be of potential use in making individuals to whom they pertain \"identifiable\" . Particular attention will be devoted to information that can lead directly to an individual or their family, such as:\n- Name - Street address - Social Security Number - Medical record number - Telephone number\n\n【21】 #Geographic Information\n- Zip code (9-, 5-, and even 3-digit)\n- Census tract\n- City/town - County\n\n【22】 #Timing of events\n- Exact date of birth (year-month-day)\n- Month and year of birth (year-month)\nInformation concerning location ,e.g.\n- Occupation (e.g. 3-or higher digit codes)\n- Education (e.g. single years)\n- Race/ethnicity (e.g. Aleutian, Filipino v. Asian)\n- Income (as a continuous, un-topcoded variable)\n- Medical condition/diagnosis (e.gg. 3-or higher digit ICD code)\nThere could be other program-specific variables that may be used to help disclose individual identity.\nPrior to re-release, these items must be thoroughly reviewed for their potential for personal re-identification. It is not the intent of these guidelines to imply that all of these fields must always be deleted. Under appropriate conditions and with proper safeguards, such items may be released. It is not the intent of these guidelines to recommend a single strategy for the limitation of disclosure risk. It is recognized that both programmatic and statistical considerations may come into play in deciding appropriate protections for data release. For example, an alternative to field (variable) deletion is data value recoding .\nBest\nThe HIPAA Privacy Rule de-identification standard that is consistent with this guideline requires \"a person with appropriate knowledge and experience applying generally acceptable statistical and scientific principles and methods for rendering information not individually identifiable makes and documents a determination that there is a very small risk that the information could be used by others to identify a subject of the information\" (45 CFR Part 164.514(b)(i)).\nIn addition, the limited data set may include 5-digit zip code or any other geographic subdivisions, such as State, county, city, precinct and their equivalent geocodes, except for street address. The Privacy Rule clarifies standards for the creation of deidentified data sets and \"limited data sets.\" The limited data set concept is consistent with the concept of \"restricted-access\" data that is discussed in this report.\n\n【23】 #Procedure 2. Aggregate Data Values\nThe CDC programs which re-release State-provided data, either as \"microdata\" files (e.g. data files or records on an individual person) or as tabular data, will recode fields as needed in order to aggregate data values. Common methods include:\n- collapsing continuous/interval data (e.g. age; date of occurrence) into broad categories;\n- grouping nominal data (e.g. diagnosis) into broad categories;\n- truncating variables (e.g. name).\n- top-coding or bottom-coding variables.\n\n【24】 #Procedure 3. Limit the Number of Records or the Number of Fields\nThe CDC program which re-releases State-provided data as \"microdata\" files will consider the applicability of other methods to protect microdata releases from disclosure risk. Common methods include:\n- including data from only a sample of the full dataset;\n- limiting the number of variables in the released file. For example, consider\nreleasing only those variables essential to analysis; and  limiting the number of contextual or ecological variables--information that describes a geographic area, such as where a case-patient resides--because this type of information can lead to the identification of that area.\n\n【25】 #Procedure 4. Use Numerator Rules for Data Aggregation or Suppression\nThe CDC program which re-releases State-provided data as tabular data or microdata will use numerator rules (cell size) to either\n\n【26】 There is no single numeric threshold for cell aggregation that is appropriate for all data in tabular or microdata format. Selection of an appropriate threshold level is guided by multiple factors, including:\n- sensitivity of the data (subject matter);\n- format of the data (e.g. whether the data are continuous or categorical);\n\n【27】 - likelihood that a specific record in a database may represent a unique person in a small population;\n- population or subgroup denominator size, as well as the numerator size. The CDC staff manual on confidentiality 7 generally advises a minimum numerator cell size of \"3\". Thus, numerator cell size counts of \"1\" or \"2\" are not generally advised, with some notable exceptions.\nThe CDC staff manual on confidentiality 7 indicates the following exceptions to minimum numerator cell size rule of \"3\": a \"It has been a longstanding tradition in the field of morbidity or mortality  statistics not to suppress small frequency cells in the tabulation and presentation of data. For example, it has been considered important to know that there were two deaths from rabies in Rio Arriba County, N. Mex. in a given year, or that there were only one infant death and two fetal deaths in Aitkin County, Minn. These types of exceptions to general CDC practices in other programs are followed because they have been accepted traditionally and because they rarely, if ever, reveal information about individuals that is not known socially\"\nThe Washington State guideline states: \"If the count of cases or events in a cell is less than three, the data analyst needs to consider whether a breach of confidentiality is likely. A count of no events in the cell is clearly no threat to confidentiality, but a count of one or two events may be.\nA rule which combines numerators and denominators will meet this standard, such as a rule that data are not released if the population is less than a certain size and the number of events in a cell is less than a certain size However, precise methods for automated suppression and auditing, that are easily implemented, still need to be developed. Therefore, at this time, it is not possible to implement this \"best practice,\" but it should be considered for future implementation.\n\n【28】 #Procedure 5. Use Denominator Rules for Data Aggregation or Suppression\nThe CDC programs which re-release State-provided data as tabular data or microdata will use denominator rules (population size) to either:\n\n【29】 Best practices for Procedure 5: A rule which combines numerators and denominators will meet this standard, such as a rule that addresses the relationship between the size of the numerator and the size of the denominator.\nAn approach commonly used for microdata is that data are not released if the total population from which the data are drawn is less than a certain size, based on the premise of a size sufficiently large that no subcell of the variables contained in the data would be expected to be smaller than a certain size.\nIn considering the population size in tabulated data, guidelines employed by the Washington State Department of Health state that \"Generally, tabular data based on denominators greater than 300 persons per cell present minimal risk for individual identification, Caution should be exercised by the analyst if the population size is between 100 and 300, and extreme caution is warranted when the population is less than 100.\nAs indicated in Procedure 4 above, in the case of tabulated data Missouri focuses on the number of people in the population with the characteristic indicated in a given numerator. If the difference between the two is less than a minimum number, this information is not be published. On the other hand, in this scheme a very small cell number could be published if the denominator were large enough.\nWith regard to total population size, the statistical literature contains a great deal of discussion of appropriate minimal sizes and there is clearly variation depending upon information content and special considerations\nThe Federal Committee on Statistical Methodology's Confidentiality and Data Access Committee Checklist on Disclosure Potential of Proposed Data Releases 6 calls for \"a minimum of 100,000 persons in the sampled area …  provide rationale.\nGeneral Rule: All geographic areas that are identified must have a minimum of 100,000 persons in the sampled area (according to latest Census or Census estimate) For certain target populations the members of which are be found infrequently in a population, a higher number may be desired.\"\n\n【30】 #Procedure 6. Refrain From Using Techniques that Distort Data for Privacy Protection\nThe CDC programs which re-release State-provided data will refrain from distorting data (either altering data values or omitting records from the dataset) unless this approach is employed as a last resort and is absolutely necessary for the purpose of privacy protection.\nBest practices for Procedure 6: Examples of distorting data include adding statistical noise, data swapping, blanking and imputing for randomly selected records, and blurring data (replacing a reported value by an average value) Alternatively, researchers should be provided the opportunity to obtain restricted-access data under a data sharing agreement, or conduct re-analysis themselves in a CDC-controlled research data center.\nalso Practice G which mentions that a new form of disclosure limitation, entitled \"controlled tabular adjustment,\" is being researched; software is being developed to implement this new method. It was beyond the scope of this report to assess which data distortion methods minimize the magnitude of data distortion.\n\n【31】 #B. Development of a Data Set Inventory to Facilitate Disclosure Risk Assessment\nDisclosure risk assessment is performed to estimate, either qualitatively or quantitatively, the probability that a data set poses a high or low risk of re-identification in terms of the information it contains about individuals and the status of their health. Since the risk of re-identification may be increased if a one data set can be linked to an another data set, CDC data stewards should be aware of the data sets other CDC components release that could have the potential for linkage with data sets their own programs release. To help facilitate this aspect of disclosure risk assessment, CDC should compile and regularly update an inventory of data sets that have already been released and that are eligible for release in the near future. The inventory should be posted on the CDC Intranet in a browsable (or queriable) format and should include, for each data set, the name of the CDC program releasing the data set, data steward contact information, and data set documentation , including the names of diseases or conditions about which the data are tabulated , and the variables and coding formats used.\n\n【32】 #Occurred\nThis report and the CDC/ATSDR Policy on Releasing and Sharing Data states that potential confidentiality breaches should be reported to the CDC ADS. This passive approach to ascertaining potential confidentiality breaches assumes that CDC will receive such reports. CDC should consider the feasibility of taking a more active approach to identifying confidentiality breaches. If feasible to do so, CDC may wish to itself develop or contract with others to develop standard criteria for CDC programs to use in conducting active approaches.\n\n【33】 #Disclosure Risk Assessment\nThis report is not intended to be (and cannot be) a comprehensive resource on confidentiality protection or disclosure risk assessment and control. CDC programs may need to consult with experts on these issues as they develop program-specific data rerelease procedures that are consistent with guidelines and procedures in this report. CDC may wish to generally offer their programs the services of specified experts on these issues. In addition, CDC may wish to develop an interest group forum on confidentiality and data release patterned after the Confidentiality and Data Access Committee (CDAC).\n\n【34】 #Report, from Various Websites, Are Archived\nThis report cites various materials that are currently posted on the Internet pertaining to \"training\" issues, such as data release policies, confidentiality protection, or disclosure review assessment that would be useful to preserve for use with this report. To preserve the future availability of these materials, CDC should consider creating an Intranet site where these materials are archived.\n\n【35】 #Disclosure Risk, and Other Issues\nThe adoption of these guidelines should not deter CDC, CSTE, and others from future discussions of new methods for privacy protection and disclosure risk assessment and review. The guidelines and procedures are not \"written in stone\" and should be considered subject to change as new information and methods become available In addition, the Working Group was not aware of any algorithms being used by health agencies for automated suppression and auditing of one or more related tables\nBecause use of web-based interactive query systems for data dissemination is increasing, future discussions should focus on the development and use of automated suppression and auditing methodologies for use by CDC programs.\nIn 2002, the NCHS Office of Research and Methodology (ORM) sponsored the development of methodologic software for complementary cell suppression (and controlled rounding and controlled random perturbation) in two-way statistical tables of counts or magnitudes. CDC may wish to explore these automated methods for complementary cell suppression which are statistically-based in lieu of using ad-hoc or manual approaches.\nThe NCHS ORM also noted that research is underway for a new form of disclosure limitation in tables called \"controlled tabular adjustment,\" which is not limited by the dimensionality or complexity of tables. While Procedure 6 indicates CDC programs should refrain from using disclosure limitation techniques that distort data, it may be useful for CDC to assess or contract with others to assess which of the various perturbative statistical disclosure control methods minimize the magnitude of data distortion, for potential use by public health systems.\nSince CDC program data stewards will most likely be the primary staff responsible for writing program-specific procedures, under the direction of the CIO data-release review board or another oversight mechanism, CDC may wish to consider establishing a cross-CIO forum for data stewards to brainstorm and share suggestions for implementing the CDC-ATSDR Data Release Guidelines and Procedures for Re-Release of State-Provided Data.\nVarious issues were raised during the review of this document that the DRGWG did not address, but that merit future discussion, including the following concerns and issues that were expressed:\n- CDC may fail to inform data users of potential weaknesses or peculiarities of the data when it releases the data, while the State may have provided such information to the user.\n- CDC may re-release data containing uncorrected errors, while the State may have released the same data with corrections. More generally, data rereleased by CDC may not be exactly the same as the corresponding dataset held by the State, and the user would not be informed of this possibility.\n- CDC collects and uses data from various State agencies other than State health agencies, such as labor departments, environmental departments, and agriculture departments. These other sources of data were not included within the scope of the CDC-ATSDR Data Release Guidelines and Procedures for Re-release of State-Provided Data because of the way the Data Release Guidelines Working Group was constituted. Future discussions within CDC should focus on whether the implementation guidelines for the CDC-ATSDR Policy for Releasing and Sharing Data in this report should also apply to data from State agencies other than State health agencies.\n- State-provided data that comes to CDC from other Federal agencies and not directly from State health agencies are not considered within the scope of the\n\n【36】 #CDC-ATSDR Data Release Guidelines and Procedures for Re-release of\nState-Provided Data. Each request for this type of data may need to be handled differently, depending on the specifics of the situation, such as whether an MOU or other written agreement exists between the two Federal agencies or other statutory protections exist that define how external requests for data will be handled. In addition, for FOIA requests, an assessment may be needed to identify whether any FOIA exemptions may apply or whether the situation warrants a referral by the FOIA Officer to the Federal agency which was the source of the data being sent to CDC. Future discussions within CDC should focus on efficient processes for handling these types of data requests.\n\n【37】 #Guidelines and Procedures\nCDC and ATSDR programs having surveillance systems that fall within the scope of the CDC-ATSDR data release guidelines and procedures should examine their data re-release practices as of the effective date of the CDC-ATSDR Data Release Guidelines and Procedures for Re-release of State-Provided Data to see if they meet the minimum standards. If their procedures do not meet the minimum standards, CDC programs should have two years to revise their procedures to bring them into conformance, unless an appeal for an extension is requested from and granted by the CDC ADS. CDC CIOs should be responsible for ensuring that the guidelines and procedures are implemented either through the establishment of a CIO data-release review board , which might report to the CIO ADS and might include the CIO Information Resources Manager and relevant data stewards, or CIOs might wish to implement the policy using an alternative oversight mechanism.\nThe OPS Announcement that is distributed after the CDC-ATSDR Data Release Guidelines and Procedures for Re-release of State-Provided Data are cleared by CDC should indicate the guidelines apply to data shared between the States and CDC that are not already covered by a formal written data re-release procedure. CDC programs should examine their practices, as of the distribution date, to see if they meet the minimum standards in guidelines, and if not, to revise them to bring them into conformance with the minimum standard guidelines. CDC program data re-release procedures should be forwarded to the CDC ADS Office where an assessment of conformance with the CDC-ATSDR Data Release Guidelines and Procedures for Rerelease of State-Provided Data will be done.\n\n【38】 #Feedback to CSTE Regarding CDC's Implementation of the Guidelines\nCDC should advise CSTE on at least an annual basis during the implementation phase of these guidelines, on the status of completion of implementation. In addition, CDC should communicate with CSTE regularly regarding the results of evaluations conducted after the guidelines and procedures have been implemented by CDC programs, particularly if the results of the evaluations indicate that a revision of the guidelines is warranted.\n\n【39】 #CIO\nPrimary Representative Alternate Representative importance of the work undertaken by the DRGWG and for allowing their staff to dedicate time and resources to this effort.\n\n【40】 #Glossary\nAudit trail: The maintenance of information, in a logbook or database, pertaining the request for and release and use of individually identifiable data.\n\n【41】 #Authentication:\nThe process by which the identity of a person requesting access to individually identifiable data (restricted-access data) is verified.\n\n【42】 #Automated audit protocol:\nIn terms of disclosure risk control, the use of linear programming to identify complementary cell suppressions for a primary cell suppression and to audit the proposed cell suppression pattern to see if it provides the required level of protection. Research seems to indicate that linear programming methodologies provide good but not optimal results. For this reason, it is not enough to just perform an automated audit for secondary cell suppression. The result of the algorithm needs to be checked to see if it is successful.\n\n【43】 #Bottom-coding:\nA technique used to mask microdata that involves creating categories for data values that are below a certain level. This method differs from aggregation, in that all data values below a certain threshold are grouped; other values in the field may or may not be grouped.  top-coding.\nCell suppression: One of the most commonly used ways of protecting sensitive cells in tabular data. It is obvious that in a row with a suppressed sensitive cell, at least one additional cell must be suppressed, or the value in the sensitive cell could be calculated exactly by subtraction from the marginal total. The same is true for the column which contains a suppressed cell. For this reason, certain other cells must also be suppressed.\nThe suppression of a sensitive cell is termed a primary cell suppression. Suppression of other cells to prevent one from calculating the value in the sensitive cell is termed complementary (or secondary) cell suppression.\n\n【44】 #Computational disclosure control:\nThe process by which data values are aggregated to increase the granularity of specific variables, such as grouping age into age groups prior to data release.\n\n【45】 #Confidentiality:\nThe treatment of information that an individual or institution has disclosed in a relationship of trust, with the expectation that it will not be divulged to others in ways that are inconsistent with the understanding of the original disclosure. It encompasses access to and disclosure of information in accordance with requirements of law and/or official policy 26 .\nConfidentiality breach: \"An unauthorized release of identifiable or confidential data or information, which may result from a security failure, intentional inappropriate behavior, human error, or natural disaster. A breach of confidentiality may or may not result in harm to one or more individuals.\nDisclosure: In this report, disclosure refers to the unauthorized public disclosure of information about a person, about which data have been collected. A disclosure may occur as a result of a confidentiality breach. The definition of disclosure used in the HIPAA Privacy Rule is different from the definition in this report. For purposes of HIPAA, disclosure means the release, transfer, provision of access to, or divulging in any other manner of information outside the entity holding the information.\n\n【46】 #Disclosure (risk) assessment:\nA systematic review of a data file conducted to determine if any of the proposed contents present an unacceptable risk of individual disclosure. Disclosure risk assessment and control are usually conducted to prepare a public-use data set, and they can also be conducted when preparing a data set that is potentially linkable to another released data set.\nDisclosure (risk) control (also referred to as disclosure limitation or disclosure protection): The application of measures to reduce the possibility of identifying an individual through the characteristics available in a data file. Disclosure risk assessment and control are usually conducted in order to prepare a public-use data set, and they can also be conducted when preparing a data set that is potentially linkable to another released data set. Disclosure control includes steps taken to modify or suppress information that might identify an individual directly or indirectly before the data are made available to others for analysis\nIndividually identifiable data: Data or information which can be used to establish individual identity, either directly, using items such as name, address, or unique identifying number, or indirectly by linking data about a case-individual with other information that uniquely identifies them.\nMicrodata: A data file containing information in which each record provides information at the unit of data collection (e.g. individual persons, events, households, or establishments).\nPenalties: Penalties for a breach of confidentiality can range from imposing fines or a prison sentence to disciplinary action, barring an individual from receiving data in the future, or termination of employment or contract. Penalties can be established to differentiate willful from inadvertent disclosure and they can be tailored to the type of party responsible for the breach of confidentiality--an employee, contractor, or external data requestor.\nPopulation-based data: A complete count of cases occurring within a given population or a statistical sample of all cases occurring within a given population.\n\n【47】 #Predecisional exemption:\nThe Freedom of Information Act's \"predecisional\" exception is explained in 5 U.S.C.  552(b) as \"inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency.\" The term \"predecisional\" has been traditionally defined by the courts as meaning \"antecedent to the adoption of an agency policy.\" 27\n\n【48】 #Privacy:\nThe right of individuals to hold information about themselves in secret, free from the knowledge of others 28 .\nPrivacy Manager: A person who develops and implements a data system's confidentiality policy and is responsible for clearing responses to data requests for a surveillance system. A data steward may act as a privacy manager,\nProprietary: Produced or collected in such a way that exclusive rights may apply.\nProvisional or preliminary data: These data are thought to be close to final but subject to change as additional records are added to the dataset or updated information is obtained.

Public-use data are sometimes referred to as \"de-identified data\" and include public-use data sets (PUDS), tables, or other data formats, with all individually identifiable data or information removed, and with the remaining fields modified or suppressed so as to reduce disclosure risk as much as reasonably possible and such that it is not possible to create any tables that violate the numerator or denominator cell size rules for a given surveillance system.\nPublic-Use Data Set (PUDS):  public-use data.\nRe-release: For purposes of this report, CDC's re-release of data that the States initially provided to CDC through their data release procedures.

The Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a) prohibits agency disclosure of any record maintained in a Federal system of records when the primary method by which the data will be retrieved is by name, social security number, or other identifying particular, such as thumb print, except pursuant to a written request, or with the prior written consent of, the individual to whom the record pertains. The creation of a Federal system of records is announced in the Federal Register. While the Privacy Act is generally protective, it contains several exceptions to the Privacy Act which permit disclosure without a subject's consent, including disclosure of the record for a routine use. A routine use is a disclosure which is compatible with the purpose for which the record was collected, and which is included in the system notice. A complete list of exceptions is found within Title 5 U.S.C. 552(a) .\n\n【52】 #Appendices\nIn addition to the Privacy Act of 1974, which contains criminal penalties for the unauthorized disclosure of protected information, the Trade Secrets Act  makes it unlawful for any officer or employee of the United States or of any Federal department or agency to publish, divulge, disclose, or make known in any manner not authorized by law any information gained through the course of Federal employment that concerns or relates to \"trade secrets, processes, operations, style of work, or apparatus, or to the identity, confidential statistical data, amount or source of any income, profits, or losses, or expenditures of any person, firm, partnership, corporation, or association…\" Information acquired through the course of official duties, through an investigation or examination, or seen in a document, is covered by the Trade Secrets Act.

The Privacy Act applies only to records in \"systems of records*\" , from which information is retrieved by an individual's name or other identifier. Such records are subject to release to individuals asking for their own records, to other requestors with the signed consent of the named individual, or to other requestors without a subject's consent under limited conditions specified in the Privacy Act. *Definition -The term ''system of records'' means a group of any records under the control of any Federal agency from which information is retrieved by the name of the individual or by some identifying number, symbol, or other identifying particular assigned to the individual.\n\n【55】 #Freedom of Information Act (Title 5 USC 552)\nThe Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) provides that, upon receiving a written request from any person, a Federal agency must release any requested agency record unless that record falls within one of the nine FOIA exemptions. FOIA applies to only Federal agencies, and covers only records in the possession and control of those agencies except in certain narrow instances involving grantee-held data.\n- Exemptions from FOIA (Title 5 USC 552b) 1. protects from disclosure national security information concerning national defense or foreign policy, provided that it has been properly classified pursuant to Executive Order 12,958. 2. related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency;\n(a) internal matters of a relatively trivial nature; (b) more substantial internal matters, the disclosure of which would risk circumvention of a legal requirement. 3.\n(a) requires that the matter be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue; or (b) establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld; 4. trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person that is privileged or confidential; 5. inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than agency in litigation with the agency; 6. personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy; 7. records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that the production of such law enforcement records or information: (a) could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings; (b) would deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication;\n(c) could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of a person's privacy; (d) could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a confidential source, including a State, local or foreign agency or authority or any private institution which furnished information on a confidential basis, and, in the case of a record or information compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal investigation or by an agency conducting a lawful national security intelligence investigation, information furnished by a confidential source; (e) would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law; or (f) could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of any individual; 8. contained in or related to examination, operating, or condition reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of an agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of financial institutions; or 9. geological and geophysical information and data, including maps, concerning wells.\nAny reasonably segregable portion of a record shall be provided to any person requesting such record after deletion of the portions which are exempt under this subsection. The amount of information deleted shall be indicated on the released portion of the record, unless including that indication would harm an interest protected by the exemption in this subsection under which the deletion is made. If technically feasible, the amount of information deleted shall be indicated at the place in the record where such deletion is made.\n\n【56】 #Privacy Act (5 USC 552a)\nThe Privacy Act applies to records maintained by a Federal agency in a system of records in which the primary method for data to be retrieved is by full names, social security numbers, or other identifying particulars.\n\n【57】 #Disclosures Permitted by the Privacy Act\nThe Privacy Act permits disclosure without a subject's consent in certain circumstances:\n1. to those officers and employees of the agency which maintains the record who have a need for the record in the performance of their duties; 2 for a routine use (disclosure of identifiable data outside the Department for a purpose compatible with the purpose for which the data were collected); 4. to the Bureau of the Census for purposes of planning or carrying out a census or survey or related activity; 5. to a recipient who has provided the agency with advance adequate written assurance that the record will be used solely as a statistical research or reporting record, and the record is to be transferred in a form that is not individually identifiable; 6. to the National Archives and Records Administration as a record which has sufficient historical or other value to warrant its continued preservation by the United States Government; 7. to another agency or to an instrumentality of any jurisdiction within or under the control of the United States for a civil or criminal law enforcement activity if the activity is authorized by law, and if the head of the agency or instrumentality has made a written request to the agency which maintains the record specifying the particular portion desired and the law enforcement activity for which the record is sought; 8. to a person pursuant to a showing of compelling circumstances affecting the health or safety of an individual if upon such disclosure notification is transmitted to the last known address of such individual; 9.\n1 308(d) protects information collected for a project from being used for any purpose other than the purpose for which is was collected unless the person or establishment from which the data were obtained has consented to such use. Confidentiality assurances protect against disclosures under a court order and provide protections that the Privacy Act does not. For example, the Privacy Act only protects individual participants, but confidentiality assurances can also protect institutions.\nConfidentiality protection granted by the CDC promises participants and institutions that their data will be shared only with those individuals and organizations listed in the consent form and/or the Assurance of Confidentiality Statement for the project.\nProjects that involve the collection of sensitive information frequently need confidentiality protection. Sensitive information includes (but is not limited to) data collection on sexual behaviors, drug uses, mental health status, or other information that if released could reasonably be damaging to an individual's financial standing, employability, or reputation.\n\n【58】 \" \"The Secretary may authorize persons engaged in biomedical, behavioral, clinical, or other research (including research on mental health, including research on the use and effect of alcohol and other psychoactive drugs) to protect the privacy of individuals who are the subject of such research by withholding from all persons not connected with the conduct of such research the names or other identifying characteristics of such individuals. Persons so authorized to protect the privacy of such individuals may not be compelled in any Federal, State, or local civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, or other proceedings to identify such individuals.\"\nCertificates\n\n【59】 #Applying for Confidentiality Protections\nInvestigator(s) formally apply for confidentiality protections if they believe such protection is necessary to achieve the project objectives and to obtain valid information of a sensitive nature.\nData release: Dissemination of data either in a public-use file or as a result of an ad hoc request which results in the data steward no longer controlling the use of the data. Data may be released in a variety of formats including, but not limited to, tables, microdata (person records), or online query systems.\n\n【60】 #Data sharing agreement (DSA):\nA mechanism by which a data requestor and CDC program can define the terms of data access that can be granted to requestors.\n\n【61】 Federal Laws and Rules Governing Data Release\nCDC's practices and policies regarding data release are based on the framework of Federal Laws governing the maintenance and public disclosure of Federal records, the protection of key public priorities such as privacy, proprietary information, and national security, and obligations arising out of litigation or other compulsory processes The applicability and implications of these laws will vary depending on the nature of the data and other circumstances Questions by data stewards about the applicability of legal requirements should be directed to appropriate legal counsel.\nData collected by CDC, including data collected by States and provided to CDC, generally become a Federal record once received by CDC, and are subject to Federal laws and rules governing data release and Federal records retention laws. These include but are not limited to, the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), the Privacy Act of 1974, Confidentiality Assurances, and Certificates of Confidentiality", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

The term commonly refers to the veins on the leg, although varicose veins occur elsewhere. Veins have leaflet valves to prevent blood from flowing backwards (retrograde). Leg muscles pump the blood in veins to return it to the heart. When veins become enlarged, the leaflets of the valves no longer meet properly, and the valves don't work. A common cause of valve failure is Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT), which can cause permanent damage to the valves.  The blood collects in the veins and they enlarge even more. Varicose veins are common in the superficial veins of the legs, which are subject to high pressure when standing.\n\n【2】 #Causes\nVaricose veins are more common in women than in men, and are linked with heredity. Other related factors are pregnancy, obesity, menopause, aging, prolonged standing, leg injury and abdominal straining. Varicose veins are bulging veins that are larger than spider veins, typically 3 mm or more in diameter. Varicose veins are distinguished from reticular veins (blue veins) and telangiectasias (spider veins) which also involve valvular insufficiency, by the size and location of the veins.\n\n【3】 #Natural History, Complications and Prognosis\nThese often occur in people who are involved in work requiring prolonged periods of standing. The high pressure that builds up during those periods cause the veins to become tortuous and their valves to fail. With time, these varicosities can enlarge and cause swelling as well as pain of legs at the end of the day. Eventually, these can become associated with superficial ulcers which  can bleed and/or get infected. Stagnation of the venous blood in these veins can also lead to formation of blood clots.\nSerious complications are rare but severe varicosities can lead to major complications such as thrombophlebitis, venous ulcers & clotting of blood, due to the poor circulation through the affected limb.\n\n【4】 ## Symptoms\nBesides cosmetic problems, varicose veins are often tortuous and  painful, especially when standing or walking. They often itch, and scratching them can cause ulcers.\n\n【5】 ## Medical Therapy\nNon-surgical treatments include sclerotherapy, elastic stockings, elevating the legs, and exercise. The traditional surgical treatment has been vein stripping to remove the affected veins. Newer surgical treatments are less invasive  and are slowly replacing traditional surgical treatments. Since most of the blood in the legs is returned by the deep veins, and the superficial veins only return about 10%, they can be removed or ablated without serious harm.\n\n【6】 ## Surgery\nSeveral techniques have been performed for over a century, from the more invasive named \"saphenous stripping\" up to mini invasives like superficial phlectomies and CHIVA cure.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Twice-weekly dosing is not recommended in HIV-patients with CD4 lymphocyte counts less than 100 cells/mm.\n\n【4】 ### HIV infection - Inactive tuberculosis - Dosing Information\n- The recommended dose of isoniazid for the prevention of active tuberculosis (TB) (ie, treatment of latent tuberculosis) in adults and adolescents with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is 300 mg orally daily. Alternatively, 900 mg orally may be given twice weekly.\n- Pyridoxine 50 mg orally daily should always be administered concomitantly with isoniazid to minimize the risk of peripheral neuropathy. The recommended duration of prophylaxis with isoniazid is 9 months. Directly observed therapy is recommended with intermittent dosing regimens to maximize compliance rates.\n- As an equal alternative to a 9-month isoniazid course for HIV-infected, nonpregnant adults who are otherwise healthy and are not receiving antiretroviral therapy, the CDC recommends a combination regimen of isoniazid plus rifapentine orally once weekly (given as directly observed therapy) for 12 weeks. The isoniazid dose is 15 mg/kg (rounded up to the nearest 50 or 100 mg; maximum, 900 mg) and the rifapentine dose is as follows: 300 mg (10 to 14 kg), 450 mg (14.1 to 25 kg), 600 mg (25.1 to 32 kg), 750 mg (32.1 to 49.9 kg), or 900 mg (50 kg or greater). Due to lack of drug interaction data, this regimen is not recommended in HIV-infected patients receiving antiretroviral therapy.\n\n【5】 ### Inactive tuberculosis - Dosing Information\n- 5 mg/kg (MAX, 300 mg) ORALLY once daily for 9 months  15 mg/kg (MAX, 900 mg) ORALLY twice weekly as directly observed therapy for 9 months (guideline recommendation).\n- Alternative: 15 mg/kg (rounded up to the nearest 50 or 100 mg; MAX, 900 mg) ORALLY once weekly in combination with rifapentine ORALLY once weekly for 12 weeks (rifapentine dose: 300 mg (10 to 14 kg), 450 mg (14.1 to 25 kg), 600 mg (25.1 to 32 kg), 750 mg (32.1 to 49.9 kg), or 900 mg (50 kg or greater)); give only as directly observed therapy (guideline recommendation).\n\n【6】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\n- Dosing Information\n- The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in association with the American Thoracic Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America, recommends a 6-month treatment regimen for tuberculosis in HIV-infected patients on antiretroviral therapy. The treatment regimen consists of a 2-month initial phase of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol, followed by a continuation phase of 4 to 7 months. For patients on directly observed therapy (DOT), 5 day-a-week dosing may be used to replace 7 day-a-week dosing (AIII). Rifabutin, which has fewer problematic drug interactions, may be used interchangeably with rifampin; dose adjustments to rifabutin and antiretroviral agents may be necessary. Ethambutol may be excluded if drug susceptibility results indicate that the organisms are fully susceptible to isoniazid and rifampin. If pyrazinamide cannot be included in the initial phase due to conditions such as severe liver disease, gout, or pregnancy, the initial phase should consist of isoniazid, rifampin, and ethambutol given once daily for 2 months. If isoniazid cannot be used, a 6-month regimen of rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol may be substituted (BI). If rifampin cannot be used, treatment with isoniazid and ethambutol for 12 to 18 months, with pyrazinamide during at least the initial phase is recommended. Completion of treatment should be determined by the total number of doses taken, and not solely on duration of therapy. The following is a list of 4 different regimens of initial and continuation phases that may be used for the treatment of tuberculosis in HIV-infected patients. Strength of recommendation and quality of evidence ratings are included at the end of this protocol.\n- Regimen 1\n- Initial Phase:\n- Isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol administered once daily for 56 doses/8 weeks (AII),\n- Isoniazid and rifampin administered twice weekly for 36 doses/18 weeks (AII) (not recommended in HIV-infected patients with CD4+ counts less than 100 cells/milliliter)\n- Regimen 2 (not recommended in HIV-infected patients with CD4+ counts less than 100 cells/milliliter)\n\n【7】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n- There is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Isoniazid (oral) in adult patients.\n\n【8】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Pediatric)\n- Dosing Information\n- The following is recommended dosing based on daily or twice weekly administration.\n- Extrapulmonary tuberculosis should be managed with the dosing regimens outlined for pulmonary tuberculosis.\n- Intensive 8-week Phase:\n- The recommended dose of oral isoniazid for the treatment of drug susceptible HIV-related TB in infants and children is 10 to 15 mg/kg daily (maximum dose 300 mg/day) in combination with rifampin (10 to 20 mg/kg ORALLY once daily, up to 600 mg/day), pyrazinamide (20 to 40 mg/kg ORALLY once daily, up to 2000 mg/day), and ethambutol (15 to 25 mg/kg ORALLY once daily, up to 2500 mg/day) for 8 weeks.\n- Continuation 9 to 12 week Phase:\n- After the 8 week initial intensive phase, once daily dosing of isoniazid and rifampin may be continued if susceptible. Alternatively, an intermittent regimen of isoniazid 20 to 30 mg/kg once daily (max 900 mg/day) 3 times per week in combination with rifampin 10 to 20 mg/kg once daily (max 600 mg/day) 3 times per week may be used. For patients older than 6 years who are not immunosuppressed (CD4 count greater than 25% or greater than 500 cells/microL), isoniazid and rifampin may be administered twice weekly; however, severely immunosuppressed patients should receive only a daily or 3 times weekly regimen due to increased rifampin resistance with a twice weekly regimen. Total treatment duration should be no less than 9 to 12 months.\n\n【9】 ### Inactive tuberculosis - Dosing Information\n- The preferred regimen for the treatment of latent tuberculosis in children is isoniazid 10 to 20 mg/kg (maximum, 300 mg) orally once daily for 9 months  20 to 40 mg/kg (maximum, 900 mg) orally twice weekly as directly observed therapy for 9 months.\n- As an equal alternative to isoniazid for children 12 years or older, the CDC recommends a combination regimen of isoniazid plus rifapentine orally once weekly (given as directly observed therapy) for 12 weeks. The isoniazid dose is 15 mg/kg (rounded up to the nearest 50 or 100 mg; maximum, 900 mg) and the rifapentine dose is as follows: 300 mg (10 to 14 kg), 450 mg (14.1 to 25 kg), 600 mg (25.1 to 32 kg), 750 mg (32.1 to 49.9 kg), or 900 mg (50 kg or greater).\n\n【10】 ### HIV infection - Inactive tuberculosis - Dosing Information\n- The recommended dose of isoniazid for the prevention of active tuberculosis (TB) (ie, treatment of latent tuberculosis) in children with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is 10 to 15 mg/kg (maximum, 300 mg) orally daily for 9 months. Alternatively, 20 to 30 mg/kg (maximum, 900 mg) orally may be given twice weekly for 9 months. Pyridoxine should always be administered concomitantly with isoniazid in children with symptomatic HIV infection.\n- As an equal alternative to a 9-month isoniazid course for HIV-infected, nonpregnant adolescents (12 years or older) who are otherwise healthy and are not receiving antiretroviral therapy, the CDC recommends a combination regimen of isoniazid plus rifapentine orally once weekly (given as directly observed therapy) for 12 weeks. The isoniazid dose is 15 mg/kg (rounded up to the nearest 50 or 100 mg; maximum, 900 mg) and the rifapentine dose is as follows: 300 mg (10 to 14 kg), 450 mg (14.1 to 25 kg), 600 mg (25.1 to 32 kg), 750 mg (32.1 to 49.9 kg), or 900 mg (50 kg or greater). Due to lack of drug interaction data, this regimen is not recommended in HIV-infected patients receiving antiretroviral therapy.\n\n【11】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\n- There is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Isoniazid (oral) in pediatric patients.\n\n【12】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n- There is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Isoniazid (oral) in pediatric patients.\n\n【13】 #Contraindications\n- Isoniazid is contraindicated in patients who develop severe hypersensitivity reactions, including drug-induced hepatitis; previous isoniazid-associated hepatic injury; severe adverse reactions to isoniazid such as drug fever, chills, arthritis; and acute liver disease of any etiology.\n\n【14】 -  the boxed WARNING.\n\n【15】 ### Precautions\nGeneral:\n- All drugs should be stopped and an evaluation made at the first sign of a hypersensitivity reaction. If isoniazid therapy must be reinstituted, the drug should be given only after symptoms have cleared. The drug should be restarted in very small and gradually increasing doses and should be withdrawn immediately if there is any indication of recurrent hypersensitivity reaction.\n- Use of isoniazid should be carefully monitored in the following:\n- Daily users of alcohol. Daily ingestion of alcohol may be associated with a higher incidence of + isoniazid hepatitis.\n- Patients with active chronic liver disease or severe renal dysfunction.\n- Age > 35.\n- Concurrent use of any chronically administered medication.\n- History of previous discontinuation of isoniazid.\n- Existence of peripheral neuropathy or conditions predisposing to neuropathy.\n- Pregnancy.\n- Injection drug use.\n- Women belonging to minority groups, particularly in the postpartum period.\n- HIV seropositive patients.\n- Laboratory Tests:\n- Because there is a higher frequency of isoniazid associated hepatitis among certain patient groups, including Age > 35, daily users of alcohol, chronic liver disease, injection drug use and women belonging to minority groups, particularly in the post-partum period, transaminase measurements should be obtained prior to starting and monthly during preventative therapy or more frequently as needed. If any of the values exceed three to five times the upper limit of normal, isoniazid should be temporarily discontinued and consideration given to restarting therapy.\n\n【16】 ## Clinical Trials Experience\n- The most frequent reactions are those affecting the nervous system and the liver.\n- Nervous System Reactions: Peripheral neuropathy is the most common toxic effect. It is dose-related, occurs most often in the malnourished and in those predisposed to neuritis (e.g. alcoholics and diabetics), and is usually preceded by paresthesias of the feet and hands. The incidence is higher in \"slow inactivators\".\n- Other neurotoxic effects, which are uncommon with conventional doses, are convulsions, toxic encephalopathy, optic neuritis and atrophy, memory impairment, and toxic psychosis.\n- Hepatic Reactions:  boxed WARNING. Elevated serum transaminase (SGOT; SGPT), bilirubinemia, bilirubinuria, jaundice, and occasionally severe and sometimes fatal hepatitis. The common prodromal symptoms of hepatitis are anorexia, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, malaise, and weakness. Mild hepatic dysfunction, evidenced by mild and transient elevation of serum transaminase levels occurs in 10% to 20% of patients taking isoniazid. This abnormality usually appears in the first 1 to 3 months of treatment but can occur at any time during therapy. In most instances, enzyme levels return to normal and generally, there is no necessity to discontinue medication during the period of mild serum transaminase elevation. In occasional instances, progressive liver damage occurs, with accompanying symptoms. If the SGOT value exceeds three to five times the upper limit of normal, discontinuation of the isoniazid should be strongly considered. The frequency of progressive liver damage increases with age. It is rare in persons under 20, but occurs in up to 2.3 percent of those over 50 years of age.\n- Gastrointestinal Reactions: Nausea, vomiting and epigastric distress.\n- Hematologic Reactions: Agranulocytosis; hemolytic, sideroblastic or aplastic anemia, thrombocytopenia; and eosinophilia.\n- Metabolic and Endocrine Reactions: Pyridoxine deficiency, pellagra, hyperglycemia, metabolic acidosis and gynecomastia.\n- Miscellaneous Reactions: Rheumatic syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus-like syndrome.\n- To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact West-Ward Pharmaceutical Corp.\n\n【17】 ## Postmarketing Experience\n- There is limited information regarding Postmarketing Experience of Isoniazid (oral) in the drug label.\n\n【18】 #Drug Interactions\n- Food: Isoniazid should not be administered with food. Studies have shown that the bioavailability of isoniazid is reduced significantly when administered with food. Tyramine- and histamine-containing foods should be avoided in patients receiving isoniazid. Because isoniazid has some monoamine oxidase inhibiting activity, an interaction with tyramine-containing foods (cheese, red wine) may occur. Diamine oxidase may also be inhibited, causing exaggerated response (e.g. headache, sweating, palpitations, flushing, hypotension) to foods containing histamine (e.g. skipjack, tuna, other tropical fish).\nAcetaminophen:\n- A report of severe acetaminophen toxicity was reported in a patient receiving isoniazid. It is believed that the toxicity may have resulted from a previously unrecognized interaction between isoniazid and acetaminophen and a molecular basis for this interaction has been proposed. However, current evidence suggests that isoniazid does induce P-450IIE1, a mixed-function oxidase enzyme that appears to generate the toxic metabolites, in the liver. Furthermore it has been proposed that isoniazid resulted in induction of P-450IIE1 in the patient's liver which, in turn, resulted in a greater proportion of the ingested acetaminophen being converted to the toxic metabolites. Studies have demonstrated that pretreatment with isoniazid potentiates acetaminophen hepatotoxicity in rats1,2.\nCarbamazepine:\n- Isoniazid is known to slow the metabolism of carbamazepine and increase its serum levels. Carbamazepine levels should be determined prior to concurrent administration with isoniazid, signs and symptoms of carbamazepine toxicity should be monitored closely, and appropriate dosage adjustment of the anticonvulsant should be made3.\nKetoconazole:\n- Potential interaction of ketoconazole and isoniazid may exist. When ketoconazole is given in combination with isoniazid and rifampin the AUC of ketoconazole is decreased by as much as 88% after 5 months of concurrent isoniazid and rifampin therapy4.\nPhenytoin:\n- Isoniazid may increase serum levels of phenytoin. To avoid phenytoin intoxication, appropriate adjustment of the anticonvulsant should be made5,6.\nTheophylline:\nValproate:\n\n【19】 ### Pregnancy\nPregnancy Category (FDA): C\nTeratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category C:\n- Isoniazid has been shown to have an embryocidal effect in rats and rabbits when given orally during pregnancy. Isoniazid was not teratogenic in reproduction studies in mice, rats and rabbits. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Isoniazid should be used as a treatment for active tuberculosis during pregnancy because the benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. The benefit of preventive therapy also should be weighed against a possible risk to the fetus. Preventive therapy generally should be started after delivery to prevent putting the fetus at risk of exposure; the low levels of isoniazid in breast milk do not threaten the neonate. Since isoniazid is known to cross the placental barrier, neonates of isoniazid treated mothers should be carefully observed for any evidence of adverse affects.\nNonteratogenic effects:\n- Since isoniazid is known to cross the placental barrier, neonates of isoniazid-treated mothers should be carefully observed for any evidence of adverse effects.\n- Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) Pregnancy Category\n- There is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Isoniazid (oral) in women who are pregnant.\n\n【20】 ### Labor and Delivery\n- There is no FDA guidance on use of Isoniazid (oral) during labor and delivery.\n\n【21】 ### Nursing Mothers\n- The small concentrations of isoniazid in breast milk do not produce toxicity in the nursing newborn; therefore, breast feeding should not be discouraged. However, because levels of isoniazid are so low in breast milk, they can not be relied upon for prophylaxis or therapy of nursing infants.\n\n【22】 ### Pediatric Use\n- There is no FDA guidance on the use of Isoniazid (oral) with respect to pediatric patients.\n\n【23】 ### Geriatic Use\n- There is no FDA guidance on the use of Isoniazid (oral) with respect to geriatric patients.\n\n【24】 ### Gender\n- There is no FDA guidance on the use of Isoniazid (oral) with respect to specific gender populations.\n\n【25】 ### Race\n- There is no FDA guidance on the use of Isoniazid (oral) with respect to specific racial populations.\n\n【26】 ### Renal Impairment\n- There is no FDA guidance on the use of Isoniazid (oral) in patients with renal impairment.\n\n【27】 ### Hepatic Impairment\n- There is no FDA guidance on the use of Isoniazid (oral) in patients with hepatic impairment.\n\n【28】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\n- There is no FDA guidance on the use of Isoniazid (oral) in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n\n【29】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\n- There is no FDA guidance one the use of Isoniazid (oral) in patients who are immunocompromised.\n\n【30】 ### Administration\n- : NOTE: For preventive therapy of tuberculous infection and treatment of tuberculosis, it is recommended that physicians be familiar with the following publications:  the recommendations of the Advisory Council for the Elimination of Tuberculosis, published in the MMWR: vol 42; RR-4, 1993 and  Treatment of Tuberculosis and Tuberculosis Infection in Adults and Children, American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine: vol 149; 1359-1374, 1994.\n- For Treatment of Tuberculosis:\n- Isoniazid is used in conjunction with other effective anti-tuberculosis agents. Drug susceptibility testing should be performed on the organisms initially isolated from all patients with newly diagnosed tuberculosis. If the bacilli becomes resistant, therapy must be changed to agents to which the bacilli are susceptible.\nUsual Oral Dosage (depending on the regimen used):\nAdults:\n- 5 mg/kg up to 300 mg daily in a single dose; or - 15 mg/kg up to 900 mg/day, two or three times/week\nChidren:\nPatients with Pulmonary Tuberculosis Without HIV Infection:\n- There are 3 regimen options for the initial treatment of tuberculosis in children and adults:\n- Option 1: Daily isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide for 8 weeks followed by 16 weeks of isoniazid and rifampin daily or 2 to 3 times weekly. Ethambutol or streptomycin should be added to the initial regimen until sensitivity to isoniazid and rifampin is demonstrated. The addition of a fourth drug is optional if the relative prevalence of isoniazid-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates in the community is less than or equal to four percent.\n- Option 2: Daily isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and streptomycin or ethambutol for 2 weeks followed by twice weekly administration of the same drugs for 6 weeks, subsequently twice weekly isoniazid and rifampin for 16 weeks.\n- Option 3: Three times weekly with isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol or streptomycin for 6 months.\n- All regimens given twice weekly or 3 times weekly should be administered by directly observed therapy .\n- The above treatment guidelines apply only when the disease is caused by organisms that are susceptible to the standard antituberculous agents. Because of the impact of resistance to isoniazid and rifampin on the response to therapy, it is essential that physicians initiating therapy for tuberculosis be familiar with the prevalence of drug resistance in their communities. It is suggested that ethambutol not be used in children whose visual acuity cannot be monitored.\n- Bacteriologic evaluation of Extra pulmonary tuberculosis may be limited by the relative inaccessibility of the sites of disease. Thus, response to treatment often must be judged on the basis of clinical and radiographic findings.\nPregnant Women with Tuberculosis:\nTreatment of Patients with Multi-Drug Resistant Tuberculosis (MDRTB):\nDirectly Observed Therapy (DOT):\nFor Preventative Therapy of Tuberculosis:\n- Adults over 30 Kg: 300 mg per day in a single dose.\n- Continuous administration of isoniazid for a sufficient period is an essential part of the regimen because relapse rates are higher if chemotherapy is stopped prematurely. In the treatment of tuberculosis, resistant organisms may multiply and the emergence of resistant organisms during the treatment may necessitate a change in the regimen.\n- Concomitant administration of pyridoxine (B6) is recommended in the malnourished and in those predisposed to neuropathy (e.g. alcoholics and diabetics).\n\n【31】 ### Monitoring\n- Patients given isoniazid should be carefully monitored and interviewed at monthly intervals. For persons 35 and older, in addition to monthly symptom reviews, hepatic enzymes ,specifically, AST and ALT (formerly SGOT and SGPT, respectively) should be measured prior to starting isoniazid therapy and periodically throughout treatment. Isoniazid-associated hepatitis usually occurs during the first three months of treatment. Usually, enzyme levels return to normal despite continuance of drug, but in some cases progressive liver dysfunction occurs. Other factors associated with an increased risk of hepatitis include daily use of alcohol, chronic liver disease and injection drug use. A recent report suggests an increased risk of fatal hepatitis associated with isoniazid among women, particularly Black and Hispanic women. The risk may also be increased during the post partum period. More careful monitoring should be considered in these groups, possibly including more frequent laboratory monitoring. If abnormalities of liver function exceed three to five times the upper limit of normal, discontinuation of isoniazid should be strongly considered.\n- Use of isoniazid should be carefully monitored in the following:\n- Daily users of alcohol. Daily ingestion of alcohol may be associated with a higher incidence of + isoniazid hepatitis.\n- Patients with active chronic liver disease or severe renal dysfunction.\n- Age > 35.\n- Concurrent use of any chronically administered medication.\n- History of previous discontinuation of isoniazid.\n- Existence of peripheral neuropathy or conditions predisposing to neuropathy.\n- Pregnancy.\n- Injection drug use.\n- Women belonging to minority groups, particularly in the postpartum period.\n- HIV seropositive patients.\n- Carbamazepine levels should be determined prior to concurrent administration with isoniazid, signs and symptoms of carbamazepine toxicity should be monitored closely, and appropriate dosage adjustment of the anticonvulsant should be made.\n- Theophylline serum levels should be monitored closely and appropriate dosage adjustments of theophylline should be made as the therapeutic range of theophylline is narrow.\n- Plasma valproate concentration should be monitored when isoniazid and valproate are co-administered, and appropriate dosage adjustments of valproate should be made.\n- Patients with this degree of INH intoxication are likely to have hypoventilation. The administration of sodium bicarbonate under these circumstances can cause exacerbation of hypercarbia. Ventilation must be monitored carefully, by measuring blood carbon dioxide levels and supported mechanically, if there is respiratory insufficiency.\n\n【32】 #IV Compatibility\n- There is limited information regarding IV Compatibility of Isoniazid (oral) in the drug label.\n\n【33】 #Overdosage\nSigns and Symptoms:\n- Isoniazid overdosage produces signs and symptoms within 30 minutes to 3 hours after ingestion. Nausea, vomiting, dizziness, slurring of speech, blurring of vision and visual hallucinations (including bright colors and strange designs) are among the early manifestations. With marked overdosage, respiratory distress and CNS depression, progressing rapidly from stupor to profound coma, are to be expected, along with severe, intractable seizures. Severe metabolic acidosis, acetonuria and hyperglycemia are typical laboratory findings.\nTreatment:\n- Untreated or inadequately treated cases of gross isoniazid overdosage, 80 mg/kg to 150 mg/kg, can cause neurotoxicity6 and terminate fatally, but good response has been reported in most patients brought under adequate treatment within the first few hours after drug ingestion.\nFor the Asymptomatic Patient:\n- Ensure adequate ventilation, support cardiac output, and protect the airway while treating seizures and attempting to limit absorption. If the dose of isoniazid is known, the patient should be treated initially with a slow intravenous bolus of pyridoxine, over 3 to 5 minutes, on a gram per gram basis, equal to the isoniazid dose. If the quantity of isoniazid ingestion is unknown, then consider an initial intravenous bolus of pyridoxine of 5 grams in the adult or 80 mg/kg in the child. If seizures continue, the dosage of pyridoxine may be repeated. It would be rare that more than 10 grams of pyridoxine would need to be given. The maximum safe dose for pyridoxine in isoniazid intoxication is not known. If the patient does not respond to pyridoxine, diazepam may be administered. Phenytoin should be used cautiously, because isoniazid interferes with the metabolism of phenytoin.\nGeneral:\n- Obtain blood samples for immediate determination of gases, electrolytes, BUN, glucose, etc.; type and cross-match blood in preparation for possible hemodialysis.\nRapid control of metabolic acidosis:\n- Patients with this degree of INH intoxication are likely to have hypoventilation. The administration of sodium bicarbonate under these circumstances can cause exacerbation of hypercarbia. Ventilation must be monitored carefully, by measuring blood carbon dioxide levels and supported mechanically, if there is respiratory insufficiency.\nDialysis:\n- Both peritoneal and hemodialysis have been used in the management of isoniazid overdosage. These procedures are probably not required if control of seizures and acidosis is achieved with pyridoxine, diazepam and bicarbonate.\n\n【34】 ## Mechanism of Action\n- Isoniazid inhibits the synthesis of mycoloic acids, an essential component of the bacterial cell wall. At therapeutic levels isoniazid is bacteriocidal against actively growing intracellular and extracellular Mycobacterium tuberculosis organisms.\n\n【35】 ## Structure\n- Isoniazid is an antibacterial available as 100 mg and 300 mg tablets for oral administration. Each tablet also contains as inactive ingredients: anhydrous lactose, calcium stearate, colloidal silicon dioxide, microcrystalline cellulose, and stearic acid.\n- Isoniazid is chemically known as isonicotinyl hydrazine or isonicotinic acid hydrazide. It has an empirical formula of C6H7N3O and a molecular weight of 137.14. It has the following structure:\n\n【36】 ## Pharmacodynamics\n- There is limited information regarding Pharmacodynamics of Isoniazid (oral) in the drug label.\n\n【37】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n- Within 1 to 2 hours after oral administration, isoniazid produces peak blood levels which decline to 50 percent or less within 6 hours. It diffuses readily into all body fluids (cerebrospinal, pleural, and ascitic fluids), tissues, organs, and excreta (saliva, sputum, and feces). The drug also passes through the placental barrier and into milk in concentrations comparable to those in the plasma. From 50 to 70 percent of a dose of isoniazid is excreted in the urine in 24 hours.\n- Isoniazid is metabolized primarily by acetylation and dehydrazination. The rate of acetylation is genetically determined. Approximately 50 percent of Blacks and Caucasians are \"slow inactivators\" and the rest are \"rapid inactivators\"; the majority of Eskimos and Orientals are “rapid inactivators”.\n- The rate of acetylation does not significantly alter the effectiveness of isoniazid. However, slow acetylation may lead to higher blood levels of the drug and, thus, to an increase in toxic reactions.\n- Pyridoxine (vitamin B6), deficiency is sometimes observed in adults with high doses of isoniazid and is considered probably due to its competition with pyridoxal phosphate for the enzyme apotryptophanase.\n- Isoniazid resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli develop rapidly when isoniazid monotherapy is administered.\n- Microbiology:\n- Two standardized in vitro susceptibility methods are available for testing isoniazid against Mycobacterium tuberculosis organisms. The agar proportion method (CDC or NCCLS M24-P) utilizes middlebrook 7H10 medium impregnated with isoniazid at two final concentrations, 0.2 and 1.0 mcg/mL. MIC99 values are calculated by comparing the quantity of organisms growing in the medium containing drug to the control cultures. Mycobacterial growth in the presence of drug ≥ 1% of the control indicates resistance.\n- The radiometric broth method employs the BACTEC 460 machine to compare the growth index from untreated control cultures to cultures grown in the presence of 0.2 and 1.0 mcg/mL of isoniazid. Strict adherence to the manufacturer's instructions for sample processing and data interpretation is required for this assay.\n- Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates with an MIC99 ≤ 0.2 mcg/mL are considered to be susceptible to isoniazid. Susceptibility test results obtained by the two different methods discussed above cannot be compared unless equivalent drug concentrations are evaluated.\n\n【38】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\nCarcinogenesis and Mutagenesis:\n- Isoniazid has been shown to induce pulmonary tumors in a number of strains of mice. Isoniazid has not been shown to be carcinogenic in humans. (Note: a diagnosis of mesothelioma in a child with prenatal exposure to isoniazid and no other apparent risk factors has been reported). Isoniazid has been found to be weakly mutagenic in strains TA 100 and TA 1535 of Salmonella typhimurium (Ames assay) without metabolic activation.\n\n【39】 #Clinical Studies\n- There is limited information regarding Clinical Studies of Isoniazid (oral) in the drug label.\n\n【40】 #How Supplied\n- Isoniazid Tablets, USP 300 mg: White, Round Tablets; Debossed \"West-ward 261\" on one side and Scored on the other side.\n\n【41】 ## Storage\n- Store at 20 to 25°C (68 to 77°F) . Protect from light and moisture.\n- Dispense in a tight, light-resistant container as defined in the USP using a child-resistant closure.\n\n【42】 #Patient Counseling Information\n- There is limited information regarding Patient Counseling Information of Isoniazid (oral) in the drug label.\n\n【43】 #Precautions with Alcohol\n- Alcohol-Isoniazid (oral) interaction has not been established.

{"seq_id": "a71a754e-66db-4b2b-b2f9-626974c568c7", "title": null, "text": "【0】 Early repolarization\nSynonyms and keywords: early repolarization pattern; early repol; early repol variant\n\n【1】 #Overview\nEarly repolarization is defined as either a notch described as a positive deflection after a positive QRS segment or a J point elevation of more than 0.1 mV in at least two consecutive leads. While early repolarization has been long considered a normal benign ECG variant, some studies suggest an association between early repolarization and increased risk of arrhythmia, particularly ventricular fibrillation. Moreover, early repolarization pattern must be differentiated from early repolarization syndrome as the former is strictly an EKG finding whereas the latter represents a symptomatic situation of cardiac arrest or syncope following the occurrence of an early repolarization pattern. Early repolarization can be confused with STEMI and pericarditis.\n\n【2】 #Natural History, Complications and Prognosis - Early repolarization pattern has been considered benign for a long time until some studies suggested an association between early repolarization and increased risk of arrhythmia, particularly ventricular fibrillation. A possible explanation of the increased vulnerability to ventricular fibrillation associated with early repolarization is that early repolarization might be an indicator of transmural repolarization heterogeneity.\n- This association has shed light on the importance of evaluating early repolarization patterns and their prognostic implications. Whereas early repolarization is a common finding, idiopathic ventricular fibrillation is a rare entity which incidence ranges from 3:100000 to 10:100000.\nThe majority of early repolarization patterns, especially if incidentally found in otherwise asymptomatic people with a negative family history, have no or minimal increased risk of arrhythmia.\nEarly repolarization carries a higher risk of arrhythmia in patients with underlying cardiac pathology.\nEarly repolarization is rarely associated with a primary arrythmogenic disorder that manifests as idiopathic ventricular fibrillation. Genetic predisposition seems to play a role in this group of people. In addition, early repolarization seems to cause arrhythmia during sleep or at rest in the absence of any physical activity.\n- In addition, early repolarization seems to have different patterns which have different clinical significance. Hence, a standardized evaluation of early repolarization is needed. Early repolarization patterns that demonstrate a rapidly ascending ST segment after the J point are almost always benign.\n- A case control study of 120 post MI patients with implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) demonstrated that early repolarization was more frequently observed among patients with documented episodes of ventricular fibrillation (32% vs. 8%, p=0.005). The leads demonstrating early repolarization were more often the inferior leads (23% vs. 8%, p=0.03). A trend was observed for the lateral leads (V4-V6) as well (12% vs. 3%, p=0.11). In contrast, leads I and aVL were not commonly involved (3% vs. 0%).  The morphology of the ST segment was critical and a notch in the ST segment was observed more frequently among patients with ventricular fibrillation (28% vs. 7%, p=0.008).  In contrast, J-point elevation and slurring of the ST segment surprisingly were not associated with ventricular arrhythmias.\n\n【3】 ## Early Repolarization Syndrome\n- The terms early repolarization and early repolarization syndrome must be differentiated. Early repolarization is a term used to describe changes noted on ECG regardless of the presence or absence of any symptoms. Early repolarization syndrome is the presence of cardiac arrest, and less frequently syncope, in the absence of any other cause that can explain the early repolarization changes on ECG. The diagnosis of early repolarization syndrome requires ruling out other etiologies that might be responsible for the ECG changes.\n- In addition, the symptoms associated with early repolarization syndrome immediately follow the ECG changes.\n\n【4】 ## Other Causes of ST Elevation\nEarly repolarization must be differentiated from other causes of ST elevation including STEMI and pericarditis.\n- The ST segment elevation of early repolarization is exacerbated by bradycardia, carotid sinus massage and vagal maneuvers. This is not true in STEMI or pericarditis.\n- Early repolarization is characterized by a notch at the J point which is not a characteristic finding in STEMI or pericarditis. Shown below is an image demonstrating a characteristic notch which is present at the J point in early repolarization.\n- The height of the J point can be used to differentiate early repolarization from other conditions. Only lead V6 is used to distinguish between early repolarization and pericarditis. As shown in the image below, if A/B > 25%, pericarditis should be suspected. If A/B < 25%, early repolarization is more probable.\n\n【5】 #EKG Examples\nShown below is an EKG demonstrating J point elevation, concave shaped up-sloping ST segment, and prominent T waves in the inferior and lateral leads depicting benign early repolarization.\nShown below are examples of EKG depicting early repolarization and other normal variants of ST elevation.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "418dfa0c-1444-49e8-ab05-a605162d05f6", "title": null, "text": "【0】 DRESS syndrome overview\n\n【1】 #Overview\nDrug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) syndrome is a severe adverse drug reaction. The exact pathogenesis of DRESS syndrome is poorly understood, but it is thought that genetic deficiency of detoxifying enzymes, such as epoxide hydrolase deficiency, results in accumulation of toxic metabolites following drug administration and subsequent activation of immunologic reactions. The incidence of DRESS syndrome is approximately 10 to 100 per 100,000 drug exposures with a case-fatality rate of approximately 10%. DRESS syndrome has been reported among patients of all age groups with neither gender nor racial predilection.\nCommon symptoms of DRESS syndrome include rash and fever. DRESS syndrome is characterized by a prolonged latency period (2-8 weeks following the administration of triggering drug). If left untreated, DRESS syndrome self-resolves following the discontinuation of the triggering drug in the majority of cases, but clinical manifestations may persist up to 3 months. Complications of DRESS syndrome include visceral organ involvement and development of chronic autoimmune diseases. Common physical examination findings of patients with DRESS syndrome include high-grade fever, diffuse exanthematous eruption (commonly exfoliative dermatitis), lymphadenopathy, facial edema, abdominal tenderness, and hepatomegaly. Laboratory findings of patients with DRESS syndrome usually differ depending on the organ involvement. Common Lab findings include anemia, eosinophilia, atypical lymphocytosis, monocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and elevated anti-HHV6 antibodies (viral reactivation). Drug withdrawal is the first step in the management of DRESS syndrome. Supportive care is considered the mainstay of therapy, and hospitalization and administration of pharmacologic agents is usually necessary. Medical therapy for the management of DRESS syndrome usually include topical and/or systemic corticosteroids, antipyretic agents, and symptomatic management of exfoliative dermatitis (fluids, nutritional support, management of electrolyte imbalances, and sepsis prevention).\n\n【2】 #Historical Perspective\nThe early descriptions of DRESS syndrome were made in the 1940s and 1950s. The term DRESS syndrome was first coined by Helene Bocquet, a French dermatologist, in 1996.\n\n【3】 #Classification\nThere is no classification system established for DRESS syndrome.\n\n【4】 #Pathophysiology\nThe exact pathogenesis of DRESS syndrome is poorly understood. It is thought that an interaction between genetic and environmental factors is responsible for the development of DRESS syndrome. Genetic deficiency of detoxifying enzymes, such as epoxide hydrolase deficiency, results in accumulation of toxic metabolites and subsequent activation of immunologic reactions. A post-viral reaction (T-cell cross-reacion) has also been postulated due to the high incidence of viral reactivation following DRESS syndrome. On histopathological analysis of skin biopsy, DRESS syndrome is not characterized by a specific finding. Common histopathological findings include non-specific lymphocytic and eosinophilic infiltration with involvement of the papillary dermis and evidence of epidermotropism.\n\n【5】 #Causes\nDRESS syndrome is an adverse drug reaction. Common causes of DRESS syndrome include anticonvulsants, allopurinol, antiviral agents, and antibiotics, but virtually all drugs may cause DRESS syndrome.\n\n【6】 #Differentiating DRESS syndrome from Other Diseases\nDRESS syndrome must be differentiated from other diseases that cause fever, rash, and visceral involvement, such as exanthematous pustulosis, psoriasis, Still's disease, toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, lymphoma, serum sickness, drug-induced liver injury, and Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome.\n\n【7】 #Epidemiology and Demographics\nThe incidence of DRESS syndrome is approximately 10 to 100 per 100,000 drug exposures. The case-fatality rate of DRESS syndrome is approximately 10%. DRESS syndrome has been reported among patients of all ages with no gender or racial predilection.\n\n【8】 #Risk Factors\nThere are no established risk factors in the development of DRESS syndrome. Possible risk factors in the development of DRESS syndrome include positive family history and rapid dose escalation of the triggering agent.\n\n【9】 #Screening\nScreening for DRESS syndrome in the general population is not recommended.\n\n【10】 #Natural History, Complications and Prognosis\nDRESS syndrome is characterized by a prolonged latency period (2-8 weeks following the administration of triggering drug). If left untreated, DRESS syndrome self-resolves following the discontinuation of the triggering drug in the majority of cases, but clinical manifestations may persist up to 3 months and the long-term sequelae have not yet been identified. Complications of DRESS syndrome include visceral organ involvement and long-term autoimmune diseases. The prognosis of DRESS syndrome is generally good, and the case-fatality rate is approximately 10%. Factors associated with worse prognosis have not yet been established.\n\n【11】 ## Diagnostic Criteria\nThere is no gold standard for the diagnosis of DRESS syndrome. Two diagnostic criteria have been proposed: The RegiSCAR criteria and the Japanese Consensus Group criteria.\n\n【12】 ## History and Symptoms\nCommon symptoms of DRESS syndrome rash and fever.\n\n【13】 ## Physical Examination\nCommon physical examination findings of patients with DRESS syndrome include high-grade fever, diffuse exanthematous eruption, lymphadenopathy, facial edema, abdominal tenderness, and hepatomegaly.\n\n【14】 ## Laboratory Findings\nLaboratory findings of patients with DRESS syndrome usually differ depending on the organ involvement. Common Lab findings include anemia, eosinophilia, atypical lymphocytosis, monocytosis, and thrombocytopenia.\n\n【15】 ## Other Diagnostic Studies\nOther diagnostic studies for DRESS syndrome include elevated anti-HHV-6 antibody due to viral reactivation, positive lymphocyte activation test, patch testing, and possibly rechallenging of the suspected drug.\n\n【16】 ## Medical Therapy\nDrug withdrawal is the first step in the management of DRESS syndrome. Supportive care is considered the mainstay of therapy, and hospitalization and administration of pharmacologic agents is usually necessary. Medical therapy for the management of DRESS syndrome usually include topical and/or systemic corticosteroids, antipyretic agents, and symptomatic management of exfoliative dermatitis (fluids, nutritional support, management of electrolyte imbalances, and sepsis prevention). Additional therapies have been attempted with variable success, including the use of N-acetylcysteine, intravenous immunoglobulins, and cyclosporin.\n\n【17】 ## Primary Prevention\nThere are no established measures for the primary prevention of DRESS syndrome. Primary prevention measures may include slow dose escalation of drugs (e.g. anticonvulsants), genetic counseling to patients with affected relatives, and in vitro impaired detoxification testing.\n\n【18】 ## Secondary Prevention\nSecondary preventive measures to avoid DRESS syndrome include avoidance of drug re-exposure, screening for cross-reacting agents using in vitro lymphocyte toxicity assays, and possibly desensitization techniques.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Every health condition can be assigned to a unique category and given a code, up to six characters long. Such categories can include a set of similar diseases.\nThe International Classification of Diseases is published by the World Health Organization. The ICD is used world-wide for morbidity and mortality statistics, reimbursement systems and automated decision support in medicine. This system is designed to promote international comparability in the collection, processing, classification, and presentation of these statistics. The ICD is a core classification of the WHO Family of International Classifications (WHO-FIC).\nSince the 1990s, the APA and WHO have worked to bring the DSM and the relevant sections of ICD into concordance, but some differences remain.\n\n【2】 #History\nIn 1893, a French physician, Jacques Bertillon, introduced the Bertillon Classification of Causes of Death at the International Statistical Institute in Chicago. A number of countries adopted Dr. Bertillon’s system, and in 1898, the American Public Health Association (APHA) recommended that the registrars of Canada, Mexico, and the United States also adopt it. The APHA also recommended revising the system every ten years to ensure the system remained current with medical practice advances. As a result, the first international conference to revise the International Classification of Causes of Death convened in 1900; with revisions occurring every ten years thereafter. At that time the classification system was contained in one book, which included an Alphabetic Index as well as a Tabular List. The book was small compared with current coding texts.\nThe revisions that followed contained minor changes, until the sixth revision of the classification system. With the sixth revision, the classification system expanded to two volumes. The sixth revision included morbidity and mortality conditions, and its title was modified to reflect the changes: Manual of International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Injuries and Causes of Death (ICD). Prior to the sixth revision, responsibility for ICD revisions fell to the Mixed Commission, a group composed of representatives from the International Statistical Institute and the Health Organization of the League of Nations. In 1948, the World Health Organization (WHO) assumed responsibility for preparing and publishing the revisions to the ICD every ten years. WHO sponsored the seventh and eighth revisions in 1957 and 1968, respectively.\n\n【3】 ## ICD-9\nThe ICD-9 was published by the WHO in 1977. At this time, the U.S This extension was called \"ICD-9-CM\", with the CM standing for \"Clinical Modification\".\nICD-9 consists of two or three volumes:\n- Volumes 1 and 2 contain diagnosis codes. (Volume 1 is a tabular listing, and volume 2 is an index.) Extended for ICD-9-CM\n- Volume 3 contains procedure codes. ICD-9-CM only\nAccording to the World Health Organization Department of Knowledge Management and Sharing, the WHO no longer publishes or distributes the ICD-9 which is now public domain.\n\n【4】 ## ICD-9-CM\nThe International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) is based on the World Health Organization's Ninth Revision, International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9). ICD-9-CM is the official system of assigning codes to diagnoses and procedures associated with hospital utilization in the United States.\nThe National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services are the U.S. governmental agencies responsible for overseeing all changes and modifications to the ICD-9-CM.\n\n【5】 ## ICD-10\nWork on ICD-10 began in 1983 and was completed in 1992 .\nAdoption was relatively swift in most of the world, but not in the United States. Since 1988, the USA had required ICD-9-CM codes for Medicare and Medicaid claims, and most of the rest of the American medical industry followed suit.\nOn 1 January 1999 the ICD-10 (without clinical extensions) was adopted for reporting mortality, but ICD-9-CM was still used for morbidity. Meanwhile, NCHS received permission from the WHO to create a clinical modification of the ICD-10, and has produced drafts of the following two systems:\n- ICD-10-CM, for diagnosis codes, is intended to replace volumes 1 and 2. A draft was completed in 2003.\nBoth ICD-10-CM and ICD-10-PCS became mandatory for Medicare and Medicaid submissions as of Oct 1, 2015, and ICD-9 coding was completely deprecated. All US commercial health insurance carriers started accepting ICD-10 coding on the same date.\nOther countries have created their own extensions to ICD-10. For example, Australia introduced their first edition of \"ICD-10-AM\" in 1998, and Canada introduced \"ICD-10-CA\" in 2000.\n\n【6】 ## ICD-11\nThe first draft of the ICD-11 system is expected in 2008, with publication following by 2011 and in 2013+ implementation will take place. WHO has announced that it will apply Web 2.0 principles for the first time to revise the ICD. The ICD revision process will be open to all comers willing to register, back their suggestions with evidence from medical literature and participate in online debate over proposed changes.\n\n【7】 #Current use\nICD has become the most widely used statistical classification system in the world The original revisions of ICD also did not provide procedure codes for classification of operative or diagnostic procedures. As a result, interested persons in the United States began to develop their own adaptation of ICD for use in the United States.\nHospitals and other healthcare facilities index healthcare data by referring and adhering to a classification system published by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services: International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM). The Clinical Modification or CM system was developed and implemented in order to better describe the clinical picture of the patient. The CM codes are more precise than those needed only for statistical groupings and trend analysis. The diagnosis component of ICD-9-CM is completely consistent with ICD-9 codes.\nNote that ICD-10 was adopted in 1999 for reporting mortality, but the ICD-9-CM remains the data standard for reporting morbidity. Revisions of the ICD-10 have progressed to incorporate both clinical code (ICD-10-CM) and procedure code (ICD-10-PCS) with the revisions completed in 2003.\n\n【8】 ## Public data reporting\n- International health statistics are available at the WHO Statistical Information System (WHOSIS).\n\n【9】 #Mental and behavioral disorders\nThis has developed alongside the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and the two manuals seek to use the same codes. There are significant differences, however, such as the ICD including personality disorders on the same axis as other mental disorders, unlike the DSM\n\n【10】 #USA\nThe years for which causes of death in the United States have been classified by each revision as follows:\n- ICD-1 - 1900", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

A doseresponse curve of PT and aPTT using dabigatran, apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban calibrators may assist in the local interpretation of these assays.  Drug overdose or bioaccumulation may elevate the PT and aPTT. ‡ TCT is very sensitive to presence of dabigatran and even low (potentially negligible) plasma levels may lead to elevated TCT results. - Reagent and dose dependent\n\n【2】 #EFFECT OF DABIGATRAN ON COAGULATION TESTS:\nThere is currently no routinely available laboratory test that can reliably assess the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran in a manner similar to how the INR is used to assess adequacy of warfarin therapy or how the aPTT is used to monitor intravenous (IV) unfractionated heparin (UFH) therapy. Therefore, these laboratory tests should NOT be used to monitor the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran.\n- Dabigatran is a direct thrombin inhibitor. It has a peak effect 1-3 hours after oral intake and, if testing is done within this time period, it often leads to an elevated PT/INR, aPTT and TCT. For example, soon after dabigatran intake, the INR may be slightly elevated to ~1.5-1.8 ,normal: 0.8-1 After this peak effect period, the effect of dabigatran on the PT/INR and aPTT diminishes, although there will be a prolonged effect on the TCT, which is the most sensitive test to detect the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran. - The relationship between dabigatran anticoagulant effect and any of the routine laboratory tests of coagulation is variable, depending on the reagent sensitivity. - Commercially available dilute thrombin time (dTT) assays, Ecarin-based assays or chromogenic anti-Factor IIa assays can be used to quantify the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran and may be considered for patients\n\n【3】 #WHAT DO NORMAL COAGULATION TESTS MEAN IN DABIGATRAN-TREATED PATIENTS?\n- In some dabigatran-treated patients, the aPTT remains normal in the presence of dabigatran in the on-therapy range. - A normal TCT excludes the presence of significant dabigatran concentrations and is the most sensitive way to completely exclude residual effect of dabigatran; however, the TCT may be elevated in the presence of clinically insignificant levels of dabigatran, sometimes for a prolonged period of time following last dose of dabigatran. Moreover, the TCT is not a widely available test.\n\n【4】 #EFFECT OF APIXABAN, EDOXABAN, AND RIVAROXABAN ON COAGULATION TESTS:\nThere is currently no routinely available laboratory test that can reliably assess the anticoagulant effect of apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban in a manner similar to how the INR is used to assess the adequacy of warfarin therapy or how the aPTT is used to monitor IV UFH therapy. Therefore, these laboratory tests should NOT be used to monitor the anticoagulant effect of apixaban, edoxaban, or rivaroxaban.\n- Apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban are factor Xa inhibitors. Edoxaban and rivaroxaban may affect the PT/INR and aPTT but have no effect on the TCT. Apixaban has a minimal effect on PT/INR and aPTT and no effect on the TCT. However, the effect on the PT/INR is variable, depending on the sensitivity of the PT or aPTT reagent used. - Apixaban achieves peak plasma concentration approximately 3 hours after ingestion. Even if testing is done at this time, the effect of apixaban on PT/INR and aPTT is much less pronounced than for edoxaban and rivaroxaban and these tests are not useful to assess the intensity of apixaban's anticoagulant effect. TCT is not affected. - Edoxaban has a peak effect approximately 1-2 hours after ingestion. It prolongs PT/INR and aPTT in a dose dependent manner but both assays are insufficiently sensitive at low therapeutic levels and edoxaban effect is reagent-dependent. Therefore, a normal PT/INR or aPTT does not exclude the presence of on therapy or greater edoxaban concentrations. TCT is not affected. - Rivaroxaban has a peak effect 1-3 hours after oral intake and, if testing is done within this time, it often leads to an elevated PT/INR and aPTT After this peak effect, the effect of rivaroxaban on PT/INR and aPTT diminishes but there may be a residual effect on these tests even at trough levels (24 hours after last intake). A normal PT/INR or aPTT does not exclude the presence of on therapy or greater rivaroxaban concentrations. TCT is not affected. - Specific anti-Xa assays with drug-specific calibrators (different than those used to assess low molecular weight heparin  activity) can be used to quantify the anticoagulant effect of apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban Anti-Xa assays calibrated for LMWHs or UFH should NOT be used to assess for the anticoagulant effect of apixaban, edoxaban, or rivaroxaban. In addition, antithrombin supplemented anti-factor Xa methods should not be used as these methods tend to overestimate DOAC levels and are not validated by the manufacturers.\n\n【5】 #WHAT DO NORMAL COAGULATION TESTS MEAN IN APIXABAN, EDOXABAN,  RIVAROXABAN-TREATED PATIENTS?\n- In apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban-treated patients, a normal PT/INR and aPTT may be found despite the presence of therapeutic levels of the drug. No routine coagulation test can reliably exclude a residual anticoagulant effect.\n\n【6】 #LABORATORY TESTING IN PATIENTS RECEIVING A DOAC WHO ARE BLEEDING:\nLaboratory testing may help in the management of patients who are bleeding, especially if it is lifethreatening. The timing of the last dose of the anticoagulant and assessment of renal function should be obtained to help interpret laboratory results. Patients with moderate or severe bleeding should urgently have the following laboratory tests: CBC, PT/INR, aPTT, creatinine.\n\n【7】 #Dabigatran-treated patients who are bleeding:\n- In bleeding patients with a highly elevated aPTT (e.g. greater than 80 sec) and/or an unmeasurable TCT ,i.e - If the aPTT is normal in a dabigatran-treated patient, it excludes above on-therapy levels of dabigatran but does not exclude on therapy levels. As discussed in the Clinical Guide: NOACs/DOACs: Peri-operative Management, there is no need for routine laboratory testing outside of what would be done prior to any surgery/procedure.\n\n【8】 #Dabigatran-treated patients:\n- For most elective surgery/procedures, dabigatran should be stopped prior to surgery based on a calculated creatinine clearance and the bleeding risk associated with the procedure.  the Clinical Guide: NOACs/DOACs: Perioperative Management. No coagulation testing prior to surgery is recommended.\nApixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban-treated patients:\n\n【9】 #OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:\n- For each of the DOACs, serum creatinine and estimated creatinine clearance ,e.g. using the\nCockroft-Gault equation should be done at baseline, at least yearly, and in clinical situations when renal function may deteriorate because these drugs are at least partially renally cleared and will accumulate in renal insufficiency. - If specific assays for quantifying DOAC activity are available in your center and you feel there is a benefit in determining this activity in a specific patient, discussion with the coagulation laboratory director is recommended in order to evaluate the relevance of the indication and guidance as to the interpretation of the results. - While new assays are being offered, such as TEG and ROTEM and other point-of-care testing, the utility of these assays in the measurement of DOACs is limited and should be interpreted with caution.\nIf you have any specific questions about any medical matter, you should consult your doctor or other professional healthcare providers, and as such you should never delay seeking medical advice, disregard medical advice or discontinue medical treatment because of the information contained herein.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

A TFT panel typically includes thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH, thyrotropin) and thyroxine (T4), and triiodothyronine (T3) depending on local laboratory policy.TFTs may be requested if a patient is thought to suffer from hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) or hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) or to monitor the effectiveness of either thyroid-suppression or hormone replacement therapy. It is also requested routinely in conditions linked to thyroid disease, such as atrial fibrillation4-4.5 mIU/L7-1.8 ng/dL (9-23 pmol/L) and that for FT3 is 2.3-5.0 pg/mL (35-77 pmol/L).

If patients and clinicians consider upadacitinib to be one of a range of suitable options, choose the least expensive treatment (taking into account drug administration costs, dose needed and frequency, and product price per dose).\nWhy the committee made these recommendations\nStandard treatments for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis after conventional treatments are biological treatments (adalimumab, golimumab, infliximab, ustekinumab or vedolizumab) or tofacitinib.\nClinical trial evidence shows that upadacitinib is more effective than placebo for treating moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis. There is no direct evidence comparing upadacitinib with treatments that are offered after conventional treatment. Indirect comparison suggests that upadacitinib is likely to be at least as effective as the treatments it was compared with.\nThe most likely cost-effectiveness estimates for upadacitinib compared with other treatments are within the range NICE normally considers an acceptable use of NHS resources. So, upadacitinib is recommended\n\n【3】 #Information about upadacitinib\n\n【4】 #Marketing authorisation indication\nUpadacitinib (Rinvoq, AbbVie) is indicated for 'the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who have had an inadequate response, lost response or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a biological agent'.\n\n【5】 #Dosage in the marketing authorisation\nThe dosage schedule is available in the summary of product characteristics for upadacitinib.\n\n【6】 The price per 28‑tablet pack is £805.56 for upadacitinib 15 mg and £1,281.54 for upadacitinib 30 mg (all prices excluding VAT; BNF online accessed October 2022). The estimated cost for 6 weeks of induction treatment (45 mg) is £3,131 based on list price (excluding VAT). The estimated cost of maintenance treatment is £10,472 at standard dose (15 mg) or £16,660 at high dose (30 mg) per person per year based on list price (excluding VAT).\nThe company has a commercial arrangement. This makes upadacitinib available to the NHS with a discount. The size of the discount is commercial in confidenc\n\n【7】 #Committee discussion\nThe evaluation committee considered evidence submitted by AbbVie, a review of this submission by the external assessment group (EAG), and responses from stakeholders\n\n【8】 ## Treatment pathway\nUpadacitinib is a type of treatment called a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor. It has a marketing authorisation for treating moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis when conventional or biological treatment cannot be tolerated, or if the disease has not responded well enough or stopped responding to treatment. The committee noted that choice of treatment for ulcerative colitis is highly individualised based on a range of factors. The company's submission considered 2 subgroups:\n'Biologic-naive' – people who have had a conventional treatment and their disease did not respond to it or they could not tolerate it, but they have not had a biological treatment (a tumour necrosis factor -alpha inhibitor, vedolizumab or ustekinumab) or tofacitinib (another JAK inhibitor).\n'Biologic-experienced' – people who have had a conventional and biological treatment or tofacitinib, and their disease did not respond to it or they could not tolerate it. The committee acknowledged there are other non-biological treatments that have since been recommended for these populations and not considered in this evaluation, and there may be more in the future. The committee understood the treatment subgroup definitions but noted they may need reconsideration in the future to avoid clinical confusion. Patient and clinical experts noted that upadacitinib, as an oral treatment, offers additional benefit over some of the current treatment options because it can be taken at home. Clinical experts noted that some treatments are started in hospital because they need to be given intravenously. They suggested that upadacitinib is a step-change in managing moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis. They noted that because it performed well, it should not be reserved for after failure of biological treatment. The committee concluded that the company's categorisation based on biological treatment experience was appropriate.\n\n【9】 ## Data sources and generalisability\nThe clinical-effectiveness evidence for upadacitinib comes from placebo-controlled, double-blind randomised controlled trials:\nInduction treatment: the U‑ACHIEVE (n=474) and U‑ACCOMPLISH (n=522) trials included people with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis. They were randomised to have upadacitinib (45 mg once daily) or placebo. The primary outcome was clinical remission, measured using the adapted Mayo score. Secondary outcomes included endoscopic improvement and remission, clinical response (adapted Mayo score), histologic–endoscopic mucosal improvement, mucosal healing, lack of bowel urgency and abdominal pain. All outcomes were measured at 8‑weeks follow-up. People whose disease had an inadequate response at week 8 had a further 8 weeks of induction treatment.\nMaintenance treatment: the U‑ACHIEVE maintenance trial included 451 people whose disease clinically responded to upadacitinib in the induction trials. People took either upadacitinib (15 mg or 30 mg) or placebo, once daily. The primary outcome was clinical remission (adapted Mayo score) at week 52. Secondary outcomes included endoscopic improvement and remission, maintenance of clinical remission, corticosteroid-free clinical remission, histologic–endoscopic mucosal improvement, mucosal healing, lack of bowel urgency and abdominal pain. Clinical experts noted that these studies included people whose disease had not responded to therapies currently available in the NHS. The committee concluded that the trials are adequate and generalisable to UK clinical practice.\n\n【10】 ## Clinical effectiveness\nAt the end of induction treatment, the rate of remission was statistically significantly higher in the upadacitinib 45 mg group than the placebo group (adjusted treatment difference compared with placebo of 22% and 29% in the 2 studies) for the overall population. Remission rates were consistent in the biologic-naive and biologic-exposed subgroups. At week 52 of the maintenance phase, a statistically significantly greater proportion of people who had upadacitinib were in remission compared with those who had placebo (adjusted treatment difference compared with placebo of 31%  and 39% ). Remission rates were consistent in the biologic-naive and biologic-exposed subgroups. Clinical experts noted that the trials show upadacitinib will provide clinically meaningful benefits. The committee concluded that upadacitinib is more effective than placebo at inducing and maintaining remission.\n\n【11】 ## Safety profile\nIn the induction trials, the most common adverse events with upadacitinib were creatine phosphokinase increase, acne and nasopharyngitis. In the maintenance trial these were nasopharyngitis, worsening of ulcerative colitis and creatine phosphokinase increase. Discontinuation from the trial because of adverse events was more common with placebo than with upadacitinib. There were no deaths in any trial. The committee was aware of the European Medicines Agency safety committee review of JAK inhibitors for inflammatory disorders (including upadacitinib for ulcerative colitis). This is because a clinical trial of tofacitinib in rheumatoid arthritis showed people with risk of heart disease were more likely to experience a major cardiovascular problem and had a higher risk of developing cancer with tofacitinib than TNF-alpha inhibitors. The company submitted a summary of the most recent data from a long-term extension study of upadacitinib (U‑ACTIVATE). No new safety risks were identified in people who completed maintenance treatment in U‑ACHIEVE and continued upadacitinib in the extension study. The committee concluded that based on the evidence presented, upadacitinib has an acceptable safety profile.\n\n【12】 ## Company network meta-analyses\nBecause there were no head-to-head studies, the company did network meta-analyses of 2 randomised placebo-controlled trials of upadacitinib (U‑ACHIEVE induction and maintenance, and U‑ACCOMPLISH induction) and 18 trials of comparators. The network meta-analyses for efficacy endpoints assessed clinical remission and clinical response in 2 subgroups:\nFor the biologic-naive subgroup, the analysis estimated the relative efficacy of upadacitinib compared with adalimumab, golimumab, infliximab, tofacitinib, ustekinumab and vedolizumab.\nFor the biologic-exposed subgroup, the analysis estimated the relative efficacy of upadacitinib compared with adalimumab, tofacitinib, ustekinumab and vedolizumab.The safety network meta-analysis assessed the rate of serious infection in the overall population during induction treatment with upadacitinib compared with adalimumab, golimumab, infliximab, tofacitinib, ustekinumab and vedolizumab. The EAG noted that the company's network meta-analyses had some unresolvable technical issues with an unclear impact that must be considered when interpreting the results:\nFor all networks, the consistency assumption could not be tested formally.\nThe results of the network meta-analysis for the maintenance phase were less reliable than those for the induction phase.\nThe company and EAG preferred different approaches to generating the network meta-analyses results. The EAG was not satisfied with alternative approaches it explored and proposed that clinical opinion be sought on the plausibility of the results. The committee noted the wide credible intervals leading to uncertainty in the results. The company stated that its results were supported by evidence from 2 recently published network meta-analyses of treatment for moderate to severe ulcerative colitis . Clinical experts agreed that these published analyses broadly reached the same conclusions as the company's analyses. They noted that the published analyses also included filgotinib and ozanimod, which were recently recommended for treating moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (NICE's technology appraisal guidance on filgotinib and ozanimod). The committee noted that filgotinib and ozanimod have not yet been widely used in clinical practice and were not included as comparators in this appraisal. The committee concluded that the results of the company's network meta-analyses are plausible and appropriate for decision making.\n\n【13】 ## Results of network meta-analyses\nThe company's network meta-analyses suggested that upadacitinib is as effective and sometimes more effective than comparators in the biologic-naive and biologic-exposed subgroups. The company considers the results confidential so they cannot be reported here. The company's safety network analysis suggested that upadacitinib has a low risk of serious infection. The committee concluded that upadacitinib was at least as effective as its comparators, and has a similar low risk of serious infection.\n\n【14】 ## Company's modelling approach\nThe company estimated the cost effectiveness of upadacitinib using a model with a hybrid structure (the induction phase was modelled using a decision tree and the maintenance phase was modelled using a Markov structure). The company provided cost-effectiveness estimates for the biologic-naive and biologic-exposed subgroups. The company's model structure was similar to those used in earlier ulcerative colitis technology appraisals. It included health states defined by remission and response without remission (in which people in the model had maintenance treatment with upadacitinib and comparators), active ulcerative colitis (with no biological drug treatment), and surgery and post-surgery. The company base case did not include a subsequent biological therapy. The EAG stated that it was not plausible for the company to assume that after having only 1 treatment people would move to an 'active ulcerative colitis' health state for the remaining duration of the model. Instead, in clinical practice, people would either be offered surgery within 12 months or other drug treatments. Clinical advisers to the EAG suggested these other medicines may include the treatment which previously gave the best symptom relief, even if the person's disease had not responded to it. The committee noted that the company's approach of not modelling further treatment after first-line treatment exaggerates the differences between treatments over a lifetime. The committee agreed that the company's model did not reflect NHS clinical practice. The committee added that it expects company submissions in future appraisals to reflect more up-to-date practice, recognising there are many treatments available for ulcerative colitis. This should include a structured decision-analytic model for ulcerative colitis that realistically represents what happens in NHS clinical practice. The committee concluded that the company's modelled treatment pathway did not reflect NHS clinical practice.\n\n【15】 ## EAG adjustment of the model\nThe EAG preferred to adapt the company's model using an alternative health state, 'on subsequent treatment', after treatment failure in its base case. In this, people had a 'basket' of biologic treatments (the comparators). The committee noted that this alternative approach led to different costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) being accrued. The EAG acknowledged that its own modelling approach had some limitations. It did not include surgery and it allowed for a more expensive second-line treatment option than might be used in clinical practice. But it did more closely reflect NHS practice than the company's approach. The committee highlighted that a preferable model would include likely sequences of treatment that are used in NHS practice, but acknowledged that it is unlikely that data exists to populate such a model. The committee agreed that neither treatment pathway reflected NHS practice but concluded that the EAG's simplified adjustment of the model was preferred for decision making.\n\n【16】 ## Use of trial-based utility estimates\nThe company's utility values for remission, response without remission and active ulcerative colitis came from Woehl et al, The company noted that this was consistent with previous appraisals in ulcerative colitis. It suggested that utility values collected in real-world clinical practice (as done in Woehl et al. ) can provide more representative values of the population having treatment than those collected in clinical trials It noted that these utility estimates were mostly higher than in the source used by the company. The committee noted that the Woehl et al.  data used by the company had been considered in previous ulcerative colitis appraisals but that the reliability of the utility estimates had also been a source of discussion. The committee noted that utility values for remission, response without remission, and active ulcerative colitis health states were collected in upadacitinib trials and therefore could have been used. The committee concluded that using the upadacitinib trial-based utility estimates is preferred.\n\n【17】 ## Maintenance dose assumption\nThe committee recalled that upadacitinib maintenance treatment is 15 mg ('standard') or 30 mg ('high') daily dosing. The company and EAG agreed that, as was done for comparator drugs, it would be assumed that upadacitinib is prescribed in a 70:30 ratio of 'standard' to 'high' doses in the maintenance phase. The committee was concerned that this assumption was not based on evidence and that the true proportions of people who would have standard or high-dose levels of these treatments was uncertain. However, it noted that this assumption was consistent with the approach taken in NICE's technology appraisal guidance on ustekinumab. The committee reviewed alternative explorations of the ratio and noted these did not have a substantial impact on costs or effects. The committee concluded that some people have a high dose of maintenance treatment, but the proportion is uncertain.\n\n【18】 ## Company and EAG cost-effectiveness estimates\nFully incremental analyses were done on the company's and EAG's preferred base cases by prior biological treatment status. For the biologic-naive subgroup, the analyses compared upadacitinib with adalimumab, adalimumab biosimilar, golimumab, infliximab, infliximab biosimilar, tofacitinib, ustekinumab and vedolizumab. For the biologic-exposed subgroup, upadacitinib was compared with adalimumab, adalimumab biosimilar, tofacitinib, ustekinumab and vedolizumab. The committee recalled that there was some uncertainty associated with the results of the network meta-analyses . It also recalled that neither the company's nor the EAG's model truly reflected NHS clinical practice but that the EAG's simplified approach was preferred . The proportion of people who have high-dose maintenance treatment in clinical practice is also uncertain . Looking at the cost-effectiveness results from the EAG's model, upadacitinib had the greatest net health benefit suggesting that it is a cost-effective use of NHS resources compared with existing NICE-recommended treatments. However, the committee noted that the differences between costs and QALYs were very small, and noted the uncertainties described above. The committee agreed it was likely that upadacitinib is a cost-effective use of NHS resources when conventional or biological treatments are not tolerated or are not working well enough. The committee concluded that upadacitinib is considered cost effective for treating moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis.\n\n【19】 ## Choosing the most appropriate treatment\nThe committee recalled that treatment of ulcerative colitis is highly individualised based on a range of factors. It also recalled that upadacitinib is likely to be a cost-effective use of NHS resources. But it noted that because the cost-effectiveness estimates were similar it could not consider it in preference to other options. This is because the value that each provides is uncertain and is likely to vary from case to case. It recalled that a range of treatments are already available for people with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis, including some that have not yet been widely used in clinical practice . The committee concluded that healthcare professionals should choose the most appropriate treatment after discussing the advantages and disadvantages of the treatments available with the person having treatment. If patients and clinicians consider upadacitinib to be one of a range of suitable options, they should choose the least expensive treatment (taking into account drug administration costs, dose needed and frequency, and product price per dose). This may vary from person to person because of differences in how the drugs are taken and treatment schedules.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "387327e1-cc77-4af8-92fb-af0e94239679", "title": null, "text": "【0】 Public domain\n\n【1】 #Overview\nPublic domain comprises the body of knowledge and innovation (especially creative works such as writing, art, music, and inventions) in relation to which no person or other legal entity can establish or maintain proprietary interests within a particular legal jurisdiction. This body of information and creativity is considered to be part of a common cultural and intellectual heritage, which, in general, anyone may use or exploit, whether for commercial or non-commercial purposes. About 15 percent of all books are in the public domain, including 10 percent of all books that are still in print.\nThe extent to which members of the public may use or exploit the work is limited to the extent of the proprietary interests in the relevant legal jurisdiction\n\n【2】 #No legal restriction on use\nA creative work is said to be in the public domain if there are no laws which restrict its use by the public at large. For instance, a work may be in the public domain if no laws establish proprietary rights over the work, or if the work or its subject matter are specifically excluded from existing laws.\nBecause proprietary rights are founded in national laws, an item may be public domain in one jurisdiction but not another. For instance, some works of literature are public domain in the United States but not in the European Union and vice versa.\n\n【3】 The Bible and the inventions of Archimedes are in the public domain\nA sui generis database rights regime is in place in the European Union.\n\n【4】 #Expiration\nWhen terms expire, the work or invention is released into public domain, in most countries, this is 20 years. A trademark registration may be renewed and remain in force indefinitely provided the trademark is used, but could otherwise become generic.\n\n【5】 - The work was created and first published before January 1, 1923, or at least 95 years before January 1 of the current year, whichever is later;\n- The last surviving author died at least 70 years before January 1 of the current year;\n(This must be a condition because the exact numbers in the other conditions depend on the state of the law at any given moment.)\n\n【6】 S\n\n【7】 ## United States law\nlaw in the United States has changed several times. Although it is held under Feist v\"\nWorks created by an agency of the United States government are public domain at the moment of creation.  Examples include military journalism, federal court opinions (but not necessarily state court opinions), congressional committee reports, and census data  Even public domain documents may have their availability limited by laws limiting the spread of classified information.\n\n【8】 ### Since 1978\n\n【9】 ### 1964 to 1977\n\n【10】 ### Sound recordings\nRecordings fixed before February 15, 1972, are still covered, to varying degrees, by common law or state statutes.  Any rights or remedies under state law for sound recordings fixed before February 15, 1972, are not annulled or limited by the 1976  Act until February 15, 2067.\n\n【11】 ### Term extensions\n\"\n\n【12】 ## British law\nBritish government works are restricted by either Crown  or Parliamentary . Unpublished Crown  documents become public domain at the end of the year 125 years after they were first created Since the legislation became law on 1 August 1989, no unpublished works will become public domain under this provision until 2039. Parliamentary  documents become public domain at the end of the year 50 years after they were published. Crown  is waived on some government works provided that certain conditions are met.\n\n【13】 ## Laws of Canada, Australia, and other Commonwealth nations\nCanada and New Zealand have not, as of 2006, passed similar twenty-year extensions\nHence, in Australia works by authors who died before 1955 are still in the public domain.\nAs a result, works ranging from Peter Pan to the stories of H. P. Lovecraft are public domain in both countries.\nBoth have a version of Crown  which lasts for 50 years from publication. New Zealand also has Crown , but has a much greater time length, at 100 years from the date of publication\n\n【14】 ## Thai law\nThai state documents are public domain.\n\n【15】 ## Japanese law\nHence, even when some materials are said to be \"in the public domain\" there can be some use restrictions\nMany pre-1953 both Japanese and non-Japanese films are considered to be in the public domain in Japan.\n\n【16】 ## Examples\nExamples of inventions whose patents have expired include the inventions of Thomas Edison.\nIt wasn't until 1993 when Republic Pictures relied on the 1990 United States Supreme Court ruling in Stewart v As a result, only NBC is currently licensed to show the film on U.S. network television, the colourized versions have been withdrawn and Republic got exclusive video rights to the film (under license with Artisan Entertainment). Rights to It's a Wonderful Life now belong to Paramount Pictures.\nThese are Disorder in the Court, Brideless Groom, Malice in the Palace, and Sing a Song of Six Pants. Other features and films from the Stooges are known to be in public domain as well.\nSeveral episodes of The Lucy Show are similarly in the public domain.\nSome works may never fully lapse into the public domain, such as the play Peter Pan by J. M. Barrie  J. M. Barrie had bequeathed the rights to Peter Pan to the hospital in perpetuity as an endowment.\n\n【17】 of interest\nLaws may make some types of works and inventions ineligible for monopoly; such works immediately enter the public domain upon publication\nFor example: U.SS.C.  105, releases all works created by the U.S. government into the public domain. U.S Agreements that Germany signed at the end of World War I released such trademarks as \"aspirin\" and \"heroin\" into the public domain in many areas.\nAnother example would be Charles Darwin's theory of evolution. Being an abstract idea it has therefore never been patentable. After Darwin constructed his theory, he did not disclose it for over a decade . He could have kept his manuscript in his desk drawer forever but once he published the idea, the idea itself entered public domain\n\n【18】 ##\nThis was true prior to March 1, 1989 (according to the USA  office), but is no longer the case\nIt is commonly believed by non-lawyers that it is impossible to put a work into the public domain Congress may not have felt it necessary to codify this part of the law, because abandoning property (like a tract of land) to the public domain has traditionally been a matter of common law, rather than statute\n\n【19】 ### Statutory law\nR. 5498 of the 101st Congress. Although most of the Act was codified into Title 17 of the U.S. Code, there is a very interesting provision relating to \"public domain shareware\" which was not, and is therefore often overlooked.\nSec. 105. Recordation of Shareware\n\n【20】 (b) MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS; PUBLICATION OF INFORMATION- The Register of s is authorized to maintain current, separate records relating to the recordation of documents under subsection (a), and to compile and publish at periodic intervals information relating to such recordations. Such publications shall be offered for sale to the public at prices based on the cost of reproduction and distribution.\n\n【21】 All regulations established by the Register are subject to the approval of the Librarian of Congress.\nOne purpose of this legislation appears to be to allow \"public domain shareware\" to be filed at the Library of Congress, presumably so that the shareware would be more widely disseminated. Therefore, one way to release computer software into the public domain might be to make the filing and pay the $20 fee. This could have the effect of \"certifying\" that the author intended to release the software into the public domain. It does not seem that registration is necessary to release the software into the public domain, because the law does not state that public domain status is conferred by registration. Judicial rulings supports this conclusion, see below.\nBy comparing paragraph (a) and (c), one can see that Congress distinguishes \"public domain\" shareware as a special kind of shareware Therefore, one reasonable inference is that Congress intended that authors of shareware would have the power to release their programs into the public domain. This interpretation is followed by the  Office in 37 C.F.R.  201.26.\nRather the language speaks to getting rid of formalities in order to comply with Berne (non-compliance had become a severe impediment in trade negotiations) and making registration and marking optional, but encouraged. A fair reading is that the Berne Act did not intend to take away author's right to dedicate works to the public domain, which they had (by default) under the 1976 Act.\nAny of these interpretations are possible:\n- No effect This interpretation is probably wrong, because then an author would lose the right to his \"termination right,\" which in practical terms means a royalty Because the Captain America case (Marvel v. Simon) showed that this termination right cannot be alienated before death, this interpretation is almost certainly wrong.\n- Strong effect. Only a company holding a work for hire can release the work into the public domain\n\n【22】 ### Case law\nAnother form of support comes from the seminal case Computer Associates Int'l v. Altai, 982 F.2d 693. In this case, it discusses the public domain.\n(c) Elements Taken from the Public Domain\nClosely related to the non-protectability of scenes a faire, is material found in the public domain . We see no reason to make an exception to this rule for elements of a computer program that have entered the public domain by virtue of freely accessible program exchanges and the like , expression that is, if not standard, then commonplace in the computer software industry.’“. Thus, a court must also filter out this material from the allegedly infringed program before it makes the final inquiry in its substantial similarity analysis.\nThis decision holds that computer software may enter the public domain through \"freely accessible program exchanges and the like,\" or by becoming \"commonplace in the computer industry.\" Relying only on this decision, it is unclear whether an author can dedicate his work to the public domain simply by labeling it as such, or whether dedication to the public domain requires widespread dissemination.\n\n【23】 ### Treatise analysis\nThe treatise cited (Nimmer), holds in its most recent edition:\n\n【24】 An enormous amount of public domain software exists in the computer industry, perhaps to a much greater extent than is true of other fields. Nationwide computer \"bulletin boards\" permit users to share and distribute programs. In addition, computer programming texts may contain examples of actual code that programmers are encouraged to copy.\nProgrammers often will build existing public domain software into their works. The courts thus must be careful to limit protection only to those elements of the program that represent the author's original work.\nAlthough Computer Associates only mentioned the issue in passing, Nimmer observes that the public domain is particularly rich and valuable for computer programs. He seems to say that a computer program author who wishes to release his work into the public domain may either include it in a book as example code or post it on a \"bulletin board\" and encourage sharing and distribution\n\n【25】 ## Patent\nFor example, a chemistry journal publishing a formula prevents patenting the formula by anyone. This tactic was commonly used by Bell Labs. The famous Bell Labs Technical Journal was sent free of charge to the library of the U.S. Patent Office to establish a base of prior art without the inconvenience, cost, and hassle of filing patent applications for inventions of no immediate monetary value. (Unix was famously described in this journal.) This is sometimes called \"defensive disclosure\" - one way to make sure you are not later accused of infringing a patent on your own invention. There is an exception to this rule, however: in U.S. (not European) law, an inventor may file a patent claim up to one year after publishing a description (but not, of course, if someone else published or used it first).\nIn practice, patent examiners only consider other patents and the books they have in their library for prior art, largely because the patent office has an elaborate classification system for inventions. This means that an increasing number of issued patents may be invalid, based upon prior art that was not brought to the examiner's attention. Once a patent is issued, it is very expensive to invalidate. Publishing a description on a website as a preemptive disclosure does very little in a practical sense to release an invention to the public domain; it might still be considered \"patentable\", although erroneously. However, anyone aware of an omitted prior art citation in an issued patent may submit it to the US Patent Office and request a \"reexamination\" of the patent during the enforceable period of the patent (that is, its life plus statute of limitations). This may result in loss of some or all of the patent  on the invention, or it may backfire and actually strengthen the claims.\nAn applicant may also choose to file a Statutory Invention Registration, which has the same effect as a patent for prior art purposes. These SIRs are relatively expensive. These are used strategically by large companies to prevent competitors from obtaining a patent.\nThere is precious little case-law on this point. It is largely a dead letter.\nIf an inventor has an issued patent, there are several ways to release it to the public domain (other than simply letting it expire). First, he can fail to pay the maintenance fee the next time it is due, about every four years. Alternatively he can file a terminal disclaimer under 37 CFR 1.321 for a reasonable fee. The regulations explicitly say that the \"patentee may disclaim or dedicate to the public the entire term, or any terminal part of the term, of the patent granted. Such disclaimer is binding upon the grantee and its successors or assigns.\" Usually this is used during the application process to prevent another patent from a \"double patenting\" invalidation. Lastly, he may grant a patent license to the world, although the issue of revocability may raise its head again.\n\n【26】 ## Trade secret\nIf guarded properly, trade secrets are forever. A business may keep the formula to Coca-Cola a secret. However, once it is disclosed to the public, the former secret enters public domain, although an invention using the former secret may still be patentable in the United States if it is not barred by statute (including the on-sale bar).\nSome businesses choose to protect products, processes, and information by guarding them as trade secrets, rather than patenting them. Hershey Foods, Inc. for example, does not patent some of its processes, such as the recipe for Reese's, but rather maintains them as trade secrets, to prevent competitors from easily duplicating or learning from their invention disclosures.\nOne risk, however, is that anyone may reverse engineer a product and thus discover (and copy and publish) all of its secrets, to the extent they are not covered by other laws (e.g. patent, contract).\n\n【27】 ## Trademark\nA trademark registration is renewable. If a trademark owner wishes to do so, he may maintain a registration indefinitely by paying renewal fees, using the trademark and defending the registration.\nHowever, a trademark or brand can become unenforceable if it becomes the generic term for a particular type of product or service – a process called \"genericide.\" If a mark undergoes genericide, people are using the term generically, not as a trademark to exclusively identify the particular source of the product or service. One famous example is \"thermos\" in the United States.\nBecause trademarks are registered with governments, some countries or trademark registries may recognize a mark, while others may have determined that it is generic and not allowable as a trademark in that registry. For example, the drug \"acetylsalicylic acid\" (2-acetoxybenzoic acid) is better known as aspirin in the United States – a generic term. In Canada, however, \"aspirin\" is still a trademark of the German company Bayer. Bayer lost the trademark after World War I, when the mark was sold to an American firm. So many copycat products entered the marketplace during the war that it was deemed generic just three years later.\nTerms can be deemed \"generic\" in two ways. First, any potential mark can be deemed \"generic\" by a trademark registry, that refuses to register it. In this instance, the term has no secondary meaning that helps consumers identify the source of the product; the term serves no function as a \"mark\". Second, a mark, already in use, may be deemed generic by a court or registry after the mark is challenged as generic – this is known as \"genericide\". In this instance, the term previously had a secondary meaning, but lost its source-identifying function.\nTo avoid \"genericide\", a trademark owner must balance between trying to dominate the market, and dominating their market to such an extent that their product name defines the market If the product continues to dominate the market, eventually the trademark will become generic (\"thermos\").\nTrademarks currently thought to be in danger of being generic include Jell-O, Band-Aid, Rollerblade, Google, Spam, Hoover, and Sheetrock. Google vigorously defends its trademark rights. Although Hormel has resigned itself to genericide , it still fights attempts by other companies to register \"spam\" as a trademark in relation to computer products .\nWhen a trademark becomes generic, it is as if the mark were in the public domain.\nTrademarks which have been genericized in particular places include: Escalator, Trampoline, Raisin Bran, Linoleum, Dry Ice, Shredded Wheat (generic in US), Mimeograph, Yo-Yo, Kerosene, Cornflakes, Cube Steak, Lanolin, and High Octane,  as well as Aspirin (generic in the United States, but not in Canada), Allen wrench, Beaver Board, Masonite, Coke, Pablum, Styrofoam, Heroin, Bikini, Chyron, Weedwhacker, Kleenex, Linux (generic in Australia) and Zipper.\n\n【28】 ## Domain name\nPeople may buy and sell domain names. Sometimes, people advertise them as their own \"intellectual property\".\nA domain name never enters public domain. If nobody owns it, it simply doesn't exist.\n\n【29】 #Public domain and the Internet\nThe term \"public domain\" is often poorly understood and has created significant legal controversy. Historically, most parties attempting to address public domain issues fell into two camps:\n- Businesses and organizations who could devote staff to resolving legal conflicts through negotiation and the court system.\n- Individuals and organizations using materials covered by the fair use doctrine, reducing the need for substantial governmental or corporate resources to track down individual offenders.\nThis aggravated an already established but false belief that if something is available through a free source, it must be public domain. Once such material was available on the net, it could be perfectly copied among thousands or even millions of computers very quickly and essentially without cost.\n\n【30】 ## Freely obtained does not mean free to republish\nThese factors have reinforced the false notion that \"freely obtained\" means \"public domain.\" One could argue that the Internet is a publicly-available domain, not licensed or controlled by any individual, company, or government; therefore, everything on the Internet is public domain. This specious argument ignores the fact that licensing rights are not dependent on the means of distribution or consumer acquisition.If someone gives a person stolen merchandise, it is still stolen, even if the receiving party was not aware of it\n\n【31】 Another complication is that publishing exclusively on the Internet has become extremely popular But such laws were passed at a time when the focus was on materials that could not be as easily and cheaply reproduced as digital media, nor did they comprehend the ultimate impossibility of determining which set of electronic bits is original\nThe distribution of many types of Internet postings (particularly Usenet articles and messages sent to electronic mailing lists) inherently involves duplication.\n\n【32】 ## Furthering the public domain with the Internet\nMany people are using the Internet to contribute to the public domain, or make works in the public domain more accessible to more people. For example, Project Gutenberg and LibriVox coordinate the efforts of people who transcribe works in the public domain into electronic form. Some projects exist for the sole purpose of making material available into the public domain or under no-cost licenses.

The most important cause of secondary hyperparathyroidism is chronic renal failure. Other causes include rickets, malnutrition or malabsorption, and certain types of cancer.\n\n【2】 #What are the symptoms of Secondary hyperparathyroidism?\nSymptoms of secondary hyperparathyroidism include symptoms of chronic renal failure, malabsorption, rickets and underlying cancer. General symptoms are the following:\n- Weakness\n- Bone deformities\n\n【3】 - Osteomalacia, osteoporosis - Fractures\n\n【4】 #Who is at highest risk?\n- Kidney disease, chronic renal failure\n- Rickets\n- Malnutrition, malabsorption, vitamin D deficiency\n- Certain types of cancer\n\n【5】 #What causes Secondary hyperparathyroidism?\nThe parathyroid glands help control calcium use and removal by the body. They do this by producing parathyroid hormone, or PTH. PTH helps control calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D levels within the blood and bone.\nWhen calcium levels are too low, the body responds by increasing production of parathyroid hormone. This increase in parathyroid hormone causes more calcium to be taken from the bone and more calcium to be reabsorbed by the intestines and kidney.\nMedical conditions that cause low blood calcium levels or interfere with the body's ability to break down and remove phosphate can lead to secondary hyperparathyroidism. Too much phosphate causes changes in calcium levels.\nKidney failure is a common cause of secondary hyperparathyroidism. Kidney failure can interfere with the body's ability to remove phosphate.\nOther causes of secondary hyperparathyroidism may include:\n- Calcium deficiency\n- Not enough calcium in the diet\nToo much calcium loss in the urine\n- Conditions that make it hard for the body to break down phosphate, including:\n- Aluminum poisoning\nCertain types of cancer\nKidney disease\nMalnutrition\n- Malabsorption\n- Vitamin D disorders (often seen in children with malnutrition and older adults who do not get enough sunlight):\n- Problems absorbing vitamin D into the body (malabsorption)\nProblems breaking down vitamin D (due to the use of certain drugs)\nRickets\nToo little vitamin D (deficiency)\n\n【6】 #Diagnosis - Blood tests: Patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism may indicate signs, such as elevated levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH), a low serum calcium, and an abnormal serum phosphorus. Blood tests can also check renal functions of the patients.\n- Bone densitometry: The doctor may arrange a dual x-ray absorptiometry to determine bone density and to reveal bone loss, fractures, or bone softening.\n- Imaging tests: Imaging tests such as x-rays, ultrasound, CT or MRI scans of the kidneys and nuclear imaging may show signs of calcium deposits or a blockage, certain type of cancer.\n\n【7】 #When to seek urgent medical care?\nCall your health care provider if you have symptoms of secondary hyperparathyroidism , particularly if you are being treated for kidney disease. If you suffer either of the following symptoms, seeking urgent medical care as soon as possible:\n- Bone pain\n- Fractures\n\n【8】 #Treatment options\nCorrecting the calcium level and the underlying problem can bring the PTH levels back to normal.\nTreatment may involve:\n- A special form of vitamin D (requires a doctor's prescription) if you have low vitamin D levels\n- Surgery for cancer\nPatients with chronic kidney failure are usually given calcium and vitamin D, and are told to avoid phosphate in their diet. A medication called cinacalcet (Sensipar) may also be recommended. Dialysis, a kidney transplant, or parathyroid surgery may be needed.\n\n【9】 #Diseases with similar symptoms\n- Rickets\n- Gout\n- Ewing's Sarcoma - Chondroblastoma - Bone metastases\n\n【10】 #Where to find medical care for secondary hyperparathyroidism?\nDirections to Hospitals Treating secondary hyperparathyroidism\n\n【11】 #Prevention of secondary hyperparathyroidism\nEarly diagnosis and treatment of rickets or vitamin D deficiency may prevent this condition. Proper treatment of kidney failure helps reduce symptoms of secondary hyperparathyroidism.\n\n【12】 #What to expect (Outook/Prognosis)?\nThe prognosis of secondary hyperparathyroidism depends on the underlying cause.\n\n【13】 #Possible complications\nPersons with kidney problems may continue to produce too much parathyroid hormone even when their calcium level is back to normal. This is called \"tertiary hyperthyroidism.\" Parathyroid surgery may be needed.\nOther complications include:\n- Increased risk of broken bones\n- Renal osteodystrophy (a condition that causes bone pain, weakness, and fractures)", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Evidence on the efficacy is limited in quality and quantity, particularly in the long term. Therefore, this procedure should only be used with special arrangements for clinical governance, consent, and audit or research.\nClinicians wanting to do ab interno canaloplasty for open-angle glaucoma should:\nInform the clinical governance leads in their healthcare organisation.\nGive people (and their families and carers, as appropriate) clear information to support shared decision making, including NICE's information for the public.\nEnsure that people (and their families and carers, as appropriate) understand the procedure's safety and efficacy, and any uncertainties about these.\nAudit and review clinical outcomes of everyone having the procedure. The main efficacy and safety outcomes identified in this guidance can be entered into NICE's interventional procedure outcomes audit tool (for use at local discretion).\n\n【3】 Discuss the outcomes of the procedure during their annual appraisal to reflect, learn and improve.\nHealthcare organisations should:\nRegularly review data on outcomes and safety for this procedure.\nPatient selection and treatment should be done by glaucoma specialists with training and experience in the technique.\nReport any problems with a medical device using the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency's Yellow Card Scheme.\nFurther research should report:\n\n【4】 #The condition\nGlaucoma is usually a chronic condition that is typically associated with raised intraocular pressure (IOP). The most common type of glaucoma in the UK is primary open-angle glaucoma. It leads to progressive damage to the optic nerve. Early stages are usually asymptomatic. But, as the condition progresses, it can cause visual impairment and, if untreated, blindness.\nIn the healthy eye, aqueous humor drains through the trabecular meshwork (into Schlemm's canal) and through the uveoscleral outflow pathway. In glaucoma, this drainage becomes impaired, either from resistance in the trabecular meshwork pathway (primary open-angle glaucoma) or from obstruction by the iris (primary closed-angle glaucoma).\n\n【5】 #Current treatments\nTreatment usually involves eye drops containing medicines that either reduce the production of aqueous humor or increase its drainage. Surgical procedures such as trabeculectomy, deep sclerectomy, trabeculotomy, stenting, canaloplasty or laser trabeculoplasty may be used.\n\n【6】 #The procedure\nAb interno canaloplasty aims to reduce IOP by improving the drainage of aqueous fluid from the eye in people with open-angle glaucoma. It is usually done under local anaesthesia, but general anaesthesia can be used. Unlike traditional (ab externo) canaloplasty, which is done by cutting through the conjunctiva and sclera, ab interno canaloplasty uses an internal approach through a clear corneal or limbal incision. A microcatheter is introduced into the canal through a small opening in the trabecular meshwork and advanced around its entire circumference. As the catheter tip is withdrawn, viscoelastic fluid is injected into the canal to dilate it. The microcatheter is then removed. The viscoelastic fluid disperses down the collector channels of the eye within 2 to 3 days. The aim is to permanently dilate the canal to allow increased drainage of aqueous humor from the eye and thereby lower IOP. Some devices allow canaloplasty to be done sequentially with trabeculotomy as part of a single operation. Canaloplasty is often done concurrently with phacoemulsification (cataract surgery).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

This Periodinane is especially suited to oxidize alcohols to aldehydes. The IBX acid is prepared from 2-iodobenzoic acid, potassium bromate and sulfuric acid.  Frigerio and co-workers have also demonstrated, in 1999 that potassium bromate may be replaced by commercially available Oxone.  One of the main drawbacks of IBX is its limited solubility; IBX is insoluble in many common organic solvents.  In the past, it was believed that IBX was shock sensitive, but it was later determined that samples of IBX were shock sensitive due to the residual potassium bromate left from its preparation.  Commercial IBX is stabilized by carboxylic acids such as benzoic acid and isophthalic acid.\n\n【1】 #Reaction mechanism\nThe reaction mechanism for an oxidation of an alcohol to an aldehyde according the so-called hypervalent twisting mechanism involves a ligand exchange reaction replacing the hydroxyl group by the alcohol followed by a twist and a elimination reaction. The twist is a requirement because the iodine to oxygen double bond is oriented out of plane with the alkoxy group and the concerted elimination would not be able to take place. This twist reaction is a rearrangement in which the oxygen atom is moved into a proper plane for a 5 membered cyclic transition state in the elimination reaction and is calculated by Computational chemistry to be the rate-determining step in the oxidation. The twist mechanism also explains why oxidation is faster for larger alcohols than for small alcohols. The twist is driven forward by the steric hindrance that exists between the ortho hydrogen atom and the protons from the alkoxy group and larger alkoxy groups create larger steric repulsion. The same computation predicts a much faster reacting IBX derivative with a 100 fold reaction rate when this ortho hydrogen atom is replaced by a methyl group thus facilitating the twist until the elimination reaction takes prevalence as the rate determining step.\nIBX exists as two tautomers one of which is the carboxylic acid. The acidity of IBX which has been determined in water (pKa 2.4) and DMSO (pKa 6.65) is known to affect organic reactions for instance acid-catalyzed isomerization accompanying oxidations.\n\n【2】 #Scope\nIBX is also available as silica gel or polystyrene bound IBX. In many application IBX acid is replaced by Dess-Martin periodinane which is more soluble in common organic solvents. A sample reaction is a IBX oxidation used in the total synthesis of eicosanoid:\nIn 2001, K.C. Nicolaou and co-workers published a series of papers in the Journal of the American Chemical Society demonstrating, among other transformations, the use of IBX to oxidize benzylic carbons to conjugated aromatic carbonyl compounds.\n\n【3】 ## Oxidative cleavage\nThe use of IBX in combination with dimethyl sulfoxide was demonstrated in oxidative cleavage of vicinal diols to ketones:\nThe reaction mechanism for this glycol cleavage is based on initial formation of an adduct between 10-I-4 IBX and DMSO to an 12-I-5 intermediate 3 in which DMSO acts as a leaving group for incoming alcohol 4 to intermediate 5. One equivalent of water is split off forming 12-I-5 spirobicyclic periodinane 6 setting the stage for fragmentation to 7. With hydroxyl alpha protons presents oxidation to the acyloin competes. Trifluoroacetic acid is found to facilitate the overall reaction.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Thus, ampicillin class antibiotics should not be administered to patients with mononucleosis. In patients treated with ampicillin/sulbactam the possibility of superinfections with mycotic or bacterial pathogens should be kept in mind during therapy. If superinfections occur (usually involving Pseudomonas or Candida), the drug should be discontinued and/or appropriate therapy instituted. Prescribing ampicillin/sulbactam in the absence of proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.\nPatients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including ampicillin/sulbactam should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g. the common cold). When ampicillin/sulbactam is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may  decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and  increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by ampicillin/sulbactam or other antibacterial drugs in the future.Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.\nProbenecid decreases the renal tubular secretion of ampicillin and sulbactam. Concurrent use of probenecid with ampicillin/sulbactam may result in increased and prolonged blood levels of ampicillin and sulbactam. The concurrent administration of allopurinol and ampicillin increases substantially the incidence of rashes in patients receiving both drugs as compared to patients receiving ampicillin alone. It is not known whether this potentiation of ampicillin rashes is due to allopurinol or the hyperuricemia present in these patients. There are no data with ampicillin/sulbactam and allopurinol administered concurrently. Ampicillin/sulbactam and aminoglycosides should not be reconstituted together due to the in vitro inactivation of aminoglycosides by the ampicillin component of ampicillin/sulbactam.\nLong-term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic or mutagenic potential.\nReproduction studies have been performed in mice, rats, and rabbits at doses up to 10 times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to ampicillin/sulbactam. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.\nStudies in guinea pigs have shown that intravenous administration of ampicillin decreased the uterine tone, frequency of contractions, height of contractions, and duration of contractions. However, it is not known whether the use of ampicillin/sulbactam in humans during labor or delivery has immediate or delayed adverse effects on the fetus, prolongs the duration of labor, or increases the likelihood that forceps delivery or other obstetrical intervention or resuscitation of the newborn will be necessary.\nLow concentrations of ampicillin and sulbactam are excreted in the milk; therefore, caution should be exercised when ampicillin/sulbactam is administered to a nursing woman.\nThe safety and effectiveness of ampicillin/sulbactam have been established for pediatric patients one year of age and older for skin and skin structure infections as approved in adults. Use of ampicillin/sulbactam in pediatric patients is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with additional data from pediatric pharmacokinetic studies, a controlled clinical trial conducted in pediatric patients and post-marketing adverse events surveillance.

There were not enough data available for this guideline to determine whether prasugrel is less effective, or even harmful, in people aged 75 and over. Further research is needed to determine the optimal dual antiplatelet therapy for this group of older people.\n\n【56】 ## Primary PCI and fibrinolysis in people with acute STEMI who have a long anticipated transfer time for primary PCI\nIn people with acute STEMI who present more than 1 hour after the onset of symptoms, is a primary PCI-related delay of 120 to 180 minutes associated with outcomes similar to, better or worse than pre-hospital administered fibrinolysis?\nPrimary PCI is the preferred coronary reperfusion therapy provided it can be delivered 'in a timely fashion'. It is suggested that primary PCI is the preferred reperfusion strategy for primary PCI-related delays of at least up to 2 hours. However, there is inadequate evidence to conclude whether primary PCI is still preferable at primary PCI-related time delays of more than 2 hours.\nNo specifically designed randomised controlled trial (RCT) or observational study has addressed the issue of the extent to which primary PCI-related time delay (and other factors such as presentation delay and a person's risk profile) diminishes the advantages of primary PCI over fibrinolysis. For example, in more geographically remote areas, a short presentation delay together with an anticipated long primary PCI-related delay could favour a strategy of pre-hospital fibrinolysis.\nTo answer this question, an RCT of pre-hospital fibrinolysis versus primary PCI in people with acute STEMI who have a primary PCI-related time delay of 2 hours or more is needed. Primary endpoints would include cardiovascular and all-cause mortality and other major adverse cardiovascular events.\n\n【57】 ## Ischaemia testing\nWhat is the role of ischaemia testing in people after an acute coronary syndrome and what is the comparative efficacy and cost effectiveness of the different non-invasive tests ?\nAn increasing number of non-invasive tests are now available for the investigation of suspected myocardial ischaemia. These tests need different equipment, different clinical expertise, come at different costs and may differ in their ability to detect and quantify myocardial ischaemia. Their place in the routine investigation of patients admitted with unstable angina and non-ST‑segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) (particularly those who have not undergone angiography), as opposed to their selective use, is not clear. Management of unstable angina and NSTEMI would be enhanced if the relative place of these investigations were better understood and an assessment of their cost effectiveness made.\n\n【58】 ## Relationship between volume of procedures and clinical outcomes\nWhat is the relationship between hospital volume of primary PCI procedures and optimal outcomes in people with acute STEMI?\nThere is a suggestion that outcomes may be better in larger-volume primary PCI units, and some retrospective registries have reported data to support this. However, the quality of the data is poor and still leaves the question open. In the UK, primary PCI is provided by units that vary greatly in the number of cases per year. The development of services has been ad hoc and not designed specifically around the provision of primary PCI. If it was possible to conclusively show that people were or were not better off having treatment in larger-volume units, then it would have important implications for the national provision of primary PCI.\n\n【59】 ## Risk assessment – risk scoring systems\nWhat is the clinical and cost effectiveness of the systematic use of risk scoring systems (in addition to clinical assessment) for ischaemic outcomes and bleeding complications in the management of unstable angina and NSTEMI (at all levels of risk) compared with clinical assessment alone?\nMost risk scoring systems currently predict the likelihood of mortality or ischaemic cardiovascular events at various times after a patient's admission to hospital with an acute coronary syndrome. A number of interventions (such as drugs and revascularisation procedures) have been shown to reduce these adverse outcomes. This effect tends to be greatest in patients at highest risk. However, as a broad generalisation, patients who are at highest ischaemic risk are also those who are at higher risk of bleeding complications associated with the use of multiple antiplatelet and antithrombin agents. There are fewer scoring systems that predict bleeding risk, but we know that bleeding complications are associated with a significantly worse outcome. Using a combination of scoring systems assessing ischaemic and bleeding risk when evaluating data from randomised trials and registries may help to determine where the net clinical benefit (reduction in ischaemic risk minus any increase in bleeding risk) lies.\n\n【60】 ## Risk assessment – data from cardiac registries\nFor patients with unstable angina and NSTEMI (at differing levels of risk), how do clinical outcome data (adverse cardiovascular events and bleeding complications) collected in cardiac registries compare with data derived from RCTs?\nPatients recruited to participate in clinical trials are often highly selected; trials tend not to include patients who are very elderly, are at high risk, or have significant comorbidity. On the other hand, good registry data include information on all patients, but are observational and not randomised. Often there is uncertainty about how the outcome data from RCTs can be applied to the much larger unselected population of patients admitted to UK hospitals with unstable angina or NSTEMI. A greater understanding of the differences between RCT and registry populations, and their levels of ischaemic and bleeding risk would help inform future management. Collection of well-validated registry data is essential if conclusions from RCTs are to be applied appropriately to all patients with unstable angina and NSTEMI, not just to patients who are comparable to trial populations.\n\n【61】 ## Management of hyperglycaemia\nWhat is the optimal management of hyperglycaemia in people with acute coronary syndrome who have diagnosed or previously undiagnosed diabetes?\nExisting studies on the optimal management of hyperglycaemia in people who have acute coronary syndrome and diagnosed or previously undiagnosed diabetes are generally of poor quality.\nIt is recommended that a large RCT is conducted for people with acute coronary syndrome and hyperglycaemia (blood glucose 11 mmol/litre and over) stratified by NSTEMI and STEMI and by known diabetes and without a previous diagnosis of diabetes.\nThe interventions for the trial should be intravenous insulin or subcutaneous insulin administered within 4 hours of presentation to hospital. The aim is to achieve blood glucose between 6 and 11 mmol/litre for at least 24 hours. The comparator should be standard care.\n\n【62】 ## Beta-blockers\nDoes continuing beta-blocker treatment beyond 1 year after a myocardial infarction (MI) improve outcomes for people with normal left ventricular systolic function?\nRecent cohort studies have suggested that continuing treatment with a beta-blocker beyond a year after an acute MI may not confer any benefit to the person in terms of reduced morbidity or mortality. This is particularly relevant given recent changes in acute management strategies. While beta-blockers are valuable in reducing mortality and morbidity for up to a year after an MI, they have side effects and represent an additional treatment burden to people who are already taking many other medications. However, there is also some suggestion that there are risks associated with withdrawal of beta-blockers in this population. The balance of risks and benefits of long-term beta blockade has not been clearly determined, particularly in the context of modern acute treatment of MI\n\n【63】 #Rationale and impact\nThese sections briefly explain why the committee made the recommendations and how they might affect practice.\n\n【64】 #Dual antiplatelet therapy for acute STEMI intended for primary PCI\n\n【65】 ## Why the committee made the recommendation\nEvidence was reviewed comparing the clinical effectiveness of clopidogrel, prasugrel and ticagrelor, each in combination with aspirin, at time-points of 30 days and 1 year. Prasugrel and ticagrelor were more effective than clopidogrel at both time-points. In a network meta-analysis of the 30‑day data, prasugrel was more effective than ticagrelor, although with some uncertainty around this conclusion. Prasugrel was more effective than ticagrelor at 1 year with noteworthy differences in all-cause mortality and re‑infarction The results favouring prasugrel were driven by the ISAR‑REACT 5 trial that directly compared ticagrelor and prasugrel and these were considered the most relevant. The committee agreed that clinical evidence and cost-effectiveness results are directly applicable to the treatment of ST‑segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in the NHS, and recommended prasugrel for people with STEMI undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).\nThe final wording of the recommendation reflects the wording of the summary of product characteristics for prasugrel. If there is particular concern about bleeding risk from prasugrel in a person aged 75 or over, either ticagrelor or clopidogrel might be used instead; although ticagrelor is the more cost effective of the two, it also carries a higher bleeding risk.\nAn exception was added for people needing anticoagulation for a separate reason (for example, ongoing atrial fibrillation). For these people, clopidogrel is preferred because of the high bleeding risk of full anticoagulation plus prasugrel.\n\n【66】 ## How the recommendation might affect practice\nIn the UK, prasugrel is currently used less than ticagrelor or clopidogrel. The recommendation will therefore require a change in prescribing for most centres, but should be easily achievable. Prasugrel costs less than ticagrelor, but considerably more than clopidogrel, and although some areas will see a cost saving from switching to prasugrel from ticagrelor, the overall effect of this recommendation will be an increase in cost to the NHS.\n\n【67】 #Antithrombin therapy during primary PCI for acute STEMI\n1.13\n\n【68】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nWhen considering the evidence on the effectiveness of bivalirudin for people with acute STEMI undergoing primary PCI, the committee gave more weight to studies that were closest to current UK practice. These included studies that used bailout or selective, rather than routine, glycoprotein inhibitors (GPIs) and radial artery rather than femoral artery access. The committee concluded that there was no convincing difference between bivalirudin and the main alternative, heparin, in terms of mortality, and that bivalirudin is inferior to heparin in reducing the need for subsequent unplanned revascularisation. The committee discussed data on bleeding risk and agreed that there is no clinically significant difference between bivalirudin and heparin when radial access is used, but bivalirudin probably lowers the bleeding risk when access via the femoral artery is needed. The committee noted that heparin is cheaper than bivalirudin and easier to administer.\n\n【69】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\nThe committee agreed that the recommendations generally reflect current practice and are not expected to result in a substantial resource impact to the NHS in England.\n\n【70】 #Complete revascularisation with PCI or culprit vessel only PCI for acute STEMI\n1.17\n\n【71】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nEvidence showed that complete revascularisation with multivessel PCI reduced cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction (MI) and repeat revascularisation at 1 year, compared with culprit vessel only PCI for people with acute STEMI without cardiogenic shock. It was also associated with lower overall costs.\nAlthough the evidence clearly favoured complete revascularisation, there was less certainty about the timing of the non-culprit procedure. There are a number of different possible approaches to multivessel PCI: undertaking multivessel revascularisation at the time of primary PCI; treating the culprit vessel during the primary procedure and then bringing the person back to the catheter laboratory for revascularisation of other vessels later in the index admission; or treating the culprit vessel during primary PCI, discharging the person and then electively readmitting them for further revascularisation. The committee agreed that multivessel PCI during the index admission should be considered, either at the time of primary PCI or later during the same admission. They were concerned that the clinical benefits may be lower and costs may be higher when people are discharged and readmitted, and noted that delaying treatment of the non-culprit lesions is worrying for patients. However, they agreed that the optimal timing within the index admission will depend on a number of variables and is best left to the discretion of the clinical team.\nPeople with cardiogenic shock were excluded from these studies of multivessel PCI and the committee agreed that, in view of the results from the separate CULPRIT-SHOCK trial, it was not appropriate to recommend multivessel PCI for this group during the index admission.\n\n【72】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\nCurrent practice is variable across centres and also within centres. Some offer multivessel PCI during the first procedure for acute STEMI but others may postpone this (either to later within the index admission or to a later readmission). Some operate on the culprit vessel only. The recommendations are therefore likely to result in a change in practice, but not for all centres or all professionals performing PCI. Because the recommendations allow for multivessel PCI to be either at the time of primary PCI or later within the index admission, they offer flexibility to accommodate situations in which there are a number of other people waiting for primary PCI. Healthcare professionals can move on to treat the next person after completing revascularisation of the culprit vessel, minimising the overall impact on primary PCI services.\nThere will be a resource impact for centres not currently undertaking multivessel PCI, because multivessel PCI has higher costs than culprit vessel only PCI. Audit data reported by MINAP (the Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project) between April 2016 and March 2017 show there were 33,797 cases of STEMI reported in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man. It is estimated that around 30% will present with multivessel disease, which would be around 10,000 people. However, it is unclear for how many of these people multivessel PCI would be suitable. The change from current practice is likely to be cost saving overall because of the reduction in later revascularisation procedures.\n\n【73】 #Drug-eluting stents\n2.18\n\n【74】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nEvidence from angiography studies showed that drug-eluting stents are less likely to fail than bare metal stents in terms of both recurrence of obstruction to the target vessel and the need for further revascularisation. The evidence also shows that drug-eluting stents may be beneficial in reducing deaths (all-cause and cardiac) and there is a reduced incidence of MI in the 3 years after revascularisation when drug-eluting stents are used. Costs of drug-eluting stents are higher than bare metal stents, but analyses using current cost and benefit data suggest that they are a cost-effective use of resources.\n\n【75】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\nThe use of drug-eluting stents has been slowly increasing over recent years in the UK and the most recent national audit data show that 91% of PCIs for acute coronary syndromes used stents and 97% of these used drug-eluting stents. The recommendation will therefore involve little change from current practice and will not have a substantial resource impact for the NHS in England.\n\n【76】 #Antiplatelet therapy for STEMI not treated with PCI\n1.25\n\n【77】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThe UK licence for prasugrel is for people with acute coronary syndrome who are proceeding to coronary angiography with a view to PCI. Although this is usual practice for most people with STEMI, for some people, either medical management without coronary revascularisation or coronary artery surgery are better options. Direct evidence in these patient groups was lacking; the evidence comparing the clinical effectiveness of clopidogrel and ticagrelor was largely for people receiving PCI. This showed convincing superiority of ticagrelor in reducing mortality (cardiac and all-cause) and in preventing re‑infarction and the need for future revascularisation procedures, although there was some evidence of an increased risk of bleeding complications. The committee agreed to recommend ticagrelor for people with STEMI having medical management unless they are at high risk of bleeding when clopidogrel or no second antiplatelet may be the safer option. However, the committee were aware that some of the excess bleeding risk comes from complications of a PCI procedure, which is not relevant to this particular group of people with acute coronary syndrome. They therefore made a recommendation to offer ticagrelor in most cases but to consider clopidogrel as an alternative when the bleeding risk is high.\n\n【78】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\nIn the UK, both ticagrelor and clopidogrel are currently used for STEMI that is managed without PCI. The recommendations require a change in practice for most, but not all, people who would otherwise receive clopidogrel. Ticagrelor costs considerably more than clopidogrel, and although the recommendations apply to a minority of people with STEMI, the effect will be an increase in cost to the NHS.\n\n【79】 #Initial antithrombin therapy for unstable angina and NSTEMI\n2.16\n\n【80】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThe 2010 NICE guideline on unstable angina and NSTEMI recommended fondaparinux rather than low molecular weight heparin for initial management. The recommendation was based mainly on evidence from a single large study (the OASIS‑5 study). This study showed a small risk of catheter thrombosis when fondaparinux was the only antithrombin used before angiography, and therefore the 2010 guideline recommended not to use fondaparinux when angiography is planned within 24 hours. The thrombosis risk was noted by the OASIS‑5 investigators before the study ended, and in the later phase of the study, people were given intravenous unfractionated heparin with fondaparinux during angiography; this appeared to remove the excess risk of catheter thrombosis. Two further small studies published after 2010 have confirmed that giving unfractionated heparin during angiography to people already receiving fondaparinux removed the excess risk of catheter thrombosis. The committee considered that unfractionated heparin is already used in this way in many centres, agreed with the 2010 guideline that fondaparinux is the most cost-effective option, and were able to remove the caveat about avoiding fondaparinux if catheterisation is planned within 24 hours. They recommended that fondaparinux should be given to people who are not at high risk of bleeding unless they are having immediate angiography. People receiving fondaparinux should be given additional systemic unfractionated heparin in the catheter laboratory.\n\n【81】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\nFondaparinux is already used before angiography in many centres in the UK, with additional unfractionated heparin given during the procedure. The recommendations will affect those centres currently withholding fondaparinux from people having angiography in the next 24 hours. Fondaparinux is a cheaper option than low molecular weight heparin so the recommendation could be cost saving in these centres.\n\n【82】 #Early invasive versus conservative management for unstable angina and NSTEMI\n2.19\n\n【83】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThe 2010 guideline on unstable angina and non-ST-segment elevation MI (NSTEMI) recommended a comprehensive assessment of baseline risk of adverse events. The committee agreed that this should influence the choice between early invasive intervention (coronary angiography, with PCI if indicated) and conservative management (initial medical management, proceeding to coronary angiography and PCI if there is evidence of recurrent ischaemia). Studies comparing these options show a short-term harm with an invasive strategy, but this is offset by the clinical benefits in the months following the procedure. A cost-effectiveness analysis found that routine early invasive intervention was cost effective in people at higher risk of adverse events, but conservative management was the most cost-effective option for people at lower risk. This was because overall health gains were greater in those at higher baseline risk.\nMost of the evidence was already available at the time of the 2010 guideline, and the committee recognised that the data may be less applicable to modern practice than had been the case in 2010. Nonetheless, they agreed that early angiography should be the default recommendation for most people at intermediate or higher baseline risk of adverse outcomes However, the committee also recognised that the risk prediction models might be less applicable to the youngest people with unstable angina and NSTEMI who are relatively under-represented in the dataset, and therefore added a cautionary recommendation to this effect.\n\n【84】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\nThe recommendations largely reflect current NHS practice. Although the timeframe for early invasive management has been reduced from 96 hours, 72 hours has been specified in the NICE quality standard for a number of years and a best practice tariff on the same basis was introduced in 2017. Audit data are only currently available from the same year as the introduction of the tariff and report that, of people who are admitted to a hospital that can perform angiography, 56% received angiography within 72 hours and 69% within 96 hours. The proportion receiving angiography within 72 hours is likely to be higher since the introduction of the best practice tariff. Performing angiography earlier is likely to result in a shorter hospital stay. The recommendations are unlikely to result in a substantial resource impact for the NHS.\n\n【85】 #Antiplatelet therapy for unstable angina and NSTEMI\n2.17, 1.2.20 and 1.2.21\n\n【86】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThe committee agreed that dual antiplatelet therapy should not be offered to people with chest pain before a diagnosis of unstable angina or NSTEMI is made. In their experience, dual antiplatelet therapy had caused harm (bleeding) in some people presenting with chest pain not caused by an acute coronary syndrome.\nEvidence was reviewed comparing the clinical effectiveness of clopidogrel, prasugrel and ticagrelor, each in combination with aspirin, at time-points of 30 days and 1 year Although the overall conclusion was that prasugrel is a more effective agent than ticagrelor, which in turn is more effective than clopidogrel, there was considerable uncertainty around the cost-effectiveness results, with either prasugrel or ticagrelor being most cost effective in different scenarios using different clinical data. The results favouring prasugrel were driven by the ISAR‑REACT 5 trial, in which time to angiography was much shorter than is currently achieved in the UK for people with unstable angina or NSTEMI. This could cause practical difficulty in using prasugrel because its licence effectively prevents its use before angiography, and this could leave people with unstable angina or NSTEMI without dual antiplatelet therapy for several days. The committee therefore recommended either prasugrel or ticagrelor for people with unstable angina or NSTEMI intended for PCI, depending on individual circumstances. The final wording of the recommendation reflects the wording of the summary of product characteristics for prasugrel.\nAlthough many people with unstable angina or NSTEMI proceed to PCI, for some medical management without coronary revascularisation or coronary artery surgery are better options. Prasugrel is not licensed in these circumstances. The evidence available for medical management shows better outcomes with ticagrelor than clopidogrel. This is consistent with results from the larger datasets for people having PCI. The committee therefore recommended ticagrelor for people with unstable angina or NSTEMI having either medical management without coronary revascularisation or coronary artery surgery. However, the committee also noted that clopidogrel may be the safer agent for people who are at high risk of bleeding but still need dual antiplatelet therapy, although this is based on evidence of higher bleeding risk with ticagrelor in people with an acute coronary syndrome generally rather than specific evidence from those at higher risk. They therefore made a recommendation to consider using clopidogrel in this situation.\n\n【87】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\nIn the UK, prasugrel is currently used less than ticagrelor or clopidogrel. The recommendations may therefore involve a change in practice for some centres. Prasugrel costs less than ticagrelor, but considerably more than clopidogrel, and although some areas will see a cost saving from switching to prasugrel from ticagrelor, others will see an increase where either prasugrel or ticagrelor is used instead of clopidogrel. The overall effect of these recommendations will be an increase in cost to the NHS.\n\n【88】 #Antiplatelet therapy for people with an indication for anticoagulation\n\n【89】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThe committee noted that current practice is to use dual antiplatelet therapy at the time of PCI, and found no evidence to recommend changing this practice for people who are on an anticoagulant at the time of admission. In practice, the anticoagulant will often be suspended for a short period (perhaps using heparin cover). The evidence available showed that continuing dual antiplatelet therapy plus an anticoagulant after the acute PCI phase increases the risk of bleeding complications, and so a recommendation raising awareness of this issue was included. The committee therefore agreed that either aspirin or the second antiplatelet agent should be stopped, but unfortunately there was no evidence to show at what point this should happen.\nIn the absence of any conclusive data, recommendations for treatment after the initial phase were based on the knowledge and experience of the committee. For people who have had PCI and stent insertion, they agreed that it would be safest to combine an anticoagulant with a potent antiplatelet agent (clopidogrel), whereas for those who have had medical management or had angioplasty without stenting, the anticoagulant should be combined with aspirin. There was not enough evidence for the committee to recommend a particular anticoagulant.\n\n【90】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\nCurrent practice is variable, with people taking different combinations of antiplatelets and anticoagulants. The number of people affected is small. It is estimated that between 5% and 15% of people with an acute coronary syndrome will have an indication for oral anticoagulation. The recommendations are mostly unchanged from the 2013 guideline and the minor changes that have been made are unlikely to result in a substantial resource impact for the NHS in England.\n\n【91】 #Duration of beta-blocker treatment after an MI\n4.27\n\n【92】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThere was no direct evidence on the optimal duration of beta-blocker treatment for people who have had an MI but do not have reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. The 2013 guideline recommended beta-blocker treatment for at least 12 months. In the absence of any conclusive evidence, the committee agreed that they could not recommend a definite time for stopping treatment. However, they agreed that healthcare professionals should discuss the absence of clear evidence for benefit of continuing beyond 12 months with people taking beta-blockers after an MI who have normal left ventricular function. This should prompt a personalised approach to stopping or continuing beta-blockers based on the person's attitude to risk and experience of side effects.\n\n【93】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\nBeta-blockers are currently offered for at least 12 months after an MI to people without reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. Audit data show that around 97% of people with MI are discharged on beta-blockers. A discussion of the absence of clear evidence for benefit of continuing treatment beyond 12 months is likely to lead to more people deciding to stop treatment at this point. Any reduction in prescriptions for beta-blockers will be cost saving.\n\n【94】 Acute coronary syndromes due to ischaemic heart disease remain a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. In 2015, heart disease remained the leading cause of death in men and the second most common cause of death in women in England. In 2015/16, more than 58,000 people were admitted to hospital in England with a heart attack. Although many more people now survive than in the past, there remains considerable scope to reduce their future risk of death, angina, heart failure and further heart attack.\nNational audits continue to show variation in practice across the UK in the treatments offered for acute coronary syndromes. This, combined with evidence of novel ways of treating acute coronary syndromes and updates to existing treatments, indicates a need for an updated guideline that will help deliver best practice to the large number of people receiving treatment for acute coronary syndromes in the NHS.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

It is a common condition in humans particularly in the tropics and the agrarian societies. In developing countries, as well as in Florida, corneal ulcer is frequently the cause of great morbidity as well as economic loss to the person and family. Children afflicted by Vitamin A deficiency are at high risk for corneal ulcer and may become blind in both eyes, which may persist lifelong, causing tremendous & avoidable loss to the person and the society.\n\n【2】 #Causes\nCorneal ulcers are a common human eye disease. They are caused by trauma, particularly with vegetable matter, chemical injury, contact lenses, and infections. Other eye conditions can cause corneal ulcers, such as entropion, distichiae, corneal dystrophy, and keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eye).\n\n【3】 #Risk Factors\nPeople with poor eye hygiene and contact lens abusers (e.g. those who wear contact lenses overnight) are at an increased risk of developing corneal ulcers. Corneal ulcers are a common condition in humans, particularly those living in the tropics and in agrarian societies. In developing countries, children afflicted by vitamin A deficiency are at a high risk for corneal ulcer and may become blind in both eyes, which may persist lifelong if not treated.\n\n【4】 ## History and Symptoms\nCorneal ulcers are painful due to nerve exposure, and can cause tearing, squinting, and vision loss of the eye.  There may also be signs of anterior uveitis, such as miosis (small pupil), aqueous flare (protein in the aqueous humour), and redness of the eye.  An axon reflex may be responsible for uveitis formation — stimulation of pain receptors in the cornea results in release inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandins, histamine, and acetylcholine.\n\n【5】 ## Laboratory Findings\nDiagnosis is done by direct observation under magnified view of slit lamp revealing the ulcer on the cornea Herpes simplex ulcers show a typical dendritic pattern of staining. Rose-Bengal dye is also used for supra-vital staining purposes, but it may be very irritating to the eyes. In descemetoceles, the Descemet's membrane will bulge forward and after staining will appear as a dark circle with a green boundary, because it does not absorb the stain. Doing a corneal scraping and examining under the microscope with stains like Gram's and KOH preparation may reveal the bacteria and fungi respectively. Microbiological culture tests may be necessary to isolate the causative organisms for some cases. Other tests that may be necessary include a Schirmer's test for keratoconjunctivitis sicca and an analysis of facial nerve function for facial nerve paralysis.\n\n【6】 ## Surgery\nSurgery in the form of corneal transplantation may be needed in few cases to save the eye.\n\n【7】 ## Primary Prevention\nContact lens wearers must be sure to wash their hands and pay very close attention to cleanliness while handling their lenses to prevent corneal ulcers. Also, contact lenses should not be worn overnight or when swimming, and eye lubricants should be used prior to lens removal to avoid scratches due to dryness. Prompt, early attention by an ophthalmologist or optometrist for an eye infection may prevent ulcers from forming.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "8427a801-3b17-41da-b908-4db9a4284f12", "title": null, "text": "【0】 Ménière's disease\n\n【1】 #Overview\nMénière's disease is a disorder affecting the sensory organ within the  inner ear responsible for balance and hearing. It is characterized by episodes of dizziness, tinnitus and progressive hearing loss, usually in one ear. This disturbance in the normal physiological functioning of the inner ear can be attributed to an increase in volume and pressure in the endolymph of the inner ear. The term \"Ménière's\" takes it origin after the French physician Prosper Ménière, who first reported that vertigo was caused by disorders of the inner ear in an article published in 1861.\n\n【2】 #Historical Background\nMénière's disease had been recognized prior to 1972 but the information available on its prevalence and understanding remained rather vague. Committees at the Academy of Ophthalmology and Otolaryngology made set criteria for diagnosing Ménière's, as well as defining two sub categories of Ménière's: cochlear (without vertigo) and vestibular (without deafness).\nIn 1972, the academy defined criteria for diagnosing Ménière's disease as:\n- Fluctuating, progressive, sensorineural deafness.\n- Episodic, characteristic definitive spells of vertigo lasting 20 minutes to 24 hours without loss of consciousness and associated with the presence of vestibular nystagmus .\n- Usually tinnitus.\n- Attacks are characterized by periods of remission and exacerbation.\nIn 1985, this list changed to alter wording, such as \"deafness\" changed to \"hearing loss associated with tinnitus, characteristic of low frequencies\" and requiring more than one attack of vertigo to diagnose.  Finally in 1995, the list was again altered to allow for its documentation based on various degrees of probability of having the disease:\n- Certain - Definite disease with histopathological confirmation\n- Definite - Requires two or more definitive episodes of vertigo with hearing loss plus tinnitus and/or aural fullness\n- Probable - Only one definitive episode of vertigo and the other symptoms and signs\n\n【3】 #Cause\n- Physiological -The exact cause of Ménière's disease is not known, but it is believed to be related to endolymphatic hydrops or excessive fluid in the inner ear. Several theories describing the causative mechanism have been proposed and documented, One such theory includes the decreased absorption or the increased production of the endolymph within the endolymphatic sac. This in-turn contributes to the swelling of the endolymphatic sac or other tissues in the vestibular system of the inner ear, a system responsible for the body's sense of balance which is disrupted a s a result of this pathology.\n- Anatomical - Longitudinal blockage in the structures responsible for the drainage of the endolymph causing an increase in the hydrostatic pressure within the endolymphatic sac was another theory that was proposed to describe the possible structural cause behind the disease.\n- Head trauma - Infectious - It has also been proposed that Ménière's symptoms could be the result of damage caused by a the large family of DNA virus, herpesviridae. Herpesviridae is prevalent in the dormant state in a majority of the population. It is suggested that the virus is reactivated when the immune system is depressed due to stressors such as trauma, infection or surgery (under general anaesthesia). Morphological changes to the inner ear of Ménière's sufferers has  been found and is likely considered to have resulted from attack by the herpes simplex virus. Symptoms then develop as the virus degrades the structure of the inner ear. Another consideration of  utmost importance is that the different strains of herpes virus have different characteristics and in-turn different pathophysiological effects on the inner ear sensory organ system.\n- Middle ear and Upper Respiratory Tract Infections.\n- Medications - Aspirin use\n- Substance use - Tobacco and alcohol use\n- Electrolyte imbalance - Excessive levels of potassium in the body (usually caused by the consumption of potassium rich foods)can also exacerbate these symptoms.\n\n【4】 #Symptoms\nThe symptoms of Ménière's are variable; not all sufferers experience the same symptoms.  However, so-called \"classic Ménière's\" is considered to comprise of  the following four symptoms:\n- Periodic episodes of rotary vertigo (the abnormal sensation of movement) or dizziness.\n- Fluctuating, progressive, unilateral (in one ear) or bilateral (in both ears) hearing loss, sensorineural in origin and often initially in the low frequency ranges.\n- Unilateral or bilateral tinnitus (the perception of noises, often ringing, roaring, or whooshing), sometimes variable.\n- A sensation of fullness or pressure in one or both ears.\n- Ménière's often begins with one symptom, and gradually progresses.  A diagnosis may be made in the absence of all four classic symptoms. However, having several symptoms at once is more conclusive than having every individual symptom associated with the disease at a separate time.\n- Attacks of vertigo can be severe, incapacitating, and unpredictable. In some patients, attacks of vertigo can last for hours or days, and may be accompanied by an increase in the loudness of tinnitus and temporary, albeit significant, hearing loss in the affected ear(s).  Hearing may improve after an attack, but often becomes progressively worse. Vertigo attacks are sometimes accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and sweating.\n- Some sufferers experience what are informally known as \"drop attacks\"— sudden, severe attacks of dizziness or vertigo that causes the sufferers, if not seated, to fall. Patients may also experience the feeling of being pushed or pulled (Pulsion). Some patients may find it impossible to get up for some time, until the attack passes or medication takes its effect.  There is also the associated risk of injury with falls\n- Other symptoms include the  so-called \"brain fog\" (temporary short term loss of memory, forgetfulness, and confusion), exhaustion and drowsiness, headaches, vision problems, and depression, the  latter symptoms are commonly associated with other chronic conditions\n- Women may experience an increase in the frequency of episodes during pregnancy and menstruation, the most likely reasoning behind this exacerbation is the increased fluid retention seen with these conditions.\n\n【5】 #Differential Diagnosis\nABBREVIATIONS\nVZV= Varicella zoster virus, MRI= Magnetic resonance imaging, ESR= Erythrocyte sedimentation rate, EEG= Electroencephalogram, CSF= Cerebrospinal fluid, GPe= Globus pallidus externa, ICHD=  International Classification of Headache Disorders\n\n【6】 #Diagnosis\nMany disorders have symptoms similar to Ménière's.  The diagnosis is usually established by clinical findings and medical history  Because there is no definitive test for Ménière's, it is only diagnosed when all other causes have been ruled out.\nMénière’s disease typically starts between the ages of 20 and 50 years. Men and women are affected in equal numbers.- American Academy of Otolaryngology−Head and Neck Surgery\nMénière's typically begins between the ages of 30 and 60 years and affects men slightly more than women.\n\n【7】 ## Medical Treatment\nInitial treatment is targeted at relieving immediate symptoms and preventing recurrence of symptoms in the future and thus varies from patient to patient. Doctors may recommend vestibular training, methods for dealing with tinnitus, stress reduction, hearing aids to deal with hearing loss, and medication to alleviate nausea and symptoms of vertigo\n- Several environmental and dietary changes are thought to reduce the frequency or severity of symptom outbreaks.  Most patients are advised to adopt a low-sodium diet, typically one to two grams (1000-2000mg) at first, but diets as low as 400mg are not uncommon.  Patients are advised to avoid caffeine, alcohol and tobacco, all of which can aggravate symptoms of Ménière's.  Some clinicians recommend avoiding Aspartame.\n- Very often patients are prescribed a mild diuretic to decrease the inner ear fluid build up.\n- Some patients also undergo allergen testing during initial evaluation as allergies have been shown to aggravate Ménière's symptoms.\n- Lipoflavonoid, a natural bioflavonoid that contains some of the B vitamins namely B3, B6 and B12 of the B vitamin complex is recommended for treatment of the tinnitus component of the disease by some physicians.\n- Many patients consider fluorescent light as a trigger for their symptoms. The plausibility of this can be explained by the vital role that vision plays in the overall mechanism of human balance. Avoidance of such triggers can be one such way to prevent these symptoms.\n- The anti herpesvirus drug Acyclovir has also been used with some success to treat Ménière's Disease.The likelihood of the effectiveness of the treatment was found to decrease with increasing duration of the disease possibly because of the overtime accumulation of viral damage to the inner ear and thus demonstrated that suppression of the virus made no significant difference to the symptoms if the exposure was present for prolonged periods. It was considered possible that long term treatment with an acyclovir (greater than six months) would be required to produce a remarkable reduction in symptomatology. Herpes viruses have the ability to remain dormant in nerve cells by a process known as HHV Latency Associated Transcript. Continued administration of the drug  could  prevent reactivation of the virus and allow for the possibility of an improvement in symptoms.\n- Treatments aimed at lowering the pressure within the inner ear include antihistamines, anticholinergics, steroids, and diuretics. A medical device that provides transtympanic micropressure pulses is now showing some promising results and is becoming more widely used as a treatment for Ménière's\n\n【8】 ## Surgery\n- Surgery may be recommended if medical management does not control vertigo.\n- Injection of steroid medication behind the eardrum, or surgery to decompress the endolymphatic sac may be used for symptom relief.  Permanent surgical destruction of the balance part of the affected ear can be performed for severe or refractory cases if only one ear is affected. This can be achieved through chemical labyrinthectomy, in which a drug (such as gentamicin) that \"kills\" the vestibular apparatus is injected into the middle ear. The nerve responsible for the balance component of the inner ear can be cut (vestibular neurectomy), or the inner ear itself can be surgically removed (labyrinthectomy).\n- These treatments eliminate vertigo, but since they are typically destructive they are implemented only as a last resort. Usually balance returns to normal after these procedures, but hearing loss may continue to progress.\n\n【9】 #Progression/Prognosis\nProgression of Ménière's is unpredictable: symptoms may worsen, undergo complete resolution or remain the same.\nPatients with classical one or two symptoms may develop other symptoms over time.  Attacks of vertigo can progressively worsen and increase in frequency over time, resulting in unemployment and the inability to drive and travel.  Some patients become largely housebound.  Hearing loss can become profound and more permanent.  Some patients may also develop deafness in the affected ear. It is estimated that in fifty percent of the cases patients with unilateral symptoms will develop symptoms bilaterally. Tinnitus is also known to worsen over time. Some patients reported that after 8-10 years the vertigo attacks gradually became less frequent in severity; some patients reported that the symptoms disappeared completely. In some patients, symptoms of tinnitus disappear overtime and the hearing partially stabilises although typically with some permanent loss.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Both trials enrolled adults with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease (Crohn's Disease Activity Index  score 220–450) that had shown inadequate response to, loss of response to, or intolerance to at least 1 of the following: immunomodulators, TNF‑alpha inhibitors or corticosteroids (outside the USA only) within the last 5 years. Therapeutic doses of oral 5‑aminosalicylates, oral corticosteroids, probiotics, anti‑diarrhoeals, azathioprine or mercaptopurine, methotrexate and antibiotics were permitted. However, treatment with adalimumab within 30 days and with infliximab or certolizumab pegol within 60 days before enrolment was not permitted.\n\n【7】 ## GEMINI II study design\nGEMINI II compared the efficacy and safety of vedolizumab with placebo plus conventional therapy (oral prednisone or budesonide, immunosuppressive agents, mesalazine and antibiotics were permitted) for moderately to severely active Crohn's disease. It comprised an induction trial (weeks 0–6) and a maintenance trial (weeks 6–52), giving an overall study duration of 52 weeks.\nIn the blinded induction trial (cohort 1), patients received vedolizumab 300 mg intravenously (n=220) or placebo (n=148) at weeks 0 and 2. Randomisation was stratified by concomitant use of corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents or previous use of TNF‑alpha inhibitors, or both. The proportion of patients with previous exposure to TNF‑alpha inhibitors was limited to 50% (50.5% and 48.6% in the vedolizumab and placebo arms respectively). To fulfil sample‑size requirements for the maintenance trial, 748 additional patients were assigned treatment in an open‑label group (cohort 2), of whom 747 patients received the same vedolizumab regimen as that in cohort 1 in the blinded induction trial. Before the trial, 58% of all patients had experienced failure of a TNF‑alpha inhibitor.\nThe main analyses in the induction study of GEMINI II used the intention‑to‑treat population, which included all patients in cohort 1 who were randomised and received at least 1 dose of blinded study drug (n=148 in the placebo arm and n=220 in the vedolizumab arm). The maintenance study analyses also used the intention‑to‑treat population, which included patients who received vedolizumab whose disease had a clinical response at week 6 and who were then randomised to vedolizumab either every 4 or 8 weeks (n=154 each) or placebo (n=153). The non‑intention‑to‑treat population in the maintenance study was included in the safety assessment, comprising 814 patients who had vedolizumab and 301 patients who received placebo. In addition to patients in the intention‑to‑treat population, it included patients who received placebo in the induction phase and remained on placebo for the maintenance phase, and patients whose disease did not respond to vedolizumab by week 6 of the induction study. The company also presented subgroup analyses for patients in whom a TNF‑alpha inhibitor had failed (vedolizumab every 8 weeks , vedolizumab every 4 weeks  and placebo ) and for patients who had not had a TNF‑alpha inhibitor before (vedolizumab every 8 weeks , vedolizumab every 4 weeks  and placebo ).\n\n【8】 ## GEMINI III study design\nGEMINI III was a 10‑week study that evaluated the efficacy of vedolizumab compared with placebo. Patients were randomised to receive vedolizumab 300 mg (n=209) or placebo (n=207) at weeks 0, 2 and 6 and stratified according to whether they had previously had TNF‑alpha inhibitor treatment (there were 315 patients in whom a TNF‑alpha inhibitor had failed and 101 patients who had not had a TNF‑alpha inhibitor before). They were also stratified according to concomitant use of (a) oral corticosteroids and (b) concomitant use of immunomodulators (mercaptopurine, azathioprine, or methotrexate). At the end of the study, patients could enrol in GEMINI LTS. All randomised patients received at least 1 dose of blinded study drug and were included in the intention‑to‑treat population.\nThe primary analysis of GEMINI III focused on the 315 patients in whom a TNF‑alpha inhibitor had failed. The primary outcome was clinical remission at week 6 (CDAI score 150 points or less). A secondary analysis evaluated the overall population including patients who had not had TNF‑alpha inhibitor treatment before. Secondary outcomes included clinical remission at week 6 in the overall population, clinical remission at week 10 in the population in whom TNF‑alpha inhibitor treatment had failed and in the overall population, sustained clinical remission (CDAI score 150 points or less at both week 6 and week 10) in the population in whom TNF‑alpha inhibitor treatment had failed and in the overall population, and safety outcomes. Other outcomes included health‑related quality of life, as shown by change from baseline in IBDQ, SF‑36, and EQ‑5D scores at weeks 6 and 10.\n\n【9】 ## GEMINI II – induction phase results\nThe results for the primary outcomes of GEMINI II showed that at week 6, clinical remission rates (CDAI score 150 points or less) were significantly higher in patients having vedolizumab than in patients having placebo (14.5%  and 6.8%  respectively, p=0.02). There was no significant difference in enhanced clinical response (a 100‑point or greater decrease in the CDAI score) at week 6 between the vedolizumab and placebo groups (31.4%  compared with 25.7%  respectively; p=0.23).\nThe company carried out pre‑specified subgroup analyses for the primary outcomes, investigating the influence of baseline characteristics on treatment effect. For vedolizumab compared with placebo, the analyses showed a between‑treatment difference in clinical remission at week 6 of 8 In the new evidence provided in response to the appraisal consultation document, the company reported that clinical remission at week 6 in the population in whom a TNF‑alpha inhibitor had failed was experienced by 10.5% of patients receiving vedolizumab and 4.3% of patients receiving placebo (95% CI for between‑treatment difference −9.1 to 21.3). It further reported that an exploratory analysis in the same population showed that clinical remission at week 10 was experienced by 16.0% of patients in the vedolizumab group (n=5) and 8.6% of patients in the placebo group (n=70) (95% CI for between‑treatment difference 0.2 to 14.6).\n\n【10】 ## GEMINI II – maintenance phase results\nIn the intention‑to‑treat population in the maintenance study, there were statistically significantly higher rates of clinical remission (CDAI score 150 points or less) at week 52 in patients who received vedolizumab every 8 weeks or every 4 weeks, compared with patients who received placebo. In patients receiving vedolizumab every 8 weeks, the treatment difference from placebo was 17.4% (95% CI 7.3 to 27.5, p=0.0007) and in patients receiving vedolizumab every 4 weeks, it was 14.7% (95% CI 4.6 to 24.7, p=0.0042).\nClinical remission rates were higher for patients who had vedolizumab every 4 or 8 weeks compared with those who had placebo regardless of prior TNF‑alpha inhibitor use.\nThe company presented results for the changes in health‑related quality of life from baseline to week 52 in the groups having vedolizumab every 8 weeks (n=79), vedolizumab every 4 weeks (n=92) and placebo (n=81) in the overall population. Adjusted mean change in EQ‑5D score from baseline was −1.5 (95% CI −1.8 to −1.2) in patients having vedolizumab every 8 weeks, −1.4 (95% CI −1.7 to −1.1) in patients having vedolizumab every 4 weeks and −1.0 (95% CI −1.3 to −0.7) in patients having placebo. The mean difference in adjusted change from baseline compared with placebo was –0.5 (95% CI −0.9 to −0.1) for vedolizumab every 8 weeks and –0.4 (95% CI −0.8 to 0.0) for vedolizumab every 4 weeks. The company did not provide results for the changes in health‑related quality of life from baseline to week 52 for the sub‑populations who had not had a TNF‑alpha inhibitor before or in whom a TNF‑alpha inhibitor had failed.\n\n【11】 ## GEMINI III\nFor the primary outcome of clinical remission at week 6 in people for whom TNF‑alpha inhibitor treatment had failed, no statistically significant difference was seen between the vedolizumab (15.2% ) and placebo (12.1% ) groups (p=0.433). However, an exploratory analysis found a higher proportion of these patients had clinical remission at week 10 with vedolizumab than with placebo (26.6% ) compared with 12.1%  p=0.0012 .\nAn exploratory analysis of the overall population including patients who had not had a TNF‑alpha inhibitor before showed that clinical remission occurred in a higher proportion of patients having vedolizumab than placebo at week 6 (19.1%  compared with 12.1% , p=0.0478 ) and week 10 (28.7%  compared with 13.0% , p<0.0001 ).\nThe company provided results for changes in health‑related quality of life from baseline to weeks 6 and 10 for patients in the population in whom a TNF‑alpha inhibitor had failed. At week 6, adjusted mean change in EQ‑5D score was −0.4 (95% CI −0.6 to −0.2) in patients who had vedolizumab (n=158) and −0.1 (95% CI −0.3 to 0.1) in patients who had placebo (n=149), giving a mean difference in adjusted change from baseline of −0.2 (95% CI −0.5 to 0.1). At week 10, adjusted mean change in EQ‑5D score was −0.6 (95% CI −0.8 to −0.4) in patients who had vedolizumab (n=152) and −0.1 (95% CI −0.4 to 0.1) in patients who had placebo (n=143), giving a mean difference in adjusted change from baseline of −0.5 (95% CI −0.8 to −0.2). Similar results were seen in the overall study population.\n\n【12】 ## Pooled analysis of GEMINI II and III\nIn the new evidence submitted in response to the appraisal consultation document, the company described a post‑hoc analysis of pooled data from GEMINI II and III in the population in whom a TNF‑alpha inhibitor had failed. At 6 weeks there was no statistically significant difference between the vedolizumab group (n=263) and placebo group (n=227) in the proportion of patients in clinical remission (13.3% compared with 9.7% respectively, p=0.157). However, at 10 weeks the proportion of patients in clinical remission was statistically significantly higher with vedolizumab than with placebo (21.7% compared with 11.0%, p=0.0008).\n\n【13】 #Adverse effects of treatment\nIn the 52‑week GEMINI II study, 706 patients (87%) taking vedolizumab and 246 patients (82%) taking placebo had an adverse event. A higher proportion of patients had a serious adverse event in the vedolizumab group compared with the placebo group (24.4% and 15.3% respectively). Serious infection affected 45 patients (5.5%) taking vedolizumab and 9 patients (3.0%) taking placebo. The most common adverse event was exacerbation of Crohn's disease, which occurred in 164 patients (20.1%) in the vedolizumab group and 65 patients (21.6%) in the placebo group.\nThe company's submission also included safety data from 3 additional sources: GEMINI LTS, a pooled safety analysis of GEMINI I (ulcerative colitis) and GEMINI II, and an integrated safety analysis of 6 randomised placebo‑controlled trials of vedolizumab in inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease). The company noted that no cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy had been identified in any of the safety populations.\n\n【14】 ## GEMINI LTS\nIn its new evidence submitted in response to the appraisal consultation document, the company included analyses from GEMINI LTS of clinical remission for up to 2 years. Clinical remission was defined as a Harvey–Bradshaw Index score of 4 points or less. In the population in whom TNF‑alpha inhibitors had failed (n=136), clinical remission was 52% at week 52, 56% at week 80 and 51% at week 104.\n\n【15】 #Network meta‑analyses\nIn the absence of direct trial evidence, the company carried out a systematic review and network meta‑analyses to calculate relative treatment effects for vedolizumab compared with other biological therapies (adalimumab and infliximab) for treating moderate to severe Crohn's disease. Depending on available data, the company compared outcomes for clinical remission (CDAI score of 150 or less), clinical response (drop in CDAI score of 70 or greater), enhanced clinical response (drop in CDAI score of 100 or greater) and discontinuation because of adverse events.\nIn its main submission, the company identified 10 studies providing information on vedolizumab, infliximab and adalimumab and included 6 of these in its primary analysis:\nCLASSIC I, an induction study that compared adalimumab with placebo in patients who had not had TNF‑alpha inhibitor treatment before.\nSandborn , an induction study that compared adalimumab with placebo in patients who had previously had TNF‑alpha inhibitor treatment.\nTargan , an induction study that compared infliximab with placebo in patients who had not had TNF‑alpha inhibitor treatment before.\nACCENT I, a maintenance study that compared infliximab with placebo in patients who had not had TNF‑alpha inhibitor treatment before.\nGEMINI II, an induction and maintenance study that compared vedolizumab with placebo in patients who had not had TNF‑alpha inhibitor treatment before and patients in whom previous TNF‑alpha inhibitor treatment had failed.\nGEMINI III, an induction study that compared vedolizumab with placebo in patients who had not had TNF‑alpha inhibitor treatment before and patients in whom previous TNF‑alpha inhibitor treatment had failed\nThe company conducted Bayesian fixed‑effects and random‑effects analyses for the following groups in the primary analysis in its main submission:\npatients having induction treatment who had not had TNF‑alpha inhibitors before\nIt was not possible to construct a network for maintenance treatment in the population who had previously had TNF‑alpha inhibitor treatment .\nIn the network of patients in whom a TNF‑alpha inhibitor had failed and who were having induction treatment:\nnone of the trials included infliximab the vedolizumab studies included patients whose disease had previously responded inadequately (that is, primary non‑response), had lost response or became intolerant to a TNF‑alpha inhibitor whereas the comparator study included only those whose disease lost response or became intolerant to TNF‑alpha inhibitor therapy.\nResults for the 'mixed' population (that is, all patients regardless of TNF‑alpha inhibitor status) were provided as a secondary analysis. The company noted that the placebo response rates in GEMINI II were inexplicably higher than in the other studies and considered that this could bias the results against vedolizumab. It therefore considered it more appropriate to use the subgroup analyses, rather than the whole population ones that may be affected by confounding factors.\nThe company used results for clinical remission and clinical response from a network meta‑analysis for a population who had not had a TNF‑alpha inhibitor before in its economic analyses. The company submission did not state if the results were from the Bayesian or frequentist analyses. In the new evidence submitted in response to the appraisal consultation document, the company further considered a network meta‑analysis comparing vedolizumab with adalimumab and infliximab in the population for whom a TNF‑alpha inhibitor had failed. It noted a lack of comparable evidence to inform a comparison of vedolizumab and the other biological agents. No evidence was identified from the systematic review for infliximab and the adalimumab trials were in patients who had experienced secondary failure of a TNF‑alpha inhibitor, whereas GEMINI II and III enrolled patients who had experienced primary failure (inadequate or lack of response) or secondary failure (loss of response). It concluded that this meant the patients in the vedolizumab trials would be expected to have a poorer prognosis, and that the results from the network meta‑analysis would be likely to underestimate the relative effectiveness of vedolizumab. The company stated that its network meta‑analyses for induction and maintenance showed no significant difference in clinical response (induction only) or clinical remission. However, the company did not use these results in its third economic model because it considered that it was not a robust comparison .\n\n【16】 #ERG comments\nThe ERG considered the company's methods for performing the clinical effectiveness systematic review to be largely appropriate and was satisfied that all relevant vedolizumab studies had been included in the company's submission.\nThe ERG noted that GEMINI II and III assessed response in the induction phase at 6 weeks, which did not correspond with the recommended dosage in vedolizumab's summary of product characteristics. It considered assessment at 6 weeks to be earlier than in routine clinical practice in England, after receiving expert clinical advice that this is typically done 10–14 weeks after starting treatment.\nThere was a large number of US‑based study sites but apparently few UK‑based study sites.\nIn the USA, failure of either an immunomodulator (mercaptopurine or azathioprine) or a TNF‑alpha inhibitor was required, but failure of corticosteroids alone was sufficient for study entry outside the USA.\nResponse in the induction phase was assessed earlier than in clinical practice in England .\nThe long‑term efficacy and safety of vedolizumab is unknown because treatment duration in GEMINI II was 52 weeks, followed by enrolment in the ongoing GEMINI LTS study.\nInduction phase:\nWhen assessing response during induction, the ERG preferred using 10‑week data to 6‑week data because it had received clinical expert advice that response is typically assessed at 10–14 weeks in clinical practice, and because of the recommended dosage in the marketing authorisation.\nIf the Targan et al.  study comparing infliximab with placebo as an induction therapy was included in the network (which the ERG considered to be appropriate), treatment with infliximab led to significantly higher rates of clinical response and clinical remission than vedolizumab.\nRegardless of the inclusion of Targan et al. there was insufficient evidence to conclude that there is a difference in efficacy between vedolizumab and adalimumab.\nMaintenance phase:\nAll of the presented analyses had limitations, for example patients entered the maintenance phase after their treatment response was assessed earlier than commonly done in clinical practice, which the ERG considered could affect estimates of efficacy and limit generalisation to patients whose disease takes longer to respond.\nThe ERG noted that the statistical significance of the difference in response between vedolizumab and infliximab 5 mg was not reported by the company, and that there was no statistically significant difference in remission between vedolizumab and infliximab.\n\n【17】 #Company's economic model\nThe company submitted a de novo economic model that compared vedolizumab with conventional non‑biological therapy and with TNF‑alpha inhibitors in patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease. In its response to clarification, the company provided a second model that addressed some of the issues and uncertainties that had been identified. In its new evidence submitted in response to the appraisal consultation document, the company provided a third model that focused only on the subgroup of patients for whom a TNF‑alpha inhibitor had failed and addressed some of the Committee's concerns expressed in the appraisal consultation document.\nIn the induction phase, patients started treatment with vedolizumab, infliximab, adalimumab or conventional non‑biological therapy to induce a response (defined as a drop of at least 70 points of the CDAI score). In its first 2 models, the company chose a 6‑week induction phase to be consistent with the vedolizumab clinical trials. In its third model, the company changed the induction period so response was assessed at 10 weeks, which was consistent with the marketing authorisations and clinical practice. Conventional non‑biological therapy comprised aminosalicylates, corticosteroids and immunomodulators. Standard doses were assumed and the treatment mix was based upon the report of the UK Inflammatory Bowel Disease Audit Steering Group (Royal College of Physicians 2013).\nPatients who entered the induction phase on a biological therapy (that is, all treatments except conventional non‑biological therapy) and whose disease responded to treatment entered the Markov model for maintenance therapy and continued to receive biological therapy (unless they had stopped treatment because of adverse events). If their condition did not respond, or if they had stopped treatment because of adverse events, they switched to conventional non‑biological therapy. Patients who entered the induction phase on conventional non‑biological therapy could respond to treatment and enter the Markov model for conventional non‑biological therapy. If their condition did not respond, they were assumed to remain in the moderate–severe disease health state for the remainder of the model time horizon or until surgery. Regardless of response status at the end of the induction phase, patients taking conventional non‑biological therapy remained on this treatment for the remainder of the model time horizon.\nThe modelled health states in the Markov model for maintenance therapy were remission (CDAI score 150 or less), mild (CDAI score 150–220), moderate–severe (CDAI score 220–600), surgery and death. Patients could transition between each of the 4 disease severity health states (remission, mild, moderate–severe, and surgery) or experience death. It was assumed that treatment with a biological therapy was limited to 1 year, when patients switched to conventional non‑biological therapy (applied correctly in the second and third models at cycle 7  instead of at cycle 6 , as in the original model). If patients were having biological therapy, they could stop treatment because of loss of response or adverse events (whereas conventional non‑biological therapy was assumed to continue until surgery or the end of the model's time horizon). In the moderate–severe health state, patients stopped treatment after 1 year because of lack of response and switched to conventional non‑biological therapy or surgery. After surgery, patients could transition to active treatment in a CDAI‑based health state or remain in the surgery health state. The model used an age‑ and sex‑specific mortality risk, which was adjusted for time spent in each health state.\n\n【18】 ## Population\nIn its first 2 models, the company defined 3 patient groups with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease (CDAI score 220–450 points) who had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or are intolerant to either conventional non‑biological therapy or TNF alpha inhibitors.\nIn the first model, the populations were:\nthe mixed population (included patients who had not had a TNF‑alpha inhibitor before and patients in whom a TNF‑alpha inhibitor had failed, representing the intention‑to‑treat trial populations)\nthe population who had not had a TNF‑alpha inhibitor before\nThe second model additionally included data for the subgroups defined by both prior use of TNF‑alpha inhibitors and severity of disease at baseline.The company compared vedolizumab with conventional non‑biological therapy in all of these populations, but said it compared vedolizumab with the other biological treatments only in patients who had not had a TNF‑alpha inhibitor before because of limitations in the data .\nIn its third model, the company focused entirely on the subgroup of patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease (CDAI score 220–450 points) in whom a TNF‑alpha inhibitor had failed (primary and secondary failure). The cost‑effectiveness results for this subgroup generated using the third model superseded those generated using the first 2 models. The company's third model evaluated the cost effectiveness of vedolizumab compared with conventional non‑biological therapy. Because of data limitations, the company carried out an exploratory cost comparison of vedolizumab compared with other biological treatments (adalimumab and infliximab), which included scenario analyses on comparator dose escalation based on clinical expert opinion.\n\n【19】 ## Clinical parameters and transition probabilities\nTreatment efficacy included response and remission data for the induction phase, and the probability of being in remission or having mild disease at the end of 1 year (the maintenance phase of the GEMINI II study):\nFor comparisons between vedolizumab and conventional non‑biological therapy in the mixed population and in the population in whom a TNF‑alpha inhibitor had failed, the company used head‑to‑head results of GEMINI II and GEMINI III to estimate treatment efficacy.\nFor the comparisons between vedolizumab and the other biological therapies (infliximab and adalimumab) in the population who had not had a TNF‑alpha inhibitor before, the clinical parameters for vedolizumab in the company's second model were wholly derived from the network meta‑analyses provided in the company's clarification response. These superseded the original analyses in which the clinical parameters for infliximab and adalimumab were derived from the network meta‑analyses and those for vedolizumab (and conventional non‑biological therapy) were derived from GEMINI II and III.\nThe company estimated the efficacy of each treatment by estimating odds ratios using response and remission data from the network meta‑analyses (the population who had not had a TNF‑alpha inhibitor before) or from pooled trial data (the mixed population and the population in whom TNF‑alpha inhibitor treatment had failed). In the population who had not had a TNF‑alpha inhibitor before, infliximab data were derived from ACCENT I, separate from the network meta‑analysis. The company said this was because the trial by Targan et al. in the network meta‑analysis had a small sample size and did not use a standard infliximab dosage. The odds ratios were then used to estimate the percentage of patients in each health state at the end of the induction and maintenance periods. In the first 2 models, the probability of surgery was assumed to be the same across the different patient populations in the induction phase (2.03%) and maintenance phase (2.7%). In the third model, the probability of surgery was 0.83% during induction then 1.11% in each 8‑week cycle, and the probability of further surgery in the next cycle was 1.11% (amended from 33.75% in the previous models).\nThe company based the model's starting annual mortality rate on all‑cause mortality for the UK general population (0.0015). In the first 2 models, relative mortality risks were assumed to be 1.3 for mild disease, 2.3 for moderate–severe disease and 3.2 for surgery. In the third model, the relative risk of mortality was assumed to be 1 in all health states. Patients in remission were assumed to have the same mortality risk as the general UK population.\n\n【20】 ## Adverse events and surgical complications\nThe company selected adverse events to be used in its economic model based on clinical expert opinion. They included serious infection, lymphoma, acute hypersensitivity reactions and skin reactions. In the first 2 models, the probability of each adverse event occurring with each treatment was estimated from clinical trial data included in the network meta‑analyses. In the third model, the probabilities of adverse events associated with vedolizumab and conventional non‑biological therapy were obtained from summaries of product characteristics. Surgical complications in the model were also based on clinical expert opinion and the probabilities of these occurring were estimated from pooled data from a systematic literature review on surgical intervention. Annual probabilities of discontinuing biological treatment owing to adverse events were derived from clinical trials.\n\n【21】 ## Utility values\nThe company's base case used the observed EQ‑5D scores from GEMINI II and GEMINI III. The company assumed a utility value for the surgery state that was equal to that for the moderate–severe health state because patients in GEMINI II and GEMINI III were not followed for surgery. The utility values used in the model were 0.820 for remission, 0.730 for mild disease and 0.570 for both moderate–severe disease and surgery. The company applied disutilities from published literature for adverse events.\n\n【22】 ## Costs\nTreatment acquisition costs, including the estimated doses and unit costs for conventional non‑biological therapy, were taken from the British National Formulary (2013; costs updated to November 2014 edition in the third model). The patient access scheme was applied to the cost of vedolizumab as a simple discount on the list price (the level of the discount is confidential; the discount was increased in the third model). In the first 2 models, administration costs of £308 per administration in the maintenance phase and £616 in the induction phase were included for vedolizumab and infliximab (adalimumab did not have any administration costs). In the third model, a cost of £328 per administration of vedolizumab was applied in both phases.\nIn the first 2 models, health‑state costs were taken from Bodger et al.  and inflated to 2012 prices. The health‑state costs were £110 for remission, £313 for mild disease, £490 for moderate–severe disease and £10,581 for surgery, which included surgical complications. In the third model, health‑state costs were estimated based on a survey of 8 clinical experts in England. These were £100 for remission, £205 for mild disease, £1239 for moderate–severe disease and £7293 for surgery (including post‑surgery complications).\n\n【23】 ## Company base‑case results\nUsing its second model submitted in response to clarification, which replaced the original model, the company provided base‑case results incorporating the original vedolizumab patient access scheme for 3 populations:\nIn the mixed population, vedolizumab was associated with greater costs and quality‑adjusted life years (QALYs) than conventional non‑biological therapy, giving an incremental cost‑effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £62,903 per QALY gained (incremental costs £8338; incremental QALYs 0.1334).\nIn the population who had not had a TNF‑alpha inhibitor before, using network meta‑analysis data, vedolizumab was associated with lower QALYs and costs than infliximab, giving an ICER for infliximab compared with vedolizumab of £26,580 per QALY gained (incremental costs £917; incremental QALYs 0.034). Vedolizumab was associated with greater costs and QALYs than adalimumab, giving an ICER for vedolizumab compared with adalimumab of £758,344 per QALY gained (incremental costs £3497; incremental QALYs 0.005).\nUsing its third model submitted as new evidence in response to the appraisal consultation document, the company provided base‑case results incorporating the updated vedolizumab patient access scheme for the population in whom a TNF‑alpha inhibitor had failed. The deterministic ICER for vedolizumab compared with conventional non‑biological therapy was £21,620 per QALY gained (incremental costs and QALYs are confidential) and the probabilistic ICER was £27,428 per QALY gained (95% CI −7883 to 82,947). The probability of vedolizumab being cost effective compared with conventional non‑biological therapy at a maximum acceptable ICER of £30,000 was 61%.\n\n【24】 ## Company sensitivity and scenario analyses\nFor the original model, the company concluded that its deterministic sensitivity analyses showed that the key drivers were transition probabilities (in particular for remission), health state costs and utility values. It noted that assuming a longer time horizon in the original model made vedolizumab more cost effective in all populations. The company did not provide any sensitivity analyses using its second model.\nFor its third model, the company concluded that its deterministic sensitivity analyses showed that the ICER was most sensitive to variation in the conventional non‑biological therapy arm transition probabilities from the moderately–severely active state and from the remission state. It noted that the scenario analyses showed that the ICER increased most markedly when the time horizon was reduced to 10 years, when enhanced response was used to determine progression to maintenance treatment (100‑CDAI point decrease), when response was assessed at week 6 and when efficacy data were based solely on GEMINI II. The company's scenario analyses showed that continuing treatment with vedolizumab for 2 or 3 years (instead of 1 year) increased the ICER to £24,695 and £26,207 per QALY gained respectively.\n\n【25】 ## Company exploratory analyses\nThe company carried out exploratory cost‑comparison analyses that compared vedolizumab with adalimumab and with infliximab in the population in whom a TNF‑alpha inhibitor had failed. The results of these analyses are confidential.\n\n【26】 #ERG comments on the company main submission\nIn its original report, the ERG critiqued the company's cost‑effectiveness evidence, focusing on the second model provided at the clarification stage. The ERG was largely satisfied with the company's explanation about why it chose its model structure (adapted from Bodger et al.)\n\n【27】 ## Model structure\nThe ERG expressed concerns about the structure of the company's model in 4 main areas:\nIt did not capture that Crohn's disease is a relapsing and remitting condition (that is, patients may experience spontaneous exacerbations and improvements). The company's model assumed that patients whose disease did not respond to conventional non‑biological therapy at week 6 remained in the non‑responder state and had moderate to severe Crohn's disease until death or surgery, which it considered to be overly pessimistic.\nSurgery was modelled as a single health state, which may be overly simplistic because subsequent surgery is likely to depend on the type of initial surgery. However, the ERG recognised the possible lack of data in this area and believed that the impact on results would be minimal.\nThere were difficulties associated with parameterising the company's chosen structure, including how the transition probabilities were derived and how the model predictions were calibrated .\nSome of the key structural assumptions that influenced the derivation of transition probabilities were considered debatable. These included:\nPatients whose disease did not respond were assumed to have moderate to severe disease, which the ERG considered to be inappropriate. This is because these patients could have a drop in CDAI score of less than 70 points that would mean their disease would be reclassified as mild.\nExcept for continuing biological treatment after induction, no distinction was made between patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease whose disease responded and patients whose disease did not respond. The ERG believed that outcomes would be likely to differ between these groups.\nAll patients still having TNF‑alpha inhibitor therapy at approximately 1 year were assumed to switch to conventional non‑biological therapy. Based on the recommendations in the NICE technology appraisal guidance on infliximab (review) and adalimumab for the treatment of Crohn's disease, the ERG considered that a discontinuation rule may be appropriate for patients in remission, but not for patients whose disease is not in stable clinical remission.\nIt was assumed that there was no increase in relapse after withdrawal of biological treatment in patients in the remission or mild disease health states, which was not aligned with clinical expert opinion received by the ERG.\nThe efficacy of conventional non‑biological therapy was assumed to be independent of previous biological treatment (that is, conventional non‑biological therapy was equally effective in patients who had previously had biological treatment as those who had not). The ERG considered that this would be unlikely.\nDiscontinuation owing to lack of efficacy during the maintenance phase was not included in the company's economic model. Based on its interpretation of the data from the GEMINI trials, the ERG believed this should be incorporated.\nVedolizumab was given in 2 doses at weeks 0 and 2 with assessment at week 6. The ERG considered it more appropriate to follow the marketing authorisation more closely by using the induction regimen from GEMINI III (that is, doses at weeks 0, 2 and 6 with assessment at week 10).\nAdalimumab was administered at 80 mg at week 0, then 40 mg at weeks 2, 4 and 6 with assessment at week 6. The ERG considered it preferable to administer 80 mg at week 0 and 40 mg at week 2, with assessment at week 4, which was more consistent with adalimumab's marketing authorisation.The ERG believed that 3 doses of vedolizumab should be used during induction, rather than the 2 assumed in the company's base case, which would increase the treatment cost. It considered that 3 doses of adalimumab 40 mg should be given in the induction phase rather than 5 doses, which would decrease the cost. The ERG was satisfied with the infliximab induction regimen used in the company's model because this reflected the marketing authorisation and the efficacy data used in the company's model.\n\n【28】 ## Population\nThe ERG was unclear how results from the mixed intention‑to‑treat population could be interpreted. It believed that patients who had previously had TNF‑alpha inhibitors and those who had never had TNF‑alpha inhibitors are 2 distinct patient groups with different characteristics and likelihood of responding to treatment. It considered that the results from the 2 groups should be interpreted separately.\n\n【29】 ## Clinical parameters\nAlthough the ERG recognised that the Targan trial comparing infliximab with placebo had limitations, it believed that it should have been included in the network meta‑analysis for infliximab and used in the base case, potentially adjusting for small sample size. The ERG noted that the company had instead used data for infliximab from the placebo‑controlled ACCENT I trial (separate from the network meta‑analysis), but had not discussed the trial's limitations. The ERG noted that including data for adalimumab from the trial by Watanabe et al. as well as CLASSIC I in the primary analysis would likely increase the probabilities of remission and response for adalimumab.\nThe ERG was unclear from the company submission and the publication by Bodger et al. how the transition probabilities for patients having surgery had been calculated. It considered the values used by the company for transitioning from surgery to surgery in the next cycle to be high (33.75%), and was not satisfied by the company's explanation. The ERG was not able to predict how correcting the transition matrix for movement between states after surgery would affect the ICERs.\n\n【30】 ## Utility values\nThe ERG was largely satisfied with the company's approach to estimating utility values for the different health states in its model, but had some concerns:\nThe same utility value was used for patients with moderate to severe disease, regardless of any response to treatment. The ERG considered that this was unlikely to be true because it implied that response (that is, improvement in symptoms) does not improve health.\nHowever, the ERG anticipated that any impact on the ICERs would be minimal.\n\n【31】 ## Cost‑effectiveness results\nThe ERG noted that the company presented pairwise comparisons rather than a fully incremental analysis for the group who had not had a TNF‑alpha inhibitor before and that it had not provided updated cost‑effectiveness estimates for all of the patient groups covered by the original model. The ERG therefore extracted this information from the company's second model. In the group which had not had a TNF‑alpha inhibitor before, a fully incremental analysis gave the following ICERs:\n£19,705 per QALY gained (incremental costs £4146; incremental QALYs 0.2104) for adalimumab compared with conventional non‑biological therapy\n£112,882 per QALY gained (incremental costs £4414; incremental QALYs 0.0391) for infliximab compared with adalimumab\n£758,344 per QALY gained for vedolizumab compared with adalimumab (incremental costs £3497; incremental QALYs 0.005), which was greater than that for infliximab compared with vedolizumab (£26,580 per QALY gained ). This meant that vedolizumab was subject to extended dominance.The ERG could not confirm the results of subgroup analyses according to disease severity for the population who had not had a TNF‑alpha inhibitor before because it was unclear how the data for patients who received infliximab and adalimumab had been estimated in the company's second model.\nIn the mixed population and in the population in whom a TNF‑alpha inhibitor had failed, vedolizumab was associated with greater costs and QALYs compared with conventional non‑biological therapy in subgroups according to disease severity, with ICERs of:\n£21,064 per QALY gained (incremental costs £6447; incremental QALYs 0.3061) for the mixed population with moderate disease\n£134,330 per QALY gained (incremental costs £7926; incremental QALYs 0.0590) for the population in whom a TNF‑alpha inhibitor had failed with severe disease.The ERG was concerned that the number of patients with moderate to severe disease regularly did not match the number of patients with moderate disease plus the number of patients with severe disease. It also had concerns about the validity of the calibrated transition probabilities.\nUsing the company's second model, the ERG reported the results from the scenario analyses presented in the original company submission. It noted that the ICER was sensitive to all the scenarios considered, especially the time horizon and health state utility values.\nFor transparency, the ERG extracted the probabilistic ICERs using the second version of the company's model and noted that these were consistent with the deterministic ICERs. In a fully incremental comparison, the ERG reported that the probability of vedolizumab being cost effective was less than 1% at a maximum acceptable ICER of £20,000 per QALY gained for all 3 populations in the base case of the company's second model. The probability of cost effectiveness increased to about 2% at a maximum acceptable ICER of £30,000 per QALY gained.\n\n【32】 #ERG comments on the company's new evidence submitted in response to the appraisal consultation document\nThe ERG was satisfied with the most recent company changes made to the model, but continued to have concerns about the third model's structure and parameterisation. The remaining issues included:\nPotential omission of key aspects of the condition (for example, its relapsing–remitting nature).\nSimplifying and debatable assumptions regarding surgery.\nDifficulty associated with parameterising the model's structure (notably deriving transition matrices).\nDebatable assumptions including ending maintenance at 1 year, omitting discontinuation due to lack of efficacy and that patients receiving conventional non‑biological therapy whose disease did not respond during the induction phase remain in the moderate–severe health state (and are not able to improve).The ERG noted that, as with previous versions, the third model tended to under‑predict the proportion of patients receiving conventional non‑biological therapy who were in remission.\n\n【33】 #ERG exploratory analyses\nBecause of its concerns about the model structure, the ERG was not able to provide a robust ICER for vedolizumab using any of the company's 3 models. The ERG was unclear whether vedolizumab's cost effectiveness would improve or deteriorate after addressing the structural issues.\nThe ERG carried out a stepwise verification of the individual changes made in building the company's third model, and identified those that had the greatest impact on the ICER for vedolizumab compared with conventional non‑biological therapy in the population in whom a TNF‑alpha inhibitor had failed. It found that increasing the time horizon from 10 years to lifetime reduced the ICER from the previous base‑case ICER of £98,452 per QALY gained to £57,481 per QALY gained. When the health‑state costs were derived from a survey of 8 clinical experts based in England rather than the literature , the ICER dropped from £56,223 to £35,154 per QALY gained.\n#Consideration of the evidence\nThe Appraisal Committee reviewed the data available on the clinical and cost effectiveness of vedolizumab, having considered evidence on the nature of Crohn's disease and the value placed on the benefits of vedolizumab by people with the condition, those who represent them, and clinical experts. It also took into account the effective use of NHS resources.\nThe Committee discussed the impact of moderately to severely active Crohn's disease and its treatment on people who have the disease. It heard from the patient experts that disease symptoms were debilitating and that experiencing and maintaining remission were vital to maximising quality of life, including improved social life and employment prospects. For example, it noted the experience of 1 patient expert that ongoing symptoms for over 10 years without remission had forced a career change. The Committee also understood from the patient experts that disease symptoms could have a wide‑ranging and devastating impact in areas such as mental health, relationships, and personal and social development (which it heard was especially important to younger people during their formative years). It heard that patients dreaded loss of remission and further flare‑ups of the disease because of the major impact these have on their lives. It also heard that it was very important to have other treatment options if their treatment stopped working to enable them to regain remission, The clinical and patient experts agreed that they preferred to manage Crohn's disease medically rather than surgically wherever possible. The Committee concluded that a further drug treatment that improves symptoms or brings the disease into remission would be highly valued by patients.\n\n【34】 #Clinical effectiveness\nThe Committee discussed the generalisability of the GEMINI II and III trial populations. The Committee noted that, although a patient's Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score could potentially exceed 600, the maximum CDAI score permitted at trial entry was 450. It heard from the clinical experts that only a few patients with a CDAI score greater than 450 were seen in routine clinical practice and consequently considered that the spectrum of disease severity in patients in GEMINI II and III (CDAI score 220–450) was broadly comparable to that seen in clinical practice. The Committee concluded that the clinical characteristics of the populations in GEMINI II and III were generalisable to the population likely to have vedolizumab in clinical practice in England.\nThe Committee discussed the induction regimens used in GEMINI II and III, including the timing of response assessment. It heard from the clinical experts that clinical trials used stringent definitions of response and remission, including the timing of assessment, whereas this was more flexible in clinical practice. The Committee noted that in the marketing authorisation for vedolizumab, the recommended induction dosing regimen is 300 mg at weeks 0, 2 and 6, corresponding with the induction regimen in GEMINI III, whereas patients in GEMINI II had vedolizumab at weeks 0 and 2. The Committee also noted that, although response was assessed at 6 weeks in GEMINI II and III, the marketing authorisation allowed for an additional dose to be given at week 10 (with the first dose of maintenance treatment administered at week 14). The Committee further noted that the company's new evidence submitted in response to the appraisal consultation document stated that, in patients in whom a TNF‑alpha inhibitor had failed, a numerically higher percentage of patients experienced remission at 10 weeks than at 6 weeks. The Committee heard from the clinical experts that they considered 6 weeks to be too early to discontinue treatment if a response had not been observed, and that induction response would generally be assessed later than this in clinical practice. It further heard that assessing remission rates at 6 weeks, may therefore not have reflected vedolizumab's true clinical efficacy, and that in clinical practice a patient was likely to have 4 doses before a decision was made to discontinue treatment because of a lack of response. The Committee concluded that assessing response at 6 weeks, as in GEMINI II and III, would not detect all patients whose disease would respond to induction treatment, and that using data from later time points in the trials could potentially increase the efficacy estimates for vedolizumab.\nThe Committee considered the validity and usefulness of the company's network meta‑analyses that were provided at the clarification stage for the population who had not had a TNF‑alpha inhibitor before. It considered the population in the network meta‑analyses to be broadly generalisable to the population presenting after conventional non‑biological therapy has failed in clinical practice in England. However, it had several concerns:\nIt heard from the clinical experts that placebo response rates varied considerably in Crohn's disease trials and that a meta‑analysis comparing all treatments against a common placebo response had limitations.\nThe Committee noted the ERG's assertion that a random‑effects model should be used instead of a fixed‑effects model, and considered that this would be more appropriate.\nIt had several specific concerns about the induction analysis:\nThe Committee also had concerns about the network meta‑analyses for the maintenance phase:\nNo primary analyses had been presented that included adalimumab (although it was aware that the company's model included data that estimated the relative treatment effect of vedolizumab and adalimumab).The Committee concluded that the combination of these factors meant there was considerable uncertainty in the company's network meta analyses results for the population who had not had a TNF alpha inhibitor before.\n\n【35】 #Cost effectiveness\nThe Committee took into account the ERG's and the company's view that it was more meaningful to evaluate vedolizumab according to TNF‑alpha inhibitor status rather than the mixed population, because the results of the mixed analysis were difficult to interpret and generalise to the NHS .\nThe Committee considered the structure of the company's economic model. It noted the ERG's concerns about several structural assumptions, including that the relapsing and remitting nature of the disease had not been captured, the simplistic approach to modelling surgery, the assumption that all patients whose condition did not respond to treatment had moderate to severe disease for the full duration of the model and that there would be no difference in outcomes between patients whose disease responded and patients whose disease did not respond in the moderate to severe health state. The Committee heard from the clinical experts that, for patients in whom multiple lines of therapy failed, the assumption of long‑term continuation in the moderate to severe state as in the company's model was not unreasonable. The Committee concluded that the number of concerns raised by the ERG meant that it was uncertain if the model was structurally sound but that, overall, it was acceptable to inform its decision‑making.\nThe Committee discussed the clinical parameters used in the company's economic models. For the population in whom a TNF‑alpha inhibitor had failed, it accepted that the network meta‑analyses did not permit a robust comparison with the other biological therapies . For the population who had not had a TNF‑alpha inhibitor before, it noted that the company's submission was unclear about which results from the network meta‑analyses had informed the model. The Committee was aware that the ERG considered that the results of the company's network meta‑analysis could underestimate the uncertainty in treatment effects, because fixed‑effects models had been used despite evidence of heterogeneity among the clinical trials in the network. The Committee noted the ERG's concerns about the lack of information about how the GEMINI II and III results had been pooled, and the estimated rates of discontinuation because of adverse events. It noted further concerns that the company had used data from the single‑arm ACCENT‑I trial but excluded the placebo‑controlled Targan trial when estimating the relative treatment effect of vedolizumab compared with infliximab during induction, and that the company had not discussed the limitations associated with ACCENT‑I. It recalled that the ERG was not satisfied with the company's approach to modelling maintenance data for vedolizumab compared with adalimumab because CLASSIC II had been excluded . Lastly, the Committee agreed that, in the absence of data suggesting otherwise, it should be assumed that the mortality rate is the same for all treatments and that the same risk should be applied to all Crohn's disease health states (as in the third model). The Committee concluded that, for the population in whom a TNF‑alpha inhibitor had failed, it was appropriate to derive the clinical parameters from the GEMINI II and III clinical trial results for the comparison of vedolizumab with conventional non‑biological therapy. The Committee further concluded that the clinical parameters derived from the network meta‑analyses for the population who had not had a TNF‑alpha inhibitor before were subject to considerable uncertainty.\nThe Committee considered the cost‑effectiveness results for vedolizumab compared with conventional non‑biological treatment and TNF‑alpha inhibitors in people with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease. It noted that the ERG did not consider the company's ICERs to be robust because of the model's structural issues, and that consequently the ERG had not conducted exploratory analyses\n\n【36】 #Summary of Appraisal Committee's key conclusions\nTA352\nAppraisal title: Vedolizumab for treating moderately to severely active Crohn's disease after prior therapy\n\n【37】 Key conclusion\nVedolizumab is recommended as an option for treating moderately to severely active Crohn's disease only if:\na tumour necrosis factor‑alpha inhibitor has failed (that is the disease has responded inadequately or has lost response to treatment) or\nThe Committee considered that the incremental cost‑effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for vedolizumab compared with conventional non‑biological treatment in people in whom tumour necrosis factor (TNF) alpha treatment has failed were within the range that would normally be considered a cost‑effective use of NHS resources (that is, £20,000–30,000 per quality‑adjusted life year  gained). It concluded that vedolizumab should be recommended for people in whom TNF‑alpha inhibitor treatment has failed; however, if treatment lasts for longer than 1 year, people receiving it should be reassessed at 12 months and then at least annually to see if continued treatment is justified.\nThe Committee appreciated the high unmet clinical need in people for whom TNF‑alpha inhibitors were contraindicated or not tolerated and concluded that it was reasonable for vedolizumab to be prescribed for this group.\nCurrent practice\nClinical need of patients, including the availability of alternative treatments\nThe technology\nProposed benefits of the technology\nHow innovative is the technology in its potential to make a significant and substantial impact on health‑related benefits?\nVedolizumab (Entyvio, Takeda UK) is a humanised IgG1 monoclonal antibody derived from a newly engineered cell line. It is targeted against α4β7 integrin, which is expressed on certain white blood cells. α4β7 integrin is responsible for recruiting these cells to inflamed bowel tissue.\nWhat is the position of the treatment in the pathway of care for the condition?\nAdverse reactions\nEvidence for clinical effectiveness\nAvailability, nature and quality of evidence\nRelevance to general clinical practice in the NHS\nUncertainties generated by the evidence\nThe Committee concluded that assessing response at 6 weeks, as in GEMINI II and III, would not detect all patients whose disease would respond to induction treatment.\nAre there any clinically relevant subgroups for which there is evidence of differential effectiveness?\nEstimate of the size of the clinical effectiveness including strength of supporting evidence\nUncertainties around and plausibility of assumptions and inputs in the economic model\nThe Committee considered that the dosing assumptions used in the company's first 2 models did not necessarily give an accurate estimate of costs and clinical outcomes in clinical practice. However, the Committee was satisfied with the dosing assumptions used in the company's third model, and concluded that evaluating response at 10 weeks was appropriate.\nIncorporation of health‑related quality‑of‑life benefits and utility values\nHave any potential significant and substantial health‑related benefits been identified that were not included in the economic model, and how have they been considered?\nNot applicable.\nWhat are the key drivers of cost effectiveness?\nThe key drivers of the ICER included many of the transition probabilities, health state costs, utility values and time horizon.\nMost likely cost‑effectiveness estimate (given as an ICER)\nBecause the ERG had not conducted exploratory analyses, the Committee was only able to consider the company's ICERs.

There are three common types of skin cancer, each of which is named after the type of skin cell from which it arises. Cancers caused by UV exposure may be prevented by avoiding exposure to sunlight or other UV sources, wearing sun-protective clothes, and using a broad-spectrum sun screen.\nSkin cancers are the fastest growing type of cancer in the United States.

Its ultimate aim is to create self-managing computer systems to overcome their rapidly growing complexity and to enable their further growth.\n\n【1】 #The problem of growing complexity\nSelf-management means different things in different fields:\nThe number of computing devices in use is forecast to grow at 38% per annum and the average complexity of each is increasing . Currently this volume and complexity is managed by highly skilled humans but the demand for skilled IT personnel is already outstripping supply, with labour costs exceeding equipment costs by a ratio of up to 18:1 . Computing has brought great benefits of speed and automation but there is now an overwhelming economic need to automate their maintenance.\nIn ‘The Vision of Autonomic Computing’, Kephart and Chess warn that the dream of interconnectivity of computing systems and devices could become the “nightmare of pervasive computing” in which architects are unable to anticipate, design and maintain the complexity of interactions. They state the essence of autonomic computing is system self-management, freeing administrators of low-levsk management whilst delivering an optimized system.\nA general problem of modern distributed computing systems is that their complexity is increasingly becoming the limiting factor in their further development. Large companies and institutions are employing large-scale computer networks for communication and computation. The distributed applications running on these computer networks are diverse and deal with many different tasks, ranging from internal control processes to presenting web content and to customer support.\nAdditionally, Mobile computing is pervading these networks at an increasing speed: Employees need to communicate with their companies while they are not in their office. They do so by using laptops, PDAs, or mobile phones with diverse forms of wireless technologies to access their companies' data.\nThis creates an enormous complexity in the overall computer network which is hard to control manually by one or more human operators. Manual control is time-consuming, expensive, and error-prone. The manual effort needed to control a growing networked computer system tends to increase very quickly.\n80% of such problems in infrastructure happen at the client specific application and database layer. Most 'autonomic' service providers guarantee only up to the basic plumbing layer (power, hardware, operating system, network and basic database parameters).\n\n【2】 #Autonomic systems\nA possible solution could be to enable modern, networked computing systems to manage themselves without direct human intervention. The Autonomic Computing Initiative (ACI) aims at providing the foundation for autonomic systems. It is inspired by the autonomic nervous system of the human body. This nervous system controls important bodily functions (e.g. respiration, heart rate, and blood pressure) without any conscious intervention.\nIn a self-managing system Autonomic System, the human operator takes on a new role: He does not control the system directly. Instead, he defines general policies and rules that serve as an input for the self-management process. For this process, IBM has defined the following four functional areas:\n- Self-Configuration: Automatic configuration of components;\n- Self-Optimization: Automatic monitoring and control of resources to ensure the optimal functioning with respect to the defined requirements;\n- Self-Protection: Proactive identification and protection from arbitrary attacks.\nIBM defined five evolutionary levels, or the Autonomic deployment model, for its deployment: Level 1 is the basic level that presents the current situation where systems are essentially managed manually. Levels 2 - 4 introduce increasingly automated management functions, while level 5 represents the ultimate goal of autonomic, self-managing systems.\n\n【3】 #Control loops\nA basic concept that shall be applied in Autonomic Systems are closed control loops. This well-known concept stems from Process Control Theory. Essentially, a closed control loop in a self-managing system monitors some resource (software or hardware component) and autonomously tries to keep its parameters within a desired range.\nAccording to the visionaries from IBM, hundreds or even thousands of these control loops are expected to work in a large-scale self-managing computer system.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

The first CDC Guideline for Prevention of Nosocomial Pneumonia was published in 1981 and addressed the main infection-control problems related to hospital-acquired pneumonia at the time: the use of large-volume nebulizers that were attached to mechanical ventilators and improper reprocessing (i.e. cleaning and disinfection or sterilization) of respiratory-care equipment. The document also covered the prevention and control of hospital-acquired influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection.\nIn 1994, the Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC) (then known as the Hospital Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee) revised and expanded the CDC Guideline for Prevention of Nosocomial Pneumonia to include Legionnaires disease and pulmonary aspergillosis . HICPAC advises the secretary of Health and Human Services and the directors of CDC about the prevention and control of health-care-associated infections and related adverse events. The 1994 guideline addressed concerns related to preventing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) (e.g. the role of stress-ulcer prophylaxis in the causation of pneumonia and the contentious roles of selective gastrointestinal decontamination and periodic changes of ventilator tubings in the prevention of the infection). The report also presented major changes in the recommendations to prevent and control hospital-acquired pneumonia caused by Legionnella spp. and aspergilli.\nThis report consists of Parts II and III of a three-part document  and contains the consensus HICPAC recommendations for the prevention of the following infections: bacterial pneumonia, Legionnaires disease, pertussis, invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA), lower respiratory tract infections caused by RSV, parainfluenza and adenoviruses, and influenza. Part III provides suggested performance indicators to assist infection-control personnel in monitoring the implementation of the guideline recommendations in their facilities.\nPart I of the guideline provides the background for the recommendations and includes a discussion of the epidemiology, diagnosis, pathogenesis, modes of transmission, and prevention and control of the infections . Part I can be an important resource for educating health-care personnel. Because education of health-care personnel is the cornerstone of an effective infection-control program, health-care agencies should give high priority to continuing infection-control education programs for their staff members.\nHICPAC recommendations address such issues as education of health-care personnel about the prevention and control of health-care-associated pneumonia and other lower respiratory tract infections, surveillance and reporting of diagnosed cases of infections, prevention of person-to-person transmission of each disease, and reduction of host risk for infection.\nLower respiratory tract infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis is not addressed in this document; however, it is covered in a separate publication .\n\n【2】 #Key Terms Used In the Guideline\nProtective environment (PE) is a specialized patient-care area, usually in a hospital, with a positive air flow relative to the corridor (i.e. air flows from the room to the outside adjacent space). The combination of high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration, high numbers (>12) of air changes per hour (ACH), and minimal leakage of air into the room creates an environment that can safely accommodate patients who have received allogeneic hemopoietic stem-cell transplant (HSCT).\nImmunocompromised patients are those patients whose immune mechanisms are deficient because of immunologic disorders (e.g. human immunodeficiency virus  infection, congenital immune deficiency syndrome, and chronic diseases ), or immunosuppressive therapy (e.g. radiation, cytotoxic chemotherapy, anti-rejection medication, and steroids). Immunocompromised patients who are identified as patients at high risk have the greatest risk for infection and include persons with severe neutropenia (i.e. an absolute neutrophil count  of <500 cells/mL) for prolonged periods of time, recipients of allogeneic HSCT, and those who receive the most intensive chemotherapy (e.g. patients with childhood acute myelogenous leukemia).\n\n【3】 #Abbreviations Used In the Guideline\nACIP\n\n【4】 #Categorization of Recommendations\nIn this document, each recommendation is categorized on the basis of existing scientific evidence, theoretical rationale, applicability, and potential economic impact. In addition, a new category accommodates recommendations that are made on the basis of existing national or state health regulations. The following categorization scheme is applied in this guideline:\nCategory IA. Strongly recommended for implementation and strongly supported by well-designed experimental, clinical, or epidemiologic studies.\nNo recommendation; unresolved issue. Practices for which insufficient evidence or no consensus exists about efficacy.\n\n【5】 #Prevention of Health-Care-Associated\nBacterial Pneumonia\n\n【6】 #I. Staff Education and Involvement in Infection Prevention\nEducate health-care workers about the epidemiology of, and infection-control procedures for, preventing healthcare-associated bacterial pneumonia to ensure worker competency according to the worker's level of responsibility in the health-care setting, and involve the workers in the implementation of interventions to prevent healthcare-associated pneumonia by using performanceimprovement tools and techniques (IA) .\n\n【7】 #II. Infection and Microbiologic Surveillance\nA. Conduct surveillance for bacterial pneumonia in intensive care unit (ICU) patients who are at high risk for health-care-related bacterial pneumonia (e.g. patients with mechanically assisted ventilation or selected postoperative patients) to determine trends and help identify outbreaks and other potential infection-control problems .\n\n【8】 #I. Staff Education\nProvide health-care personnel continuing education or access to continuing education about the epidemiology, modes of transmission, diagnosis, and means of preventing the spread of influenza, in accordance with their level of responsibility in preventing health-care-associated influenza (II) ,109.\n\n【9】 #II. Surveillance\nA. Establish mechanisms by which facility personnel are promptly alerted about increased influenza activity in the community (II). B. Establish protocols for intensifying efforts to promptly diagnose cases of facility-acquired influenza 1. Determine the threshold incidence or prevalence of influenza or influenza-like illness in the facility at which laboratory testing of patients with influenza-like illness is to be undertaken and outbreak control measures are to be initiated (II) . 2. Arrange for laboratory tests to be available to clinicians for prompt diagnosis of influenza, especially during November-April (II) .\n\n【10】 #Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome\nUpdated information about prevention and control of severe acute respiratory syndrome in health-care facilities is available in a separate publication .\n\n【11】 #Part III: Performance Indicators\nTo assist infection-control personnel in assessing personnel adherence to the recommendations, the following performance measures are suggested: 1. Monitor rates of VAP; can use established benchmarks and definitions of pneumonia (e.g. NNIS definitions and rates) . Provide feedback to the staff about the facility's VAP rates and reminders about the need for personnel to adhere to infection-control practices that reduce the incidence of VAP. 2. Establish a SOP for influenza vaccination and monitor the percentage of eligible patients in acute-care settings or patients or residents in long-term-care settings who receive the vaccine. 3. Before and during the influenza season, monitor and record the number of eligible health-care personnel who receive the influenza vaccine and determine the desired unit-and facility-specific vaccination rates as recommended by ACIP. 4. Monitor the number of cases of health-care-associated RSV infections by geographic location within the facility and give prompt feedback to appropriate staff members to improve adherence to recommended infectioncontrol precautions. 5. Periodically review clinicians' use of laboratory diagnostic tests (both culture of appropriate respiratory specimen and the urine antigen test) for legionellosis, especially in patients who are at high risk for acquiring the disease (e.g. patients who are immunosuppressed, including recipients of HSCT or solid-organ transplant, or patients receiving systemic steroids; patients aged >65 years; or patients who have chronic underlying disease such as diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, and COPD). Provide feedback on the use of these tests to clinicians. 6. During construction or renovation activities in the facility, monitor personnel adherence to infection-control measures (e.g. use of barriers, maintenance of negative room pressure) that are aimed at minimizing dust dispersion in patient-care areas. Review all cases of healthcare-associated aspergillosis to determine the presence of remediable environmental risks. 7. Periodically monitor the frequency of diagnostic testing for pertussis and the time interval between suspicion of the infection and initiation of isolation precautions for patients in whom pertussis is suspected.\nknow what matters.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Sputum is a thick fluid produced in the lungs and in the airways leading to the lungs. A sample of sputum is placed in a container with substances that promote the growth of bacteria or fungi. If no bacteria or fungi grow, the culture is negative. If organisms that can cause infection (pathogenic organisms) grow, the culture is positive. The type of bacterium or fungus will be identified with a microscope or by chemical tests.\nIf bacteria or fungi that can cause infection grow in the culture, other tests may be done to determine which antibiotic will be most effective in treating the infection. This is called susceptibility or sensitivity testing.\nThis test is done on a sample of sputum that is usually collected by coughing. For people who cannot cough deeply enough to produce a sample, a suction tube or needle may be inserted in the airway to collect the sputum.\nIn a hospital setting, a sputum culture is most commonly ordered if a patient has a pneumonia.  The Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends that sputum cultures be done in pneumonia requiring hospitalization, while the American College of Chest Physicians does not.  The reasons for the discrepancy is that normal, healthy lungs have bacteria, and sputum cultures collect both normal bacteria and the bacteria causing disease.

It is rarely due to Entamoeba histolytica.\n\n【3】 #Epidemiology and Demographics\nBalamuthia infection is very rare but often causes fatal disease. Since Balamuthia was first discovered in 1986, about 200 cases of infection have been reported worldwide. This number includes at least 70 confirmed cases in the United States.\n\n【4】 #Risk Factors\nThe Balamuthia amoeba is able to infect  anyone, including healthy people. Those at increased risk for infection include people with HIV/AIDS, cancer, liver disease, or  diabetes mellitus, people taking immune system inhibiting drugs, alcoholics, young  children or the elderly and pregnant women\n\n【5】 #Causes\nBalamuthia mandrillaris has only recently been isolated from the environment and has also been isolated from autopsy specimens of infected humans and animals. B. mandrillaris has only two stages, cysts  and trophozoites , in its life cycle. No flagellated stage exists as part of the life cycle. The trophozoites replicate by mitosis (nuclear membrane does not remain intact) . The trophozoites are the infective forms, although both cysts and trophozoites gain entry into the body  through various means. Entry can occur through the nasal passages to the lower respiratory tract , or ulcerated or broken skin . When B. mandrillaris enters the respiratory system or through the skin, it can invade the central nervous system by hematogenous dissemination causing granulomatous amebic encephalitis (GAE)  or disseminated disease , or skin lesions  in individuals who are immune competent as well as those with compromised immune systems. B. mandrillaris cysts and trophozoites are found in tissue.\n\n【6】 ## History and Symptoms\nBalamuthia infection is very rare. The Balamuthia amebas can infect the skin, sinuses, brain and other organs of the body. Therefore, Balamuthia infection can cause a wide range of symptoms. Disease  can begin with a skin wound on the face, trunk, or limbs and can then progress  to the brain where it cause a disease called Granulomatous Amebic Encephalitis\n\n【7】 ## Laboratory Findings\nThe indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) is a test used to detect antibodies attached to Balamuthia amebas in body tissues. In contrast, immunohistochemistry (IHC) uses specific antibodies against Balamuthia to detect the amoebas. Finally, a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) molecular assay can detect Balamuthia DNA.\n\n【8】 ## MRI\n\n【9】 ## CT\nA computerized tomography scan may demonstrate bilateral low-density areas with mild mass effect in the cortex and subcortical white matter.\n\n【10】 ## Medical Therapy\nGAE can, in general, must be treated by killing the pathogenic amoebas which cause it. Even with treatment, the condition is often fatal, and there are very few recorded survivors, almost all of whom suffered permanent neurocognitive deficits. Several drugs have been shown to be effective against GAE-causing organisms in vitro.\n\n【11】 ## Primary Prevention\nCurrently, there are no known ways to prevent infection with Balamuthia since it is unclear how and why some people become infected while others do not.\nThere have been no reports of a Balamuthia infection spreading from one person  to another except through organ donation/transplantation.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Common adverse reactions include neck/throat/jaw pain/tightness/pressure, dizziness, paresthesia, asthenia, somnolence, warm/cold sensation, nausea, heaviness sensation, and dry mouth.\n\n【2】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Adult)\n- ZOMIG is indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults.\n- The recommended starting dose of ZOMIG is 1.25 mg or 2.5 mg. The 1.25 mg dose can be achieved by manually breaking the functionally-scored 2.5 mg tablet in half. The maximum recommended single dose of ZOMIG is 5 mg.\n- In controlled clinical trials, a greater proportion of patients had headache response following a 2.5 mg or 5 mg dose than following a 1 mg dose. There was little added benefit from the 5 mg dose compared to the 2.5 mg dose, but adverse reactions were more frequent with the 5 mg dose.\nThe safety of ZOMIG in the treatment of an average of more than three migraines in a 30-day period has not been established.\n\n【3】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Zolmitriptan in adult patients.\n\n【4】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n- Oral zolmitriptan 10 mg.\n- Dose varied according to baseline headache intensity: Zolmitriptan 1.25 mg (half tablet) for mild attacks, 2.5 mg for moderate attacks, and 5 mg (2 tablets) for severe attacks.\n\n【5】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Pediatric)\nThere is limited information regarding FDA-Labeled Use of Zolmitriptan in pediatric patients.\n\n【6】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Zolmitriptan in pediatric patients.\n\n【7】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Zolmitriptan in pediatric patients.\n\n【8】 #Contraindications\n- Ischemic coronary artery disease (angina pectoris, history of myocardial infarction, or documented silent ischemia), other significant underlying cardiovascular disease, or  coronary artery vasospasm including Prinzmetal’s angina.\n- Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders.\n- History of stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), or history of hemiplegic or basilar migraine because these patients are at a higher risk of stroke.\n- Peripheral vascular disease (PVD).\n- Ischemic bowel disease.\n- Uncontrolled hypertension.\n- Recent use (i.e. within 24 hours) of another 5-HT 1 agonist, ergotamine-containing medication, or ergot-type medication (such as dihydroergotamine or methysergide).\n- Concurrent administration of a monoamine oxidase (MAO)-A inhibitor or recent use of a MAO-A inhibitor (that is within 2 weeks).\n- Known hypersensitivity to ZOMIG or ZOMIG ZMT (angioedema and anaphylaxis seen).\n\n【9】 ### Precautions\n- Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal Angina - ZOMIG is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic coronary artery disease (CAD). There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of ZOMIG. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. 5-HT1 agonists including ZOMIG may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal Angina), even in patients without a history of CAD.\n- Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-naïve patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g. increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving ZOMIG. Do not administer ZOMIG if there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm . For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administrating the first ZOMIG dose in a medically-supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following ZOMIG administration. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of ZOMIG.\n- Arrhythmias\n- Chest, Throat, Neck and Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure\n- Cerebrovascular Events\n- Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine, when they were not.\n- As with other acute migraine therapies, before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with symptoms atypical for migraine, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. ZOMIG is contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack.\n- Other Vasospasm Reactions\n- Medication Overuse Headache\n- Serotonin Syndrome\n- Increase in Blood Pressure\n- Significant elevations in systemic blood pressure have been reported in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists including patients without a history of hypertension; very rarely, these increases in blood pressure have been associated with serious adverse reactions. In healthy subjects treated with 5 mg of ZOMIG, an increase of 1 and 5 mm Hg in the systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively, was seen. In a study of patients with moderate to severe liver impairment, 7 of 27 patients experienced 20 to 80 mm Hg elevations in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure after a dose of 10 mg of ZOMIG.\n- As with all triptans, blood pressure should be monitored in ZOMIG-treated patients. ZOMIG is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension.\n- Risks in Patients with Phenylketonuria - Phenylalanine can be harmful to patients with phenylketonuria (PKU). ZOMIG-ZMT orally disintegrating tablets contain phenylalanine (a component of aspartame). Each 2.5 mg and 5 mg orally disintegrating tablet contains 2.81 and 5.62 mg of phenylalanine, respectively. ZOMIG tablets do not contain phenylalanine.\n\n【10】 ## Clinical Trials Experience\n- Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.\n- In a long-term, open-label study where patients were allowed to treat multiple migraine attacks for up to 1 year, 8% (167 out of 2,058) withdrew from the trial because of adverse reaction.\n- The most common adverse reactions (≥5% and > placebo) in these trials were neck/throat/jaw pain, dizziness, paresthesia, asthenia, somnolence, warm/cold sensation, nausea, heaviness sensation, and dry mouth.\n5 mg, or 5 mg dose groups in the controlled clinical trials of ZOMIG in patients with migraines (Studies 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5). Only adverse reactions that were at least 2% more frequent in a ZOMIG group compared to the placebo group are included.\n- Less Common Adverse Reactions with ZOMIG Tablets:\n- In the paragraphs that follow, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse clinical reactions are presented. Because the reports include reactions observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of ZOMIG in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse reaction reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse reactions, etc. limit the value of the quantitative frequency estimates provided. Adverse reaction frequencies were calculated as the number of patients who used ZOMIG tablets and reported a reaction divided by the total number of patients exposed to ZOMIG tablets (n=4,027). Reactions were further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: infrequent adverse reactions (those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients) and rare adverse reactions (those occurring in less than 1/1,000 patients).\nInfrequent were allergic reactions.\nInfrequent were arrhythmias, hypertension, and syncope. Rare was tachycardia.\nInfrequent were agitation, anxiety, depression, emotional lability and insomnia; Rare were amnesia, hallucinations, and cerebral ischemia.\n- Adverse Reactions with ZOMIG-ZMT Oral Disintegrating Tablets\n- The adverse reaction profile seen with ZOMIG-ZMT oral disintegrating tablets was similar to that seen with ZOMIG tablets.\n\n【11】 ## Postmarketing Experience\n- The following adverse reactions were identified during post approval use of ZOMIG. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.\n- Hypersensitivity Reactions:\n- As with other 5‑HT1B/1D agonists, there have been reports of anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid, and hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema in patients receiving ZOMIG. ZOMIG is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to ZOMIG.\n\n【12】 #Drug Interactions\n- Ergot-containing Drugs\n- Ergot-containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions. Because these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and ZOMIG within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated.\n- MAO-A Inhibitors\n- MAO-A inhibitors increase the systemic exposure of zolmitriptan and its active N-desmethyl metabolite. Therefore, the use of ZOMIG in patients receiving MAO-A inhibitors is contraindicated.\n- 5-HT1B/1D agonists\n- Concomitant use of other 5-HT1B/1D agonists (including triptans) within 24 hours of ZOMIG treatment is contraindicated because the risk of vasospastic reactions may be additive.\n- Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors\n- Cases of life-threatening serotonin syndrome have been reported during co-administration of triptans and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs).\n- Cimetidine\n- Following administration of cimetidine, the half-life and blood levels of zolmitriptan and its active N-desmethyl metabolite were approximately doubled. If cimetidine and ZOMIG are used concomitantly, limit the maximum single dose of ZOMIG to 2.5 mg, not to exceed 5 mg in any 24-hour period.\n\n【13】 ### Pregnancy\nPregnancy Category (FDA):\n- Pregnancy Category C\n- There are no adequate and well- controlled studies in pregnant women; therefore, ZOMIG should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. In reproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, oral administration of zolmitriptan to pregnant animals resulted in embryolethality and fetal abnormalities (malformations and variations) at clinically relevant exposures.\n- When zolmitriptan was administered to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at oral doses of 100, 400, and 1200 mg/kg/day , an increased incidence of hydronephrosis was found in the offspring. The no-effect dose was associated with a plasma AUC ≈280 times that in humans at the MRHD.\n- Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) Pregnancy Category\nThere is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Zolmitriptan in women who are pregnant.\n\n【14】 ### Labor and Delivery\nThere is no FDA guidance on use of Zolmitriptan during labor and delivery.\n\n【15】 ### Nursing Mothers\n- It is not known whether zolmitriptan is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from ZOMIG, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. In rats, oral dosing with zolmitriptan resulted in levels in milk up to 4 times higher than in plasma.\n\n【16】 ### Pediatric Use\n- The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Therefore, ZOMIG is not recommended for use in patients under 18 years of age.\n- One randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of ZOMIG tablets (2.5, 5 and 10 mg) evaluated 696 pediatric patients (aged 12-17 years) with migraines. This study did not demonstrate the efficacy of ZOMIG compared to placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents. Adverse reactions in the adolescent patients treated with ZOMIG were similar in nature and frequency to those reported in clinical trials in adults treated with ZOMIG. ZOMIG has not been studied in pediatric patients less than 12 years old.\n- In the postmarketing experience with triptans, including ZOMIG, there were no additional adverse reactions seen in pediatric patients that were not seen in adults.\n\n【17】 ### Geriatic Use\n- Clinical studies of ZOMIG did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.\n- A cardiovascular evaluation is recommended for geriatric patients who have other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g. diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of coronary artery disease) prior to receiving ZOMIG, - The pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan were similar in geriatric patients (aged > 65 years) compared to younger patients.\n\n【18】 ### Gender\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Zolmitriptan with respect to specific gender populations.\n\n【19】 ### Race\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Zolmitriptan with respect to specific racial populations.\n\n【20】 ### Renal Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Zolmitriptan in patients with renal impairment.\n\n【21】 ### Hepatic Impairment\n- After oral ZOMIG administration, zolmitriptan blood levels were increased in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment, and significant elevation in blood pressure was observed in some of these patients. Therefore, adjust the ZOMIG dose and administer with caution in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment.\n\n【22】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Zolmitriptan in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n\n【23】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\nThere is no FDA guidance one the use of Zolmitriptan in patients who are immunocompromised.\n\n【24】 ### Administration\n- Oral\n\n【25】 ### Monitoring\nThere is limited information regarding Monitoring of Zolmitriptan in the drug label.\n\n【26】 #IV Compatibility\nThere is limited information regarding IV Compatibility of Zolmitriptan in the drug label.\n\n【27】 ### Signs and Symptoms\n- There is no experience with acute overdose of ZOMIG. Clinical study subjects who received single 50 mg oral doses of ZOMIG commonly experienced sedation.\n\n【28】 ### Management\n- There is no specific antidote to ZOMIG. In cases of severe intoxication, intensive care procedures are recommended, including establishing and maintaining a patent airway, ensuring adequate oxygenation and ventilation, and monitoring and support of the cardiovascular system.\n\n【29】 ## Chronic Overdose\nThere is limited information regarding Chronic Overdose of Zolmitriptan in the drug label.\n\n【30】 ## Mechanism of Action\n- Zolmitriptan binds with high affinity to human recombinant 5-HT1D and 5‑HT1B receptors, and moderate affinity for 5-HT1A receptors. The N-desmethyl metabolite also has high affinity for 5‑HT1B/1D and moderate affinity for 5‑HT1A receptors.\n- Migraines are likely due to local cranial vasodilatation and/or to the release of sensory neuropeptides (vasoactive intestinal peptide, substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide) through nerve endings in the trigeminal system. The therapeutic activity of ZOMIG for the treatment of migraine headache is thought to be due to the agonist effects at the 5‑HT1B/1D receptors on intracranial blood vessels (including the arterio-venous anastomoses) and sensory nerves of the trigeminal system which result in cranial vessel constriction and inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release.\n\n【31】 ## Structure\n- ZOMIG (zolmitriptan) tablets and ZOMIG-ZMT (zolmitriptan) orally disintegrating tablets contain zolmitriptan, which is a selective 5‑hydroxytryptamine1B/1D (5-HT1B/1D) receptor agonist. Zolmitriptan is chemically designated as (S)-4--1H-indol-5-ylmethyl-2-oxazolidinone and has the following chemical structure:\n- The empirical formula is C16H21N3O2, representing a molecular weight of 287.36. Zolmitriptan is a white to almost white powder that is readily soluble in water.\n- ZOMIG tablets are available as 2.5 mg (yellow and functionally-score) and 5 mg (pink, not scored) film coated tablets for oral administration. The film coated tablets contain anhydrous lactose NF, microcrystalline cellulose NF, sodium starch glycolate NF, magnesium stearate NF, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose USP, titanium dioxide USP, polyethylene glycol 400 NF, yellow iron oxide NF (2.5 mg tablet), red iron oxide NF (5 mg tablet), and polyethylene glycol 8000 NF.\n\n【32】 ## Pharmacodynamics\nThere is limited information regarding Pharmacodynamics of Zolmitriptan in the drug label.\n\n【33】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n- Absorption\n- Zolmitriptan is well absorbed after oral administration for both ZOMIG tablets and the ZOMIG-ZMT orally disintegrating tablets. Zolmitriptan displays linear kinetics over the dose range of 2.5 to 50 mg.\n- The AUC and Cmax of zolmitriptan are similar following administration of ZOMIG tablets and ZOMIG-ZMT orally disintegrating tablets, but the Tmax is somewhat later with ZOMIG‑ZMT, with a median Tmax of 3 hours for ZOMIG‑ZMT orally disintegrating tablet compared with 1.5 hours for the ZOMIG tablet. The AUC, Cmax,and Tmax for the active N‑desmethyl metabolite are similar for the two formulations.\n- During a moderate to severe migraine attack, mean AUC0-4 and Cmax for zolmitriptan, dosed as a ZOMIG tablet, were decreased by 40% and 25%, respectively, and mean Tmax was delayed by one‑half hour compared to the same patients during a migraine free period.\n- Food has no significant effect on the bioavailability of zolmitriptan. No accumulation occurred on multiple dosing.\n- Distribution\n- Mean absolute bioavailability is approximately 40%. The mean apparent volume of distribution is 7.0 L/kg. Plasma protein binding of zolmitriptan is 25% over the concentration range of 10- 1000 ng/mL.\n- Metabolism\n- Zolmitriptan is converted to an active N-desmethyl metabolite; the metabolite concentrations are about two-thirds that of zolmitriptan. Because the 5HT1B/1D potency of the metabolite is 2 to 6 times that of the parent compound, the metabolite may contribute a substantial portion of the overall effect after ZOMIG administration.\n- Excretion\n- Total radioactivity recovered in urine and feces was 65% and 30% of the administered dose, respectively. About 8% of the dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged zolmitriptan. Indole acetic acid metabolite accounted for 31% of the dose, followed by N-oxide (7%) and N-desmethyl (4%) metabolites. The indole acetic acid and N-oxide metabolites are inactive.\n- Mean total plasma clearance is 31.5 mL/min/kg, of which one-sixth is renal clearance. The renal clearance is greater than the glomerular filtration rate suggesting renal tubular secretion.\n- Special Populations\n- Hepatic Impairment\n- In patients with severe hepatic impairment, the mean Cmax, Tmax, and AUC0-∞ of zolmitriptan were increased 1.5-fold, 2-fold (2 vs. 4 hours), and 3-fold, respectively, compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. Seven out of 27 patients experienced 20 to 80 mm Hg elevations in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure after a 10 mg ZOMIG dose. Adjust the ZOMIG Dose in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment.\n- Clearance of zolmitriptan was reduced by 25% in patients with severe renal impairment (Clcr ≥ 5 ≤ 25 mL/min) compared to subjects with normal renal function (Clcr > = 70 mL/min); no significant change in clearance was observed in patients with moderate renal impairment (Clcr ≥ 26 ≤ 50 mL/min).\n- Age\n- Zolmitriptan pharmacokinetics in healthy elderly non-migraineur volunteers (age 65–76 years) was similar to those in younger non-migraineur volunteers (age 18 - 39 years).\n- Sex\n- Mean plasma concentrations of zolmitriptan were up to 1.5-fold higher in females than males.\n- Race\n- Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data between Japanese and Caucasians revealed no significant differences.\n- Hypertensive Patients\n- No differences in the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan or its effects on blood pressure were seen in mild to moderate hypertensivevolunteers compared with normotensive controls.\n- Drug Interaction Studies\n- All drug interaction studies were performed in healthy volunteers using a single 10 mg dose of ZOMIG and a single dose of the other drug except where otherwise noted.\n- MAO Inhibitors\n- Following one week of administration of moclobemide (150 mg twice daily), a specific MAO-A inhibitor, there was an increase of about 25% in both Cmax and AUC for zolmitriptan and a 3‑fold increase in the Cmax and AUC of the active N-desmethyl metabolite of zolmitriptan. MAO inhibitors are contraindicated in ZOMIG-treated patients.\n- Selegiline, a selective MAO-B inhibitor, at a dose of 10 mg/day for 1 week, had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan and its metabolite.\n- Cimetidine\n- Following the administration of cimetidine, the half‑life and AUC of zolmitriptan (5 mg dose), and its active metabolite, were approximately doubled.\n- Fluoxetine\n- The pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan, as well as its effect on blood pressure, were unaffected by 4 weeks of pretreatment with oral fluoxetine (20 mg/day).\n- Propranolol\n- Cmax and AUC of zolmitriptan were increased 1.5-fold after one week of dosing with propranolol (160 mg/day). Cmax and AUC of the N-desmethyl metabolite were reduced by 30% and 15%, respectively. There were no changes in blood pressure or pulse rate following administration of propranolol with ZOMIG.\n- Acetaminophen\n- A single 10 mg dose of metoclopramide had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan or its metabolites.\n- Oral Contraceptives\n- Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data across studies indicated that mean Cmax and AUC of zolmitriptan were increased by 30% and 50%, respectively, and Tmax was delayed by one-half hour in women taking oral contraceptives. The effect of ZOMIG on the pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives has not been studied.\n\n【34】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\n- Carcinogenesis - Zolmitriptan was administered to mice and rats at doses up to 400 mg/kg/day. Mice were dosed for 85 weeks (males) and 92 weeks (females); rats were dosed for 101 weeks (males) and 86 weeks (females). There was no evidence of drug-induced tumors in mice at plasma exposures (AUC) up to approximately 700 times that in humans at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 10 mg/day. In rats, there was an increase in the incidence of thyroid follicular cell hyperplasia and thyroid follicular cell adenomas in male rats receiving 400 mg/kg/day. No increase in tumors was observed in rats at 100 mg/kg/day, a dose associated with a plasma AUC approximately 700 times that in humans at the MRHD.\n- Mutagenesis - Zolmitriptan was positive in an in vitro bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay and in an in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes. Zolmitriptan was negative in an in vitro mammalian gene cell mutation (CHO/HGPRT) assay and in oral in vivo mouse micronucleus assays in mouse and rat.\n- Impairment of Fertility\n- Studies of male and female rats administered zolmitriptan prior to and during mating and up to implantation showed no impairment of fertility at oral doses up to 400 mg/kg/day. The plasma exposure (AUC) at this dose was approximately 3000 times that in humans at the MRHD.\n\n【35】 #Clinical Studies\n- The efficacy of ZOMIG tablets in the acute treatment of migraine headaches was demonstrated in five randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (Studies 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5), of which two utilized the 1 mg dose, two utilized the 2.5 mg dose and four utilized the 5 mg dose. In Study 1, patients treated their headaches in a clinic setting. In the other studies, patients treated their headaches as outpatients. In Study 4, patients who had previously used sumatriptan were excluded, whereas in the other studies no such exclusion was applied.\n- Patients enrolled in these 5 studies were predominantly female (82%) and Caucasian (97%) with a mean age of 40 years (range 12-65). Patients were instructed to treat a moderate to severe headache. Headache response, defined as a reduction in headache severity from moderate or severe pain to mild or no pain, was assessed at 1, 2, and, in most studies, 4 hours after dosing. Associated symptoms such as nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia were also assessed. Maintenance of response was assessed for up to 24 hours post-dose. A second dose of ZOMIG tablets or other medication was allowed 2 to 24 hours after the initial treatment for persistent and recurrent headache. The frequency and time to use of these additional treatments were also recorded. In all studies, the effect of ZOMIG was compared to placebo in the treatment of a single migraine attack.\n\n【36】 - In this Kaplan‑Meier plot, the averages displayed are based on pooled data from 3 placebo controlled, outpatient trials. Patients not achieving headache response or taking additional treatment prior to 4 hours were censored at 4 hours.\n- For patients with migraine associated photophobia, phonophobia, and nausea at baseline, there was a decreased incidence of these symptoms following administration of ZOMIG tablets as compared with placebo.\n- Two to 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment, patients were allowed to use additional treatment for pain relief in the form of a second dose of study treatment or other medication\n- The efficacy of ZOMIG was unaffected by presence of aura; duration of headache prior to treatment; relationship to menses; gender, age, or weight of the patient; pre-treatment nausea or concomitant use of common migraine prophylactic drugs.\n- At 2 hours post-dosing, there was a statistically significant greater percentage of patients treated with ZOMIG-ZMT 2.5 mg with a headache response (reduction in headache severity from moderate or severe pain to mild or no headache) compared to patients treated with placebo (63% vs. 22%)\n- In this Kaplan-Meier plot, patients not taking additional treatments were censored at 24 hours. The plot includes both patients who had headache response at 2 hours and those who had no response to the initial dose. Taking another dose of study medication was allowed 2 hours post-dose in Study 6. In contrast to studies of ZOMIG tablets (Studies 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5), Study 6 allowed re-dosing of ZOMIG-ZMT oral disintegrating tablets prior to 4 hours.\n\n【37】 #How Supplied\n- 2.5 mg Tablets - Yellow, biconvex, round, film-coated, functionally-scored tablets containing 2.5 mg of zolmitriptan identified with “ZOMIG” and “2.\n- Store ZOMIG Tablets and ZOMIG‑ZMT Tablets at controlled room temperature, 20‑25ºC (68‑77ºF) .

Other terms used to describe regression in children with autism are autism with regression, autistic regression, setback-type autism, and acquired autistic syndrome.  There is no standard definition for regression, which is a puzzling feature of the disorder.\nApproximately 25–30% of children with autism spectrum disorders stop speaking after beginning to say words, often before the age of two.  After the regression, the child follows the standard pattern of autistic neurological development. The term refers to the appearance that neurological development has reversed; it is actually only the affected developmental skills, rather than the neurology as a whole, that regresses. It is more usual for autistic neurological development to not include such aberrations, with age-appropriate autistic symptoms being clear from birth.\nSkill loss may be quite rapid, or may be slow and preceded by a lengthy period of no skill progression; the loss may be accompanied by reduced social play or increased irritability.  The temporarily acquired skills typically amount to a few words of spoken language, and may include some rudimentary social perception. In some cases a child will go through a period of learning new words at the cost of losing previously acquired words.\nRegression in autism spectrum disorders is well documented; attributing regression to environmental stressors may result in a delay in diagnosis. The apparent onset of regressive autism is surprising and distressing to parents, who often initially suspect severe hearing loss.  The pattern of symptoms naturally leads many to suspect that postnatal environmental factors trigger autism.  In particular, because obvious symptoms start just after children receive multiple vaccinations, such as MMR plus varicella (chickenpox), some people perceive a causal link between vaccination and autism, especially if accompanied by a fever, rash, and rapid skill loss.  Although some controversy remains no link has been found with vaccines.\nOther disorders that involve regression are total blindness from birth,  childhood disintegrative disorder, Rett syndrome and Landau-Kleffner syndrome.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "f1f304b6-87ec-4408-b3c7-f7a101072c83", "title": null, "text": "【0】 Clitoromegaly\n\n【1】 #Overview\nClitoromegaly (or macroclitoris ) is an abnormal enlargement of the clitoris (not to be confused with the normal enlargement of the clitoris seen during sexual arousal).\nAlthough clitoromegaly denotes just a clitoris larger than expected (thus involving some uncertainty about what can be defined as normal), it is commonly seen as a congenital anomaly of the genitalia.\n\n【2】 ## Gross Pathology\nIn Atlas of Human Sex Anatomy  by Dr. Robert Latou Dickinson, the normal clitoris is defined as having a crosswise width of 3 to 4 mm. (0.12 - 0.16 inches) and a lengthwise width of 4 to 5 mm (0.16 - 0.20 inches). On the other hand, in Obstetrics and Gynecology medical literature, a frequent definition of clitoromegaly is when there is a CI of greater than 35 mm2 (0.05 inches2), which is almost twice the size given above for an average sized clitoral hood .\n\n【3】 #Causes\nClitoromegaly is otherwise a rare condition and can be either present by birth or acquired later in life.\nIf present at birth, congenital adrenal hyperplasia can be one of the causes, since in this condition the adrenal gland of the female fetus produces additional androgens and the newborn baby has ambiguous genitalia which are not clearly male or female.\n\n【4】 ## Common Causes\nIn acquired clitoromegaly, the main cause is due to hormonal imbalance affecting the adult women, as in polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) , arrhenoblastoma and Fraser syndrome.\nClitoromegaly may be acquired through use of anabolic steroids or testosterone supplements, both of which can cause enlargement of the clitoris. This occurs in Female to Male Transsexuals (FtM) after a period of hormone replacement therapy.  Like FtM transsexuals, female body-builders who use androgens may also experience enlargement of the clitoris and increases in libido.  Women who use testosterone for therapeutic reasons (treating low libido, averting osteoporosis, as part of an anti-depressant regimen, etc) may also experience some enlargement of the clitoris although the dosages warranted for these conditions is much lower.\nDeliberately induced clitoris enlargement, as form of female genital body modification, is reported to be achieved through testosterone injections directly in the clitoris shaft.\n\n【5】 ## Symptoms\nIn the most pronounced cases, clitoromegaly is a symptom of intersexuality since the large clitoris resembles a penis (the different grade of genital ambiguity is commonly measured by the Prader classification  ranging, in ascending order of masculinisation, from 1: Female external genitalia with clitoromegaly through 5: Pseudo-Phallus looking like normal male external genitalia ).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "a855c297-8fca-44fe-9e92-747cf7b651d9", "title": null, "text": "【0】 Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine\n\n【1】 Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) is a standard for handling, storing, printing, and transmitting information in medical imaging. It includes a file format definition and a network communications protocol. The communication protocol is an application protocol that uses TCP/IP to communicate between systems. DICOM files can be exchanged between two entities that are capable of receiving image and patient data in DICOM format It was developed by the DICOM Standards Committee, whose members  are also partly members of NEMA .\nDICOM enables the integration of scanners, servers, workstations, printers, and network hardware from multiple manufacturers into a picture archiving and communication system. The different devices come with DICOM conformance statements which clearly state the DICOM classes they support. DICOM has been widely adopted by hospitals and is making inroads in smaller applications like dentists' and doctors' offices.\n\n【2】 #Parts of the DICOM Standard\nThe DICOM standard is divided into related but independent parts:\nThe links below are to the 2007 version published in December 2006\n- PS 3.1: Template:PDFlink\n- PS 3.9: Retired (formerly Point-to-Point Communication Support for Message Exchange)\n\n【3】 #History\nDICOM is the third version of a standard developed by American College of Radiology (ACR) and National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA).\nIn the beginning of the 1980s it was almost impossible for anyone other than manufacturers of computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging devices to decode the images that the machines generated. Radiologists wanted to use the images for dose-planning for radiation therapy.\n\n【4】 #DICOM Data Format\nDICOM differs from other data formats in that it groups information into data sets. That means that a file of an X-Ray of a chest, for example, actually contains the patient ID within the file, so that the image can never be separated from this information by mistake.\nA DICOM data object consists of a number of attributes, including items such as name, ID, etc. and also one special attribute containing the image pixel data (i.e. logically, the main object has no \"header\" as such - merely a list of attributes, including the pixel data). A single DICOM object can only contain one attribute containing pixel data. For many modalities, this corresponds to a single image. But note that the attribute may contain multiple \"frames\", allowing storage of cine loops or other multi-frame data. Another example is NM data, where an NM image by definition is a multi-dimensional multi-frame image. In these cases three- or four-dimensinoal data can be encapsulated in a single DICOM object. Pixel data can be compressed using a variety of standards, including JPEG, JPEG Lossless, JPEG 2000, and Run-length encoding (RLE). LZW (zip) compression can be used for the whole data set (not just the pixel data) but this is rarely implemented.\n\n【5】 #DICOM Services\nDICOM consists of many different services, most of which involve transmission of data over a network, and the file format below is a later and relatively minor addition to the standard.\n\n【6】 ## Store\nThe DICOM Store service is used to send images or other persistent objects (structured reports, etc.) to a PACS or workstation.\n\n【7】 ## Storage Commitment\nThe DICOM storage commitment service is used to confirm that an image has been permanently stored by a device (either on redundant disks or on backup media, e.g. burnt to a CD).  The service class user (modality, workstation etc.) uses the confirmation from the service class provider (archive station) to make sure that it is safe to delete the images locally.\n\n【8】 ## Query/Retrieve\nThis enables a workstation to find lists of images or other such objects and then retrieve them from a PACS.\n\n【9】 ## Modality Worklist\n\n【10】 ## Modality Performed Procedure Step\nA complementary service to Modality Worklist, this enables the modality to send a report about a performed examination including data about the images acquired, beginning time, end time, and duration of a study, dose delivered, etc.\nIt helps give the radiology department a more precise handle on resource (acquisition station) use.  Also known as MPPS, this service allows a modality to better coordinate with image storage servers by giving the server a list of objects to send before or while  actually sending such objects.\n\n【11】 ## Printing\nThe DICOM Printing service is used to send images to a DICOM Printer, normally to print an \"X-Ray\" film. There is a standard calibration (defined in DICOM Part 14) to help ensure consistency between various display devices, including hard copy printout.\n\n【12】 ## Off-line Media (DICOM Files)\nThe off-line media files correspond to Part 10 of the DICOM standard. It describes how to store medical imaging information on removable media. Except for the data set containing, for example, an image and demography, it's also mandatory to include the File Meta Information.\nDICOM restricts the filenames on DICOM media to 8 characters (many people wrongly use 8.3, but this is not legal). No information must be extracted from these names (PS10:6.2.3.2). This is a common source of problems with media created by developers who did not read the specifications carefully.

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR A NOISE STANDARD\nThe National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) recommends that employee exposure to noise in the workplace be controlled by requiring compliance with the standard set forth in the following sections. Control of employee exposure to the occupational limits stated and adherence to the precautionary procedures prescribed will improve the protection of the working population from incurring noise induced hearing loss that could impair their abilities to understand everyday speech.\nSuch control and adherence at the workplace is believed sufficiently effective to reduce also the possibility of other forms of occupational Injury and illness related to noise. This standard is amenable to techniques that are valid, reproducible, and presently available\n\n【1】 The provisions of this standard are applicable to occupational noise exposures at places of employment and are intended to apply for all noise even though additional controls may be necessary for certain specific types of noise, such as some impact and impulsive noise. For the purposes of this standard the noise exposure is determined for an 8-hour workday.\n\n【2】 As used in this standard, the term: (a) \"Administrative control\" means any procedure that limits daily exposure to noise by control of the work schedule\n1-1 (c) \"Baseline audiogram\" means an audiogram obtained from an audio metric examination that is preceded by a period of at least 14 hours of quiet.\n(e) \"Audiometer setting\" means a setting on an audiometer corres ponding to a specific combination of hearing level and sound frequency.\n(f) \"Daily Noise Dose\" means that value for D derived from the equation:\nD -£ L + Sl + + £2.\n\n【3】 #Ti T2 Tn\nwhere Cl, C2 . , Cn are the actual durations of exposure for an employee at the various noise levels, Tl, T2, ,\n(g) \"dBA -Slow\" means the unit of measurement of sound level indicated by a sound level meter conforming as a minimum requirement to the American National Standard Specification for Sound Level Meters, ANSI SI.4  Type S2A, when used for A-weighted sound level, slow response.\n(h) \"Engineering control\" means any procedure other than administrative control that reduces the sound level either at the source of the noise or in the hearing zone of the employees.\n(i) \"Hearing level\" means the amount, in decibels, by which the threshold of audibility for an ear differs from a standard audiometric threshold.\n\n【4】 Effective noise level is expressed in units oi dBA-Slow.\n\"Noise exposure\" means a combination of effective noise level and exposure duration.

The lines shall be equally spaced and shall be separated by at least 1/4 inch.\nAdditional graduations are optional. The pen which traces the audiogram shall have a fine point so that the tracing shall not exceed 2 dB in width.\nIt shall be possible to disable the stylus drive 1-7 mechanism so that the stylus can be manually set at the 10-dB graduation lines for calibration purposes.\nThe slewing rate for the audiometer attenuator shall be 6 dB/sec or less except that an initial slewing rate greater than 6 dli/sec is permitted at the beginning of each new test frequency, but only until the second subject response.\n(A) The audiometer shall remain at each required test frequency for 30 seconds (+ 3 seconds).

The \"-10.0\" correction term is to account for possible noise spectrum irregularities and noise leakage which might be caused by long hair, safety glasses, head movement, or various other factors.\n\n【12】 #Let\n3. If the octave band levels of the noise are not known, then the dBA reduction R may be computed simply as R --10 log S -3.0 where S  antilog (-0.1 X Qj) + antilog (-0.1 X Q2)\n- antilog (-0.1 X Q3) + antilog (-0.1 X Q4) + antilog (-0.1 X Q5) + antilog (-0.1 X Q6) + antilog (-0.1 X Q7)\nThis calculation is approximate, and is based upon the assumption that the octave band levels are equal. For most types of noise it will give results close to those obtained by the more accurate method of  above. Set audiometer to 70 dB hearing threshold level and measure sound pressure levels of test tones using an NBS-9A-type coupler, for both earphones and at all test frequencies.\nAt 1000 Hz, for both earphones measure the earphone decibel levels of the audiometer for 10 dB settings in the range 70 to 10 dB hearing threshold level. This measurement may be made acoustically with a 9A coupler, or electrically at the earphone terminals.\nMeasure the test tone frequencies with the audiometer set at 70 dB hearing threshold level, for one earphone only.\nIn making the measurements in  - above the accuracy of the calibrating equipment shall be sufficient to prove that the audiometer is within the tolerances permitted by ANSI S3.6-1969.\nA careful listening test, more extensive than that required in the biological calibration, shall be made in order to ensure that the audiometer displays no evidence of distortion, unwanted sound, or other technical problems.\nGeneral function of the audiometer shall be checked, particularly in the case of a self-recording audiometer.\nAll observed deviations from required performance shall be corrected.\nC. An exhaustive calibration shall be performed at least every five years. This shall include testing at all settings for both earphones.\nThe test results must prove unequivocally that the audiometer meets for the following parameters the specific requirements stated in the applicable sections of ANSI-S.  as noted in parenthesis.\nAccuracy of decibel level settings of test tones (Sections 4.1 .4. 1 and 4.1 .4.3).\nAccuracy of test tone frequencies .\nHarmonic distortion of test tones .\nTone-envelope characteristics, i.e. rise and decay times, overshoot, \"off\" level .\nSound from second earphone .\nSound from test earphone .  ation. In the case of periodic sound pressures, the interval must be an integral number of periods or an interval that is long compared to a period.\n\n【13】 #III-l\nFrequency -The frequency of a function periodic in time is the reciprocal of the primitive period. The unit is the cycle per unit time and must be specified. The unit cycle per second is commonly called Hertz (Hz).\n\n【14】 Noise - Noise is any undesired sound; and, by extension, noise is any unwanted disturbance within a useful frequency band, such as undesired electric waves in a transmission channel or device.  Noise is an erratic, intermittent, or statistically random oscillation. Since the definitions of noise are not mutually exclusive, it is usually necessary to depend upon context for the distinction.\nFor airborne sound, unless specified to the contrary, noise level is the weighted sound pressure level called sound level; the weighting must be indicated.\n\n【15】 Period -The period of a periodic quantity is the smallest increment of the independent variable for which the function repeats Itself.\n\n【16】 #III-2\nPeriodic Quantity -A periodic quantity is an oscillating quantity whose values recur for certain increments of the independent variable.\n\n【17】 #Sound\nSound is an oscillation in pressure, stress, particle displacement, particle velocity, etc. in a medium with internal forces (e.g. elastic, viscous), or the superimposition of such propagated oscilla tions.  Sound is an auditory sensation evoked by the oscillation described above.\nSound Absorption -Sound absorption is the change of sound energy into some other form, usually heat, in passing through a medium or on striking a surface.\nUnless otherwise explicitly stated, it is to be understood that the sound pressure is the effective (rms) sound pressure.\n\n【18】 #Response of the Ear\nIn actuality, the ear does not show equal response to all frequencies, and in fact, it is more sensitive to the middle frequencies than to the low or high ones. Studies have been made which determine the sound pressure levels of simple tones at various frequencies which sound just as loud to an observer as a 1000 Hz tone of a particular SPL The number of each curve, loudness level in phons. is the SPL of the 1000 Hz tone used for comparison in 3 determining the curve.\n\n【19】 #Measurement Scales\nThese equal loudness contours have been taken into account in the standardization of several frequency weighting networks which are included on most sound measuring equipment The A scale corresponds approximately to the 40-phon equal loudness contour, the B-scale corresponds to 70-phons, and the C-scale corresponds to the 100-phon contour. With these weighting networks, which modify sound pressure level to approximate the ear's response, the term to be used is sound level, and the weighting used must always be stated.?'The A-sound level is 36 dB\" or \"86 dBA\" are appropriate ex--5 2 pressions\nThe A scale is commonly used in measuring noise to evaluate its effect on people, and the A-weighted sound level is considered an adequate number to indicate or rate the hazard of a certain noise. Explanation of these measurements is given in Part IV.\n\n【20】 #Correction of Original Baseline Audiograms for Age\nTo determine whether there has been a significant change in an employee's hearing due to noise exposure by comparing an audiogram taken since the original baseline audiogram with that audiogram it la necessary to make a correction for difference in age.\nThe best way to make this correction is to use data from a non-noise exposed group from the same area tested in the same manner as the group under consideration. Quite often this is not possible; therefore, It Is necessary to establish an age correction that can be used universally. The data from these four studies with respect to differences in hearing level from age 20 are quite similar. However, the greater changes apparent\nIn the National Health Survey data at the upper frequencies could be expected because this population was not screened for significant noise exposure.\n\n【21】 #III-6\nThus, to provide a uniform correction, tables B-l and B-2  derived from the NIOSH data, will be used as specified in the standard.\n\n【22】 #Conversion of Octave Band Levels to dBA Levels\nWhen the octave-band sound pressure levels of a noise have been measured it is often desirable to compute the A-weighted sound pressure level from them. This can be done as follows:\n1 corresponding to the frequency of the octave band. This method is quite accurate although it does involve some approximation.\n\n【23】 #Calculation of dBA Reduction R for an Ear Protector\nCalculation of dBA reduction R for ear protectors can be done as follows:\n1 One would then subtract this dBA level from the original dBA level to obtain the dBA reduction.\n\n【24】 #III-7\nHowever, the American National Standard for Measurement of Real-Ear Attenuation of Ear Protectors at Threshold, ANSI Z24. 22 , prescribes pure-tone tests at 125, 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 6000, and 8000 Hz.\nWe shall also assume that the 4000 Hz octave band attenuation level can be obtained by averaging the pure tone attenuation levels at 3000 and 4000 Hz, and that the 8000 Hz octave band attenuation level can be obtained by averaging the pure tone attenuation levels at 6000 and 8000 Hz.\nIt ignores noise in the 31.5 Hz, and 16,000 Hz bands, but these rarely contribute substantially to the dBA level.\nWhen the octave band levels are not known it is assumed that the noise has a uniform \"pink\" spectrum, i.e. equal levels in each octave band.\n\n【25】 #IV. REVIEW OF EFFECTS OF NOISE ON MAN\nExposures to noise levels found at the workplace, particularly in mechanized Industries, are likely to be the most Intense and sustained of any experienced In dally living. As such, they represent the severest form of acoustic insult to man and therein pose the greatest harm to human function. Real or alleged effects of occupational noise exposures include the following:\n-Temporary and permanent losses in hearing sensitivity.\n-Physical and psychological disorders.\n-Interference with speech communications or the reception of other wanted sounds.\n-Disruption of job performance.\nThese different listed effects of noise can be classified in various ways. For example, the first two effects can be treated in the context of health or medical problems owing to their underlying biological basis.\nThat is, noise-induced hearing loss, as will be described later, involves damage to the cell structures of the hearing organ, and physical or psychological disorders due to noise presume alterations in normal physiologic or nervous system responses. In contrast, the remaining two effects, interference with sound reception and performance loss, are deemed annoyance or economic problems since they involve no pathology or physical dysfunction to the organism.\nThe aforementioned noise effects can also be classified as \"auditory\"\nand \"extra-auditory\" in nature. In this regard, hearing loss and speech interference caused by noise are deemed auditory effects since they both involve disturbance to the hearing organ and/or its functional processes.\n\n【26】 #IV-1\nNoise effects on physical and psychological health states ¡md/or performance represent extra-auditory effects in that they extend beyond or are apart from auditory experience per se.\nThe intent of this part is to summarize current knowledge of these various adverse effects of noise as it relates to occupational noise conditions, and to establish their importance relative to needs for noise control in industry.\n\n【27】 #Hearing Loss\nThe ear is the organ structure of the body especially adapted and most responsive to the pressure changes underlying airborne sounds or noise. Anatomically, it is divided into three subdivisions -the outer, middle, and inner ear. Some key structures within these subdivisions are shown in Figures 3 and 4 structures by high level sounds subjects them to shearing forces or other mechanical stresses that may jar them loose from their supporting cells or otherwise damage them.1 Another is that constant intense sound stimula tion forces the hair cell receptors to high metabolic levels that cannot be maintained. As a result, the metabolic processes essential for cellular life become exhausted or poisoned, leading to the death of the cells\n12 involved.\n\n【28】 #IV-3\nSuch losses, when due to noise, may be of a temporary or permanent nature. Temporary hearing loss, more usually called temporary threshold shift or TTS, can be produced by brief exposures to high level sound and shows recovery following a period of time in quiet In this instance an audiogram was taken on the listener just before and at various times after the cessation of the noise exposure.\nDifferences between pre-and post-exposure threshold levels for the specified test frequencies display the amount of TTS induced by the noise.\nTTS is greatest immediately after exposure and progressively diminishes with increasing time in the quiet, reflecting ear recovery from the apparent noise overstimulation .\nAs a general rule, a noise capable of causing significant TTS with brief exposures is probably capable of causing significant permanent losses in hearing, given prolonged or recurrent exposures. In fact, some limited evidence from animal studies suggests the presence of minor hair cell damage even in those ears showing complete recovery from noise-induced temporary threshold shift. 13 In any case, daily exposures to TTS-producing noises for several hours per day for months or years would pose a risk of permanent hearing loss. That is, the ear is not likely to recover completely with recurrent exposures of this type. Rather, only partial recovery may occur IV-4 in due course with new resting thresholds established, poorer than those found at the beginning of the overall noise experience. This residual loss is indicative of permanent hearing damage\nThe TTS component in the losses evident in these hearing data was eliminated by allowing sufficient time after the workshift ended before taking audiograms on the worker group. Deductions have also been made in the hearing levels to remove those hearing changes related to aging (i.e. presbycusis).\nDecreased sensitivity to these high frequency sounds may go unnoticed by the listener since they are relatively unimportant to speech reception. With increasing exposure years, however, the losses grow and also broaden to involve other frequencies which are more critical to speech reception, namely, those in the range 500 to 3,000\nHz. In actuality, in the United States, generally accepted procedures for rating hearing handicap for speech consider losses only at frequencies 500, 1000, and 2000 Hz on the audiogram.^ Controversy centers around the need to include 3000 Hz in these judgments since consonant discrimination may depend on hearing sensitivity for sounds higher than 2000\nWhy high frequency hearing, parti cularly around 4000 Hz, shows most vulnerability to noise is not altogether IV-5 clear. One possible explanation is that the resonant frequency of the ear canal is in region 2000 -5000 Hz which, in effect, adds strength to corres-19 20 ponding frequencies in an incoming noise signal. - Complicating evaluations of hearing loss due to industrial noise are a number of factors. First, hearing sensitivity normally decreases with age, and these losses (presbycusis) are quite similar to those caused by excessive noise, i.e. differentially greater losses at the higher fre- Other causes of hearing loss besides noise and age include use of 23 drugs, illness and disease processes, blows on the head. Special audio metric procedures are sometimes necessary to diagnose a given case of hearing loss in order to determine the likelihood that it may have been caused by excessive noise rather than other agents.\nEven when there is clear audiometric evidence of noise-induced hearing loss, questions may be raised as to whether such damage was produced entirely by workplace noise. It is apparent that off-job noise conditions, particularly in recreation, can pose some risk of hearing change by themselves or can 24 exacerbate the acoustic insult associated with the job situation.\n\n【29】 #IV-6\nWhile indicating the need for close appraisal of audiometric results, the aforementioned complicating factors should not be construed as minimizing the seriousness of noise and hearing loss problems in industry Indeed, the popula tion at risk with regards to noise-induced hearing loss may be greater than any other hazard in the work environment. Audiometric data already col lected on samples of employees in many of the jobs surveyed above for excessive noise show them to have poorer hearing relative to other groups of workers not so exposed. Composite reviews of published occupational  Obviously, the rate and number of such impact sounds constituting an exposure period are also factors in making hazard judgments for these types of sounds.\nNoise and hearing surveys in industry dealing with these types of exposure conditions are just beginning. Most permanent hearing loss data reflooting impulse noise hazards have been based on military studies involving gunfire.\n\n【30】 #IV-9\nPhysical and Psychological Disturbances Aside from hearing loss, noise may trigger changes in cardiovascular, 35 37-39 endocrine, neurologic, and other physiologic functions, - all of which are suggestive of a general stress reaction. These physiologic changes are produced typically by intense sounds of sudden onset, but can also occur under sustained high level or even moderately strong noise conditions.\nWhether repeated noise induced reactions of this type can ultimately degrade one's physical and mental health is still uncertain. For example, the aforementioned physiologic changes tend to subside with recurrent exposures to the same sounds, suggesting adaptation and presumably no health difficulty. These observations, however, may not have been conducted over a sufficiently long time period to judge the possible long-term cost 40 of this adaptation to the health of the organism.\nThere are some reports which show that prolonged exposure to high level noise may lead to physiologic disorders in animals. For example, Anthony and Ackerman reported that guinea pigs presented with intense siren-type noises for fairly long periods of time eventually revealed endocrine and metabolic deficits which reduced their ability to cope with 41 the noise stress.\nAdditional siren exposure here resulted in gastro intestinal ailments, cardiovascular disease and even tissue damage in the kidneys and liver. Reproductive dysfunction and reduced resistance to infectious disease have also been reported in animals subjected to recurrent 42 43 or prolonged high level noise conditions. '\n\n【31】 With regard to human exposures, there are Indications in the foreign literature which suggest that routine exposures to intense industrial noise might lead to chronic physical disturbances. A German study, for example revealed a higher incidence of circulatory and neurologic irregularities among steel workers in noisy jobs as compared with other worker groups in 44 less noisy plant areas.\nNeurological examinations of Italian weavers exposed daily to intense noise showed their reflexes to be hyperactive, and in a few cases, electroencephalography traced a pattern of desynchron-25 ization similar to that seen in personality disorders.\nA study in the Russian literature showed workers in noisy ball-bearing and steel plants to have a relatively greater prevalence of cardiovascular irregularities 45 such as bradycardia.\nComplaints of fatigue, irritability, and social conflicts in many noise exposed workers have also been reported in connection 25 44 with several of the investigations just noted. '\n\n【32】 #IV-11\nConcern may be raised as to whether excessive noise poses any added hazards to persons with preexisting health problems. That is, losses in performance may occur when the noise appears and also when it disappears.\nApparently, change in noise levels is the degrading factor. Of interest here is that sound levels required to cause notable performance changes may exceed hearing conservation limits for routine workday exposure. Thus, noise standards for safeguarding hearing could also offset possible noise 38 effects on job efficiency.\nMore moderate levels of noise may actually benefit task performance relative to quiet conditions. The presence of such noise may provide for a more uniform acoustic background, masking stray sounds which could be otherwise audible in a quiet work area and cause distraction. Also on the positive side, pulsating-type sounds may pace or drive performance and, in effect, reduce fatigue on tasks that are trying. The rhythm component in music may serve this purpose too.^\"- Not all performance capacities suffer equally from the disruptive effects of noise. In fact, noise may aid performance on simple, wellpracticed or repetitive tasks through causing increased arousal in an otherwise boring job. There are indications in fact, that only those tasks which require unremitting attention (e.g. vigilance in machine monitoring, product inspection) or which place extreme mental demands on IV-14 the employee (short-term high-memory loads) may be most vulnerable to the degrading effects of n o i s e .^ In short, tasks which by themselves tax the total capacity of the Individual do not permit any accommodation to noise and consequently show loss. In some Instances, noise seems more Inclined to disturb the quality rather than the quantity of work. That Is, noise might not change work output, but may cause more errors. Along these lines, performance under noise may be subject to worker fluctuations, with periods of poor performance being Interwoven with periods of heightened 56 effort.\nThese performance swings, when averaged across the total work session, may yield little or no overall performance decrement.\nIndividual differences are quite commonly found In investigations of noise effects on performance. Attitudes toward noise are a basic factor in this variance. A recent laboratory study found subjects sensing that they had no control over randomly occurring noise intrusions to perform 57 poorer than those who could terminate such sounds.\nPersonality factors also seem to underlie performance variations in noise. Tense, anxious persons, as defined by personality inventories and certain physiologic indicators, seemed less able to cope with certain laboratory tasks as 58 compared with those who were more relaxed.\nThe importance of attitude factors in noise-performance studies is even more evident in field investigations. For example» morale and egoinvolvement in one's job can override stresses imposed by noise.Other employees dissatisfied with their job situations can use noise as a \"scape goat\" for poor performance. It should be mentioned, too, that through a process of self-selection, only the more noise tolerant employees probably stay at a noisy job. The more noise sensitive persons would remove themselves from these situations. Measures of absenteeism and labor turnover could IV-15 reflect the latter occurrences, but could be difficult to relate causally to noise.\nThe numerous factors that can influence noise effects on performance make for highly qualified conclusions and conservative predictions. Generally speaking, intense sounds» preferably impulsive» and a taxing task performed by a tense person offer the combination of conditions most likely to display a noise-induced decrement in performance.\n\n【33】 #Cumulative Effect\nThis discussion has separately treated different adverse effects of noise that may result from occupational exposures. It is unrealistic, however, to conceive of employees In their everyday job routines experiencing one form of noise disturbance to the exclusion of the others. Indeed, one's daily encounters with workplace noise may degrade hearing, mask reception of desired sounds, heighten emotions and physiologic activity, disrupt con centration , or otherwise hinder job efficiency or safety. The collective impact of these noise effects clearly poses a significant challenge to the employee's health, productivity, and well-being.\nNevertheless, noise levels which meet hearing conservation requirements may also be within limits that do not cause losses in job performance.\n\n【34】 #V. PROCEDURES FOR REDUCING EXPOSURES\nThe information in this part is not an attempt to present exact figures as to how many employees are exposed to hazardous noise levels; rather it substantiates that noise is Indeed a common occupational hazard which could affect a large number of employees. The companies were asked to answer the following question: \"How many of your employeees are located In areas where noise levels are 90 dBA or above?\" When this question was asked in August 1971, the recommended level for an 8-hour exposure limit was still 90 dBA, however, it can be assumed that a greater population is at risk.\nV-l 1. The answers from this question cannot be used to determine how many employees are incurring hazardous noise exposures because information concerned with length of exposure time and the exact level of the exposure is not available.\n2. The 341 plants volunteered this information, and the information is based upon their own noise level evaluations.\n\n【35】 #Many other plants involved in the questionnaire survey could not\n-r did not answer the question.\n4\nThe projected numbers of employees located in areas of noise 90 dBA F.

Construct sound reduction enclosures around equipment or parts of equipment.\n\n【41】 #Isolate Operator\nA. Provide a relatively sound-proof enclosure for the operator or attendant of one or more machines.\n\n【42】 #V-4\nOf the items listed above, the preferred procedures for reducing environmental noise are those which are directed at reducing the noise at its source (Items 1-7). Generally, these procedures have proven to be far more efficient in terms of actual noise reduction than the procedure listed as Item 8 . Furthermore, source noise controls provide protection for both the operators of the equipment as well as workers in the immediate exposure environment.\n\n【43】 #Administrative Controls\nAnother effective approach to reducing the hazard of excessive noise exposure is to limit the dally amount of exposure which each employee receives, by means of strict control of the work schedule.\nThe following are several methods suggested by the Department of Labor \"1. Arrange work schedules so that employees working the major portion of a day at or very close to the criteria limit are not exposed to higher noise levels.\n2. Ensure that employees who have reached the upper limit of duration for a high noise level, work the remainder of the day in an en vironment with a noise level well below criteria limit.\n3. Where the man-hours required for a job exceed the permissible time for one man in one day for the existing sound level, divide the work among two, three, or as many men as are needed, either successively or together, to keep individual noise exposure within permissible time limits.\n4. If less than full-time operation of a noisy machine is needed, arrange to run it a portion of each day, rather than all day for part of the week.\nV-5\nPerform occasional high level noise producing operations at night or at other times when a minimum number of employees will be exposed.\"\nWhen personnel are rotated, extreme care must be taken to insure that no single employee is exposed to a high level noise for a period longer than is allowed by the noise exposure limits.\n\n【44】 #V-6\nVI.\n\n【45】 #DEVELOPMENT OF THE STANDARD\nAttempts at limiting human exposure to noise have been based on damage risk criteria. The purpose of such criteria is to define maximum permissible levels of noise for stated durations which, if not exceeded, would result in an acceptably small effect on hearing levels over a working lifetime of exposure.\nPrevious  1. Measurement of spectral distribution (Noise Spectrum).\n2. Determination of the temporal characteristics of exposure (Noise Duration).\n\n【46】 #Identification of a protection goal (Biologic Response).\n\n【47】 The second major Impetus for measurement of noise based on octave band analysis came from research which indicated that, at least for most audio metric frequencies, the amount of threshold shift observed (either temporary or permanent) was closely related to the frequency or spectrum of the stimulus. Results of \"stimulation deafness\" (temporary threshold shift) studies indicated that for pure tone stimuli the maximum shift in hearing appears to be about one-half octave above the frequency of total Prior to 1956 damage risk criteria set as a goal for protection , the prevention of hearing loss at all frequencies. This necessitated assessment of the noise at each octave band. After this time, VI-3 however, much more qualified protection goals were established (usually pro tection of loss in the so-called \"speech frequencies\") such that only knowledge of the sound pressure in certain critical octave bands (not to\" be confused with aural critical bands) was required In order to assess the risk of noise exposure to hearing. This approach characterized the damage risk criteria developed by the Air Force in 1956, The American Academy of Ophthalmology and Otolaryngology in 1957, the International Standards Organ ization in 1961, and the American Academy of Ophthalmology and Otolaryngology in its revision of the 1957 criteria in 1964 .\nThe procedure for rating noise hazards by this mehtod consists of measuring the octave band levels in the critical octaves, and then comparing the measured levels with damage risk contours. This is best exemplified by the use of the \"Noise Rating\" curves developed by the International 80 Standards Organization.\n\n【48】 #The Use of A-weighted Sound Level\nSince the publishing of the first Intersociety \"Guidelines for Noise 81 Exposure Control,\" a relatively new approach, A-weighted sound level measurement, has become a popular measure for assessing overall noise hazard. As stated in Part III, the weighting on the A-scale approximates the 40-phon equal loudness contour . Use of the A-weighting is thought, therefore, to insure the rating of noises in a reasonably similar manner as would the human ear.\n\n【49】 #VI-4\nSeveral studies have been conducted In order to evaluate the efficacy of using A-weighted sound levels In rating hazardous exposures to noise.\n82 In a study of 580 Industrial noises, Botsford showed that the A-weighted sound level Indicated the hazard to hearing as accurately as did limits expressed as octave band sound pressure levels in 80% of the cases and was slightly more conservative than octave band measures in 16% of the noises. Passchier-Vermeer2^ found that, except In one noise condition, sound level In d BA was as accurate as Nose Rating (NR) in estimating noise 83 induced hearing loss. In a study of hearing loss in 759 subjects, Robinson concluded that the error incurred from using dBA in predicting hearing level was within + 2 dB, even for noises ranging in slope from + 4 dB/ 84 octave to -5 dB/octave. A recent study found that even though dBA perhaps discounted too much low frequency energy, in all cases but one it predicted TTS2 resulting from exposures to noises of different spectra (slopes of -6 dB/octave, 0 dB/octave, and 6 dB/octave) as well as or better than other noise rating schemes which employed spectral measurements in octave-bands.\nAs a result of its simplicity and accuracy in rating hazard to hearing, the A-weighted sound level was adopted as the measure for assessing noise exposure by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienlsts\n\n【50】 #VI-5\nIn keeping with the several precedents which have been established for its use in rating the hazard resulting from industrial noise exposure, and because it has been shown to be a reasonably accurate measure of such hazard, the A-welghted sound level measurement has been recommended for use in rating noise hazard in the Recommended Standard.\n\n【51】 #Protection Goal\nThe limit of noise exposure that is established ultimately depends upon the degree of hearing which is to be protected and the number of persons in an exposed population to be protected. If a very strict protection criterion is contemplated such that no person exposed to noise will develop hearing loss at any frequency, the maximum permissible noise level governing a daily, or near daily, exposure would be quite low. Conversely, if the protection goal were to permit a certain amount of hearing loss in a small percentage of workers over a working lifetime, then the permissible exposure level would be raised accordingly8 and then computing the average over these three frequencies. The major contribution of this formula was the introduction of the concept that hearing loss for speech could be estimated by the average hearing levels at what has now become known as the \"speech frequencies\"-500, 1000, and 2000 Hz.\nThe American Medical Association in 1947 recommended that hearing loss for speech be determined by the pure tone hearing losses at 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz. The four frequencies were given a weighting in accordance with what was presumed to be the importance of each frequency in hearing for speech ,i.e. 15% at 500 Hz, 30% at 1000 Hz, 40% at 2000 Hz, and 15%\nat 4000 H z  . This guideline further suggested that hearing loss for speech does not begin until the weighted average hearing loss equaled 10 dB, and total loss for speech hearing occurred when the loss at 500 Hz reached 90 dB or the losses at the other 3 frequencies reached 95 dB.\nIn a later article which reviewed the assumptions In computing hearing 94 loss for speech, the AM A made the following observations and recommendations:\nEveryday communication should be the basis for evaluation of hearing disability. \"Ideally, hearing impairment should be evaluated in terms of ability to hear everyday speech under everyday conditions. The ability to hear sentences and to repeat them correctly in a quiet environment is taken as satisfactory evidence for correct hearing of everyday speech. Because of present limitation of speech audiometry, the hearing loss for speech is estimated from measurements made with a pure tone audiometer. For this estimate, the simple average of the hearing levels at the 3 frequencies 500, 1000, and 2000 cps is recommended.\nV I -10 \"In order to evaluate the hearing impairment, it must be recognized that the range of impairment is not nearly so wide as the audiometric range of human hearing. Audiometric zero, which is presumably the average normal threshold level is not the point at which Impairment 1. The basis of hearing impairment should be not only the ability to hear speech, but also the ability to understand speech.\n\n【52】 #The ability to hear sentences and repeat them correctly in quiet\nis not satisfactory evidence of adequate hearing for speech communication under everyday conditions. 2 above, the ability to understand speech under everyday conditions is best predicted on the basis of the hearing levels at VI-11 1000, 2000, and 3000 He.\n\n【53】 #From  and ,\nThe point at which the average of hearing losses in the stated three frequency range of 1000 -3000 Hz begins to have a detrimental effect oil the ability to understand speech is 25 dB re ANSI .\nabove, the dbility to \"hear\" speech, measured in terms of the lowest intensity at which a listener can barely identify speech materials, provides little information concerning communication difficulties under everyday con-QQ ditions. As Sataloff states, \"It  implies the presence of obvious difficulties in hearing speech. Actually, the difficulty mofe often lies not so much in 'hearing' speech as in 'understanding' it.\" Furthermore, Davis and S i l v e r m a n^ observed that \". a man with severe high-tone nerve deafness (as is seen in occupational noise induced hearing loss), will always fall to hear certain sounds and will never make a perfect articulation score. On the other hand, the same man may hear some words, the easy low-frequency words, as well as anyone else does. He may have a normal threshold for speech.\"\nThis issue is further clarified if one compares the \"typical\" clinical picture of a person having a conductive hearing loss versus a person having A sensorineural hearing loss resulting from noise exposure. Both cases would be expected to have elevated speech reception thresholds (a measure of hearing for speech); however, in the case of the conductive loss, speech discrimination (measure of understanding) would be approximately the same as that iot a person having normal hearing, provided that the presentation level ift sufficiently above the speech reception threshold level. The person with occupational hearing loss (sensorineural), on the other hand, would have VI-12 relatively poor discrimination scores, and the effect of raising the pre sentation level to higher levels often serves to reduce the articulation 100 score\nIt is apparent, therefore, that the formula applied to compute hearing impairment should consider discrimination ability and that the pure tone frequencies used in the formula should be highly correlated with this latter function.\n\n【54】 100Z. Furthermore, everyday speech rarely takes the form of complete sentence communications; thus, the number of speech cues available for 88 accurate speech perception under everyday conditions is greatly reduced.\nFrom this discussion, it may be concluded that an appropriate predicting scheme for determination of hearing impairment must include some consideration VI-13 for an actual daily communication environment rather than some optimum condition as suggested by the AAOO -AMA.\n2000. and 3000 Hz (point 3 above), results of several studies indicate that hearing levels at these three frequencies predict hearing loss for speech under mild conditions of distortion better than the three frequency average at 500, 1000, and 2000. In chinchillas. However, they cautioned that their findings were only applicable to continous exposures and not to intermittent exposures.\nVariables that are germane to Interrupted exposures but do not play a significant role in limiting hazard from short-term continuous exposures further complicate the problem of how the ear responds and integrates noise over time. One such variable is the \"acoustic\" or \"middle ear\" reflex.\nWhen the ear is exposed to loud noise, the middle ear muscles contract, thus altering the impedance of the middle ear. This reflex, which serves to attenuate the noise reaching the inner ear, adapts out or disappears quickly if the noise is continuous and relatively unchanging over time.\nHowever, if the noise level varies considerably or is interrupted on a regular or irregular basis, then the reflex is sustained.\nA second variable which plays an important role in reducing the hazard of interrupted noises relative to short-term continuous noises concerns the off-time of the exposure cycles. Depending upon the over-all level of the noise and the nature of the relationship between on-time and off-time, a considerable reduction in the degree of temporary hearing threshold shift may be observed.\nTo date, the only empirical data available on permanent hearing losses resulting from intermittent exposures comes from a study of iron ore miners conducted by Sataloff et a l .^^ Their findings indicated that intermittent noises had to be some 15 dB more intense than continuous noises to cause the same additional hearing impairment in men ages 30 to 50 years. Although this 113 VI-18 evidence confirms Che general notion that intermittent exposures are less hazardous than continuous steady-state exposures of the same duration and noise level, the applicability of this rule to other schedules of intermittency must await further investigation.\nSince 1960, several damage risk criteria have been proposed to limit 82,107,115 exposure to intermittent noise.\nFor the most part, these criteria, like the rules for assessing Intermittent noise exposure discussed below, have been based predominantly upon evidence collected from studies of temporary threshold shift.\nAt least three different rules have been proposed in order to assess the hazard of exposures to intermittent noise. The first of these rules, 28 developed by Ward et al.\nwas called the \"on-fraction\" rule. This rule states that the amount of temporary threshold shift resulting from a given intermittent exposure can be determined on the basis of noise level and average on-fractlon (the time the noise is on divided by the total duration of exposure). This procedure assumes that levels below 75 dB SPL are not hazardous to hearing; thus, the amount of on-time is taken as the total time the noise is above 75 dB SPL. In a critical test of the on-fraction rule, Selters and Ward^1 found that this rule was invalid when the regular on-off times exceeded two minutes.\nOne of the crucial assumptions of the \"exposure-equivalent\" rule is that the course of recovery from TTS is Independent of the type of noise 33 that produce the TTS. In a recent article, Ward has presented data that question the validity of this assumption. It appears that intermittent exposure to high level, high frequency noise causes a considerable delay in the recovery of TTS relative to intermittent low frequency exposures.\nAlthough possibly not as scientifically rigorous as the previously mentioned procedures, the \"equivalent continuous\" rule is not constrained by the assumption concerning the regularity of exposure cycles which is basic to the other rules.\n\n【55】 #VI-20\nIntermittent noise exposure criteria based upon the first and/or second rules include those developed by Glorig, Ward, and N i x o n , 113 CHABA 107 82 Working Group 46, and Botsford. Similar limits have been adopted as part of a revision of the German document con-116 cerned with assessment of industrial noise in working areas.\n\n【56】 Considerably more data must be collected to evaluate present criteria which attempt to designate safe levels of exposure to Intermittent noise. on the other hand, suggested that the \"off\" level was frequently dependent. For example, the safe level of exposure for the octave band 300 -600 Hz was seen to be 89 dB SPL, whereas It was approximately 85 dB SPL for octave band 1200 -2400 Hz.\nTwo lines of evidence suggest that the lower limit of Interrupted exposure is considerably below the levels mentioned above. In a review of  XI.\nThe audiometric van used for the hearing tests was capable of testing six individuals at one time. All employees were tested before the beginning of their work shift, and, due to scheduling problems, the number of employees in a test session ranged from one to six. When less than six employees were present at a testing session, an attempt was made to randomize the assign ment of audiometers. It was also necessary to use headphones with otocups to properly shield the employees from the possible effects of interference caused from hearing the other test tones in the van. However, it was found from the results of two independent studies in the NIOSH laboratory that there was no significant difference in measured thresholds between headphones fitted with otocups and those fitted with standard MX-41/Ar type ear cushions.\nBefore data analysis could be done, it was necessary to check the calibration data accumulated during the respective survey. Calibration of the audiometeres used to take the audiograms was usually performed before and after each survey. The data were corrected where necessary to the appropriate values given in the American National Standard Specifications for Audiometers, ANSI S 3 .6 .\nUsed for purposes of data analysis were the three-frequency averages mentioned above In the definitions of hearing impairment. HLI (0.5, 1, 2)\nand HLI\n\n【57】 #VI-25\nThe samples were grouped Into age and experience ranges to assure equal numbers per cell and a consistent spread of the data across the various dBA levels.\nThe following lists the steps made in the data analysis:\n1. Hearing level indices for 87 and 94 dBA noise exposed individuals were grouped into 31 samples for three-way cross-classification with respect to dBA level, age group, and experience group. The data were transformed by taking natural logarithms, and the resulting variances of log HLI (0.5, 1, 2)\nand log HLI  for replicate subjects was stable over all cells defined by the crosa-clasalfication.\n2. Fifth-degrfee orthogonal polynomial regression curves were fitted to log HLI v s . dBA for each age and experience cell using data for all dBA levels. Significance tests for nullity of regression coefficients were performed. For most of the curves which exhibited any significant trend, a straight line fitted the data within the limits of unexplained variability.\n\n【58】 #VI-26\nIn several cases, fourth or fifth degree coefficients showed significance, but examination of the plotted points revealed these to be artifacts due to clustering of the dBA levels for those plots, i.e. too few levels of the independent variable so that the polynomial tended to \"fit the random errors.\"\n3. Histograms of pooled deviations of log HLI values from the respective regression lines for H L I (0.5, 1, 2) and HLI  were constructed by fitting normal distribution curves. Chi-square goodness-of-fit tests were performed. The tests revealed that the log HLI deviations from the means were normally distributed over the full range of variability to a very significant degree of approximation as shown in Figures 14 and 15 Means were found to be zero, and pooled variances were calculated for use in later stages of the analysis.\n4. Regression lines for different age groups within an experiencelevel were tested for parallelism, and in every case, the lines were found to be parallel within the limits of error in the slope estimates. Pooled slopes were calculated, and the intercepts were revised to reflect the small differences between the separate and pooled slopes. Families of parallel lines were plotted. Tests for coincidence of sets of parallel lines were then made by the method of covariance analysis. This revealed significant difference at the 0 .0 1 probability level in all cases.\n5. Regression lines for different experience levels within an age group were not found to be parallel, and, for each age group, the intercepts were compared by means of Student's t-tests. The \"intercepts\" were defined as ordinates of the regression lines at a dBA of 79, which represented the control group exposed to less than 80 dBA. These regression lines were found to be significantly different families of nonparallel lines from common intercepts.\nVI-27 6.\nFor each age and experience combination, the normal distribution of pooled variation in replicate subjects was distributed about the re gression line with its zero mean centered at the ordinate of the line.\nThis model was then used to calculate a predicted percentage of subjects whose hearing levels exceeded a \"fence\". Thus, such percentages could be tabulated as a function of dBA for each age and experience category.\nFurthermore, risk values were then derived as the percentage difference between employees exposed to noise levels 80 dBA or greater and those exposed to less than 80 dBA .\nThis analysis indicates that the 85 dBA-Slow noise limit for an eighthour day, in conjunction with the medical program prescribed in the standard, will improve the protection of the working population from hearing loss that could impair their abilities to understand everyday speech. The reliability of the analysis is evidenced by homogeneity of the variance and normality of the population distributions. In other words, the evaluation is repeatable and is representative of a random sample.  Thus, the Intersociety analysis differs from that of NIOSH in several characteristics: use of one ear only, nonseparation of experience groups, use of SIL in noise levels, and use of a dissimilar composite population.\n\n【59】 Another study whose analysis determined risk is published In ISO 90 Reconmendation R1999 .\nThe lack of otological screening has some effect on incidence of hearing impairment for both the noise exposed and the non-noise exposed groups, but, when risk is calculated by subtracting the two incidences, the effect is essentially cancelled.

MCTD is a systemic autoimmune disease that is characterized by overlapping symptoms of two or more systemic autoimmune diseases (SLE, RA, DM, polymyositis, and scleroderma) and the presence of antibodies against U1snRNP. Primary pathogenesis in MCTD include vasculopathy leading to tissue ischemia, immunological and inflammatory processes and fibrosis caused by excessive synthesis of collagen and other proteins of matrix. In MCTD associated conditions include secondary Sjogren’s syndrome and trigeminal neuralgia An x-ray may be helpful in the diagnosis of complications of MCTD, which include features characteristic of polyarthritis and esophageal dilatation. The treatment of patients with MCTD depends on type of internal organ involvement, phase of the disease, and rate of disease progression. Treatment strategies must follow conventional treatments that are used for similar problems in other rheumatic diseases. Usually the treatment of patients with MCTD include low doses of steroids, NSAIDs, immunosuppressive drugs, and biologic agents. The treatment options in refractory cases or in severe clinical conditions include immunoglobulins, cytotoxic agents, and biologic drugs.\n\n【2】 #Historical Perspective\nMCTD was first defined by Gordon C.Sharp et al. in 1972. It has been the first rheumatic disease syndrome defined by a serologic test. In 1976, Alarcon-Segovia proposed criteria for classifying MCTD among all types of connective tissue diseases. It demonstrates the close association between MCTD and Sjogren's syndrome.\n\n【3】 #Classification\nThere is no established system for the classification of mixed connective tissue disease.\n\n【4】 #Pathophysiology\nMCTD is a systemic autoimmune disease that is characterized by overlapping symptoms of two or more systemic autoimmune diseases (SLE, RA, DM, polymyositis, and scleroderma) and the presence of antibodies against U1snRNP. Primary pathogenesis in MCTD include vasculopathy leading to tissue ischemia, immunological and inflammatory processes and fibrosis caused by excessive synthesis of collagen and other proteins of matrix. In MCTD associated conditions include secondary Sjogren’s syndrome and trigeminal neuralgia\n\n【5】 #Causes\nMixed connective tissue disease is an autoimmune disease and the exact cause is unknown.\n\n【6】 #Differentiating mixed connective tissue disease from Other Diseases\nMCTD has to be differentiated from other conditions with similar presentation of arthritis and rash like systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, rhupus, undifferentiated connective tissue disease, systemic sclerosis, Sjogren's syndrome, vasculitis, Behcet's syndrome, Kikuchi's disease, serum sickness, psoriatic arthritis and human parvovirus B19 infection.\n\n【7】 #Epidemiology and Demographics\nThe incidence of mixed connective tissue disease is approximately 2.7 per 100,000 individuals per year. A nationwide study on MCTD showed the prevalence of mixed connective tissue disease was 2.7 per 100,000 individuals in Japan and 3.8 per 100,000 individuals in Norway. In MCTD, the mortality rate is nearly 10.4% over the period of 13-15 years. It is usually diagnosed during childhood and is more frequent among black and Asian population. The female to male ratio is approximately 10 to 1.\n\n【8】 #Risk Factors\nThere are no established risk factors for mixed connective tissue diease.\n\n【9】 #Screening\nThere is insufficient evidence to recommend routine screening for mixed connective tissue disease.\n\n【10】 #Natural History, Complications, and Prognosis\nIf the patients with mixed connective tissue disease left untreated, approximately 35% of patients may progress to develop lung fibrosis. Common complications of MCTD include polyarthritis, Raynaud's phenomenon, interstitial lung disease, esophageal dysmotility, sclerodactyly, polymyositis, and pulmonary hypertension. Major causes of morbidity in long-term MCTD patients include sclerodactyly, diffuse sclerosis, pulmonary arterial hypertension, and nervous system disease. The presence of pulmonary involvement is associated with worst prognosis and high mortality rate.\n\n【11】 ## Diagnostic Study of Choice\nThe diagnostic criteria of Kasukawa include symptoms common to all the diseases involved, presence of antibodies against the U1snRNP, and selected symptoms typical of each of the particular component diseases separately (systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic sclerosis, polymyositis). The MCTD can be confirmed when there is at least one common symptom, positive antibodies reacting with U1RNP, and at least one symptom from each of the component diseases.\n\n【12】 ## History and Symptoms\nPatients with MCTD may have a positive history of Raynaud’s phenomenon, arthralgia, gastroesophageal reflux, myalgia and dyspnea. Common symptoms of MCTD include swollen fingers (“sausage digits”), diffuse swelling of hands, and dry cough. Less common symptoms include rashes, alopecia, mild fever, fatigue.\n\n【13】 ## Physical Examination\nPhysical examination of patients with MCTD is usually remarkable by clinical features seen in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), dermatomyositis (DM), polymyositis, and scleroderma.\n\n【14】 ## Laboratory Findings\nLaboratory findings consistent with the diagnosis of MCTD include antibodies against the U1RNP, rheumatoid factor (RF), high CRP levels, hypergammaglobulinemia, anemia, leucopenia, circulating immune complexes, and hypocomplementemia.\n\n【15】 ## Electrocardiogram\nThere are no ECG findings associated with MCTD.\n\n【16】 ## X-ray\n\n【17】 ## Echocardiography and Ultrasound\nThere are no ultrasound findings associated with mixed connective tissue disease.\n\n【18】 ## CT scan\nIn MCTD, the tomographic images may show radiographic abnormalities related to interstitial lung disease and the presence of esophageal dilatation\n\n【19】 ## MRI\n\n【20】 ## Other Imaging Findings\nThere are no other imaging findings associated with mixed connective tissue disease.\n\n【21】 ## Other Diagnostic Studies\nPulmonary function test may be helpful in the diagnosis of interstitial lung disease as a complication of MCTD. Findings suggestive of interstitial lung disease include significantly lower DLCO values in the active pulmonary stage and restrictive ventilatory defect (reduction of FEV1 and total lung capacity).\n\n【22】 ## Medical Therapy\nThe treatment of patients with MCTD depends on type of internal organ involvement, phase of the disease, and rate of disease progression. Treatment strategies must follow conventional treatments that are used for similar problems in other rheumatic diseases (SLE, scleroderma, polymyositis). Usually the treatment of patients with MCTD include low doses of steroids, NSAIDs, immunosuppressive drugs, and biologic agents. The treatment options in refractory cases or in severe clinical conditions include immunoglobulins, cytotoxic agents, and biologic drugs.\n\n【23】 ## Surgery\nIn MCTD, surgical options are the alternative for the patients who continue to progress in the disease related complications despite aggressive therapy. The surgical options include procedures like atrial septostomy and lung transplantation.\n\n【24】 ## Primary Prevention\nThere are no established measures for the primary prevention of MCTD.\n\n【25】 ## Secondary Prevention\nIn MCTD effective measures for the secondary prevention of Raynaud's disease include vasodilator therapies (such as calcium channel blockers), preventive approaches like avoidance of cold temperatures, smoking, and sympathomimetic agents and use of warm and protection techniques of fingers.

For infants weigh ing 2,000 grams (no later than age 1 week).\n\n【5】 #Rotavirus (RV) vaccines. (Minimum age: 6 weeks for both RV-1  and RV-5 ). Routine vaccination:\n- Administer a series of RV vaccine to all infants as follows:\n1. If RV-1 is used, administer a 2-dose series at 2 and 4 months o f age.\n3. If any dose in series was RV-5 or vaccine product is unknown for any dose in the series, a total o f 3 doses o f RV vaccine should be administered.\n\n【6】 #Catch-up vaccination:\n- The maximum age for the first dose in the series is 14 weeks, 6 days. - Vaccination should not be initiated for infants aged 15 weeks 0 days or older. - The maximum age for the final dose in the series is 8 months, 0 days. - If RV-1(Rotarix) is administered for the first and second doses, a third dose is not indicated - Administer 2 doses o f MMR vaccine to children aged 12 months and older, before departure from the United States for international travel. The first dose should be administered on or after age 12 months and the second dose at least 4 weeks later.\n\n【7】 #Catch-up vaccination:\n- Ensure that all school-aged children and adolescents have had 2 doses of MMR vaccine; the minimum interval between the 2 doses is 4 weeks. months to all adolescents aged 11-12 years. Either HPV4 or HPV2 may be used for females, and only HPV4 may be used for males. - The vaccine series can be started beginning at age 9 years. - Administer the second dose 1 to 2 months after the first dose and the third dose 6 months after the first dose (at least 24 weeks after the first dose).\n\n【8】 #Catch-up vaccination:\n- Administer the vaccine series to females (either HPV2 or HPV4) and males (HPV4) at age 13 through 18 years if not previously vaccinated. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) annually reviews and updates the adult immunization schedule, which is designed to provide vaccine providers with a summary o f existing ACIP recommendations regarding the routine use o f vaccines for adults  In October 2012, ACIP approved the adult immunization schedule for 2013. This schedule also incorporates changes to vaccine recommendations voted on by ACIP at its October 24-25, 2012 meeting.\n\n【9】 #Additional Vaccine Information\nThe primary updates include adding information for the first time on the use o f 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) and the timing of administration ofPCV13 relative to the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) in adults . PCV13 is recommended for adults aged 19 years and older with immunocompromising conditions (including chronic renal failure and nephrotic syndrome), functional or anatomic asplenia, cerebrospinal fluid leaks, or cochlear implants. The schedule also clarifies which adults need 1 or 2 doses of PPSV23 before age 65 years. O ther changes to the PPSV23 footnote include adding information regarding recommendations for vaccination when vaccination status is unknown.\nFor tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine, recom m endations have been expanded to include routine vaccination o f adults aged 65 years and older and for pregnant women to receive Tdap vaccine with each pregnancy. T he ideal tim ing o f Tdap vaccination during pregnancy is during 27-36 weeks' gestation. This recom m endation was made to increase the likelihood o f optimal protection for the pregnant woman and her infant during the first few m onths of the infant's life, when the child is too young for vaccination but at highest risk for severe illness and death from pertussis .\nM anufacturers o f the live, attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) have obtained Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for a quadrivalent influenza vaccine that contains one influenza A (H 3N 2), one influenza A (H 1N 1) and two influenza B vaccine virus strains, one from each lineage o f circulating influenza B viruses. In approxim ately h alf of the recent influenza seasons, the trivalent influenza vaccine has included an influenza B vaccine virus from the lineage different from the predom inant circulating influenza B strains . Inclusion o f both lineages o f influenza B virus is intended to increase the likelihood that the vaccine provides cross reactive antibody against a higher proportion o f circulating influenza B viruses. For LAIV, beginning with the 2013-14 season, it is expected that only the quadrivalent formulation will be available and manufacture o f the trivalent formulation will cease. It is possible that quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine formulations might be available for the 2013-14 season as well. Because a mix o f quadrivalent and trivalent influenza vaccines might be available in 2013-14, the abbreviation for inactivated influenza vaccine has been changed from trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) to inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV). T he abbreviation for LAIV remains unchanged.\nM inor wording changes, clarifications, or simplifications have been made to footnotes for measles, m um ps, rubella vaccine (MMR), hum an papillomavirus vaccine (HPV), zoster vaccine, and hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccines Persons born before 1957 are considered im mune, and routine vaccination is not recommended. Considerations for the possible use of M M R vaccine in outbreak situations are included in the 2011 M M W R publication on vaccination o f health-care personnel  This vaccine is indicated for men who have sex with men if they have another risk factor (e.g. age or underlying condition); the bar has been changed from yellow to purple to more accurately reflect the recommendation.\nVaccine providers are reminded to consult the full ACIP vaccine recommendations if they have questions and to bear in m ind that additional updates might be made for specific vaccines during the year between updates to the adult schedule.\n\n【10】 #Footnotes\n- Inform ation was added to footnote\n\n【11】 # to direct readers to additional inform ation regarding recommendations for vaccination when vaccination status is unknown. - T he influenza vaccination footnote  now uses the abbreviation IIV for inactivated influenza vaccine and drops the abbreviation T IV for trivalent inactivated vaccine (TIV). For the 2013-14 influenza season, it is expected that the LAIV will be available only in a quadrivalent formulation; IIV might be available in both trivalent and quadrivalent formulations. - The tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis (Td/Tdap) vaccination footnote  is updated to include the recommendation to vaccinate pregnant women with Tdap during each pregnancy, regardless of the interval since prior Td/Tdap vaccination and to include the recommendation for all other adults, including persons aged 65 years and older, to receive 1 dose of Tdap vaccine.\n- T he varicella  and H PV  footnotes were simplified; no changes in recommendations were made. Additional inform ation was added to the H P V footnote regarding H PV vaccination and pregnancy. - T he zoster footnote  was changed to clarify that ACIP recommends vaccination o f persons beginning at age 60 years both for persons with and w ithout underlying health conditions for whom the vaccine is not contraindicated. - The measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine footnote  was modified to reflect the new recommendation that a provider diagnosis of measles, mumps, or rubella is not considered acceptable evidence of immunity. Previously, a provider diagnosis of measles or mumps, but not rubella, was considered acceptable evidence of immunity. - Inform ation was added to the pneumococcal polysaccharide (PPSV23) vaccination footnote  and PPSV23 revaccination footnote  to clarify that persons with certain medical conditions are recommended to receive 2 doses o f PPSV23 before age 65 years. In addition, even those who receive 2 doses of PPSV23 before age 65 years are recommended to receive PPSV23 at age 65 years, as long as it has been 5 years since the most recent dose. T he PPSV23 footnote refers to footnote\n\n【12】 #0 for pneumococcal conjugate 13-valent vaccine (PCV13) regarding the timing of PCV13 vaccine relative to PPSV23 for those persons recommended to be vaccinated with both pneumococcal vaccines. - A new footnote  was added for PCV13 vaccine.\nThis vaccine is recommended for adults aged 19 years and older with im m unocomprom ising conditions (including chronic renal failure and nephrotic syndrome), functional or anatomic asplenia, cerebrospinal fluid leaks, or cochlear implants. Those not previously vaccinated with PCV13 or PPSV23 should receive a single dose o f PCV13, followed by a dose o f PPSV23 at least 8 weeks later. Those previously vaccinated with PPSV23 should be vaccinated with PCV13 one year or more after PPSV23 vaccination . - The hepatitis A vaccine footnote  was updated to clarify that vaccination is recommended for persons with a history o f either injection or noninjection illicit drug use.\n- The hepatitis B vaccine footnote  includes minor wording changes and adds information on the vaccine schedule for hepatitis B vaccine series for the Recombivax HB vaccine. The dosing schedules for other hepatitis B vaccines were included in prior years' schedules.\n\n【13】 #Figures\n- T he bar for M M R vaccine for persons born before 1957 has been removed. M M R vaccine is not recommended routinely for persons born before 1957. Considerations for vaccination in measles or mumps outbreak settings are discussed in the ACIP recommendations for health care personnel .\n- A new row for PCV13 vaccine has been added.\n\n【14】 - T he inactivated influenza vaccine precautions were updated to indicate that persons who experience only hives with exposure to eggs should receive IIV rather than LAIV.\n- Pregnancy was removed as a precaution for hepatitis A vaccine. This is an inactivated vaccine, and similar to hepatitis B vaccines, is recommended if another high risk condition or other indication is present. - Language was clarified regarding the precaution for use o f antiviral medications and vaccination with varicella or zoster vaccines.\n\n【15】 #ACIP Adult Immunization Work Group\nWork\n\n【16】 #Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination\n- Two vaccines are licensed for use in females, bivalent HPV vaccine (HPV2) and quadrivalent HPV vaccine (HPV4), and one HPV vaccine for use in males (HPV4). - For females, either HPV4 or HPV2 is recommended in a 3-dose series for routine vaccination at age 11 or 12 years, and for those aged 13 through 26 years, if not previously vaccinated. - For males, HPV4 is recommended in a 3-dose series for routine vaccination at age 11 or 12 years, and for those aged 13 through 21 years, if not previ ously vaccinated. Males aged 22 through 26 years may be vaccinated. - HPV4 is recommended for men who have sex with men (MSM) through age 26 years for those who did not get any or all doses when they were younger. - Vaccination is recommended for immunocompromised persons (including those with HIV infection) through age 26 years for those who did not get any or all doses when they were younger. - A complete series for either HPV4 or HPV2 consists o f 3 doses. The second dose should be administered 1-2 months after the first dose; the third dose should be administered 6 months after the first dose (at least 24 weeks after the first dose). - HPV vaccines are not recommended for use in pregnant women. However, pregnancy testing is not needed before vaccination. If a woman is found to be pregnant after initiating the vaccination series, no intervention is needed; the remainder o f the 3-dose series should be delayed until completion o f pregnancy. - Although HPV vaccination is not specifically recommended for health-care personnel (HCP) based on their occupation, HCP should receive the HPV vaccine as recommended .\n\n【17】 #Zoster vaccination\n- A single dose o f zoster vaccine is recommended for adults aged 60 years and older regardless o f whether they report a prior episode o f herpes zoster.\nAlthough the vaccine is licensed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use among and can be administered to persons aged 50 years and older, ACIP recommends that vaccination begins at age 60 years. - Persons aged 60 years and older with chronic medical conditions may be vaccinated unless their condition constitutes a contraindication, such as pregnancy or severe immunodeficiency. - Although zoster vaccination is not specifically recommended for HCP, they should receive the vaccine if they are in the recommended age group.\n\n【18】 #Measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccination\n- Adults born before 1957 generally are considered immune to measles and mumps. dose should be administered 1 month after the first dose; the third dose should be given at least 2 months after the second dose (and at least 4 months after the first dose).

This species of yeast is non-dimorphic and there has been no observed mating activity.  Until recently, C. glabrata was thought to be a primarily non-pathogenic organism.  However, with the ever increasing population of immunocompromised individuals, trends have shown C. glabrata to be a highly opportunistic pathogen of the urogenital tract, and of the bloodstream (Candidemia).  It is especially prevalent in HIV positive people, and the elderly.\nThere are two widely cited potential virulence factors that contribute to the pathogenicity of C. glabrata.  The first is a series of adhesins coded by the EPA (epithelial adhesin) genes.  These genes, located in the subtelomeric region, can respond to environmental cues that allow them to be expressed en masse so the organism can adhere to biotic and abiotic surfaces in microbial mats.  This is also the suspected mechanism by which C. glabrata forms microbial \"biofilms\" on urinary catheters, and less commonly in-dwelling IV catheters.  It also causes problems with dental devices, such as dentures.  However, the formation of biofilms is very weak as compared to Candida albicans.\nAnother virulence factor that C. glabrata possesses is a wide-spectrum resistance to azole drugs, which are the most commonly prescribed antifungal (antimycotic) drugs.  These drugs, including fluconazole and ketoconazole, are quite useless against C. glabrata.  While some have said that the organism possesses an \"innate\" immunity to the drugs, it is more accurate to say that the organism possesses an evolved resistance to the drugs.  It is still highly vulnerable to polyene drugs such as amphotericin B and nystatin, along with variable vulnerability to flucytosine and caspofungin.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

To access information about this gene, use the \"Home - Gene - NCBI\" external link and enter \"1\", without the quotes, or the number one after the \"/\". The official name of this gene is \"alpha-1-B glycoprotein\". The protein encoded by this gene is a plasma glycoprotein of unknown function. The protein shows sequence similarity to the variable regions of some immunoglobulin supergene family member proteins.\nTranscription of eukaryotic genes is believed to be reasonably well understood. Not all the facts are known but phenomenology is probably complete. Each possibility to cause a simple computer program to transcribe the gene for A1BG is to be tested.\nMost undergraduate university courses describe transcription, so many of the terms used here to analyze the transcription should be reasonably understood. Some usage of state-of-the-art refereed journal articles is included.\nAlthough there are computer programs being used to predict the effects of gene expression, up-regulation or down-regulation, most of these are quite advanced and are not readily available for students or researchers outside specific universities or companies performing drug research and testing.\nJust about any student with access to a computer in various forms is able to write small programs in a variety of computer languages to test for themselves whether or not a specific algorithm works to transcribe this gene.\nThe transcription start site for A1BG has probably been discovered through the use of reverse transcriptase. The publication demonstrating this has been found. Further, the product of the gene has been detected, but exactly how the product has its messenger RNA initially transcripted is unspecified and perhaps unknown.\n\n【1】 #Notations\nNotation: let the symbol / replace or.\nFor example, (A or C or G) becomes (A/C/G).\n\n【2】 #Control groups\nFor the transcription of A1BG, a control group would likely have a DNA segment that contains at least one transcription start site, e.g. G/A/T-G/C+1-G-T/C-G-G-G/A-A-G/C. This segment directs the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme complex to the exact TSS.\nIn terms of a promoter, this transcription by definition should occur in either the core promoter or the proximal promoter. If not fully understood, the TSS may occur in either a focused promoter or a dispersed promoter.\nA transcriptional characteristic of a promoter element may be to be located between -8 and +2 relative to at least one TSS.\nEach promoter element may be found in at least one gene or isoform.\n\n【3】 #Genomes\nThe gene is overlapped by a non-coding RNA (NCRNA00181), and has nearby genes ZSCAN22 at the 5' end and ZNF497 (GeneID: 162968) at the 3' end.

The injected saline volume corresponded to approximately 8–9% of the rats’ body weight and the injection was completed in < 15 s. After 20-h transfection, the animals were decapitated and the liver excised. Samples were prepared by homogenizing 400 μg liver in 2 ml passive lysis buffer (Promega) using a glass teflon homogenizer. The homogenates were centrifuged for 5 min at 12 000 g and 4 °C, and the supernatants were stored at −70 °C.\"\n\"The template for the footprint was obtained by PCR amplification of the rat a1bg sequence from −199 to +29 using the 5′ primer GATCTCAGCTCTGGTGCATGCT and the 3′ primer used for subcloning of the a1bg promoter following genome walking. The 5′ oligonucleotide was end-labelled with γ-32P ATP (Amersham) using T4 polynucleotide kinase and purified with QiaQuick nucleotide Purification Kit (Qiagen) prior to the PCR. The 5′ primer was furnished with an extra G-nucleotide at the 5′ end in order to improve the end-labelling. For the binding reactions 2, 5 and 10 μg nuclear protein extract from female rats were mixed with 1 μg poly(dI-dC), 25 μg BSA and 150 000 c.p.m. of labelled template in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris pH 8, 10 mM MgCl2, 40 mM KCl and 0.2 mM EDTA . The binding reactions were incubated on ice for 45 min followed by DNase I treatment (no. 104132, Roche Diagnostics) for 2 min at room temperature. The concentrations of DNase I were 0.6 and 0.3 ng/μl for samples with and without nuclear extracts respectively. To terminate the digestion, 1 vol. of buffer (0.06 M EDTA, 0.4 M ammonium acetate and 12.5 μg/ml ssDNA) was added after which the reactions were phenol/chloroform extracted and precipitated.

Closer inspection revealed that serine protease granzyme A, alpha-1-B-glycoprotein (A1BG) and the T4 surface glycoprotein precursor (TSGP) were among the up-regulated proteins in DEW and SP. Significant changes in serine proteases, glycoproteins and proto-oncogenes may be associated with the response to cytotoxicity and infectious pathogens by activation of T cells, positive regulation of extracellular matrix structural constituents and immune response, and fibroblast proliferation.\"\n\"A1BG was reportedly involved in a number of diseases such as endometrial cancer, cervical cancer and cervical squamous cell carcinoma , and was also elevated in hepatic fibrosis patients, which allowed such patients to be easily distinguished from HI .\"\n\"Up-regulation of both A1BG and TSGP in DEW indicated that these proteins may be involved in the early regulation of fibrosis in the lung and may be potentially useful for diagnosis factors.\"\n\"The present study investigated five sera samples from females who were Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) 16+ and who had been histopathologically diagnosed with CIN III, as well as five sera samples from healthy control females who were HPV-negative. Protein separation was performed using two-dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis and the proteins were stained with Colloidal Coommassie Blue. Quantitative analysis was performed using ImageMaster 2D Platinum 6.0 software. Peptide sequence identification was performed using a nano-LC ESIMS/MS system.

The eight highest score spots that were found to be overexpressed in the CIN III sera group were identified as α-1-B glycoprotein (A1BG), complement component 3 (C3), a pro-apolipoprotein, two apolipoproteins and three haptoglobins. Only A1BG and C3 were validated using western blot analysis, and the bands were compared between the two groups using densitometry analysis.

The complex dissociated during SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. An opossum liver cDNA library was immunoscreened, and clones containing cDNA encoding for part of the open reading frame for oprin were isolated. The cDNA inserts contained nucleotide sequences corresponding to two internal amino acid sequences of oprin which had been separately determined by protein sequence analysis. Protein database screening using a 211 amino acid sequence deduced from one of the cDNA inserts showed no significant homology to known proteinase inhibitors. There was, however, a 36% identity with human alpha 1B-glycoprotein, a plasma protein of unknown function related to the immunoglobulin supergene family. In addition, the amino-terminal sequence of oprin showed 46% identity with human alpha 1B-glycoprotein in a 26 amino acid residue overlap.\"\n\"DM64 is an acidic protein showing 15% glycosylation and with a molecular mass of 63 659 Da when analysed by MALDI-TOF MS.

The human genome is made up of about 3 billion “letters” along strands that make up the familiar double helix structure of DNA. Particular sequences of these letters form genes, which tell cells how to make proteins. People have about 20,000 genes, but the vast majority of DNA lies outside of genes, t least three-quarters of the genome is involved in making RNA  it appears to help regulate gene activity.\"\nThere are \"more than 4 million sites where proteins bind to DNA to regulate genetic function, sort of like a switch.\"\nOver 50% of human DNA consists of non-coding repetitive sequences.\nSome DNA sequences may encode functional non-coding RNA molecules, which are involved in the regulation of gene expression.\nAbout 2700 formerly active genes are now pseudogenes. Additional DNA is used in introns and for centromeres and telomeres.\n\n【14】 ## Single-nucleotide polymorphisms\n\"Hypertension is the most common chronic disease in the United States, affecting approximately one third of the adult population, and is a major risk factor for acute myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, heart failure, and renal failure.1 Numerous antihypertensive drugs are considered appropriate first-line therapy to lower blood pressure (BP), including diuretics, β-blockers (βB), calcium channel blockers (CCB), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers. These drugs are ultimately prescribed to prevent the long-term cardiovascular complications of hypertension.2 However, there is great interpatient variability in antihypertensive drug response, with only ≈50% of patients achieving an adequate BP response to any 1 drug,3 and limited data are available to guide treatment selection. Why patients respond differently to the same drug and why some patients experience adverse cardiovascular outcomes, despite BP control, while others do not, remains poorly understood. Pharmacogenomics aims to identify genetic markers that are associated with drug response, outcomes, and adverse events.\"\nA nonsynonymous (ns) single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) \"rs893184, located in A1BG ,α-1-B glycoprotein; white interaction P=0.0248, Hispanic interaction P=0.0310, and combined interaction P=0 rs893184 causes a histidine (His) to arginine (Arg) substitution at amino acid position 52 in A1BG. His carriers had a lower risk for the  PO in the  CCB strategy in whites and Hispanics, whereas Arg/Arg patients had a higher risk for the PO in the CCB strategy.\"\n\"The α-1-B glycoprotein precursor (A1BG) is also located at 19q13.4 (6.85 Mb away from SIGLEC12) and encodes a plasma glycoprotein with unknown function. The A1BG protein is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and has been shown to form a complex with cysteine-rich secretory protein 3, a protein present in neutrophilic granulocytes that is thought to play a role in innate immunity.15\"\n\n【15】 ## Alleles\nDef. one of a number of alternative forms of the same gene occupying a given position on a chromosome is called an allele.\n\"The distribution of plasma α1B-glycoprotein (A1BG) was determined by a two-dimensional electrophoresis (agarose-polyacrylamide gel) followed by protein staining in a group of 1099 individuals from 11 populations of the Indian subcontinent. The sample comprised 454 from several tribes of Arunachal Pradesh; 76 Bengali Hindus and 88 Bengali Muslims; 179 Tamil Hindus from Singapore and 107 from India; 81 Tamil Muslims, 48 Sinhalese from Sri Lanka and 66 North Indians. Three common A1BG phenotypes (1–1, 1–2 and 2–2) were observed in this study. One each of a new allele (A1BG*7) in heterozygous form (1–7) was detected respectively among Tamil Hindus of India and Singapore. The phenotypic distribution of A1BG alleles was at Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in all the populations. The frequency of A1BG*2 was in general lower in the Mongoloid tribes of Arunachal Pradesh (0·043–0·104) and North Indians (0·068) compared to that in other Indian populations (0·130–0·171) and Sinhalese (0·208).\"\n\n【16】 #Epigenomes\nInside each eukaryote nucleus is genetic material (DNA) surrounded by protective and regulatory proteins. These protective and regulatory proteins and the dynamic changes to them that occur during the course of a eukaryote's existence are the epigenome.\nThere are \"nearly 50,000 acetylated sites  in the human genome that correlate with active transcription start sites and CpG islands and tend to cluster within gene-rich loci.\"\nAny of the epigenome sites may be influenced during or before transcription to modify gene expressions.\n\n【17】 #Alternate sites\nAlternate transcription start sites may be needed. These include those on the coding strand, from the opposite direction (other end of the gene) on the same strand, additional start sites of isoforms, other start sites for the same product, ncRNA or miscRNA start sites within the gene, and pseudogenes.\nTo induce the transcription mechanism to relocate to an alternate site, a modification to a transcription factor may be required.\n\n【18】 ## Strand transfers\nThese two genes produce versions of integrase which appear to facilitate strand transfer from the coding strand to the template strand using a retrotransposon:\n- GeneID: 54826 GIN1 gypsy retrotransposon integrase 1 and - GeneID: 57523 NYNRN NYN domain and retroviral integrase containing.\n\"The human testis Rad51 protein, a structural homolog of E. coli RecA, binds single- and double-stranded DNA and exhibits DNA-dependent ATPase activity.  hRad51 promotes homologous pairing and strand exchange reactions in vitro.\nMutational \"asymmetry has acted over long periods of time to produce a compositional asymmetry, an excess of G+T over A+C on the coding strand, in most genes .\"\n\n【19】 #Double strand transcriptions\nHowever, in plants, most siRNAs are generated by RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.\nSingle strand RNA transcripts: ssRNA. RNA interference requires that two base pair-complementary strands of RNA to come together to form double stranded RNA.\n\n【20】 #Gene transcriptions\nThe detection of the gene product presumes that transcription occurs and may suffice as proof of concept.\nDef. \"the factors, including RNA polymerase II itself, that are minimally essential for transcription in vitro from an isolated core promoter\" are called the basal transcription machinery.\nRNA polymerase II holoenzyme complex finds and uses the transcription start site.\nOnce the DNA double helix and its associated epigenome have been melted so that the template strand is available for binding, a transcription factor binds to a specific nucleotide sequence to biochemically influence gene transcription.\n\n【21】 #Immunoglobulin domains\nThe immunoglobulin domain is a type of protein domain that consists of a 2-layer sandwich of between 7 and 9 antiparallel β-strands arranged in two β-sheets with a Greek key topology.\n\n【22】 #Angiotensin-converting enzyme\nThe angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) is involved in catalyzing the conversion of angiotensin I into a physiologically active peptide angiotensin II and has a testicular form variant .\nACE plays a key role in the renin-angiotensin system.\n\"CRISP proteins have been shown to be involved in various functions related to sperm–oocyte fusion, innate host defense function and ion channel blockage.\"\n\"Multiple members of the CRISP family have been identified in the mammalian male genital tract (CRISP1, CRISP2 and CRISP3).\"\n\"here is evidence that prostate cancer patients with higher levels of CRISP3 have a smaller probability of recurrence-free outcomes .\"\n\n【23】 #A1BG-CRISP3\nThe human cysteine-rich secretory protein (CRISP3) \"is present in exocrine secretions and in secretory granules of neutrophilic granulocytes and is believed to play a role in innate immunity.\" CRISP3 has a relatively high content in human plasma.\n\"The A1BG-CRISP-3 complex is noncovalent with a 1:1 stoichiometry and is held together by strong electrostatic forces.\" \"Similar  between toxins from snake venom and A1BG-like plasma proteins . inhibits the toxic effect of snake venom metalloproteinases or myotoxins and protects the animal from envenomation.\"\nOpossums  have a remarkably robust immune system, and show partial or total immunity to the venom of rattlesnakes,  cottonmouths, and other  pit vipers.\n\"Crisp3  mainly  in the salivary glands, pancreas, and prostate.\" \"CRISP3 is highly expressed in the human cauda epididymidis and ampulla of vas deferens .\"\n\n【24】 #Genomic product\n\n【25】 When A1BG is transcribed by the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme, the pre-mRNA (messenger RNA, mRNA) consists of eight exons and seven introns which are spliced to yield the final mRNA. A1BG is a minus strand transcription. The included nucleotides as numbered in the human genome go from 3'-58858172 to 58864864-5' inclusive and are so transcribed. When the mRNA template 5'-58858172 to 58864864-3' is used to create the protein, the translation proceeds 3'-58864864 to 58858172-5' rather than 5'-58858172 to 58864864-3'.\n\n【26】 #Strands\nEukaryotes have a double helix of DNA surrounded by an epigenome.\nA single strand of DNA  if an RNA version of the same sequence is translated or translatable into protein. Its complementary strand is called antisense (or negative (-) sense).\nThe two complementary strands of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) are usually differentiated as the \"sense\" strand and the \"antisense\" strand. The DNA antisense strand serves as the source for the protein code, because, with bases complementary to the DNA sense strand, it is used as a template for the mRNA.\nThe only real biological information that is important for labeling strands is the location of the 5' phosphate group and the 3' hydroxyl group because these ends determine the direction of transcription and translation.\nFrom a molecular point of view, a transcription complex may not have an obvious way to choose the \"antisense\" strand from the \"sense\" strand. It also may not have an obvious way to chose the direction of transcription once a strand has been chosen as the \"antisense\" strand.\nTo choose which strand, then which direction, may require chemical cues. A1BG has two sections of nucleotides between itself and neighboring genes:\n- between ZSCAN22 and A1BG and - decondensation of the locus, - nucleosome remodeling, - histone modifications, - binding of transcriptional activators and coactivators to enhancers and promoters, and - recruitment of the basal transcription machinery to the core promoter.\"\n\n【27】 #Preinitiation complexes\n\"A stable preinitiation complex can form in vitro on TATA-dependent core promoters by association of the basal factors in the following order: TFIID/TFIIA, TFIIB, RNA polymerase II/TFIIF, TFIIE, and then TFIIH.\"\n\n【28】 #Promoters\nThe A1BG promoter is a region of the DNA adjacent to the gene itself that facilitates gene transcription. Within the overall promoter are response elements which provide a secure initial binding site for the RNA polyermase II holoenzyme.\nPositions in the promoter are designated relative to the transcription start site (N+1, TSS), with positions upstream having negative numbers counting back from -1 away from the TSS, for example, -100 is 100 nucleotides (nts) before 3'-58858172 (specifically pre-3' at 58858072).\n\n【29】 #Focused promoters\n\"In focused transcription, there is either a single major transcription start site or several start sites within a narrow region of several nucleotides. Focused transcription is the predominant mode of transcription in simpler organisms.\"\n\"Focused transcription initiation occurs in all organisms, and appears to be the predominant or exclusive mode of transcription in simpler organisms.\"\n\"In vertebrates, focused transcription tends to be associated with regulated promoters\".\n\"The analysis of focused core promoters has led to the discovery of sequence motifs such as the TATA box, BREu (upstream TFIIBrecognition element), Inr (initiator), MTE (motif ten element), DPE (downstream promoter element), DCE (downstream core element), and XCPE1 (Xcore promoter element 1) .\"\n\n【30】 #Dispersed promoters\n\"In dispersed transcription, there are several weak transcription start sites over a broad region of about 50 to 100 nucleotides. Dispersed transcription is the most common mode of transcription in vertebrates. For instance, dispersed transcription is observed in about two-thirds of human genes.\"\nIn vertebrates, \"dispersed transcription is typically observed in constitutive promoters in CpG islands.\"\n\n【31】 #Distal promoters\nA distal promoter is a portion of the promoter for a particular gene. This distal sequence upstream of the gene is a region of DNA that may contain additional regulatory elements, often with a weaker influence than the proximal promoter.\n\"he distal promoter . can range several thousands of nucleotides upstream of the TSS and contains additional regulatory elements called enhancers and silencers.\"\n\"Several thousand sex-differential distal enhancers have been identified in mouse liver\". Some \"1847 mouse liver genomic regions  significant sex differential occupancy by cohesin and  CTCF, two key 3D nuclear organizing factors. These sex-differential binding sites were primarily distal to sex-biased genes but rarely generated sex-differential TAD (topologically associating domain) or intra-TAD loop anchors, and were sometimes found in TADs without sex-biased genes.\"\n\"Cohesin depletion reduced the expression of male-biased genes with distal, but not proximal, sex-biased enhancers by >10-fold, implicating cohesin in long-range enhancer interactions regulating sex-biased genes.\"\nSex \"differences in distal sex-biased enhancer–promoter interactions are common. Intra-TAD loops with sex-independent cohesin-and-CTCF anchors conferred sex specificity to chromatin interactions indirectly, by insulating sex-biased enhancer–promoter contacts and by bringing sex-biased genes into closer proximity to sex-biased enhancers.\"\nSex-differential \"chromatin interactions involving sex-biased gene promoters, enhancers, and lncRNAs were associated with sex-biased binding of cohesin and/or CTCF.\"\n\"3D genome organization impacts sex-biased gene expression in a non-reproductive tissue through both direct and indirect effects of cohesin and CTCF looping on distal enhancer interactions with sex-differentially expressed genes.\"\n\"Distal enhancer viewpoint near  A1bg and female-biased  lncRNAs  includes 12 female-biased and nuclear-enriched mono-exonic lncRNAs, which fall into three clusters. The lncRNAs in each cluster are all transcribed from the same strand,  and  direction of transcription of the most upstream lncRNA in each cluster.\"\n\"Robust interactions were observed in female but not male livers between the viewpoint enhancer and three genomic regions : a strong female-biased enhancer , the promoter of A1bg , and a region downstream of A1bg that contains a cluster of four female-specific lncRNAs , where  the strongest interactions . The lncRNAs in this cluster are more highly expressed  and are more consistently female-biased across various RNA-seq datasets than the other two lncRNA clusters .\"\n\"The precise relationship between the female-biased expression of these lncRNAs and the female-bias in 3D interactions with the distal enhancer is not known. The interaction may be regulatory in nature (e.g. an enhancer–promoter interaction, as with any gene) or it could be facilitated by one or more of the 12 nuclear-enriched, female-biased lncRNAs, as was described for the lncRNAs Xist , Firre , and Haunt . Alternatively, the female-specific interactions shown may be primarily those of regulatory enhancers driving expression of several female-specific genes—including A1bg and multiple lncRNAs. The female-biased CTCF binding seen at both interacting regions  lends mechanistic support for the latter proposal, with CTCF mediating enhancer–promoter and enhancer–enhancer interactions. As CTCF is known to interact with lncRNAs in a functional manner, and with high affinity , these two mechanisms are not mutually exclusive; one or more of these highly female-specific lncRNAs  could function in a cis-acting manner to selectively guide CTCF binding and interactions unique to female liver.\"\nFemale-biased \"proximal enhancer–promoter interactions in  gene region associated with female-biased cohesin binding,  female-biased interactions between the A1bg promoter, a far distal (> 100 kb) enhancer, and distal female-biased CTCF binding sites .\"\n\"A1bg exemplifies direct regulation, where female-biased CTCF binding can explain the observed female-bias in looping interactions.\"\n\"In , the highly female-biased gene A1bg is nearby several strongly female-biased, nuclear-enriched mono-exonic lncRNAs, several of which are transcribed from genomic loci that show female-specific interactions with the distal female-specific enhancer viewpoint .\"\nWhile \"most sex-biased binding sites for CTCF and cohesin were found to be distal from sex-biased genes, a subset likely contributes to sex-biased looping between regulatory elements in cis, as exemplified by the female-biased DNA looping interactions observed for A1bg.\"\n\n【32】 ## AGC boxes\nAn AGC box has the consensus sequence AGCCGCC in the direction of transcription. It may also occur as TCGGCGG in the direction of transcription, or inverted which has been reported: CCGCCGA and GGCGGCT. Ideally, each of these four should be tested on each of the four possible transcription directions.\nA1BG has four possible transcription directions:\n- on the negative strand from ZSCAN22 to A1BG,\nFor each transcription promoter that interacts directly with RNA polymerase II holoenzyme, the four possible consensus sequences need to be tested on the four possible transcription directions, even though some genes may only be transcribed from the negative strand in the direction on the transcribed strand.\n\n【33】 ## Enhancer boxes\nIt is a transcription factor binding site where the specific sequence of DNA, CANNTG, is recognized by proteins that can bind to it to help initiate its transcription. Once transcription factors bind to promoters, they allow for association of other enzymes which will copy the DNA into mRNA. The consensus sequence for the E-box element is CANNTG, with a palindromic canonical sequence of CACGTG. Transcription factors containing the basic helix-loop-helix protein structural motif typically bind to E-boxes or related variant sequences and enhance transcription of the downstream gene.\n\n【34】 #Proximal promoters\nA 'proximal promoter' is a proximal sequence upstream of the gene, specifically the transcription start site (TSS) of the gene, that tends to contain primary regulatory elements. It is approximately 250 nucleotides (nts) upstream (signified by a negative sign before the number of nucleotides, eg. -250 nts) of the TSS and has specific transcription factor binding sites.\n\"he proximal promoter  a region containing several regulatory elements, which ranges up to a few hundred nucleotides upstream of the TSS\".\n\n【35】 ## CArG boxes\n\"CArG box  DNA  sequences present within the promoters of SMC genes play a pivotal role in controlling their transcription\".\n\"Serum response factor (SRF) controls  SMC gene transcription via binding to CArG box DNA sequences found within genes that exhibit SMC-restricted expression.\"\n\"SMC genes examined in this study display SMC-specific histone modifications at the 5′-CArG boxes.\"\n\"The SRF-CArG association is required for transcriptional activation of SMC genes  the SMC genes examined in this study display SMC-specific histone modifications at the 5′-CArG boxes.  enrichment of H4 and H3 acetylation  were relatively low from positions –2,800 to –1,600 in the 5′ region.

We observed similar patterns for H3K4dMe and H3 Lys79 di-methylation . SRF, TFIID, and RNA polymerase II displayed enrichments that were consistent with the positions of the CArG boxes, TATA box, and coding region, respectively\".\nThe CArG boxes occur between -400 and -200 nts, between the E boxes and the TCE element.\n\n【36】 Testing the more general 3'-C(C/A/T)(A/T)6(A/G)G-5':\n\n【37】 ## HY boxes\nThe hypertrophy region HY box is between -89 and -60 nucleotides (nts) upstream from the transcription start site.\n\n【38】 ## HNF6\nConsensus sequence for HNF6 is DWRTCMATXD, but TTATTGATTA found.

Before each untranslated region are nucleotides between the genes.\nBetween ZNF497 and A1BG are 1006 nts before the TSS from this direction. Between ZSCAN22 and A1BG there are 4618 nts.\nDepending on which direction the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme transcribes from is the exact nt of the transcription start site (TSS). For transcription from the ZNF497 direction the TSS sits among the local nts as follows: TTGG+1GGC. For transcription from the ZSCAN22 direction, the TSS sits among TGAA+1ACT.\nNCBI at the National Institutes of Health includes these in between nucleotides as well as those for each gene.

Some programs aim to predict the exact location of the promoter region of known protein-coding genes, while others focus on finding the transcription start site .\" \"he current state-of-the-art in promoter prediction is biased toward housekeeping genes that contain CpG islands.\"\nEach of the currently described promoter elements is tested for possible occurrences between ZSCAN22 and A1BG on both the negative and positive strands, and between ZNF497 and A1BG on both strands, going from the neighboring gene toward A1BG.\n\n【43】 ## E boxes\nA1BG has an E-box: 3'-CACATG-5' ending at -2118 nt (G) in the distal promoter region.\n\n【44】 ## MREs\nOn the negative strand going from ZSCAN22 to A1BG, there are no MREs.\n\n【45】 ## eIF4Es\nA1BG does not have an eIF4E basal element on the template strand between ZSCAN22 and A1BG TSS.\n\n【46】 ## HY boxes\nThe only HY box upstream or downstream from A1BG ends (G) at -3711 nts (3'-TGTGGG-5') upstream from the TSS.\n\n【47】 ## CAAT boxes\nA1BG does not have a CAAT box in the transcription direction along the negative strand from ZSCAN22 to A1BG.\n\n【48】 ## GC boxes\nA1BG does not have a GC box in the transcription direction on either the positive or negative strand (ZSCAN22 to A1BG).\n\n【49】 ## BREs\nThere are three B recognition elements (BREs) going along the negative strand from ZSCAN22 to A1BG: 3'-CCACGCC-5' out 380 nts from the last nt of the ending untranslated region for ZSCAN22, 3'-CCGCGCC-5' out 1762, and 3'-CCACGCC-5' out 2197 nts.\n\"The position in nucleotides (nts) relative to the transcription start site (TSS, +1)\" is -35 for the BRE.\" None of the three BREs located are anywhere near the TSS at some 4600 nts out from ZSCAN22.\n\n【50】 ## TATA boxes\nOn the positive strand, in the nucleotide region between gene ZSCAN22 (NCBI GeneID: 342945) and A1BG (NCBI GeneID: 1) are 211 TATA box-like 8 nt long sequences. Of these, - TATAAAAG occurs at 58853713 + 183 nts and - TATAAAAG at 58853713 + 222. This is a TATA box found with some genes. But, the optimal TBP recognition sequence 3'-TATATAAG-5', does not occur.\n- TATAAA occurs seven times, with the closest one at 2874 nts from the end of ZSCAN22. \"In virtually every RNA polymerase II-transcribed gene examined, the sequence TATAAA was present 25 to 30 nts upstream of the transcription start site.\"\nA1BG does not have a TATA box in the core promoter region. There is the sequence 3'-TGCTATATAGATGGCAACTAAGCACTTGGGGAAAAAA-5' for which the first nt (T) is number 58856598 or 1574 nt upstream from the beginning of the 3'-UTR at 58858172. Unless another variant exists, -1574 nt from the beginning of the 3'-UTR is a large number of nts away from the TSS.\nThe closest TATA box-like sequence is 3'-CTCTTAAG-5' on the template strand at 4408 nts from the end of ZSCAN22, which is upstream from the core promoter.\nThe extra TATA boxes between ZSCAN22 and A1BG strongly suggest that there is at least one gene (or pseudogene) between ZSCAN22 and A1BG not currently in the NCBI database.\nOn the negative strand between ZNF497 and A1BG, there are no TATA boxes of the form 3’-TATA-A/T-A-A/T-A/G-5’.\nFor the negative strand going from ZSCAN22 to A1BG there are two TATA boxes: 3'-TATATATA-5' at 1600 nts and 3'-TATATAAA-5' at 1602 nts. These are way too far from the possible TSS in this direction.\n\n【51】 ## dBREs\nA1BG does not have a TATA box. The closest 7 nucleotide dBRE is at -450 nts which is outside the core promoter in the distal promoter. The closest 6 nt dBRE of consensus sequence 3'-A/G-T-A/G/T-G/T-G/T-G/T-5' is also at -451 nts.\nConsensus sequence 3'-T-A/G/T-G/T-G/T-G/T-G/T-5' has an expression at -108 nts with 3'-TGGGTG-5' in the proximal promoter.\n3'-T-A/G/T-G/T-G/T-G/T-5' is another 5 nts consensus sequence that has a dBRE at -109 nts with 3'-TGGGT-5'.\nAnother 5 nts consensus sequence that has the same dBRE at -99 nts is 3'-GTGTG-5' in the proximal promoter.\nA 4 nts consensus sequence has a dBRE at -100 nts is 3'-GTGT-5' also in the proximal promoter.\nA second set of 4 nts consensus sequence dBREs are at -59 nts and +2 nts. The dBRE has not been reported to include the TSS.\nA third 4 nts consensus sequence dBRE occurs at -43 nts, roughly just outside the core promoter, with another including the TSS and none in between.\n\n【52】 ## XCPE 1s\nThere is no X core promoter element 1 between ZSCAN22 and A1BG on the template strand.\n\n【53】 ## MTEs\nThere is no motif ten element between ZSCAN22 and A1BG on the template strand.\n\n【54】 ## GAACs\nThere are two GAAC elements in the distal promoter between ZSCAN22 and A1BG.\nA1BG does not have a GAAC element within 2-7 nucleotides of the TSS. The closest GAAC element, 3'-GAACT-5', is -999 nts from the TSS.\n\n【55】 ## Inrs\nAlong the negative strand from ZSCAN22 to A1BG there are at least 43 initiator elements, with the closest one 3'-TCACACT-5' ending at 4361 nts rather than including the TSS of A+1 at 4460 nts.\nIn the sequence along the positive strand of nucleotides from genes ZSCAN22 and A1BG, the sequence 3'-CCATCCACT-5' occurs only once, just before the transcription start site (TSS) of the A1BG gene. The DCE 3'-CTT-5' contains the TSS at its 5' end.\nThe TSS for A1BG has the following nts around it: 3'-CCATCCACTT+1TGAGGACAC-5'. Most genes studied early on contained an adenosine (A+1) at the TSS, a cytosine (C-1), and a few pyrimidines (Pys) surrounding these nts.\nUsually the Inr contains the TSS. The sequence 3'-CCACTT+1T-5' does contain the TSS but not at A+1. The nearest other Inr ends -24 nt upstream from the TSS.\nThere are at least 15 Inrs between ZSCAN22 and A1BG.\nThe sequence 3'-CCACTT+1T-5' is also an Inr, where the TSS is indicated. But, the only DPE nearby 3'-GGACA-5' begins on the fourth nt (+5) after the TSS (+1), not precisely +28 to +32 relative to the TSS nucleotide. No other DPE is even close to this +28 to +32 window.\n\n【56】 ## AGCE1s\nA1BG contains 3'-CTT+1-5'. This is an angiotensinogen core promoter element 1 (AGCE1).\nThe AGCE1 occurs at 3'-CTT+1-5' and 3'-ATC-5' which ends 5 nts upstream from the first and is the only AGCE1 within -25 and -1 nts of the TSS.\n\n【57】 ## DCEs\nThe downstream core element (DCE) SI 3'-CTT+1-5' contains the TSS but is not downstream of the TSS. Of the DCE SI elements, the closest is some 60 nts downstream from the TSS (3'-CTTC-5' ending at +69).\nOf the DCE SII elements such as 3'-CTGT-5', there are none within +1 to +100 nts downstream. Element 3'-CTG-5' occurs starting at +32 nts, which is some +11 nts further downstream than expected and falls within the range for SIII. The element 3’-TGT-5’ has no occurrence within the TSS and +100 nts downstream.\nDCE SIII elements (3’-AGC-5’) occur at +19 and +28 nts. The second DCE SIII is close but overlaps any likely nts for DCE SII and is supposed to be after any DCE SII. The DCE SII is unlikely to be used but the second DCE SIII may be close enough to act alone.\nAlong the negative strand from ZSCAN22 to A1BG and past the TSS, there are no DCE SIs of the type 3'-CTTC-5' past the TSS. Of the type 3'-CTT-5', only one occurs at 4552 nts or 92 nts past the TSS. For type 3'-TTC-5' of DCE SI the closest past is 3'-TTC-5' ending at 4504, or 44 nts past the TSS.\nType SII 3'-CTGT-5' has the closest one ending at 4468 nts and the next ending at 4507 nts.\n\n【58】 ## DPEs\nWithin the nucleotides of the negative strand going from gene ZSCAN22 to A1BG are at least 163 downstream promoter elements (DPEs), when using the minimal five-nucleotide consensus sequence. There are three DPEs near the required +28  to +32  nts from the TSS at 4460 nts from the end of ZSCAN22: 3'-GGTCG-5' at 4480, 3'-AGTCG-5' at 4489, and 3'-GGACC-5' at 4494 nts.\n\n【59】 #TAFs\nEach of the foregoing core promoter elements does not appear to be involved in the transcription of A1BG. The Inr does not contain the known TSS. The DCE is not supposed to contain the TSS, nor is AGCE1 although it is one nt off by containing it. Currently, the only way to default transcribe A1BG is by directing the transcription program directly to the known TSS.\nWhen there is no TATA box in the promoter, a TAF binds sequence specifically, and forces the TBP to bind non-sequence specifically.\n\n【60】 #5'-untranslated region\nThe 5' UTR for A1BG contains some 216 nts, depending upon the location of the TSS.\n3’-T+1TGAGGACACGAGATCCCAGCCCACTCAGCCCTGGGAGTCCAAAGACATTTTAAACAGAGCCTCTCTTCACATTTA\nTTAATTCCTGGGAGGAATGAGGGAGGCTTCTCCAGCCCCCCAGAGACCCCGGCCTTGTGCTGCAACAGGAGGGGA\nGGGAGCCAGTCCAGAATCCCCGGCACTTCTGAGGACACCAACAGCACCCTGGGCCCGCGGCTGCA-5’\nThe five prime untranslated region (5' UTR), can contain elements for controlling gene expression by way of regulatory elements. It begins at the transcription start site and ends one nucleotide (nt) before the start codon (usually AUG) of the coding region, The 5' UTR has a median length of ~150 nt in eukaryotes, but can be as long as several thousand bases, Several regulatory sequences may be found in the 5' UTR:\n- Binding sites for proteins, that may affect the mRNA's stability or translation, for example iron responsive elements, that regulate gene expression in response to iron.\n- Riboswitches.\n- Sequences that promote or inhibit translation initiation.\n- Introns within 5' UTRs have been linked to regulation of gene expression and mRNA export.\n\n【61】 #TBP binding\nIf TBP can bind to any variety of seven A/Ts before the TSS, then the sequence 3'-AAAAAATAATAATTA-5' is likely to be the 3'-\"xod-ATAT\"-5', rather than the traditional 3'-\"TATA-box\"-5'. The first (T)-5' is at 58858405, only 233 nts from TSS, but way outside the core promoter.\n\n【62】 #RNA polymerase II holoenzymes\nRNA polymerase II . is recruited to the promoters of protein-coding genes in living cells.

Cardiac surgeons undertaking this procedure should have specific training in the use of cryoablation equipment\n\n【2】 #The procedure\n\n【3】 #Indications\nAtrial fibrillation is the irregular and rapid beating of the upper two chambers of the heart (the atria). It may be classified as paroxysmal, persistent or permanent. It is the most common type of arrhythmia and the incidence increases markedly with age. Patients with atrial fibrillation may be asymptomatic or they may have symptoms such as palpitations, dizziness and breathlessness. They also have an increased risk of stroke as a result of blood clots forming in the left atrium and then embolising to the brain.\nAtrial fibrillation usually occurs in the absence of structural heart disease. However, if structural heart disease is present, it is most commonly mitral stenosis.\nConservative treatments include medication, electrical cardioversion to control the heart rhythm, and anticoagulants to prevent the formation of blood clots. The conventional surgical approach, known as the Cox maze procedure, involves making multiple, strategically placed incisions in both atria to isolate and stop the abnormal electrical impulses. Alternative methods of creating lesions in the atria by ablation have been developed, using energy sources such as radiofrequency, microwave and ultrasound.\n\n【4】 #Outline of the procedure\nCryoablation for atrial fibrillation is typically carried out in patients undergoing concomitant open heart surgery (often mitral valve replacement or repair). A cryoprobe is used to freeze heart tissue. The damaged tissue forms linear scars or lesions that disrupt the transmission of the abnormal electrical impulses. The procedure may be carried out on both atria or on the left atrium only. It can be performed from within or outside the atrium.\n\n【5】 #Efficacy\nOne non-randomised trial compared patients treated with mitral valve surgery and cryoablation with patients who had mitral valve surgery and the Cox maze procedure. At discharge, 85% (94/110) of patients treated with cryoablation were in sinus rhythm, compared with 86% (95/110) of patients treated with the Cox maze procedure (p = 0.84). The survival rate at 3 years was 92% for the cryotherapy group and 98% for the Cox maze group (p = 0.32).\nTwo non-randomised trials compared patients who had cryoablation and concomitant heart valve surgery with patients who had heart valve surgery only. In the cryoablation groups, 100% (36/36) and 78% (25/32) of patients were in sinus rhythm immediately after surgery, compared with 33% (5/15) and 22% (4/18) of patients in the control groups. In one of these trials, 90% (26/29) of patients treated with cryoablation were in sinus rhythm at 9 months, compared with 25% (4/16) of patients in the control group. In the other trial, 78% (28/36) of patients treated with cryoablation and 20% (3/15) of patients in the control group were in sinus rhythm at 6 months\nThe Specialist Advisors considered this procedure to be a variation on the Cox maze technique.\n\n【6】 #Safety\nThis procedure is performed during open heart surgery; therefore it is difficult to differentiate the complications that relate specifically to cryoablation.\nThree studies reported in-hospital mortality, which ranged from 0% (0/28) to 3% (3/95, 1/32). In four studies, 3% (1/32) to 14% (4/28) of patients required a pacemaker following surgery. Other complications included re-operation; delayed cardiac tamponade; mediastinitis; low cardiac output; the need for an intra-aortic balloon pump; dialysis; and transient ischaemic attack\nThe Specialist Advisors noted that oesophageal injury, heart block, damage to the circumflex coronary artery and intra-operative myocardial infarction were potential adverse effects of the procedure.\n\n【7】 #Other comments\nMost of the data were on patients having mitral valve surgery. There was only limited evidence on the efficacy of cryoablation when performed with other procedures such as coronary artery bypass grafting.\nThis procedure appears to be more efficacious in patients whose atrial fibrillation has been of short duration (less than 1 year).\nIt was noted that there are variations in technique and cryotherapy parameters used for this procedure. It was also noted that it may be difficult to determine when a full-thickness ablation has been achieved.\nNICE has published interventional procedures guidance on radiofrequency ablation for atrial fibrillation and microwave ablation for atrial fibrillation. NICE is also currently developing a guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of atrial fibrillation .\n\n【8】 #\nThe evidence considered by the Interventional Procedures Advisory Committee is described in the following document.\nInterventional procedures overview of cryoablation for atrial fibrillation as an associated procedure with other cardiac surgery, December 2004.\n\n【9】 #Information for patients\nNICE has produced information on this procedure for patients and carers.

In 1926, Dr. Benjamin Sacks and Dr. Emmanuel Libman published cases of \"valvular masses\" that were examined clinically and during autopsies and found to be free of all microorganisms. These masses were initially named \"indeterminate endocarditis\".\n\n【2】 #Classification\nAccording to Allen and Sirota,  Non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis may be classified according to morphology into 5 subtypes.\n\n【3】 #Pathophysiology\nAlthough the exact pathogenesis of non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis is not completely understood, endothelial injury correlated with a hypercoagulable state has been implicated. Pathogenesis can be sub-sectioned into four factors thought to be involved in instigating NBTE. These include; Immune complexes, Hypoxia , Hypercoagulability, andCarcinomatosis. Conditions associated with nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis include; Malignancies, Systemic autoimmune diseases ,SLE is the most common,Hypercoagulable states, Chronic inflammatory states, Heart failure with valvulopathy, e.t.c.\n\n【4】 #Differentiating non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis from other Diseases\nNon-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis must be differentiated from other diseases that cause a new or changed heart murmur, multiple systemic emboli, +/-fever, such as infective endocarditis, degenerative valvular disease, and pulmonary infarction.\n\n【5】 #Epidemiology and Demographics\nNon-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis is a rare autopsy finding. Although the exact incidence of NBTE is unknown, it is thought to be approximately 900-600 per 100,000 individuals worldwide. The prevalence of NBTE is approximately 9,300 per 100,000 individuals worldwide. Patients of all age groups may develop NBTE, usually in the 4th to 8th decade. There is no racial predilection to NBTE, and NBTE affects men and women equally.\n\n【6】 #Risk Factors\nThe most potent risk factor in the development of non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis is advanced malignancy. Other risk factors include systemic lupus erythematosus, antiphospholipid syndrome, and chronic inflammatory states.\n\n【7】 #Screening\nThere is insufficient evidence to recommend routine screening for non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis.\n\n【8】 #Natural History, Complications, and Prognosis\nNon-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis is an asymptomatic condition that can present acutely with recurrent thromboembolism. Prognosis is generally poor, as the disease is associated with advanced cancers, autoimmune diseases and recurrent thromboembolism.\n\n【9】 ## Diagnostic Study of Choice\nThere is no single diagnostic study of choice for the diagnosis of non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis.\n\n【10】 ## History and Symptoms\nThe majority of patients with non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis are asymptomatic. Systemic embolism of the brain, liver, or spleen is a common initial clinical manifestation of NBTE, and occur in more than half of patients. Patients with NBTE may have a positive history of malignancy, disseminated intravascular coagulation, antiphospholipid syndrome, autoimmune disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus, e.t.c\n\n【11】 ## Physical Examination\nThere are no specific physical exam findings for non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis. Patients with NBTE may show signs of systemic thromboembolism, cardiac dysfunction, and underlying diseases.\n\n【12】 ## Laboratory Findings\nThere are no specific diagnostic laboratory findings associated with non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis. Tests are usually conducted to detect the underlying cause of NBTE and differentiate it from infective endocarditis.\n\n【13】 ## X-ray\nThere are no x-ray findings associated with non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis. However, a chest x-ray may be helpful in the diagnosis of complications of NBTE, which include, cardiomegaly pulmonary congestion, pleural effusion, and calcifications due to the lesions.\n\n【14】 ## Echocardiography and Ultrasound\nEchocardiography may be helpful in the diagnosis of non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis. It is especially important in visualizing valvular vegetations suggestive of NBTE. The vegetations in NBTE are typically <1cm, broad-based, and irregularly shaped. 75% of vegetations affect the mitral valves and less commonly have been found to involve all the cardiac valves.\n\n【15】 ## Other Imaging Findings\nWhole-body CT or MRI may be helpful in the diagnosis of non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis. It may show evidence of systemic embolism in patients with undetermined NBTE.\n\n【16】 ## Other Diagnostic Studies\nThere are no other diagnostic studies associated with non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis.\n\n【17】 ## Medical Therapy\nThere is no treatment for non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis; the mainstay of therapy is the identification and treatment of the underlying condition, with an aim to reduce the risk of systemic embolism. Unless there is a specific contraindication, anti-coagulation with IV unfractionated heparin or subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin is recommended in all patients with a clinical diagnosis of NBTE.\n\n【18】 ## Interventions\nThere are no recommended therapeutic interventions for the management of non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis\n\n【19】 ## Surgery\nSurgery is not the first-line treatment option for patients with non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis and is usually reserved for patients with either heart failure, acute valve rupture, or recurrence of thromboembolism despite adequate anticoagulation. It is important to weigh the risks associated with the patient's underlying condition with the benefits of surgery.\n\n【20】 ## Primary Prevention\nThere are no established measures for the primary prevention of non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

It is also commonly known as Wallenberg's syndrome or posterior inferior cerebellar artery syndrome (PICA). The most common cause is thromboembolic occlusion of vertebral arteries. It was described in 1895. The lateral medullary syndrome is basically a manifestation of the vaso-occlusive disease of intracranial vertebral arteries (ICVA) such as vertebral artery or posterior inferior cerebellar artery. The various pathophysiologic mechanisms involved can include; atherosclerosis, athero-embolic phenomenon (heart, aorta, or vertebral arteries), dissection and increased vascular tortuosity, vascular insufficiency, Virchow’s triad play an important role in understanding the pathogenesis of Wallenberg's syndrome.\n\n【2】 #Historical Perspective\n- Gaspard Vieusseux, in 1808, was the first person to describe Wallenberg's syndrome.\n- This syndrome was later on further elaborated by Adolf Wallenberg, in 1895.\n- Thomas William was the first person to document extensive anatomy and physiology of brain stem, the cerebellum, and the ventricles in the 17th century.

It is not very well understood, but the disease is thought to arise following intense emotional or physical stress. Stress cardiomyopathy mostly affects post-menopausal women. The clinical presentation, laboratory findings and imaging studies largely mimic that of anterior MI. However, the absence of significant coronary artery stenosis supports the diagnosis of stress cardiomyopathy. It is generally a self-limiting disease and the majority of patients have a restored cardiac function within a matter of weeks. Complications and death are relatively rare, but they are mostly related to the development of heart failure and pulmonary edema.\n\n【2】 #Historical Perspective\nStress cardiomyopathy is a relatively new disease, with the first case documented in literature in Japan in 1991. However, cases of death upon going through severe emotional or psychological stress have been described as early as the biblical times.\n\n【3】 #Classification\nStress cardiomyopathy can be divided into several types, depending on the location of regional wall motion abnormality. The area of motion abnormality (whether hypokinesia, dyskinesia or akinesia) can be detected on echocardiography or left ventriculography. The most common type is the apical type, resulting in apical ballooning.\n\n【4】 #Pathophysiology\nThe pathogenesis of stress cardiomyopathy is not completely understood. However, the most accepted theory behind it is thought to be due to catecholamine surge, which are thought to contribute to myocardial necrosis and stunning seen in stress cardiomyopathy. On biopsy, findings include an inflammatory infiltrate, fibrosis and formation of contraction bands, which may or may not be associated with myocardial necrosis. Stress cardiomyopathy is associated with various neurological and psychological conditions.\n\n【5】 #Causes\nThe cause of stress cardiomyopathy is largely unknown. However, it is usually triggered by emotional and/or physical stress and may be related to certain medical conditions.\n\n【6】 #Differentiating Stress Cardiomyopathy from Other Diseases\nThe clinical presentation, laboratory findings and imaging studies of stress cardiomyopathy resembles that of anterior MI and must be differentiated from it. Also, stress cardiomyopathy must be differentiated from other medical conditions, such as pheochromocytoma, dilated cardiomyopathy and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.\n\n【7】 #Epidemiology and Demographics\nThe true incidence and prevalence of stress cardiomyopathy is unknown. However, this disease most commonly affects post-menopausal women, with the mean age of diagnosis ranging between 58-75 years.\n\n【8】 #Risk Factors\nStress cardiomyopathy seems to be triggered by intense emotional or physical stress, mostly the unexpected death of a loved one.\n\n【9】 #Screening\nThere are no screening recommendations for stress cardiomyopathy.\n\n【10】 #Natural History, Complications and Prognosis\nThe prognosis of stress cardiomyopathy is generally excellent, with most patients making a complete recovery within a matter of weeks. However, death from complications of heart failure and heart rupture may occur.\n\n【11】 #Diagnostic Criteria\nIn 2004, researchers at the Mayo Clinic proposed a criteria for the diagnosis of stress cardiomyopathy. All 4 points of the criteria must be fulfilled, which include ruling out other medical conditions, such as obstructive coronary disease, myocarditis and pheochromocytoma.\n\n【12】 #History and Symptoms\nThe most common presenting symptoms of stress cardiomyopathy are shortness of breath and chest pain.\n\n【13】 #Physical Examination\nPhysical examination findings in patients with stress cardiomyopathy are non-specific and non-diagnostic. The diagnosis of stress cardiomyopathy is largely based on ECG, echocardiographic findings, as well as cardiac catheterization.\n\n【14】 #Laboratory Findings\nElevated levels of catecholamines, cardiac enzymes and BNP may be seen in patients with stress cardiomyopathy. However, none of these laboratory findings are specific to stress cardiomyopathy.\n\n【15】 #ECG\nECG findings in stress cardiomyopathy are similar to those seen in anterior MI. The most common findings include ST elevation in the precordial leads, T wave inversion and the formation of a Q wave. Findings on ECG include:\n\n【16】 #Chest X-Ray\nTypical findings on chest x-ray include apical ballooning and narrowing of the neck.\n\n【17】 #CT Scan\nA CT scan may be done in patients with stress cardiomyopathy to asses coronary anatomy, as well as detect the presence of regional wall motion abnormalities.\n\n【18】 #MRI\nCardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is a useful imaging modality in distinguishing between stress cardiomyopathy and myocarditis or MI. The most common findings on CMR in patients with stress cardiomyopathy include absence of gadolinium hyper-enhancement, as well as myocardial edema.\n\n【19】 #Echocardiography\nEchocardiography is done in patients with stress cardiomyopathy to document apical ballooning, dyskinesia/akinesia and reduced ejection fraction.\n\n【20】 #Other Imaging Findings\nIn patients with stress cardiomyopathy, coronary angiography usually shows normal anatomy of the coronary arteries no evidence of coronary artery stenosis.\n\n【21】 #Other Diagnostic Studies\nCoronary angiography and cardiac catheterization are the diagnostic modalities of choice to distinguish between stress cardiomyopathy and acute anterior MI. Normal anatomy of the coronary arteries, along with a reduced ejection fraction supports the diagnosis of stress cardiomyopathy.\n\n【22】 #Medical Therapy\nMedical therapy in stress cardiomyopathy is indicated to treat the complications that may arise. The most common complications related to stress cardiomyopathy include heart failure and pulmonary edema. Diuretics and anti-heart failure medications are the treatment of choice in these conditions.\n\n【23】 #Surgery\nTreatment of stress cardiomyopathy is mostly supportive and medications are used to treat complications. There is no role for surgery in the treatment of stress cardiomyopathy.\n\n【24】 #Primary Prevention\nThere are no means of prevention of stress cardiomyopathy.\n\n【25】 #Secondary Prevention\nStress cardiomyopathy is a self-limiting disease, which usually resolves within a few weeks. However, medical therapy may be necessary during the acute phase of the illness or when complications arise.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "17023a29-c396-478f-91bb-e2fcaa6c8451", "title": null, "text": "【0】 Prochlorperazine (injection)\n\n【1】 #Overview\nProchlorperazine (injection) is a antiemetic that is FDA approved for the treatment of severe nausea and vomiting, schizophrenia  Common adverse reactions include drowsiness, dizziness, amenorrhea, blurred vision, skin reactions and hypotension.\n\n【2】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Adult)\n- To control severe nausea and vomiting. For the treatment of schizophrenia.\n- Prochlorperazine has not been shown effective in the management of behavioral complications in patients with mental retardation.\n- Notes on Injection\n- For intramuscular administration, inject deeply into the upper, outer quadrant of the buttock.Subcutaneous administration is not advisable because of local irritation.\n- Stability\n- This solution should be protected from light. A slight yellowish discoloration will not alter potency. If markedly discolored, solution should be discarded.\n- It is recommended that prochlorperazine injection not be mixed with other agents in the syringe.\n- (For children's dosage and administration, see below.) Dosage should be increased more gradually in debilitated or emaciated patients.\n- In general, dosages in the lower range are sufficient for most elderly patients. Since they appear to be more susceptible to hypotension and neuromuscular reactions, such patients should be observed closely. Dosage should be tailored to the individual, response carefully monitored and dosage adjusted accordingly. Dosage should be increased more gradually in elderly patients.\n- I.M. Dosage: Initially 5 to 10 mg (1 to 2 mL) injected deeply into the upper outer quadrant of the buttock. If necessary, repeat every 3 or 4 hours. Total I.M. dosage should not exceed 40 mg per day.\n- I.V. Dosage: 2.5 to 10 mg (0.5 to 2 mL) by slow I.V. injection or infusion at a rate not to exceed 5 mg per minute. Prochlorperazine edisylate injection may be administered either undiluted or diluted in isotonic solution. A single dose ofthe drug should not exceed 10 mg; total I.V. dosage should not exceed 40 mg per day. When administered I.V. do not use bolus injection. Hypotension is a possibility if the drug is given by I.V. injection or infusion.\n- Subcutaneous administration is not advisable because of local irritation.\n- Adult Surgery (for severe nausea and vomiting): Total parenteral dosage should not exceed 40 mg per day. Hypotension is a possibility if the drug is given by I.V. injection or infusion.\n- I.M. Dosage: For immediate control of adult schizophrenic patients with severe symptomatology, inject an initial dose of 10 to 20 mg (2 to 4 mL) deeply into the upper outer quadrant of the buttock. Many patients respond shortly after the first injection. If necessary, however, repeat the initial dose every 2 to 4 hours (or, in resistant cases, every hour) to gain control of the patient. More than three or four doses are seldom necessary. After control is achieved, switch patient to an oral form of the drug at the same dosage level or higher. If, in rare cases, parenteral therapy is needed for a prolonged period, give 10 to 20 mg (2 to 4 mL) every 4 to 6 hours. Pain and irritation at the site of injection have seldom occurred.\n\n【3】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Prochlorperazine (injection) in adult patients.\n\n【4】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Prochlorperazine (injection) in adult patients.\n\n【5】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Pediatric)\n- DO NOT USE IN PEDIATRIC SURGERY.\n- Children seem more prone to develop extrapyramidal reactions, even on moderate doses. Therefore, use lowest effective dosage. Tell parents not to exceed prescribed dosage, since the possibility of adverse reactions increases as dosage rises. Occasionally the patient may react to the drug with signs of restlessness and excitement; if this occurs, do not administer additional doses. Take particular precaution in administering the drug to children with acute illnesses or dehydration .\n- Severe Nausea and Vomiting in Children: Prochlorperazine should not be used in pediatric patients under 20 pounds in weight or 2 years of age. It should not be used in conditions for which children's dosages have not been established. Dosage and frequency of administration should be adjusted according to the severity of the symptoms and the response of the patient. The duration of activity following intramuscular administration may last up to 12 hours. Subsequent doses may be given by the same route if necessary.\n- I.M. Dosage: Calculate each dose on the basis of 0.06 mg of the drug per lb of body weight; give by deep I.M. injection. Control is usually obtained with one dose.\nChildren with Schizophrenia:\n- Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.\n\n【6】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Prochlorperazine (injection) in pediatric patients.\n\n【7】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Prochlorperazine (injection) in pediatric patients.\n\n【8】 #Contraindications\n- Do not use in patients with known hypersensitivity to phenothiazines.\n- Do not use in comatose states or in the presence of large amounts of central nervous system depressants (alcohol, barbiturates, narcotics, etc.).\n- Do not use in pediatric surgery.\n\n【9】 ### Precautions\n- In clinical trial and postmarketing experience, events of leukopenia/neutropenia and agranulocytosis have been reported temporally related to antipsychotic agents. Possible risk factors for leukopenia/neutropenia include preexisting low white blood cell count (WBC) and history of drug induced leukopenia/neutropenia. Patients with a preexisting low WBC or a history of drug induced leukopenia/neutropenia should have their complete blood count (CBC) monitored frequently during the first few months of therapy and should discontinue Prochlorperazine Edisylate Injection USP at the first sign of a decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors. Patients with neutropenia should be carefully monitored for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treated promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count less than 1000/mm3) should discontinue Prochlorperazine Edisylate Injection USP and have their WBC followed until recovery. Prochlorperazine's antiemetic action may mask signs and symptoms of overdosage of other drugs and may obscure the diagnosis and treatment of other conditions such as intestinal obstruction, brain tumor and Reye's syndrome .When prochlorperazine is used with cancer chemotherapeutic drugs, vomiting as a sign of the toxicity of these agents may be obscured by the antiemetic effect of prochlorperazine. Because hypotension may occur, large doses and parenteral administration should be used cautiously in patients with impaired cardiovascular systems. To minimize the occurrence of hypotension after injection, keep patient lying down and observe for at least 1/2 hour. If hypotension occurs after parenteral dosing, place patient in head-low position with legs raised. If a vasoconstrictor is required, norepinephrine and phenylephrine are suitable. Other pressor agents, including epinephrine, should not be used because they may cause a paradoxical further lowering of blood pressure. Aspiration of vomitus has occurred in a few post-surgical patients who have received prochlorperazine as an antiemetic. Although no causal relationship has been established, this possibility should be borne in mind during surgical aftercare. Deep sleep, from which patients can be aroused, and coma have been reported, usually with overdosage. Antipsychotic drugs elevate prolactin levels; the elevation persists during chronic administration. Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately one third of human breast cancers are prolactin-dependent in vitro, a factor of potential importance if the prescribing of these drugs is contemplated in a patient with a previously detected breast cancer. Although disturbances such as galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia and impotence have been reported, the clinical significance of elevated serum prolactin levels is unknown for most patients. An increase in mammary neoplasms has been found in rodents after chronic administration of antipsychotic drugs. Neither clinical nor epidemiologic studies conducted to date, however, have shown an association between chronic administration of these drugs and mammary tumorigenesis; the available evidence is considered too limited to be conclusive at this time. Chromosomal aberrations in spermatocytes and abnormal sperm have been demonstrated in rodents treated with certain antipsychotics. As with all drugs which exert an anticholinergic effect, and/or cause mydriasis, prochlorperazine should be used with caution in patients with glaucoma. Because phenothiazines may interfere with thermoregulatory mechanisms, use with caution in persons who will be exposed to extreme heat.\n- Phenothiazines can diminish the effect of oral anticoagulants. Phenothiazines can produce alpha-adrenergic blockade. Thiazide diuretics may accentuate the orthostatic hypotension that  may occur with phenothiazines. Antihypertensive effects of guanethidine and related compounds may be counteracted when phenothiazines are used concomitantly. Concomitant administration of propranolol with phenothiazines results in increased plasma levels of both drugs. Phenothiazines may lower the convulsive threshold; dosage adjustments of anticonvulsants may be necessary. Potentiation of anticonvulsant effects does not occur. However, it has been reported that phenothiazines may interfere with the metabolism of phenytoin and thus precipitate phenytoin toxicity. The presence of phenothiazines may produce false-positive phenylketonuria (PKU) test results.\n- Given the likelihood that some patients exposed chronically to antipsychotics will develop tardive dyskinesia, it is advised that all patients in whom chronic use is contemplated be given, if possible, full information about this risk. The decision to inform patients and/or their guardians must obviously take into account the clinical circumstances and the competency of the patient to understand the information provided. To lessen the likelihood of adverse reactions related to cumulative drug effect, patients with a history of long-term therapy with prochlorperazine and/or other antipsychotics should be evaluated periodically to decide whether the maintenance dosage could be lowered or drug therapy discontinued. Children with acute illnesses (e.g. chickenpox, CNS infections, measles, gastroenteritis) or dehydration seem to be much more susceptible to neuromuscular reactions, particularly dystonias, than are adults. In such patients, the drug should be used only under close supervision. Drugs which lower the seizure threshold, including phenothiazine derivatives, should not be used with metrizamide. As with other phenothiazine derivatives, prochlorperazine should be discontinued at least 48 hours before myelography, should not be resumed for at least 24 hours postprocedure, and should not be used for the control of nausea and vomiting occurring either prior to myelography with metrizamide, or postprocedure.\n\n【10】 ## Clinical Trials Experience\n- Drowsiness, dizziness, amenorrhea, blurred vision, skin reactions and hypotension may occur. Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with antipsychotic drugs . Cholestatic jaundice has occurred. If fever with grippe-like symptoms occurs, appropriate liver studies should be conducted. If tests indicate an abnormality, stop treatment. There have been a few observations of fatty changes in the livers of patients who have died while receiving the drug. No causal relationship has been established. Leukopenia and agranulocytosis have occurred. Warn patients to report the sudden appearance of sore throat or other signs of infection. If white blood cell and differential counts indicate leukocyte depression, stop treatment and start antibiotic and other suitable therapy.\n- Symptoms may include agitation or jitteriness and sometimes insomnia. These symptoms often disappear spontaneously. At times these symptoms may be similar to the original neurotic or psychotic symptoms. Dosage should not be increased until these side effects have subsided.\n- If these symptoms become too troublesome, they can usually be controlled by a reduction of dosage or change of drug. Treatment with antiparkinsonian agents, benzodiazepines or propranolol may be helpful.\n- Class effect: Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups.\n- As with all antipsychotic agents, tardive dyskinesia may appear in some patients on long-term therapy or may appear after drug therapy has been discontinued. The syndrome can also develop, although much less frequently, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses. This syndrome appears in all age groups. Although its prevalence appears to be highest among elderly patients, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict at the inception of antipsychotic treatment which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. The symptoms are persistent and in some patients appear to be irreversible. The syndrome is characterized by rhythmical involuntary movements of the tongue, face, mouth or jaw (e.g. protrusion of tongue, puffing of cheeks, puckering of mouth, chewing movements). Sometimes these may be accompanied by involuntary movements of extremities. In rare instances, these involuntary movements of the extremities are the only manifestations of tardive dyskinesia. A variant of tardive dyskinesia, tardive dystonia, has also been described.\n- There is no known effective treatment for tardive dyskinesia; anti-parkinsonism agents do not alleviate the symptoms of this syndrome. It is suggested that all antipsychotic agents be discontinued if these symptoms appear. Should it be necessary to reinstitute treatment, or increase the dosage of the agent, or switch to a different antipsychotic agent, the syndrome may be masked.\n- Avoid getting the injection solution on hands or clothing because of the possibility of contact dermatitis.\n- Adverse Reactions Reported with Prochlorperazine or Other Phenothiazine Derivatives Adverse reactions with different phenothiazines vary in type, frequency and mechanism of occurrence, i.e. some are dose-related, while others involve individual patient sensitivity. Some adverse reactions may be more Iikely to occur, or occur with greater intensity, in patients with special medical problems, e.g. patients with mitral insufficiency or pheochromocytoma have experienced severe hypotension following recommended doses of certain phenothiazines.\n- Not all of the following adverse reactions have been observed with every phenothiazine derivative, but they have been reported with 1 or more and should be borne in mind when drugs of this class are administered: extrapyramidal symptoms (opisthotonos, oculogyric crisis, hyperreflexia, dystonia, akathisia, dyskinesia, parkinsonism) some of which have lasted months and even years -- particularly in elderly patients with previous brain damage; grand mal and petit mal convulsions, particularly in patients with EEG abnormalities or history of such disorders; altered cerebrospinal fluid proteins; cerebral edema; intensification and prolongation of the action of central nervous system depressants (opiates, analgesics, antihistamines, barbiturates, alcohol), atropine, heat, organophosphorus insecticides; autonomic reactions (dryness of mouth, nasal congestion, headache, nausea, constipation, obstipation, adynamic ileus, ejaculatory disorders/impotence, priapism, atonic colon, urinary retention, miosis and mydriasis); reactivation of psychotic processes, catatonic-like states; hypotension (sometimes fatal); cardiac arrest; blood dyscrasias ,pancytopenia, thrombocytopenic purpura, leukopenia, agranulocytosis, eosinophilia, hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia; liver damage (jaundice, biliary stasis); endocrine disturbances (hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, glycosuria, lactation, galactorrhea, gynecomastia, menstrual irregularities, false-positive pregnancy tests); skin disorders (photosensitivity, itching, erythema, urticaria, eczema up to exfoliative dermatitis); other allergic reactions (asthma, laryngeal edema, angioneurotic edema, anaphylactoid reactions); peripheral edema; reversed epinephrine effect; hyperpyrexia; mild fever after large I.M. doses; increased appetite; increased weight; a systemic lupus erythematosus-like syndrome; pigmentary retinopathy; with prolonged administration of substantial doses, skin pigmentation, epithelial keratopathy, and lenticular and corneal deposits.\n- EKG changes -- particularly nonspecific, usually reversible Q and T wave distortions -- have been observed in some patients receiving phenothiazine tranquilizers.\n- Although phenothiazines cause neither psychic nor physical dependence, sudden discontinuance in long-term psychiatric patients may cause temporary symptoms, e.g. nausea and vomiting, dizziness, tremulousness.\nNote: There have been occasional reports of sudden death in patients receiving phenothiazines. In some cases, the cause appeared to be cardiac arrest or asphyxia due to failure of the cough reflex.\n\n【11】 ## Postmarketing Experience\nThere is limited information regarding Postmarketing Experience of Prochlorperazine (injection) in the drug label.\n\n【12】 #Drug Interactions\nThere is limited information regarding Prochlorperazine (injection) Drug Interactions in the drug label.\n\n【13】 ### Pregnancy\nPregnancy Category (FDA): C\nThere is no FDA guidance on usage of Prochlorperazine (injection) in women who are pregnant.\n\n【14】 ### Labor and Delivery\nThere is no FDA guidance on use of Prochlorperazine (injection) during labor and delivery.\n\n【15】 ### Nursing Mothers\n- There is evidence that phenothiazines are excreted in the breast milk of nursing mothers. *Caution should be exercised when prochlorperazine is administered to a nursing woman.\n\n【16】 ### Pediatric Use\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Prochlorperazine (injection) with respect to pediatric patients.\n\n【17】 ### Geriatic Use\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Prochlorperazine (injection) with respect to geriatric patients.\n\n【18】 ### Gender\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Prochlorperazine (injection) with respect to specific gender populations.\n\n【19】 ### Race\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Prochlorperazine (injection) with respect to specific racial populations.\n\n【20】 ### Renal Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Prochlorperazine (injection) in patients with renal impairment.\n\n【21】 ### Hepatic Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Prochlorperazine (injection) in patients with hepatic impairment.\n\n【22】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Prochlorperazine (injection) in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n\n【23】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\nThere is no FDA guidance one the use of Prochlorperazine (injection) in patients who are immunocompromised.\n\n【24】 ### Administration\n- Intravenous\n\n【25】 ### Monitoring\nThere is limited information regarding Monitoring of Prochlorperazine (injection) in the drug label.\n\n【26】 #IV Compatibility\nThere is limited information regarding IV Compatibility of Prochlorperazine (injection) in the drug label.\n\n【27】 #Overdosage\nSymptoms:\n- Primarily involvement of the extrapyramidal mechanism producing some of the dystonic reactions described above.\n- Symptoms of central nervous system depression to the point of somnolence or coma. Agitation and restlessness may also occur. Other possible manifestations include convulsions, EKG changes and cardiac arrhythmias, fever and autonomic reactions such as hypotension, dry mouth and ileus.\nTreatment:\n- It is important to determine other medications taken by the patient since multiple-dose therapy is common in overdosage situations. Treatment is essentially symptomatic and supportive. Early gastric lavage is helpful. Keep patient under observation and maintain an open airway, since involvement of the extrapyramidal mechanism may produce dysphagia and respiratory difficulty in severe overdosage. Do not attempt to induce emesis because a dystonic reaction of the head or neck may develop that could result in aspiration of vomitus. Extrapyramidal symptoms may be treated with anti-parkinsonism drugs, barbiturates or Benadryl.  prescribing information for these products. Care should be taken to avoid increasing respiratory depression.\n- If administration of a stimulant is desirable, amphetamine, dextroamphetamine or caffeine with sodium benzoate is recommended.\n- Stimulants that may cause convulsions (e.g. picrotoxin or pentylenetetrazol) should be avoided.\n- If hypotension occurs, the standard measures for managing circulatory shock should be initiated. If it is desirable to administer a vasoconstrictor, Levophed and Neo-Synephrine are most suitable. Other pressor agents, including epinephrine, are not recommended because phenothiazine derivatives may reverse the usual elevating action of these agents and cause a further lowering of blood pressure.\n- Limited experience indicates that phenothiazines are not dialyzable.\n\n【28】 ## Mechanism of Action\nThere is limited information regarding Prochlorperazine (injection) Mechanism of Action in the drug label.\n\n【29】 ## Structure\n- Prochlorperazine Edisylate Injection USP, 2-Chloro-10-phenothiazine 1,2-ethanedisulfonate (1:1), has the following structural formula:\n- Molecular Formula: C20H24CIN3SC2H6O6S2  M.W. = 564.14\n- Prochlorperazine Edisylate Injection, an antiemetic and antipsychotic, is a sterile solution intended for intramuscular or intravenous administration.\nEach mL contains, in aqueous solution, 5 mg prochlorperazine as the edisylate salt, 5 mg sodium biphosphate, 12 mg sodium tartrate, 0.9 mg sodium saccharin and 0.75% benzyl alcohol as preservative.

These 'multi-drug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii' are often referred to as MDRAB.\n\n【2】 #Biology\nAcinetobacter baumannii is the most relevant human pathogen within the Acinetobacter genus.\nMost A. baumannii isolates are multiresistant, containing in their genome small, isolated islands of alien (meaning transmitted genetically from other organisms) DNA and other cytological and genetic material; this has led to more virulence. Acinetobacter have no flagellum; the name is Greek for 'motionless'.\n\n【3】 #Transmission and Prevalence\nAcinetobacter enters into the body through open wounds, catheters, and breathing tubes. It usually infects those with compromised immune systems, such as the wounded, the elderly, children or those with immune diseases. Colonization poses no threat to people who aren't already ill, but colonized health care workers and hospital visitors can carry the bacteria into neighboring wards and other medical facilities.\nThe number of nosocomial infections (hospital-acquired infections) caused by A. baumannii has increased in recent years.\nThe first military outbreaks of severe A. Baumannii infections occurred in April, 2003 in American soldiers returning from Iraq. Early reports attributed the infections to the Iraqi soil. Later testing demonstrated widespread contamination of field hospitals as the most plausible vector.\n\n【4】 #Virulence and Pathogenicity\nThis opportunistic pathogen causes a wide variety of serious infections in humans, mostly in compromised patients. Recently, A. baumannii has emerged as an important pathogen among wounded soldiers, threatening civilian and military patients.\nNosocomial A. baumannii bacteremia may cause severe clinical disease that is associated with a high mortality rate of up to 75%.\nThis opportunistic pathogen expresses a myriad of factors that could play a role in human pathogenesis. Among these factors are the attachment to and persistence on solid surfaces, the acquisition of essential nutrients such as iron, the adhesion to epithelial cells and their subsequent killing by apoptosis, and the production and/or secretion of enzymes and toxic products that damage host tissues. However, very little is known about the molecular nature of most of these processes and factors and almost nothing has been shown with regard to their role in bacterial virulence and the pathogenesis of serious infectious diseases. Fortunately, some of these gaps can now be filled by testing appropriate isogenic derivatives in relevant animal models that mimic the infections in humans, particularly the outcome of deadly pneumonia. Such an approach should provide new and relevant information on the virulence traits of this normally underestimated bacterial human pathogen.\n\n【5】 #Control and Treatment of Infections\nMulti-resistant A. baumannii infections are currently treated with imipenem and an older class of drugs known as polymyxins. These, along with stricter infection-control measures, such as monitored hand washing, have lowered infection rates in some military hospitals.\nMDRAB infections are difficult and costly to treat. A study at a public teaching hospital found that the mean total hospital cost of patients who acquired MDRAB was $98,575 higher than that of control patients who had identical burn severity of illness indices.\n\n【6】 ## Antimicrobial regimen\n- Acinetobacter baumannii\n- Preferred regimen : Imipenem 0.5-1 g IV q6h\n- Alternative regimen : Ceftriaxone 1-2 g IV qd", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Humans are the only known host of this parasite. Humans can also be infested with the pubic or crab louse (Pthirus pubis) and/or with the  body louse (Pediculus humanus humanus).Head lice infect hair on the head. Tiny eggs on the hair look like flakes of dandruff. However, instead of flaking off the scalp, they stay put. Head lice can live up to 30 days on a human. Their eggs can live for more than 2 weeks. Head lice spread easily, particularly among school children. Head lice are more common in close, overcrowded living conditions.\nPediculus humanus capitis is most commonly found on the scalp, behind the ears and near the neckline at the back of the neck. Head lice hold on to hair with hook-like claws found at the end of each of their six legs. Head lice are rarely found on the body, eyelashes, or eyebrows.\n\n【2】 #Morphology\nThe dorso-ventrally flattened body of the louse is divided into head, thorax and abdomen. On the head, one pair of eyes and one pair of antennae are clearly visible. The mouthparts are adapted to piercing the skin and sucking blood.  The legs, with their terminal claws, are adapted to holding the hair-shaft. They cannot jump from head to head and being wingless insects they also cannot fly.  In males (Fig.1), the first pair of legs are slightly larger and also used for holding the female during copulation. Males are slightly smaller than females and are characterized by the pointed end of the abdomen and the well-developed genital apparatus visible inside the abdomen. Females are characterized by two gonopods in the shape of a W at the end of their abdomen . The eggs (Fig.3) are oval-shaped and ca. 0.8 mm in length. Immediately after oviposition they are shiny, round, and transparent. Head lice are 1-3 mm in size, varying according to their stage of development. They are usually grayish in color but depending on the time since their previous blood-meal they can be also reddish-brown.\n- Fig. 1. Male of head louse\n- Fig.3.Louse egg\n\n【3】 #Biology\nDuring its lifespan of 4 weeks a female louse lays 50-150 eggs (nits). The egg hatches to the first nymphal stage, which after three moltings develop to nymph 2, nymph 3 and eventually to either a male or female louse. Adult lice copulate frequently and the females lay an average of 3-4 eggs daily. A generation lasts for about 1 month. All stages are blood-feeders and they bite the skin 4-5 times daily to feed. During oviposition the female excretes a glue-like substance from a gland located at the posterior end of the body and attaches the eggs on the hair of the host. Although any part of the scalp may be colonized, lice favor the nape of the neck and the area behind the ears, where the eggs are usually laid.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "39b89bb5-9313-4284-b239-347054ab4cfc", "title": null, "text": "【0】 Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are a major public health problem worldwide, affecting quality of life and causing serious morbidity and mortality. STIs have a direct impact on reproductive and child health through infertility, cancers and pregnancy complications, and they have an indirect impact through their role in facilitating sexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and thus they also have an impact on national and individual economies. More than a million STIs are acquired every day. In 2012, an estimated 357 million new cases of curable STIs (gonorrhoea, chlamydia, syphilis and trichomoniasis) occurred among 15-to 49-year-olds worldwide, including 5.6 million cases of syphilis. There are an estimated 18 million prevalent cases of syphilis.\nSyphilis is a bacterial STI caused by Treponema pallidum that results in substantial morbidity and mortality. Syphilis is transmitted through sexual contact with infectious lesions of the mucous membranes or abraded skin, via blood transfusion, or transplacentally from a pregnant woman to her fetus.\nMother-to-child transmission of syphilis (congenital syphilis) is usually devastating to the fetus if maternal infection is not detected and treated sufficiently early in pregnancy. The burden of morbidity and mortality due to congenital syphilis is high. In 2012, an estimated 350 000 adverse pregnancy outcomes worldwide were attributed to syphilis, including 143 000 early fetal deaths/stillbirths, 62 000 neonatal deaths, 44 000 preterm/low-birth-weight babies and 102 000 infected infants. Most untreated primary and secondary syphilis infections in pregnancy result in severe adverse pregnancy outcomes. Latent (asymptomatic) syphilis infections in pregnancy also cause serious adverse pregnancy outcomes in more than half of cases. The fetus can be easily cured with treatment, and the risk of adverse outcomes to the fetus is minimal if the mother receives adequate treatment during early pregnancy -ideally before the second trimester.\n\n【1】 #RATIONALE FOR THE GUIDELINES\nSince the publication of the WHO Guidelines for the management of sexually transmitted infections in 2003, changes in the epidemiology of STIs and advancements in prevention, diagnosis and treatment necessitate changes in STI management.\nScreening all pregnant women for syphilis at first antenatal care visit is recommended in many countries of the world and is being scaled up rapidly in countries committed to the elimination of mother-to-child transmission (EMTCT) of HIV and syphilis. In most settings, the screening and diagnosis of syphilis is based on serologic tests. Recent advances in the development of rapid treponemal syphilis tests means that there are additional testing options that could be added to the historical set of screening tools, which include laboratory-based non-treponemal tests (e.g. RPR and VDRL) and treponemal tests (e.g. TPPA, TPHA). Countries are in urgent need of guidance related to screening for syphilis in pregnancy.\nThis guideline provides updated recommendations for syphilis screening and treatment for pregnant women based on the most recent evidence and available serologic tests for syphilis\nThe objectives of this guideline are:\n- to provide evidence-based guidance on syphilis screening and treatment for pregnant women; and\nThis guideline was developed following the methods outlined in the 2014 WHO handbook for guideline development. The Guideline Development Group (GDG) included international STI experts, clinicians, researchers and programme managers. The GDG prioritized questions related to screening and treatment of syphilis in pregnant women. A methodologist and a team of systematic reviewers from McMaster University, the WHO Collaborating Centre for Evidence-Informed Policy, independently conducted systematic reviews or updated systematic reviews of the literature for the diagnostic accuracy and effectiveness of different syphilis screening and treatment strategies. Costeffectiveness analyses were used to inform these recommendations. The evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach and presented to the GDG. Declarations of interests were obtained from the GDG and conflicts of interest were managed according to WHO guidelines and declared before the recommendations were discussed and finalized. Research implications were also developed by the GDG.\ncongenital syphilis have been previously published and updated  in the WHO guidelines for the treatment of Treponema pallidum (syphilis). The same recommendations for the treatment of syphilis in pregnant women  are included in this guideline to provide a comprehensive approach to managing pregnant women, including recommendations for both screening and treatment.\n\n【2】 #Recommendations Strength of recommendation and quality of evidence\nScreening for maternal syphilis Recommendation 1\nThe WHO STI guideline recommends screening all pregnant women for syphilis during the first antenatal care visit.\nRemarks: This recommendation applies to all settings, including settings with high or low prevalence of syphilis.\n\n【3】 #Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence\nScreening strategies a Recommendation 2\nIn settings with low coverage of syphilis screening and treatment for pregnant women, high loss to follow-up of pregnant women, or limited laboratory capacity, the WHO STI guideline suggests on-site tests (Strategies A, B and C) rather than the standard off-site laboratory-based screening and treatment strategy.\n\n【4】 #Recommendation 3\nIn settings with a low prevalence of syphilis (below 5%), the WHO STI guideline suggests a single on-site rapid syphilis test (RST) be used to screen pregnant women (Strategy A) rather than a single on-site rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test (Strategy B).\n\n【5】 #Recommendation 4\nIn settings with a high prevalence of syphilis (5% or greater), the WHO STI guideline suggests an on-site rapid syphilis test (RST) and, if positive, provision of a first dose of treatment and a rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test, and then, if the RPR test is positive, provision of treatment according to duration of syphilis (Strategy C). The WHO STI guideline suggests this sequence of tests and treatment rather than a single on-site RST (Strategy A) or a single on-site RPR test (Strategy B).\nRemarks: These recommendations do not apply to countries that can provide appropriate/high-quality laboratory-based screening and treatment strategies. However, in some settings there may be challenges providing such strategies and/ or a sequence of tests. When resources do not permit the use of a sequence of tests, a single on-site rapid syphilis test (RST) (Strategy A) is suggested to ensure greater screening coverage despite the number of pregnant women who will be over-treated due to the high rate of false-positive results. Treatment is based on duration of syphilis, according to the WHO guideline for the treatment of Treponema pallidum (syphilis) b.\n\n【6】 #Strength of recommendation and quality of evidence\nEarly syphilis (primary, secondary and early latent syphilis of not more than two years' duration)\n\n【7】 #Recommendation 5\nIn pregnant women with early syphilis, the WHO STI guideline recommends benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units once intramuscularly over no treatment.\n\n【8】 #Recommendation 6\nIn pregnant women with early syphilis, the WHO STI guideline suggests using benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units once intramuscularly over procaine penicillin 1.2 million units intramuscularly once daily for 10 days.\nWhen benzathine or procaine penicillin cannot be used (e.g. due to penicillin allergy where penicillin desensitization is not possible) or are not available (e.g. due to stockouts), the WHO STI guideline suggests using, with caution, erythromycin 500 mg orally four times daily for 14 days or ceftriaxone 1 g intramuscularly once daily for 10-14 days or azithromycin 2 g once orally.\nRemarks: Although erythromycin and azithromycin treat the pregnant women, they do not cross the placental barrier completely and as a result the fetus is not treated. It is therefore necessary to treat the newborn infant soon after delivery . Ceftriaxone is an expensive option and is injectable. Doxycycline should not be used in pregnant women. Because syphilis during pregnancy can lead to severe adverse complications to the fetus or newborn, stock-outs of benzathine penicillin for use in antenatal care should be avoided.\n\n【9】 #Conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence\nSummary of existing recommendations on syphilis treatment for pregnant women Late syphilis (infection of more than two years' duration without evidence of treponemal infection)\n\n【10】 #Recommendation 7\nIn pregnant women with late syphilis (more than two years' duration) or unknown stage of syphilis, the WHO STI guideline recommends benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units intramuscularly once weekly for three consecutive weeks over no treatment.\nThe interval between consecutive doses of benzathine penicillin should not exceed 14 days.\n\n【11】 #Recommendation 8\nIn pregnant women with late syphilis (more than two years' duration) or unknown stage of syphilis, the WHO STI guideline suggests benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units intramuscularly once weekly for three consecutive weeks over procaine penicillin 1.2 million units intramuscularly once a day for 20 days When benzathine or procaine penicillin cannot be used (e.g. due to penicillin allergy where penicillin desensitization is not possible) or are not available (e.g. due to stockouts), the WHO STI guideline suggests using, with caution, erythromycin 500 mg orally four times daily for 30 days.\nRemarks: Although erythromycin treats the pregnant women, it does not cross the placental barrier completely and as a result the fetus is not treated. It is therefore necessary to treat the newborn infant soon after delivery . Doxycycline should not be used in pregnant women. Because syphilis during pregnancy can lead to severe adverse complications to the fetus or newborn, stockouts of benzathine penicillin for use in antenatal care should be avoided,\nA WHO STI expert consultation recommended updating the WHO 2003 guidelines for the first-and second-line treatments for C. trachomatis, increasing the dosage of ceftriaxone to 250 mg for treatment of N. gonorrhoeae with continued monitoring of antimicrobial susceptibility, and consideration of azithromycin (2 g, single dose) as an alternative treatment for early syphilis .\nThe epidemiology of STIs is changing, with viral pathogens becoming more prevalent than bacterial etiologies for some conditions; this means that updated information is required to inform locally appropriate prevention and treatment strategies. An increasing proportion of genital ulcers is now due to viral infections, as previously common bacterial infections (such as chancroid) approach elimination in many countries . The chronic, lifelong nature of viral infections also requires that renewed attention be paid to developing effective prevention strategies, including expanding access to available vaccines for HPV and development of new vaccines for HSV-2.\nIn the 2003 WHO guidelines, a syndromic approach was recommended for the management of STIs.\n\n【12】 #APPROACH TO THE REVISION OF STI GUIDELINES\nTo ensure effective treatment for all STIs, WHO plans a phased approach to updating the STI guidelines to address a range of infections and issues. Four phases have been proposed by the WHO STI Secretariat and agreed upon by the STI Guideline Development Group (GDG) members\n\n【13】 #Phases Topics Timeframe\nPhase  - Syphilis screening and treatment for pregnant women (this publication).\nIn addition, guidelines for the STI syndromic approach and a clinical management package will be developed later in Phase 1. Phase 2 will focus on guidelines for STI prevention. Mother-to-child transmission may occur if the expectant mother has syphilis. Mother-to-child transmission of syphilis (congenital syphilis) is usually devastating to the fetus in cases where maternal infection is not detected and treated sufficiently early in pregnancy. The burden of morbidity and mortality due to congenital syphilis is high. In 2012, an estimated 350 000 adverse pregnancy outcomes worldwide were attributed to syphilis, including 143 000 early fetal deaths/stillbirths, 62 000 neonatal deaths, 44 000 preterm/low-birth-weight babies and 102 000 infected infants. There is also an increase in mother-to-child transmission of HIV among pregnant women coinfected with syphilis and HIV. Untreated primary and secondary syphilis infections in pregnancy typically result in severely adverse pregnancy outcomes, including fetal deaths in a substantial proportion of cases. Latent syphilis infections in pregnancy result in serious adverse pregnancy outcomes in more than half of cases. The burden of disease is highest in low-and middle-income countries, particularly in the WHO African Region .\nCongenital syphilis is preventable, however, and elimination of mother-to-child transmission of syphilis can be achieved through implementation of effective early screening and treatment strategies for syphilis in pregnant women . The fetus can be easily cured with treatment, and the risk of adverse outcomes to the fetus is minimal if the mother receives adequate treatment during early pregnancy -ideally before the second trimester . There are indications that motherto-child transmission of syphilis is beginning to decline globally due to increased efforts to screen and treat pregnant women for syphilis. antibodies. Since these antibodies can also be produced in other diseases, non-treponemal tests are not highly specific for syphilis and can give false-positive results in conditions such as acute febrile viral infections and some chronic autoimmune diseases. Most false-positive results have low titres of less than 1 : 4. Non-treponemal tests may be negative for up to four weeks after the lesion of primary syphilis first appears and can be negative in late latent syphilis; additionally in primary and secondary syphilis, these tests may be falsenegative due to a prozone reaction (i.e. interference by high concentrations of antibodies in a specimen, which can be uncovered by dilution and retesting). In primary syphilis, repeated testing at two and four weeks may be required to exclude syphilis when suspect lesions are present. A negative non-treponemal test at three months after onset of the primary chancre virtually excludes the diagnosis of syphilis.\n\n【14】 #LABORATORY DIAGNOSIS AND SCREENING\nNon-treponemal tests may be qualitative or quantitative. Quantitative non-treponemal test titres can be used to monitor response to treatment. Titres are expected to decrease following effective treatment and increase in untreated active infection. A four-fold change or higher in titre, equivalent to a change of at least two dilutions (e.g. from 1 : 16 to 1 : 4 for effective positive response to treatment, or from 1 : 8 to 1 : 32 for continued active infection) is considered a significant difference between two sequential tests using the same method (e.g. VDRL or RPR) and preferably by the same laboratory. Titres that differ by only one dilution (e.g. 1 : 8 versus 1 : 4 or 1 : 2 versus 1 : 1) are not considered significant and may only represent differences in laboratory interpretation.\nTreponemal tests include the Treponema pallidum haemagglutination assay (TPHA), the Treponema pallidum particle agglutination assay (TPPA) and the fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) tests. These tests are highly specific because they detect antibodies against treponemal-specific antigens; however, they do not differentiate venereal syphilis from endemic syphilis (the latter includes yaws and pinta). Classically, one of these tests is used as a confirmatory test following a positive non-treponemal test. Treponemal tests usually remain positive (85%) for the patient's lifetime, regardless of treatment. Thus, a positive treponemal test does not distinguish between active infection and infection that has been previously treated.\n\n【15】 #RATIONALE FOR NEW RECOMMENDATIONS\nThe WHO Guidelines for the management of sexually transmitted infections, published in 2003 , recommended early screening and treatment of pregnant women with syphilis, ideally prior to the second trimester of pregnancy, to prevent fetal complications. Screening all pregnant women for syphilis at first antenatal care visit is recommended in many countries of the world and is being scaled up rapidly in countries committed to the elimination of mother-to-child transmission (EMTCT) of HIV and syphilis.\nRecent advances in the development of RSTs and dual treponemal-HIV rapid tests means that there are many testing options to add to the historical set of screening tools, which include laboratory-based non-treponemal tests (e.g. RPR and VDRL) and treponemal tests (e.g. TPPA, TPHA). Countries are in urgent need of guidance as to how to select and implement the most appropriate screening strategies for syphilis in pregnancy to ensure that coverage of syphilis screening is increased and that all pregnant women with syphilis receive adequate treatment. It is essential to provide recommendations on syphilis screening and treatment strategies for different health-care settings, including the optimal sequence of tests for syphilis screening and the optimal approach for subsequent treatment.\nThe objectives of this guideline are:\n- to provide evidence-based guidance on syphilis screening and treatment for pregnant women; and\n\n【16】 #TARGET AUDIENCE\nThis guideline is primarily intended for health-care providers at all levels (primary, secondary and tertiary) of the health-care system involved in the treatment and management of people with STIs in low-, middle-and high-income countries. It is also intended for individuals working in sexual and reproductive health programmes, such as HIV/AIDS, family planning, maternal and child health and adolescent health, to ensure appropriate STI diagnosis and management.\nThis guideline is also useful for policy-makers, managers, programme officers and other professionals in the health sector who are responsible for implementing STI management interventions at regional, national and subnational levels.\n\n【17】 #STRUCTURE OF THE GUIDELINE\nThis guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for syphilis screening and treatment for pregnant women to prevent mother-to-child transmission of syphilis. This guideline provides direction for countries as they develop national recommendations; however, national guidelines should also take into account the existing laboratory infrastructure, heath service capacity and resources.\nThe methods for the development of the recommendations for syphilis screening for pregnant women are described below and the methods specific to the treatment of syphilis in pregnant women are described in the WHO guidelines for the treatment of Treponema pallidum (syphilis) . 1 These two guidelines have been developed together and are interlinked. They are two among several guideline modules that will be consolidated into a comprehensive STI guideline.\n\n【18】 #GUIDELINE DEVELOPMENT GROUP (GDG)\nTo update the WHO guidelines for the prevention, treatment and management of STIs, a GDG was established, comprising 33 international STI experts, including clinicians, researchers and programme managers (Annex A). A core subgroup to focus on the guidelines related to syphilis was created within the GDG, to provide more intensive feedback throughout the process (Annex A). The GDG reviewed and approved the final version of the guidelines.\n\n【19】 #QUESTIONS AND OUTCOMES\nIn December 2013, the first GDG meeting was held to identify and agree on the key PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcome) questions that formed the basis for the systematic reviews and the recommendations. Following this meeting, a survey of GDG members was conducted to prioritize the questions and outcomes according to clinical relevance and importance. PICO questions were identified for syphilis screening for pregnant women including questions relating to the options of no screening, mass treatment and test strategies using different tests . Only outcomes that were ranked as critical or important to patients and decision-making were included: treatment rate (over-and under-treatment), cost per case detected, cost per women screened, screening coverage, side-effects, adverse events associated with medicines and penicillin, accessibility, partner notification and treatment, maternal completion of treatment before delivery, maternal complications and infant outcomes (Annex B).\n\n【20】 #REVIEWS OF THE EVIDENCE\nThe systematic reviews for each priority question were conducted by McMaster University, the WHO Collaborating Centre for Evidence-Informed Policy. Evidence for desirable and undesirable outcomes, patient values and preferences, resources, acceptability, equity and feasibility were reviewed from published and unpublished literature. Comprehensive searches for previously conducted systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials and non-randomized studies were performed up to October 2016. Additional searches were conducted to identify studies on patient values and preferences (e.g. qualitative research designs) and resources (e.g. cost-effectiveness studies).\nSince there was little data directly comparing screening to no screening, or comparing different test strategies to each other and comparing their effects on important patient outcomes, cost-effectiveness modelling studies were used to provide evidence. For the question comparing screening to no screening, data from a previously published cost-effectiveness analysis were used . Numbers of infant outcomes were presented.\nThis guideline was developed following the methods outlined in the 2014 edition of the WHO handbook for guideline development  .\nFor the question comparing different test strategies, the evidence was modelled from diagnostic test accuracy data and the calculated effects on important patient outcomes. A published cost-effectiveness analysis used field data for the rates of syphilis screening and treatment in countries with low and high prevalence of syphilis, as well as data on the sensitivity and specificity of single rapid syphilis tests (RSTs) in the field and from published research, and data on the effects of treatments . The data used in the analysis were confirmed using another unpublished systematic review of test accuracy data of single RSTs . The outputs of the cost-effectiveness analysis were presented by test strategy and by outcomes for screening rate, treatment rate, missed cases, over-treatment and cases treated (Web annex D)\nThe quality/certainty of the evidence was assessed at four levels:\n- High -We are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect.\n- Moderate -We are moderately confident in the effect estimate; the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different.\n- Low -Our confidence in the effect estimate is limited; the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect.\nIn addition, the direct costs of medicines were estimated using the 2014 edition of the Management Sciences for Health (MSH) International drug price indicator guide  All evidence was summarized in GRADE evidence profiles and in evidence-to-decision frameworks .\n\n【21】 #MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS\nThe evidence was presented and discussed during a second meeting of the GDG in October 2015, which was facilitated by two co-chairs -one with expertise in GRADE and the other with clinical STI expertise Therefore, the screening recommendations were formulated during subsequent teleconference calls and electronic communications with the GDG working group for syphilis. To formulate the recommendations, the GDG working group for syphilis considered and discussed the desirable and undesirable effects of the interventions, the value placed on the outcomes, the associated costs and use of resources, the acceptability of the interventions to all stakeholders (including people affected by STIs), the impact on health equity and the feasibility of implementation. The GDG working group for syphilis made judgements for each of the above criteria and an overall judgement about each recommendation and the strength of the recommendation was made. If there had been disagreements about the judgements, the planned procedure was for the GDG to take a vote and record the results. However, no votes were taken because the GDG reached consensus during discussion for all of the judgements and recommendations. Following the discussions of the GDG working group for syphilis, the recommendations were finalized via teleconference and final approval was obtained from all GDG members electronically. This guideline was subsequently written up in full and then peer reviewed. The External Review Group approved the methods and agreed with the recommendations made by the GDG (members are listed in Annex A).\nAccording to the GRADE approach, the strength of each recommendation was rated as either strong or conditional. Strong recommendations are presented using the wording \"The WHO STI guideline recommends…\", while conditional recommendations are worded as \"The WHO STI guideline suggests…\" throughout the guideline\n\n【22】 #MANAGEMENT OF CONFLICTS OF INTEREST\nManagement of conflicts of interest was a key priority throughout the process of guideline development.\nWHO guidelines for declaration of interests (DOI) for WHO experts were implemented . DOI statements were obtained from all GDG members prior to assuming their roles in the group. At the GDG meetings (December 2013 and October 2015), the members disclosed their interests, if any, at the beginning of the meetings. The DOI statements are summarized in Web annex E.\nAfter analysing each DOI, the WHO STI Secretariat concluded that no member had financial or commercial interests related to STI treatment. Other notified interests were minor; they were either not related to STI or were non-commercial grants or interests.\nThe STI team concluded that there were no significant conflicts of interest that would exclude any member from participating fully in the guideline development process. Therefore, options for conditional participation, partial or total exclusion of any GDG member were not discussed.\nStrong recommendation \"The WHO STI guideline recommends… \"\nConditional recommendation \"The WHO STI guideline suggests… \"\nFor patients Most individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action, and only a small proportion would not.\nThe majority of individuals in this situation would want the suggested course of action, but many would not.\n\n【23】 #For clinicians\nMost individuals should receive the recommended course of action.\nAdherence to this recommendation according to the guideline could be used as a quality criterion or performance indicator.\nClinicians should recognize that different choices will be appropriate for each individual and that clinicians must help each individual arrive at a management decision consistent with the individual's values and preferences.\nDecision aids may be useful to help individuals make decisions consistent with their values and preferences.\n\n【24】 #For policymakers\nThe recommendation can be adopted as policy in most situations.\nPolicy-making will require substantial debate and involvement of various stakeholders.  The guideline will be made available as a printed publication, as a download on the website of the WHO Department of Reproductive Health and Research (where there will also be links to all supporting documentation) 3 and in the WHO Reproductive Health Library (RHL) 4. The recommendations will also be available in a guideline application (\"app\") created with the GRADEpro GDT software. The guideline will be announced in the next edition of the RHL newsletter and in the Reproductive Health and Research departmental newsletter, and other relevant organizations will be requested to copy the announcement in their respective newsletters.\nWHO headquarters will work with WHO's regional offices and country offices to ensure that countries receive support in the adaptation, implementation and monitoring of this guideline using the WHO Department of Reproductive Health and Research guidance on Introducing reproductive health guidelines and tools into national programmes .\n\n【25】 #UPDATING THE STI GUIDELINES AND USER FEEDBACK\nA system of monitoring relevant new evidence and updating the recommendations as new findings become available will be established within a year of implementing the guidelines. An electronic followup survey of key end-users of this guideline will be conducted after it has been published. The results of the survey will be used to identify challenges and barriers to the uptake of the guideline, to evaluate its usefulness for improving service delivery, and to identify topics or gaps in treatment that need to be addressed in future editions.\n\n【26】 #RECOMMENDATIONS ON SYPHILIS SCREENING AND TREATMENT FOR PREGNANT WOMEN 04\n\n【27】 #SUMMARY OF THE EVIDENCE\nThere is moderate-quality evidence for large desirable effects and trivial undesirable effects of universal screening versus no screening or case finding. This evidence is based on a study that modelled rates of screening, diagnostic test accuracy data (ranging from 71-100% test sensitivity) and effects of treatment, and based on a systematic review of non-randomized studies. As large effects were found, the evidence was assessed as moderate quality. The modelling studies found that large reductions are likely for important serious adverse outcomes of pregnancy (including congenital syphilis) in settings with low and high prevalence of syphilis (0.5% and 3% of women screened, respectively). If 1 million pregnant women are screened over four years, then 278-4521 stillbirths are averted, 124-2012 neonatal deaths are averted, 206-3353 infected infants are averted and 77-1255 premature or low-birth-weight infants are averted. Another systematic review found that there were greater risks of adverse outcomes if women were screened in the third trimester of pregnancy compared to the first and second trimester.\nIn cost-effectiveness studies conducted in 2013, 2014 and 2015, there were cost savings in high-prevalence settings, and the costs per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) were within WHO standards in low-prevalence settings. The Guideline Development Group (GDG) agreed that although there may be a cost to some women for screening tests, studies providing such testing have consistently shown increases in screening coverage in different countries and settings (e.g. rural and urban settings). Universal screening may increase equity by making screening available to all pregnant women. Most studies showed that women were satisfied with being tested for syphilis. However, some were concerned about the stigma of testing (particularly if it is perceived to be HIV testing), some feared a positive result and some had concerns about the treatment implications if results were positive. Health-care providers require specific training as well as information about syphilis prevalence and risks in order to implement screening. A review of studies found that increased screening is feasible, but that stockouts of tests and medicines for treatment were often a difficulty with implementation 2-20.\n\n【28】 #RECOMMENDATION 1\nThe WHO STI guideline recommends screening all pregnant women for syphilis during the first antenatal care visit.\n\n【29】 #Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence\nRemarks: This recommendation applies to all settings, including settings with high or low prevalence of syphilis.\nOverall, the GDG agreed that universal screening is favoured over no screening because large reductions are likely for important serious adverse outcomes of pregnancy and congenital syphilis in settings with low or high prevalence of syphilis. Universal screening also probably increases equity and is cost-effective. It is likely to be acceptable to pregnant women and health-care providers, and also feasible with training and improved awareness of staff.\n\n【30】 #RECOMMENDATION 2\nIn settings with low coverage of syphilis screening and treatment for pregnant women, high loss to follow-up of pregnant women, or limited laboratory capacity, the WHO STI guideline suggests on-site tests (Strategies A, B and C) rather than the standard off-site laboratorybased screening and treatment strategy.\n\n【31】 #RECOMMENDATION 3\nIn settings with a low prevalence of syphilis (below 5%), the WHO STI guideline suggests a single on-site rapid syphilis test (RST) be used to screen pregnant women (Strategy A) rather than a single on-site rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test (Strategy B).\n\n【32】 #RECOMMENDATION 4\nIn settings with a high prevalence of syphilis (5% or greater), the WHO STI guideline suggests an on-site rapid syphilis test (RST) and, if positive, provision of a first dose of treatment and a rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test, and then, if the RPR test is positive, provision of treatment according to duration of syphilis (Strategy C). The WHO STI guideline suggests this sequence of tests and treatment rather than a single on-site RST (Strategy A) or a single on-site RPR test (Strategy B).\n\n【33】 #Conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence\nRemarks: These recommendations do not apply to countries that can provide appropriate/high-quality laboratory-based screening and treatment strategies. However, in some settings there may be challenges providing such strategies and/or a sequence of tests. When resources do not permit the use of a sequence of tests, a single on-site rapid syphilis test (RST) (Strategy A) is suggested to ensure greater screening coverage despite the number of pregnant women who will be over-treated due to the high rate of false-positive results. Treatment is based on duration of syphilis, according to the WHO guidelines for the treatment of Treponema pallidum (syphilis) .\n\n【34】 #SUMMARY OF THE EVIDENCE\nThere were no randomized controlled trials comparing different screening and treatment strategies to each other. The absolute effects of the RST are derived primarily from a cost-effectiveness model which incorporated data for the screening rates, diagnostic test accuracy data, and effects of treatments. The diagnostic test accuracy data were confirmed in a systematic review (for which the search was updated to October 2016) that pooled results from 10 studies assessing the test accuracy of on-site RST. It found that the RST had a sensitivity of 0.83 (95% CI: 0.58-0.98) and a specificity of 0.96 (95% CI: 0.89-1.00), and the rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test had a pooled sensitivity of 0.75 (95% CI: 0.54-0.88) and a pooled specificity of 0.97 (95% CI: 0.96-0.99). There is moderate certainty in these results. In the model, all tests were compared to a \"gold standard\" of laboratory-based tests of RPRpositive and TPPA-or TPHA-positive test results. Linking of the evidence from all sources resulted in low-certainty evidence.\nData from the model indicated the following:\n- The use of either (i) a single on-site RST followed by treatment (Strategy A), or (ii) an on-site RST followed by the first dose of treatment if positive, and then an RPR test (either on-or off-site) followed by appropriate treatment if this test is also positive (Strategy C), may result in slightly to moderately greater numbers of people being treated as compared to the use of on-site RPR strategies (Strategies B and, if RPR is available on-site Strategy E) in all prevalence settings (approximately 4 more per 1000 pregnant women in low-prevalence settings, and 20-30 more per 1000 in higher-prevalence settings).\n- The number of pregnant women screened appeared to be slightly greater or similar with the single onsite RST strategy (Strategy A) compared to other strategies, but similar among other strategies and among different prevalence settings.\nThe cost-effectiveness model showed that the total costs per 1000 women screened were lowest with RPR in the United Republic of Tanzania and Zambia, while in Peru use of RSTs was the cheapest due to labour costs related to the use of RPR. The model found that the most cost-effective screening and treatment approach in all prevalence settings is single on-site RST followed by treatment if positive (Strategy A; but it should be noted that the strategy may cost more in some settings).\nAlthough there were no studies directly measuring the impact of different strategies on equity, there may be a direct cost for the screening and/or treatment services for some pregnant women in some countries. However, screening rates achieved still appear to be slightly higher with the single on-site RST strategy (Strategy A), regardless of cost, indicating that such costs may not reduce equity. There were no studies comparing the acceptability of RST to RPR. However, four studies of each of the rapid tests found that health workers and pregnant women were satisfied with the RSTs, which reduced clinic visits and were easy to use. One systematic review and six studies addressed feasibility of the on-site tests. A sequence of on-site tests may be unaffordable in some settings and require adequate provider training. However, on-site tests have been successfully implemented in many countries to date 21-36.\nOverall, the GDG agreed that a strategy of using a single on-site RST followed by treatment if positive (Strategy A) or a strategy of using an on-site RST followed by a first dose of treatment if positive and also followed by an RPR test and then second and third doses of treatment if that test is also positive (Strategy C) may lead to greater numbers of people treated, fewer missed cases and fewer incidents of over-treatment compared to other strategies (Strategies B and D).\nIn lower-prevalence settings, the single on-site RST (Strategy A) or a sequence of screening tests and treatment (Strategy C) yielded similar results. However, in higher-prevalence settings, there were fewer pregnant women over-treated when using a sequence of tests and treatment (Strategy C). The single on-site RST strategy (Strategy A) is costeffective, feasible to implement and acceptable to key stakeholders.\n\n【35】 #RECOMMENDATIONS ON SYPHILIS TREATMENT FOR PREGNANT WOMEN\nRecommendations 5-8 have been directly copied from that guideline (where they were numbered Recommendations 3, 4, 7 and 8) in order to provide comprehensive information here on the appropriate approach to syphilis screening and treatment for pregnant women. Recommendations for how to prevent and treat congenital syphilis are not included here, however, but are available in that guideline. 6 EARLY SYPHILIS (PRIMARY, SECONDARY AND EARLY LATENT SYPHILIS OF NOT MORE THAN TWO YEARS' DURATION) 7 RECOMMENDATION 5\nIn pregnant women with early syphilis, the WHO STI guideline recommends benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units once intramuscularly over no treatment.\n\n【36】 #RECOMMENDATION 6\nIn pregnant women with early syphilis, the WHO STI guideline suggests using benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units once intramuscularly over procaine penicillin 1.2 million units intramuscularly once daily for 10 days.\n\n【37】 #Conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence\nWhen benzathine or procaine penicillin cannot be used (e.g. due to penicillin allergy where penicillin desensitization is not possible) or are not available (e.g. due to stock-outs), the WHO STI guideline suggests using, with caution, erythromycin 500 mg orally four times daily for 14 days or ceftriaxone 1 g intramuscularly once daily for 10-14 days or azithromycin 2 g once orally.\nRemarks: Although erythromycin and azithromycin treat the pregnant women, they do not cross the placental barrier completely and as a result the fetus is not treated, Ceftriaxone is an expensive option and is injectable. Doxycycline should not be used in pregnant women. Because syphilis during pregnancy can lead to severe adverse complications to the fetus or newborn, stock-outs of benzathine penicillin for use in antenatal care should be avoided.\n\n【38】 #RECOMMENDATION 7\nIn pregnant women with late syphilis (more than two years' duration) or unknown stage of syphilis, the WHO STI guideline recommends benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units intramuscularly once weekly for three consecutive weeks over no treatment.\n\n【39】 #Strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence\nRemarks: The interval between consecutive doses of benzathine penicillin should not exceed 14 days.\n\n【40】 #RECOMMENDATION 8\nIn pregnant women with late syphilis (more than two years' duration) or unknown stage of syphilis, the WHO STI guideline suggests benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units intramuscularly once weekly for three consecutive weeks over procaine penicillin 1.2 million units intramuscularly once a day for 20 days.\n\n【41】 #Conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence\nWhen benzathine or procaine penicillin cannot be used (e.g. due to penicillin allergy where penicillin desensitization is not possible) or are not available (e.g. due to stock-outs), the WHO STI guideline suggests using, with caution, erythromycin 500 mg orally four times daily for 30 days.\nRemarks: Although erythromycin treats the pregnant women, it does not cross the placental barrier completely and as a result the fetus is not treated, Doxycycline should not be used in pregnant women. Because syphilis during pregnancy can lead to severe adverse complications to the fetus or newborn, stock-outs of benzathine penicillin for use in antenatal care should be avoided.\nIMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS 05\n\n【42】 #ADAPTATION, IMPLEMENTATION AND MONITORING\nThese guidelines provide recommendations for syphilis screening and treatment for pregnant women, based on the best global evidence available at the time of compilation. However, the epidemiology and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) of STIs vary by geographical location and are constantly changing, sometimes rapidly. It is recommended that countries conduct good-quality studies to gather the information needed to adapt these guidelines to the local STI situation as they update their national guidelines.\nIn areas lacking local data as a basis for adaptation, the recommendations in this guideline can be adopted as presented here.\n\n【43】 #CONSIDERATION ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ANTENATAL SYPHILIS SCREENING AND TREATMENT\nA decision on whether to continue the current antenatal syphilis screening algorithm or to introduce a new syphilis screening strategy that includes treponemalbased rapid syphilis tests (RSTs) into the national system should be based on a careful assessment of the screening coverage, treatment rate, and quality of the existing system of testing. The following points should be taken into consideration.\n- Coverage: An assessment should be made of the proportion of all persons at risk and pregnant women who have access to syphilis testing.\n- Quality of testing: The quality of testing should be assessed to ensure accuracy of results.\n- Treatment of seropositive individuals: The proportion of all persons tested who subsequently receive test results and obtain treatment in a timely manner.\nIf the coverage of testing of pregnant women and the rate of treatment of seropositive individuals are not at least 95% each, consistent with the targets presented in the Global guidance on criteria and processes for validation: elimination of mother-to-child transmission of HIV and syphilis , then efforts should be made to rectify the inadequacies in the system\nIt will be essential to have accurate baseline data on the prevalence of syphilis among pregnant women, based on RPR test results which have been subsequently confirmed by Treponema pallidum haemagglutination assay (TPHA) or Treponema pallidum particle agglutination assay (TPPA). This guideline defines low syphilis prevalence as a rate that is below 5%, and high syphilis prevalence as a rate of 5% or above.\nThe interpretation of results and decisions about subsequent treatment regimen, based on recommendations 5, 6, 7 and 8 for the treatment of early and late syphilis in pregnant women  should be specified.\n\n【44】 #SCREENING AND TREATMENT STRATEGIES AND FLOWCHARTS STRATEGY A: SINGLE ON-SITE RST FOLLOWED BY TREATMENT IF POSITIVE\nThe on-site RST can be provided as a single test and treatment provided during the same visit based on the results. The RST does not, however, distinguish between the presence of previously adequately treated syphilis and untreated syphilis. Therefore, pregnant women who test positive on the RST and are treated adequately for syphilis will likely still test positive on a subsequent RST (e.g. during a subsequent pregnancy). Pregnant women who tested positive on a previous RST (e.g. during a previous pregnancy) could therefore be treated again for syphilis without repeating the RST if the risk of re-infection is considered high. Alternatively, a quantitative RPR test could be performed in these women instead of an RST (i.e. to determine the titre).\n\n【45】 #STRATEGY B: SINGLE ON-SITE RPR TEST FOLLOWED BY TREATMENT IF POSITIVE\nThe RPR test in this strategy is provided on-site as a single test and the results are available rapidly such that treatment can be provided the same day. This means that (as with the single on-site RST strategy), a pregnant woman can receive both testing and treatment during the same visit. If the RPR is negative, it can be repeated after approximately one month to obtain a correct (positive) diagnsosis for persons with early syphilis whose first RPR test was still negative. Women with early syphilis will be detectable by RPR test approximately a month after the onset of the primary chancre. Provision of on-site RPR will require a rotator, a blood centrifuge and a refrigerator for reagents, as well as electricity to operate this equipment. In this strategy, an on-site RST (treponemal test) is provided to the pregnant women first. If the result is seronegative, it can be interpreted as no syphilis infection and no treatment or further testing are given. If the on-site RST is positive, immediate treatment should be given to prevent adverse outcomes of pregnancy. A single dose of benzathine penicillin will be sufficient to prevent such adverse outcomes. The woman can then proceed to further testing with an RPR test (which may be conducted on-or off-site, depending on available resources), and if this test is also positive then she should be treated appropriately for syphilis according to the determined duration of her infection . If the duration is less than two years then another dose is not needed, but if the duration is unknown or greater than two years then a second dose is needed a week after the first and a third dose a week later. If the RPR is negative, however, it can be repeated after approximately one month to obtain a correct (positive) diagnosis for persons with early syphilis whose first RPR test was still negative. Women with early syphilis will become detectable by RPR test approximately a month after the onset of the primary chancre. It should be noted that as with Strategy D, this strategy may also require the pregnant woman to make two visits to the clinic if her first test was positive (i.e. to receive the results of the second  test if it was not available on-site and for further treatment if indicated), but in this strategy she will have already received her first test results and first dose of treatment (if positive) on the first visit, whereas with Strategy D she will not receive any test results or treatment on the first visit.\nThe evidence used to develop the recommendations in this guideline came primarily from evidence that was modelled using diagnostic test accuracy data either from field research or published trials, or from studies evaluating the effects of treatments.\nWhile there was evidence from single-test strategies (e.g. rapid syphilis tests  and rapid plasma reagin  tests), there was no evidence for diagnostic test accuracy of a sequence of tests ,e.g. RST followed by RPR. Sequences of tests are of great interest and potential use but more research is needed to determine the real test accuracy of a sequence of tests, as opposed to using modelled test accuracy values.\nThe modelling also allowed for calculation of effects on infant and maternal outcomes, as there were few studies which followed the full path of pregnant women from testing to important outcomes. While follow-up data may be challenging to gather in the context of randomized controlled trials, when the recommendations are implemented in the coming months and years large-scale follow-up of cohorts of patients will provide important information about implementation and the level of success gained through the application of the screening and treatment strategies; in particular, for the strategy of on-site RST followed by first dose of treatment, if positive, and RPR testing followed by second and third doses of treatment, if positive ,i.e In addition, the acceptability of these strategies to pregnant women and health-care providers should be assessed, as well as the feasibility in different settings.\nSince there was little data directly comparing screening to no screening or comparing different test strategies to each other or comparing the effect on patient important outcomes, cost-effectiveness modelling studies were used to provide evidence. For the question comparing screening to no screening, data from a previously published cost-effectiveness analysis were used. 20 The number of infant outcomes was extracted from the model and then presented. For the question comparing different test strategies, the evidence was modelled from test accuracy data and from the calculated effects on patient important outcomes. A published costeffectiveness analysis used: field data for the screening and treatment rates of syphilis in countries with low and high prevalence of syphilis; the sensitivity and specificity of single rapid syphilis tests (RSTs) in the field and from published research; and the effects of treatments. 21 The data used in the analysis were confirmed using another unpublished systematic review of test accuracy data of single RSTs. 22 The outputs of the cost-effectiveness analysis were extracted from the model and presented by test strategy and by outcomes for screening rate, treatment rate, missed cases, over-treatment, and cases treated .\n\n【46】 #EVIDENCE-TO-DECISION FRAMEWORKS\n\n【47】 #MAKING THE RECOMMENDATIONS\nThe evidence was presented and discussed during a second meeting of the GDG in October 2015, which was facilitated by two co-chairs -one with expertise in GRADE and the other with clinical STI expertise Therefore, the recommendations were formulated during subsequent teleconference calls and electronic communications with the GDG working group for syphilis. To formulate the recommendations, the GDG working group for syphilis considered and discussed the desirable and undesirable effects of the interventions, the value placed on the outcomes, the associated costs and use of resources, the acceptability of the interventions to all stakeholders (including people affected by STIs), the impact on health equity and the feasibility of implementation.\nThe methods for the development of the recommendations for syphilis screening for pregnant women are described below.\n- A meeting was held in December 2013, at which the Guideline Development Group (GDG) discussed and decided on the questions to be addressed in the guidelines on syphilis treatment (2016 publication) and on syphilis screening and treatment (this publication), including the specific populations, tests and outcomes. Multiple questions were identified, including different screening/testing strategies, no screening and mass treatment. The questions are framed using the PICO format (population, intervention, comparator and outcomes).\n\n【48】 #SEARCH FOR EVIDENCE FOR EFFECTS OF INTERVENTIONS\nTo avoid duplication of reviews that have been previously published, evidence was searched using a hierarchical approach. The team first searched for synthesized evidence then searched the primary studies for all the factors needed to complete the evidence-todecision framework for each question (i.e. benefits and harms, patient values, acceptability, feasibility, equity and costs).\nThe hierarchical approach consisted of identifying pre-existing synthesized evidence, including from previously published guidelines that included systematic reviews of the literature. We updated the searches of relevant systematic reviews to determine if more recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized studies were available.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Give advice about seeking medical help if symptoms of cellulitis or erysipelas develop.\nFor adults who have had treatment in hospital, or under specialist advice, for at least 2 separate episodes of cellulitis or erysipelas in the previous 12 months, specialists may consider a trial of antibiotic prophylaxis. Involve the person in a shared decision by discussing and taking account of:\nthe severity and frequency of previous symptoms the risk of developing complications underlying conditions (such as oedema, diabetes or venous insufficiency) and their management the person's preference for antibiotic use.\nWhen choosing an antibiotic for prophylaxis , take account of any previous microbiological results and previous antibiotic use.\nWhen antibiotic prophylaxis is given, give advice about:\npossible adverse effects of long-term antibiotics returning for review within 6 months seeking medical help if symptoms of cellulitis or erysipelas recur.\nReview antibiotic prophylaxis for recurrent cellulitis or erysipelas at least every 6 months. The review should include:\nassessing the success of prophylaxis discussing continuing, stopping or changing prophylaxis (taking into account the person's preferences for antibiotic use and the risk of antimicrobial resistance).Stop or change the prophylactic antibiotic to an alternative if cellulitis or erysipelas recurs .\n\n【11】 #Choice of antibiotic prophylaxis\n\n【12】 Prophylaxis\nAntibiotic and dosage\nFirst choice\nChoose antibiotics according to recent microbiological results when possible, and avoid using the same antibiotic for treatment and prophylaxis\nPhenoxymethylpenicillin:\nmg orally twice a day\nAlternative first choice for penicillin allergy\nErythromycin:\nthe BNF for appropriate use and dosing in specific populations, for example, people with hepatic or renal impairment, in pregnancy and breastfeeding.\nFor a short explanation of why the committee made this recommendation, see the summary of the evidence on antibiotic prophylaxis for the prevention of recurrent cellulitis and erysipelas.\n\n【13】 ## Ambulatory care\nClinical care that may include diagnosis, observation, treatment and rehabilitation not provided within the traditional hospital bed base or within the traditional outpatient services that can be provided across primary/secondary care.\n\n【14】 ## Cellulitis and erysipelas\nInfections of the tissues under the skin (subcutaneous), which usually result from contamination of a break in the skin. Both conditions are characterised by acute localised inflammation and oedema, with lesions more superficial in erysipelas with a well-defined, raised margin (World Health Organization, WHO model prescribing information: drugs used in skin diseases, bacterial infections, staphylococcal and streptococcal infections)\n\n【15】 #Summary of the evidence\nThis is a summary of the evidence\n\n【16】 #Managing cellulitis and erysipelas\nCellulitis and erysipelas are infections of the tissues under the skin, which are treated with antibiotics.\nThe main bacteria causing cellulitis and erysipelas are Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus, but infection can also be caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenza, gram-negative bacilli and anaerobes (NICE clinical knowledge summary on cellulitis).\nThe evidence identified in this guideline was for antibiotics compared with other antibiotics for managing non-surgically acquired cellulitis or erysipelas in adults, young people and children. Most studies did not report the site of infection, but where this was reported, most cases had a lower limb infection or less frequently an upper limb infection. One systematic review excluded a study of facial cellulitis.\n\n【17】 ## Committee discussion on managing cellulitis and erysipelas\nThe committee discussed that to ensure the appropriate treatment of cellulitis and erysipelas, it is important to exclude other causes of skin redness (erythema). This can often be caused by an inflammatory reaction, for example, following an immunisation or an insect bite, or any other non-infective cause such as chronic venous insufficiency, which could be wrongly treated as cellulitis or erysipelas.\nThe committee agreed based on experience that to monitor the progression of cellulitis or erysipelas, and help assess the effectiveness of antibiotic treatment, it may be useful to draw around the extent of the infected area using a single-use surgical marker pen before treatment. The committee discussed that a single-use surgical pen should be used because it is designed for this purpose (unlike other pen types that may damage skin or leave permanent marking) and would not risk cross-infection. The committee noted that in people with certain conditions (for example, lymphoedema), drawing around the infected area may be difficult or not possible because the rash may be ill-defined. Additionally, they noted that the extent of redness may be less visible on darker skin tones.\nThe committee agreed that it may take time for antibiotic treatment to take effect, and initially redness or swelling may extend beyond the marked line (if used).\n\n【18】 ## Effectiveness of antibiotics versus other antibiotics in adults\nThere were no differences in the clinical effectiveness of the following antibiotic comparisons in adults with cellulitis or erysipelas:\nan oral penicillin or cephalosporin compared with an oral macrolide or oral clindamycin\n-ral azithromycin compared with oral cefalexin\nintravenous\nIV or oral linezolid compared with IV vancomycin\nIV tigecycline compared with IV ampicillin with sulbactam or IV co‑amoxiclav\nnewer cephalosporins compared with older cephalosporins\nSome differences were seen for some effectiveness outcomes for the following antibiotic comparison in adults with cellulitis or erysipelas:\n-ral macrolides or oral streptogramins .\nBased on 3 systematic reviews .\n\n【19】 ## Effectiveness of antibiotics versus other antibiotics in children\nThere was no difference in the clinical effectiveness of the following antibiotic comparison in children with cellulitis or erysipelas:\nIV linezolid compared with IV vancomycin .\nBased on 1 RCT .\n\n【20】 ## Dual therapy in adults or children\nThere were no differences in the clinical effectiveness of the following antibiotic comparisons in adults or children with cellulitis or erysipelas:\n-ral cefalexin plus oral co‑trimoxazole compared with oral cefalexin alone\nIV then oral flucloxacillin plus IV then oral benzylpenicillin compared with IV then oral flucloxacillin alone\nIV ceftazidime plus IV vancomycin compared with IV ceftobiprole alone .\nBased on 2 systematic reviews .\n\n【21】 ## Safety of antibiotics\nAntibiotic-associated diarrhoea is estimated to occur in 2 to 25% of people taking antibiotics, depending on the antibiotic used (NICE clinical knowledge summary on diarrhoea – antibiotic associated).\nAbout 10% of the general population claim to have a penicillin allergy; this is often because of a skin rash that occurred while taking a course of penicillin as a child. Fewer than 10% of people who think they are allergic to penicillin are truly allergic\nPeople with a history of immediate hypersensitivity to penicillins may also react to cephalosporins and other beta-lactam antibiotics (British national formulary  information on phenoxymethylpenicillin).\nCholestatic jaundice and hepatitis can occur with flucloxacillin up to 2 months after stopping treatment; risk factors are increasing age and use for more than 14 days (BNF information on flucloxacillin).\nMacrolides should be used with caution in people with a predisposition to QT interval prolongation. Nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort and diarrhoea are the most common side effects of macrolides. These are less frequent with clarithromycin than with erythromycin (BNF information on erythromycin).\nTetracyclines (for example, doxycycline), can deposit in growing bone and teeth (by binding to calcium) causing staining and occasionally dental hypoplasia. They should not be given to pregnant or breastfeeding women, and use in children under 12 years is either contraindicated or cautioned for use only in severe or life-threatening infections where there are no alternatives (BNF information on doxycycline).\nClindamycin has been associated with colitis and diarrhoea. Although this can occur with most antibiotics, it is more frequent with clindamycin. Monitoring of liver and renal function is recommended if treatment exceeds 10 days, and in babies (BNF information on clindamycin).\nGlycopeptide (for example, vancomycin and teicoplanin) doses are based on body weight. Therapeutic drug monitoring and monitoring of various patient parameters (including blood count, urinalysis, auditory function, hepatic function and renal function) is recommended depending on the particular glycopeptide (BNF information on vancomycin).\nSevere optic neuropathy can occur with linezolid, particularly if used for longer than 28 days. Blood disorders have also been reported and weekly full blood counts are recommended (BNF information on linezolid).\nthe EMC's summaries of product characteristics for information on contraindications, cautions and adverse effects of individual medicines.\nData on adverse events in the included studies were limited because of cellulitis or erysipelas often being a subgroup in larger skin and skin structure infection studies, where adverse event data were presented for the whole study and not cellulitis or erysipelas subgroups.\nThere were no differences in the adverse events of the following antibiotic comparisons in adults or children with cellulitis or erysipelas:\n-ral cefazolin compared with IV ceftriaxone\nIV daptomycin compared with IV vancomycin .\nSome differences were seen for some adverse event outcomes for the following antibiotic comparisons in adults or children with cellulitis or erysipelas:\nflucloxacillin plus clindamycin was significantly worse for adverse events\nIV penicillin was significantly worse for adverse events .\nBased on 2 systematic reviews .\nThe committee noted that most antibiotics compared with another antibiotic showed no difference in clinical outcomes in adults or children. The committee also noted that dual therapy was no more effective than single antibiotic therapy in adults. Adverse event data were very limited and there were no differences in adverse events between most of the antibiotic comparisons. Given the very limited amount of evidence in children, the committee agreed that antibiotic choice for children can be extrapolated from the choice for adults.\nThe committee agreed based on their experience that choice of antibiotic treatment should be based on the severity of symptoms and the risk of developing complications, while minimising the risk of the development of antibiotic resistance.\nThe committee agreed based on the evidence, their experience and resistance data that the first-choice oral antibiotic should be flucloxacillin (a relatively narrow-spectrum penicillin). The committee discussed that flucloxacillin has activity against Staphylococcus aureus (because it is not inactivated by penicillinases produced by staphylococci) and Streptococcus pyogenes. They also agreed that this would be the first-choice antibiotic for people with recurrent infection, because the risk of resistance to flucloxacillin is very low. The only exception would be people with a suspected or confirmed meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection, but the committee discussed that the likelihood of such a cellulitis or erysipelas infection with MRSA is very low. The committee agreed that flucloxacillin has poor oral bioavailability and in people with cellulitis or erysipelas who could have impaired circulation (such as people with diabetes or venous insufficiency), a higher (off label) dose of up to 1 g four times a day may be needed to adequately treat the infection. The committee were aware that a narrow-spectrum penicillin with a specific antistreptococcal penicillin is sometimes prescribed for cases of cellulitis or erysipelas, because these infections can involve either streptococci or staphylococci, but there is no evidence that dual therapy is more effective than, for example, flucloxacillin alone. Additionally, the committee considered that dual therapy may increase the risk of antimicrobial resistance and adverse effects.\nBased on evidence, their experience and resistance data, the committee also agreed to recommend the following alternative antibiotics for people with severe infection:\ncefuroxime clindamycin ceftriaxone (in adults for ambulatory care only).They discussed that other antibiotics may also be appropriate, particularly in ambulatory care for specific people or populations, and prescribers should seek specialist, local advice.\nIn cases of suspected or confirmed MRSA infection, vancomycin, teicoplanin or if these cannot be used, for specialist use, linezolid, were recommended. They also noted that other antibiotics may be appropriate based on microbiological results and specialist advice.\n\n【22】 #Antibiotic dose frequency\nThere was no difference in the clinical effectiveness of the following antibiotic comparison in adults with cellulitis or erysipelas:\n-ral cefalexin four times a day compared with twice a day, using the same total daily dose.\nBased on 1 systematic review .\nNo systematic reviews or randomised controlled trials in children met the inclusion criteria.\n\n【23】 #Antibiotic course length\nThere were no differences in the clinical effectiveness of the following antibiotic comparisons in adults with cellulitis:\n-ral tedizolid for 6 days compared with 10 days\nBased on 2 systematic reviews .\nNo systematic reviews or randomised controlled trials in children met the inclusion criteria.\n\n【24】 #Antibiotic route of administration\nThere were no differences in the clinical effectiveness of the following antibiotic comparisons in adults with cellulitis:\n-ral cefalexin or oral clindamycin compared with IV cefazolin or IV clindamycin\nIV benzylpenicillin compared with intramuscular benzylpenicillin .\nBased on 1 systematic review .\nNo systematic reviews or randomised controlled trials in children met the inclusion criteria.\n\n【25】 ## Committee discussion on antibiotic dose frequency, course length and route of administration\nThe committee acknowledged that there was very limited evidence identified for antibiotic dose frequency.\nBased on limited evidence and their experience, the committee agreed that a shorter course of antibiotics was generally as effective as a longer course of antibiotics for cellulitis or erysipelas, and a 5- to 7‑day course was sufficient for most people. However, the committee noted that only 1 RCT  used flucloxacillin for 5 days and the authors expressed doubts about the quality of their data for dose and duration. Therefore, the committee discussed that the decision of whether a 5‑day or a 7‑day course was given would be based on clinical judgement of individual cases. The committee discussed that a longer course (up to 14 days in total) may be needed for some people based on a clinical assessment of their symptoms and history. However, skin does take some time to return to normal, even after an effective course of antibiotics, and a full resolution of symptoms at 5 to 7 days would not be expected.\nBased on limited evidence, the committee agreed that oral antibiotics were as effective as intravenous antibiotics for treating cellulitis and erysipelas.\nIn line with the NICE guideline on antimicrobial stewardship and Public Health England's Start smart – then focus, the committee agreed that oral antibiotics should be used in preference to intravenous antibiotics where possible. Intravenous antibiotics should only be used for people who are severely ill, unable to tolerate oral treatment, or where oral treatment would not provide adequate coverage or tissue penetration.\nThe use of intravenous antibiotics should be reviewed by 48 hours (taking into account the person's response to treatment and any microbiological results) and switched to oral treatment where possible, for a total of 5 to 7 days. Again, a longer course (up to 14 days in total) may be needed for some people based on clinical assessment.\n\n【26】 #Antibiotic prophylaxis for the prevention of recurrent cellulitis and erysipelas\nAntibiotic prophylaxis (with an intramuscular or oral penicillin, or oral erythromycin) significantly lowered the risk of recurrence of cellulitis or erysipelas compared with no treatment or placebo in a meta-analysis of 5 RCTs in adults (approximately 46 to 70 years) with 1 or 2 previous episodes of cellulitis or erysipelas in the past 3 months to 3 years depending on the RCT.\nAntibiotic prophylaxis was not significantly different to no treatment or placebo for mortality or risk of hospitalisation in adults with 1 or 2 previous episodes of cellulitis or erysipelas.\nThere were no differences in the adverse events of antibiotic prophylaxis compared with no treatment or placebo in adults with cellulitis or erysipelas.\nBased on 1 systematic review .\nNo systematic reviews or randomised controlled trials in children met the inclusion criteria.\n\n【27】 ## Committee discussion on antibiotic prophylaxis of recurrent cellulitis or erysipelas\nThe committee noted that recurrence is not uncommon in people who have had cellulitis or erysipelas. The committee also noted the limitations of the evidence for antibiotic prophylaxis, which was in adults only and mainly related to lower limb cellulitis. There was variation in the populations in the included studies for the number of previous episodes (1 or 2) and the time periods over which recurrence was defined (up to 3 years).\nThe committee agreed based on evidence and experience that antibiotic prophylaxis should not be routinely offered to prevent recurrent cellulitis or erysipelas because of the balance of risks and benefits in the overall population.\nHowever, they agreed based on evidence and experience that a trial of antibiotic prophylaxis could be considered for a higher-risk population, which the committee defined as adults who have had at least 2 separate episodes of cellulitis or erysipelas in the previous 12 months, which were managed in hospital, or where the care was under specialist advice. The populations in the antibiotic prophylaxis trials were more varied (having 1 or 2 previous episodes over up to 3 years), but the committee wanted to ensure that prophylaxis would only be considered for those at highest risk.\nTo reduce the risk of antimicrobial resistance, the committee agreed that each review should include a discussion around the success of prophylaxis and whether antibiotics should be continued, stopped or changed, taking into account the person's preferences for antibiotic use and the potential risk of antimicrobial resistance with long-term use of antibiotics. If treatment failure occurs and cellulitis or erysipelas recurs, the committee agreed that antibiotic prophylaxis should be stopped or changed to an alternative prophylactic antibiotic once the acute infection has been treated.\nNo recommendation for antibiotic prophylaxis in children was made because there was no evidence in this population\n\n【28】 #Other considerations\n\n【29】 #Medicines adherence\nMedicines adherence may be a problem for some people taking antibiotics that need frequent dosing or longer treatment duration .\n\n【30】 implications\nRecommended antibiotics are available as generic formulations.

It is only recommended if the company provides trifluridine–tipiracil according to the commercial arrangement.\nWhy the committee made these recommendations\nThis evaluation uses new cost-effectiveness estimates to update trifluridine–tipiracil for treating metastatic gastric cancer or gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma after 2 or more therapies (NICE technology appraisal guidance TA669). No new clinical evidence was reviewed.\nStandard treatment for metastatic gastric cancer and gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma, for most people who have had 2 or more treatments, is best supportive care.\nThe clinical evidence suggests that people having trifluridine–tipiracil live longer compared with best supportive care. When taking into account the severity of the condition and its effect on quality and length of life, the most likely cost-effectiveness estimate is within the range that NICE normally considers an acceptable use of NHS resources. So, trifluridine–tipiracil is recommended\n\n【3】 #Information about trifluridine–tipiracil\n\n【4】 #Marketing authorisation indication\nTrifluridine–tipiracil (Lonsurf, Servier) is indicated for 'monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic gastric cancer including adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction, who have been previously treated with at least 2 prior systemic treatment regimens for advanced disease'.\n\n【5】 #Dosage in the marketing authorisation\nThe dosage schedule is available in the summary of product characteristics for trifluridine–tipiracil.\n\n【6】 The list price of trifluridine–tipiracil is £500 per pack of 20 tablets containing 15 mg of trifluridine and 6.14 mg of tipiracil, and £666.67 per pack of 20 tablets containing 20 mg of trifluridine and 8.19 mg of tipiracil (excluding VAT; BNF online, accessed October 2022).\nThe company has a commercial arrangement. This makes trifluridine–tipiracil available to the NHS with a discount. The size of the discount is commercial in confidenc\n\n【7】 #Committee discussion\nThe evaluation committee considered evidence submitted by Servier, a review of this submission by the external assessment group (EAG) and responses from stakeholders for the original appraisal. New cost-effectiveness estimates were submitted by Servier and considered for this update of NICE's technology appraisal guidance on trifluridine–tipiracil for treating metastatic gastric cancer or gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma after 2 or more therapies (TA669)\nUnless otherwise indicated, gastric cancer refers to both gastric cancer and gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma.\n\n【8】 ## Treatment options\nThe initial symptoms of gastric cancer are vague and similar to other stomach conditions, but for advanced disease they may include lack of appetite, weight loss, fluid in the abdomen and blood in the stool. The clinical experts estimated that life expectancy after 2 previous treatments is between 2 and 4 months in current practice. They explained that there is no standard treatment for previously treated metastatic gastric cancer but in clinical practice in the NHS in England, treatment is usually in line with the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) guideline for gastric cancer. The clinical experts advised that paclitaxel is generally used after 1 treatment, and irinotecan may be used after 2 treatments but for most people it is not appropriate because of the risk of side effects. They estimated that third-line chemotherapy is used in about 10% of people, with most people having best supportive care alone. The committee was aware that the ESMO guideline had recently been updated to recommend trifluridine–tipiracil as a third-line treatment option for people with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score of 0 or 1. The committee noted that there was no patient expert submission for this appraisal, but the clinical experts explained that maintaining health-related quality of life is very important to people with metastatic gastric cancer. They advised that an oral treatment such as trifluridine–tipiracil would be preferred because it does not need many hospital visits, allowing people to spend more time at home. The committee concluded that there is an unmet need for third-line treatment options for gastric cancer.\n\n【9】 ## Comparators\nThe company submitted cost-effectiveness analyses comparing trifluridine–tipiracil and best supportive care with placebo and best supportive care. It advised that there is a lack of evidence to support the use of third-line chemotherapy and that its expert advice suggested this is usually restricted to clinical trials. The committee recalled that third-line chemotherapy is appropriate but is used in only a small proportion of people in current practice, with most people having best supportive care alone . The clinical experts explained that although there is no clear definition of best supportive care, it usually includes treatments to control symptoms such as pain. The committee concluded that the most appropriate comparator is best supportive care.\n\n【10】 ## Clinical trial evidence and generalisability\nThe clinical evidence for trifluridine–tipiracil came from TAGS, a phase 3 randomised controlled trial. It compared trifluridine–tipiracil and best supportive care with placebo and best supportive care in 507 adults with metastatic gastric cancer (including 29% with gastro-oesophageal junction cancer) who had had at least 2 treatments for advanced disease, and who had an ECOG performance score of 0 or 1. The committee was aware of several issues that may impact the generalisability of the full intention-to-treat analysis from TAGS to the NHS in England:\nOf the full intention-to-treat population, 33% had had ramucirumab but this treatment is not available in the NHS in England . The clinical experts explained that the subgroup of people who had not had ramucirumab is more likely to represent the population in the NHS in England. But they advised that having previous ramucirumab is not likely to affect the relative treatment effect of trifluridine–tipiracil.\nOf the full intention-to-treat population, 14% were from Japan. Census data in England and Wales suggest about 1.5% of people are categorised as 'other Asian', which is likely to include people from Japan. The EAG explained that in TAGS, patients from Japan had a longer median overall survival (6.3 months for trifluridine–tipiracil and 5.9 months for best supportive care) compared with people from other parts of the world (median overall survival 5.4 months for trifluridine–tipiracil and 3.3 months for best supportive care). It suggested that possible reasons for this are biological factors and differences in the treatment pathway.There were 63% of the full intention-to-treat population who had had 3 or more previous treatments. The clinical experts expected this to be less than 5% in clinical practice in England.In its original submission, the company used data from a subgroup of people from TAGS who had not had ramucirumab. The company highlighted that this subgroup included fewer people from Japan and fewer people who had 3 or more previous treatments than the full intention-to-treat population (the exact data are confidential and cannot be reported here). The committee noted that this subgroup still included a higher proportion of people from Japan than would be expected in England, which may make it less generalisable to NHS practice. In response to consultation, the company provided analyses using TAGS subgroup data from people who had had exactly 2 previous treatments (the third-line subgroup). The company stated that this subgroup represented most people who would have trifluridine–tipiracil in clinical practice. One analysis included data for people from all trial locations, while the other restricted the data to only include people who lived in Europe. The committee agreed that the data restricted to people who lived in Europe were likely to be generalisable to NHS practice. These data still provide a large enough sample size for robust analysis. It concluded that the third-line, European subgroup data from TAGS was acceptable for decision making.\n\n【11】 ## Propensity score analysis\nThe EAG advised that the committee's preferred third-line, European subgroup  had imbalances in patient characteristics between the 2 arms of the TAGS trial. Some of these could favour survival after treatment with trifluridine–tipiracil and some could favour survival after treatment with placebo (the exact numbers are confidential and cannot be reported here). The company accepted that any subgroup analysis may be at risk of imbalances in characteristics, but it felt there were no imbalances in verified prognostic factors in this analysis. After the second meeting, the committee requested additional analyses to adjust the third-line data for imbalances in:\nperitoneal metastases\nECOG performance status intestinal or non-intestinal histology previous treatment with irinotecan, and region (not included in the Europe-only analysis).The EAG found the company's propensity score-based analyses reasonable, but noted that some uncertainty remained. This was because it was not clear whether all relevant characteristics had been included in the model. The committee understood that trifluridine–tipiracil improved overall survival compared with placebo and best supportive care in all unadjusted analyses. The company's adjusted analyses showed similar overall survival results (the exact data are confidential and cannot be reported here). The company explained that this was because of the small sample size and the 5 selected characteristics having opposing effects. The committee agreed that the company's rationale was acceptable, but there was still some uncertainty about whether all relevant factors were included in the analysis. However, the committee concluded that the adjusted analysis was acceptable, and took the uncertainty into account in its decision making.\n\n【12】 ## Company's modelling approach\nThe company included a partitioned survival cost-effectiveness model in its evidence submission. The model comprised 3 health states representing progression-free disease, progressed disease and death. Health-state occupancy over time was informed by survival functions from TAGS data. The EAG advised that the model was generally clear and appropriate. The committee concluded that the company's model was suitable for decision making.\n\n【13】 ## Neutropenia\nIn TAGS, the most common side effects included nausea, anaemia, decreased appetite, vomiting, diarrhoea, fatigue, neutropenia, asthenia and thrombocytopenia. Anaemia was considerably more common in the trifluridine–tipiracil group than the placebo group (45% compared with 19%). Neutropenia was also more common (53% compared with 4%). The company included adverse events such as neutropenia in the model to capture their effect on health-related quality of life. The committee noted that in the summary of product characteristics for trifluridine–tipiracil, neutropenia was one of the most common side effects that led to treatment being stopped, delayed or interrupted. It concluded that neutropenia may affect health-related quality of life.\n\n【14】 ## Overall survival extrapolation\nThe company extrapolated overall survival in both treatment arms using an accelerated failure time model, which included a dependent variable to capture the effect of treatment. This approach assumes that the relative treatment effect is constant over time. In its base-case analysis the company used a log-normal function that was applied for the entire duration of the model. The EAG explained that the Kaplan−Meier estimates from the intention-to-treat population, new analyses at consultation and analyses in the committee's preferred population (the third-line, European subgroup) all showed that trifluridine–tipiracil survival either crossed or almost converged with best supportive care survival. This indicates that the treatment effect was not constant over time. The committee heard that because of this, the EAG preferred separate functions that were fitted independently to each treatment arm. This had little difference in statistical fit compared with the dependent models. The company maintained its preference for the dependent model in its base-case analysis but accepted that other approaches may also be valid. The committee concluded that the model should use survival functions fitted independently to each trial arm to extrapolate overall survival.\n\n【15】 ## Full log-normal survival function\nThe company used a log-normal function to extrapolate overall survival for the entire duration of the model in its base-case analysis. The clinical experts predicted that 20% to 25% of people survive to 6 months in current practice, which reduces to 10% to 15% at 1 year. The committee noted exploratory analyses that modelled overall survival using the relatively mature Kaplan−Meier estimates for the first 12 or 18 months of the model, then applied a parametric function to extrapolate beyond each timepoint. The EAG advised that using the Kaplan−Meier estimates was problematic because the timepoint when the observed data was replaced by the parametric function was arbitrary. Also, the available parametric functions had been estimated using the full duration of trial data rather than the end portion. The committee noted that the EAG's preferred method for extrapolating the overall survival was a parametric model used for the entire time horizon. It concluded that a full log-normal function was most plausible, and should be considered for decision making.\n\n【16】 ## Generalised gamma and Kaplan−Meier analysis\nThe company's revised base-case analysis, using the committee's preferred approach  used a generalised gamma function to model treatment duration, fitted to the adjusted TAGS third-line European subgroup. The committee noted that the Kaplan−Meier estimates showed that no patients were having trifluridine–tipiracil at 1 year. At the third meeting, the company confirmed that there were no other data on treatment duration for this population with metastatic gastric cancer. It also clarified that in the full TAGS population, the maximum time on trifluridine–tipiracil was around 1.2 years, indicating that very few people would be expected to remain on treatment for a long time. The EAG explained that it preferred to use an extrapolated function, rather than the Kaplan−Meier estimates, to better reflect uncertainty in the data. This is because in clinical practice there may be a small number of people who do stay on treatment for a long time, but this was not reflected in the Kaplan−Meier estimates. The EAG advised that the generalised gamma function was reasonable, but other parametric functions could not be ruled out based on their statistical fit to the data, including some that predicted more people having long-term treatment. The committee agreed that people are unlikely to remain on treatment with trifluridine–tipiracil for very long, and so functions with long tails were not appropriate. It agreed that the generalised gamma function was acceptable for decision making, but noted that using the Kaplan−Meier estimates may also be plausible.\n\n【17】 #f utility values\nThe company's base-case utility values were 0.764 for the progression-free health state and 0.652 for progressed disease. These values came from TAGS data on EORTC QLQ‑C30. This is a disease-specific measure, mapped onto the generic EQ‑5D‑3L scale using an algorithm from a small Greek study that included people with non-metastatic gastric cancer. The committee was aware that at the clarification stage, the company did not provide cost-effectiveness results using alternative mapping studies from Versteegh et al.  or Longworth et al. as requested by the EAG. The company clarified that this was because neither study was in gastric cancer and Versteegh et al.  did not use the UK value set. The committee noted that the company's preferred utility values were higher than those used in NICE's technology appraisal guidance on ramucirumab, particularly for progressed disease (0.652 compared with 0.587). The utility values in that appraisal were based on EQ‑5D data from a trial (RAINBOW) and included people with metastatic disease after 1 previous treatment. The company did not consider those utility values appropriate because they did not account for correlation between utility scores for the same patient over time. The committee noted that the preferred utility values in the ramucirumab appraisal included data from multiple timepoints for the progression-free health state but not for progressed disease. The clinical experts advised that, in their opinion, the most appropriate data source would be the population from the TAGS trial who had at least 2 previous treatments, no previous treatment with ramucirumab and had good performance status. The committee concluded that the company's mapped utility values from TAGS were acceptable for decision making.\n\n【18】 ## Carer quality of life\nAt consultation, the company highlighted a Turkish study of 72 patients with gastric cancer and 72 caregivers. This reported improvement in the carers' quality of life after a nursing care intervention. The company noted that the benefit for carers and families from delaying disease progression with trifluridine–tipiracil was not captured in its model. However, the committee concluded that there was no evidence that the quality-of-life gain would be significant and so carer quality-of-life improvement should not be considered in the model.\n\n【19】 ## Highest QALY weighting\nFor this update, the company provided evidence that metastatic gastric cancer after 2 or more treatments is a severe condition. The severity modifier allows the committee to give more weight to health benefits in the most severe conditions. The company provided absolute and proportional quality-adjusted life year (QALY) shortfall estimates in line with NICE's health technology evaluations manual. Absolute QALY shortfall is the future health that is lost by people living with a condition, including quality and length of life, compared with the expected future health of people without the condition over their remaining lifetime. Proportional QALY shortfall represents the proportion of future health that is lost by people living with the condition, including quality and length of life. The company provided evidence for the committee's preferred population, the third-line European subgroup from the TAGS trial . This population had a mean age of 62 and was 33.3% female. People with these characteristics without metastatic gastric cancer after 2 or more treatments would be expected to gain 11.69 QALYs. The company's model estimated that people with metastatic gastric cancer after 2 or more treatments who have best supportive care would be expected to gain 0.37 QALYs. The company used these estimates to calculate an absolute QALY shortfall of 11.3 and a proportional QALY shortfall of 0.97. The committee considered the advice about severity as a decision modifier, which allows it to apply a greater weight to the QALYs for technologies indicated for conditions with a high degree of severity. It noted that if either the absolute or the proportional QALY shortfall calculated falls on the cut-off between severity levels, the higher severity level will apply. The company stated that although the absolute QALY shortfall was less than 12, which would imply no QALY weight, the proportional QALY shortfall of 0.97 implies the highest QALY weight of 1.7. The EAG confirmed that the company's analyses had been implemented correctly and supported the use of the 1.7 QALY weight. The committee noted that uncertainty around inputs had not been fully explored. But it recognised that uncertainty had been explored in the original appraisal and that the new analyses were based on its preferred assumptions. So, the committee concluded that the highest severity weight of 1.7 applied to the QALYs was appropriate.\n\n【20】 ## Company cost-effectiveness estimates\nThe company's updated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for trifluridine–tipiracil compared with best supportive care for the third-line European subgroup was £29,347 per QALY gained, including the confidential commercial discount for trifluridine–tipiracil and a 1.7 QALY severity weight . The committee noted that this analysis was based on its preferred assumptions, including the third-line European subgroup and the generalised gamma function for extrapolating trifluridine–tipiracil treatment duration. The committee concluded that the most plausible cost-effectiveness result was less than £30,000 per QALY gained.\n\n【21】 ## Recommended for routine use\nThe committee considered that the acceptable decision-making threshold was £20,000 to £30,000 per QALY gained. The committee concluded that the most plausible ICER based on its preferred assumptions, was less than £30,000 per QALY gained. Therefore, trifluridine–tipiracil is recommended for routine use in the NHS.\n\n【22】 ## Innovation\nThe committee recalled the poor prognosis for people with metastatic gastric cancer and that there is an unmet need for treatment options after 2 or more treatments . The company considered trifluridine–tipiracil to be innovative because it provides an alternative oral treatment option that increases overall survival. The committee recalled that trifluridine–tipiracil was clinically effective compared with best supportive care , but it had not seen evidence of additional benefits that were not captured in the model. It concluded that all relevant benefits had been captured in the cost-effectiveness estimates.\n\n【23】 ## Equality issues\nThe committee understood that no equalities issues were raised during scoping and technical engagement. It also noted that no potential equality issues were identified in the company submission. The committee concluded that no equalities issues were identified relevant to the recommendation.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

The capsules are stable for 36 months under such refrigeration conditions.\n- Procedures for proper handling and disposal of anticancer drugs should be considered. Several guidelines on this subject have been published1-8. There is no general agreement that all of the procedures recommended in the guidelines are necessary or appropriate.\n\n【3】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Etoposide (oral) in adult patients.\n\n【4】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Etoposide (oral) in adult patients.\n\n【5】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Pediatric)\nThere is limited information regarding FDA-Labeled Use of Etoposide (oral) in pediatric patients.\n\n【6】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Etoposide (oral) in pediatric patients.\n\n【7】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Etoposide (oral) in pediatric patients.\n\n【8】 #Contraindications\n- Etoposide capsules are contraindicated in patients who have demonstrated a previous hypersensitivity to etoposide or any component of the formulation.\n\n【9】 - Patients being treated with etoposide must be frequently observed for myelosuppression both during and after therapy. Myelosuppression resulting in death has been reported. Dose-limiting bone marrow suppression is the most significant toxicity associated with etoposide therapy. Therefore, the following studies should be obtained at the start of therapy and prior to each subsequent cycle of etoposide: platelet count, hemoglobin, white blood cell count and differential. The occurrence of a platelet count below 50,000/mm3 or an absolute neutrophil count below 500/mm3 is an indication to withhold further therapy until the blood counts have sufficiently recovered.\n- Etoposide can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Etoposide has been shown to be teratogenic in mice and rats.\n- In rats, an intravenous etoposide dose of 0.4 mg/kg/day (about 1/20th of the human dose on a mg/m2 basis) during organogenesis caused maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity, and teratogenicity (skeletal abnormalities, exencephaly, encephalocele and anophthalmia); higher doses of 1.2 and 3.6 mg/kg/day (about 1/7th and 1/2 of human dose on a mg/m2 basis) resulted in 90% and 100% embryonic resorptions. In mice, a single 1.0 mg/kg (1/16th of human dose on a mg/m2 basis) dose of etoposide administered intraperitoneally on days 6, 7 or 8 of gestation caused embryotoxicity, cranial abnormalities, and major skeletal malformations. An I.P. dose of 1.5 mg/kg (about 1/10th of human dose on a mg/m2 basis) on day 7 of gestation caused an increase in the incidence of intrauterine death and fetal malformations and a significant decrease in the average fetal body weight.\nWomen of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while receiving this drug, the patient should be warned of the potential hazard to the fetus.\nEtoposide should be considered a potential carcinogen in humans. The occurrence of acute leukemia with or without a preleukemic phase has been reported in rare instances in patients treated with etoposide alone or in association with other neoplastic agents. The risk of development of a preleukemic or leukemic syndrome is unclear. Carcinogenicity tests with etoposide have not been conducted in laboratory animals.\n\n【10】 ## Clinical Trials Experience\n- The following data on adverse reactions are based on both oral and intravenous administration of etoposide as a single agent, using several different dose schedules for treatment of a wide variety of malignancies.\n- Myelosuppression is dose related and dose limiting, with granulocyte nadirs occurring 7 to 14 days after drug administration and platelet nadirs occurring 9 to 16 days after drug administration. Bone marrow recovery is usually complete by day 20, and no cumulative toxicity has been reported. Fever and infection have also been reported in patients with neutropenia. Death associated with myelosuppression has been reported.\n- Transient hypotension following rapid intravenous administration has been reported in 1% to 2% of patients. It has not been associated with cardiac toxicity or electrocardiographic changes. No delayed hypotension has been noted. To prevent this rare occurrence, it is recommended that etoposide be administered by slow intravenous infusion over a 30- to 60-minute period. If hypotension occurs, it usually responds to cessation of the infusion and administration of fluids or other supportive therapy as appropriate. When restarting the infusion, a slower administration rate should be used.\n- Facial/tongue swelling, coughing, diaphoresis, cyanosis, tightness in throat, laryngospasm, back pain and/or loss of consciousness have sometimes occurred in association with the above reactions. In addition, an apparent hypersensitivity-associated apnea has been reported rarely.\n- Rash, urticaria, and/or pruritus have infrequently been reported at recommended doses. At investigational doses, a generalized pruritic erythematous maculopapular rash, consistent with perivasculitis, has been reported.\n- Reversible alopecia, sometimes progressing to total baldness, was observed in up to 66% of patients.\n- The following adverse reactions have been infrequently reported: abdominal pain, aftertaste, constipation, dysphagia, asthenia, fatigue, malaise, somnolence, transient cortical blindness, optic neuritis, interstitial pneumonitis/pulmonary fibrosis, fever, seizure (occasionally associated with allergic reactions), Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis, pigmentation, and a single report of radiation recall dermatitis.\n- Hepatic toxicity, generally in patients receiving higher doses of the drug than those recommended, has been reported with etoposide. Metabolic acidosis has also been reported in patients receiving higher doses.\n\n【11】 ## Postmarketing Experience\nThere is limited information regarding Postmarketing Experience of Etoposide (oral) in the drug label.\n\n【12】 #Drug Interactions\nThere is limited information regarding Etoposide (oral) Drug Interactions in the drug label.\n\n【13】 ### Pregnancy\nPregnancy Category (FDA): D\n- Pregnancy Category\n- Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) Pregnancy Category\nThere is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Etoposide (oral) in women who are pregnant.\n\n【14】 ### Labor and Delivery\nThere is no FDA guidance on use of Etoposide (oral) during labor and delivery.\n\n【15】 ### Nursing Mothers\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Etoposide (oral) with respect to nursing mothers.\n\n【16】 ### Pediatric Use\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Etoposide (oral) with respect to pediatric patients.\n\n【17】 ### Geriatic Use\n- Of more than 600 patients in four clinical studies in the NDA databases who received etoposide or etoposide phosphate in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of small cell lung cancer (SCLC), about one-third were older than 65 years. When advanced age was determined to be a prognostic factor for response or survival in these studies, comparisons between treatment groups were performed for the elderly subset. In the one study (etoposide in combination with cyclophosphamide and vincristine compared with cyclophosphamide and vincristine or cyclophosphamide, vincristine and doxorubicin) where age was a significant prognostic factor for survival, a survival benefit for elderly patients was observed for the etoposide regimen compared with the control regimens. No differences in myelosuppression were seen between elderly and younger patients in these studies except for an increased frequency of WHO Grade III or IV leukopenia among elderly patients in a study of etoposide phosphate or etoposide in combination with cisplatin. Elderly patients in this study also had more anorexia, mucositis, dehydration, somnolence and elevated BUN levels than younger patients.\n- In five single-agent studies of etoposide phosphate in patients with a variety of tumor types, 34% of patients were age 65 years or more. WHO Grade III or IV leukopenia, granulocytopenia and asthenia were more frequent among elderly patients.\n- Post-marketing experience also suggests that elderly patients may be more sensitive to some of the known adverse effects of etoposide, including myelosuppression, gastrointestinal effects, infectious complications and alopecia.\n- Although some minor differences in pharmacokinetic parameters between elderly and nonelderly patients have been observed, these differences were not considered clinically significant.\n- Etoposide and its metabolites are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.\n\n【18】 ### Gender\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Etoposide (oral) with respect to specific gender populations.\n\n【19】 ### Race\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Etoposide (oral) with respect to specific racial populations.\n\n【20】 ### Renal Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Etoposide (oral) in patients with renal impairment.\n\n【21】 ### Hepatic Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Etoposide (oral) in patients with hepatic impairment.\n\n【22】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Etoposide (oral) in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n\n【23】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\nThere is no FDA guidance one the use of Etoposide (oral) in patients who are immunocompromised.\n\n【24】 ### Administration\n- Oral\n\n【25】 ### Monitoring\nThere is limited information regarding Monitoring of Etoposide (oral) in the drug label.\n\n【26】 #IV Compatibility\nThere is limited information regarding IV Compatibility of Etoposide (oral) in the drug label.\n\n【27】 #Overdosage\nNo proven antidotes have been established for etoposide overdosage.\n\n【28】 ## Pharmacodynamics\nThere is limited information regarding Pharmacodynamics of Etoposide (oral) in the drug label.\n\n【29】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n- On intravenous administration, the disposition of etoposide is best described as a biphasic process with a distribution half-life of about 1.5 hours and terminal elimination half-life ranging from 4 to 11 hours. Total body clearance values range from 33 to 48 mL/min or 16 to 36 mL/min/m2 and, like the terminal elimination half-life, are independent of dose over a range 100 to 600 mg/m2. Over the same dose range, the areas under the plasma concentration vs. time curves (AUC) and the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) values increase linearly with dose. Etoposide does not accumulate in the plasma following daily administration of 100 mg/m2 for 4 to 5 days.\n- The mean volumes of distribution at steady-state fall in the range of 18 to 29 liters or 7 to 17 L/m2. Etoposide enters the CSF poorly. Although it is detectable in CSF and intracerebral tumors, the concentrations are lower than in extracerebral tumors and in plasma. Etoposide concentrations are higher in normal lung than in lung metastases and are similar in primary tumors and normal tissues of the myometrium. In vitro, etoposide is highly protein bound (97%) to human plasma proteins. An inverse relationship between plasma albumin levels and etoposide renal clearance is found in children. In a study determining the effect of other therapeutic agents on the in vitro binding of 14C-etoposide to human serum proteins, only phenylbutazone, sodium salicylate and aspirin displaced protein bound etoposide at concentrations achieved in vivo.\n- Etoposide binding ratio correlates directly with serum albumin in patients with cancer and in normal volunteers. The unbound fraction of etoposide significantly correlated with bilirubin in a population of cancer patients. Data have suggested a significant inverse correlation between serum albumin concentration and free fraction of etoposide .\n- After intravenous administration of 14C-etoposide (100 to 124 mg/m2), mean recovery of radioactivity in the urine was 56% of the dose at 120 hours, 45% of which was excreted as etoposide; fecal recovery of radioactivity was 44% of the dose at 120 hours.\n- In children, approximately 55% of the dose is excreted in the urine as etoposide in 24 hours. The mean renal clearance of etoposide is 7 to 10 mL/min/m2 or about 35% of the total body clearance over a dose range of 80 to 600 mg/m2. Etoposide, therefore, is cleared by both renal and nonrenal processes, i.e. metabolism and biliary excretion. The effect of renal disease on plasma etoposide clearance is not known.\n- After either intravenous infusion or oral capsule administration, the Cmax and AUC values exhibit marked intra- and inter-subject variability. This results in variability in the estimates of the absolute oral bioavailability of etoposide oral capsules.\n- Cmax and AUC values for orally administered etoposide capsules consistently fall in the same range as the Cmax and AUC values for an intravenous dose of one-half the size of the oral dose. The overall mean value of oral capsule bioavailability is approximately 50% (range 25% to 75%). The bioavailability of etoposide capsules appears to be linear up to a dose of at least 250 mg/m2.\n- In adults, the total body clearance of etoposide is correlated with creatinine clearance, serum albumin concentration and nonrenal clearance. Patients with impaired renal function receiving etoposide have exhibited reduced total body clearance, increased AUC and a lower volume of distribution at steady-state . Use of cisplatin therapy is associated with reduced total body clearance. In children, elevated serum SGPT levels are associated with reduced drug total body clearance. Prior use of cisplatin may also result in a decrease of etoposide total body clearance in children.\n- Although some minor differences in pharmacokinetic parameters between age and gender have been observed, these differences were not considered clinically significant.\n\n【30】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\nThere is limited information regarding Nonclinical Toxicology of Etoposide (oral) in the drug label.\n\n【31】 #Clinical Studies\nThere is limited information regarding Clinical Studies of Etoposide (oral) in the drug label.\n\n【32】 #How Supplied\n- Etoposide Capsules, USP are available containing 50 mg of etoposide, USP.\n- The 50 mg capsule is an opaque dark pink soft gelatin capsule printed with E50 in black ink.

Parkinson Canada undertook to update the existing guideline to reflect these advances, as well as to add information on palliative care. With the aim of enhancing care for all Canadians with Parkinson disease, this guideline is based on the best published evidence, involves expert consensus when there is a lack of evidence, offers practical clinical advice, takes patient choice and informed decision-making into account and is relevant to the Canadian health care system. The guideline has been divided into 5 main sections to improve the ease of use: communication, diagnosis and progression, treatment, nonmotor features and palliative care.\n- Advanced therapies like deep brain stimulation and intrajejunal levodopa-carbidopa gel infusion are now routinely used in Parkinson disease to manage motor symptoms and fluctuations.\n- Evidence exists to support early institution of exercise at the time of diagnosis of Parkinson disease, in addition to the clear benefit now shown in those with well-established disease.\n- Palliative care requirements of people with Parkinson disease should be considered throughout all phases of the disease, which includes an option of medical assistance in dying. evidence that they thought would warrant making an update to a recommendation. For those recommendations still considered valid, the experts were asked if they were aware of any new evidence that would change the grade or strength of evidence.\nThe Knowledge Synthesis Group used components of the ADAPTE process as the basis for the update. Research undertaken only in animals and opinion pieces were removed from the results.\nBefore the consensus meeting, the guideline panel identified several additional topics that were thought to be important and that had not been initially captured because of the stringent topic search conducted. These included depression and Parkinson disease (the initial search had been restricted to amitriptyline, as it was the only antidepressant included in the original guideline), pimavanserin and rotigotine. The Knowledge Synthesis Group extracted data from systematic reviews for these topics, and produced additional summaries to be distributed in advance of the consensus meeting.\nMany recommendations from the 2006 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline 7 had been adapted for inclusion in the 2012 Canadian guideline. An updated version of the NICE guideline was not identified in the literature search, as its publication date was initially scheduled for June 2017 (published in July 2017). 8 However, a draft version of the updated NICE guideline was available from October 2016 and was included in the materials supplied to the guideline panel for the consensus meeting.\nA full-day meeting with 29 guideline panel members was held on Apr The working groups reviewed the relevant summaries and the full text of the new literature on their topic. Each working group chair presented their group's recommendations to the entire guideline panel; this served as the basis for the initial voting matrix for each recommendation\nWorking group members used recommendations from the clinical practice guidelines identified during the literature search to update or create new recommendations. (At the meeting, some recommendations that required updating were identified that had not been raised by the original survey of experts.) If no appropriate recommendation was found in the available clinical practice guidelines, the guideline panel discussed the topic and referred it to the Knowledge Synthesis Group for a follow-up search of systematic reviews and, if necessary, RCTs.\nAfter the meeting, we created a voting matrix, organized into the 5 main themes with subsections.\n\n【1】 #Management of competing interests\nPanellists with competing interests were permitted to participate in panel discussions, and later in the voting matrix, without restriction.\n\n【2】 #Recommendations\nThis synopsis provides information on selected recommendations, along with the grade of and source for the recommendation.

Health care professionals committed to clear and empathic communication can make a meaningful difference to their patients. When people with Parkinson disease know what health care professionals recommend and why, they can participate in shared decision-making. Communication should be supported by the provision of evidence-based information, offered in a form that is tailored to the needs of the individual. Where possible, written materi al should be provided that includes instructions for medication use. Parkinson disease affects people living with the illness and their caregivers and family.

The diagnosis of Parkinson disease is still based predominantly on its clinical features; in 2015, the Movement Disorder Society 9 published new criteria for clinically established and probable Parkinson disease. Typical Parkinson disease must be differentiated from secondary parkinsonism or tremor resulting from neuroleptic drug exposure, essential tremor or structural changes in the brain, such as from normal pressure hydrocephalus, multiple small vessel disease strokes (i.e. vascular parkinsonism) and other neurodegenerative forms of parkinsonism, for example .\nPatients initially considered to have a possible diagnosis of Parkin son disease may benefit from a trial of dopamine replacement ther apy to assist with an accurate diagnosis (grade: good practice point; source: SIGN 13 ).\nA clear response to dopamine replacement therapy (e.g. levodopa/carbidopa 600 mg/d) in an individual with Parkinson disease could help to reinforce that an accurate diagnosis has been established.\n\n【37】 #Routine use of functional imaging is not recommended for the dif ferential diagnosis of Parkinson disease and Parkinson plus disor ders such as progressive supranuclear palsy and multiple system atrophy (grade: C; source: SIGN 13 ).\nPositron emission tomography scanning is not recommended as part of the diagnostic workup of parkinsonian syndromes, except within a research framework (grade: good practice point; source: SIGN 13 ).\n123 Iioflupane ( 123 IFPCIT) singlephoton emission computed tomography (SPECT) scanning should be considered as an aid to clinical diagnosis in patients where there is uncertainty between Parkinson disease and nondegenerative parkinsonism or tremor disorders (grade: B; source: SIGN 13 ).\nComputed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging brain scanning should not be routinely applied in the diagnosis of idio pathic Parkinson disease (grade: C; source: SIGN 13 ).\nImaging modalities have been extensively researched over the years for a more accurate diagnosis of Parkinson disease, in the differential diagnosis of parkinsonian disorders, as well as in the consideration of a possible progression marker for typical Parkinson disease. However, to date, no single test has been shown to have sufficient sensitivity and specificity to accomplish all 3 objectives.\n\n【38】 #Autonomic dysfunction C67\nBotulinum toxin A is efficacious for the symptomatic control of sialorrhea in PD. MDS 16 A C68 General measures for treating urinary urgency and incontinence include before bedtime, avoiding coffee and limiting water ingestion. When symptoms appear suddenly, exclude urinary tract infection.\n- Nocturia: reduce intake of fluid after 6 pm. Sleep with head-up tilt of bed to reduce urine production. - Nighttime dopaminergic therapy should be optimized.\n- For urinary urgency (overactive bladder), anticholinergic or antispasmodic drugs may be useful, but care must be taken regarding central adverse effects. - Botulinum toxin type A injected in the detrusor muscle.\nEFNS 15 GPP C69 For orthostatic hypotension, general measures would include the following:\n- Avoid aggravating factors such as large meals, alcohol, exposure to a warm environment and drugs known to cause orthostatic hypotension, such as diuretics or antihypertensive drugs.\nLevodopa and dopamine agonists may also worsen orthostatic hypotension. - Increase salt intake in symptomatic orthostatic hypotension.\n- Ensure head-up tilt of the bed at night. - Wear elastic stockings.\n- Highlight postprandial effects.

EFNS 14 Varied C72 For individuals with PD and erectile dysfunction:\n- Drugs associated with erectile dysfunction (e.g. α-blockers) or anorgasmia (e.g. selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) should be discontinued. Dopaminergic therapy can have both negative and positive effects on this symptom (grade: GPP). - Sildenafil 50-100 mg, 1 h before sex, can be tried in patients with PD with these problems (grade: B). - Other drugs of this class, such as tadalafil (10 mg, 30 min-12 h before sex) or vardenafil (10 mg, 1 h before sex) can be alternative choices (grade: GPP). - In some patients, apomorphine injections (5-10 min before sex) can also be an alternative treatment (grade: GPP). - Intracavernous injections of papaverine or alprostadil can be considered in selected patients (grade: GPP).\n\n【41】 #EFNS 15 Varied\nCognitive impairment\n\n【42】 #C73\nThe diagnoses of dementia associated with PD and of mild cognitive impairment in PD can be made using the Movement Disorder Society Clinical Diagnostic Criteria.

These include medications, surgical procedures, physiotherapy, occupational therapy and other support services.

Despite the increase in nonpharmacologic treatments, individuals with Parkinson disease become more reliant on their medication to maintain their ability to function as the\n\n【51】 #C93\nPeople with PD and their family members and caregivers (as appropriate) should be offered opportunities to discuss the prognosis of their condition. These discussions should promote people's priorities, shared decision-making and patient-centred care.\n\n【52】 #NICE 8 D C94\nPeople with PD and their family members and caregivers should be given appropriate verbal and written information about the following, and it should be recorded that the discussion has taken place:\n- Progression of PD - Possible future adverse effects of medicines for PD - Advance care planning, including orders for advanced decisions to refuse treatment and do not attempt resuscitation, and lasting power of attorney for finance and health and social care - Options for future management - What could happen at the end of life - Available support services; for example, personal care, equipment and practical support, financial support and advice, care at home and respite care.\n\n【53】 #NICE 8 D C95\nWhen discussing palliative care, it should be recognized that family members and caregivers may have different information needs from the person with PD.\n\n【54】 #NICE 8 D C96\nConsideration should be given to referring people at any stage of PD to the palliative care team to give them and their family members or caregivers (as appropriate) the opportunity to discuss palliative care and care at the end of life. disease progresses. A balance between the adverse effects of the medication and the benefit often becomes more difficult with time .\n\n【55】 #Levodopa\nLevodopa may be used as a symptomatic treatment for people with early Parkinson disease (grade: A; source: NICE 7 ).\nLevodopa remains the most effective medication for the treatment of motor symptoms and there is no reason to delay its use for those with bothersome motor symptoms.\n\n【56】 #Dopamine agonists\nDopamine agonists may be used as a symptomatic treatment for people with early Parkinson disease (grade: A; source: NICE 7 ).\nA dopamine agonist should be titrated to a clinically efficacious dose. If adverse effects prevent this, another agonist or a drug from another class should be used in its place (grade: D, good practice point; source: NICE 7 ).\nAlthough dopamine agonists are effective in the initial treatment of Parkinson disease, the risk of adverse effects is higher than with levodopa. In patients older than 70 years, dopamine agonists should be used with even more caution, if at all. There is no good evidence that one dopamine agonist is superior to another regarding control of motor symptoms in Parkinson disease, but only nonergot dopamine agonists should be used because of the risk of pulmonary and cardiac fibrosis seen with the older ergot agonists (e.g. bromocriptine). A transdermally administered dopamine agonist (rotigotine) is now available in Canada and has the conven ience of a single, daily, nonoral administration. Subcutaneous apomorphine infusions or injections may be con sidered for the management of severe motor complications, but should be provided only in units that have sufficient experience and resources (grade: C; source: SIGN 13 ).\nApomorphine is a nonergot dopamine agonist that can be administered in the form of subcutaneous injection. Health Canada has recently approved the latter formulation for the acute, intermittent treatment of \"off\" episodes. However, training is required for patients and caregivers.\nWhen starting dopamine agonist therapy, people and their family members and caregivers (as appropriate) should be given verbal and written information about the following, and the discussion should be recorded as having taken place:\n- The increased risk of developing impulse control disorders when taking dopamine agonist therapy, and that these may be concealed by the person affected. - The different types of impulse control disorders (e.g. compul sive gambling, hypersexuality, binge eating and obsessive shopping). - Who to contact if impulse control disorders develop.\n- The possibility that if problematic impulse control disorders develop, dopamine agonist therapy will be reviewed and may be reduced or stopped (grade: good practice point; source: NICE 8 ).\nIt should be recognized that impulse control disorders can develop in a person with Parkinson disease who is on any dopaminergic therapy at any stage in the disease course (grade: good practice point; source: NICE 8 ).\n\n【57】 #Device-aided therapies\nDeep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus or the globus pallidus interna is effective against motor fluctuations and dyskin esia (grade: A; source: EFNS 14 ).\nIntrajejunal levodopacarbidopa enteric gel administered through percutaneous gastrostomy may be considered for the reduction of offtime or to reduce dyskinesia (grade: C; source: EFNS 14 ).\nThe intrajejunal levodopa-carbidopa gel infusion through a percutaneous enteral tube is now available in Canada. It is accessible under limited use in tertiary movement disorders centres and can substantially reduce off-times when compared with standard oral levodopa. 14\n\n【58】 #Rehabilitation\nConsideration should be given to referring people who are in the early stages of Parkinson disease to a physiotherapist with experi ence of the disease for assessment, education and advice, includ ing information about physical activity (grade: B; source: NICE 8 ).\n\n【59】 #Nonmotor features\nAutonomic dysfunction is a common complication of Parkinson disease and can include cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, urogenital and thermoregulatory problems. These have a substantial negative impact on quality of life; however, the quality of evidence to guide management is poor.\nBotulinum toxin A is efficacious for the symptomatic control of sial orrhea in Parkinson disease (grade: A; source: MDS 16 ).\nSialorrhea can be cosmetically disturbing and can contribute to functional disability. Botulinum toxin A injections into the salivary glands have been shown to be efficacious to treat sialorrhea. 16 For orthostatic hypotension, drug therapy includes the addition of:\n- midodrine ,grade: A; source: EFNS 14  The management of depression in people with Parkinson disease should be tailored to the individual -in particular, to their co existing therapy (grade: D, good practice point; source: NICE 7 ).\nDepression frequently manifests even before the onset of motor symptoms of Parkinson disease and becomes more prominent and increasingly challenging to treat with disease progression. Unfortunately, there continues to be a paucity of high-quality research trials to support the choice of symptomatic therapies. The principles guiding the use of antidepressants in Parkinson disease are similar to those guiding their use in other medically ill populations in general: start low and go slow, with the effective dose often being less than that recommended for the general population.\n\n【60】 #Palliative care\nThere is growing information with respect to palliative care in Parkinson disease and the guideline panel therefore thought that the topic was an important addition to the new guideline. End-of-life choices, including advance care planning with an open and frank discussion with the patient and the person designated as decision-maker, should be initiated early in the disease process. Conversations occurring in the ambulatory setting are likely to be more productive and less crisis driven than leaving such conversations until an acute stay in hospital.\n\n【61】 #Implementation\nParkinson Canada will assist in disseminating print and electronic versions of the guideline to health care providers, individuals with Parkinson disease and their families, as well as post the full guideline on its website. As part of the Parkinson Canada affiliation with the Neurological Health Charities Canada, the guideline will be used to assist in advocacy efforts to federal and provincial governments to improve the care of individuals with Parkinson disease, as well as other brain diseases.\nA clear barrier to the implementation of this guideline is a lack of adequate access to health care providers with expertise in dealing with individuals with Parkinson disease. This includes not only specialty physicians but also nurses, speech, occupational and physical therapists with adequate training to deal with these patients who have this very complex condition. Access to palliative care treatment is also lacking for Canadians with neurodegenerative disease and should be addressed at local and national levels of care delivery.\nDeep brain stimulation therapy and intrajejunal levodopacarbidopa enteric gel therapy are expensive and complex to use, and most centres have limited budgetary or human resources with respect to the number of procedures they can perform and continue to manage.\nThe cost of care for neurodegenerative diseases in general will increase as our population ages. The limits that our publicly funded health care system can provide must be addressed, but are outside the scope of this guideline. Parkinson Canada, as well as patients and their families, will continue to play an important role in advocating for more resources and the dissemination of knowledge to improve the care and support of all of those affected by this disease.\n\n【62】 #Other guidelines\nThis guideline draws on the recommendations of the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network, 13 the European Federation of Neurological Societies, 14,15 the Movement Disorder Society, 16 the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence 7,8 and the American Academy practice parameters. 17 We used knowledge taken from these other guidelines to form the basis of this guideline update, and we chose the recommendations for their relevance to our Canadian health care system.\n\n【63】 #Gaps in knowledge\nThere remain important knowledge gaps with respect to many areas of Parkinson disease. Understanding the pathophysiology of the disease will allow for the development of more effective and potentially disease-modifying treatments. Even if we do not yet fully understand disease-causing mechanisms, having good biomarkers for Parkinson disease will accelerate the development of new therapies\n\n【64】 #Conclusion\nImportant strides have been made in improving our understanding of Parkinson disease, as well as its treatment. Management of the disease remains complex, and all members of the health care team need access to the most up-to-date information available. Effectively communicating information among all members of the health care team and the patient is essential for optimal care delivery, yet obstacles remain. The cost of care for Parkinson disease and neurodegenerative diseases in general will increase as our population ages. Decisions about the limits that our publicly funded health care system can provide need to be addressed.\nContributors: All of the authors contributed to the conception and design of the work, and the acquisition, analysis, and interpretation of data.

Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) should be evaluated by echocardiogram or MUGA prior to administration of the initial dose of Mitoxantrone Injection, USP and all subsequent doses.  In addition, LVEF evaluations are recommended if signs or symptoms of congestive heart failure develop at any time during treatment with Mitoxantrone Injection, USP.  Mitoxantrone Injection, USP should not be administered to multiple sclerosis patients with an LVEF <50%, with a clinically significant reduction in LVEF, or to those who have received a cumulative lifetime dose of ≥ 140 mg/m2.  Complete blood counts, including platelets, should be monitored prior to each course of Mitoxantrone Injection, USP and in the event that signs or symptoms of infection develop.  Mitoxantrone Injection, USP generally should not be administered to multiple sclerosis patients with neutrophil counts less than 1500 cells/mm3.  Liver function tests should also be monitored prior to each course.  Mitoxantrone Injection, USP therapy in multiple sclerosis patients with abnormal liver function tests is not recommended because Mitoxantrone Injection, USP clearance is reduced by hepatic impairment and no laboratory measurement can predict drug clearance and dose adjustments.\n- Women with multiple sclerosis who are biologically capable of becoming pregnant, even if they are using birth control, should have a pregnancy test, and the results should be known, before receiving each dose of Mitoxantrone Injection, USP.\n- Based on data from two Phase 3 comparative trials of mitoxantrone injection plus corticosteroids versus corticosteroids alone, the recommended dosage of mitoxantrone is 12 to 14 mg/m2 given as a short intravenous infusion every 21 days.\n- For induction, the recommended dosage is 12 mg/m2 of Mitoxantrone Injection daily on Days 1 to 3 given as an intravenous infusion, and 100 mg/m2 of cytarabine for 7 days given as a continuous 24-hour infusion on Days 1 to 7.\n- Most complete remissions will occur following the initial course of induction therapy.  In the event of an incomplete antileukemic response, a second induction course may be given. Mitoxantrone Injection should be given for 2 days and cytarabine for 5 days using the same daily dosage levels.\n- If severe or life-threatening nonhematologic toxicity is observed during the first induction course, the second induction course should be withheld until toxicity resolves.\n- Consolidation therapy which was used in two large randomized multicenter trials consisted of mitoxantrone, 12 mg/m2 given by intravenous infusion daily on Days 1 and 2 and cytarabine, 100 mg/m2 for 5 days given as a continuous 24-hour infusion on Days 1 to 5.  The first course was given approximately 6 weeks after the final induction course; the second was generally administered 4 weeks after the first.  Severe myelosuppression occurred.\n\n【3】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Mitoxantrone in adult patients.\n\n【4】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n- MitoXANTRONE 80 mg/m on day 3.\n- LOW-DOSE mitoXANTRONE 8 milligrams (mg)/square meter intravenously every four weeks.\n- MitoXANTRONE 12 milligrams/square meter (mg/m) up to a maximum of 14 mg/m.\n- MitoXANTRONE initial doses of 14 milligrams/square meter intravenously every three weeks, increasing by 2 milligrams/square meter every second course in the absence of significant myelotoxicity.\n\n【5】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Pediatric)\nThere is limited information regarding FDA-Labeled Use of Mitoxantrone in pediatric patients.\n\n【6】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Mitoxantrone in pediatric patients.\n\n【7】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n- MitoXANTRONE given in a dose of 18 milligrams/square meter as an intravenous infusion every 3 weeks.\n\n【8】 #Contraindications\n- Mitoxantrone Injection, USP is contraindicated in patients who have demonstrated prior hypersensitivity to it.\n\n【9】 - Patients with pre-existing myelosuppression as the result of prior drug therapy should not receive mitoxantrone unless it is felt that the possible benefit from such treatment warrants the risk of further medullary suppression.\n- The safety of Mitoxantrone Injection, USP (concentrate) in patients with hepatic insufficiency is not established.\n- Safety for use by routes other than intravenous administration has not been established.\n- Mitoxantrone is not indicated for subcutaneous, intramuscular, or intra-arterial injection.  There have been reports of local/regional neuropathy, some irreversible, following intra-arterial injection.\n- Topoisomerase II inhibitors, including mitoxantrone, have been associated with the development of secondary acute myeloid leukemia and myelosuppression.\n- Cardiac Effects\n- Functional cardiac changes including decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and irreversible congestive heart failure can occur with mitoxantrone.  Cardiac toxicity may be more common in patients with prior treatment with anthracyclines, prior mediastinal radiotherapy, or with pre-existing cardiovascular disease.  Such patients should have regular cardiac monitoring of LVEF from the initiation of therapy. Cancer patients who received cumulative doses of 140 mg/m2 either alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents had a cumulative 2.6% probability of clinical congestive heart failure. In comparative oncology trials, the overall cumulative probability rate of moderate or severe decreases in LVEF at this dose was 13%.\n- Multiple Sclerosis - Leukemia - Acute congestive heart failure may occasionally occur in patients treated with mitoxantrone for ANLL.  In first-line comparative trials of mitoxantrone + cytarabine vs. daunorubicin + cytarabine in adult patients with previously untreated ANLL, therapy was associated with congestive heart failure in 6.5% of patients on each arm.  A causal relationship between drug therapy and cardiac effects is difficult to establish in this setting since myocardial function is frequently depressed by the anemia, fever and infection, and hemorrhage that often accompany the underlying disease.\n- Hormone-Refractory Prostate Cancer\n- Among 112 patients evaluable for safety on the mitoxantrone + hydrocortisone arm of the CALGB trial, 18 patients (19%) had a reduction in cardiac function, 5 patients (5%) had cardiac ischemia, and 2 patients (2%) experienced pulmonary edema. The range of total mitoxantrone doses administered to these patients is not available.\n- Pregnancy\n- Mitoxantrone may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.  Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant. Mitoxantrone is considered a potential human teratogen because of its mechanism of action and the developmental effects demonstrated by related agents.  Treatment of pregnant rats during the organogenesis period of gestation was associated with fetal growth retardation at doses ≥ 0.1 mg/kg/day (0.01 times the recommended human dose on a mg/m2 basis). When pregnant rabbits were treated during organogenesis, an increased incidence of premature delivery was observed at doses ≥ 0.1 mg/kg/day (0.01 times the recommended human dose on a mg/m2 basis). No teratogenic effects were observed in these studies, but the maximum doses tested were well below the recommended human dose (0.02 and 0.05 times in rats and rabbits, respectively, on a mg/m2 basis).  There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.  Women with multiple sclerosis who are biologically capable of becoming pregnant should have a pregnancy test prior to each dose, and the results should be known prior to administration of the drug.  If this drug is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential risk to the fetus.\n- Secondary Leukemia - In a study of patients with prostate cancer, acute myeloid leukemia occurred in 1% (5/487) of mitoxantrone-treated patients versus no cases in the control group (0/496) not receiving mitoxantrone at 4.7 years follow-up.\n- In a prospective, open-label, tolerability and safety monitoring study of mitoxantrone treated MS patients followed for up to five years (median of 2.8 years), leukemia occurred in 0.6% (3/509) of patients.  Publications describe leukemia risks of 0.25% to 2.8% in cohorts of patients with MS treated with mitoxantrone and followed for varying periods of time.  This leukemia risk exceeds the risk of leukemia in the general population.  The most commonly reported types were acute promyelocytic leukemia and acute myelocytic leukemia.\n- Secondary acute myeloid leukemia has also been reported in cancer patients treated with anthracyclines.  Mitoxantrone is an anthracenedione, a related drug.  The occurrence of secondary leukemia is more common when anthracyclines are given in combination with DNA-damaging antineoplastic agents, when patients have been heavily pretreated with cytotoxic drugs, or when doses of anthracyclines have been escalated.\n- Symptoms of acute leukemia may include excessive bruising, bleeding, and recurrent infections.\n\n【10】 ### Precautions\n- Therapy with mitoxantrone should be accompanied by close and frequent monitoring of hematologic and chemical laboratory parameters, as well as frequent patient observation.\n- Systemic infections should be treated concomitantly with or just prior to commencing therapy with mitoxantrone.\n\n【11】 ## Clinical Trials Experience\n- Mitoxantrone has been administered to 149 patients with multiple sclerosis in two randomized clinical trials, including 21 patients who received mitoxantrone in combination with corticosteroids.\n- In Study 1, the proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to an adverse event was 9.7% (n = 6) in the 12 mg/m2 mitoxantrone arm (leukopenia, depression, decreased LV function, bone pain and emesis, renal failure, and one discontinuation to prevent future complications from repeated urinary tract infections) compared to 3.1% (n = 2) in the placebo arm (hepatitis and myocardial infarction).  The following clinical adverse experiences were significantly more frequent in the mitoxantrone groups: nausea, alopecia, urinary tract infection, and menstrual disorders, including amenorrhea.\nThe majority of these events were of mild to moderate intensity, and nausea was the only adverse event that occurred with severe intensity in more than one patient (three patients  in the 12 mg/m2 group).  Of note, alopecia consisted of mild hair thinning.\n\n【12】 - There was no difference among treatment groups in the incidence or severity of hemorrhagic events.\n- Mitoxantrone has been studied in approximately 600 patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL)S. comparative study of mitoxantrone + cytarabine vs. daunorubicin + cytarabine.  Experience in the large international study was similar.  A much wider experience in a variety of other tumor types revealed no additional important reactions other than cardiomyopathy.  It should be appreciated that the listed adverse reaction categories include overlapping clinical symptoms related to the same condition, e.g. dyspnea, cough and pneumonia.  In addition, the listed adverse reactions cannot all necessarily be attributed to chemotherapy as it is often impossible to distinguish effects of the drug and effects of the underlying disease.  It is clear, however, that the combination of mitoxantrone + cytarabine was responsible for nausea and vomiting, alopecia, mucositis/stomatitis, and myelosuppression.\n- Adverse reactions are presented as major categories and selected examples of clinically significant subcategories.\n- Detailed safety information is available for a total of 353 patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer treated with mitoxantrone, including 274 patients who received mitoxantrone in combination with corticosteroids.\n\n【13】 Hypotension, urticaria, dyspnea, and rashes have been reported occasionally.  Anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid reactions have been reported rarely.\nExtravasation at the infusion site has been reported, which may result in erythema, swelling, pain, burning, and/or blue discoloration of the skin.  Extravasation can result in tissue necrosis with resultant need for debridement and skin grafting.  Phlebitis has also been reported at the site of the infusion.\nTopoisomerase II inhibitors, including mitoxantrone, in combination with other antineoplastic agents or alone, have been associated with the development of acute leukemia.\nMyelosuppression is rapid in onset and is consistent with the requirement to produce significant marrow hypoplasia in order to achieve a response in acute leukemia.  The incidences of infection and bleeding seen in the U.S. trial are consistent with those reported for other standard induction regimens.\nIn a randomized study where dose escalation was required for neutrophil counts greater than 1000/mm3, Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC < 500 /mm3) was observed in 54% of patients treated with mitoxantrone + low-dose prednisone.  In a separate randomized trial where patients were treated with 14 mg/m2, Grade 4 neutropenia in 23% of patients treated with mitoxantrone + hydrocortisone was observed.  Neutropenic fever/infection occurred in 11% and 10% of patients receiving mitoxantrone + corticosteroids, respectively, on the two trials.  Platelets < 50,000/mm3 were noted in 4% and 3% of patients receiving mitoxantrone + corticosteroids on these trials, and there was one patient death on mitoxantrone + hydrocortisone due to intracranial hemorrhage after a fall.\nNausea and vomiting occurred acutely in most patients and may have contributed to reports of dehydration, but were generally mild to moderate and could be controlled through the use of antiemetics.  Stomatitis/mucositis occurred within 1 week of therapy.\nCongestive heart failure, tachycardia, EKG changes including arrhythmias, chest pain, and asymptomatic decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction have occurred .\nInterstitial pneumonitis has been reported in cancer patients receiving combination chemotherapy that included mitoxantrone.\n\n【14】 ## Postmarketing Experience\nThere is limited information regarding Postmarketing Experience of Mitoxantrone in the drug label.\n\n【15】 #Drug Interactions\n- Mitoxantrone and its metabolites are excreted in bile and urine, but it is not known whether the metabolic or excretory pathways are saturable, may be inhibited or induced, or if mitoxantrone and its metabolites undergo enterohepatic circulation.  To date, post-marketing experience has not revealed any significant drug interactions in patients who have received mitoxantrone for treatment of cancer.  Information on drug interactions in patients with multiple sclerosis is limited.\n- Following concurrent administration of mitoxantrone with corticosteroids, no evidence of drug interactions has been observed.\n\n【16】 ### Pregnancy\nPregnancy Category (FDA):\n- Pregnancy Category D\n- Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) Pregnancy Category\nThere is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Mitoxantrone in women who are pregnant.\n\n【17】 ### Labor and Delivery\nThere is no FDA guidance on use of Mitoxantrone during labor and delivery.\n\n【18】 ### Nursing Mothers\n- Mitoxantrone is excreted in human milk and significant concentrations (18 ng/mL) have been reported for 28 days after the last administration.  Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in infants from mitoxantrone, breastfeeding should be discontinued before starting treatment.\n\n【19】 ### Pediatric Use\n- Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.\n\n【20】 ### Geriatic Use\n- Multiple Sclerosis - Clinical studies of mitoxantrone did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients.  Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.\n- Hormone-Refractory Prostate Cancer\n- Acute Nonlymphocytic Leukemia\n\n【21】 ### Gender\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Mitoxantrone with respect to specific gender populations.\n\n【22】 ### Race\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Mitoxantrone with respect to specific racial populations.\n\n【23】 ### Renal Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Mitoxantrone in patients with renal impairment.\n\n【24】 ### Hepatic Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Mitoxantrone in patients with hepatic impairment.\n\n【25】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Mitoxantrone in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n\n【26】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\nThere is no FDA guidance one the use of Mitoxantrone in patients who are immunocompromised.\n\n【27】 ### Administration\n- Intravenous\n\n【28】 ### Monitoring\nThere is limited information regarding Monitoring of Mitoxantrone in the drug label.\n\n【29】 #IV Compatibility\n- Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit.\n- The dose of mitoxantrone should be diluted to at least 50 mL with either 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection (USP) or 5% Dextrose Injection (USP).  Mitoxantrone Injection, USP (concentrate) may be further diluted into Dextrose 5% in Water, Normal Saline or Dextrose 5% with Normal Saline and used immediately.  DO NOT FREEZE.\n- Mitoxantrone should not be mixed in the same infusion as heparin since a precipitate may form.  Because specific compatibility data are not available, it is recommended that mitoxantrone not be mixed in the same infusion with other drugs.  The diluted solution should be introduced slowly into the tubing as a freely running intravenous infusion of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection (USP) or 5% Dextrose Injection (USP) over a period of not less than 3 minutes.  Unused infusion solutions should be discarded immediately in an appropriate fashion.  In the case of multidose use, after penetration of the stopper, the remaining portion of the undiluted Mitoxantrone Injection, USP (concentrate) should be stored not longer than 7 days between 15° to 25°C (59° to 77°F) or 14 days under refrigeration.  DO NOT FREEZE.  CONTAINS NO PRESERVATIVE.\n- Care in the administration of mitoxantrone will reduce the chance of extravasation.  Mitoxantrone should be administered into the tubing of a freely running intravenous infusion of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP or 5% Dextrose Injection, USP.  The tubing should be attached to a Butterfly needle or other suitable device and inserted preferably into a large vein.\n- Skin accidentally exposed to mitoxantrone should be rinsed copiously with warm water and if the eyes are involved, standard irrigation techniques should be used immediately.  The use of goggles, gloves, and protective gowns is recommended during preparation and administration of the drug.\n\n【30】 ## Acute Overdose\n- There is no known specific antidote for mitoxantrone.  Accidental overdoses have been reported.  Four patients receiving 140 to 180 mg/m2 as a single bolus injection died as a result of severe leukopenia with infection.  Hematologic support and antimicrobial therapy may be required during prolonged periods of severe myelosuppression.\n- Although patients with severe renal failure have not been studied, mitoxantrone is extensively tissue bound and it is unlikely that the therapeutic effect or toxicity would be mitigated by peritoneal or hemodialysis.\n\n【31】 ## Chronic Overdose\nThere is limited information regarding Chronic Overdose of Mitoxantrone in the drug label.\n\n【32】 ## Mechanism of Action\n- Mitoxantrone, a DNA-reactive agent that intercalates into deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) through hydrogen bonding, causes crosslinks and strand breaks.  Mitoxantrone also interferes with ribonucleic acid (RNA) and is a potent inhibitor of topoisomerase II, an enzyme responsible for uncoiling and repairing damaged DNA.  It has a cytocidal effect on both proliferating and nonproliferating cultured human cells, suggesting lack of cell cycle phase specificity.\n- Mitoxantrone has been shown in vitro to inhibit B cell, T cell, and macrophage proliferation and impair antigen presentation, as well as the secretion of interferon gamma, TNFα, and IL-2.\n\n【33】 ## Structure\n- Mitoxantrone Injection, USP (concentrate) is a synthetic antineoplastic anthracenedione for intravenous use.  It is supplied as a concentrate that MUST BE DILUTED PRIOR TO INJECTION.  The concentrate is a sterile, nonpyrogenic, dark blue aqueous solution containing mitoxantrone hydrochloride equivalent to 2 mg/mL mitoxantrone free base, with the following inactive ingredients: sodium chloride (0.800% w/v), sodium acetate (0.005% w/v), acetic acid (0.046% w/v), and water for injection.  The solution has a pH of 3.0 to 4.5 and contains 0.14 mEq of sodium per mL.  The product does not contain preservatives.  The chemical name is 1,4-dihydroxy-5,8-bisethylamino-9,10- anthracenedione dihydrochloride and the structural formula is:\n\n【34】 ## Pharmacodynamics\nThere is limited information regarding Pharmacodynamics of Mitoxantrone in the drug label.\n\n【35】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n- Pharmacokinetics of mitoxantrone in patients following a single intravenous administration of mitoxantrone can be characterized by a three-compartment model.  The mean alpha half-life of mitoxantrone is 6 to 12 minutes, the mean beta half-life is 1.1 to 3.1 hours and the mean gamma (terminal or elimination) half-life is 23 to 215 hours (median approximately 75 hours).\n- Pharmacokinetic studies have not been performed in humans receiving multiple daily dosing.  Distribution to tissues is extensive: steady-state volume of distribution exceeds 1,000 L/m2.\n- Tissue concentrations of mitoxantrone appear to exceed those in the blood during the terminal elimination phase.  In the healthy monkey, distribution to brain, spinal cord, eye, and spinal fluid is low.\n- In patients administered 15 to 90 mg/m2 of mitoxantrone intravenously, there is a linear relationship between dose and the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC).\n- Mitoxantrone is 78% bound to plasma proteins in the observed concentration range of 26 to 455 ng/mL.  This binding is independent of concentration and is not affected by the presence of phenytoin, doxorubicin, methotrexate, prednisone, prednisolone, heparin, or aspirin.\n- Metabolism and Elimination\n- Mitoxantrone is excreted in urine and feces as either unchanged drug or as inactive metabolites.  In human studies, 11% and 25% of the dose were recovered in urine and feces, respectively, as either parent drug or metabolite during the 5-day period following drug administration.  Of the material recovered in urine, 65% was unchanged drug.  The remaining 35% was composed of monocarboxylic and dicarboxylic acid derivatives and their glucuronide conjugates.  The pathways leading to the metabolism of mitoxantrone have not been elucidated.\n- Special Populations\n- Gender\n- The effect of gender on mitoxantrone pharmacokinetics is unknown.\n- Geriatric\n- Race\n- Renal Impairment\n- Mitoxantrone pharmacokinetics in patients with renal impairment are unknown.\n- Drug Interactions\n- In vitro drug interaction studies have demonstrated that mitoxantrone did not inhibit CYP450 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4 across a broad concentration range.  The results of in vitro induction studies are inconclusive, but suggest that mitoxantrone may be a weak inducer of CYP450 2E1 activity.\n\n【36】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\n- Carcinogenesis - Intravenous treatment of rats and mice, once every 21 days for 24 months, with mitoxantrone resulted in an increased incidence of fibroma and external auditory canal tumors in rats at a dose of 0.03 mg/kg (0.02 fold the recommended human dose, on a mg/m2 basis), and hepatocellular adenoma in male mice at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg (0.03 fold the recommended human dose, on a mg/m2 basis).  Intravenous treatment of rats, once every 21 days for 12 months with mitoxantrone resulted in an increased incidence of external auditory canal tumors in rats at a dose of 0.3 mg/kg (0.15 fold the recommended human dose, on a mg/m2 basis).\n- Mutagenesis - Mitoxantrone was clastogenic in the in vivo rat bone marrow assay.  Mitoxantrone was also clastogenic in two in vitro assays; it induced DNA damage in primary rat hepatocytes and sister chromatid exchanges in Chinese hamster ovary cells.  Mitoxantrone was mutagenic in bacterial and mammalian test systems (Ames/Salmonella and E. coli and L5178Y TK+/-mouse lymphoma).\n\n【37】 #Clinical Studies\n- The safety and efficacy of mitoxantrone in multiple sclerosis were assessed in two randomized, multicenter clinical studies.\n- One randomized, controlled study (Study 1) was conducted in patients with secondary progressive or progressive relapsing multiple sclerosis.  Patients in this study demonstrated significant neurological disability based on the Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). The EDSS is an ordinal scale with 0.5 point increments ranging from 0.0 to 10.0 (increasing score indicates worsening) and based largely on ambulatory impairment in its middle range (EDSS 4.5 to 7.5 points).  Patients in this study had experienced a mean deterioration in EDSS of about 1.6 points over the 18 months prior to enrollment.\n- Patients were randomized to receive placebo, 5 mg/m2 mitoxantrone, or 12 mg/m2 mitoxantrone administered IV every 3 months for 2 years.  High-dose methylprednisolone was administered to treat relapses.  The intent-to-treat analysis cohort consisted of 188 patients; 149 completed the 2-year study.  Patients were evaluated every 3 months, and clinical outcome was determined after 24 months.  In addition, a subset of patients was assessed with magnetic resonance imaging  at baseline, Month 12, and Month 24.  Neurologic assessments and MRI reviews were performed by evaluators blinded to study drug and clinical outcome, although the diagnosis of relapse and the decision to treat relapses with steroids were made by unblinded treating physicians.  A multivariate analysis of five clinical variables (EDSS, Ambulation Index , number of relapses requiring treatment with steroids, months to first relapse needing treatment with steroids, and Standard Neurological Status ) was used to determine primary efficacy.  The AI is an ordinal scale ranging from 0 to 9 in one point increments to define progressive ambulatory impairment.  The SNS provides an overall measure of neurologic impairment and disability, with scores ranging from 0 (normal neurologic examination) to 99 (worst possible score).\n\n【38】 - A multicenter Phase 2 trial of mitoxantrone and low-dose prednisone (M + P) was conducted in 27 symptomatic patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer.  Using NPCP (National Prostate Cancer Project) criteria for disease response, there was one partial responder and 12 patients with stable disease.  However, nine patients or 33% achieved a palliative response defined on the basis of reduction in analgesic use or pain intensity.\n- These findings led to the initiation of a randomized multicenter trial (CCI-NOV22) comparing the effectiveness of (M + P) to low-dose prednisone alone (P).  Eligible patients were required to have metastatic or locally advanced disease that had progressed on standard hormonal therapy, a castrate serum testosterone level, and at least mild pain at study entry.  Mitoxantrone was administered at a dose of 12 mg/m2 by short IV infusion every 3 weeks.  Prednisone was administered orally at a dose of 5 mg twice a day.  Patients randomized to the prednisone arm were crossed over to the M + P arm if they progressed or if they were not improved after a minimum of 6 weeks of therapy with prednisone alone.\n- A total of 161 patients were randomized, 80 to the M + P arm and 81 to the P arm.  The median mitoxantrone dose administered was 12 mg/m2 per cycle.  The median cumulative mitoxantrone dose administered was 73 mg/m2 (range of 12 to 212 mg/m2).\n- The median duration of primary palliative response for patients randomized to M + P was 7.6 months compared to 2.1 months for patients randomized to P alone  (p = 0.0009).  The median duration of overall palliative response for patients randomized to M + P was 5.6 months compared to 1.9 months for patients randomized to P alone (p = 0.0004).\n- Forty-eight patients on the P arm crossed over to receive M + P.  Of these, thirty patients had progressed on P, while 18 had stable disease on P.  The median cycle of crossover was 5 cycles (range of 2 to 16 cycles).  Time trends for pain intensity prior to crossover were significantly worse for patients who crossed over than for those who remained on P alone (p = 0.012).  Nine patients (19%) demonstrated a palliative response on M + P after crossover.  The median time to death for patients who crossed over to M + P was 12.7 months.\n- In these studies, two consolidation courses were administered to complete responders on each arm.  Consolidation therapy consisted of the same drug and daily dosage used for remission induction, but only 5 days of cytarabine and 2 days of mitoxantrone or daunorubicin were given.  The first consolidation course was administered 6 weeks after the start of the final induction course if the patient achieved a complete remission.  The second consolidation course was generally administered 4 weeks later.  Full hematologic recovery was necessary for patients to receive consolidation therapy.  For the U.S. trial, median granulocyte nadirs for patients receiving mitoxantrone + cytarabine for consolidation courses 1 and 2 were 10/mm3 for both courses, and for those patients receiving daunorubicin + cytarabine nadirs were 170/mm3 and 260/mm3, respectively.  Median platelet nadirs for patients who received mitoxantrone + cytarabine for consolidation courses 1 and 2 were 17,000/mm3 and 14,000/mm3, respectively, and were 33,000/mm3 and 22,000/mm3 in courses 1 and 2 for those patients who received daunorubicin + cytarabine.  The benefit of consolidation therapy in ANLL patients who achieve a complete remission remains controversial.  However, in the only well-controlled prospective, randomized multicenter trials with mitoxantrone in ANLL, consolidation therapy was given to all patients who achieved a complete remission.  During consolidation in the U.S. study, two myelosuppression-related deaths occurred on the mitoxantrone arm and one on the daunorubicin arm. However, in the international study there were eight deaths on the mitoxantrone arm during consolidation which were related to the myelosuppression and none on the daunorubicin arm where less myelosuppression occurred.\n\n【39】 #How Supplied\n- Mitoxantrone Injection, USP (concentrate) is a sterile aqueous solution containing mitoxantrone hydrochloride at a concentration equivalent to 2 mg mitoxantrone free base per mL supplied in vials for multidose use as follows:\n- The above products are packaged individually.\n- Store between 20º to 25ºC (68° to 77°F) .

This document provides preventive measures that building owners and managers can implement promptly to protect building air environments from a terrorist release of chemical, biological, or radiological contaminants. These recommendations, focusing on shortterm actions, are only the beginning of a process to develop more comprehensive guidance. Working with the Building Air Protection Workgroup, as well as partners in the public and private sectors, NIOSH will continue to build on this effort. This document is a useful first step in the process\n\n【1】 #Foreword\nThe Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970  assures so far as possible every working man and woman in the Nation safe and healthful working conditions. The Act charges the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) with conducting research and making science-based recommendations to prevent work-related illness, injury, disability, and death.\nOn October 8, 2001, the President of the United States established by executive order the Office of Homeland Security (OHS), which is mandated \"to develop and coordinate the implementation of a comprehensive national strategy to secure the United States from terrorist threats or attacks.\" In January 2002, the OHS formed the Interagency Workgroup on Building Air Protection under the Medical and Public Health Preparedness Policy Coordinating Committee of the OHS. The Workgroup includes representatives from agencies throughout the Federal government, including NIOSH, which is part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nWith U.S. workers facing potential hazards associated with chemical, biological, or radiological terrorism, the missions of the OHS and NIOSH overlap. As with most hazards, there are preventive steps that can reduce the likelihood and mitigate the impact of terrorist threats.\nIn addition to the efforts of the Workgroup, the contributions of the NIOSH Research Team on Building Vulnerabilities are greatly appreciated. This team was augmented by representatives from Sandia National Laboratories and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR). Many of the recommendations found in this document originated from the numerous vulnerability assessments conducted by this team\nAnne Votaw, Pauline Elliott, Anne Stirnkorb, and Dick Carlson (NIOSH) provided editorial support, produced the camera-ready copy, and prepared the graphics. Review and preparation for printing were performed by Penny Arthur.\n\n【2】 #SCOPE\nT HIS DOCUMENT IDENTIFIES ACTIONS that a building owner or manager can implement without undue delay to enhance occupant protection from an airborne chemical, biological, or radiological (CBR) attack. The intended audience includes building owners, managers, and maintenance personnel of public, private, and governmental buildings, including offices, laboratories, hospitals, retail facilities, schools, transportation terminals, and public venues (for example, sports arenas, malls, coliseums). This document is not intended to address single-family or low-occupancy residential housing (less than five family units). Higher risk facilities such as industrial facilities, military facilities, subway systems, and law enforcement facilities require special considerations that are beyond the scope of this guide.\n\n【3】 #P rotecting B uilding E nvironments from Airborne Chemical, Biological, or Radiological Attacks\nThe likelihood of a specific building being targeted for terrorist activity is generally difficult to predict. As such, there is no specific formula that will determine a certain building's level of risk. Building owners must make their own decisions about how to reduce their building's risk to a CBR attack. These decisions may be aided by a comprehensive building security assessment. Many government and private organizations have identified resources that provide insight into building security assessments\nNo building can be fully protected from a determined individual who is intent on releasing a CBR agent. The recommendations in this guide will not preclude injuries or fatalities in the event of a CBR release. However, facility owners and managers can transform their buildings into less attractive targets by increasing the difficulty of introducing a CBR agent, by increasing the ability to detect terrorists before they carry out an intended release, and by incorporating plans and procedures to mitigate the effects of a CBR release These recommendations focus on airborne releases of CBR agents- in quantities capable of being easily transported by a few individuals. Protection from other types of attacks such as explosions, building collapses, and water supply contamination require much different measures and are not addressed in this document.\n\n【4】 #BACKGROUND\nTerrorism events have increased interest in the vulnerability of U.S. workplaces, schools, and other occupied buildings to CBR threats. Of particular concern are the airflow patterns and dynamics in buildings, specifically in the building heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems. These systems can become an entry point and a distribution system for hazardous contaminants, particularly CBR agents. Building owners need reliable information about how they can  modify their buildings to decrease the likelihood or effects of a CBR incident and  respond quickly and appropriately should a CBR incident occur. Comprehensive guidance is needed in several areas, including: p How to modify existing buildings for better air protection and security.\np How to design new buildings to be more secure.\np What plans building managers should prepare in advance to help them make effective decisions in the midst of a CBR incident.\n\n【5】 #PREPARATORY RECOMMENDATION-KNOW YOUR BUILDING\nWhile more comprehensive guidance is being developed, this document focuses on the shorter-term goals of identifying those protective actions that you can take immediately. But it recognizes that some recommendations may not be feasible for you or in all situations.\nIn initiating any plan to modify building system design or operation, an important first step is to understand these systems: How were they intended to operate? How do they currently operate?\nGetting to know your building may best be handled by conducting a walk-through inspection of the building and its systems, including the HVAC, fire protection, and life-safety systems. During this inspection, compare the most up-to-date design drawings available to the operation of the current systems.- This step may require, or benefit from, the assistance of qualified outside professionals. Without this baseline knowledge, it is difficult to accurately identify what impact a particular security modification may have on building operation. While it is important to understand how the existing building systems function, the systems need not operate per design before you implement security measures. A partial list of items to consider during your building walk-through includes:\np What is the mechanical condition of the equipment?\n\n【6】 #SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS\nThe recommendations can be divided into four general categories:  things not to do;  physical security;  ventilation and filtration; and  maintenance, administration, and training Items within each of the four categories are listed in the order of priority. Items considered to be highly critical are identified by \"*\" next to the number. As you review these recommendations, consider their potential implications upon the contract language necessary for existing and future service contracts. A brief discussion of the four categories and some commonly considered recommendations follow.\n\n【7】 #Things not to do\nMore than anything else, building owners and managers should ensure that any actions they take do not have a detrimental effect on the building systems (HVAC, fire protection, life safety, etc.) or the building occupants under normal building operation. Some efforts to protect the building from a CBR attack could have adverse effects on the building's indoor environmental quality. Building owners and managers should understand how the building systems operate and assess the impact of security measures on those systems. This caution directly relates to the recommendation that building owners and managers should understand the operation of their building systems. If there is uncertainty about the effects of a proposed modification, a qualified professional should be consulted.\n\n【8】 #*3. DO NOT INTERFERE WITH FIRE PROTECTION AND LIFE SAFETY\nSYSTEMS. These systems provide protection in the event of fire or other types of events. They should not be altered without guidance from a professional specifically qualified in fire protection and life safety systems.\n\n【9】 #Physical Security\nPreventing terrorist access to a targeted facility requires physical security of entry, storage, roof, and mechanical areas, as well as securing access to the outdoor air intakes of the building HVAC system. The physical security needs of each building should be assessed, as the threat of a CBR attack will vary considerably from building to building. For example, the threat to a large corporate headquarters may be considered greater than the threat to a small retail establishment. Some physical security measures, such as locking doors to mechanical rooms, are low cost and will not inconvenience the users of the building. These types of measures can be implemented in most buildings. Other physical security measures, such as increased security personnel or package x-ray equipment, are more costly or may inconvenience users substantially. These measures should be implemented when merited after consideration of the threat and consequences of a terrorist attack. Building owners and managers should be familiar with their buildings and understand what assets require protection and what characteristics about the building or its occupants make it a potential target. By first assessing the vulnerabilities of facilities, building owners and managers can address physical security in an effective manner. While the identification and resolution of building vulnerabilities will be specific to each building, some physical security actions are applicable to many building types. These include: *1. PREVENT ACCESS TO OUTDOOR AIR INTAKES. One of the most important steps in protecting a building's indoor environment is the security of the outdoor air intakes. Outdoor air enters the building through these intakes and is distributed throughout the building by the HVAC system. Introducing CBR agents into the outdoor air intakes allows a terrorist to use the HVAC system as a means of dispersing the agent throughout a building. Publicly accessible outdoor air intakes located at or below ground level are at most risk-due partly to their accessibility (which also makes visual or audible identification easier) and partly because most CBR agent releases near a building will be close to the ground and may remain there. Securing the outdoor air intakes is a critical line of defense in limiting an external CBR attack on a building.\nRelocate outdoor air intake vents. Relocating accessible air intakes to a publicly inaccessible location is preferable. Ideally, the intake should be located on a secure roof or high sidewall. The lowest edge of the outdoor air intakes should be placed at the highest feasible level above the ground or above any nearby accessible level (i.e. adjacent retaining walls, loading docks, handrail). These measures are also beneficial in limiting the inadvertent introduction of other types of contaminants, such as landscaping chemicals, into the building.\nExtend outdoor air intakes. If relocation of outdoor air intakes is not feasible, intake extensions can be constructed without creating adverse effects on HVAC performance. Depending upon budget, time, or the perceived threat, the intake extensions may be temporary or constructed in a permanent, architecturally compatible design. The goal is to minimize public accessibility. In general, this means the higher the extensions, the better-as long as other design constraints (excessive pressure loss, dynamic and static loads on structure) are appropriately considered. An extension height of 12 feet (3.7 m) will place the intake out of reach of individuals without some assistance. Also, the entrance to the intake should be covered with a sloped metal mesh to reduce the threat of objects being tossed into the intake. A minimum slope of 45˚is generally adequate. Extension height should be increased where existing platforms or building features (i.e. loading docks, retaining walls) might provide access to the outdoor air intakes.\n\n【10】 #Establish a security zone around outdoor air intakes.\nPhysically inaccessible outdoor air intakes are the preferred protection strategy. When outdoor air intakes are publicly accessible and relocation or physical extensions are not viable options, perimeter barriers that prevent public access to outdoor air intake areas may be an effective alternative. Iron fencing or similar see-through barriers that will not obscure visual detection of terrorist activities or a deposited CBR source are preferred. The restricted area should also include an open buffer zone between the public areas and the intake louvers. Thus, individuals attempting to enter these protected areas will be more conspicuous to security personnel and the public. Monitoring the buffer zone by physical security, closedcircuit television (CCTV), security lighting, or intrusion detection sensors will enhance this protective approach. To prevent widespread dispersion of a contaminant released within lobbies, mailrooms, and loading docks, their HVAC systems should be isolated and the areas maintained at a negative pressure relative to the rest of the building, but at positive pressure relative to the outdoors. Physical isolation of these areas (well-sealed floor to roof-deck walls, sealed wall penetrations) is critical to maintaining the pressure differential and requires special attention to ensure airtight boundaries between these areas and adjacent spaces. In some building designs (those having lobbies with elevator access, for example), establishing a negative pressure differential will present a challenge. A qualified HVAC professional can assist in determining if the recommended isolation is feasible for a given building. In addition, lobbies, mailrooms, and loading docks should not share a return-air system or return pathway (e.g. ceiling plenum) with other areas of the building. Some of these measures are more feasible for new construction or buildings undergoing major renovation.\nBuilding access from lobby areas should be limited by security checks of individuals and packages prior to their entry into secure areas. Lobby isolation is particularly critical in buildings where the main lobbies are open to the public. Similar checks of incoming mail should also occur before its conveyance into the secure building areas. Side entry doors that circumvent established security checkpoints should be strictly controlled. 9. GENERAL BUILDING PHYSICAL SECURITY UPGRADES. In addition to the security measures for HVAC and other building operations described earlier, physical security upgrades can enhance the overall security of a building. A building or building complex might have security fencing and controlled access points. Some buildings such as museums are, by their very nature, openly accessible to the public. However, even in these buildings, areas such as mechanical rooms need to remain off-limits to unauthorized individuals. Unless the building is regarded as open to the general public, owners and managers should consider not allowing visitors outside the lobby area without an escort. Layered levels of security access should be considered. For example, entry to a hospital's patient care areas could be less strict than to hospital laboratories, and successively more strict for other areas, such as ventilation control rooms. Physical security is of prime concern in lobby areas.\n\n【11】 #Ventilation and Filtration\nHVAC systems and their components should be evaluated with respect to how they impact vulnerability to the introduction of CBR agents. Relevant issues include the HVAC system controls, the ability of the HVAC system to purge the building, the efficiency of installed filters, the capacity of the system relative to potential filter upgrades, and the significance of uncontrolled leakage into the building. Another consideration is the vulnerability of the HVAC system and components themselves, particularly when the facility is open to the public. For buildings under secure access, interior components may be considered less vulnerable, depending upon the perceived threat and the confidence in the level of security. Increasing filter efficiency is one of the few measures that can be implemented in advance to reduce the consequences of both an interior and exterior release of a particulate CBR agent. However, the decision to increase efficiency should be made cautiously, with a careful understanding of the protective limitations resulting from the upgrade. The filtration needs of a building should be assessed with a view to implementing the highest filtration efficiency that is compatible with the installed HVAC system and its required operating parameters. In general, increased filter efficiency will provide benefits to the indoor environmental quality of the building. However, the increased protection from CBR aerosols will occur only if the filtration efficiency increase applies to the particle size range and physical state of the CBR contaminant. It is important to note that particulate air filters are used for biological and radiological particles and are not effective for gases and vapors typical of chemical attacks. These types of compounds require adsorbent filters (i.e. activated carbon or other sorbent-type media) and result in substantial initial and recurring costs.\nUpgrading filtration is not as simple as merely replacing a low-efficiency filter with a higher efficiency one. Typically, higher efficiency filters have a higher pressure loss, which will result in some airflow reduction through the system. The magnitude of the reduction is dependent on the design and capacity of the HVAC system. If the airflow reduction is substantial, it may result in inadequate ventilation, reductions in heating and cooling capacity, or potentially frozen coils. To minimize pressure loss, deep pleated filters or filter banks having a larger nominal inlet area might be feasible alternatives, if space allows. Also, high-pressure losses can sometimes be avoided by using prefilters or more frequent filter changeouts. Pressure loss associated with adsorbent filters can be even greater.\nThe integrity of the HVAC system's filter rack or frame system has a major impact upon the installed filtration efficiency.\nReducing the leakage of unfiltered air around filters, caused by a poor seal between the filter and the frame, may be as important as increasing filter efficiency. If filter bypass proves to be significant, corrective actions will be needed. Some highefficiency filter systems have better seals and frames constructed to reduce bypass. During an upgrade to higher efficiency filters, the HVAC and filtration systems should be evaluated by a qualified HVAC professional to verify proper performance.\nWhile higher filtration efficiency is encouraged and should provide indoor air quality benefits beyond an increased protection from CBR terrorist events, the overall cost of filtration should be evaluated. Filtration costs include the periodic cost of the filter media, the labor cost to remove and replace filters, and the fan energy cost required to overcome the pressure loss of the filters. While higher efficiency filters tend to have a higher life cycle cost than lower efficiency filters, this is not always the case. With some higher efficiency filter systems, higher acquisition and energy costs can be offset by longer filter life and a reduced labor cost for filter replacements. Also, improved filtration generally keeps heating and cooling coils cleaner and, thus, may reduce energy costs through improvements in heat transfer efficiency. However, when high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters and/or activated carbon adsorbers are used, the overall costs will generally increase substantially.\n3. DUCTED AND NON-DUCTED RETURN AIR SYSTEMS. Ducted returns offer limited access points to introduce a CBR agent. The return vents can be placed in conspicuous locations, reducing the risk of an agent being secretly introduced into the return system. Non-ducted return air systems commonly use hallways or spaces above dropped ceilings as a return-air path or plenum. CBR agents introduced at any location above the dropped ceiling in a ceiling plenum return system will most likely migrate back to the HVAC unit and, without highly efficient filtration for the particular agent, redistribute to occupied areas. Buildings should be designed to minimize mixing between air-handling zones, which can be partially accomplished by limiting shared returns. Where ducted returns are not feasible or warranted, hold-down clips may be used for accessible areas of dropped ceilings that serve as the return plenum. This issue is closely related to the isolation of lobbies and mailrooms, as shared returns are a common way for contaminants from these areas to disperse into the rest of the building. These modifications may be more feasible for new building construction or those undergoing major renovation.\n4. LOW-LEAKAGE, FAST-ACTING DAMPERS. Rapid response, such as shutting down an HVAC system, may also involve closing various dampers, especially those controlling the flow of outdoor air (in the event of an exterior CBR release). When the HVAC system is turned off, the building pressure compared to outdoors may still be negative, drawing outdoor air into the building via many leakage pathways, including the HVAC system. Consideration should be given to installing low leakage dampers to minimize this flow pathway. Damper leakage ratings are available as part of the manufacturer's specifications and range from ultra-low to normal categories. Assuming that you have some warning prior to a direct CBR release, the speed with which these dampers respond to a \"close\" instruction can also be important. From a protective standpoint, dampers that respond quickly are preferred over dampers that might take 30 seconds or more to respond.\n5. BUILDING AIR TIGHTNESS. Significant quantities of air can enter a building by means of infiltration through unintentional leakage paths in the building envelope. Such leakage is of more concern for an exterior CBR release at some distance from a building, such as a large-scale attack, than for a directed terrorist act. The reduction of air leakage is a matter of tight building construction in combination with building pressurization. While building pressurization may be a valuable CBR-protection strategy in any building, it is much more likely to be effective in a tight building. However, to be effective, filtration of building supply air must be appropriate for the CBR agent introduced. Although increasing the air tightness of an existing building can be more challenging than during new construction, it should still be seriously considered.\n\n【12】 #CONCLUSIONS\nReducing a building's vulnerability to an airborne chemical, biological, or radiological attack requires a comprehensive approach. Decisions concerning which protective measures to implement should be based upon the threat profile and a security assessment of the building and its occupants. While physical security is the first layer of defense, other issues must also be addressed. Preventing possible terrorist access to outdoor air intakes and mechanical rooms and developing CBR-contingent emergency response plans should be addressed as soon as possible. Additional measures can provide further protection. A building security assessment should be done to determine the necessity of additional measures. Some items, such as improved maintenance and HVAC system controls, may also provide a payback in operating costs and/or improved building air quality. As new building designs or modifications are considered, designers should consider that practical CBR sensors may soon become available. Building system design features that are capable of incorporating this rapidly evolving technology will most likely offer a greater level of protection. While it is not possible to completely eliminate the risk of a CBR terrorist attack, several measures can be taken to reduce the likelihood and consequences of such an attack. Many of the recommendations presented here are ones that can be implemented reasonably quickly and cost effectively. Many are applicable to both new construction and existing buildings, although some may be more feasible than others. Building owners and managers should assess buildings by looking first for those items that are most vulnerable and can be addressed easily. Additional measures should be implemented as feasible. The goals are to make your building an unattractive target for a CBR attack and to maximize occupant protection in the event that such an attack occurs.\n\n【13】 #For Additional Information\nSeveral organizations have developed guidance to assist building owners and operators in addressing issues related to building security and CBR terrorist attacks. Many other organizations have guidance that addresses security needs and disaster response plans for events such as fire, natural disasters, and bomb threats. While this latter guidance may not specifically address the terrorist threat to HVAC systems, readers may find portions of the information beneficial in establishing their own building's emergency response plans.\nThe following list is not all-inclusive. Available guidance is updated regularly as additional organizations and evolving technologies identify new protective recommendations.\n\n【14】 #Organization", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

The effectiveness of Levofloxacin is based on plasma concentrations achieved in humans, a surrogate endpoint reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. Levofloxacin has not been tested in humans for the post-exposure prevention of inhalation anthrax. The safety of Levofloxacin in adults for durations of therapy beyond 28 days or in pediatric patients for durations of therapy beyond 14 days has not been studied. Prolonged Levofloxacin therapy should only be used when the benefit outweighs the risk.\n\n【8】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Levofloxacin in pediatric patients.\n\n【9】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Levofloxacin in pediatric patients.\n\n【10】 #Contraindications\nLevofloxacin is contraindicated in persons with known hypersensitivity to levofloxacin, or other quinolone antibacterials.\n\n【11】 ### Tendinopathy and Tendon Rupture=\n- Fluoroquinolones, including Levofloxacin, are associated with an increased risk of tendinitis and tendon rupture in all ages. This adverse reaction most frequently involves the Achilles tendon, and rupture of the Achilles tendon may require surgical repair. Tendinitis and tendon rupture in the rotator cuff (the shoulder), the hand, the biceps, the thumb, and other tendon sites have also been reported. The risk of developing fluoroquinolone-associated tendinitis and tendon rupture is further increased in older patients usually over 60 years of age, in those taking corticosteroid drugs, and in patients with kidney, heart or lung transplants. Factors, in addition to age and corticosteroid use, that may independently increase the risk of tendon rupture include strenuous physical activity, renal failure, and previous tendon disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis. Tendinitis and tendon rupture have been reported in patients taking fluoroquinolones who do not have the above risk factors. Tendon rupture can occur during or after completion of therapy; cases occurring up to several months after completion of therapy have been reported. Levofloxacin should be discontinued if the patient experiences pain, swelling, inflammation or rupture of a tendon. Patients should be advised to rest at the first sign of tendinitis or tendon rupture, and to contact their healthcare provider regarding changing to a non-quinolone antimicrobial drug.\n- Fluoroquinolones, including Levofloxacin, have neuromuscular blocking activity and may exacerbate muscle weakness in persons with myasthenia gravis. Postmarketing serious adverse events, including deaths and requirement for ventilatory support, have been associated with fluoroquinolone use in persons with myasthenia gravis. Avoid Levofloxacin in patients with a known history of myasthenia gravis.\n- Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity and/or anaphylactic reactions have been reported in patients receiving therapy with fluoroquinolones, including Levofloxacin. These reactions often occur following the first dose. Some reactions have been accompanied by cardiovascular collapse, hypotension/shock, seizure, loss of consciousness, tingling, angioedema (including tongue, laryngeal, throat, or facial edema/swelling), airway obstruction (including bronchospasm, shortness of breath, and acute respiratory distress), dyspnea, urticaria, itching, and other serious skin reactions. Levofloxacin should be discontinued immediately at the first appearance of a skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity. Serious acute hypersensitivity reactions may require treatment with epinephrine and other resuscitative measures, including oxygen, intravenous fluids, antihistamines, corticosteroids, pressor amines, and airway management, as clinically indicated.\n- fever, rash, or severe dermatologic reactions (e.g. toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome);\n- vasculitis; arthralgia; myalgia; serum sickness;\n- allergic pneumonitis;\n- interstitial nephritis; acute renal insufficiency or failure;\n- hepatitis; jaundice; acute hepatic necrosis or failure;\n- anemia, including hemolytic and aplastic; thrombocytopenia, including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura; leukopenia; agranulocytosis; pancytopenia; and/or other hematologic abnormalities.\n- The drug should be discontinued immediately at the first appearance of skin rash, jaundice, or any other sign of hypersensitivity and supportive measures instituted.\n- Post-marketing reports of severe hepatotoxicity (including acute hepatitis and fatal events) have been received for patients treated with Levofloxacin. No evidence of serious drug-associated hepatotoxicity was detected in clinical trials of over 7,000 patients. Severe hepatotoxicity generally occurred within 14 days of initiation of therapy and most cases occurred within 6 days. Most cases of severe hepatotoxicity were not associated with hypersensitivity. The majority of fatal hepatotoxicity reports occurred in patients 65 years of age or older and most were not associated with hypersensitivity. Levofloxacin should be discontinued immediately if the patient develops signs and symptoms of hepatitis.\n- Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including Levofloxacin, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile.\n- C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.\n- If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.\n- Moderate to severe photosensitivity/phototoxicity reactions, the latter of which may manifest as exaggerated sunburn reactions (e.g. burning, erythema, exudation, vesicles, blistering, edema) involving areas exposed to light (typically the face, \"V\" area of the neck, extensor surfaces of the forearms, dorsa of the hands), can be associated with the use of fluoroquinolones after sun or UV light exposure. Therefore, excessive exposure to these sources of light should be avoided. Drug therapy should be discontinued if photosensitivity/phototoxicity occurs.\n- Prescribing Levofloxacin in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria\n\n【12】 ## Clinical Trials Experience\n- Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.\n- The data described below reflect exposure to Levofloxacin in 7537 patients in 29 pooled Phase 3 clinical trials. The population studied had a mean age of 50 years (approximately 74% of the population was < 65 years of age), 50% were male, 71% were Caucasian, 19% were Black. Patients were treated with Levofloxacin for a wide variety of infectious diseases. Patients received Levofloxacin doses of 750 mg once daily, 250 mg once daily, or 500 mg once or twice daily. Treatment duration was usually 3–14 days, and the mean number of days on therapy was 10 days.\n- Adverse reactions occurring in ≥1% of Levofloxacin-treated patients and less common adverse reactions, occurring in 0 The most common adverse drug reactions (≥3%) are nausea, headache, diarrhea, insomnia, constipation, and dizziness.\n- In clinical trials using multiple-dose therapy, ophthalmologic abnormalities, including cataracts and multiple punctate lenticular opacities, have been noted in patients undergoing treatment with quinolones, including Levofloxacin. The relationship of the drugs to these events is not presently established.\n- Cardiac arrest, Prolonged QT interval, Torsades de pointes, Ventricular tachycardia - Erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome\n- Hypoglycemia - Aplastic anemia, Pancytopenia, Thrombocytopenic purpura - Clostridium difficile-Associated Diarrhea - Hepatitis, Liver failure\n- Anaphylactoid reaction, Hypersensitivity reaction\n- Myasthenia gravis, Exacerbation, Rupture of tendon, Tendinitis - Peripheral neuropathy, Seizure\n- Retinal detachment\n- Acute renal failure\n- Crystalluria and cylindruria have been reported with quinolones, including Levofloxacin. Therefore, adequate hydration of patients receiving Levofloxacin should be maintained to prevent the formation of a highly concentrated urine\n\n【13】 ### Others\n- Development of Drug Resistant Bacteria\n\n【14】 ## Postmarketing Experience\nBecause these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, reliably estimating their frequency or establishing a causal relationship to drug exposure is not always possible.\n\n【15】 #Drug Interactions\n- Antacids, Sucralfate, Metal Cations, Multivitamins\n- Levofloxacin Oral Solution:\nWhile the chelation by divalent cations is less marked than with other fluoroquinolones, concurrent administration of Levofloxacin Oral Solution with antacids containing magnesium, or aluminum, as well as sucralfate, metal cations such as iron, and multivitamin preparations with zinc may interfere with the gastrointestinal absorption of levofloxacin, resulting in systemic levels considerably lower than desired. Tablets with antacids containing magnesium, aluminum, as well as sucralfate, metal cations such as iron, and multivitamin preparations with zinc or didanosine may substantially interfere with the gastrointestinal absorption of levofloxacin, resulting in systemic levels considerably lower than desired. These agents should be taken at least two hours before or two hours after oral Levofloxacin administration.\n- No significant effect of Levofloxacin on the peak plasma concentrations, AUC, and other disposition parameters for R- and S- warfarin was detected in a clinical study involving healthy volunteers. Similarly, no apparent effect of warfarin on levofloxacin absorption and disposition was observed. However, there have been reports during the postmarketing experience in patients that Levofloxacin enhances the effects of warfarin. Elevations of the prothrombin time in the setting of concurrent warfarin and Levofloxacin use have been associated with episodes of bleeding. Prothrombin time, International Normalized Ratio (INR), or other suitable anticoagulation tests should be closely monitored if Levofloxacin is administered concomitantly with warfarin. Patients should also be monitored for evidence of bleeding.\n- Disturbances of blood glucose, including hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, have been reported in patients treated concomitantly with fluoroquinolones and an antidiabetic agent. Therefore, careful monitoring of blood glucose is recommended when these agents are co-administered.\n- The concomitant administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug with a fluoroquinolone, including Levofloxacin, may increase the risk of CNS stimulation and convulsive seizures.\n- No significant effect of probenecid or cimetidine on the Cmax of levofloxacin was observed in a clinical study involving healthy volunteers. The AUC and t½ of levofloxacin were higher while CL/F and CLR were lower during concomitant treatment of Levofloxacin with probenecid or cimetidine compared to Levofloxacin alone. However, these changes do not warrant dosage adjustment for Levofloxacin when probenecid or cimetidine is co-administered.\n- Some fluoroquinolones, including Levofloxacin, may produce false-positive urine screening results for opiates using commercially available immunoassay kits. Confirmation of positive opiate screens by more specific methods may be necessary.\n\n【16】 ### Pregnancy\nPregnancy Category (FDA): C\n- Levofloxacin was not teratogenic in rats at oral doses as high as 810 mg/kg/day which corresponds to 9.4 times the highest recommended human dose based upon relative body surface area, or at intravenous doses as high as 160 mg/kg/day corresponding to 1.9 times the highest recommended human dose based upon relative body surface area. The oral dose of 810 mg/kg/day to rats caused decreased fetal body weight and increased fetal mortality. No teratogenicity was observed when rabbits were dosed orally as high as 50 mg/kg/day which corresponds to 1.1 times the highest recommended human dose based upon relative body surface area, or when dosed intravenously as high as 25 mg/kg/day, corresponding to 0.5 times the highest recommended human dose based upon relative body surface area.\n- There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Levofloxacin should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\n- Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) Pregnancy Category\n- There is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Levofloxacin in women who are pregnant.\n\n【17】 ### Labor and Delivery\nThere is no FDA guidance on use of Levofloxacin during labor and delivery.\n\n【18】 ### Nursing Mothers\n- Based on data on other fluoroquinolones and very limited data on Levofloxacin, it can be presumed that levofloxacin will be excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from Levofloxacin in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\n\n【19】 ### Pediatric Use\n- Quinolones, including levofloxacin, cause arthropathy and osteochondrosis in juvenile animals of several species.\n- Inhalational Anthrax (Post-Exposure)\n- Levofloxacin is indicated in pediatric patients 6 months of age and older, for inhalational anthrax (post-exposure). The risk-benefit assessment indicates that administration of levofloxacin to pediatric patients is appropriate. The safety of levofloxacin in pediatric patients treated for more than 14 days has not been studied.\n- Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of six months have not been established.\n- In clinical trials, 1534 children (6 months to 16 years of age) were treated with oral and intravenous Levofloxacin. Children 6 months to 5 years of age received Levofloxacin 10 mg/kg twice a day and children greater than 5 years of age received 10 mg/kg once a day (maximum 500 mg per day) for approximately 10 days.\n- A subset of children in the clinical trials (1340 Levofloxacin-treated and 893 non-fluoroquinolone-treated) enrolled in a prospective, long-term surveillance study to assess the incidence of protocol-defined musculoskeletal disorders (arthralgia, arthritis, tendinopathy, gait abnormality) during 60 days and 1 year following the first dose of the study drug\n\n【20】 ### Geriatic Use\n- Geriatric patients are at increased risk for developing severe tendon disorders including tendon rupture when being treated with a fluoroquinolone such as Levofloxacin. This risk is further increased in patients receiving concomitant corticosteroid therapy. Tendinitis or tendon rupture can involve the Achilles, hand, shoulder, or other tendon sites and can occur during or after completion of therapy; cases occurring up to several months after fluoroquinolone treatment have been reported. Caution should be used when prescribing Levofloxacin to elderly patients especially those on corticosteroids. Patients should be informed of this potential side effect and advised to discontinue Levofloxacin and contact their healthcare provider if any symptoms of tendinitis or tendon rupture occur.\n- In Phase 3 clinical trials, 1,945 Levofloxacin-treated patients (26%) were ≥ 65 years of age. Of these, 1,081 patients (14%) were between the ages of 65 and 74 and 864 patients (12%) were 75 years or older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.\n- Severe, and sometimes fatal, cases of hepatotoxicity have been reported post-marketing in association with Levofloxacin. The majority of fatal hepatotoxicity reports occurred in patients 65 years of age or older and most were not associated with hypersensitivity. Levofloxacin should be discontinued immediately if the patient develops signs and symptoms of hepatitis.\n- Elderly patients may be more susceptible to drug-associated effects on the QT interval. Therefore, precaution should be taken when using Levofloxacin with concomitant drugs that can result in prolongation of the QT interval (e.g. Class IA or Class III antiarrhythmics) or in patients with risk factors for torsade de pointes (e.g. known QT prolongation, uncorrected hypokalemia).\n- The pharmacokinetic properties of levofloxacin in younger adults and elderly adults do not differ significantly when creatinine clearance is taken into consideration. However, since the drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.\n\n【21】 ### Gender\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Levofloxacin with respect to specific gender populations.\n\n【22】 ### Race\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Levofloxacin with respect to specific racial populations.\n\n【23】 ### Renal Impairment\n- Clearance of levofloxacin is substantially reduced and plasma elimination half-life is substantially prolonged in patients with impaired renal function (creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min), requiring dosage adjustment in such patients to avoid accumulation. Neither hemodialysis nor continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) is effective in removal of levofloxacin from the body, indicating that supplemental doses of Levofloxacin are not required following hemodialysis or CAPD.\n\n【24】 ### Hepatic Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Levofloxacin in patients with hepatic impairment.\n\n【25】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Levofloxacin in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n\n【26】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\nThere is no FDA guidance one the use of Levofloxacin in patients who are immunocompromised.\n\n【27】 ### Administration\n- Oral solution\n\n【28】 ### Monitoring\n- Blood Glucose Disturbances:\n- As with other fluoroquinolones, disturbances of blood glucose, including symptomatic hyperglycemia- and hypoglycemia, have been reported with Levofloxacin, usually in diabetic patients receiving concomitant treatment with an oral hypoglycemic agent (e.g. glyburide) or with insulin. In these patients, careful monitoring of blood glucose is recommended.\n- Warfarin:\n- No significant effect of Levofloxacin on the peak plasma concentrations, AUC, and other disposition parameters for R- and S- warfarin was detected in a clinical study involving healthy volunteers. Similarly, no apparent effect of warfarin on levofloxacin absorption and disposition was observed. However, there have been reports during the postmarketing experience in patients that Levofloxacin enhances the effects of warfarin. Elevations of the prothrombin time in the setting of concurrent warfarin and Levofloxacin use have been associated with episodes of bleeding. Prothrombin time, International Normalized Ratio (INR), or other suitable anticoagulation tests should be closely monitored if Levofloxacin is administered concomitantly with warfarin. Patients should also be monitored for evidence of bleeding.\n- Antidiabetic Agents:\n- Theophylline:\n\n【29】 #IV Compatibility\nThere is limited information regarding IV Compatibility of Levofloxacin (oral) in the drug label.\n\n【30】 ## Acute Overdose\n- In the event of an acute overdosage, the stomach should be emptied. The patient should be observed and appropriate hydration maintained. Levofloxacin is not efficiently removed by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis.\n- Levofloxacin exhibits a low potential for acute toxicity. Mice, rats, dogs and monkeys exhibited the following clinical signs after receiving a single high dose of Levofloxacin: ataxia, ptosis, decreased locomotor activity, dyspnea, prostration, tremors, and convulsions. Doses in excess of 1500 mg/kg orally and 250 mg/kg IV produced significant mortality in rodents.\n\n【31】 ## Chronic Overdose\nThere is limited information regarding Chronic Overdose of Levofloxacin in the drug label.\n\n【32】 ## Mechanism of Action\n- Levofloxacin is a member of the fluoroquinolone class of antibacterial agents and acts by inhibiting DNA gyrase (bacterial topoisomerase II) which is an enzyme required for DNA replication, transcription, repair, and recombination.\n\n【33】 ## Structure\n- Levofloxacin is a synthetic broad-spectrum antibacterial agent for oral administration. Chemically, levofloxacin, a chiral fluorinated carboxyquinolone, is the pure (-)-(S)-enantiomer of the racemic drug substance ofloxacin. The chemical name is (-)-(S)-9-fluoro-2,3-dihydro-3-methyl-10-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-7-oxo-7H-pyrido-1,4-benzoxazine-6-carboxylic acid hemihydrate.\n- The empirical formula is C18H20FN3O4 - ½ H2O and the molecular weight is 370.38. Levofloxacin is a light yellowish-white to yellow-white crystal or crystalline powder. The molecule exists as a zwitterion at the pH conditions in the small intestine.\nThe data demonstrate that from pH 0.6 to 5.8, the solubility of levofloxacin is essentially constant (approximately 100 mg/mL). Levofloxacin is considered soluble to freely soluble in this pH range, as defined by USP nomenclature. Above pH 5.8, the solubility increases rapidly to its maximum at pH 6.7 (272 mg/mL) and is considered freely soluble in this range. Above pH 6.7, the solubility decreases and reaches a minimum value (about 50 mg/mL) at a pH of approximately 6.9.\nLevofloxacin has the potential to form stable coordination compounds with many metal ions. This in vitro chelation potential has the following formation order: Al+3>Cu+2>Zn+2>Mg+2>Ca+2.\n\n【34】 ## Pharmacodynamics\nThere is limited information regarding Levofloxacin (oral) Pharmacodynamics in the drug label.\n\n【35】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n\n【36】 - Levofloxacin is rapidly and essentially completely absorbed after oral administration. Peak plasma concentrations are usually attained one to two hours after oral dosing. The absolute bioavailability of levofloxacin from a 500 mg tablet and a 750 mg tablet of Levofloxacin are both approximately 99%, demonstrating complete oral absorption of levofloxacin. Following a single intravenous dose of Levofloxacin to healthy volunteers, the mean ± SD peak plasma concentration attained was 6.2 ± 1.0 mcg/mL after a 500 mg dose infused over 60 minutes and 11.5 ± 4.0 mcg/mL after a 750 mg dose infused over 90 minutes. Levofloxacin Oral Solution and Tablet formulations are bioequivalent.\n- Levofloxacin pharmacokinetics are linear and predictable after single and multiple oral or IV dosing regimens. Steady-state conditions are reached within 48 hours following a 500 mg or 750 mg once-daily dosage regimen. The mean ± SD peak and trough plasma concentrations attained following multiple once-daily oral dosage regimens were approximately 5.7 ± 1.4 and 0.5 ± 0.2 mcg/mL after the 500 mg doses, and 8.6 ± 1.9 and 1.1 ± 0.4 mcg/mL after the 750 mg doses, respectively. The mean ± SD peak and trough plasma concentrations attained following multiple once-daily IV regimens were approximately 6.4 ± 0.8 and 0.6 ± 0.2 mcg/mL after the 500 mg doses, and 12.1 ± 4.1 and 1.3 ± 0.71 mcg/mL after the 750 mg doses, respectively. Oral administration of a 500 mg dose of Levofloxacin with food prolongs the time to peak concentration by approximately 1 hour and decreases the peak concentration by approximately 14% following tablet and approximately 25% following oral solution administration. Therefore, Levofloxacin Tablets can be administered without regard to food. It is recommended that Levofloxacin Oral Solution be taken 1 hour before or 2 hours after eating.\n- In vitro, over a clinically relevant range (1 to 10 mcg/mL) of serum/plasma levofloxacin concentrations, levofloxacin is approximately 24 to 38% bound to serum proteins across all species studied, as determined by the equilibrium dialysis method. Levofloxacin is mainly bound to serum albumin in humans. Levofloxacin binding to serum proteins is independent of the drug concentration.\n- Clearance of levofloxacin is substantially reduced and plasma elimination half-life is substantially prolonged in adult patients with impaired renal function (creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min), requiring dosage adjustment in such patients to avoid accumulation. Neither hemodialysis nor continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) is effective in removal of levofloxacin from the body, indicating that supplemental doses of Levofloxacin are not required following hemodialysis or CAPD.\n- Pharmacokinetic studies in hepatically impaired patients have not been conducted. Due to the limited extent of levofloxacin metabolism, the pharmacokinetics of levofloxacin are not expected to be affected by hepatic impairment.\n\n【37】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\n- In a lifetime bioassay in rats, levofloxacin exhibited no carcinogenic potential following daily dietary administration for 2 years; the highest dose (100 mg/kg/day) was 1.4 times the highest recommended human dose (750 mg) based upon relative body surface area. Levofloxacin did not shorten the time to tumor development of UV-induced skin tumors in hairless albino (Skh-1) mice at any levofloxacin dose level and was therefore not photo-carcinogenic under conditions of this study. Dermal levofloxacin concentrations in the hairless mice ranged from 25 to 42 mcg/g at the highest levofloxacin dose level (300 mg/kg/day) used in the photo-carcinogenicity study. By comparison, dermal levofloxacin concentrations in human subjects receiving 750 mg of Levofloxacin averaged approximately 11.8 mcg/g at Cmax.\n- Levofloxacin was not mutagenic in the following assays: Ames bacterial mutation assay (S. typhimurium and E. coli), CHO/HGPRT forward mutation assay, mouse micronucleus test, mouse dominant lethal test, rat unscheduled DNA synthesis assay, and the mouse sister chromatid exchange assay. It was positive in the in vitro chromosomal aberration (CHL cell line) and sister chromatid exchange (CHL/IU cell line) assays.\n- Levofloxacin and other quinolones have been shown to cause arthropathy in immature animals of most species tested. In immature dogs (4–5 months old), oral doses of 10 mg/kg/day for 7 days and intravenous doses of 4 mg/kg/day for 14 days of levofloxacin resulted in arthropathic lesions. Administration at oral doses of 300 mg/kg/day for 7 days and intravenous doses of 60 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks produced arthropathy in juvenile rats. Three-month old beagle dogs dosed orally with levofloxacin at 40 mg/kg/day exhibited clinically severe arthrotoxicity resulting in the termination of dosing at Day 8 of a 14-day dosing routine. Slight musculoskeletal clinical effects, in the absence of gross pathological or histopathological effects, resulted from the lowest dose level of 2.5 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.2-fold the pediatric dose based upon AUC comparisons). Synovitis and articular cartilage lesions were observed at the 10 and 40 mg/kg dose levels (approximately 0.7-fold and 2.4-fold the pediatric dose, respectively, based on AUC comparisons). Articular cartilage gross pathology and histopathology persisted to the end of the 18-week recovery period for those dogs from the 10 and 40 mg/kg/day dose levels.\n- When tested in a mouse ear swelling bioassay, levofloxacin exhibited phototoxicity similar in magnitude to ofloxacin, but less phototoxicity than other quinolones.\n- In mice, the CNS stimulatory effect of quinolones is enhanced by concomitant administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.\n- In dogs, levofloxacin administered at 6 mg/kg or higher by rapid intravenous injection produced hypotensive effects. These effects were considered to be related to histamine release.\n\n【38】 #Clinical Studies\n- Adult patients with clinically and radiologically documented nosocomial pneumonia were enrolled in a multicenter, randomized, open-label study comparing intravenous Levofloxacin (750 mg once daily) followed by oral Levofloxacin (750 mg once daily) for a total of 7–15 days to intravenous imipenem/cilastatin (500–1000 mg every 6–8 hours daily) followed by oral ciprofloxacin (750 mg every 12 hours daily) for a total of 7–15 days. Levofloxacin-treated patients received an average of 7 days of intravenous therapy (range: 1–16 days); comparator-treated patients received an average of 8 days of intravenous therapy (range: 1–19 days).\n- Overall, in the clinically and microbiologically evaluable population, adjunctive therapy was empirically initiated at study entry in 56 of 93 (60.2%) patients in the Levofloxacin arm and 53 of 94 (56.4%) patients in the comparator arm. The average duration of adjunctive therapy was 7 days in the Levofloxacin arm and 7 days in the comparator. In clinically and microbiologically evaluable patients with documented Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, 15 of 17 (88.2%) received ceftazidime (N=11) or piperacillin/tazobactam (N=4) in the Levofloxacin arm and 16 of 17 (94.1%) received an aminoglycoside in the comparator arm. Overall, in clinically and microbiologically evaluable patients, vancomycin was added to the treatment regimen of 37 of 93 (39.8%) patients in the Levofloxacin arm and 28 of 94 (29.8%) patients in the comparator arm for suspected methicillin-resistant S. aureus infection.\n- Clinical success rates in clinically and microbiologicallyevaluable patients at the post-therapy visit (primary study endpoint assessed on day 3–15 after completing therapy) were 58.1% for Levofloxacin and 60.6% for comparator. The 95% CI for the difference of response rates (Levofloxacin minus comparator) was . The microbiological eradication rates at the posttherapy visit were 66.7% for Levofloxacin and 60.6% for comparator. The 95% CI for the difference of eradication rates (Levofloxacin minus comparator) was\n- Adult inpatients and outpatients with a diagnosis of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia were evaluated in 2 pivotal clinical studies. In the first study, 590 patients were enrolled in a prospective, multi-center, unblinded randomized trial comparing Levofloxacin 500 mg once daily orally or intravenously for 7 to 14 days to ceftriaxone 1 to 2 grams intravenously once or in equally divided doses twice daily followed by cefuroxime axetil 500 mg orally twice daily for a total of 7 to 14 days. Patients assigned to treatment with the control regimen were allowed to receive erythromycin (or doxycycline if intolerant of erythromycin) if an infection due to atypical pathogens was suspected or proven. Clinical and microbiologic evaluations were performed during treatment, 5 to 7 days posttherapy, and 3 to 4 weeks posttherapy. Clinical success (cure plus improvement) with Levofloxacin at 5 to 7 days posttherapy, the primary efficacy variable in this study, was superior (95%) to the control group (83%). The 95% CI for the difference of response rates (Levofloxacin minus comparator) was . In the second study, 264 patients were enrolled in a prospective, multi-center, non-comparative trial of 500 mg Levofloxacin administered orally or intravenously once daily for 7 to 14 days. Clinical success for clinically evaluable patients was 93%. For both studies, the clinical success rate in patients with atypical pneumonia due to Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophila were 96%, 96%, and 70%, respectively\n- Community-Acquired Pneumonia Due to Multi-Drug Resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae\n- Levofloxacin was effective for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia caused by multi-drug resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (MDRSP). MDRSP isolates are isolates resistant to two or more of the following antibacterials: penicillin (MIC ≥2 mcg/mL), 2nd generation cephalosporins (e.g. cefuroxime, macrolides, tetracyclines and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole). Of 40 microbiologically evaluable patients with MDRSP isolates, 38 patients (95.0%) achieved clinical and bacteriologic success at post-therapy\n- Not all isolates were resistant to all antimicrobial classes tested\n- To evaluate the safety and efficacy of the higher dose and shorter course of Levofloxacin, 528 outpatient and hospitalized adults with clinically and radiologically determined mild to severe community-acquired pneumonia were evaluated in a double-blind, randomized, prospective, multicenter study comparing Levofloxacin 750 mg, IV or orally, every day for five days or Levofloxacin 500 mg IV or orally, every day for 10 days.\n- Rates of clinical success by pathogen in the microbiologically evaluable population who had specimens obtained by antral tap at study entry showed comparable results for the five- and ten-day regimens at the test-of-cure visit 22 days post treatment .\n- Three hundred ninety-nine patients were enrolled in an open-label, randomized, comparative study for complicated skin and skin structure infections. The patients were randomized to receive either Levofloxacin 750 mg once daily (IV followed by oral), or an approved comparator for a median of 10 ± 4.7 days. As is expected in complicated skin and skin structure infections, surgical procedures were performed in the Levofloxacin and comparator groups. Surgery (incision and drainage or debridement) was performed on 45% of the Levofloxacin-treated patients and 44% of the comparator-treated patients, either shortly before or during antibiotic treatment and formed an integral part of therapy for this indication.\n- Among those who could be evaluated clinically 2–5 days after completion of study drug, overall success rates (improved or cured) were 116/138 (84.1%) for patients treated with Levofloxacin and 106/132 (80.3%) for patients treated with the comparator.\n- Success rates varied with the type of diagnosis ranging from 68% in patients with infected ulcers to 90% in patients with infected wounds and abscesses. These rates were equivalent to those seen with comparator drugs.\n- Eradication rates for S. epidermidis when found with other co-pathogens are consistent with rates seen in pure isolates.\n\n【39】 - In adults, the safety of Levofloxacin for treatment durations of up to 28 days is well characterized. However, information pertaining to extended use at 500 mg daily up to 60 days is limited. Prolonged Levofloxacin therapy in adults should only be used when the benefit outweighs the risk.\n- In pediatric patients, the safety of levofloxacin for treatment durations of more than 14 days has not been studied. An increased incidence of musculoskeletal adverse events (arthralgia, arthritis, tendinopathy, gait abnormality) compared to controls has been observed in clinical studies with treatment duration of up to 14 days. Long-term safety data, including effects on cartilage, following the administration of levofloxacin to pediatric patients is limited.\n- A placebo-controlled animal study in rhesus monkeys exposed to an inhaled mean dose of 49 LD50 (~2.7 × 106) spores (range 17 – 118 LD50) of B. anthracis (Ames strain) was conducted. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of levofloxacin for the anthrax strain used in this study was 0.125 mcg/mL. In the animals studied, mean plasma concentrations of levofloxacin achieved at expected Tmax (1 hour post-dose) following oral dosing to steady state ranged from 2.79 to 4.87 mcg/mL. Steady state trough concentrations at 24 hours post-dose ranged from 0.107 to 0.164 mcg/mL. Mean (SD) steady state AUC0–24 was 33.4 ± 3.2 mcg.h/mL (range 30.4 to 36.0 mcg.h/mL). Mortality due to anthrax for animals that received a 30 day regimen of oral Levofloxacin beginning 24 hrs post exposure was significantly lower (1/10), compared to the placebo group (9/10) . The one levofloxacin treated animal that died of anthrax did so following the 30-day drug administration period.\n- Efficacy studies of Levofloxacin could not be conducted in humans with pneumonic plague for ethical and feasibility reasons. Therefore, approval of this indication was based on an efficacy study conducted in animals.\n\n【40】 #How Supplied\n- Levofloxacin Oral Solution\n\n【41】 ## Storage\n- Levofloxacin Oral Solution should be stored at 25°C (77°F); excursions permitted to 15° – 30°C (59° to 86°F) .\n\n【42】 #Patient Counseling Information\n- Antibacterial drugs including Levofloxacin should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g. the common cold). When Levofloxacin is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may  decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and  increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by Levofloxacin or other antibacterial drugs in the future.\n- Levofloxacin Oral Solution should be taken 1 hour before or 2 hours after eating. The oral solution should be taken at the same time each day.\n- Patients should drink fluids liberally while taking Levofloxacin to avoid formation of a highly concentrated urine and crystal formation in the urine.\n- Antacids containing magnesium, or aluminum, as well as sucralfate, metal cations such as iron, and multivitamin preparations with zinc or didanosine should be taken at least two hours before or two hours after oral Levofloxacin administration.\n\n【43】 - Exacerbation of Myasthenia Gravis: Patients should inform their physician of any history of myasthenia gravis. Patients should notify their physician if they experience any symptoms of muscle weakness, including respiratory difficulties.\n- Convulsions: Convulsions have been reported in patients taking fluoroquinolones, including Levofloxacin. Patients should notify their physician before taking this drug if they have a history of convulsions.\n- Neurologic Adverse Effects (e.g. dizziness, lightheadedness, increased intracranial pressure): Patients should know how they react to Levofloxacin before they operate an automobile or machinery or engage in other activities requiring mental alertness and coordination. Patients should notify their physician if persistent headache with or without blurred vision occurs.\n- Diarrhea: Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.\n- Prolongation of the QT Interval: Patients should inform their physician of any personal or family history of QT prolongation or proarrhythmic conditions such as hypokalemia, bradycardia, or recent myocardial ischemia; if they are taking any Class IA (quinidine, procainamide), or Class III (amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic agents. Patients should notify their physicians if they have any symptoms of prolongation of the QT interval, including prolonged heart palpitations or a loss of consciousness.\n- Active Ingredient Made in Japan\n- Finished Product Manufactured by:\n- Janssen Pharmaceutica N.V.

When that happens, symptoms of candidiasis appear.\n\n【2】 #Pathophysiology\nCandida albicans and C. glabrata. Less commonly, C.tropicalis, C. parapsilosis, and C. krusei. Rarely, other Candida species.\n\n【3】 #Epidemiology and Demographics\nIt is the fourth most common cause of nosocomial bloodstream infections. Incidence is 8 cases per 100,000 in the general population. Mortality rate is almost 50% with bloodstream and disseminated infection.\n\n【4】 #Risk Factors\nInvasive disease occurs in critically ill patients in intensive-care units, in persons with severe granulocytopenia, and in hematopoietic stem cell and organ transplant recipients. Genital candidiasis can be associated with HIV infection. Vulvo-vaginal candidiasis is often associated with pregnancy, diabetes mellitus, and antibiotic therapy.\n\n【5】 ## Medical Therapy\nAntifungal drugs which are taken orally, applied directly to the affected area, or used vaginally are the drugs of choice for vaginal yeast infections. Although these drugs usually work to cure the infection (80%-90% success rate), infections that do not respond to treatment are becoming more common, especially in HIV-infected women receiving long-term antifungal therapy.

Higher doses of aspirin may also increase bleeding events.\n\n【2】 ### Clinical Trial Data\nCAPRIE study (Clopidogrel versus Aspirin in Patients at Risk of Ischemic Events)\nAlthough, whether clopidogrel therapy is superior to aspirin in aspirin resistant patients is currently unknown, CAPRIE study investigators reported significant superiority of clopidogrel monotherapy over aspirin monotherapy. This beneficial effect was more frequently observed in high risk patients.\nIn fact, aspirin resistance is more frequent finding in high risk patients, such as diabetics and patients with diffuse atherosclerotic disease or acute coronary syndromes.

In contrast, high-risk patients should receive triple antiplatelet therapy.\nA low to medium risk patients study suggests that aspirin and clopidogrel may be insufficient in aspirin non responsive patients and resulted in quite similar results of ISAR-REACT.\nBoth study results indicate that there is a gap between applied medication and requirements for optimal antiplatelet treatment.\nMost interventional cardiologists give aspirin, clopidogrel, and heparin alone before PCI, however, up to 25% of these patients are aspirin non responsive.\n- RESISTOR trial (Research Evaluation to Study Individuals who Show Thromboxane Or P2Y12 Receptor Resistance)", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

It can be done by partial melting of a solid, for example in zone refining of silicon or metals, or by partial crystallization of a liquid, for example \"freeze distillation\", also called \"normal freezing\" or \"progressive freezing\".  Partial crystallization can also be achieved by adding a diluent solvent to the mixture, and cooling and concentrating the mixture by evaporating the solvent, a process called \"solution crystallization\".  Fractional freezing is generally used to produce ultra-pure solids, or to concentrate heat-sensitive liquids.\n\n【2】 #Freeze distillation\nFreeze distillation is a term for a process of enriching a solution by partially freezing it and removing frozen material that is poorer in the dissolved material than is the liquid portion left behind.  Such enrichment parallels enrichment by true distillation, where the evaporated and recondensed portion is richer than the liquid portion left behind.\n\n【3】 Without resorting to mathematics, the following can be said:\n- Freezing in this scenario would begin at a temperature significantly below 0 °C.\n- The first material to freeze would not be water, but a dilute solution of alcohol in water.\n- The liquid left behind would be richer in alcohol, and as a consequence, further freezing would take place at progressively lower temperatures, and the frozen material, while always poorer in alcohol than the (increasingly rich) liquid, would become progressively richer in alcohol.\n- Further stages of removing frozen material and waiting for more freezing will come to nought once the liquid uniformly cools to the temperature of whatever is cooling it.\n- If progressively colder temperatures are available, the frozen material will contain progressively larger concentrations of alcohol, and - the fraction of the original alcohol removed with the solid material will increase.\n\n【4】 In practice, while not able to produce an alcohol concentration comparable to distillation, this technique can achieve some concentration with far less effort than any practical distillation apparatus would require.\nToday, freeze distillation of alcoholic beverages is illegal in many countries because a number of by-products of fermentation (fusel alcohols), which are mostly removed by heat distillation, tend to accumulate to an unhealthy level in freeze-distilled beverages.\nThe best-known freeze-distilled beverages are applejack and ice beer. Ice wine is the result of a similar process, but in this case, the freezing happens before the fermentation, and thus it is sugar, not alcohol, that gets concentrated.  For an in depth discussion of the physics and chemistry, see Eutectic point.\n\n【5】 #Purification of solids\nWhen a pure solid is desired, two possible situations can occur.  If the contaminant is soluble in the desired solid, a multiple stage fractional freezing is required, analogous to multistage distillation.  If, however, a eutectic system forms (analogous to an azeotrope in distillation), a very pure solid can be recovered, as long as the liquid is not at its eutectic composition (in which case a mixed solid forms, which can be hard to separate) or above its eutectic composition (in which case the undesired solid forms).\n\n【6】 #Concentration of liquids\nWhen the requirement is to concentrate a liquid phase, fractional freezing can be useful due to its simplicity, for example when it is used to increase the alcohol concentration in fermented alcoholic beverages, a process sometimes called freeze distillation.  Examples are applejack, made from hard cider, and ice beer.  Freeze distillation of alcoholic beverages is illegal in many countries, as it concentrates poisonous compounds, for example fusel alcohols, in the original fermented beverage to unhealthy levels.\nFractional freezing is also used in the production of fruit juice concentrates and other heat-sensitive liquids, as it does not involve heating the liquid (as happens during evaporation).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Follow relevant national guidance on communication, providing information (including in different formats and languages) and shared decision making, for example, NICE's guideline on shared decision making.\nFor people with myeloma or other types of haematological cancer, discuss treatment strategies with a specialist team (such as, haematology and/or subspecialised myeloma teams) before giving immunomodulatory SACT.\nIf a person who is going to have (or has started) SACT has tested positive for COVID-19:\nif possible, delay the start of SACT (or pause the treatment if already underway) until any significant COVID-19 symptoms have resolved if delayed or paused, reach a shared decision with the person about when to start or resume SACT (discussions should include the factors described in recommendation 3.2, and take into account any local guidance on testing for SARS-CoV-2)\nensure the risk to other patients and healthcare staff is minimised when the person attends hospital for SACT, in line with local policies.\n\n【6】 #Modifications to usual service\n\n【7】 #Treatment breaks\nNHS England are developing a revised treatment break policy. These recommendations will be updated when this is published.\nIt is proposed that the current treatment break policy, which applies to both Cancer Drugs Fund (CDF) and non-CDF treatments, will not be applied during the COVID‑19 outbreak.\nWhere a treatment break is needed, clinicians should complete the approval form to restart treatment, indicating that the patient had a break because of COVID‑19. The request will be approved even if their disease has progressed, providing the clinician indicates there is a reasonable chance that disease control can be regained on restarting treatment. It is expected that the response to treatment will be reviewed 2 or 3 cycles after restarting.

{"seq_id": "2fc96851-8426-4f11-b102-0382444eafa5", "title": null, "text": "【0】 Psychometrics\nPsychometrics is the field of study concerned with the theory and technique of educational and psychological measurement, which includes the measurement of knowledge, abilities, attitudes, and personality traits.  The field is primarily concerned with the study of differences between individuals and between groups of individuals.  It involves two major research tasks, namely: (i) the construction of instruments and procedures for measurement; and (ii) the development and refinement of theoretical approaches to measurement.\n\n【1】 #Origins and background\nMuch of the early theoretical and applied work in psychometrics was undertaken in an attempt to measure intelligence.  Francis Galton is often referred to as the father of psychometrics, having devised and used mental tests. However, the origin of psychometrics also has connections to the related field of psychophysics.  Charles Spearman, a pioneer in psychometrics who developed approaches to the measurement of intelligence, studied under Wilhelm Wundt and was trained in psychophysics.  The psychometrician L. L. Thurstone later developed and applied a theoretical approach to the measurement referred to as the law of comparative judgment,  an approach which has close connections to the psychophysical theory developed by Ernst Heinrich Weber and Gustav Fechner.  In addition, Spearman and Thurstone both made important contributions to the theory and application of factor analysis, a statistical method that has been developed and used extensively in psychometrics.\nMore recently, psychometric theory has been applied in the measurement of personality, attitudes and beliefs, academic achievement, and in health-related fields.  Measurement of these unobservable phenomena is difficult, and much of the research and accumulated art in this discipline has been developed in an attempt to properly define and quantify such phenomena.  Critics, including practitioners in the physical sciences and social activists, have argued that such definition and quantification is impossibly difficult, and that such measurements are often misused.  Proponents of psychometric techniques can reply, though, that their critics often misuse data by not applying psychometric criteria, and also that various quantitative phenomena in the physical sciences, such as heat and forces, cannot be observed directly but must be inferred from their manifestations.\nFigures who made significant contributions to psychometrics include Karl Pearson, L. L. Thurstone, Georg Rasch, Johnson O'Connor, Frederick M. Lord and Arthur Jensen.\n\n【2】 #Definition of measurement in the social sciences\nThe definition of measurement in the social sciences has a long history.  A currently widespread definition, proposed by Stanley Smith Stevens , is that measurement is \"the assignment of numerals to objects or events according to some rule\".  This definition was introduced in the paper in which Stevens proposed four levels of measurement.  Although widely adopted, this definition differs in important respects from the more classical definition of measurement adopted throughout the physical sciences, which is that measurement is the numerical estimation and expression of the magnitude of one quantity relative to another (Michell, 1997).  Indeed, Stevens' definition of measurement was put forward in response to the British Ferguson Committee, whose chair, A. Ferguson, was a physicist.  The committee was appointed in 1932 by the British Association for the Advancement of Science to investigate the possibility of quantitatively estimating sensory events.  Although its chair and other members were physicists, the committee also comprised several psychologists.  The committee's report highlighted the importance of the definition of measurement.  While Stevens' response was to propose a new definition, which has had considerable influence in the field, this was by no means the only response to the report.  Another, notably different, response was to accept the classical definition, as reflected in the following statement:\n\n【3】 #Instruments and procedures\nThe first psychometric instruments were designed to measure the concept of intelligence.  The best known historical approach involves the Stanford-Binet IQ test, developed originally by the French Psychologist Alfred Binet.  Contrary to a fairly widespread misconception, there is no compelling evidence that it is possible to measure innate intelligence through such instruments, in the sense of an innate learning capacity unaffected by experience, nor was this the original intention when they were developed.  Nevertheless, IQ tests are useful tools for various purposes.  An alternative conception of intelligence is that cognitive capacities within individuals are a manifestation of a general component, or general intelligence factor, as well as cognitive capacity specific to a given domain.\nPsychometrics is applied widely in educational assessment to measure abilities in domains such as reading, writing, and mathematics.  The main approaches in applying tests in these domains have been Classical Test Theory and the more modern Item Response Theory and Rasch measurement models.\nAnother major focus in psychometrics have been on personality testing.  There have been a range of theoretical approaches to conceptualising and measuring personality.  Some of the better known instruments include the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, the Five-factor Model (or \"Big 5\") and the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator.  Attitudes have also been studied extensively in psychometrics.  A common approach to the measurement of attitudes is the use of the Likert scale.  An alternative approach involves the application of unfolding measurement models, the most general being the Hyperbolic Cosine Model .\n\n【4】 #Theoretical approaches\nPsychometric theory involves several distinct areas of study.  First, psychometricians have developed a large body of theory used in the development of mental tests and analysis of data collected from these tests.  This work can be roughly divided into classical test theory (CTT) and the more recent item response theory .  An approach which is similar to IRT but also quite distinctive, in terms of its origins and features, is represented by the Rasch model for measurement.  The development of the Rasch model, and the broader class of models to which it belongs, was explicitly founded on requirements of measurement in the physical sciences (Rasch, 1960).\nSecond, psychometricians have developed methods for working with large matrices of correlations and covariances.  Techniques in this general tradition include factor analysis (finding important underlying dimensions in the data), multidimensional scaling (finding a simple representation for high-dimensional data) and data clustering (finding objects which are like each other).  In these multivariate descriptive methods, users try to simplify large amounts of data.  More recently, structural equation modeling and path analysis represent more sophisticated approaches to solving this problem of large covariance matrices. These methods allow statistically sophisticated models to be fitted to data and tested to determine if they are adequate fits.\nOne of the main deficiencies in various factor analysis is a lack of cutting points. A usual procedure is to stop factoring when eigenvalues drop below one because the original sphere shrinks. The lack of the cutting points concerns other multivariate methods, too.  At the bottom, psychometric spaces are Hilbertian but they are dealt with as if Cartesian.  Therefore, the problem is more of interpretations than utilizing a method.\n\n【5】 ## Key concepts\nThe key traditional concepts in classical test theory are reliability and validity. A reliable measure is measuring something consistently, while a valid measure is measuring what it is supposed to measure. A reliable measure may be consistent without necessarily being valid, e.g. a measurement instrument like a broken ruler may always under-measure a quantity by the same amount each time (consistently), but the resulting quantity is still wrong, that is, invalid.  For another analogy, a reliable rifle will have a tight cluster of bullets in the target, while a valid one will center its cluster around the center of the target, whether or not the cluster is a tight one.\nBoth reliability and validity may be assessed mathematically. Internal consistency may be assessed by correlating performance on two halves of a test (split-half reliability); the value of the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient is adjusted with the Spearman-Brown prediction formula to correspond to the correlation between two full-length tests.  Other approaches include the intra-class correlation (the ratio of variance of measurements of a given target to the variance of all targets).  A commonly used measure is Cronbach's α, which is equivalent to the mean of all possible split-half coefficients. Stability over repeated measures is assessed with the Pearson coefficient, as is the equivalence of different versions of the same measure (different forms of an intelligence test, for example). Other measures are also used.\nValidity may be assessed by correlating measures with a criterion measure known to be valid. When the criterion measure is collected at the same time as the measure being validated the goal is to establish concurrent validity; when the criterion is collected later the goal is to establish predictive validity. A measure has construct validity if it is related to other variables as required by theory. Content validity is simply a demonstration that the items of a test are drawn from the domain being measured.  In a personnel selection example, test content is based on a defined statement or set of statements of knowledge, skill, ability, or other characteristics obtained from a job analysis.\nPredictive or concurrent validity cannot exceed the square of the correlation between two versions of the same measure.\nItem response theory models the relationship between latent traits and responses to test items. Among other advantages, IRT provides a basis for obtaining an estimate of the location of a test-taker on a given latent trait as well as the standard error of measurement of that location. For example, a university student's knowledge of history can be deduced from his or her score on a university test and then be compared reliably with a high school student's knowledge deduced from a less difficult test. Scores derived by classical test theory do not have this characteristic, and assessment of actual ability (rather than ability relative to other test-takers) must be assessed by comparing scores to those of a norm group randomly selected from the population. In fact, all measures derived from classical test theory are dependent on the sample tested, while, in principle, those derived from item response theory are not.\n\n【6】 #Standards of quality\nThe considerations of validity and reliability typically are viewed as essential elements for determining the quality of any test.  However, professional and practitioner associations frequently have placed these concerns within broader contexts when developing standards and making overall judgments about the quality of any test as a whole within a given context. A consideration of concern in many applied research settings is whether or not the metric of a given psychological inventory is meaningful or arbitrary.\n\n【7】 ## Testing standards\nIn this field, the Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing  place standards about validity and reliability, along with errors of measurement and related considerations under the general topic of test construction, evaluation and documentation.  The second major topic covers standards related to fairness in testing, including fairness in testing and test use, the rights and responsibilities of test takers, testing individuals of diverse linguistic backgrounds, and testing individuals with disabilities.  The third and final major topic covers standards related to testing applications, including the responsibilities of test users, psychological testing and assessment, educational testing and assessment, testing in employment and credentialing, plus testing in program evaluation and public policy.\n\n【8】 ## Evaluation standards\n\n【9】 Each publication presents and elaborates a set of standards for use in a variety of educational settings. The standards provide guidelines for designing, implementing, assessing and improving the identified form of evaluation. Each of the standards has been placed in one of four fundamental categories to promote educational evaluations that are proper, useful, feasible, and accurate.  In these sets of standards, validity and reliability considerations are covered under the accuracy topic.  For example, the student accuracy standards help ensure that student evaluations will provide sound, accurate, and credible information about student learning and performance.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Unintended pregnancies increase the risk for poor maternal and infant outcomes  and in 2010, resulted in U.S. government health care expenditures of $21 billion . Approximately half of unintended pregnancies are among women who were not using contraception at the time they became pregnant; the other half are among women who became pregnant despite reported use of contraception . Strategies to prevent unintended pregnancy include assisting women at risk for unintended pregnancy and their partners with choosing appropriate contraceptive methods and helping them use methods correctly and consistently to prevent pregnancy.\nIn 2013, CDC published the first U.S. Selected Practice Recommendations for Contraceptive Use (U.S. SPR), adapted from global guidance developed by the World Health Organization (WHO SPR), which provided evidence-based guidance on how to use contraceptive methods safely and effectively once they are deemed to be medically appropriate.\n\n【2】 #U.S. SPR is a companion document to U.S. Medical Eligibility\nCriteria for Contraceptive Use (U.S. MEC) .\nThis document updates the 2013 U.S. SPR  with new evidence and input from experts. Major updates include 1 revised recommendations for starting regular contraception after the use of emergency contraceptive pills and 2 new recommendations for the use of medications to ease insertion of intrauterine devices (IUDs). Recommendations are provided for health care providers on the safe and effective use of contraceptive methods and address provision of contraceptive methods and management of side effects and other problems with contraceptive method use, within the framework of removing unnecessary medical barriers to accessing and using contraception. These recommendations are meant to serve as a source of clinical guidance for health care providers; health care providers should always consider the individual clinical circumstances of each person seeking family planning services. This report is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice for individual patients, who should seek advice from their health care providers when considering family planning options.\n\n【3】 #Summary of Changes from the 2013 U.S. SPR Updated Recommendations\nRecommendations have been updated regarding when to start regular contraception after ulipristal acetate (UPA) emergency contraceptive pills:\n- Advise the woman to start or resume hormonal contraception no sooner than 5 days after use of UPA, and provide or prescribe the regular contraceptive method as needed. For methods requiring a visit to a health care provider, such as depo-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA), implants, and IUDs, starting the method at the time of UPA use may be considered; the risk that the regular contraceptive method might decrease the effectiveness of UPA must be weighed against the risk of not starting a regular hormonal contraceptive method. - The woman needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier contraception for the next 7 days after starting or resuming regular contraception or until her next menses, whichever comes first. - Any nonhormonal contraceptive method can be started immediately after the use of UPA. - Advise the woman to have a pregnancy test if she does not have a withdrawal bleed within 3 weeks.\n\n【4】 #New Recommendations\nNew recommendations have been made for medications to ease IUD insertion:\n- Misoprostol is not recommended for routine use before IUD insertion. Misoprostol might be helpful in select circumstances (e.g. in women with a recent failed insertion). - Paracervical block with lidocaine might reduce patient pain during IUD insertion.\n\n【5】 #Methods\nSince publication of the 2013 U.S. SPR, CDC has monitored the literature for new evidence relevant to the recommendations through the WHO/CDC continuous identification of research evidence (CIRE) system . This system identifies new evidence as it is published and allows WHO and CDC to update systematic reviews and facilitate updates to recommendations as new evidence warrants. Automated searches are run in PubMed weekly, and the results are reviewed. Abstracts that meet specific criteria are added to the web-based CIRE system, which facilitates coordination and peer review of systematic reviews for both WHO and CDC. In 2014, CDC reviewed all of the existing recommendations in the 2013 U.S. SPR for new evidence identified by CIRE that had the potential to lead to a changed recommendation. During August 27-28, 2014, CDC held a meeting in Atlanta, Georgia, of 11 family planning experts and representatives from partner organizations to solicit their input on the scope of and process for updating both the 2010 U.S. MEC and the 2013 U.S. SPR. The participants were experts in family planning and represented different provider types and organizations that represent health care providers. A list of participants is provided at the end of this report. The meeting related to topics to be addressed in the update of U.S. SPR based on new scientific evidence published since 2013 (identified though the CIRE system), topics addressed at a 2014 WHO meeting to update global guidance, and suggestions CDC received from providers for the addition of recommendations not included in the 2013 U.S. SPR (e.g. from provider feedback through e-mail, public inquiry, and questions received at conferences). CDC identified one topic to consider adding to the guidance: the use of medications to ease IUD insertion (evidence question: \"Among women of reproductive age, does use of medications before IUD insertion improve the safety or effectiveness of the procedure  or affect patient outcomes  compared with nonuse of these medications?\"). CDC also identified one topic for which new evidence warranted a review of an existing recommendation: initiation of regular contraception after emergency contraceptive pills (evidence question: \"Does ulipristal acetate for emergency contraception interact with regular use of hormonal contraception leading to decreased effectiveness of either contraceptive method?\"). CDC determined that all other recommendations in the 2013 U.S. SPR were up to date and consistent with the current body of evidence for that recommendation.\nIn preparation for a subsequent expert meeting August 2015, to review the scientific evidence\n\n【6】 #Maintaining Updated Guidance\nAs with any evidence-based guidance document, a key challenge is keeping the recommendations up to date as new scientific evidence becomes available. Working with WHO, CDC uses the CIRE system to ensure that WHO and CDC guidance is based on the best available evidence and that a mechanism is in place to update guidance when new evidence becomes available . CDC will continue to work with WHO to identify and assess all new relevant evidence and determine whether changes in the recommendations are warranted. In most cases, U.S. SPR will follow any updates in the WHO guidance, which typically occurs every 5 years (or sooner if warranted by new data). In addition, CDC will review any interim WHO updates for their application in the United States. CDC also will identify and assess any new literature for the recommendations that are not included in the WHO guidance and will completely review U.S. SPR every 5 years. Updates to the guidance can be found on the U.S.\n\n【7】 #How To Use This Document\nThe recommendations in this report are intended to help health care providers address issues related to use of contraceptives, such as how to help a woman initiate use of a contraceptive method, which examinations and tests are needed before initiating use of a contraceptive method, what regular follow-up is needed, and how to address problems that often arise during use, including missed pills and side effects such as unscheduled bleeding. Each recommendation addresses what a woman or health care provider can do in specific situationsS. MEC are provided . The full U.S. MEC recommendations and the evidence supporting those recommendations have been updated in 2016  and are summarized .\nRecommendations in this document are provided for permanent methods of contraception, such as vasectomy and female sterilization, as well as for reversible methods of contraception, including the copper-containing intrauterine device (Cu-IUD); levonorgestrel-releasing IUDs (LNG-IUDs); the etonogestrel implant; progestin-only injectables; progestinonly pills (POPs); combined hormonal contraceptive methods that contain both estrogen and a progestin, including combined oral contraceptives (COCs), a transdermal contraceptive patch, and a vaginal contraceptive ring; and the standard days method (SDM). Recommendations also are provided for emergency use of the Cu-IUD and emergency contraceptive pills (ECPs).\nFor each contraceptive method, recommendations are provided on the timing for initiation of the method and indications for when and for how long additional contraception, or a back-up method, is needed. Many of these recommendations include guidance that a woman can start a contraceptive method at any time during her menstrual cycle if it is reasonably certain that she is not pregnant. Guidance for health care providers on how to be reasonably certain that a woman is not pregnant also is provided.\nFor each contraceptive method, recommendations include the examinations and tests needed before initiation of the method. These recommendations apply to persons who are presumed to be healthy. Those with known medical problems or other special conditions might need additional examinations or tests before being determined to be appropriate candidates for a particular method of contraception. U.S. MEC might be useful in such circumstances . Most women need no or very few examinations or tests before initiating a contraceptive method although they might be needed to address other noncontraceptive health needs . Any additional screening needed for preventive health care can be performed at the time of contraception initiation, and initiation should not be delayed for test results. The following classification system was developed by WHO and adopted by CDC to categorize the applicability of the various examinations or tests before initiation of contraceptive methods : Class A: These tests and examinations are essential and mandatory in all circumstances for safe and effective use of the contraceptive method.\nClass B: These tests and examinations contribute substantially to safe and effective use, although implementation can be considered within the public health context, service context, or both. The risk for not performing an examination or test should be balanced against the benefits of making the contraceptive method available. Class C: These tests and examinations do not contribute substantially to safe and effective use of the contraceptive method.\nSummary charts and clinical algorithms that summarize the guidance for the various contraceptive methods have been developed for many of the recommendations, including when to start using specific contraceptive methods , examinations and tests needed before initiating the various contraceptive methods , routine follow-up after initiating contraception , management of bleeding irregularities , and management of IUDs when users are found to have pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) . These summaries might be helpful to health care providers when managing family planning patients. Additional tools are available on the U.S. SPR website .\n\n【8】 #Contraceptive Method Choice\nMany elements need to be considered individually by a woman, man, or couple when choosing the most appropriate contraceptive method. Some of these elements include safety, effectiveness, availability (including accessibility and affordability), and acceptability. Although most contraceptive methods are safe for use by most women, U.S. MEC provides recommendations on the safety of specific contraceptive methods for women with certain characteristics and medical conditions ; a U.S. MEC summary  and the categories of medical eligibility criteria for contraceptive use  are provided.\nVoluntary informed choice of contraceptive methods is an essential guiding principle, and contraceptive counseling, where applicable, might be an important contributor to the successful use of contraceptive methods.\nContraceptive method effectiveness is critically important in minimizing the risk for unintended pregnancy, particularly among women for whom an unintended pregnancy would pose additional health risks. The effectiveness of contraceptive methods depends both on the inherent effectiveness of the method itself and on how consistently and correctly it is used . Both consistent and correct use can vary greatly with characteristics such as age, income, desire to prevent or delay pregnancy, and culture. Methods that depend on consistent and correct use by clients have a wide range of effectiveness between typical use (actual use, including incorrect or inconsistent use) and perfect use (correct and consistent use according to directions) . IUDs and implants are considered longacting, reversible contraception (LARC); these methods are highly effective because they do not depend on regular compliance from the user. LARC methods are appropriate for most women, including adolescents and nulliparous women. All women should be counseled about the full range and effectiveness of contraceptive options for which they are medically eligible so that they can identify the optimal method.\nIn choosing a method of contraception, dual protection from the simultaneous risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) also should be considered. Although hormonal contraceptives and IUDs are highly effective at preventing pregnancy, they do not protect against STDs, including HIV. Consistent and correct use of the male latex condom reduces the risk for HIV infection and other STDs, including chlamydial infection, gonococcal infection, and trichomoniasis . Although evidence is limited, use of female condoms can provide protection from acquisition and transmission of STDs . All patients, regardless of contraceptive choice, should be counseled about the use of condoms and the risk for STDs, including HIV infection\nWomen, men, and couples have increasing numbers of safe and effective choices for contraceptive methods, including LARC methods such as IUDs and implants, to reduce the risk for unintended pregnancy. However, with these expanded options comes the need for evidence-based guidance to help health care providers offer quality family planning care to their patients, including assistance in choosing the most appropriate contraceptive method for individual circumstances and using that method correctly, consistently, and continuously to maximize effectiveness. Removing unnecessary barriers can help patients access and successfully use contraceptive methods. Several medical barriers to initiating and continuing contraceptive methods might exist, such as unnecessary screening examinations and tests before starting the method (e.g. a pelvic examination before initiation of COCs), inability to receive the contraceptive on the same day as the visit (e.g. waiting for test results that might not be needed or waiting until the woman's next menstrual cycle to start use), and difficulty obtaining continued contraceptive supplies (e.g. restrictions on number of pill packs dispensed at one time). Removing unnecessary steps, such as providing prophylactic antibiotics at the time of IUD insertion or requiring unnecessary follow-up procedures, also can help patients access and successfully use contraception.\n\n【9】 #How To Be Reasonably Certain that a Woman Is Not Pregnant\nSeveral criteria for assessing pregnancy risk are listed in the recommendation that follows. These criteria are highly accurate (i.e. a negative predictive value of 99%-100%) in ruling out pregnancy among women who are not pregnant . Therefore, CDC recommends that health care providers use these criteria to assess pregnancy status in a woman who is about to start using contraceptives . If a woman meets one of these criteria (and therefore the health care provider can be reasonably certain that she is not pregnant), a urine pregnancy BOX 1. Categories of medical eligibility criteria for contraceptive use - U.S. MEC 1 = A condition for which there is no restriction for the use of the contraceptive method. - U.S. MEC 2 = A condition for which the advantages of using the method generally outweigh the theoretical or proven risks. - U.S. MEC 3 = A condition for which the theoretical or proven risks usually outweigh the advantages of using the method. - U.S. MEC 4 = A condition that represents an unacceptable health risk if the contraceptive method is used. test might be considered in addition to these criteria (based on clinical judgment), bearing in mind the limitations of the accuracy of pregnancy testing. If a woman does not meet any of these criteria, then the health care provider cannot be reasonably certain that she is not pregnant, even with a negative pregnancy test. Routine pregnancy testing for every woman is not necessary. On the basis of clinical judgment, health care providers might consider the addition of a urine pregnancy test; however, they should be aware of the limitations, including accuracy of the test relative to the time of last sexual intercourse, recent delivery, or spontaneous or induced abortion. Routine pregnancy testing for every woman is not necessary. If a woman has had recent (i.e. within the last 5 days) unprotected sexual intercourse, consider offering emergency contraception (either a Cu-IUD or ECPs) if pregnancy is not desired.\nComments and Evidence Summary. The criteria for determining whether a woman is pregnant depend on the assurance that she has not ovulated within a certain amount of time after her last menses, spontaneous or induced abortion, or delivery. Among menstruating women, the timing of ovulation can vary widely. During an average 28-day cycle, ovulation generally occurs during days 9-20 . In addition, the likelihood of ovulation is low from days 1-7 of the menstrual cycle . After a spontaneous or an induced abortion, ovulation can occur within 2-3 weeks and has been found to occur as early as 8-13 days after the end of the pregnancy. Therefore, the likelihood of ovulation is low ≤7 days after\n\n【10】 #Vasectomy and hysteroscopic sterilization:\nAfter procedure, little or nothing to do or remember.\nUse another method for rst 3 months.\nInjectable: Get repeat injections on time.\nPills: Take a pill each day.\n\n【11】 #Most E ective\nLess than 1 pregnancy 6-12 pregnancies per 100 women in a year per 100 women in a year 18 or more pregnancies per 100 women in a year\n\n【12】 #CONDOMS SHOULD ALWAYS BE USED TO REDUCE THE RISK OF SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS.\nOther Methods of Contraception Lactational Amenorrhea Method: LAM is a highly e ective, temporary method of contraception. Emergency Contraception: Emergency contraceptive pills or a copper IUD after unprotected intercourse substantially reduces risk of pregnancy. an abortion . A systematic review reported that the mean day of first ovulation among postpartum nonlactating women occurred 45-94 days after delivery . In one study, the earliest ovulation was reported at 25 days after delivery. Among women who are within 6 months postpartum, are fully or nearly fully breastfeeding (exclusively breastfeeding or the vast majority  of feeds are breastfeeds), and are amenorrheic, the risk for pregnancy is <2% .\nAlthough pregnancy tests often are performed before initiating contraception, the accuracy of qualitative urine pregnancy tests varies depending on the timing of the test relative to missed menses, recent sexual intercourse, or recent pregnancy. The sensitivity of a pregnancy test is defined as the concentration of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) at which 95% of tests are positive. Most qualitative pregnancy tests approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) report a sensitivity of 20-25 mIU/mL in urine . However, pregnancy detection rates can vary widely because of differences in test sensitivity and the timing of testing relative to missed menses .\nFor contraceptive methods other than IUDs, the benefits of starting to use a contraceptive method likely exceed any risk, even in situations in which the health care provider is uncertain whether the woman is pregnant. Therefore, the health care provider can consider having patients start using contraceptive methods other than IUDs at any time, with a follow-up pregnancy test in 2-4 weeks. The risks of not starting to use contraception should be weighed against the risks of initiating contraception use in a woman who might be already pregnant. Most studies have shown no increased risk for adverse outcomes, including congenital anomalies or neonatal or infant death, among infants exposed in utero to COCs . Studies also have shown no increased risk for neonatal or infant death or developmental abnormalities among infants exposed in utero to DMPA .\nIn contrast, for women who want to begin using an IUD (Cu-IUD or LNG-IUD), in situations in which the health care provider is uncertain whether the woman is pregnant, the woman should be provided with another contraceptive method to use until the health care provider is reasonably certain that she is not pregnant and can insert the IUD. Pregnancies among women with IUDs are at higher risk for complications such as spontaneous abortion, septic abortion, preterm delivery, and chorioamnionitis .\nA systematic review identified four analyses of data from three diagnostic accuracy studies that evaluated the performance of the listed criteria  through use of a pregnancy checklist compared with a urine pregnancy test conducted concurrently . The performance of the checklist to diagnose or exclude pregnancy varied, with sensitivity of 55%-100% and specificity of 39%-89%. The negative predictive value was consistent across studies at 99%-100%; the pregnancy checklist correctly ruled out women who were not pregnant. One of the studies assessed the added usefulness of signs and symptoms of pregnancy and found that these criteria did not substantially improve the performance of the pregnancy checklist, although the number of women with signs and symptoms was small  (Level of evidence: Diagnostic accuracy studies, fair, direct).\n\n【13】 #Intrauterine Contraception\nFour IUDs are available in the United States, the coppercontaining IUD and three levonorgestrel-releasing IUDs (containing a total of either 13.5 mg or 52 mg levonorgestrel). Fewer than 1 woman out of 100 becomes pregnant in the first year of using IUDs (with typical use) . IUDs are long-acting, are reversible, and can be used by women of all ages, including adolescents, and by parous and nulliparous women. IUDs do not protect against STDs; consistent and correct use of male latex condoms reduces the risk for STDs, including HIV.\n\n【14】 #BOX 2. How to be reasonably certain that a woman is not pregnant\nA health care provider can be reasonably certain that a woman is not pregnant if she has no symptoms or signs of pregnancy and meets any one of the following criteria: - is ≤7 days after the start of normal menses - has not had sexual intercourse since the start of last normal menses. - has been correctly and consistently using a reliable method of contraception - is ≤7 days after spontaneous or induced abortion - is within 4 weeks postpartum - is fully or nearly fully breastfeeding (exclusively breastfeeding or the vast majority  of feeds are breastfeeds), amenorrheic, and <6 months postpartum\n\n【15】 #Initiation of Cu-IUDs Timing\n- The Cu-IUD can be inserted at any time if it is reasonably certain that the woman is not pregnant . - The Cu-IUD also can be inserted within 5 days of the first act of unprotected sexual intercourse as an emergency contraceptive. If the day of ovulation can be estimated, the Cu-IUD also can be inserted >5 days after sexual intercourse as long as insertion does not occur >5 days after ovulation.\n\n【16】 #Need for Back-Up Contraception\n- No additional contraceptive protection is needed after Cu-IUD insertion.\n\n【17】 #Special Considerations\nAmenorrhea (Not Postpartum)\n- Timing: The Cu-IUD can be inserted at any time if it is reasonably certain that the woman is not pregnant . - Need for back-up contraception: No additional contraceptive protection is needed.\n\n【18】 #Postpartum (Including After Cesarean Delivery)\n- Timing: The Cu-IUD can be inserted at any time postpartum, including immediately postpartum (U.S. MEC 1 or 2) , if it is reasonably certain that the woman is not pregnant . The Cu-IUD should not be inserted in a woman with postpartum sepsis (e.g. chorioamnionitis or endometritis) (U.S. MEC 4). - Need for back-up contraception: No additional contraceptive protection is needed.\n\n【19】 #Postabortion (Spontaneous or Induced)\n- Timing: The Cu-IUD can be inserted within the first 7 days, including immediately postabortion (U.S. MEC 1 for first-trimester abortion and U.S. MEC 2 for secondtrimester abortion). The Cu-IUD should not be inserted immediately after a septic abortion (U.S. MEC 4). - Need for back-up contraception: No additional contraceptive protection is needed.\n\n【20】 #Switching from Another Contraceptive Method\n- Timing: The Cu-IUD can be inserted immediately if it is reasonably certain that the woman is not pregnant . Waiting for her next menstrual cycle is unnecessary. - Need for back-up contraception: No additional contraceptive protection is needed.\nComments and Evidence Summary. In situations in which the health care provider is not reasonably certain that the woman is not pregnant, the woman should be provided with another contraceptive method to use until the health care provider can be reasonably certain that she is not pregnant and can insert the Cu-IUD.\nA systematic review identified eight studies that suggested that timing of Cu-IUD insertion in relation to the menstrual cycle in non-postpartum women had little effect on longterm outcomes (rates of continuation, removal, expulsion, or pregnancy) or on short-term outcomes (pain at insertion, bleeding at insertion, or immediate expulsion)  (Level of evidence: II-2, fair, direct).\n\n【21】 #Timing of LNG-IUD Insertion\n- The LNG-IUD can be inserted at any time if it is reasonably certain that the woman is not pregnant .\n\n【22】 #Need for Back-Up Contraception\n- If the LNG-IUD is inserted within the first 7 days since menstrual bleeding started, no additional contraceptive protection is needed. - If the LNG-IUD is inserted >7 days since menstrual bleeding started, the woman needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use additional contraceptive protection for the next 7 days.\n\n【23】 #Special Considerations\nAmenorrhea (Not Postpartum)\n- Timing: The LNG-IUD can be inserted at any time if it is reasonably certain that the woman is not pregnant . - Need for back-up contraception: The woman needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use additional contraceptive protection for the next 7 days.\n\n【24】 #Switching from Another Contraceptive Method\n- Timing: The LNG-IUD can be inserted immediately if it is reasonably certain that the woman is not pregnant . Waiting for her next menstrual cycle is unnecessary. - Need for back-up contraception: If it has been >7 days since menstrual bleeding began, the woman needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use additional contraceptive protection for the next 7 days. - Switching from a Cu-IUD: If the woman has had sexual intercourse since the start of her current menstrual cycle and it has been >5 days since menstrual bleeding started, theoretically, residual sperm might be in the genital tract, which could lead to fertilization if ovulation occurs. A health care provider may consider providing any type of ECPs at the time of LNG-IUD insertion. Comments and Evidence Summary. In situations in which the health care provider is uncertain whether the woman might be pregnant, the woman should be provided with another contraceptive method to use until the health care provider can be reasonably certain that she is not pregnant and can insert the LNG-IUD. If a woman needs to use additional contraceptive protection when switching to an LNG-IUD from another contraceptive method, consider continuing her previous method for 7 days after LNG-IUD insertion. No direct evidence was found regarding the effects of inserting LNG-IUDs on different days of the cycle on short-or longterm outcomes .\n\n【25】 #Examinations and Tests Needed Before Initiation of a Cu-IUD or an LNG-IUD\nAmong healthy women, few examinations or tests are needed before initiation of an IUD . Bimanual examination and cervical inspection are necessary before IUD insertion. A baseline weight and BMI measurement might be useful for monitoring IUD users over time. If a woman has not been screened for STDs according to STD screening guidelines, screening can be performed at the time of insertion. Women with known medical problems or other special conditions might need additional examinations or tests before being determined to be appropriate candidates for a particular method of contraception. U.S. MEC might be useful in such circumstances .\nComments and Evidence Summary. Weight (BMI): Obese women can use IUDs (U.S. MEC 1) ; therefore, screening for obesity is not necessary for the safe initiation of IUDs. However, measuring weight and calculating - Class A: essential and mandatory in all circumstances for safe and effective use of the contraceptive method. Class B: contributes substantially to safe and effective use, but implementation may be considered within the public health and/or service context; the risk of not performing an examination or test should be balanced against the benefits of making the contraceptive method available. Class C: does not contribute substantially to safe and effective use of the contraceptive method.  Weight (BMI) measurement is not needed to determine medical eligibility for any methods of contraception because all methods can be used (U.S. MEC 1) or generally can be used (U.S. MEC 2) among obese women . However, measuring weight and calculating BMI at baseline might be helpful for monitoring any changes and counseling women who might be concerned about weight change perceived to be associated with their contraceptive method.  Most women do not require additional STD screening at the time of IUD insertion.\nIf a woman with risk factors for STDs has not been screened for gonorrhea and chlamydia according to CDC's STD Treatment Guidelines (/ treatment), screening can be performed at the time of IUD insertion, and insertion should not be delayed. Women with current purulent cervicitis or chlamydial infection or gonococcal infection should not undergo IUD insertion (U.S. MEC 4).\n\n【26】 #BMI ,weight  / height\nat baseline might be helpful for monitoring any changes and counseling women who might be concerned about weight change perceived to be associated with their contraceptive method. Bimanual examination and cervical inspection: Bimanual examination and cervical inspection are necessary before IUD insertion to assess uterine size and position and to detect any cervical or uterine abnormalities that might indicate infection or otherwise prevent IUD insertion .\nSTDs: Women should be routinely screened for chlamydial infection and gonorrhea according to national screening guidelines. The CDC Sexually Transmitted Diseases Treatment Guidelines provide information on screening eligibility, timing, and frequency of screening and on screening for persons with risk factors  . If STD screening guidelines have been followed, most women do not need additional STD screening at the time of IUD insertion, and insertion should not be delayed. If a woman with risk factors for STDs has not been screened for gonorrhea and chlamydia according to CDC STD treatment guidelines, screening can be performed at the time of IUD insertion, and insertion should not be delayed. Women with current purulent cervicitis or chlamydial infection or gonococcal infection should not undergo IUD insertion (U.S. MEC 4). A systematic review identified two studies that demonstrated no differences in PID rates among women who screened positive for gonorrhea or chlamydia and underwent concurrent IUD insertion compared with women who screened positive and initiated other contraceptive methods . Indirect evidence demonstrates women who undergo same-day STD screening and IUD insertion have similar PID rates compared with women who have delayed IUD insertion. Women who undergo same-day STD screening and IUD insertion have low incidence rates of PID. Algorithms for predicting PID among women with risk factors for STDs have poor predictive value. Risk for PID among women with risk factors for STDs is low ,15. Although women with STDs at the time of IUD insertion have a higher risk for PID, the overall rate of PID among all IUD users is low .\nHemoglobin: Women with iron-deficiency anemia can use the LNG-IUD (U.S. MEC 1) ; therefore, screening for anemia is not necessary for safe initiation of the LNG-IUD. Women with iron-deficiency anemia generally can use Cu-IUDs (U.S. MEC 2) . Measurement of hemoglobin before initiation of Cu-IUDs is not necessary because of the minimal change in hemoglobin among women with and without anemia using Cu-IUDs. A systematic review identified four studies that provided direct evidence for changes in hemoglobin among women with anemia who received Cu-IUDs . Evidence from one randomized trial  and one prospective cohort study  showed no significant changes in hemoglobin among Cu-IUD users with anemia, whereas two prospective cohort studies .\nLipids: Screening for dyslipidemias is not necessary for the safe initiation of Cu-IUD or LNG-IUD because of the low prevalence of undiagnosed disease in women of reproductive age and the low likelihood of clinically significant changes with use of hormonal contraceptives. A systematic review did not identify any evidence regarding outcomes among women who were screened versus not screened with lipid measurement before initiation of hormonal contraceptives . During 2009-2012 among women aged 20-44 years in the United States, 7.6% had high cholesterol, defined as total serum cholesterol ≥240 mg/dL . During 1999-2008, the prevalence of undiagnosed hypercholesterolemia among women aged 20-44 years was approximately 2% . Studies have shown mixed results about the effects of hormonal methods on lipid levels among both healthy women and women with baseline lipid abnormalities, and the clinical significance of these changes is unclear .\nLiver enzymes: Women with liver disease can use the Cu-IUD (U.S. MEC 1) ; therefore, screening for liver disease is not necessary for the safe initiation of the Cu-IUD. Although women with certain liver diseases generally should not use the LNG-IUD (U.S. MEC 3) , screening for liver disease before initiation of the LNG-IUD is not necessary because of the low prevalence of these conditions and the high likelihood that women with liver disease already would have had the condition diagnosed. A systematic review did not identify any evidence regarding outcomes among women who were screened versus not screened with liver enzyme tests before initiation of hormonal contraceptive use . In 2012, among U.S. women, the percentage with liver disease (not further specified) was 1.3% . In 2013, the incidence of acute hepatitis A, B, or C was ≤1 per 100,000 U.S. population . During 2002-2011, the incidence of liver carcinoma among U.S. women was approximately 3.7 per 100,000 population . Because estrogen and progestins are metabolized in the liver, the use of hormonal contraceptives among women with liver disease might, theoretically, be a concern. The use of hormonal contraceptives, specifically COCs and POPs, does not affect disease progression or severity in women with hepatitis, cirrhosis, or benign focal nodular hyperplasia , although evidence is limited, and no evidence exists for the LNG-IUD.\nClinical breast examination: Women with breast disease can use the Cu-IUD (U.S. MEC 1) ; therefore, screening for breast disease is not necessary for the safe initiation of the Cu-IUD. Although women with current breast cancer should not use the LNG-IUD (U.S. MEC 4) , screening asymptomatic women with a clinical breast examination before inserting an IUD is not necessary because of the low prevalence of breast cancer among women of reproductive age. A systematic review did not identify any evidence regarding outcomes among women who were screened versus not screened with a breast examination before initiation of hormonal contraceptives . The incidence of breast cancer among women of reproductive age in the United States is low. In 2012, the incidence of breast cancer among women aged 20-49 years was approximately 70.7 per 100,000 women .\nCervical cytology: Although women with cervical cancer should not undergo IUD insertion (U.S. MEC 4) , screening asymptomatic women with cervical cytology before IUD insertion is not necessary because of the high rates of cervical screening, low incidence of cervical cancer in the United States, and high likelihood that a woman with cervical cancer already would have had the condition diagnosed. A systematic review did not identify any evidence regarding outcomes among women who were screened versus not screened with cervical cytology before initiation of IUDs . Cervical cancer is rare in the United States, with an incidence rate of 9.8 per 100,000 women during 2012 . The incidence and mortality rates from cervical cancer have declined dramatically in the United States, largely because of cervical cytology screening . Overall screening rates for cervical cancer in the United States are high; in 2013 among women aged 18-44 years, approximately 77% reported having cervical cytology screening within the last 3 years .\nHIV screening: Women with HIV infection can use (U.S. MEC 1) or generally can use (U.S. MEC 2) IUDs . Therefore, HIV screening is not necessary before IUD insertion. A systematic review did not identify any evidence regarding outcomes among women who were screened versus not screened for HIV infection before IUD insertion . Limited evidence suggests that IUDs are not associated with disease progression, increased infection, or other adverse health effects among women with HIV infection .\nOther screening: Women with hypertension, diabetes, or thrombogenic mutations can use (U.S. MEC 1) or generally can use (U.S. MEC 2) IUDs . Therefore, screening for these conditions is not necessary for the safe initiation of IUDs.\n\n【27】 #Provision of Medications to Ease\nIUD Insertion\n- Misoprostol is not recommended for routine use before IUD insertion. Misoprostol might be helpful in select circumstances (e.g. in women with a recent failed insertion). - Paracervical block with lidocaine might reduce patient pain during IUD insertion. Comments and Evidence Summary. Potential barriers to IUD use include anticipated pain with insertion and provider concerns about difficult insertion. Identifying effective approaches to ease IUD insertion might increase IUD initiation.\nEvidence for misoprostol from two systematic reviews, including a total of 10 randomized controlled trials, suggests that misoprostol does not improve provider ease of insertion, reduce the need for adjunctive insertion measures, or improve insertion success (Level of evidence: I, good to fair, direct) and might increase patient pain and side effects (Level of evidence: I, high quality) .\nLimited evidence for paracervical block with lidocaine from one systematic review suggests that it might reduce patient pain . In this review, two randomized controlled trials found significantly reduced pain at either tenaculum placement or IUD insertion among women receiving paracervical block with 1% lidocaine 3-5 minutes before IUD insertion .\n\n【28】 #Provision of Prophylactic Antibiotics at the Time of IUD Insertion\n- Prophylactic antibiotics are generally not recommended for Cu-IUD or LNG-IUD insertion. Comments and Evidence Summary. Theoretically, IUD insertion could induce bacterial spread and lead to complications such as PID or infective endocarditis. A metaanalysis was conducted of randomized controlled trials examining antibiotic prophylaxis versus placebo or no treatment for IUD insertion . Use of prophylaxis reduced the frequency of unscheduled return visits but did not significantly reduce the incidence of PID or premature IUD discontinuation. Although the risk for PID was higher within the first 20 days after insertion, the incidence of PID was low among all women who had IUDs inserted . In addition, the American Heart Association recommends that the use of prophylactic antibiotics solely to prevent infective endocarditis is not needed for genitourinary procedures . Studies have not demonstrated a conclusive link between genitourinary procedures and infective endocarditis or a preventive benefit of prophylactic antibiotics during such procedures .\n\n【29】 #Routine Follow-Up After IUD Insertion\nThese recommendations address when routine follow-up is needed for safe and effective continued use of contraception for healthy women, Specific populations who might benefit from more frequent follow-up visits include adolescents, persons with certain medical conditions or characteristics, and persons with multiple medical conditions.\n- Advise the woman to return at any time to discuss side effects or other problems, if she wants to change the method being used, and when it is time to remove or replace the contraceptive method. No routine follow-up visit is required. - At other routine visits, health care providers who see IUD users should do the following: -Assess the woman's satisfaction with her contraceptive method and whether she has any concerns about method use. -Assess any changes in health status, including medications, that would change the appropriateness of the IUD for safe and effective continued use on the basis of U.S. MEC (e.g. category 3 and 4 conditions and characteristics). -Consider performing an examination to check for the presence of the IUD strings. -Consider assessing weight changes and counseling women who are concerned about weight changes perceived to be associated with their contraceptive method. Comments and Evidence Summary. Evidence from a systematic review about the effect of a specific follow-up visit schedule on IUD continuation is very limited and of poor quality. The evidence did not suggest that greater frequency of visits or earlier timing of the first follow-up visit after insertion improves continuation of use  (Level of evidence: II-2, poor, direct). Evidence from four studies from a systematic review on the incidence of PID among IUD initiators, or IUD removal as a result of PID, suggested that the incidence of PID did not differ between women using Cu-IUDs and those using DMPA, COCs, or LNG-IUDs  (Level of evidence: I to II-2, good, indirect). Evidence on the timing of PID after IUD insertion is mixed. Although the rate of PID generally was low, the largest study suggested that the rate of PID was significantly higher in the first 20 days after insertion  (Level of evidence: I to II-3, good to poor, indirect).\n\n【30】 #Bleeding Irregularities with Cu-IUD Use\n- Before Cu-IUD insertion, provide counseling about potential changes in bleeding patterns during Cu-IUD use. Unscheduled spotting or light bleeding, as well as heavy or prolonged bleeding, is common during the first 3-6 months of Cu-IUD use, is generally not harmful, and decreases with continued Cu-IUD use. - If clinically indicated, consider an underlying gynecological problem, such as Cu-IUD displacement, an STD, pregnancy, or new pathologic uterine conditions (e.g. polyps or fibroids), especially in women who have already been using the Cu-IUD for a few months or longer and who have developed a new onset of heavy or prolonged bleeding. If an underlying gynecological problem is found, treat the condition or refer for care Comments and Evidence Summary. During contraceptive counseling and before insertion of the Cu-IUD, information about common side effects such as unscheduled spotting or light bleeding or heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding, especially during the first 3-6 months of use, should be discussed . These bleeding irregularities are generally not harmful. Enhanced counseling about expected bleeding patterns and reassurance that bleeding irregularities are generally not harmful has been shown to reduce method discontinuation in clinical trials with other contraceptives (i.e. DMPA) .\nEvidence is limited on specific drugs, doses, and durations of use for effective treatments for bleeding irregularities with Cu-IUD use. Therefore, although this report includes general recommendations for treatments to consider, evidence for specific regimens is lacking.\nA systematic review identified 11 studies that examined various therapeutic treatments for heavy menstrual bleeding, prolonged menstrual bleeding, or both among women using Cu-IUDs . Nine studies examined the use of various oral NSAIDs for the treatment of heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding among Cu-IUD users and compared them with either a placebo or a baseline cycle. Three of these trials examined the use of indomethacin , three examined mefenamic acid , and three examined flufenamic acid .\n\n【31】 #Bleeding Irregularities (Including Amenorrhea) with LNG-IUD Use\n- Before LNG-IUD insertion, provide counseling about potential changes in bleeding patterns during LNG-IUD use. Unscheduled spotting or light bleeding is expected during the first 3-6 months of LNG-IUD use, is generally not harmful, and decreases with continued LNG-IUD use. Over time, bleeding generally decreases with LNG-IUD use, and many women experience only light menstrual bleeding or amenorrhea. Heavy or prolonged bleeding, either unscheduled or menstrual, is uncommon during LNG-IUD use.\n\n【32】 #Irregular Bleeding (Spotting, Light Bleeding, or Heavy or Prolonged Bleeding)\n- If clinically indicated, consider an underlying gynecological problem, such as LNG-IUD displacement, an STD, pregnancy, or new pathologic uterine conditions (e.g. polyps or fibroids). If an underlying gynecological problem is found, treat the condition or refer for care. - If bleeding persists and the woman finds it unacceptable, counsel her on alternative contraceptive methods, and offer another method if it is desired.\n\n【33】 #Amenorrhea - Amenorrhea does not require any medical treatment. Provide reassurance.\n-If a woman's regular bleeding pattern changes abruptly to amenorrhea, consider ruling out pregnancy if clinically indicated. - If amenorrhea persists and the woman finds it unacceptable, counsel her on alternative contraceptive methods, and offer another method if it is desired Comments and Evidence Summary. During contraceptive counseling and before insertion of the LNG-IUD, information about common side effects such as unscheduled spotting or light bleeding, especially during the first 3-6 months of use, should be discussed. Approximately half of LNG-IUD users are likely to experience amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea by 2 years of use . These bleeding irregularities are generally not harmful. Enhanced counseling about expected bleeding patterns and reassurance that bleeding irregularities are generally not harmful has been shown to reduce method discontinuation in clinical trials with other hormonal contraceptives (i.e. DMPA) . No direct evidence was found regarding therapeutic treatments for bleeding irregularities during LNG-IUD use.\n\n【34】 #Management of the IUD when a Cu-IUD or an LNG-IUD User Is Found To Have PID\n- Treat the PID according to the CDC Sexually Transmitted Diseases Treatment Guidelines . - Provide comprehensive management for STDs, including counseling about condom use. - The IUD does not need to be removed immediately if the woman needs ongoing contraception. - Reassess the woman in 48-72 hours. If no clinical improvement occurs, continue antibiotics and consider removal of the IUD. - If the woman wants to discontinue use, remove the IUD sometime after antibiotics have been started to avoid the potential risk for bacterial spread resulting from the removal procedure. - If the IUD is removed, consider ECPs if appropriate.\nCounsel the woman on alternative contraceptive methods, and offer another method if it is desired. - A summary of IUD management in women with PID is provided . Comments and Evidence Summary. Treatment outcomes do not generally differ between women with PID who retain the IUD and those who have the IUD removed; however, appropriate antibiotic treatment and close clinical follow-up are necessary.\nA systematic review identified four studies that included women using copper or nonhormonal IUDs who developed PID and compared outcomes between women who had the IUD removed or did not . One randomized trial showed that women with IUDs removed had longer hospitalizations than those who did not, although no differences in PID recurrences or subsequent pregnancies were observed . Another randomized trial showed no differences in laboratory findings among women who removed the IUD compared with those who did not . One prospective cohort study showed no differences in clinical or laboratory findings during hospitalization; however, the IUD removal group had longer hospitalizations . One randomized trial showed that the rate of recovery for most clinical signs and symptoms was higher among women who had the IUD removed than among women who did not . No evidence was found regarding women using LNG-IUDs (Level of evidence: I to II-2, fair, direct.)\n\n【35】 #Management of the IUD when a Cu-IUD or an LNG-IUD User is Found To Be Pregnant\n- Evaluate for possible ectopic pregnancy.\n- Advise the woman that she has an increased risk for spontaneous abortion (including septic abortion that might be life threatening) and for preterm delivery if the IUD is left in place. The removal of the IUD reduces these risks but might not decrease the risk to the baseline level of a pregnancy without an IUD.\n-If she does not want to continue the pregnancy, counsel her about options. -If she wants to continue the pregnancy, advise her to seek care promptly if she has heavy bleeding, cramping, pain, abnormal vaginal discharge, or fever.\n\n【36】 #IUD Strings Are Visible or Can Be Retrieved Safely from the Cervical Canal\n- Advise the woman that the IUD should be removed as soon as possible.\n-If the IUD is to be removed, remove it by pulling on the strings gently. -Advise the woman that she should return promptly if she has heavy bleeding, cramping, pain, abnormal vaginal discharge, or fever. - If she chooses to keep the IUD, advise her to seek care promptly if she has heavy bleeding, cramping, pain, abnormal vaginal discharge, or fever.\n\n【37】 #IUD Strings Are Not Visible and Cannot Be Safely Retrieved\n- If ultrasonography is available, consider performing or referring for ultrasound examination to determine the location of the IUD. If the IUD cannot be located, it might have been expelled or have perforated the uterine wall. - If ultrasonography is not possible or the IUD is determined by ultrasound to be inside the uterus, advise the woman to seek care promptly if she has heavy bleeding, cramping, pain, abnormal vaginal discharge, or fever. Comments and Evidence Summary. Removing the IUD improves the pregnancy outcome if the IUD strings are visible or the device can be retrieved safely from the cervical canal. Risks for spontaneous abortion, preterm delivery, and infection are substantial if the IUD is left in place.\nTheoretically, the fetus might be affected by hormonal exposure from an LNG-IUD. However, whether this exposure increases the risk for fetal abnormalities is unknown.\nA systematic review identified nine studies suggesting that women who did not remove their IUDs during pregnancy were at greater risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes (including spontaneous abortion, septic abortion, preterm delivery, and chorioamnionitis) compared with women who had their IUDs removed or who did not have an IUD . Cu-IUD removal decreased risks but not to the baseline risk for pregnancies without an IUD. One case series examined LNG-IUDs. When they were not removed, 8 out of 10 pregnancies ended in spontaneous abortions (Level of evidence: II-2, fair, direct).\n\n【38】 #Implants\nThe etonogestrel implant, a single rod with 68 mg of etonogestrel, is available in the United States. Fewer than 1 woman out of 100 become pregnant in the first year of use of the etonogestrel implant with typical use . The implant is long acting, is reversible, and can be used by women of all ages, including adolescents. The implant does not protect against STDs; consistent and correct use of male latex condoms reduces the risk for STDs, including HIV.\n\n【39】 #Initiation of Implants Timing\n- The implant can be inserted at any time if it is reasonably certain that the woman is not pregnant .\n\n【40】 #Need for Back-Up Contraception\n- If the implant is inserted within the first 5 days since menstrual bleeding started, no additional contraceptive protection is needed. - If the implant is inserted >5 days since menstrual bleeding started, the woman needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use additional contraceptive protection for the next 7 days.\n\n【41】 #Special Considerations\nAmenorrhea (Not Postpartum)\n- Timing: The implant can be inserted at any time if it is reasonably certain that the woman is not pregnant . - Need for back-up contraception: The woman needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use additional contraceptive protection for the next 7 days.\n\n【42】 #Postabortion (Spontaneous or Induced)\n- Timing: The implant can be inserted within the first 7 days, including immediately after the abortion (U.S. MEC 1). - Need for back-up contraception: The woman needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use additional contraceptive protection for the next 7 days unless the implant is placed at the time of a surgical abortion.\n\n【43】 #Switching from Another Contraceptive Method\n- Timing: The implant can be inserted immediately if it is reasonably certain that the woman is not pregnant . Waiting for her next menstrual cycle is unnecessary. - Need for back-up contraception: If it has been >5 days since menstrual bleeding started, the woman needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use additional contraceptive protection for the next 7 days after insertion. - Switching from an IUD: If the woman has had sexual intercourse since the start of her current menstrual cycle and it has been >5 days since menstrual bleeding started, theoretically, residual sperm might be in the genital tract, which could lead to fertilization if ovulation occurs. A health care provider may consider any of the following options:\n-Advise the woman to retain the IUD for at least 7 days after the implant is inserted and return for IUD removal. -Advise the woman to abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier contraception for 7 days before removing the IUD and switching to the new method. -If the woman cannot return for IUD removal and has not abstained from sexual intercourse or used barrier contraception for 7 days, advise the woman to use ECPs (with the exception of UPA) at the time of IUD removal. Comments and Evidence Summary. In situations in which the health care provider is uncertain whether the woman might be pregnant, the benefits of starting the implant likely exceed any risk; therefore, starting the implant should be considered at any time, with a follow-up pregnancy test in 2-4 weeks.\nIf a woman needs to use additional contraceptive protection when switching to an implant from another contraceptive method, consider continuing her previous method for 7 days after implant insertion. No direct evidence was found regarding the effects of starting the etonogestrel implant at different times of the cycle.\n\n【44】 #Examinations and Tests Needed Before Implant Insertion\nAmong healthy women, no examinations or tests are needed before initiation of an implant, although a baseline weight and BMI measurement might be useful for monitoring implant users over time . Women with known medical problems or other special conditions might need additional examinations or tests before being determined to be appropriate candidates for a particular method of contraception. U.S. MEC might be useful in such circumstances .\nComments and Evidence Summary. Weight (BMI): Obese women can use implants (U.S. MEC 1) ; therefore, screening for obesity is not necessary for the safe initiation of implants. However, measuring weight and calculating BMI at baseline might be helpful for monitoring any changes and counseling women who might be concerned about weight change perceived to be associated with their contraceptive method.\nBimanual examination and cervical inspection: A pelvic examination is not necessary before initiation of implants because it would not facilitate detection of conditions for which implant use would be unsafe. Women with current breast cancer should not use implants (U.S. MEC 4); women with certain liver diseases generally should not (U.S. MEC 3) use implants . However, none of these conditions are likely to be detected by pelvic examination . A systematic review identified two case-control studies that compared delayed and immediate pelvic examination before initiation of hormonal contraceptives, specifically oral contraceptives or DMPA . No differences in risk factors for cervical neoplasia, incidence of STDs, incidence of abnormal Papanicolaou smears, or incidence of abnormal wet mounts were observed. No evidence was found regarding implants (Level of evidence: II-2 fair, direct).\nLipids: Screening for dyslipidemias is not necessary for the safe initiation of implants because of the low prevalence of undiagnosed disease in women of reproductive age and the low likelihood of clinically significant changes with use of hormonal contraceptives. A systematic review did not identify any evidence regarding outcomes among women who were screened versus not screened with lipid measurement before initiation of hormonal contraceptives . During 2009-2012 among women aged 20-44 years in the United States, 7.6% had high cholesterol, defined as total serum cholesterol ≥240 mg/ dL . During 1999-2008, the prevalence of undiagnosed hypercholesterolemia among women aged 20-44 years was approximately 2% . Studies have shown mixed results regarding the effects of hormonal methods on lipid levels among both healthy women and women with baseline lipid abnormalities, and the clinical significance of these changes is unclear .\nLiver enzymes: Although women with certain liver diseases generally should not use implants (U.S. MEC 3) , screening for liver disease before initiation of implants is not necessary because of the low prevalence of these conditions and the high likelihood that women with liver disease already would have had the condition diagnosed. A systematic review did not identify any evidence regarding outcomes among women who were screened versus not screened with liver enzyme tests before initiation of hormonal contraceptives . In 2012, the percentage of U.S. women with liver disease (not further specified) was 1.3% . In 2013, the incidence of acute hepatitis A, B, or C was ≤1 per 100,000 U.S. population . During 2002-2011, the incidence of liver carcinoma among U.S. women was approximately 3.7 per 100,000 population . Because estrogen and progestins are metabolized in the liver, the use of hormonal contraceptives among women with liver disease might, theoretically, be a concern. The use of hormonal contraceptives, specifically COCs and POPs, does not affect disease progression or severity in women with hepatitis, cirrhosis, or benign focal nodular hyperplasia , although evidence is limited and no evidence exists for implants.\nClinical breast examination: Although women with current breast cancer should not use implants (U.S. MEC 4) , screening asymptomatic women with a clinical breast - Class A: essential and mandatory in all circumstances for safe and effective use of the contraceptive method. Class B: contributes substantially to safe and effective use, but implementation may be considered within the public health and/or service context; the risk of not performing an examination or test should be balanced against the benefits of making the contraceptive method available. Class C: does not contribute substantially to safe and effective use of the contraceptive method.  Weight (BMI) measurement is not needed to determine medical eligibility for any methods of contraception because all methods can be used (U.S. MEC 1) or generally can be used (U.S. MEC 2) among obese women . However, measuring weight and calculating BMI at baseline might be helpful for monitoring any changes and counseling women who might be concerned about weight change perceived to be associated with their contraceptive method. examination before initiation of implants is not necessary because of the low prevalence of breast cancer among women of reproductive age (15-49 years). A systematic review did not identify any evidence regarding outcomes among women who were screened versus not screened with a breast examination before initiation of hormonal contraceptives . The incidence of breast cancer among women of reproductive age in the United States is low. In 2012, the incidence of breast cancer among women aged 20-49 years was approximately 70.7 per 100,000 women .\nOther screening: Women with hypertension, diabetes, anemia, thrombogenic mutations, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, cervical cancer, STDs, or HIV infection can use (U.S. MEC 1) or generally can use (U.S. MEC 2) implants ; therefore, screening for these conditions is not necessary for the safe initiation of implants.\n\n【45】 #Routine Follow-Up After Implant Insertion\nThese recommendations address when routine follow-up is needed for safe and effective continued use of contraception for healthy women, Specific populations who might benefit from more frequent follow-up visits include adolescents, those with certain medical conditions or characteristics, and those with multiple medical conditions.\n- Advise the woman to return at any time to discuss side effects or other problems, if she wants to change the method being used, and when it is time to remove or replace the contraceptive method. No routine follow-up visit is required. - At other routine visits, health care providers seeing implant users should do the following: -Assess the woman's satisfaction with her contraceptive method and whether she has any concerns about method use. -Assess any changes in health status, including medications, that would change the appropriateness of the implant for safe and effective continued use based on U.S. MEC (e.g. category 3 and 4 conditions and characteristics). -Consider assessing weight changes and counseling women who are concerned about weight change perceived to be associated with their contraceptive method. Comments and Evidence Summary. A systematic review did not identify any evidence regarding whether a routine follow-up visit after initiating an implant improves correct or continued use .\n\n【46】 #Bleeding Irregularities (Including Amenorrhea) During Implant Use\n- Before implant insertion, provide counseling about potential changes in bleeding patterns during implant use. Unscheduled spotting or light bleeding is common with implant use, and some women experience amenorrhea. These bleeding changes are generally not harmful and might or might not decrease with continued implant use. Heavy or prolonged bleeding, unscheduled or menstrual, is uncommon during implant use.\nIrregular Bleeding (Spotting, Light Bleeding, or Heavy or Prolonged Bleeding)\n- If clinically indicated, consider an underlying gynecological problem, such as interactions with other medications, an STD, pregnancy, or new pathologic uterine conditions (e.g. polyps or fibroids). If an underlying gynecological problem is found, treat the condition or refer for care\n\n【47】 #Amenorrhea - Amenorrhea does not require any medical treatment. Provide reassurance.\n-If a woman's regular bleeding pattern changes abruptly to amenorrhea, consider ruling out pregnancy if clinically indicated. - If amenorrhea persists and the woman finds it unacceptable, counsel her on alternative contraceptive methods, and offer another method if it is desired. Comments and Evidence Summary. During contraceptive counseling and before insertion of the implant, information about common side effects, such as unscheduled spotting or light bleeding and amenorrhea, especially during the first year of use, should be discussed. A pooled analysis of data from 11 clinical trials indicates that a significant proportion of etonogestrel implant users had relatively little bleeding: 22% of women experienced amenorrhea and 34% experienced infrequent spotting, although 7% reported frequent bleeding and 18% reported prolonged bleeding . Unscheduled bleeding or amenorrhea is generally not harmful. Enhanced counseling about expected bleeding patterns and reassurance that bleeding irregularities are generally not harmful has been shown to reduce discontinuation in clinical trials with other hormonal contraceptives (i.e. DMPA) .\nA systematic review and four newly published studies examined several medications for the treatment of bleeding irregularities with primarily levonorgestrel contraceptive implants . Two small studies found significant cessation of bleeding within 7 days of start of treatment among women taking oral celecoxib (200 mg) daily for 5 days or oral mefenamic acid (500 mg) 3 times daily for 5 days compared with placebo .\n\n【48】 #Injectables\nProgestin-only injectable contraceptives (DMPA, 150 mg intramuscularly or 104 mg subcutaneously) are available in the United States; the only difference between these two formulations is the route of administration. Approximately 6 out of 100 women will become pregnant in the first year of use of DMPA with typical use . DMPA is reversible and can be used by women of all ages, including adolescents. DMPA does not protect against STDs; consistent and correct use of male latex condoms reduces the risk for STDs, including HIV.\n\n【49】 #Initiation of Injectables Timing\n- The first DMPA injection can be given at any time if it is reasonably certain that the woman is not pregnant .\n\n【50】 #Need for Back-Up Contraception\n- If DMPA is started within the first 7 days since menstrual bleeding started, no additional contraceptive protection is needed. - If DMPA is started >7 days since menstrual bleeding started, the woman needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use additional contraceptive protection for the next 7 days.\n\n【51】 #Special Considerations\nAmenorrhea (Not Postpartum)\n- Timing: The first DMPA injection can be given at any time if it is reasonably certain that the woman is not pregnant . - Need for back-up contraception: The woman needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use additional contraceptive protection for the next 7 days.\n\n【52】 #Postpartum (Breastfeeding)\n- Postabortion (Spontaneous or Induced)\n- Timing: The first DMPA injection can be given within the first 7 days, including immediately after the abortion (U.S. MEC 1). - Need for back-up contraception: The woman needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use additional contraceptive protection for the next 7 days unless the injection is given at the time of a surgical abortion.\n\n【53】 #Switching from Another Contraceptive Method\n- Timing: The first DMPA injection can be given immediately if it is reasonably certain that the woman is not pregnant . Waiting for her next menstrual cycle is unnecessary. - Need for back-up contraception: If it has been >7 days since menstrual bleeding started, the woman needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use additional contraceptive protection for the next 7 days. - Switching from an IUD: If the woman has had sexual intercourse since the start of her current menstrual cycle and it has been >5 days since menstrual bleeding started, theoretically, residual sperm might be in the genital tract, which could lead to fertilization if ovulation occurs. A health care provider may consider any of the following options: -Advise the women to retain the IUD for at least 7 days after the injection and return for IUD removal. -Advise the woman to abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier contraception for 7 days before removing the IUD and switching to the new method. -If the woman cannot return for IUD removal and has not abstained from sexual intercourse or used barrier contraception for 7 days, advise the woman to use ECPs (with the exception of UPA) at the time of IUD removal. Comments and Evidence Summary. In situations in which the health care provider is uncertain whether the woman might be pregnant, the benefits of starting DMPA likely exceed any risk; therefore, starting DMPA should be considered at any time, with a follow-up pregnancy test in 2-4 weeks. If a woman needs to use additional contraceptive protection when switching to DMPA from another contraceptive method, consider continuing her previous method for 7 days after DMPA injection.\nA systematic review identified eight articles examining DMPA initiation on different days of the menstrual cycle . Evidence from two studies with small sample sizes indicated that DMPA injections given up to day 7 of the menstrual cycle inhibited ovulation; when DMPA was administered after day 7, ovulation occurred in some women. Cervical mucus was of poor quality (i.e. not favorable for sperm penetration) in 90% of women within 24 hours of the injection (Level of evidence: II-2, fair) . Studies found that use of another contraceptive method until DMPA could be initiated (bridging option) did not help women initiate DMPA and was associated with more unintended pregnancies than immediate receipt of DMPA  (Level of evidence: I to II-3, fair to poor, indirect).\n\n【54】 #Examinations and Tests Needed Before Initiation of an Injectable\nAmong healthy women, no examinations or tests are needed before initiation of DMPA, although a baseline weight and BMI measurement might be useful to monitor DMPA users over time . Women with known medical problems or other special conditions might need additional examinations or tests before being determined to be appropriate candidates for a particular method of contraception. U.S. MEC might be useful in such circumstances .\nComments and Evidence Summary. Weight (BMI): Obese women can use (U.S. MEC 1) or generally can use (U.S. MEC 2) DMPA ; therefore, screening for obesity is not necessary for the safe initiation of DMPA. However, measuring weight and calculating BMI at baseline might be helpful for monitoring any changes and counseling women who might be concerned about weight change perceived to be associated with their contraceptive method,\nBimanual examination and cervical inspection: Pelvic examination is not necessary before initiation of DMPA because it does not facilitate detection of conditions for which DMPA would be unsafe. Although women with current breast cancer should not use DMPA (U.S. MEC 4), and women with severe hypertension, heart disease, vascular disease, or certain liver diseases generally should not use DMPA (U.S. MEC 3) , none of these conditions are likely to be detected by pelvic examination . A systematic review identified two casecontrol studies that compared delayed versus immediate pelvic examination before initiation of hormonal contraceptives, specifically oral contraceptives or DMPA . No differences in risk factors for cervical neoplasia, incidence of STDs, incidence of abnormal Papanicolaou smears, or incidence of abnormal wet mounts were observed (Level of evidence: II-2, fair, direct).\nBlood pressure: Women with hypertension generally can use DMPA (U.S. MEC 2), with the exception of women with severe hypertension or vascular disease, who generally should not use DMPA (U.S. MEC 3) . Screening for hypertension before initiation of DMPA is not necessary because of the low prevalence of undiagnosed severe hypertension and the high likelihood that women with these conditions already would have had them diagnosed. A systematic review did not identify any evidence regarding outcomes among women who were screened versus not screened with a blood pressure measurement before initiation of progestin-only contraceptives . The prevalence of undiagnosed hypertension among women of reproductive age is low. During 2009-2012 among women aged 20-44 years in the United States, the prevalence of hypertension was 8.7% . During 1999-2008, the percentage of women aged 20-44 years with undiagnosed hypertension was 1.9% .\nGlucose: Although women with complicated diabetes generally should not use DMPA (U.S. MEC 3) , screening for diabetes before initiation of DMPA is not necessary because of the low prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes and the high likelihood that women with complicated diabetes would already have had the condition diagnosed. A systematic review did not identify any evidence regarding outcomes among women who were screened versus not screened with glucose measurement before initiation of hormonal contraceptives . The prevalence of diabetes among women of reproductive age is low. During 2009-2012 among women aged 20-44 years in the United States, the prevalence of diabetes was 3.3% . During 1999-2008, the percentage of women aged 20-44 years with undiagnosed diabetes was 0.5% .\nAlthough hormonal contraceptives can have some adverse effects on glucose metabolism in healthy and diabetic women, the overall clinical effect is minimal .\nLipids: Screening for dyslipidemias is not necessary for the safe initiation of injectables because of the low prevalence of undiagnosed disease in women of reproductive age and the low likelihood of clinically significant changes with use of hormonal contraceptives. A systematic review did not identify any evidence regarding outcomes among women who were screened versus not screened with lipid measurement before initiation of hormonal contraceptives . During 2009-2012 among women aged 20-44 years in the United States, 7.6% had high cholesterol, defined as total serum cholesterol ≥240 mg/dL . During 1999-2008, the prevalence of undiagnosed hypercholesterolemia among women aged 20-44 years was approximately 2% . Studies have shown mixed results about the effects of hormonal methods on lipid levels among both healthy women and women with baseline lipid abnormalities, and the clinical significance of these changes is unclear .\nLiver enzymes: Although women with certain liver diseases generally should not use DMPA (U.S. MEC 3) , screening for liver disease before initiation of DMPA is not necessary because of the low prevalence of these conditions and the high likelihood that women with liver disease already would have had the condition diagnosed. A systematic review did not identify any evidence regarding outcomes among women who were screened versus not screened with liver enzyme tests before initiation of hormonal contraceptives . In 2012, among U.S. women, the percentage with liver disease (not further specified) was 1.3% . In 2013, the incidence of acute hepatitis A, B, or C was ≤1 per 100,000 U.S. population . During 2002-2011, the incidence of liver carcinoma among U.S. women was approximately 3.7 per 100,000 population . Because estrogen and progestins are metabolized in the liver, the use of hormonal contraceptives among women with liver disease might, theoretically, be a concern. The use of hormonal contraceptives, specifically COCs and POPs, does not affect disease progression or severity in women with hepatitis, cirrhosis, or benign focal nodular hyperplasia  among obese women . However, measuring weight and calculating BMI at baseline might be helpful for monitoring any changes and counseling women who might be concerned about weight change perceived to be associated with their contraceptive method.\n\n【55】 #Clinical breast examination:\nAlthough women with current breast cancer should not use DMPA (U.S. MEC 4) , screening asymptomatic women with a clinical breast examination before initiating DMPA is not necessary because of the low prevalence of breast cancer among women of reproductive age. A systematic review did not identify any evidence regarding outcomes among women who were screened versus not screened with a clinical breast examination before initiation of hormonal contraceptives . The incidence of breast cancer among women of reproductive age in the United States is low. In 2012, the incidence of breast cancer among women aged 20-49 years was approximately 70.7 per 100,000 women .\nOther screening: Women with anemia, thrombogenic mutations, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, cervical cancer, HIV infection, or other STDs can use (U.S. MEC 1) or generally can use (U.S. MEC 2) DMPA ; therefore, screening for these conditions is not necessary for the safe initiation of DMPA.\n\n【56】 #Routine Follow-Up After Injectable Initiation\nThese recommendations address when routine follow-up is recommended for safe and effective continued use of contraception for healthy women, Specific populations who might benefit from frequent follow-up visits include adolescents, those with certain medical conditions or characteristics, and those with multiple medical conditions.\n- Advise the woman to return at any time to discuss side effects or other problems, if she wants to change the method being used, and when it is time for reinjection.\nNo routine follow-up visit is required. - At other routine visits, health care providers seeing injectable users should do the following: -Assess the woman's satisfaction with her contraceptive method and whether she has any concerns about method use. -Assess any changes in health status, including medications, that would change the appropriateness of the injectable for safe and effective continued use based on U.S. MEC (e.g. category 3 and 4 conditions and characteristics). -Consider assessing weight changes and counseling women who are concerned about weight change perceived to be associated with their contraceptive method. Comments and Evidence Summary. Although no evidence exists regarding whether a routine follow-up visit after initiating DMPA improves correct or continued use, monitoring weight or BMI change over time is important for DMPA users.\nA systematic review identified a limited body of evidence that examined whether weight gain in the few months after DMPA initiation predicted future weight gain . Two studies found significant differences in weight gain or BMI at follow-up periods ranging from 12 to 36 months between early weight gainers (i.e. those who gained >5% of their baseline body weight within 6 months after initiation) and those who were not early weight gainers .\n\n【57】 #Timing of Repeat Injections Reinjection Interval\n- Provide repeat DMPA injections every 3 months (13 weeks).\n\n【58】 #Special Considerations Early Injection\n- The repeat DMPA injection can be given early when necessary.\n\n【59】 #Late Injection\n- The repeat DMPA injection can be given up to 2 weeks late (15 weeks from the last injection) without requiring additional contraceptive protection. - If the woman is >2 weeks late (>15 weeks from the last injection) for a repeat DMPA injection, she can have the injection if it is reasonably certain that she is not pregnant . She needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use additional contraceptive protection for the next 7 days. She might consider the use of emergency contraception (with the exception of UPA) if appropriate. Comments and Evidence Summary. No time limits exist for early injections; injections can be given when necessary (e.g. when a woman cannot return at the routine interval). WHO has extended the time that a woman can have a late reinjection (i.e. grace period) for DMPA use from 2 weeks to 4 weeks on the basis of data from one study showing low pregnancy rates through 4 weeks; however, the CDC expert group did not consider the data to be generalizable to the United States because a large proportion of women in the study were breastfeeding. Therefore, U.S. SPR recommends a grace period of 2 weeks.\nA systematic review identified 12 studies evaluating time to pregnancy or ovulation after the last injection of DMPA . Although pregnancy rates were low during the 2-week interval following the reinjection date and for 4 weeks following the reinjection date, data were sparse, and one study included a large proportion of breastfeeding women . Studies also indicated a wide variation in time to ovulation after the last DMPA injection, with the majority ranging from 15 to 49 weeks from the last injection\n\n【60】 #Unscheduled Spotting or Light Bleeding\n- If clinically indicated, consider an underlying gynecological problem, such as interactions with other medications, an STD, pregnancy, or new pathologic uterine conditions (e.g. polyps or fibroids). If an underlying gynecological problem is found, treat the condition or refer for care\n\n【61】 #Heavy or Prolonged Bleeding\n- If clinically indicated, consider an underlying gynecological problem, such as interactions with other medications, an STD, pregnancy, or new pathologic uterine conditions (such as fibroids or polyps). If an underlying gynecologic problem is identified, treat the condition or refer for care\n\n【62】 #Amenorrhea - Amenorrhea does not require any medical treatment. Provide reassurance.\n-If a woman's regular bleeding pattern changes abruptly to amenorrhea, consider ruling out pregnancy if clinically indicated. - If amenorrhea persists and the woman finds it unacceptable, counsel her on alternative contraceptive methods, and offer another method if it is desired. Comments and Evidence Summary. During contraceptive counseling and before initiation of DMPA, information about common side effects such as irregular bleeding should be discussed. Unscheduled bleeding or spotting is common with DMPA use . In addition, amenorrhea is common after ≥1 years of continuous use .\nA systematic review, as well as two additional studies, examined the treatment of bleeding irregularities during DMPA use . Two small studies found significant cessation of bleeding within 7 days of starting treatment among women taking valdecoxib for 5 days or mefenamic acid for 5 days compared with placebo . No studies examined the effects of aspirin on bleeding irregularities among DMPA users.\n\n【63】 #Combined Hormonal Contraceptives\nCombined hormonal contraceptives contain both estrogen and a progestin and include 1 COCs (various formulations), 2 a transdermal contraceptive patch (which releases 150 µg of norelgestromin and 20 µg ethinyl estradiol daily), and 3 a vaginal contraceptive ring (which releases 120 µg etonogestrel and 15 µg ethinyl estradiol daily). Approximately 9 out of 100 women become pregnant in the first year of use with combined hormonal contraceptives with typical use . These methods are reversible and can be used by women of all ages. Combined hormonal contraceptives are generally used for US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 21-24 consecutive days, followed by 4-7 hormone-free days (either no use or placebo pills). These methods are sometimes used for an extended period with infrequent or no hormonefree days. Combined hormonal contraceptives do not protect against STDs; consistent and correct use of male latex condoms reduces the risk for STDs, including HIV.\n\n【64】 #Initiation of Combined Hormonal Contraceptives Timing\n- Combined hormonal contraceptives can be initiated at any time if it is reasonably certain that the woman is not pregnant .\n\n【65】 #Need for Back-Up Contraception\n- If combined hormonal contraceptives are started within the first 5 days since menstrual bleeding started, no additional contraceptive protection is needed. - If combined hormonal contraceptives are started >5 days since menstrual bleeding started, the woman needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use additional contraceptive protection for the next 7 days.\n\n【66】 #Special Considerations\nAmenorrhea (Not Postpartum)\n- Timing: Combined hormonal contraceptives can be started at any time if it is reasonably certain that the woman is not pregnant . - Need for back-up contraception: The woman needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use additional contraceptive protection for the next 7 days.\n\n【67】 #Postpartum (Breastfeeding)\n- Timing: Combined hormonal contraceptives can be started when the woman is medically eligible to use the method  and if it is reasonably certain that she is not pregnant.\n\n【68】 #Postabortion (Spontaneous or Induced)\n- Timing: Combined hormonal contraceptives can be started within the first 7 days following first-trimester or second-trimester abortion, including immediately postabortion (U.S. MEC 1). - Need for back-up contraception: The woman needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use additional contraceptive protection for the next 7 days unless combined hormonal contraceptives are started at the time of a surgical abortion.\n\n【69】 #Switching from Another Contraceptive Method\n- Timing: Combined hormonal contraceptives can be started immediately if it is reasonably certain that the woman is not pregnant . Waiting for her next menstrual cycle is unnecessary. - Need for back-up contraception: If it has been >5 days since menstrual bleeding started, she needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use additional contraceptive protection for the next 7 days. - Switching from an IUD: If the woman has had sexual intercourse since the start of her current menstrual cycle and it has been >5 days since menstrual bleeding started, theoretically, residual sperm might be in the genital tract, which could lead to fertilization if ovulation occurs. A health care provider may consider any of the following options: -Advise the women to retain the IUD for at least 7 days after combined hormonal contraceptives are initiated and return for IUD removal. -Advise the woman to abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier contraception for 7 days before removing the IUD and switching to the new method. -If the woman cannot return for IUD removal and has not abstained from sexual intercourse or used barrier contraception for 7 days, advise the woman to use ECPs at the time of IUD removal. Combined hormonal contraceptives can be started immediately after use of ECPs (with the exception of UPA). Combined hormonal contraceptives can be started no sooner than 5 days after use of UPA. Comments and Evidence Summary. In situations in which the health care provider is uncertain whether the woman might be pregnant, the benefits of starting combined hormonal contraceptives likely exceed any risk; therefore, starting combined hormonal contraceptives should be considered at any time, with a follow-up pregnancy test in 2-4 weeks. If a woman needs to use additional contraceptive protection when switching to combined hormonal contraceptives from another contraceptive method, consider continuing her previous method for 7 days after starting combined hormonal contraceptives.\nA systematic review of 18 studies examined the effects of starting combined hormonal contraceptives on different days of the menstrual cycle . Overall, the evidence suggested that pregnancy rates did not differ by the timing of combined hormonal contraceptive initiation ,169, (Level of evidence: I to II-3, fair, indirect). The more follicular activity that occurred before starting COCs, the more likely ovulation was to occur; however, no ovulations occurred when COCs were started at a follicle diameter of 10 mm (mean cycle day 7.6) or when the ring was started at 13 mm (median cycle day 11)  (Level of evidence: I to II-3, fair, indirect). Bleeding patterns and other side effects did not vary with the timing of combined hormonal contraceptive initiation ,204,205, (Level of evidence: I to II-2, good to poor, direct). Although continuation rates of combined hormonal contraceptives were initially improved by the \"quick start\" approach (i.e. starting on the day of the visit), the advantage disappeared over time ,203,204, (Level of evidence: I to II-2, good to poor, direct).\n\n【70】 #Examinations and Test Needed Before Initiation of Combined Hormonal Contraceptives\nAmong healthy women, few examinations or tests are needed before initiation of combined hormonal contraceptives . Blood pressure should be measured before initiation of combined hormonal contraceptives. Baseline weight and BMI measurements might be useful for monitoring combined hormonal contraceptive users over time. Women with known medical problems or other special conditions might need additional examinations or tests before being determined to be appropriate candidates for a particular method of contraception. U.S. MEC might be useful in such circumstances .\nComments and Evidence Summary. Blood pressure: Women who have more severe hypertension (systolic pressure of ≥160 mmHg or diastolic pressure of ≥100 mm Hg) or vascular disease should not use combined hormonal contraceptives (U.S. MEC 4), and women who have less severe hypertension (systolic pressure of 140-159 mm Hg or diastolic pressure of 90-99 mm Hg) or adequately controlled hypertension generally should not use combined hormonal contraceptives (U.S. MEC 3) . Therefore, blood pressure should be evaluated before initiating combined hormonal contraceptives. In instances in which blood pressure cannot be measured by a provider, blood pressure measured in other settings can be reported by the woman to her provider. Evidence suggests that cardiovascular outcomes are worse among women who did not have their blood pressure measured before initiating COCs. A systematic review identified six articles from three studies that reported cardiovascular outcomes among women who had blood pressure measurements and women who did not have blood pressure measurements before initiating COCs . Three case-control studies showed that women who did not have blood pressure measurements before initiating COCs had a higher risk for acute myocardial infarction than women who did have blood pressure measurements . Two case-control studies showed that women who did not have blood pressure measurements before initiating COCs had a higher risk for ischemic stroke than women who did have blood pressure measurements .\n\n【71】 #Weight (BMI):\nObese women generally can use combined hormonal contraceptives (U.S. MEC 2) ; therefore, screening for obesity is not necessary for the safe initiation of combined hormonal contraceptives. However, measuring weight and calculating BMI at baseline might be helpful for monitoring any changes and counseling women who might be concerned about weight change perceived to be associated with their contraceptive method.\nBimanual examination and cervical inspection: Pelvic examination is not necessary before initiation of combined hormonal contraceptives because it does not facilitate detection of conditions for which hormonal contraceptives would be unsafe. Women with certain conditions such as current breast cancer, severe hypertension or vascular disease, heart disease, migraine headaches with aura, and certain liver diseases, as well as women aged ≥35 years and who smoke ≥15 cigarettes per day, should not use (U.S. MEC 4) or generally should not use (U.S. MEC 3) combined hormonal contraceptives ; however, none of these conditions are likely to be detected by pelvic examination . A systematic review identified two case-control studies that compared delayed and immediate pelvic examination before initiation of hormonal contraceptives, specifically oral contraceptives or DMPA . No differences in risk factors for cervical neoplasia, incidence of STDs, incidence of abnormal Papanicolaou smears, or incidence of abnormal wet mounts were found (Level of evidence: Level II-2 fair, direct).\nGlucose: Although women with complicated diabetes should not use (U.S. MEC 4) or generally should not use (U.S. MEC 3) combined hormonal contraceptives, depending on the severity of the condition , screening for diabetes before initiation of hormonal contraceptives is not necessary because of the low prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes and the high likelihood that women with complicated diabetes already would have had the condition diagnosed. A systematic review did not identify any evidence regarding outcomes among women who were screened versus not screened with glucose measurement before initiation of hormonal contraceptives . The prevalence of diabetes among women of reproductive age is low. During 2009-2012 among women aged 20-44 years in the United States, the prevalence of diabetes was 3.3% . During 1999-2008, the percentage of women aged 20-44 years with undiagnosed diabetes was 0.5% . Although hormonal contraceptives can have some adverse effects on glucose metabolism in healthy and diabetic women, the overall clinical effect is minimal .\nLipids: Screening for dyslipidemias is not necessary for the safe initiation of combined hormonal contraceptives because of the low prevalence of undiagnosed disease in women of reproductive age and the low likelihood of clinically significant changes with use of hormonal contraceptives. A systematic review did not identify any evidence regarding outcomes among women who were screened versus not screened with lipid measurement before initiation of hormonal contraceptives . During 2009-2012 among women aged 20-44 years in the United States, 7.6% had high cholesterol, defined as total serum cholesterol ≥240 mg/dL . During 1999-2008, the prevalence of undiagnosed hypercholesterolemia among women aged 20-44 years was approximately 2% . A systematic review identified few studies, all of poor quality, that suggest that women with known dyslipidemias using combined hormonal contraceptives might be at increased risk for myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, or venous thromboembolism compared with women without dyslipidemias; no studies were identified that examined risk for pancreatitis among women with known dyslipidemias using combined hormonal contraceptives . Studies have shown mixed results regarding the effects of hormonal contraceptives on lipid levels among both healthy women and women with - Class A: essential and mandatory in all circumstances for safe and effective use of the contraceptive method. Class B: contributes substantially to safe and effective use, but implementation may be considered within the public health and/or service context; the risk of not performing an examination or test should be balanced against the benefits of making the contraceptive method available. Class C: does not contribute substantially to safe and effective use of the contraceptive method.  In instances in which blood pressure cannot be measured by a provider, blood pressure measured in other settings can be reported by the woman to her provider.  Weight (BMI) measurement is not needed to determine medical eligibility for any methods of contraception because all methods can be used (U.S. MEC 1) or generally can be used (U.S. MEC 2) among obese women . However, measuring weight and calculating BMI at baseline might be helpful for monitoring any changes and counseling women who might be concerned about weight change perceived to be associated with their contraceptive method.\nbaseline lipid abnormalities, and the clinical significance of these changes is unclear .\nLiver enzymes: Although women with certain liver diseases should not use (U.S. MEC 4) or generally should not use (U.S. MEC 3) combined hormonal contraceptives , screening for liver disease before initiation of combined hormonal contraceptives is not necessary because of the low prevalence of these conditions and the high likelihood that women with liver disease already would have had the condition diagnosed. A systematic review did not identify any evidence regarding outcomes among women who were screened versus not screened with liver enzyme tests before initiation of hormonal contraceptives . In 2012, among U.S. women, the percentage with liver disease (not further specified) was 1.3% . In 2013, the incidence of acute hepatitis A, B, or C was ≤1 per 100,000 U.S. population . During 2002-2011, the incidence of liver carcinoma among U.S. women was approximately 3.7 per 100,000 population . Because estrogen and progestins are metabolized in the liver, the use of hormonal contraceptives among women with liver disease might, theoretically, be a concern. The use of hormonal contraceptives, specifically COCs and POPs, does not affect disease progression or severity in women with hepatitis, cirrhosis, or benign focal nodular hyperplasia , although evidence is limited; no evidence exists for other types of combined hormonal contraceptives.\nThrombogenic mutations: Women with thrombogenic mutations should not use combined hormonal contraceptives (U.S. MEC 4)  because of the increased risk for venous thromboembolism . However, studies have shown that universal screening for thrombogenic mutations before initiating COCs is not cost-effective because of the rarity of the conditions and the high cost of screening .\nClinical breast examination: Although women with current breast cancer should not use combined hormonal contraceptives (U.S. MEC 4) , screening asymptomatic women with a clinical breast examination before initiating combined hormonal contraceptives is not necessary because of the low prevalence of breast cancer among women of reproductive age. A systematic review did not identify any evidence regarding outcomes among women who were screened versus not screened with a breast examination before initiation of hormonal contraceptives . The incidence of breast cancer among women of reproductive age in the United States is low. In 2012, the incidence of breast cancer among women aged 20-49 years was approximately 70.7 per 100,000 women .\nOther screening: Women with anemia, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, cervical cancer, HIV infection, or other STDs can use (U.S. MEC 1) or generally can use (U.S. MEC 2) combined hormonal contraceptives ; therefore, screening for these conditions is not necessary for the safe initiation of combined hormonal contraceptives.\n\n【72】 #Number of Pill Packs that Should Be Provided at Initial and Return Visits\n- At the initial and return visits, provide or prescribe up to a 1-year supply of COCs (e.g. 13 28-day pill packs), depending on the woman's preferences and anticipated use. - A woman should be able to obtain COCs easily in the amount and at the time she needs them. Comments and Evidence Summary. The more pill packs given up to 13 cycles, the higher the continuation rates. Restricting the number of pill packs distributed or prescribed can result in unwanted discontinuation of the method and increased risk for pregnancy.\nA systematic review of the evidence suggested that providing a greater number of pill packs was associated with increased continuation . Studies that compared provision of one versus 12 packs, one versus 12 or 13 packs, or three versus seven packs found increased continuation of pill use among women provided with more pill packs . However, one study found no difference in continuation when patients were provided one and then three packs versus four packs all at once . In addition to continuation, a greater number of pills packs provided was associated with fewer pregnancy tests, fewer pregnancies, and lower cost per client. However, a greater number of pill packs (i.e. 13 packs versus three packs) also was associated with increased pill wastage in one study  (Level of evidence: I to II-2, fair, direct).\n\n【73】 #Routine Follow-Up After Combined Hormonal Contraceptive Initiation\nThese recommendations address when routine follow-up is recommended for safe and effective continued use of contraception for healthy women, Specific populations who might benefit from more frequent follow-up visits include adolescents, those with certain medical conditions or characteristics, and those with multiple medical conditions.\n- Advise the woman to return at any time to discuss side effects or other problems or if she wants to change the method being used. No routine follow-up visit is required. - At other routine visits, health care providers seeing combined hormonal contraceptive users should do the following:\n-Assess the woman's satisfaction with her contraceptive method and whether she has any concerns about method use. -Assess any changes in health status, including medications, that would change the appropriateness of combined hormonal contraceptives for safe and effective continued use based on U.S. MEC (e.g. category 3 and 4 conditions and characteristics). -Assess blood pressure.\n-Consider assessing weight changes and counseling women who are concerned about weight change perceived to be associated with their contraceptive method. Comments and Evidence Summary. No evidence exists regarding whether a routine follow-up visit after initiating combined hormonal contraceptives improves correct or continued use. Monitoring blood pressure is important for combined hormonal contraceptive users. Health care providers might consider recommending women obtain blood pressure measurements in other settings.\nA systematic review identified five studies that examined the incidence of hypertension among women who began using a COC versus those who started a nonhormonal method of contraception or a placebo . Few women developed hypertension after initiating COCs, and studies examining increases in blood pressure after COC initiation found mixed results. No studies were identified that examined changes in blood pressure among patch or vaginal ring users (Level of evidence: I, fair, to II-2, fair, indirect).\n\n【74】 #Late or Missed Doses and Side Effects from Combined Hormonal Contraceptive Use\nFor the following recommendations, a dose is considered late when <24 hours have elapsed since the dose should have been taken. A dose is considered missed if ≥24 hours have elapsed since the dose should have been taken. For example, if a COC pill was supposed to have been taken on Monday at 9:00 a.m. and is taken at 11:00 a.m. the pill is late; however, by Tuesday morning at 11:00 a.m. Monday's 9:00 a.m. pill has been missed and Tuesday's 9:00 a.m. pill is late. For COCs, the recommendations only apply to late or missed hormonally active pills and not to placebo pills. Recommendations are provided for late or missed pills , the patch , and the ring .\nComments and Evidence Summary. Inconsistent or incorrect use of combined hormonal contraceptives is a major cause of combined hormonal contraceptive failure. Extending the hormone-free interval is considered to be a particularly risky time to miss combined hormonal contraceptives. Seven days of continuous combined hormonal contraceptive use is deemed necessary to reliably prevent ovulation. The recommendations reflect a balance between simplicity and precision of science. Women who frequently miss COCs or experience other usage errors with combined hormonal patch or combined vaginal ring should consider an alternative contraceptive method that is less dependent on the user to be effective (e.g. IUD, implant, or injectable).\nA systematic review identified 36 studies that examined measures of contraceptive effectiveness of combined hormonal contraceptives during cycles with extended hormone-free intervals, shortened hormone-free intervals, or deliberate nonadherence on days not adjacent to the hormone-free interval . Most of the studies examined COCs ,215, two examined the combined hormonal patch\n- Take the late or missed pill as soon as possible.\n- Continue taking the remaining pills at the usual time (even if it means taking two pills on the same day).\n- No additional contraceptive protection is needed. - Emergency contraception is not usually needed but can be considered (with the exception of UPA) if hormonal pills were missed earlier in the cycle or in the last week of the previous cycle.\n- Take the most recent missed pill as soon as possible. (Any other missed pills should be discarded.) - Continue taking the remaining pills at the usual time (even if it means taking two pills on the same day).\n- Use back-up contraception (e.g. condoms) or avoid sexual intercourse until hormonal pills have been taken for 7 consecutive days. - If pills were missed in the last week of hormonal pills (e.g. days 15-21 for 28-day pill packs):\n- Omit the hormone-free interval by nishing the hormonal pills in the current pack and starting a new pack the next day. o If unable to start a new pack immediately, use back-up contraception (e.g. condoms) or avoid sexual intercourse until hormonal pills from a new pack have been taken for 7 consecutive days. - Emergency contraception should be considered (with the exception of UPA) if hormonal pills were missed during the rst week and unprotected sexual intercourse occurred in the previous 5 days. - Emergency contraception may also be considered (with the exception of UPA) at other times as appropriate\nNo studies were found on extending the patch-free interval. In studies that provide indirect evidence on the effects of missed combined hormonal contraception on surrogate measures of pregnancy, how differences in surrogate measures correspond to pregnancy risk is unclear (Level of evidence: I, good, indirect to II-3, poor, direct).\n\n【75】 #Vomiting or Severe Diarrhea While Using COCs\nCertain steps should be taken by women who experience vomiting or severe diarrhea while using COCs .\nComments and Evidence Summary. Theoretically, the contraceptive effectiveness of COCs might be decreased because of vomiting or severe diarrhea. Because of the lack of evidence that addresses vomiting or severe diarrhea while using COCs, these recommendations are based on the recommendations for missed COCs. No evidence was found on the effects of vomiting or diarrhea on measures of contraceptive effectiveness including pregnancy, follicular development, hormone levels, or cervical mucus quality.\n\n【76】 #Unscheduled Bleeding with Extended or Continuous Use of Combined Hormonal Contraceptives\n- Before initiation of combined hormonal contraceptives, provide counseling about potential changes in bleeding patterns during extended or continuous combined hormonal contraceptive use. (Extended contraceptive use is defined as a planned hormone-free interval after at least two contiguous cycles. Continuous contraceptive use is defined as uninterrupted use of hormonal contraception without a hormone-free interval) . - Unscheduled spotting or bleeding is common during the first 3-6 months of extended or continuous combined hormonal contraceptive use. It is generally not harmful and decreases with continued combined hormonal contraceptive use. - If clinically indicated, consider an underlying gynecological problem, such as inconsistent use, interactions with other medications, cigarette smoking, an STD, pregnancy, or new pathologic uterine conditions (e.g. polyps or fibroids). If an underlying gynecological problem is found, treat the condition or refer for care. - If an underlying gynecological problem is not found and the woman wants treatment, the following treatment option can be considered:\nDelayed insertion of a new ring or delayed reinsertion of a current ring for <48 hours since a ring should have been inserted\n- Insert ring as soon as possible.\n- Keep the ring in until the scheduled ring removal day.\n- No additional contraceptive protection is needed.\n- Emergency contraception is not usually needed but can be considered (with the exception of UPA) if delayed insertion or reinsertion occurred earlier in the cycle or in the last week of the previous cycle.\n\n【77】 #FIGURE 4. Recommended actions after delayed insertion or reinsertion- with combined vaginal ring\nAbbreviation: UPA = ulipristal acetate. - If removal takes place but the woman is unsure of how long the ring has been removed, consider the ring to have been removed for ≥48 hours since a ring should have been inserted or reinserted.\n-Advise the woman to discontinue combined hormonal contraceptive use (i.e. a hormone-free interval) for 3-4 consecutive days; a hormone-free interval is not recommended during the first 21 days of using the continuous or extended combined hormonal contraceptive method. A hormone-free interval also is not recommended more than once per month because contraceptive effectiveness might be reduced. - If unscheduled spotting or bleeding persists and the woman finds it unacceptable, counsel her on alternative contraceptive methods, and offer another method if it is desired. Comments and Evidence Summary. During contraceptive counseling and before initiating extended or continuous combined hormonal contraceptives, information about common side effects such as unscheduled spotting or bleeding, especially during the first 3-6 months of use, should be discussed . These bleeding irregularities are generally not harmful and usually improve with persistent use of the hormonal method. To avoid unscheduled spotting or bleeding, counseling should emphasize the importance of correct use and timing; for users of contraceptive pills, emphasize consistent pill use. Enhanced counseling about expected bleeding patterns and reassurance that bleeding irregularities are generally not harmful has been shown to reduce method discontinuation in clinical trials with DMPA .\nA systematic review identified three studies with small study populations that addressed treatments for unscheduled bleeding among women using extended or continuous combined hormonal contraceptives . In two separate randomized clinical trials in which women were taking either contraceptive pills or using the contraceptive ring continuously for 168 days, women assigned to a hormone-free interval of 3 or 4 days reported improved bleeding. Although they noted an initial increase in flow, this was followed by an abrupt decrease 7-8 days later with eventual cessation of flow 11-12 days later. These findings were compared with women who continued to use their method without a hormonefree interval, in which a greater proportion reported either treatment failure or fewer days of amenorrhea .\nVomiting or diarrhea (for any reason, for any duration), that occurs within 24 hours after taking a hormonal pill Vomiting or diarrhea, for any reason, continuing for 24 to <48 hours after taking any hormonal pill Vomiting or diarrhea, for any reason, continuing for ≥48 hours after taking any hormonal pill - Taking another hormonal pill (redose) is unnecessary.\n- Continue taking pills daily at the usual time (if possible, despite discomfort). - No additional contraceptive protection is needed. - Emergency contraception is not usually needed but can be considered (with the exception of UPA) as appropriate.\n\n【78】 #Progestin-Only Pills\nPOPs contain only a progestin and no estrogen and are available in the United States. Approximately 9 out of 100 women become pregnant in the first year of use with POPs with typical use . POPs are reversible and can be used by women of all ages. POPs do not protect against STDs; consistent and correct use of male latex condoms reduces the risk for STDs, including HIV.\n\n【79】 #Initiation of POPs Timing\n- POPs can be started at any time if it is reasonably certain that the woman is not pregnant .\n\n【80】 #Need for Back-Up Contraception\n- If POPs are started within the first 5 days since menstrual bleeding started, no additional contraceptive protection is needed. - If POPs are started >5 days since menstrual bleeding started, the woman needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use additional contraceptive protection for the next 2 days.\n\n【81】 #Special Considerations\nAmenorrhea (Not Postpartum)\n- Timing: POPs can be started at any time if it is reasonably certain that the woman is not pregnant . - Need for back-up contraception: The woman needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use additional contraceptive protection for the next 2 days.\n\n【82】 #Postpartum (Breastfeeding)\n- Timing: POPs can be started at any time, including immediately postpartum ,U.S. MEC 2 if 5 days since menstrual bleeding started, she needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use additional contraceptive protection for the next 2 days.\n\n【83】 #Postpartum (Not Breastfeeding)\n- Timing: POPs can be started at any time, including immediately postpartum (U.S. MEC 1), if it is reasonably certain that the woman is not pregnant . - Need for back-up contraception: If a woman is 5 days since menstrual bleeding started, she needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use additional contraceptive protection for the next 2 days.\n\n【84】 #Postabortion (Spontaneous or Induced)\n- Timing: POPs can be started within the first 7 days, including immediately postabortion (U.S. MEC 1). - Need for back-up contraception: The woman needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use additional contraceptive protection for the next 2 days unless POPs are started at the time of a surgical abortion.\n\n【85】 #Switching from Another Contraceptive Method\n- Timing: POPs can be started immediately if it is reasonably certain that the woman is not pregnant . Waiting for her next menstrual cycle is unnecessary. - Need for back-up contraception: If it has been >5 days since menstrual bleeding started, the woman needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use additional contraceptive protection for the next 2 days. - Switching from an IUD: If the woman has had sexual intercourse since the start of her current menstrual cycle and it has been >5 days since menstrual bleeding started, theoretically, residual sperm might be in the genital tract, which could lead to fertilization if ovulation occurs. A health care provider may consider any of the following options: -Advise the women to retain the IUD for at least 2 days after POPs are initiated and return for IUD removal. -Advise the woman to abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier contraception for 7 days before removing the IUD and switching to the new method. -If the woman cannot return for IUD removal and has not abstained from sexual intercourse or used barrier contraception for 7 days, advise the woman to use ECPs at the time of IUD removal. POPs can be started immediately after use of ECPs (with the exception of UPA). POPs can be started no sooner than 5 days after use of UPA. Comments and Evidence Summary. In situations in which the health care provider is uncertain whether the woman might be pregnant, the benefits of starting POPs likely exceed any risk; therefore, starting POPs should be considered at any time, with a follow-up pregnancy test in 2-4 weeks.\nUnlike COCs, POPs inhibit ovulation in about half of cycles, although the rates vary widely by individual . Peak serum steroid levels are reached about 2 hours after administration, followed by rapid distribution and elimination, such that by 24 hours after administration, serum steroid levels are near baseline . Therefore, taking POPs at approximately the same time each day is important. An estimated 48 hours of POP use has been deemed necessary to achieve the contraceptive effects on cervical mucus . If a woman needs to use additional contraceptive protection when switching to POPs from another contraceptive method, consider continuing her previous method for 2 days after starting POPs. No direct evidence was found regarding the effects of starting POPs at different times of the cycle.\n\n【86】 #Examinations and Tests Needed Before Initiation of POPs\nAmong healthy women, no examinations or tests are needed before initiation of POPs, although a baseline weight and BMI measurement might be useful for monitoring POP users over time . Women with known medical problems or other special conditions might need additional examinations or tests before being determined to be appropriate candidates for a particular method of contraception. The U.S. MEC might be useful in such circumstances .\nComments and Evidence Summary. Weight (BMI): Obese women can use POPs (U.S. MEC 1) ; therefore, screening for obesity is not necessary for the safe initiation of POPs. However, measuring weight and calculating BMI at baseline might be helpful for monitoring any changes and counseling women who might be concerned about weight change perceived to be associated with their contraceptive method.\nBimanual examination and cervical inspection: Pelvic examination is not necessary before initiation of POPs because it does not facilitate detection of conditions for which POPs would be unsafe\nLipids: Screening for dyslipidemias is not necessary for the safe initiation of POPs because of the low prevalence of undiagnosed disease in women of reproductive age and the low likelihood of clinically significant changes with use of hormonal contraceptives. A systematic review did not identify any evidence regarding outcomes among women who were screened versus not screened with lipid measurement before initiation of hormonal contraceptives . During 2009-2012 among women aged 20-44 years in the United States, 7.6% had high cholesterol, defined as total serum cholesterol ≥240 mg/dL . During 1999-2008, the prevalence of undiagnosed hypercholesterolemia among women aged 20-44 years was approximately 2% . Studies have shown mixed results about the effects of hormonal methods on lipid levels among both healthy women and women with baseline lipid abnormalities, and the clinical significance of these changes is unclear .\nLiver enzymes: Although women with certain liver diseases generally should not use POPs (U.S. MEC 3) , screening for liver disease before initiation of POPs is not necessary because of the low prevalence of these conditions and the high likelihood that women with liver disease already would - Class A: essential and mandatory in all circumstances for safe and effective use of the contraceptive method. Class B: contributes substantially to safe and effective use, but implementation may be considered within the public health and/or service context; the risk of not performing an examination or test should be balanced against the benefits of making the contraceptive method available. Class C: does not contribute substantially to safe and effective use of the contraceptive method.  Weight (BMI) measurement is not needed to determine medical eligibility for any methods of contraception because all methods can be used (U.S. MEC 1) or generally can be used (U.S. MEC 2) among obese women . However, measuring weight and calculating BMI at baseline might be helpful for monitoring any changes and counseling women who might be concerned about weight change perceived to be associated with their contraceptive method.\nhave had the condition diagnosed. A systematic review did not identify any evidence regarding outcomes among women who were screened versus not screened with liver enzyme tests before initiation of hormonal contraceptives . In 2012, among U.S. women, the percentage with liver disease (not further specified) was 1.3% . In 2013, the incidence of acute hepatitis A, B, or C was ≤1 per 100,000 U.S. population . During 2002-2011, the incidence of liver carcinoma among U.S. women was approximately 3.7 per 100,000 population . Because estrogen and progestins are metabolized in the liver, the use of hormonal contraceptives among women with liver disease might, theoretically, be a concern. The use of hormonal contraceptives, specifically COCs and POPs, does not affect disease progression or severity in women with hepatitis, cirrhosis, or benign focal nodular hyperplasia .\nClinical breast examination: Although women with current breast cancer should not use POPs (U.S. MEC 4) , screening asymptomatic women with a clinical breast examination before initiating POPs is not necessary because of the low prevalence of breast cancer among women of reproductive age. A systematic review did not identify any evidence regarding outcomes among women who were screened versus not screened with a clinical breast examination before initiation of hormonal contraceptives . The incidence of breast cancer among women of reproductive age in the United States is low. In 2012, the incidence of breast cancer among women aged 20-49 years was approximately 70.7 per 100,000 women .\nOther screening: Women with hypertension, diabetes, anemia, thrombogenic mutations, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, cervical cancer, STDs, or HIV infection can use (U.S. MEC 1) or generally can use (U.S. MEC 2) POPs ; therefore, screening for these conditions is not necessary for the safe initiation of POPs.\n\n【87】 #Number of Pill Packs that Should Be Provided at Initial and Return Visits\n- At the initial and return visit, provide or prescribe up to a 1-year supply of POPs (e.g. 13 28-day pill packs), depending on the woman's preferences and anticipated use. - A woman should be able to obtain POPs easily in the amount and at the time she needs them. Comments and Evidence Summary. The more pill packs given up to 13 cycles, the higher the continuation rates. Restricting the number of pill packs distributed or prescribed can result in unwanted discontinuation of the method and increased risk for pregnancy.\nA systematic review of the evidence suggested that providing a greater number of pill packs was associated with increased continuation . Studies that compared provision of one versus 12 packs, one versus 12 or 13 packs, or three versus seven packs found increased continuation of pill use among women provided with more pill packs . However, one study found no difference in continuation when patients were provided one and then three packs versus four packs all at once . In addition to continuation, a greater number of pill packs provided was associated with fewer pregnancy tests, fewer pregnancies, and lower cost per client. However, a greater number of pill packs (13 packs versus three packs) also was associated with increased pill wastage in one study  (Level of evidence: I to II-2, fair, direct).\n\n【88】 #Routine Follow-Up After POP Initiation\nThese recommendations address when routine follow-up is recommended for safe and effective continued use of contraception for healthy women, Specific populations who might benefit from more frequent follow-up visits include adolescents, those with certain medical conditions or characteristics, and those with multiple medical conditions.\n- Advise the woman to return at any time to discuss side effects or other problems or if she wants to change the method being used. No routine follow-up visit is required. - At other routine visits, health care providers seeing POP users should do the following: -Assess the woman's satisfaction with her contraceptive method and whether she has any concerns about method use. -Assess any changes in health status, including medications, that would change the appropriateness of POPs for safe and effective continued use based on U.S. MEC (e.g. category 3 and 4 conditions and characteristics). -Consider assessing weight changes and counseling women who are concerned about weight change perceived to be associated with their contraceptive method. Comments and Evidence Summary. No evidence was found regarding whether a routine follow-up visit after initiating POPs improves correct and continued use.\n\n【89】 #Missed POPs\nFor the following recommendations, a dose is considered missed if it has been >3 hours since it should have been taken.\n- Take one pill as soon as possible.\n- Continue taking pills daily, one each day, at the same time each day, even if it means taking two pills on the same day. - Use back-up contraception (e.g. condoms) or avoid sexual intercourse until pills have been taken correctly, on time, for 2 consecutive days.\n- Emergency contraception should be considered (with the exception of UPA) if the woman has had unprotected sexual intercourse. Comments and Evidence Summary. Inconsistent or incorrect use of oral contraceptive pills is a major reason for oral contraceptive failure. Unlike COCs, POPs inhibit ovulation in about half of cycles, although this rate varies widely by individual . Peak serum steroid levels are reached about 2 hours after administration, followed by rapid distribution and elimination, such that by 24 hours after administration, serum steroid levels are near baseline . Therefore, taking POPs at approximately the same time each day is important. An estimated 48 hours of POP use was deemed necessary to achieve the contraceptive effects on cervical mucus . Women who frequently miss POPs should consider an alternative contraceptive method that is less dependent on the user to be effective (e.g. IUD, implant, or injectable). No evidence was found regarding the effects of missed POPs available in the United States on measures of contraceptive effectiveness including pregnancy, follicular development, hormone levels, or cervical mucus quality.\n\n【90】 #Vomiting or Diarrhea (for any Reason or Duration) that Occurs Within 3 Hours After\nTaking a Pill\n- Take another pill as soon as possible (if possible, despite discomfort). - Continue taking pills daily, one each day, at the same time each day. - Use back-up contraception (e.g. condoms) or avoid sexual intercourse until 2 days after vomiting or diarrhea has resolved. - Emergency contraception should be considered (with the exception of UPA) if the woman has had unprotected sexual intercourse. Comments and Evidence Summary. Theoretically, the contraceptive effectiveness of POPs might be decreased because of vomiting or severe diarrhea. Because of the lack of evidence to address this question, these recommendations are based on the recommendations for missed POPs. No evidence was found regarding the effects of vomiting or diarrhea on measures of contraceptive effectiveness, including pregnancy, follicular development, hormone levels, or cervical mucus quality.\n\n【91】 #Standard Days Method\nSDM is a method based on fertility awareness; users must avoid unprotected sexual intercourse on days 8-19 of the menstrual cycle . Approximately 5 out of 100 women become pregnant in the first year of use with perfect (i.e. correct and consistent) use of SDM ; effectiveness based on typical use is not available for this method but is expected to be lower than that for perfect use. SDM is reversible and can be used by women of all ages. SDM does not protect against STDs; consistent and correct use of male latex condoms reduces the risk for STDs, including HIV.\n\n【92】 #Use of SDM Among Women with Various Durations of the Menstrual Cycle Menstrual Cycles of 26-32 Days\n- The woman may use the method.\n- Provide a barrier method of contraception for protection on days 8-19 if she wants one. - If she has unprotected sexual intercourse during days 8-19, consider the use of emergency contraception if appropriate.\n\n【93】 #Two or More Cycles of 32 Days Within Any 1 Year of SDM Use\n- Advise the woman that the method might not be appropriate for her because of a higher risk for pregnancy. Help her consider another method. Comments and Evidence Summary. The probability of pregnancy is increased when the menstrual cycle is outside the range of 26-32 days, even if unprotected sexual intercourse is avoided on days 8-19. A study of 7,600 menstrual cycles, including information on cycle length and signs of ovulation, concluded that the theoretical effectiveness of SDM is greatest for women with cycles of 26-32 days, that the method is still effective for women who occasionally have a cycle outside this range, and that it is less effective for women who consistently have cycles outside this range. Information from daily hormonal measurements shows that the timing of the 6-day fertile window varies greatly, even among women with regular cycles .\n\n【94】 #Emergency Contraception\nEmergency contraception consists of methods that can be used by women after sexual intercourse to prevent pregnancy. Emergency contraception methods have varying ranges of effectiveness depending on the method and timing of administration. Four options are available in the United States: the Cu-IUD and three types of ECPs.\n\n【95】 #Types of Emergency Contraception Intrauterine Device\n- Cu-IUD\n\n【96】 #ECPs\n- UPA in a single dose (30 mg) - Levonorgestrel in a single dose (1.5 mg) or as a split dose (1 dose of 0.75 mg of levonorgestrel followed by a second dose of 0.75 mg of levonorgestrel 12 hours later) - Combined estrogen and progestin in 2 doses (Yuzpe regimen: 1 dose of 100 µg of ethinyl estradiol plus 0.50 mg of levonorgestrel followed by a second dose of 100 µg of ethinyl estradiol plus 0.50 mg of levonorgestrel 12 hours later)\n\n【97】 #Initiation of Emergency Contraception\nTiming Cu-IUD\n- The Cu-IUD can be inserted within 5 days of the first act of unprotected sexual intercourse as an emergency contraceptive. - In addition, when the day of ovulation can be estimated, the Cu-IUD can be inserted beyond 5 days after sexual intercourse, as long as insertion does not occur >5 days after ovulation.\n\n【98】 #ECPs\n- ECPs should be taken as soon as possible within 5 days of unprotected sexual intercourse. Comments and Evidence Summary. Cu-IUDs are highly effective as emergency contraception  and can be continued as regular contraception. UPA and levonorgestrel ECPs have similar effectiveness when taken within 3 days after unprotected sexual intercourse; however, UPA has been shown to be more effective than the levonorgestrel formulation 3-5 days after unprotected sexual intercourse . The combined estrogen and progestin regimen is less effective than UPA or levonorgestrel and also is associated with more frequent occurrence of side effects (nausea and vomiting) . The levonorgestrel formulation might be less effective than UPA among obese women .\nTwo studies of UPA use found consistent decreases in pregnancy rates when administered within 120 hours of unprotected sexual intercourse .\n\n【99】 #Advance Provision of ECPs\n- An advance supply of ECPs may be provided so that ECPs will be available when needed and can be taken as soon as possible after unprotected sexual intercourse. Comments and Evidence Summary. A systematic review identified 17 studies that reported on safety or effectiveness of advance ECPs in adult or adolescent women . Any use of ECPs was two to seven times greater among women who received an advance supply of ECPs. However, a summary estimate (relative risk = 0.97; 95% confidence interval = 0.77-1.22) of five randomized controlled trials did not indicate a significant reduction in unintended pregnancies at 12 months with advance provision of ECPs. In the majority of studies among adults or adolescents, patterns of regular contraceptive use, pregnancy rates, and incidence of STDs did not vary between those who received advance ECPs and those who did not. Although available evidence supports the safety of advance provision of ECPs, effectiveness of advance provision of ECPs in reducing pregnancy rates at the population level has not been demonstrated (Level of evidence: I to II-3, good to poor, direct).\n\n【100】 #UPA\n- Advise the woman to start or resume hormonal contraception no sooner than 5 days after use of UPA, and provide or prescribe the regular contraceptive method as needed. For methods requiring a visit to a health care provider, such as DMPA, implants, and IUDs, starting the method at the time of UPA use may be considered; the risk that the regular contraceptive method might decrease the effectiveness of UPA must be weighed against the risk of not starting a regular hormonal contraceptive method. - The woman needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier contraception for the next 7 days after starting or resuming regular contraception or until her next menses, whichever comes first. - Any nonhormonal contraceptive method can be started immediately after the use of UPA. - Advise the woman to have a pregnancy test if she does not have a withdrawal bleed within 3 weeks.\n\n【101】 #Levonorgestrel and Combined Estrogen and Progestin ECPs\n- Any regular contraceptive method can be started immediately after the use of levonorgestrel or combined estrogen and progestin ECPs. - The woman needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier contraception for 7 days. - Advise the woman to have a pregnancy test if she does not have a withdrawal bleed within 3 weeks. Comments and Evidence Summary. The resumption or initiation of regular hormonal contraception after ECP use involves consideration of the risk for pregnancy if ECPs fail and the risks for unintended pregnancy if contraception initiation is delayed until the subsequent menstrual cycle. A health care provider may provide or prescribe pills, the patch, or the ring for a woman to start no sooner than 5 days after use of UPA. For methods requiring a visit to a health care provider, such as DMPA, implants, and IUDs, starting the method at the time of UPA use may be considered; the risk that the regular contraceptive method might decrease the effectiveness of UPA must be weighed against the risk of not starting a regular hormonal contraceptive method.\nIn another pharmacodynamic study with a crossover design, women were randomly assigned to one of three groups: 1 UPA followed by desogestrel for 20 days started 1 day later; 2 UPA plus placebo; or 3 placebo plus desogestrel for 20 days . Among women taking UPA followed by desogestrel, a higher incidence of ovulation in the first 5 days was found compared with UPA alone (45% versus 3%, respectively), suggesting desogestrel might decrease the effectiveness of UPA. No concern exists that administering combined estrogen and progestin or levonorgestrel formulations of ECPs concurrently with systemic hormonal contraception decreases the effectiveness of either emergency or regular contraceptive methods because these formulations do not have antiprogestin properties like UPA. If a woman is planning to initiate contraception after the next menstrual bleeding after ECP use, the cycle in which ECPs are used might be shortened, prolonged, or involve unscheduled bleeding.\n\n【102】 #Nausea and Vomiting\n- Levonorgestrel and UPA ECPs cause less nausea and vomiting than combined estrogen and progestin ECPs. - Routine use of antiemetics before taking ECPs is not recommended. Pretreatment with antiemetics may be considered depending on availability and clinical judgment.\n\n【103】 #Vomiting Within 3 Hours of Taking ECPs\n- Another dose of ECP should be taken as soon as possible.\nUse of an antiemetic should be considered. Comments and Evidence Summary. Many women do not experience nausea or vomiting when taking ECPs, and predicting which women will experience nausea or vomiting is difficult. Although routine use of antiemetics before taking ECPs is not recommended, antiemetics are effective in some women and can be offered when appropriate. Health care providers who are deciding whether to offer antiemetics to women taking ECPs should consider the following: 1 women taking combined estrogen and progestin ECPs are more likely to experience nausea and vomiting than those who take levonorgestrel or UPA ECPs; 2 evidence indicates that antiemetics reduce the occurrence of nausea and vomiting in women taking combined estrogen and progestin ECPs; and 3 women who take antiemetics might experience other side effects from the antiemetics.\nA systematic review examined incidence of nausea and vomiting with different ECP regimens and effectiveness of antinausea drugs in reducing nausea and vomiting with ECP use . The levonorgestrel regimen was associated with significantly less nausea than a nonstandard dose of UPA (50 mg) and the standard combined estrogen and progestin regimen . Use of the split-dose levonorgestrel showed no differences in nausea and vomiting compared with the single-dose levonorgestrel . No direct evidence was found regarding the effects of vomiting after taking ECPs.\n\n【104】 #Female Sterilization\nLaparoscopic, abdominal, and hysteroscopic methods of female sterilization are available in the United States, and some of these procedures can be performed in an outpatient procedure or office setting. Fewer than 1 out of 100 women become pregnant in the first year after female sterilization . Because these methods are intended to be irreversible, all women should be appropriately counseled about the permanency of sterilization and the availability of highly effective, long-acting, reversible methods of contraception. Female sterilization does not protect against STDs; consistent and correct use of male latex condoms reduces the risk for STDs, including HIV.\n\n【105】 #When Hysteroscopic Sterilization is\nReliable for Contraception\n- Before a woman can rely on hysteroscopic sterilization for contraception, a hysterosalpingogram (HSG) must be performed 3 months after the sterilization procedure to confirm bilateral tubal occlusion. - The woman should be advised that she needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use additional contraceptive protection until she has confirmed bilateral tubal occlusion.\n\n【106】 #When Laparoscopic and Abdominal Approaches are Reliable for Contraception\n- A woman can rely on sterilization for contraception immediately after laparoscopic and abdominal approaches.\nNo additional contraceptive protection is needed. Comments and Evidence Summary. HSG confirmation is necessary to confirm bilateral tubal occlusion after hysteroscopic sterilization. The inserts for the hysteroscopic sterilization system available in the United States are placed bilaterally into the fallopian tubes and require 3 months for adequate fibrosis and scarring leading to bilateral tubal occlusion. After hysteroscopic sterilization, advise the woman to correctly and consistently use an effective method of contraception while awaiting confirmation. If compliance with another method might be a problem, a woman and her health care provider may consider DMPA injection at the time of sterilization to ensure adequate contraception for 3 months. Unlike laparoscopic and abdominal sterilizations, pregnancy risk beyond 7 years of follow-up has not been studied among women who received hysteroscopic sterilization.\nPregnancy risk with at least 10 years of follow-up has been studied among women who received laparoscopic and abdominal sterilizations .\nA systematic review was conducted to identify studies that reported whether pregnancies occurred after hysteroscopic sterilization . Twenty-four studies were identified that reported whether pregnancies occurred after hysteroscopic sterilization and found that very few pregnancies occurred among women with confirmed bilateral tubal occlusion; however, few studies include long-term follow-up, and none with follow up for >7 years. Among women who had successful bilateral placement, most pregnancies that occurred after hysteroscopic sterilization were in women who did not have confirmed bilateral tubal occlusion at 3 months, either because of lack of follow up or misinterpretation of HSG results . Some pregnancies occurred within 3 months of placement, including among women who were already pregnant at the time of the procedure, women who did not use alternative contraception, or women who had failures of alternative contraception . Although these studies generally demonstrated high rates of bilateral placement, some pregnancies occurred as a result of lack of bilateral placement identified on later imaging ,310,311. Most pregnancies occurred after deviations from FDA directions, which include placement in the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle, imaging at 3 months to document proper placement, and use of effective alternative contraception until documented occlusion (Level of evidence: II-3, fair, direct).\n\n【107】 #Male Sterilization\nMale sterilization, or vasectomy, is one of the few contraceptive methods available to men and can be performed in an outpatient procedure or office setting. Fewer than 1 woman out of 100 becomes pregnant in the first year after her male partner undergoes sterilization . Because male sterilization is intended to be irreversible, all men should be appropriately counseled about the permanency of sterilization and the availability of highly effective, long-acting, reversible methods of contraception for women. Male sterilization does not protect against STDs; consistent and correct use of male latex condoms reduces the risk for STDs, including HIV.\n\n【108】 #When Vasectomy is Reliable for Contraception\n- A semen analysis should be performed 8-16 weeks after a vasectomy to ensure the procedure was successful. - The man should be advised that he should use additional contraceptive protection or abstain from sexual intercourse until he has confirmation of vasectomy success by postvasectomy semen analysis.\n\n【109】 #Other Postprocedure Recommendations\n- The man should refrain from ejaculation for approximately 1 week after the vasectomy to allow for healing of surgical sites and, after certain methods of vasectomy, occlusion of the vas. Comments and Evidence Summary. The Vasectomy Guideline Panel of the American Urological Association performed a systematic review of key issues concerning the practice of vasectomy . All English-language publications on vasectomy published during 1949-2011 were reviewed.\nMotile sperm disappear within a few weeks after vasectomy . The time to azoospermia varies widely in different studies; however, by 12 weeks after the vasectomy, 80% of men have azoospermia, and almost all others have rare nonmotile sperm (defined as ≤100,000 nonmotile sperm per milliliter) . The number of ejaculations after vasectomy is not a reliable indicator of when azoospermia or rare nonmotile sperm will be achieved . Once azoospermia or rare nonmotile sperm has been achieved, patients can rely on the vasectomy for contraception, although not with 100% certainty. The risk for pregnancy after a man has achieved postvasectomy azoospermia is approximately one in 2,000 .\nA median of 78% (range 33%-100%) of men return for a single postvasectomy semen analysis . In the largest cohorts that appear typical of North American vasectomy practice, approximately two thirds of men (55%-71%) return for at least one postvasectomy semen analysis ,322. Assigning men an appointment after their vasectomy might improve compliance with follow-up .\n\n【110】 #When Women Can Stop Using Contraceptives\n- Contraceptive protection is still needed for women aged >44 years if the woman wants to avoid pregnancy. Comments and Evidence Summary. The age at which a woman is no longer at risk for pregnancy is not known. Although uncommon, spontaneous pregnancies occur among women aged >44 years. Both the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the North American Menopause Society recommend that women continue contraceptive use until menopause or age 50-55 years .\nHealth care providers should consider the risks for becoming pregnant in a woman of advanced reproductive age, as well as any risks of continuing contraception until menopause. Pregnancies among women of advanced reproductive age are at higher risk for maternal complications, such as hemorrhage, venous thromboembolism, and death, and fetal complications, such as spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, and congenital anomalies . Risks associated with continuing contraception, in particular risks for acute cardiovascular events (venous thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, or stroke) or breast cancer, also are important to consider. U.S. MEC states that on the basis of age alone, women aged >45 years can use POPs, implants, the LNG-IUD, or the Cu-IUD (U.S. MEC 1) . Women aged >45 years generally can use combined hormonal contraceptives and DMPA (U.S. MEC 2) . However, women in this age group might have chronic conditions or other risk factors that might render use of hormonal contraceptive methods unsafe; U.S. MEC might be helpful in guiding the safe use of contraceptives in these women.\nIn two studies, the incidence of venous thromboembolism was higher among oral contraceptive users aged ≥45 years compared with younger oral contraceptive users ; however, an interaction between hormonal contraception and increased age compared with baseline risk was not demonstrated .\nA pooled analysis by the Collaborative Group on Hormonal Factors and Breast Cancer in 1996  found small increased relative risks for breast cancer among women aged ≥45 years whose last use of combined hormonal contraceptives was <5 years previously and for those whose last use was 5-9 years previously. Seven more recent studies suggested small but nonsignificant increased relative risks for breast carcinoma in situ or breast cancer among women who had used oral contraceptives or DMPA when they were aged ≥40 years compared with those who had never used either method  (Level of evidence: II-2, fair, direct).\n\n【111】 #Conclusion\nMost women can start most contraceptive methods at any time, and few examinations or tests, if any, are needed before starting a contraceptive method. Routine follow-up for most women includes assessment of her satisfaction with the contraceptive method, concerns about method use, and changes in health status or medications that could affect medical eligibility for continued use of the method. Because changes in bleeding patterns are one of the major reasons for discontinuation of contraception, recommendations are provided for the management of bleeding irregularities with various contraceptive methods. In addition, because women and health care providers can be confused about the procedures for missed pills and dosing errors with the contraceptive patch and ring, the instructions are streamlined for easier use. ECPs and emergency use of the Cu-IUD are important options for women, and recommendations on using these methods, as well as starting regular contraception after use of emergency contraception, are provided. Male and female sterilization are highly effective methods of contraception for men, women, and couples who have completed childbearing; for men undergoing vasectomy and women undergoing a hysteroscopic sterilization procedure, additional contraceptive protection is needed until the success of the procedure can be confirmed.\nCDC is committed to working with partners at the federal, national, and local levels to disseminate, implement, and evaluate U.S. SPR recommendations so that the information reaches health care providers. Strategies for dissemination and implementation include collaborating with other federal agencies and professional and service organizations to widely distribute the recommendations through presentations, electronic distribution, newsletters, and other publications; development of provider tools and job aids to assist providers in implementing the new recommendations; and training activities for students, as well as for continuing education. CDC conducts surveys of family planning health care providers to assess attitudes and practices related to contraceptive use. Results from these surveys will assist CDC in evaluating the impact of these recommendations on the provision of contraceptives in the United States. Finally, CDC will continually monitor new scientific evidence and will update these recommendations as warranted by new evidence. Updates to the recommendations, as well as provider tools and other resources, are available on the CDC U.S.\n\n【112】 #Handling Conflict of Interest\nTo promote transparency, all participants were asked to disclose any potential conflicts of interest to CDC prior to the expert meeting and to report any potential conflicts of interest during the introductory portion of the expert meeting. All potential conflicts of interest are listed above. No participants were excluded from discussion based on potential conflicts of interest. One presenter was an employee of a pharmaceutical company and participated by teleconference; after the presentation and questions related to the presentation, the presenter was excused from the discussion. CDC staff who ultimately decided and developed these recommendations have no financial interests or other relationships with the manufacturers of commercial products, suppliers of commercial services, or commercial supporters relevant to these recommendations. for clarifications to the numeric categories, as well as for summaries of the evidence and additional comments. Hormonal contraceptives and intrauterine devices do not protect against sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and women using these methods should be counseled that consistent and correct use of the male latex condom reduces the risk for transmission of HIV and other STDs. Use of female condoms can provide protection from transmission of STDs, although data are limited.\nFor BOX A1. Categories for classifying hormonal contraceptives and intrauterine devices 1 = A condition for which there is no restriction for the use of the contraceptive method. 2 = A condition for which the advantages of using the method generally outweigh the theoretical or proven risks. 3 = A condition for which the theoretical or proven risks usually outweigh the advantages of using the method. 4 = A condition that represents an unacceptable health risk if the contraceptive method is used.  - In instances in which blood pressure cannot be measured by a provider, blood pressure measured in other settings can be reported by the woman to her provider.  Weight (BMI) measurement is not needed to determine medical eligibility for any methods of contraception because all methods can be used (U.S. MEC 1) or generally can be used (U.S. MEC 2) among obese women . However, measuring weight and calculating BMI at baseline might be helpful for monitoring any changes and counseling women who might be concerned about weight change perceived to be associated with their contraceptive method.  A bimanual examination (not cervical inspection) is needed for diaphragm fitting.  Most women do not require additional STD screening at the time of IUD insertion. If a woman with risk factors for STDs has not been screened for gonorrhea and chlamydia according to CDC's STD Treatment Guidelines , screening can be performed at the time of IUD insertion, and insertion should not be delayed. Women with current purulent cervicitis or chlamydial infection or gonococcal infection should not undergo IUD insertion (U.S. MEC 4).\nThe examinations or tests noted apply to women who are presumed to be healthy . Those with known medical problems or other special conditions might need additional examinations or tests before being determined to be appropriate candidates for a particular method of contraception. The 2016 U.S. Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use (U.S. MEC) might be useful in such circumstances . The following classification was considered useful in differentiating the applicability of the various examinations or tests:\n- Class A: essential and mandatory in all circumstances for safe and effective use of the contraceptive method. - Class B: contributes substantially to safe and effective use, but implementation may be considered within the public health and/or service context; risk of not performing an examination or test should be balanced against the benefits of making the contraceptive method available. - Class C: does not contribute substantially to safe and effective use of the contraceptive method.\nNo examinations or tests are needed before initiating condoms or spermicides. A bimanual examination is necessary for diaphragm fitting. A bimanual examination and cervical inspection are needed for cervical cap fitting.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

The collection is connected by a channel to the blood vessel, so blood flows through it. A pseudoaneurysm may rupture and bleed. Pseudoaneurysms differ from true aneurysms in that blood within a true aneurysm is contained by the weakened wall of the blood vessel. The most common cause of a  pseudoaneurysm is femoral artery puncture during cardiac catheterisation. A pseudoaneurysm may also occur after other procedures that involve puncture of an artery, including removal of an arterial blood pressure line or an intra-aortic balloon pump, or after accidental trauma.\nMany pseudoaneurysms resolve spontaneously by thrombosis and need no treatment. If treatment is required, treatment options include compression under ultrasound control, embolisation of the pseudoaneurysm with a variety of materials, or surgical repair.\n\n【4】 #Outline of the procedure\nIn this procedure, thrombin (a blood-clotting agent) is injected under ultrasound guidance into the pseudoaneurysm. This causes thrombosis of the pseudoaneurysm cavity, which seals the arterial puncture site. The resulting clot is gradually reabsorbed.\n\n【5】 #Efficacy\nThree historically controlled studies and one retrospective cohort study were identified comparing thrombin injection with compression. All four studies reported greater success in treating pseudoaneurysms with thrombin injection. In these studies, success rates ranged between 93% (27/29 patients) and 100% (24/24 patients) using thrombin injection, and between 63% (25/40 patients) and 95% (102/107 patients) using compression\nThe Specialist Advisors did not note any concerns regarding the efficacy of this procedure.\n\n【6】 #Safety\nIn the studies identified, the main complications reported were: intra-arterial thrombin injection necessitating thrombectomy for artery occlusion (2%, 3/131 patients); pseudoaneurysm rupture after thrombosis (1%, 1/131 patients); groin abscess (1%, 1/114 patients); leg ischaemia (1%, 1/114 patients); blue toe (1%, 1/114 patients); and buttock pain (1%, 1/114 patients)\nThe Specialist Advisors listed the main potential adverse events of this procedure as thrombosis of the damaged artery and treatment of a clinically infected pseudoaneurysm (because infection can cause late recanalisation and rupture).\nAndrew DillonChief ExecutiveMay 2004\n\n【7】 #\nThe evidence considered by the Interventional Procedures Advisory Committee is described in the following document.\n\n【8】 #Information for patients\nNICE has produced information on this procedure for patients and carers ('Understanding NICE guidance').

{"seq_id": "2361d3bc-c9f0-4acd-ac66-dfa9e48be73a", "title": null, "text": "【0】 Resistant starch\nResistant starch (RS) is starch that escapes digestion in the small intestine of healthy individuals.  Resistant starch is considered the third type of dietary fiber, as it can deliver some of the benefits of insoluble fiber and some of the benefits of soluble fiber.\nSome carbohydrates, such as sugars and most starch, are rapidly digested and absorbed as glucose into the body through the small intestine and subsequently used for short-term energy needs or stored. Resistant starch, on the other hand, resists digestion and passes through to the large intestine where it acts like dietary fiber.\n- RS1 Physically inaccessible or digestible resistant starch, such as that found in seeds or legumes and unprocessed whole grains\n- RS2 Resistant starch that occurs in its natural granular form, such as uncooked potato, green banana flour and high amylose corn\n\n【1】 #As fiber\nResistant starch is one of three types of dietary fiber.\nSoluble Fiber (e.g. pectins, gums, mucillages, and some hemicellulose) – Soluble fiber is found in fresh and dried fruit, vegetables, oats, legumes and seeds.  Some soluble fibers increase viscosity of the intestinal contents and assist in reducing cholesterol absorption. Other soluble fibers are fermented by bacteria within the large intestine and can assist in maintaining colon health and increasing mineral absorption.\nInsoluble Fiber (e.g. cellulose, lignin and hemicellulose) – Insoluble fiber is found in the plant cell walls of whole grain bread, whole grain cereals, fruits, vegetables, unprocessed bran and wheat germ.  Insoluble fiber provides bulking and helps keep people “regular.”  Many insoluble fibers, including cellulose and psyllium, are not fermented.\nResistant Starch – Starch that resists digestion is found in foods such as legumes, bananas (especially under-ripe, slightly green bananas), and unprocessed whole grains.  Natural resistant starch is insoluble, is fermented in the large intestine and is a prebiotic fiber.  Other types of resistant starch may be soluble or insoluble, and may or may not have prebiotic properties.\nExamples of Naturally-Occurring Resistant Starch\nPublic health and scientific experts widely recognize that a significant gap exists between the amount of fiber most of people consume and the optimal amount of fiber for health and wellness. The National Academy of Sciences of the Institute of Medicine within the United States has recommended a daily intake of 38 grams/day for adult men and 25 grams/day for adult women. Many countries around the world recommend 25-30 grams of fiber/day for their populations.  Resistant starch assists in increasing dietary fiber consumption because it can be incorporated into foods without impacting the taste or texture of the food.\n\n【2】 #Health benefits\nMany public health authorities and food organizations such as the Food and Agricultural Organization, the World Health Organization, the British Nutrition Foundation and the U.S. National Academy of Sciences recognize resistant starch as a beneficial carbohydrate.\nSubstantial research of natural resistant starches from high amylose corn indicates benefits in intestinal/colonic health as well as metabolically important benefits in glycemic management and energy. Studies have shown that different classes of resistant starch are digested and/or fermented differently and thus must be considered individually.\n\n【3】 #Weight management\nConsumption of foods containing natural resistant starch positively affects weight management in three ways.\nFiber fortification: When added to foods such as bread, biscuits, sweet goods, pasta, nutritional bars and cereal, resistant starch can increase fiber content without affecting taste or texture. In 2003, the World Health Organization concluded that dietary fiber was the only dietary component that had convincing evidence showing a protective effect against weight gain and obesity.  While the exact mechanisms of fiber protecting against weight gain are still under investigation, its ability to increase satiety and decrease subsequent hunger, along with the altering the secretion of hormones related to food digestion, are considered likely mechanisms.\nCalorie reduction:  Resistant starch lowers the caloric content of foods when it is used to replace flour or other rapidly digested carbohydrates. Natural resistant starch delivers between 2-3 kilocalories/gram (8-12 kilojoules/gram) versus 4 kilocalories/gram (16 kilojoules/gram).\nLipid oxidation:  Resistant starch helps burn fat and may lead to lower fat accumulation. A recent clinical trial with high amylose corn resistant starch showed that it increased fat oxidation after a meal. It also changed the sequence in which the body burns food – with fat burning being placed at the top of the list relative to carbohydrates and protein. These findings suggest a possible metabolic effect of resistant starch that may impact body weight.\n\n【4】 #Energy management\nEating foods with natural resistant starch helps balance energy in the hours following a meal, mitigating a drop in blood sugar.\nResistant starch releases part of its energy in the small intestine as glucose, the exclusive energy source for the brain, and part of its energy in the large intestine as fermentation by-products used as an energy source in muscle and fat tissue.\n\n【5】 #Blood sugar response/glycemic management\nNatural resistant starch helps maintain healthy blood sugar levels by increasing insulin sensitivity in healthy people. Incorporation of resistant starch into processed foods (i.e. as a flour substitute) reduces the glycemic impact of that food and increases insulin sensitivity, which research suggests may help to reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes.\nStudies suggest continual exposure to elevated levels of insulin as a result of a high glycemic diet may contribute to reduced sensitivity by cells to the insulin (insulin resistance) and a higher risk of diabetes. As insulin resistance increases, the body produces more insulin to maintain adequate blood sugar control. With rising resistance, even more insulin is required, and the body may not be able to keep up or the pancreatic cells producing insulin may stop functioning.\nConsumption of natural resistant starch by humans has been shown to result in decreased glycemic response in healthy individuals, decreased glycemic response in diabetics, and increased insulin sensitivity in healthy individuals.\n\n【6】 #Digestive/colonic health\nNatural resistant starch helps maintain a healthy colon and a healthy digestive system via several mechanisms.\nIt helps to keep you \"regular” with a mild laxative effect.\nIt encourages the growth of healthy bacteria in the bowel and discourages the growth of potentially harmful bacteria, called “prebiotic fiber.” The fermentation of natural resistant starch reduces intestinal pH and the production of potentially harmful secondary bile acids, ammonia and phenols.\nIt helps to keep colon tissue healthy by producing protective compounds called short-chain fatty acids.  One of these, called butyrate, is particularly important for colon health because it is the primary energy source for colonic cells and has anti-inflammatory properties that are important for keeping colon cells healthy.  In addition, butyrate has anti-carcinogenic properties.

There is, however, insufficient robust evidence to support the case for routine adoption, particularly on using HumiGard to avoid important adverse outcomes and on how it affects resource use in open and laparoscopic surgery.\n5. Research should report on the comparative rate of surgical site infections and other complications associated with hypothermia and normothermia, as well as related resource use\n\n【3】 #The technology\n\n【4】 #Description of the technology\nHumiGard (Fisher and Paykel Healthcare) is designed to humidify and heat carbon dioxide (CO2) gas, which is routinely used to fill the peritoneal cavity during laparoscopic abdominal surgery. The intention is to reduce the negative effects associated with the use of dry, unwarmed CO2 gas, namely tissue desiccation and intra-operative hypothermia. HumiGard is designed to be used both independently and in addition to other warming measures that are applied to the external body surfaces and extremities, such as forced air warming. HumiGard comprises a humidifier and consumable tubing set. It humidifies and warms the CO2 by passing the gas over a reservoir of water. The heated, humidified gas is then passed along a sterile tube for delivery into the abdominal cavity through a needle cannula. HumiGard can also be applied to open surgical wounds using a bespoke patient interface diffuser to effectively immerse the open surgical wound cavity in warmed, humidified CO2 gas.\nHumiGard received a class IIa CE mark in April 2013. It is indicated for use in laparoscopic or open abdominal surgery when CO2 insufflation gas is used.\nThe list prices (excluding VAT) for the components of HumiGard are as follows.\nCapital costs:\nMR860AEU humidifier: £895.\nConsumables:\nFor laparoscopic surgery: ST310 humidified and heated tubing kit: £75 per patient.\nThe claimed benefits of HumiGard in the case for adoption presented by the company are:\nDecreased incidence of intra-operative and post-operative hypothermia through less evaporative cooling.\nImproved post-operative recovery and faster discharge.\nReduced overall costs as a result of better patient outcomes including fewer surgical site infections, less time spent in hospital for surgery, and less time in post-operative recovery.\n\n【5】 #Current management\nThe NICE guideline on hypothermia recommends that all patients intended for surgery be assessed for risk of perioperative hypothermia. All patients should receive warmed intravenous fluids and blood products; patients identified as being at higher risk should be warmed intraoperatively using a forced air warming device, as should any patient having anaesthesia for more than 30 minutes. Regular temperature measurement is recommended before, during and after surgery, and forced air warming is recommended for any patient whose core temperature drops below 36°C.\nNICE's hypothermia guideline relates to the general prevention of hypothermia during surgery and does not make any specific recommendations about the warming of insufflation gas. Unwarmed, dry insufflation gas is used routinely in laparoscopic surgery.\n\n【6】 #Summary of clinical evidence\nThe key clinical outcomes for HumiGard presented in the decision problem were:\nincidence of hypothermia during and after surgery (defined as a core body temperature of less than 36°C)\nincidence of surgical site infections length of stay in post-operative recovery total length of hospital stay device-related adverse events patient-reported pain.\nThe company carried out separate literature searches for laparoscopic and open surgery, encompassing both published and unpublished studies. Its submission included 24 studies, 20 involving laparoscopic surgery and 4 involving open surgery. The company used a checklist to determine if studies were generalisable and presented 16 .\n\n【7】 ## Laparoscopic surgery\nHermann and De Wilde  reported on a double-blind randomised controlled trial that compared HumiGard with unwarmed, dry CO2 gas in patients aged 18 years or over with benign uterine diseases having gynaecological laparoscopic surgery. Randomisation led to 52 patients receiving warm (35±2°C), humidified (98% humidity) CO2 with HumiGard and 52 patients receiving standard room temperature, dry (0% humidity) CO2. The primary outcome was post-operative pain at 2, 4, 6, 24 and 48 hours as measured by a visual analogue scale (VAS). Secondary outcome measures were morphine consumption and demand and post-operative, patient-controlled analgesia, including rejected boli delivery (not delivered when request was made within 10 minutes of the previous bolus), temperature change during surgery, length of time spent in the recovery room and length of inpatient stay. The results showed a significant difference in total shoulder tip pain (p=0.037), which was one of a number pain outcomes and differences in some indicators of morphine consumption. There were no other statistically significant difference in any of the other outcome measures specified in the scope.\nManwaring et al.  reported on a randomised controlled trial that compared HumiGard with unwarmed, dry CO2 gas in women aged 18 to 55 years having gynaecologic laparoscopic surgery. Randomisation led to 30 patients receiving warmed, humidified CO2 with HumiGard, and 30 patients receiving standard room temperature, dry CO2. The primary outcome was shoulder tip pain at 4 hours after surgery. Secondary outcome measures were time in recovery room, nausea, post-operative temperature and pelvic pain. The results showed a significant difference in change in core temperature from theatre to recovery (p=0.027) but no other statistically significant difference in the other outcome measures specified in the scope.\nSammour et al.  reported a double-blind randomised controlled trial that compared HumiGard with unwarmed, dry CO2 gas in patients aged 15 years or older having elective laparoscopic colonic resection. Randomisation led to 41 patients receiving warm (37°C), humidified (98% humidity) CO2 with HumiGard, and 41 patients receiving room temperature, dry CO2. The primary outcome was total opiate analgesia used during inpatient stay. Secondary outcome measures were post-operative pain (measured on a VAS) at 2, 4, 8 and 12 hours and 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 30 and 60 days after the operation. Other secondary outcome measures were intra-operative core temperature, cytokine response and length of inpatient stay. Six patients in the HumiGard group and 2 in the control group were excluded from the analysis with reasons given. The results showed that HumiGard had a significant effect on post-operative pain at rest on day 1 (p=0.01) and post-operative pain on moving on day 1 (p=0.018). The results showed no statistically significant difference in the other outcome measures specified in the scope.\nMason et al.  was a retrospective cohort trial, done in a single UK centre, including patients having laparoscopic colorectal resections. The trial included 246 consecutive patients (mean age 68 years) with equal numbers having HumiGard or standard care. Outcome measures included incidence of surgical site infections, incidence of post-operative pneumonia, perioperative hypothermia, number of bed days, length of time in theatre recovery and cost. Body temperature was routinely measured tympanically on arrival to the post-anaesthetic recovery suite. The measurement of temperature intraoperatively was not standardised and therefore could not be included in the analysis. The results showed significant differences in perioperative hypothermia (p≤0.001), post-operative hypothermia on arrival in the recovery suite (p<0.001) and incidence of surgical site infections when hypothermic (p=0.02). There was a significant difference in overall incidence of surgical site infections (p=0.04) but not in length of hospital stay.\nThe EAC concluded that the clinical evidence on HumiGard for laparoscopic surgery was of relatively good quality: there are 4 randomised controlled trials and 1 retrospective cohort study in appropriate patients, all of which compared HumiGard with standard unwarmed, dry CO2 gas\n\n【8】 ## Open surgery\nFrey et al.  reported on a randomised controlled trial that compared HumiGard with no insufflation in patients over 18 years (mean age 63.5 years) having elective open colonic surgery. Randomisation led to 42 patients receiving warm (37°C), humidified (100% humidity) CO2 gas with HumiGard and 41 patients receiving no insufflation. The primary outcome was intra-operative core and wound temperature and the secondary outcome measure was length of hospital stay. Two patients in the HumiGard group and 2 in the control group were excluded from the analysis with reasons given. The results showed significant benefits for the HumiGard group in terms of the proportion of patients with core temperature <36.0°C at end of surgery (p=0.005), the proportion of patients with core temperature <36.5°C at end of surgery (p=0.001), reduced core temperature at end of surgery (p≤0.001), reduced core temperature during surgery (p≤0.001), reduced wound area temperature during surgery (p≤0.001) and reduced wound edge temperature during surgery (p≤0.001). The results showed no statistically significant difference between the groups for length of stay.\nWeinberg et al.  reported on a prospective pilot randomised controlled trial published as an abstract that compared HumiGard and standard care (predetermined temperatures for infused fluid, ambient air and heating mattress temperature) with standard care alone in adult patients having primary orthotopic liver transplantation The primary outcome was intra-operative core temperature before reperfusion and at completion of surgery. No secondary outcomes were reported. The core temperature immediately before reperfusion (°C, nasopharyngeal probe) was significantly higher in the HumiGard group (p=0.02). No statistically significant differences were reported for core temperature on wound closure (°C, nasopharyngeal probe), core temperature immediately before reperfusion (°C, pulmonary artery catheter), core temperature on wound closure (°C, pulmonary artery catheter), core temperature immediately before reperfusion (°C, bladder probe) and core temperature on wound closure (°C, bladder probe).\nThe clinical evidence submitted for open surgery was based on 2 small randomised controlled trials, 1 of which was a small pilot study published in abstract form only. The EAC concluded that there was insufficient information to critically appraise the Weinberg et al.  abstract and Frey et al.  was of reasonable quality.\n\n【9】 ## Adverse events\nTwo randomised controlled trials involving laparoscopic abdominal surgery , included device-related adverse events as an outcome measure. Both studies reported no adverse events associated with the use of HumiGard. The other 3 studies on laparoscopic surgery did not report device-related adverse events. None of the studies on open abdominal surgery reported device-related adverse events.\n\n【10】 #Committee considerations\nThe committee noted that there is good evidence that perioperative hypothermia is associated with poor patient outcomes, such as surgical site infections. Experts were in agreement and advised the committee that maintaining perioperative normothermia is now an established aim of clinical practice.\nThe committee heard from the clinical experts that total length of hospital stay after abdominal surgery has been reduced through the implementation of enhanced recovery programmes. Historically, length of stay after colorectal surgery was 7 to 9 days but this has now been reduced to approximately 4 to 5 days through the use of such programmes. This change makes it difficult to demonstrate how a single technology such as HumiGard affects total length of stay but the committee accepted that interventions which reduce surgical site infections would be beneficial.\n\n【11】 #System impact\nDuring abdominal surgery, HumiGard is used in combination with other warming measures (such as forced air warming) in patients at high risk of developing hypothermia. This includes patients having surgical procedures with anaesthesia for more than 30 minutes. During laparoscopic surgery, HumiGard replaces standard insufflation equipment. For open surgery, HumiGard is connected to standard sources of theatre-piped gas. If piped gas is unavailable, the company is able to provide a gas supply stand that delivers CO2 to HumiGard. Clinical experts with experience in the use of HumiGard stated that minimal training is needed to introduce it into clinical practice.\n\n【12】 ## Committee considerations\nThe committee was informed by the clinical experts that HumiGard can be set up in approximately 1 minute.\nThe committee heard from 2 expert advisers that HumiGard has become a well-accepted part of standard theatre practice in their centres. One expert adviser added that HumiGard has been introduced as a part of their enhanced recovery programme and subsequently adopted by every theatre in the hospital.\n\n【13】 #Cost evidence\nThe company identified 2 studies that incorporated a cost-effectiveness analysis. The external assessment centre (EAC) judged that the company's search strategy was highly sensitive and well-constructed, and that the selection criteria reflected the NICE scope. The EAC carried out its own economic search and found no additional studies.\nBoth of the identified studies were published as conference abstracts and compared HumiGard with standard care in the UK. The company provided unpublished, academic-in-confidence draft manuscripts relating to both abstracts.\nThe abstract by Jenks et al.  reported on a cost-utility analysis using a decision analytic model of HumiGard compared with standard care open or laparoscopic colorectal surgery. This showed that HumiGard dominated standard care in both open and laparoscopic surgery  The cost of surgical site infections was derived from the NICE quality standard. The results presented in the full manuscript matched those reported in the abstract.\n\n【14】 ## Cost model\nThe company presented a de novo economic model adapted from Jenks et al. estimating mean cost savings per patient in open and laparoscopic colorectal surgery. The model assumed a 70:30 split for the use of HumiGard in laparoscopic and open surgery respectively. It comprised 2 decision trees incorporating complications associated with hypothermia and related NHS costs for each kind of surgery. The model runs over 1 year; horizons up to 5 years were reported in scenario analyses, but because these extend post-myocardial infarction and stroke costs they affect only open surgery. The model was based on 3 studies: Noor et al. 2015 .\nThe company's base case showed that, overall, HumiGard costs £419 per patient compared with £724 per patient for standard care. The company therefore estimated that using HumiGard would save £305 per patient. Most cost savings (69%) come from fewer surgical site infections after laparoscopic surgery (with cost savings of £20 per patient in open surgery and £428 per patient in laparoscopic surgery).\nSensitivity analyses showed that HumiGard becomes cost incurring when the absolute difference in infection risk is 0.3% .\n\n【15】 ## Additional work by the external assessment centre\nThe EAC re-ran the company's base case and univariate sensitivity analyses for open and laparoscopic surgery separately, and conducted additional analyses using its preferred estimates. The main changes to the company's model were:\n\n【16】 The EAC re-ran univariate sensitivity analyses for open and laparoscopic surgery, including updated costs for adverse events and a discount rate for HumiGard of 3.5% over 5 years. In addition to this for laparoscopic surgery, the EAC took hypothermia data from Sammour et al.  and risk of complications data from Billeter et al, The EAC considered that because stroke and myocardial infarction have long-term resource implications, a longer time horizon was preferable. However, the model incorporates this by simply adding in additional costs to later years, so the EAC also conducted analyses using a 1-year time horizon. Additional EAC sensitivity analyses included an alternative estimate for the cost of treating surgical site infections (£5,164, based on Jenks et al. 2015) and laparoscopic surgery complication data from Noor et al,\nFor open surgery, the results of the EAC's analysis suggest that HumiGard is cost saving compared with standard care, with an average saving per patient of £209. This is a larger cost saving than that identified in the company's model because of the longer (5-year) time horizon. The probability that HumiGard is cost saving was 98% in the sensitivity analysis. The results for a 1-year time horizon were broadly similar to those reported by the company (an average cost saving of £28 per patient).\nThe committee was uncertain about assumptions and parameters in the cost modelling which could not be addressed by the evidence presented. The committee noted that the effect of hypothermia on the risk of stroke during abdominal surgery, the incidence of surgical site infection and the cost of a surgical site infection to the NHS were parameters associated with most uncertainty. The EAC was asked to make further changes to the model to better inform the economic analysis (sections 5.15 to 5.19).\nThe EAC reviewed the NICE guideline on hypothermia to identify additional data on the associated complications. The guideline cited a study by Frank et al6. Nevertheless, following the review, the EAC re-affirmed its view that Billeter et al.  was most relevant to the decision problem.\nFor laparoscopic surgery  suggest that HumiGard is cost saving regardless of the cost of surgical site infections and stroke risk when using a range of complications data from Billeter et al. but cost saving or cost neutral when using only direct data on surgical site infection complications. However, the EAC was unable to fully appraise these models because of incomplete information from Mason et al,\n\n【17】 #Committee considerations\nThe committee was informed by the clinical experts that the 5.5% stroke risk extrapolated from Billeter et al.  in the company's cost model was an overestimate of the risk in current UK NHS practice, and that this is more likely to be less than 1%. The committee concluded that this distinction is likely to be very influential in the outcome of cost modelling. The committee was informed by the EAC that reducing the stroke risk to 0% in the cost model would make the use of HumiGard cost incurring. The committee concluded that the use of HumiGard was unlikely to reduce stroke rates for patients having abdominal surgery in the NHS.\nThe committee concluded that there is good evidence to support the use of measures to prevent hypothermia during abdominal surgery and that, in this regard, HumiGard shows promise. However, it considered that there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate that HumiGard has a substantial effect on reducing adverse outcomes for patients having abdominal surgery.\nThe committee concluded that the cost consequences of using HumiGard in abdominal surgery are very uncertain, and that further research is needed on resource use.\nThe committee recommended conducting research in collaboration with the company and with clinical and academic partners. NICE will update this guidance if new and substantive evidence becomes available.Andrew DillonChief executiveFebruary 2017", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

At 12 months after the start of treatment, people should be reassessed to see whether treatment should continue. Treatment should only continue if there is clear evidence of ongoing clinical benefit. For people in complete remission at 12 months, consider stopping vedolizumab, resuming treatment if there is a relapse. People who continue vedolizumab should be reassessed at least every 12 months to see whether continued treatment is justified\n\n【3】 #The technology\n\n【4】 The NHS list price of vedolizumab is £2050 per 300 mg vial (excluding VAT; 'British national formulary'  edition 69). The company has agreed a patient access scheme with the Department of Health. This scheme provides a simple discount to the list price of vedolizumab, with the discount applied at the point of purchase or invoice. The level of the discount is commercial in confidence. The Department of Health considered that this patient access scheme does not constitute an excessive administrative burden on the NHS\n\n【5】 #The company's submission\n\n【6】 #Clinical effectiveness\nThe company presented evidence from GEMINI I, a study in adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis whose disease had an inadequate response or lost response to immunosuppressants, corticosteroids or TNF‑alpha inhibitors, or who were intolerant to them. It was carried out in 34 countries at 211 centres; 63 centres in the USA and 2 centres in the UK. The study consisted of separate induction and maintenance trials:\nInduction trial (double‑blind cohort): the induction trial included 374 people randomised (3:2) to have double‑blind vedolizumab (300 mg) or placebo, intravenously at weeks 0 and 2, at the same time as conventional therapy. People were assessed for clinical response (the primary outcome) at 6 weeks. Clinical response was measured using the Mayo score, which included assessment of stool frequency, rectal bleeding, an endoscopic assessment and a global assessment by a clinician. Clinical response was defined as a reduction in the Mayo score of at least 3 points and a decrease of at least 30% from baseline, with an accompanying decrease in the rectal bleeding subscore of at least 1 point or an overall rectal bleeding subscore of 1 point or less. Secondary outcomes included clinical remission (Mayo score of up to 2 points and no individual subscore greater than 1 point) and mucosal healing (defined as an endoscopic subscore of 1 point or less).\nInduction (open‑label cohort): an additional 521 people had open‑label vedolizumab (300 mg) at weeks 0 and 2. People were assessed for clinical response (as defined above) at 6 weeks.\nMaintenance trial: people who had taken vedolizumab and had a clinical response at week 6, from either induction cohort, could progress to the maintenance trial. There were 373 people randomised (1:1:1) to have vedolizumab every 8 weeks (n=122), every 4 weeks (n=125), or placebo every 4 weeks (n=126), for up to 52 weeks. The primary outcome for the maintenance trial was clinical remission at week 52 (remission defined as above). Secondary outcome measures included durable clinical response (response at weeks 6 and 52), durable clinical remission (remission at weeks 6 and 52), mucosal healing at week 52 and glucocorticoid‑free remission at week 52 in patients having glucocorticoids at baseline.Additionally, data collection continued for people who did not have a clinical response at 6 weeks in the induction study, and from the induction open‑label cohort. These people continued on their assigned study drug (vedolizumab or placebo) and were followed up until week 52.\nGEMINI I included people who had moderate to severely active ulcerative colitis at baseline (Mayo score of 6 to 12). People in GEMINI I either had disease that had an inadequate response to, or could not tolerate, at least 1 of the following: an immunosuppressant (oral azathioprine or mercaptopurine), a TNF‑alpha inhibitor (infliximab), or a corticosteroid (prednisone) over the previous 5 years. During the trial, people in both treatment arms could take mesalazine, up to 30 mg prednisone (or equivalent daily) and immunosuppressants. People taking corticosteroids had a reduced dose after week 6. Across all study groups, mean age was 40.3 years, mean disease duration was 6.9 years, mean baseline Mayo score was 8.6, mean use of TNF‑alpha inhibitors before study enrolment was 48.2%, and in 41% of people treatment with a TNF‑alpha inhibitor had failed.\nA number of people discontinued treatment before the end of the induction trial: 7 (3%) of those who had vedolizumab and 14 (9%) of those who had placebo. The main reason for discontinuation was lack of efficacy. During the maintenance phase 45 (37%) people having vedolizumab every 8 weeks, 41 (33%) people having vedolizumab every 4 weeks and 78 (62%) people having placebo discontinued prematurely, mostly due to lack of efficacy or disease‑related adverse events.\nThe company presented results for the intention‑to‑treat population, and for subgroups based on previous treatment with TNF‑alpha inhibitors . In the intention‑to‑treat population, 106 (47.1%) people in the vedolizumab arm and 38 (25.5%) people in the placebo arm had a response at week 6 (percentage difference 21.7, 95% confidence interval  11.6 to 31.7, p<0.001). At week 6, 38 (16.9%) people in the vedolizumab arm and 8 (5.4%) in the placebo arm were in remission (percentage difference 11.5, 95% CI 4.7 to 18.3, p=0.001). During the maintenance phase of GEMINI I a similar proportion of people were in remission at week 52 in the 8‑weekly vedolizumab arm and 4‑weekly vedolizumab arm (51  people and 56  people respectively). Statistically significantly fewer people  in the placebo arm were in remission at week 52 (p<0.001) compared with the vedolizumab arms. In total 69 (56.6%) people in the 8‑weekly vedolizumab arm, 65 (52.0%) people in the 4‑weekly vedolizumab arm and 30 (23.8%) people in the placebo arm had a durable clinical response (a clinical response at both week 6 and 52). The p value for the percentage difference between each dosing regimen and placebo was <0.001. Twenty‑five people (20.5%) in the 8‑weekly vedolizumab arm, 30 (24.0%) people in the 4‑weekly vedolizumab arm and 11 (8.7%) people in the placebo arm had durable clinical remission (remission at both week 6 and 52). The p value for the percentage difference between 8‑weekly vedolizumab and placebo was 0.008 and between 4‑weekly vedolizumab and placebo was 0.001.\nThe company presented the results for the 60% of people in the maintenance trial who had not had a TNF‑alpha inhibitor before and for the 32% of people in whom a TNF‑alpha inhibitor had failed. In the population who had not had a TNF‑alpha inhibitor before, 46% of people having 8‑weekly vedolizumab and 19% of people having placebo had clinical remission (percentage difference 26.8, 95% CI 12.4 to 41.2). In the population in whom treatment with a TNF‑alpha inhibitor had failed, 37% of people having 8‑weekly vedolizumab and 5.3% of people having placebo had remission (percentage difference 31.9, 95% CI 10.3 to 51.4).\nHealth‑related quality of life was measured in GEMINI I at week 6 in the induction trial and at weeks 30 and 52 in the maintenance trial using a variety of measures (Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire  total score, the EQ‑5D and the EQ‑5D visual analogue scale  scores and SF‑36). Improvements in quality of life from baseline were greater with vedolizumab than placebo at all time points, across all instruments, in the intention‑to‑treat population.\nThe company carried out a network meta‑analysis to estimate the relative treatment effect and safety of vedolizumab compared with the biological therapies, infliximab, adalimumab and golimumab. The studies used in the meta‑analysis included:\nULTRA 1, ULTRA 2 and Suzuki et al. which compared adalimumab with placebo\nACT 1 and ACT 2, which compared infliximab with placebo\nPURSUIT‑SC/M, which compared golimumab with placebo, and\nGEMINI I, which compared vedolizumab with placebo. The company noted that there were differences between the studies in duration, previous treatment with TNF‑alpha inhibitors and randomisation after the induction phase. The duration of the studies varied between 6 and 8 weeks for the induction phase and between 52 and 54 weeks for the maintenance phase of treatment. The only studies that included people who had previously had TNF‑alpha inhibitors were GEMINI I and ULTRA 2, and the inclusion criteria differed between these studies. GEMINI I included people in whom treatment with infliximab had failed, whereas ULTRA 2 included people whose disease had lost response to, or who could not tolerate another TNF‑alpha inhibitor, before starting adalimumab. The company commented that people in whom prior treatment with a TNF‑alpha inhibitor had failed may be less likely to have a successful response to subsequent treatment than people whose disease had lost response to, or who could not tolerate, a TNF‑alpha inhibitor. Another difference between the trials was how people were randomised after the induction phase. In GEMINI I and PURSUIT‑M, people were re‑randomised if their disease responded to treatment during the induction phase, before entering the maintenance phase of the trial. In all the other trials people were randomised at baseline (before induction treatment) only. They continued to be followed during the maintenance phase in their assigned study arm regardless of whether their disease responded to treatment in the induction phase.\nThe induction phase and maintenance phase data were synthesised separately by the company. The company presented data from a fixed‑effect model for a population who had not previously had a TNF‑alpha inhibitor, a population who had taken a TNF‑alpha inhibitor that had failed, and the whole population (using data from the intention‑to‑treat population in GEMINI I for vedolizumab). The company stated that golimumab and infliximab were not included in the meta‑analysis for the population in whom a TNF‑alpha inhibitor had failed because no data were available for the efficacy of these comparators in this population. The company stated that its primary analyses were the subgroup analyses. This was because the patient populations differed between the studies and the proportion of people who had and had not had previous treatment with TNF‑alpha inhibitors may affect the results.\nThe company presented adverse event data from:\nGEMINI I\nfurther placebo‑controlled clinical trials of vedolizumab in people with Crohn's disease (GEMINI II and III) and interim safety data from a single‑arm extension study evaluating the long‑term safety of vedolizumab, in people with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease, beyond 12 months of treatment.The safety population in GEMINI I was defined as people who had at least 1 dose of the study drug. Drug‑related adverse events across the trials of vedolizumab were similar between people with ulcerative colitis and people with Crohn's disease, with the most common being headache (6%), nasopharyngitis (4%), nausea (4%), arthralgia (4%), upper respiratory infection (3%) and fatigue (3%). The most common serious adverse events in people with ulcerative colitis were worsening of ulcerative colitis and abdominal pain. No cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy were reported across all trials of vedolizumab.\n\n【7】 #Evidence Review Group comments\nThe ERG commented on the baseline characteristics of GEMINI I, and stated that there were no relevant differences between the treatment arms during the induction or maintenance phases. However, there were differences in entry criteria (in the USA failure of an immunomodulator or TNF‑alpha inhibitor was a requirement, whereas elsewhere corticosteroid failure was sufficient for entry), and the protocol for concomitant immunosuppressant use during the study (immunosuppressant use was discontinued at week 6 in the USA but continued elsewhere). The ERG commented that it was unclear how these differences may affect the results of the trial.\nThe ERG commented that the long‑term efficacy and safety of vedolizumab and the optimum duration of therapy remained unclear. This is because, in GEMINI I, people only had vedolizumab for up to 52 weeks, and the extension study to GEMINI I is ongoing. The ERG commented that there are no data on strategies for withdrawal of vedolizumab in people having it to maintain response or remission.\nThe ERG noted that the company had presented data for the subgroups of people in the maintenance trial who had and had not had previous treatment with a TNF‑alpha inhibitor. However, the company had not presented the results for these subgroups for the induction trial. The ERG obtained from the clinical study report for GEMINI I the results for the 55% of people in the induction trial population who had not previously had treatment with a TNF‑alpha inhibitor and the 39% of people in whom treatment with a TNF‑alpha inhibitor had failed. In the population who had not had a TNF‑alpha inhibitor before, 69 (53.1%) people had a clinical response with vedolizumab and 20 (26.3%) people had a clinical response with placebo. In the population in whom treatment with a TNF‑alpha inhibitor had failed, 32 (39%) people had a clinical response with vedolizumab and 13 (20.6%) had a clinical response with placebo. The ERG commented that the results of all subgroup analyses should be interpreted with caution because the numbers of people in each subgroup were small and the study was not powered for these assessments. This included comparing the 4‑weekly and 8‑weekly doses of vedolizumab, and the subgroup analyses relating to prior use of TNF‑alpha inhibitors. The ERG commented that the additional post hoc delayed response analysis should also be interpreted with caution. This was because dosing frequency was increased if a clinical response was not seen by week 6 and the people who continued were not a random sample from the original induction study cohorts.\n\n【8】 #Cost effectiveness\nThe company developed a new model of the induction and the maintenance phases of treatment with vedolizumab and its comparators. A decision tree structure was used to model the induction phase of treatment. The induction phase was assumed to be 6 weeks. The criterion for response was a drop in Mayo score of 3 or more. People whose disease responded remained on their assigned treatment in the maintenance phase. People whose disease did not respond, or who discontinued a biological treatment (vedolizumab, adalimumab, infliximab or golimumab) because of an adverse event were assumed to have conventional therapy in the maintenance phase. The maintenance phase of the model had a Markov structure, similar to that in NICE's technology appraisal guidance on infliximab for subacute manifestations of ulcerative colitis, and a published cost–utility analysis of infliximab compared with conventional therapy. People entered the maintenance phase in one of 3 disease severity health states (defined according to Mayo scores: 'remission' ; 'mild' ; and 'moderate to severe' ), or the 'surgery' health state; depending on response at the end of the induction phase. In addition, the model included health states for, 'post‑surgical remission', 'post‑surgical complications', 'people who had discontinued treatment' and 'death'. The model considered the costs and health benefits from the perspective of the NHS and these were discounted by 3.5% per year over a time horizon of 10 years. The cycle length for the maintenance phase was 8 weeks, which the company stated was likely to be sufficient time for the Mayo scores to be relatively stable.\nThe company's analysis was presented for 3 populations:\nThe whole population, including people who had anti‑TNF inhibitor therapy and those who had not.\nPeople who had not had TNF‑alpha inhibitor therapy.\nPeople in whom TNF‑alpha inhibitor treatment had failed (that is, the disease had not responded to, or had stopped responding to, a TNF‑alpha inhibitor, or the person could not tolerate a TNF‑alpha inhibitor). For all 3 analyses, the comparators included conventional therapies (a combination of aminosalicylates, immunomodulators and corticosteroids) and surgery. TNF‑alpha inhibitors (infliximab, adalimumab and golimumab) were only included as comparators for the subgroup of people who had not had TNF‑alpha inhibitors before. Efficacy data from the intention‑to‑treat population in GEMINI I were used to model the costs and benefits of vedolizumab in the whole population. For the population who had not had TNF‑alpha inhibitors before, data from the company's network meta‑analysis were used. Efficacy data from the population in whom TNF‑alpha inhibitors had failed in GEMINI I were used to model costs and benefits of vedolizumab in this population.\nIn the model it was assumed that response to induction treatment would be assessed at 6 weeks based on when it was assessed in GEMINI I. The company noted that the trials for infliximab and adalimumab measured response at week 8, but for the purposes of the modelling it was assumed that response at week 6 would be equivalent to that seen at week 8. The number of doses people had during the induction phase was also assumed to be the same as in the clinical trials on which the efficacy estimates were based. This meant that people having vedolizumab or golimumab had 2 doses (at weeks 0 and 2), people having adalimumab had 4 doses (at weeks 0, 2, 4 and 6) and people having infliximab had 3 doses (at weeks 0, 2 and 6) during the induction period. The company tested a scenario in which response was assessed at week 10 after 3 doses of vedolizumab. The company stated that this may reflect clinical practice where the decision to continue with treatment is made later . It was assumed that people having vedolizumab or TNF‑alpha inhibitors were treated with conventional therapy at the same time, but at a lower dosage with half the costs than if conventional therapy was their only treatment.\nTo obtain the probability of moving between health states, or remaining in the remission, mild or moderate to severe health states during the maintenance phase, the company used a calibration approach. The company used data from GEMINI I on the proportion of people in remission, or with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis at the end of the induction treatment (6 weeks), and the proportion of people whose disease responded, or were in remission, at the end of the maintenance period (52 weeks) to estimate the probability of moving between the health states during the first year of maintenance treatment. These transition probabilities were assumed to remain constant over time and were applied to each subsequent year in the model. To calculate the estimates and calibrate the model the company applied the following constraints:\nNo more than 99.5% of people would remain in remission in each weekly cycle.\nMore people would remain in the mild health state than enter the moderate to severe health state; more people would remain in the moderate to severe health state than move to the mild health state.\nPeople would not move directly from remission to the moderate to severe health state and vice versa.\nThe sum of the transition probabilities would equal 1.\nDuring the maintenance phase of the model people could die while in any health state at any time. The probability of dying was estimated using age‑ and sex‑specific all‑cause mortality from the UK (Office for National Statistics, 2011). This was adjusted for disease severity, surgery, and post‑surgery remission and complications, to incorporate an increased risk of mortality associated with moderate to severe disease and surgery.\nThe model used the NHS list price for adalimumab; golimumab and infliximab and the discounted patient access scheme price of vedolizumab. The company estimated a weighted average cost of conventional therapy including a combination of aminosalicylates, corticosteroids and immunosuppressants (azathioprine, mercaptopurine and methotrexate). The proportion of each drug used was based on clinical expert opinion. The cost of conventional therapies was based on costs and dosing regimens in the 'British national formulary' (BNF, December 2013) and was £204.80 for 8 weeks of treatment. The company assumed that the costs of conventional therapy would be halved if taken with vedolizumab, adalimumab, infliximab or golimumab rather than if conventional therapies were the only treatment taken by a person.\nThe cost of surgery was assumed to be £13,577.27. The frequency of resource use in each health state was based on a study by Tsai and others. An additional cost of £308 for intravenous infusion was applied to vedolizumab and infliximab at each administration visit (payment by results tariff 2012–13).\nThe company presented deterministic base‑case results for the 3 populations it modelled . The company presented deterministic pairwise comparisons of the incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) for vedolizumab with each comparator separately. It did not present a fully incremental analysis, nor did it present probabilistic ICERs.\nFor the whole population, vedolizumab dominated surgery (it was less costly and more effective). The ICER for vedolizumab compared with conventional therapy was £33,297 per quality‑adjusted life year (QALY) gained.\nIn the population who had not had TNF‑alpha inhibitors before, vedolizumab dominated infliximab, golimumab and surgery. Vedolizumab was associated with an ICER of £6634 per QALY gained when compared with adalimumab, and £4862 per QALY gained when compared with conventional therapy.\naltering the model time horizon (lifetime and 1 year, rather than 10 years)\nusing alternative sources of utility values (in which the utility associated with moderately to severely active disease was lower  than its base‑case estimate )\nexcluding the excess mortality risk for ulcerative colitis using 10‑week response data rather than 6‑week response data and extending the maximum duration of biological treatment from 1 year to 3 years.The model was sensitive to the time horizon, with longer time horizons reducing the ICER in all populations. Using the alternative utility values also reduced the ICER for vedolizumab compared with conventional therapies or the other biological treatments. Increasing the maximum time a person could have biological treatment increased the ICER for vedolizumab in the whole population and in the population who had not had TNF‑alpha inhibitors before. The company noted that, in the base case, all people who had a biological treatment were assumed in the model to switch to conventional therapy after 1 year. Therefore, the long‑term effectiveness of vedolizumab was determined by the effect of vedolizumab treatment over 1 year on the distribution of people across the health states at the end of that year.\nThe ERG considered that it was appropriate to use EQ‑5D data from GEMINI I to determine the utility associated with the disease severity health states in the model. However, the ERG noted that this approach did not differentiate between the treatment that people were having in the trial, and people who did or did not have a response to treatment.\nThe ERG carried out the following exploratory analyses:\nScenario 1: correction of an error in the model in which baseline values for infliximab, rather than conventional therapy, were used in the maintenance model, for people who had not had TNF‑alpha inhibitors and who were having conventional therapy.\nScenario 2: utility values from a study by Woehl et al. were used in the model for each health state ('remission' 0.87; 'mild' 0.76; 'moderate to severe' 0.41; 'surgery' 0.41; 'post‑surgery remission' 0.71; and 'post‑surgery complications' 0.54).\nScenario 4: different assumptions were applied to estimate the transition probabilities between the surgery and post‑surgery health states. It was assumed that:\npeople would not have repeat surgery (because the cost estimates for surgery already included the cost of repeat surgery)\nthe probability of having late complications was based on the probability of chronic pouchitis reported in Arai et al.\nIn scenarios 2 and 3 it was assumed that the utility associated with surgery was the same as having moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. It was also assumed that people with post‑surgery complications would have a utility decrement of 0.17 relative to people in post‑surgery remission, to account for the complications (the 0.17 utility decrement was based on Arseneau et al.).\nIn all scenarios, except for scenario 1, the ERG also assumed a lifetime time horizon rather than a 10‑year time horizon. The corrections in scenario 1 were also applied in all scenarios.\nThe ERG presented fully incremental results for the company's base case and the ERG's scenarios. The effect of these scenarios was as follows:\nIn all scenarios, except scenario 2, vedolizumab was the most effective option (it had the greatest modelled QALYs).\nIn the whole population, the ICER for vedolizumab compared with conventional therapy was £53,084 per QALY gained.\nFollowing consultation on the appraisal consultation document, the company submitted revised cost‑effectiveness estimates for the subgroup of people in whom a TNF‑alpha inhibitor had failed. These estimates were based on a revised patient access scheme, and incorporated all of the ERG suggested revisions to their model  with the exception of the following amendments: scenario 5 (people can continue to have biological therapies beyond 1 year if their disease responds); the transition matrix for rates of surgery was not amended; and the ERG's cost estimate for stoma care was not utilised. The resulting ICERs were £37,086 per QALY gained for vedolizumab compared with conventional therapy using the company's base‑case utility estimates, £27,515 per QALY gained using the Swinburn et al. utility estimates and £30,878 per QALY gained using the Woehl et al. utility estimates.\n\n【9】 #Clinical effectiveness\nThe Committee considered the generalisability of the population in GEMINI I to the population who would have vedolizumab in clinical practice in England. It understood that GEMINI I was an international study and 2 of the centres were in the UK. It was aware that there were differences in the study entry criteria between the USA and other centres. These differences related to which previous treatments had failed and the use of immunosuppressants during the study . The Committee heard from the clinical experts that the population included in the trial broadly reflected the population who would be treated with vedolizumab in England. It also heard that differences in immunosuppressant use between trial centres were unlikely to affect the trial's generalisability to clinical practice in England. The Committee concluded that the clinical efficacy results from GEMINI I were generalisable to clinical practice, but that there was uncertainty about whether the proportion of people who had previous TNF‑alpha inhibitor treatment in GEMINI I would be the same as in the population considered for vedolizumab treatment in England.\n\n【10】 #Cost effectiveness\nThe Committee noted that the company presented base‑case results for 3 populations:\nthe whole population for whom vedolizumab has a marketing authorisation a population who had not had previous treatment with a TNF‑alpha inhibitor a population in whom treatment with a TNF‑alpha inhibitor had failed.The Committee agreed that in view of its previous consideration, it would be useful to consider the 2 subgroups as separate populations  and it should confine its further consideration to whether vedolizumab was cost effective in the 2 subgroups separately, rather than the cost‑effectiveness estimate for the whole population.\nThe Committee considered the original base‑case results (using the company's original patient access scheme) for the population who had not had TNF‑alpha inhibitors before. It noted that there was a large difference in the cost‑effectiveness estimates presented by the company and those presented by the ERG.\nIn the company's base case, the pairwise ICERs for vedolizumab compared with conventional therapy and adalimumab were under £7000 per quality‑adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Vedolizumab was also more effective and less costly than infliximab and golimumab.\n‑year stopping rule\nutility values\nfrequency of surgery and its costs\ncosts of post‑surgery care .\nThe Committee considered the 1‑year stopping rule for biological treatments (vedolizumab, adalimumab, infliximab or golimumab). It noted that the company's model assumed that people would have biological treatments for a maximum of 1 year, after which they would switch to conventional therapy. However, biological treatments continued throughout the first year even if there was a loss of response. The Committee noted that the ERG had considered that biological treatments would continue until there was a loss of response. The Committee was aware that the clinical experts had stated that there was no established stopping rule for vedolizumab or the TNF‑alpha inhibitors when used to treat ulcerative colitis. However, people with confirmed remission may stop treatment if it is likely that their remission will be maintained without continued treatment. The Committee noted that if people stayed on biological treatments for 3 years rather than 1 (as modelled by the company in a scenario analysis) this increased the ICER for vedolizumab compared with drug treatment in the population who had not had TNF‑alpha inhibitors before. Similarly the ERG's scenario, in which people were assumed to continue treatment with biological treatments until loss of response, resulted in an increase in the ICER. The Committee considered that staying on vedolizumab for longer periods of time reduced the likelihood that vedolizumab would be cost effective in the population who had not had a TNF‑alpha inhibitor before. The Committee concluded that a similar stopping rule to that recommended in NICE's technology appraisal guidance on infliximab (review) and adalimumab for the treatment of Crohn's disease was appropriate and was likely to reflect how clinicians would prescribe vedolizumab in clinical practice.\nThe Committee considered whether vedolizumab was an innovative treatment. It noted that vedolizumab has a different mechanism of action to other drug treatment options for ulcerative colitis. It further noted that because vedolizumab suppresses immune activity only in the gut, this was a step‑change in the management of ulcerative colitis because other immunosuppressants affect immune activity in the whole body. The Committee noted that the clinical experts had stated that the benefits of targeted immunosuppression with vedolizumab may not have been fully seen in GEMINI I because some people had vedolizumab plus a systemic immunosuppressant. The Committee concluded that vedolizumab is an innovative technology, and that some of its benefits, such as its targeted immunosuppression, might not be fully captured in the model. The Committee noted that the impact of any such benefits could not be quantified with the available data.\n\n【11】 #Summary of Appraisal Committee's key conclusions\nTA342\nAppraisal title: vedolizumab for treating moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis\n\n【12】 Key conclusion\nThe Committee considered that taking into account the uncertainty of the utility values, and the costs of surgery and post‑surgery care, the incremental cost‑effectiveness ratio (ICER) of vedolizumab for people who had not had tumour necrosis factor‑alpha (TNF‑alpha) inhibitors before was well within the range normally considered to be cost‑effective. It was concerned that the plausible ICERs for people in whom treatment with a TNF‑alpha inhibitor had failed were around the upper limit of the range normally considered to be a cost‑effective use of NHS resources. The Committee recommended vedolizumab, within its marketing authorisation, as an option for treating moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in adults only if the company provides vedolizumab with the discount agreed in the patient access.\nCurrent practice\nClinical need of patients, including the availability of alternative treatments\nThe technology\nProposed benefits of the technology\nHow innovative is the technology in its potential to make a significant and substantial impact on health‑related benefits?\nVedolizumab has a different mechanism of action to other drug treatment options for ulcerative colitis.

However, the Committee was aware that GEMINI I was not powered to test for a statistically significant difference in the treatment effect of vedolizumab between subgroups, that is people who had not had TNF‑alpha inhibitor treatment before, and people in whom TNF‑alpha inhibitors had failed.\nTo compare vedolizumab with the TNF‑alpha inhibitors, the company used a network meta‑analysis. The data available for the network meta‑analysis, relating to the effectiveness of TNF‑alpha inhibitors after TNF‑alpha inhibitor failure was limited to only 1 comparison (with adalimumab).\nRelevance to general clinical practice in the NHS\nUncertainties generated by the evidence\nAre there any clinically relevant subgroups for which there is evidence of differential effectiveness?\nThe Committee heard from the company and the clinical experts that people in whom TNF‑alpha treatment had failed could be considered to have ulcerative colitis that is more difficult to treat.\nEstimate of the size of the clinical effectiveness including strength of supporting evidence\nUncertainties around and plausibility of assumptions and inputs in the economic model\nIncorporation of health‑related quality‑of‑life benefits and utility values\nHave any potential significant and substantial health‑related benefits been identified that were not included in the economic model, and how have they been considered?\nVedolizumab suppresses immune activity only in the gut.

Although physiologic respiration is necessary to sustain cellular respiration and thus life in animals, the processes are distinct: cellular respiration takes place in individual cells of the animal, while physiologic respiration concerns the bulk flow and transport of metabolites between the organism and external environment.\nIn air-breathing vertebrates such as humans, respiration of oxygen includes four stages:\n- Ventilation from the ambient air into the alveoli of the lung.\n- Pulmonary gas exchange from the alveoli into the pulmonary capillaries.\n- Gas transport from the pulmonary capillaries through the circulation to the peripheral capillaries in the organs.\nNote that ventilation and gas transport require energy to power mechanical pumps (the diaphragm and heart respectively), in contrast to the passive diffusion taking place in the gas exchange steps.\nRespiratory physiology is the branch of human physiology concerned with respiration.\n\n【2】 #Classifications of respiration\nThere are several ways to classify the physiology of respiration:\n\n【3】 ## By species\n- Aquatic respiration\n- Buccal pumping\n\n【4】 ## By mechanism\n- Respiration organ\n- Gas exchange\n- Arterial blood gas\n- Control of respiration\n- Apnea\n\n【5】 ## By experiments\n- Huff and puff apparatus\n- Respirometer\n- Selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry\n- Bell jar model lung\n\n【6】 ## By disorders\n- Sudden Infant Death Syndrome\n- Myasthenia gravis - Asthma - Drowning\n- Choking\n- Dyspnea - Anaphylaxis - Pneumonia - Severe acute respiratory syndrome\n- Aspiration (medicine) - Pulmonary edema\n\n【7】 ## By medication\n- Bronchodilator - Asthma medication\n\n【8】 ## By intensive care and emergency medicine\n- CPR\n- Mechanical ventilation\n- Intubation\n- Iron lung\n- Intensive care medicine\n- Liquid breathing\n- ECMO\n- Oxygen toxicity\n- Paramedic\n- Life support\n- General anaesthesia - Bronchoscopy\n- Laryngoscope\n\n【9】 ## By other medical topics\n- Respiratory therapy\n- Breathing gases\n- Hyperbaric oxygen therapy\n- Gas embolism\n- Decompression sickness\n- Barotrauma - Oxygen toxicity\n- Nitrogen narcosis - Carbon dioxide poisoning\n- HPNS\n- Salt water aspiration syndrome", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "2837701e-9d2c-41c5-b5c4-3311b9927c80", "title": null, "text": "【0】 Tongue cancer overview\n\n【1】 #Overview\nTongue cancer must be differentiated from other diseases that cause malignant lesions of the oral cavity and from few non-neoplastic lesions of the oral cavity, such as lymphoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, mucoepidermoid carcinoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, liposarcoma, infections at the floor of mouth and mandible, and normal adenoid tissue for lesions at the base of tongue. In 2009, the incidence of tongue cancer was estimated to be 10,530 cases per 100,000 individuals in the United States. Males are more commonly affected by tongue cancer than females. The incidence of tongue cancer increases with age. The most potent risk factor in the development of oral cancer is alcohol intake, tobacco use and human papillomavirus transmitted through sexual contact. Head and neck MRI scan is diagnostic of tongue cancer. The predominant therapy for tongue cancer is surgical resection. Adjunctive chemotherapy, radiation, chemoradiation, or brachytherapy may be required.\n\n【2】 #Historical perspectives\nHayes Martin was the first to focus on improving cure rates by treating the primary tumor with X-rays. By 1928, V. P. Blair of St Louis was the first to advocate surgery as the best management for oral cancers. A major initiative of the 1970s and 1980s was cytotoxic chemotherapy for patients unfit for surgery.\n\n【3】 #Classification\nThere is no specific established system for the classification of tongue cancer; however, it's classified as part of the oral cancers. Oral cancer can be classified into three types based on the potential to spread to other parts of the body such as malignant tumors,precancerous conditions, and benign tumors. Most common type of malignant tumor of the mouth is squamous cell carcinoma. Squamous cell carcinoma is further classified based on macroscopic and microscopic features. About 5% of oral cavity cancers are rare malignant tumors that start in different types of cells in the oral cavity. These include salivary gland cancer, melanoma, bone and soft tissue sarcomas, Lymphomas and extramedullary plasmacytomas, Hodgkin lymphoma, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma metastatic cancer.\n\n【4】 #Pathophysiology\nTongue cancer constitutes of highly differentiated squamous cells lacking frank cytologic criteria of malignancywith rare mitoses. The surface of the lesion is covered with compressed invaginating folds of keratin layers. A stroma-like inflammatory reaction and a blunt pushing margin may be seen.\n\n【5】 #Causes\nTongue cancer is caused by a point mutation in the tumor suppressor gene (TP53). The other oncogenes associated with oral squamous cell cancers of tongue include c-mycand erb -b1.\n\n【6】 #Differential Diagnosis\nTongue cancer must be differentiated from other diseases that cause malignant lesions of the oral cavity and from non-neoplastic lesions of the oral cavity, such as lymphoma, sarcoma, metastatic tumor, malignant salivary gland tumors, tuberculosis, scarlet fever, syphilis, papilloma, lipoma, leiomyoma, neurofibroma, schwannoma, granular cell tumor, benign migratory glossitis, Hairy tongue, pemphigus, erythema multiforme, mucous membrane pemphigoid, vitamin B deficiency, amyloidosis, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, acromegaly.\n\n【7】 #Epidemiology and Demographics\nIn 2009, the incidence of tongue cancer was estimated to be 10,530 cases per 100,000 individuals in the United States. Males are more commonly affected with tongue cancer than females. The male to female ratio is approximately 2 to 1. The incidence of tongue cancer increases with age; the median age at diagnosis is 61 years. Approximately one-third of all diagnoses occurred in patients under the age of 55. There is no racial predilection to the tongue cancer.\n\n【8】 #Risk Factors\nThe most potent risk factors in the development of oral cancer are alcohol intake, tobacco use and human papillomavirus transmitted through sexual contact. The other risk factors include history of betel quid intake, male gender, age over 55 years, ultraviolet light, Fanconi anemia, dyskeratosis congenita, lichen planus, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), immune system suppression, mouthwash and irritation from dentures.\n\n【9】 #Screening\nAccording to the United States Preventive Services Task Force, screening for tongue cancer is not recommended in the United States. Outside the US, multiple screening programs have been tried in high-risk patients. Screening subjects are tobacco or alcohol consumers.\n\n【10】 #Natural History, Complications and Prognosis\nIf left untreated, patients with tongue cancer may progress to develop metastasis. Common complications of treatment of tongue cancer include neurotoxicity, bleeding, radiation caries, trismus, osteonecrosis, oral mucositis, chronic dysphagia, anemia, pharyngocutaneous fistula, aspiration, infections, xerostomia, taste alterations, nutritional compromise, and abnormal tooth development. Prognosis is generally good, and the five-year mortality rate of patients with stage I and II tongue cancer is approximately 89 and 95 percent respectively. The five- year disease specific survival rate of patients with stage III and IV cancers is 39 and 27 percent respectively.\n\n【11】 #Staging\n\n【12】 #History and Symptoms\nSymptoms of tongue cancer include a red or white patch on the tongue, a sore throat, an ulcer or lump on the tongue, pain on swallowing, speaking, or moving the tongue, numbness in the mouth, bleeding from the tongue, pain in the ear, and pain in the mouth or tongue.\n\n【13】 #Physical Examination\nCommon physical examination findings of tongue cancer include otalgia, submandibular gland asymmetry, and cervical lymphadenopathy.\n\n【14】 #Laboratory Findings\nLaboratory findings consistent with the diagnosis of tongue cancer include reduced CBC levels, abnormal prothrombin time (PT), abnormal activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and abnormal international normalized ratio (INR).\n\n【15】 #Chest X Ray\nThere are no x-ray findings associated with tongue cancer. However, an x-ray may be helpful in the evaluation of metastases to the lungs and mandible.\n\n【16】 #CT\nHead and neck CT scan may be helpful in the diagnosis of tongue cancer. Findings on CT scan suggestive of tongue cancer include soft tissue attenuation of lesions, bony erosions, and increased attenuation of involved nodes.\n\n【17】 #MRI\nHead and neck MRI scan is diagnostic of tongue cancer. On head and neck MRI, tongue cancer is characterized by isointense to hypointense mass on T1-weighted MRI and isotense to hyperintense mass on T2-weighted MRI.\n\n【18】 #Ultrasound\nUltrasound may be performed to detect metastases of tongue cancer to cervical lymph nodes and to aid in FNAC of suspicious nodes.\n\n【19】 #Other Imaging Studies\nThere are no other imaging findings associated with tongue cancer.\n\n【20】 #Other Diagnostic Studies\nPanendoscopy is highly accurate for evaluation of smaller or more superficial second primary mucosal lesions.\n\n【21】 #Medical Therapy\nThe predominant therapy for tongue cancer is surgical resection. It is indicated for patients who have positive resection margins, patients with bone invasion, patients with positive lymph nodes, tumor thickness >4 mm, patients with regional recurrence. For patients who are not surgical candidates but can tolerate chemotherapy, a combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy is appropriate. For patients who are not surgical candidates with bad medical condition and can not tolerate the chemotherapy, radiotherapy without chemotherapy is more appropriate. Chemotherapy is used in patients who present with extensive primary lesions, in patients with distant metastasis or with poor prognosis. Targeted therapy may be used in combination with chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Targeted therapy drugs, such as monoclonal antibodies, interrupt the spread and growth of specific tongue cancer cells.\n\n【22】 #Surgery\nSurgery is the mainstay of treatment for tongue cancer. Radical approach is required in larger lesions, impaired tongue mobility, deep tongue infiltration, floor-of-mouth extension. A partial glossectomy with negative margins can preserve speech and swallowing for most stage I and II lesions of the oral tongue. Partial glossectomy is commonly required for advanced disease.Total glossectomy is required in cases where bilateral lingual arteries are involved by cancer. In these cases, postoperative radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy, appears to improve disease control compared with surgery alone. Elective treatment of the neck in patients with stage I and II oral cavitycancer is not well established. Studies recommend a tumor thickness cutoff of 4 mm as a threshold for elective neck dissection.\n\n【23】 #Primary Prevention\nEffective measures for the primary prevention of tongue cancer include avoiding the use of tobacco and excessive use of alcohol. Main methods for prevention are natural components such as: vitamin A, vitamin E, and beta-carotene because they are rich in trace elements and antioxidants. There is a protective effect of diets rich in fresh fruits and vegetables to reduce the incidence of leukoplakia. There is no effective oral cancer screening program either a general or a selected high-risk population for oral cancer in the United States. Screening high-risk individuals in developing countries could be an effective prevention strategy that lowered the stage of oral cancer at diagnosis and improved 5-year survival.\n\n【24】 #Secondary Prevention\nSecondary prevention strategies following tongue cancer include monthly follow-ups for the first 12-18 months following therapy. Drugs such as synthetic retinoids, non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs, EGFR inhibition, and human papilloma virus related oropharyngeal carcinoma vaccine can be used as a secondary chemopreventiveagents.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

{"seq_id": "1708120e-c213-43cd-8ce8-05efe2433fc4", "title": null, "text": "【0】 Escherichia coli enteritis overview\n\n【1】 #Overview\nE. coli enteritis is an infectious bacterial gastroenteritis caused by a pathogenic strain of the Gram-negative rod, Escherichia coli. It is one of the most common causes of diarrhea worldwide and is responsible for 20% to 50% of all infectious diarrhea, with an incidence in the USA of approximately 20-30 cases per 100,000 individuals. E. coli enteritis may be classified according to the causative E. coli strain into Enterotoxigenic E. coli  (ETEC), Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), Enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC), Enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC), and Enteroaggressive E. coli (EAEC). Transmission of pathogenic E. coli strains is usually by the fecal-oral route in contaminated foods and water. The pathogenesis by which each E. coli strain causes clinical manifestations is unique: ETEC, EHEC, and EAEC secrete toxins, EIEC invades the host colonocytes and migrates within cells, whereas EPEC uses EPEC-elongation factor (EAF) to cause \"attachment and effacing\". Risk factors in the development of E. coli enteritis include young and old age, immunocompromised status, pregnancy, recent ingestion of uncooked or poorly handled vegetables, meat (e.g. hamburgers), poultry, raw milk, or poorly stored foods that require refrigeration (e.g. mayonnaise), drinking from untreated water, recent travel to developing countries, exposure to infected individuals, daycare, and healthcare settings, and recent sexual history of receptive anal or oral-anal contact. Following transmission, the incubation period of pathogenic E. coli strains is approximately 1-10 days, during which the infected patient remains asymptomatic. Early manifestations of E. coli enteritis include diffuse abdominal pain, vomiting, and severe acute watery diarrhea, which may be followed by episodes of bloody diarrhea (in EHEC and EIEC infections). The majority of patients report resolution of symptoms within 5-10 days of symptom-onset. Common complications of E. coli enteritis include hemolytic uremic syndrome (in EHEC infection), thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (in EHEC infection), and acute kidney injury. Prognosis of E. coli enteritis is generally excellent, and the majority of cases resolve without any long-term sequelae. Identification of the causative strain is usually not necessary for diagnosis and treatment. Diagnostic laboratory tests may include either stool culture, ELISA, or polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Rehydration is the mainstay of therapy of E. coli enteritis. Oral rehydration fluids (e.g. oral rehydration solutions) are indicated among patients who can tolerate oral intake, otherwise IV rehydration is indicated. Since the majority of cases of E. coli enteritis are self-limited and the exact infective strain is often not identified, empiric antimicrobial therapy is generally not recommended. Antimicrobial therapy, using either fluoroquinolone or TMP-SMX may be administered (but is not required) in ETEC infection, EPEC infection, and EIEC infection, but not in EHEC infection. Effective preventive measures include hand washing using soap and water and proper food handling.\n\n【2】 #Historical Perspective\nTheodor Escherich, a German physician, was the first to grow cultures of E. coli in 1885. The first pathogenic E. coli strain described was enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC). The infection was reported in 1945 following outbreaks of infant diarrhea in the United Kingdom.\n\n【3】 #Classification\nE. coli enteritis may be classified according to the causative E. coli strain into Enterotoxigenic E. coli  (ETEC), Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), Enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC), Enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC), and Enteroaggressive E. coli (EAEC).\n\n【4】 #Pathophysiology\nE. coli normally colonizes the human gastrointestinal tract shortly following birth. However, the colonizing E.coli strains are different from the pathogenic strains. Transmission of pathogenic E. coli strains is usually by the fecal-oral route via infected food products (e.g. under cooked beef, vegetables, unpasteurized milk products or juice), contaminated water, infected cattle, or human fecal material (e.g. oral-anal contact). Only enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC) has true replication within the host cell, whereas all other types of E. coli replicate outside the host cell. The small intestine is the primary site of action of ETEC and EPEC, whereas the colon is the primary site of action of EHEC and EIEC. EAEC may act on either enterocytes or colonocytes. The pathogenesis, by which each E. coli strain causes manifestations, is unique: ETEC, EHEC, and EAEC secrete toxins, EIEC invades the host colonocytes and migrates within cells, whereas EPEC uses EPEC-elongation factor (EAF) to cause \"attachment and effacing\". Finally, the diffusely adherent E. coli strain (DAEC) is a subtype of EPEC that utilizes unique patterns of adherence.\n\n【5】 #Causes\nE. coli enteritis is caused by pathogenic strains of the bacterium Escherichia coli. E. coli is a non-spore-forming, glucose-fermenting, catalase-positive, lactose-positive, mannitol-positive, oxidase-negative, cellobiose-negative, facultatively anaerobic, Gram-negative rod.\n\n【6】 #Differential Diagnosis\nE. coli enteritis must be differentiated from other causes of abdominal pain, diarrhea, and fever (less common), such as other infectious causes of gastroenteritis, including bacterial, viral, fungal, and parasitic pathogens, in addition to non-infectious causes, including acute pancreatitis, appendicitis, bowel obstruction, diverticulitis, drug reaction, hyperthyroidism, inflammatory bowel disease, mesenteric ischemia, peritonitis, and pneumonia.\n\n【7】 #Epidemiology and Demographics\nE. coli is one of the most common causes of diarrhea worldwide and is responsible for 20% to 50% of all infectious diarrhea. The exact incidence of E. coli enteritis is difficult to estimate, but it is thought that E. coli causes more than 500-700 million cases of enteritis and is responsible for approximately 700,000 deaths each year. In the USA, the incidence of E. coli enteritis is estimated to be approximately 20-30 cases per 100,000 individuals. Young children < 5 years of age and elderly individuals are more commonly affected with E. coli enteritis. There is no gender or racial predilection to the development of E. coli enteritis. E. coli enteritis is more common in developing countries than in developed countries.\n\n【8】 #Risk Factors\nRisk factors in the development of E. coli enteritis include young and old age, immunocompromised status, pregnancy, recent ingestion of uncooked or poorly handled vegetables, meat (e.g. hamburgers), poultry, raw milk, or poorly stored foods that require refrigeration (e.g. mayonnaise), drinking from untreated water, recent travel to developing countries, exposure to infected individuals, daycare, and healthcare settings, and recent sexual history of receptive anal or oral-anal contact.\n\n【9】 #Screening\nScreening asymptomatic individuals for the presence of enteritis-causing E. coli strains is not recommended.\n\n【10】 #Natural History, Complications and Prognosis\nFollowing transmission, the incubation period of pathogenic E. coli strains is approximately 1-10 days, during which the infected patient remains asymptomatic. Early manifestations of E. coli enteritis include diffuse abdominal pain, vomiting, and severe acute watery diarrhea, which may be followed by episodes of bloody diarrhea (in EHEC and EIEC infections). The majority of patients report resolution of symptoms within 5-10 days of symptom-onset. Common complications of E. coli enteritis include hemolytic uremic syndrome (in EHEC infection), thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (in EHEC infections), and acute kidney injury. Prognosis of E. coli enteritis is generally excellent, and the majority of cases resolve without any long-term sequelae.\n\n【11】 ## History and Symptoms\nSymptoms of E. coli enteritis include diarrhea (either watery or bloody), nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and bloating with or without fever (fever is characteristically absent in EHEC enteritis, but may be present in enteritis caused by other E. coli strains). Less common symptoms may be related to complications of E. coli enteritis, such as hemolytic uremic syndrome, and may include spontaneous bruising, oliguria/anuria, and painless gross hematuria.\n\n【12】 ## Physical Examination\nPhysical examination of patients with E. coli enteritis may be remarkable for abdominal tenderness, fever (occasionally), and signs of dehydration, such as abnormal orthostatic vital signs, reduced skin turgor, slow capillary refill, and dry mucous membranes. Physical examination among patients with severe dehydration may be remarkable for altered mental status. Physical examination may also be remarkable for findings suggestive of complications of the E. coli enteritis (e.g. hemolytic uremic syndrome), such as skin pallor, petechiae, and bruises.\n\n【13】 ## Laboratory Findings\nIdentification of the causative strain is usually not necessary for diagnosis and treatment. Diagnostic laboratory tests for E. coli enteritis usually include either stool culture, ELISA, or polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Other laboratory findings in E. coli enteritis are usually non-specific and may include increased white blood cell count and elevated inflammatory markers. Laboratory findings suggestive of dehydration may include relative polycythemia, metabolic alkalosis, elevated BUN and serum creatinine (suggestive of pre-renal acute kidney injury). When hospitalized, patients should also be monitored for laboratory findings that may suggest development of hemolytic uremic syndrome, such as hemolytic anemia, elevated serum creatinine, and thrombocytopenia.\n\n【14】 ## Medical Therapy\nRehydration is the mainstay of therapy of E. coli enteritis. Oral rehydration fluids (e.g. oral rehydration solutions) are indicated among patients who can tolerate oral intake, otherwise IV rehydration is indicated. Since the majority of cases of E. coli enteritis are self-limited and the exact infective strain is often not identified, empiric antimicrobial therapy is generally not recommended. Antimicrobial therapy using either fluoroquinolone or TMP-SMX may be administered (but is not required) in ETEC infection (traveler's diarrhea), EPEC infection, and EIEC infection, but not in EHEC infection (due to increased risk of hemolytic uremic syndrome and prolonged shedding). In adults, additional pharmacologic therapies may include antiemetic agents (not recommended in pediatric patients). Antidiarrheal agents are generally not recommended during the acute infection phase.\n\n【15】 ## Surgery\nSurgery is not recommended to treat E. coli enteritis.\n\n【16】 ## Prevention\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), preventive measures against development of E. coli enteritis include applying proper hand hygiene using soap and water, cooking meat thoroughly (to a temperature of at least 160°F / 70˚C), avoiding consumption of raw and unpasteurized products (e.g. milk, other dairy products, and juices), and avoiding swallowing water when swimming.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Trials have not been conducted to compare either PRRT or 131 I-MIBG with placebo, systemic therapy, tumour debulking treatment, or long-acting somatostatin analogues. Furthermore, no trials have been conducted to make direct comparisons between or among the eight agents reviewed.\n\n【1】 #RECOMMENDATIONS AND KEY EVIDENCE\n\n【2】 - PRRT appears to be an acceptable option in adult patients with neuroendocrine cancer who are inoperable, have residual disease following surgery or other ablative therapy, or have metastases. PRRT is relatively safe and well tolerated with renal protection using lysine and arginine amino acid solution, especially for 90 Y-DOTALAN and 177 Lu-DOTATATE. However, renal function must be monitored. - Treatment with PRRT in Ontario should be conducted as part of one or more RCTs, or in large comparative clinical trials if an RCT is not feasible, under the authority of a Clinical Trials Agreement, to clarify the further effects of PRRT (for example, comparing 177 Lu-DOTATATE with sunitinib in an RCT).\n- 131 I-MIBG may be effective for malignant neuroblastoma, paraganglioma, or pheochromocytoma, but there is insufficient evidence to suggest its efficacy for adult neuroendocrine carcinoma patients. However, the hematologic toxicity, severe infections, and secondary malignancies possible afterwards should be considered.\n\n【3】 #Qualifying Statements\n- There is limited evidence, based on a historical comparison of studies from a single centre , that 177 Lu-DOTATATE may be associated with greater OS, PFS, and overall response rate (defined as the sum of complete response, partial response, and minor response rates) compared with 90 Y-DOTATOC or 111 In-DTPAOC. Therefore, 177 Lu-DOTATATE would be an appropriate agent to include in the future clinical trials described above.\n- Prior to the administration of therapy, the tumours from NET patients who are to receive PRRT or 131 I-MIBG should demonstrate a positive uptake of the related diagnostic agent. - A recommendation cannot be made for or against the use of PRRT in early-stage NET patients, as there is no relevant evidence.\n\n【4】 #Key Evidence\nPeptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy - Fifteen prospective single-arm articles  and one prospective comparative study  met the study selection criteria; of the nine published after 2005, all investigated the effects of 90 Y-DOTATOC, 90 Y-DOTATATE, or 177 Lu-DOTATATE . The total sample size was 1179. All the patient tumours showed a higher or the same uptake on octreoscan than on liver uptake before PRRT. All but one study  reported the overall response rate as determined by three different imaging criteria in a variety of stage III-IV NET subgroups. Across all agents, overall response rates ranged from 5% to 75% in various tumour subgroups, with wide 95% confidence intervals (CI) . - Three studies were conducted in the same clinical centre to investigate the effects of 111 In-DTPAOC, 90 Y-DOTATOC, and 177 Lu-DOTATATE at different time periods .\nThere was no significant difference in OS time between the intervention (14 patients treated with 111 In-DTPAOC and five patients treated with 131 I-MIBG) and control arm in the unique comparative trial . - Of the fifteen articles that reported on toxicity, 11 specified one of two criteria used for grading toxicity. Nausea and vomiting were common during therapy. The severe toxicities included the following: for 111 In-DTPAOC, 8% of patients developed myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and/or leukemia in one study ; for 90 Y-DOTATOC, 0.9% to 3.4% of patients developed grade 4 renal toxicity in three studies , with 2% of patients developing MDS in one study ; for 90 Y-DOTALAN, no severe toxicity was found in one study ; for 90 Y-DOTATATE, 30% of patients developed grade 2 renal toxicity at two years in one study ; and for 177 Lu-DOTATATE, 0.6% of patients developed hepatic insufficiency, 0.8% developed MDS, and 0.4% developed renal insufficiency in one study . For studies investigating the effects of 90 Y-DOTATOC, 90 Y-DOTATATE, and 177 Lu-DOTATATE, lysine and arginine amino acid solution was infused to protect kidney function.\n\n【5】 #I-MIBG Therapy\n- Six prospective single-arm, one retrospective comparative, and one retrospective singlearm study examining the effectiveness of 131 I-MIBG were eligible; the total sample size was 612. All the patients showed at least one lesion as positive on the 123 I-MIBG or 131 I-MIBG scintigraphy. The overall tumour response rate on imaging by various imaging criteria ranged from 32% to 75% for stage III-IV pediatric neuroblastoma patients with a median age of 2.0 to 6.6 years old  and was 26% for adult and stage III-IV NET patients  (including 22 neuroblastomas, 10 pheochromocytomas, three paragangliomas, six medullary thyroid carcinomas, and four carcinoids) and 27% for patients with stage IV paraganglioma or pheochromocytoma  . - The Sywak et al study was the unique comparative study for comparing standard therapies alone with standard therapies plus 131 I-MIBG in stage IV patients with midgut carcinoid . The OS rate was 63% (CI, 47% to 75%) in the intervention group and 47% (CI, 34% to 59%) in the control group at five years, without statistical significance (p=0.10). - Of seven studies reporting on toxicity, three used different criteria, and four studies did not specify the criteria for toxicity grading. Hematologic toxicities were the main severe side effects. Forty-three percent of patients had bone marrow replacement (BMR), and one patient developed secondary leukemia in one study . Five percent of patients in one study  and 2% of patients in another study  developed leukemia or MDS. In a retrospective study, five (4%) three-to five-year-old neuroblastoma patients developed secondary malignancies after 131 I-MIBG therapy either as part of first-line therapy or as salvage therapy for resistant or recurrent disease: one acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia at one and a half years, one chronic myelomonocytic leukemia at four years, one malignant schwannoma at seven years, one rhabdomyosarcoma at 14 years, and one angiomatoid malignant fibrous histiocytoma at 10 years after 131 I-MIBG . In a fifth study, 39% of patients needed autologous BMR, and 9% of patients died  where 131 I-MIBG was utilized as the first-line treatment. Forty-one percent of patients had grade 2-3 hematologic toxicities in a sixth study . After an accumulative dose of at least 63.3 gigabecquerels (GBq) 131 I-MIBG therapy, 4% of patients who did not have prior radiation or chemotherapy developed MDS and acute myeloid leukemia at two and five years, respectively, in the seventh study . In addition, 4% of patients in that same study developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, 4% developed bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia, and 2% had a pulmonary embolism.\n\n【6】 #Treatment Alternatives\nAn RCT has shown somatostatin analogs to be more effective than placebo in the control of tumour growth in patients with metastatic midgut NETs .\nRecently, investigators of two studies have reported positive results in the use of biologic agents for the treatment of malignant pancreatic NETs: one was the tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib, and the other was the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) inhibitor, everolimus .\n\n【7】 #FUTURE RESEARCH\nThe recent publications that report positive results with the biological agents of sunitinib, everolimus, and octreotide long-active release (LAR), particularly with regard to PRRT, raise many important questions that could be the subject of further investigation. Should these drugs be used before, after, or in combination with PRRT? Can these drugs be used alone or in combination with PRRT as adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy (with surgery)? For malignant NET patients with negative uptake on octreoscan or renal insufficiency and positive uptake on 123 I-MIBG scintigraphy, does 131 I-MIBG work well? Furthermore, the use of PRRT early in the treatment of NET patients (i.e. before maximal medical treatment) has not been explored and should be an option for further study in Ontario.\nThe development of a standardized program for the assessment, treatment, and follow-up of NET patients in Ontario is essential to ensure the existence of an appropriate infrastructure for the evaluation of promising new therapies that would provide patients suffering from NETs with high-quality, evidence-based care.\nThe PEBC is a provincial initiative of Cancer Care Ontario supported by the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care through Cancer Care Ontario.

Diluted solutions should not be stored since they contain no preservative.\n- Because heparin disappears rapidly from the circulation, the dose of protamine sulfate required also decreases rapidly with the time elapsed following intravenous injection of heparin.  For example, if the protamine sulfate is administered 30 minutes after the heparin, one-half the usual dose may be sufficient.\n- The dosage of protamine sulfate should be guided by blood coagulation studies.\n- Parenteral drug products should be visually inspected for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.\n\n【4】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\n- There is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Protamine Sulfate in adult patients.\n\n【5】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n- There is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Protamine Sulfate in adult patients.\n\n【6】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Pediatric)\n- There is limited information regarding FDA-Labeled Use of Protamine Sulfate in pediatric patients.\n\n【7】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\n- There is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Protamine Sulfate in pediatric patients.\n\n【8】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n- There is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Protamine Sulfate in pediatric patients.\n\n【9】 #Contraindications\n- Protamine sulfate is contraindicated in patients who have shown previous intolerance to the drug.\n\n【10】 - Hyperheparinemia or bleeding has been reported in experimental animals and in some patients 30 minutes to 18 hours after cardiac surgery (under cardiopulmonary bypass) in spite of complete neutralization of heparin by adequate doses of protamine sulfate at the end of the operation.  It is important to keep the patient under close observation after cardiac surgery.  Additional doses of protamine sulfate should be administered if indicated by coagulation studies, such as the heparin titration test with protamine and the determination of plasma thrombin time.\n- Too-rapid administration of protamine sulfate can cause severe hypotensive and anaphylactoid reactions.\n\n【11】 ## Clinical Trials Experience\n- The intravenous administration of protamine sulfate may cause a sudden fall in blood pressure and bradycardia.  Other reactions include transitory flushing and feeling of warmth, dyspnea, nausea, vomiting and lassitude.  Back pain has been reported in conscious patients undergoing such procedures as cardiac catheterization.\n- Severe adverse reactions have been reported including:  Anaphylaxis that resulted in severe respiratory distress, circulation collapse and capillary leak.  Fatal anaphylaxis has been reported in one patient with no prior history of allergies;  Anaphylactoid reactions with circulatory collapse, capillary leak, and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema; acute pulmonary hypertension.\n- Complement activation by the heparin-protamine complexes, release of lysosomal enzymes from neutrophils, and prostaglandin and thomboxane generation have been associated with the development of anaphylactoid reactions.\n- Severe and potentially irreversible circulatory collapse associated with myocardial failure and reduced cardiac output can also occur.  The mechanism(s) of this reaction and the role played by concurrent factors are unclear.\n- High-protein, noncardiogenic pulmonary edema associated with the use of protamine has been reported in patients on cardiopulmonary bypass who are undergoing cardiovascular surgery.  The etiologic role of protamine in the pathogenesis of this condition is uncertain, and multiple factors have been present in most cases.  The condition has been reported in association with administration of certain blood products, other drugs, cardiopulmonary bypass alone, and other etiologic factors.  It is difficult to treat, and it can be life-threatening.  Because fatal anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions have been reported after the administration of protamine sulfate, the drug should be given only when resuscitation techniques and treatment of anaphyactic and anaphylactoid shock are readily available.\n\n【12】 ## Postmarketing Experience\n- There is limited information regarding Postmarketing Experience of Protamine Sulfate in the drug label.\n\n【13】 #Drug Interactions\n- Protamine sulfate has been shown to be incompatible with certain antibiotics, including several of the cephalosporins and penicillins\n\n【14】 ### Pregnancy\nPregnancy Category (FDA):\n- Pregnancy Category C—Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with protamine sulfate.  It is also not known whether protamine sulfate can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity.  Protamine sulfate should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.\n- Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) Pregnancy Category\nThere is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Protamine Sulfate in women who are pregnant.\n\n【15】 ### Labor and Delivery\nThere is no FDA guidance on use of Protamine Sulfate during labor and delivery.\n\n【16】 ### Nursing Mothers\n- It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk.  Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when protamine sulfate is administered to a nursing woman.\n\n【17】 ### Pediatric Use\n- Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.\n\n【18】 ### Geriatic Use\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Protamine Sulfate with respect to geriatric patients.\n\n【19】 ### Gender\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Protamine Sulfate with respect to specific gender populations.\n\n【20】 ### Race\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Protamine Sulfate with respect to specific racial populations.\n\n【21】 ### Renal Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Protamine Sulfate in patients with renal impairment.\n\n【22】 ### Hepatic Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Protamine Sulfate in patients with hepatic impairment.\n\n【23】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Protamine Sulfate in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n\n【24】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\n- There is no FDA guidance one the use of Protamine Sulfate in patients who are immunocompromised.\n\n【25】 ### Administration\n- Intravenous\n\n【26】 ### Monitoring\n- There is limited information regarding Monitoring of Protamine Sulfate in the drug label.\n\n【27】 #IV Compatibility\nThere is limited information regarding IV Compatibility of Protamine Sulfate in the drug label.\n\n【28】 #Overdosage\nSigns and Symptoms\n- Overdose of protamine sulfate may cause bleeding.  Protamine has a weak anticoagulant effect due to an interaction with platelets and with many proteins including fibrinogen.

{"seq_id": "14a618b0-9878-4e61-a856-a1fcff938605", "title": null, "text": "【0】 Surface tension\nSurface tension is an effect within the surface layer of a liquid that causes that layer to behave as an elastic sheet. In other words, surface tension is all about stretching an object; elasticity. It allows insects, such as the water strider (pond skater, UK), to walk on water. It allows small metal objects such as needles, razor blades, or foil fragments to float on the surface of water, and it is the cause of capillary action. Whenever a raindrop falls, a child splashes in a swimming pool, a cleaning agent is mixed with water, or an alcoholic beverage is stirred in a glass, the effects of surface tension are visible.\nThe physical and chemical behavior of liquids cannot be understood without taking surface tension into account. It governs the shape that small masses of liquid can assume and the degree of contact a liquid can make with another substance.\nApplying Newtonian physics to the forces that arise due to surface tension accurately predicts many liquid behaviors that are so commonplace that most people take them for granted. Applying thermodynamics to those same forces further predicts other more subtle liquid behaviors.\n\n【1】 #The cause\nSurface tension is caused by the attraction between the molecules of the liquid by various intermolecular forces. In the bulk of the liquid each molecule is pulled equally in all directions by neighboring liquid molecules, resulting in a net force of zero. At the surface of the liquid, the molecules are pulled inwards by other molecules deeper inside the liquid and are not attracted as intensely by the molecules in the neighbouring medium (be it vacuum, air or another liquid). Therefore all of the molecules at the surface are subject to an inward force of molecular attraction which can be balanced only by the resistance of the liquid to compression. This inward pull tends to diminish the surface area, and in this respect a liquid surface resembles a stretched elastic membrane. Thus the liquid squeezes itself together until it has the locally lowest surface area possible.\nAnother way to view it is that a molecule in contact with a neighbor is in a lower state of energy than if it weren't in contact with a neighbor. The interior molecules all have as many neighbors as they can possibly have. But the boundary molecules have fewer neighbors than interior molecules and are therefore in a higher state of energy. For the liquid to minimize its energy state, it must minimize its number of boundary molecules and must therefore minimize its surface area.\nAs a result of surface area minimization, a surface will assume the smoothest shape it can (mathematical proof that \"smooth\" shapes minimize surface area relies on use of the Euler-Lagrange Equation). Since any curvature in the surface shape results in greater area, a higher energy will also result. Consequently the surface will push back against any curvature in much the same way as a ball pushed uphill will push back to minimize its gravitational potential energy.\n\n【2】 #Effects in everyday life\nSome examples of the effects of surface tension seen with ordinary water:\n- Beading of rain water on the surface of a waxed automobile. Water adheres weakly to wax and strongly to itself, so water clusters into drops. Surface tension gives them their near-spherical shape, because a sphere has the smallest possible surface area to volume ratio.\n- Formation of drops occurs when a mass of liquid is stretched. The animation shows water adhering to the faucet gaining mass until it is stretched to a point where the surface tension can no longer bind it to the faucet. It then separates and surface tension forms the drop into a sphere. If a stream of water were running from the faucet, the stream would break up into drops during its fall. Gravity stretches the stream, then surface tension pinches it into spheres.\n- Floatation of objects denser than water occurs when the object is nonwettable and its weight is small enough to be born by the forces arising from surface tension.\n- Separation of oil and water is caused by a tension in the surface between dissimilar liquids. This type of surface tension goes by the name \"interface tension\", but its physics is the same.\nSurface tension is visible in other common phenomena, especially when certain substances, surfactants, are used to decrease it:\n- Emulsions are a type of solution in which surface tension plays a role. Tiny fragments of oil suspended in pure water will spontaneously assemble themselves into much larger masses. But the presence of a surfactant provides a decrease in surface tension, which permits stability of minute droplets of oil in the bulk of water (or vice versa).\n\n【3】 ## Two definitions\nSurface tension, represented by the symbol σ, γ or T, is defined as the force along a line of unit length, where the force is parallel to the surface but perpendicular to the line. One way to picture this is to imagine a flat soap film bounded on one side by a taut thread of length, L. The thread will be pulled toward the interior of the film by a force equal to 2γL (the factor of 2 is because the soap film has two sides hence two surfaces). Surface tension is therefore measured in forces per unit length. Its SI unit is newton per metre but the cgs unit of dynes per cm is most commonly used.\nAn equivalent definition, one that is useful in thermodynamics, is work done per unit area. As such, in order to increase the surface area of a mass of liquid by an amount, δA, a quantity of work, γδA, is needed. This work is stored as potential energy\nThe equivalence of measurement of energy per unit area to force per unit length can be proven by dimensional analysis.\n\n【4】 ## Water striders\nThe photograph shows water striders standing on the surface of a pond. It is clearly visible that their feet cause indentations in the water's surface. And it is intuitively evident that the surface with indentations has more surface area than a flat surface. If surface tension tends to minimize surface area, how is it that the water striders are increasing the surface area?\nRecall that what nature really tries to minimize is potential energy. By increasing the surface area of the water, the water striders have increased the potential energy of that surface. But note also that the water striders' center of mass is lower than it would be if they were standing on a flat surface. So their potential energy is decreased. Indeed when you combine the two effects, the net potential energy is minimized. If the water striders depressed the surface any more, the increased surface energy would more than cancel the decreased energy of lowering the insects' center of mass. If they depressed the surface any less, their higher center of mass would more than cancel the reduction in surface energy.\n\n【5】 ## Surface curvature and pressure\nIf no force acts normal to a tensioned surface, the surface must remain flat. But if the pressure on one side of the surface differs from pressure on the other side, the pressure difference times surface area results in a normal force. In order for the surface tension forces to cancel the force due to pressure, the surface must be curved When all the forces are balanced, the resulting equation is known as the Young-Laplace equation:\nwhere:\n- ΔP is the pressure difference.\n- γ is surface tension.\n- Rx and Ry are radii of curvature in each of the axes that are parallel to the surface.\nSolutions to this equation determine the shape of water drops, puddles, menisci, soap bubbles, and all other shapes determined by surface tension (such as the shape of the impressions that a water strider's feet make on the surface of a pond).\nFor not very small drops the effect is subtle, but the pressure difference becomes enormous when the drop sizes approach the molecular size.\n\n【6】 ## Liquid surface as a computer\nTo find the shape of the minimal surface bounded by some arbitrary shaped frame using strictly mathematical means can be a daunting task. Yet by fashioning the frame out of wire and dipping it in soap-solution, an approximately minimal surface (exact in the absence of gravity) will appear in the resulting soap-film within seconds. Without a single calculation, the soap-film arrives at a solution to a complex minimization equation on its own.\nThe reason for this is that the pressure difference across a fluid interface is proportional to the mean curvature, as seen in the Young-Laplace equation. For an open soap film, the pressure difference is zero, hence the mean curvature is zero, and minimal surfaces have the property of zero mean curvature.\n\n【7】 ## Contact angles\nSince no liquid can exist in a perfect vacuum, the surface of any liquid is an interface between that liquid and some other medium. The top surface of a pond, for example, is an interface between the pond water and the air. Surface tension, then, is not a property of the liquid alone, but a property of the liquid's interface with another medium. If a liquid is in a container, then besides the liquid/air interface at its top surface, there is also an interface between the liquid and the walls of the container. The surface tension between the liquid and air is usually different (greater than) its surface tension with the walls of a container. And where the two surfaces meet, their geometry must be such that all forces balance.\nWhere the two surfaces meet, they form a contact angle, \\scriptstyle \\theta, which is the angle the tangent to the surface makes with the solid surface The example on the left  is where the liquid-solid surface tension, \\scriptstyle \\gamma_{\\mathrm{ls}} , is less than the liquid-air surface tension, \\scriptstyle \\gamma_{\\mathrm{la}} , but is nevertheless positive, that is\nThe horizontal component of \\scriptstyle f_\\mathrm{la} is canceled by the adhesive force, \\scriptstyle f_\\mathrm{A}.\nThe more telling balance of forces, though, is in the vertical direction. The vertical component of \\scriptstyle f_\\mathrm{la} must exactly cancel the force, \\scriptstyle f_\\mathrm{ls}.\nSince the forces are in direct proportion to their respective surface tensions, we also have:\nwhere\n- \\scriptstyle \\gamma_\\mathrm{ls} is the liquid-solid surface tension, - \\scriptstyle \\theta is the contact angle, where a concave meniscus has contact angle less than 90° and a convex meniscus has contact angle of greater than 90°.\nThis means that although the liquid-solid surface tension, \\scriptstyle \\gamma_\\mathrm{ls}, is difficult to measure directly, it can be inferred from the easily measured contact angle, \\scriptstyle \\theta, if the liquid-air surface tension, \\scriptstyle \\gamma_\\mathrm{la}, is known.\nBut in this case we see that because the contact angle is less than 90°, the liquid/solid surface tension must be negative:\n\n【8】 ### Special contact angles\nObserve that in the special case of a water-silver interface where the contact angle is equal to 90°, the liquid-solid surface tension is exactly zero. It is difficult to clean the floor if liquids with contact angle ≈ 0°spills, like petrol, kerosene, benzene, etc.\nAnother special case is where the contact angle is exactly 180°. Water with specially prepared Teflon approaches this. Contact angle of 180° occurs when the liquid-solid surface tension is exactly equal to the liquid-air surface tension.\n\n【9】 #Methods of measurement\nBecause surface tension manifests itself in various effects, it offers a number of paths to its measurement. Which method is optimum depends upon the nature of the liquid being measured, the conditions under which its tension is to be measured, and the stability of its surface when it is deformed.\n- Du Noüy Ring method: The traditional method used to measure surface or interfacial tension. Wetting properties of the surface or interface have little influence on this measuring technique. Maximum pull exerted on the ring by the surface is measured.\n- Spinning drop method: This technique is ideal for measuring low interfacial tensions. The diameter of a drop within a heavy phase is measured while both are rotated.\n- Pendant drop method: Surface and interfacial tension can be measured by this technique, even at elevated temperatures and pressures. Geometry of a drop is analyzed optically\n- Bubble pressure method (Jaeger's method): A measurement technique for determining surface tension at short surface ages. Maximum pressure of each bubble is measured.\n- Stalagmometric method: A method of weighting and reading a drop of liquid.\n\n【10】 ## Liquid in a vertical tube\nAn old style mercury barometer consists of a vertical glass tube about 1 cm in diameter partially filled with mercury, and with a vacuum (called Toricelli's vacuum) in the unfilled volume . Notice that the mercury level at the center of the tube is higher than at the edges, making the upper surface of the mercury dome-shaped. The center of mass of the entire column of mercury would be slightly lower if the top surface of the mercury were flat over the entire crossection of the tube. But the dome-shaped top gives slightly less surface area to the entire mass of mercury. Again the two effects combine to minimize the total potential energy. Such a surface shape is known as a convex meniscus.\nThe reason we consider the surface area of the entire mass of mercury, including the part of the surface that is in contact with the glass, is because mercury does not adhere at all to glass. So the surface tension of the mercury acts over its entire surface area, including where it is in contact with the glass. If instead of glass, the tube were made out of copper, the situation would be very different. Mercury aggressively adheres to copper. So in a copper tube, the level of mercury at the center of the tube will be lower rather than higher than at the edges (that is, it would be a concave meniscus). In a situation where the liquid adheres to the walls of its container, we consider the part of the fluid's surface area that is in contact with the container to have negative surface tension. The fluid then works to maximize the contact surface area. So in this case increasing the area in contact with the container decreases rather than increases the potential energy. That decrease is enough to compensate for the increased potential energy associated with lifting the fluid near the walls of the container.\nIf a tube is sufficiently narrow and the liquid adhesion to its walls is sufficiently strong, surface tension can draw liquid up the tube in a phenomenon known as capillary action. The height the column is lifted to is given by:\nwhere\n- \\scriptstyle h is the height the liquid is lifted, - \\scriptstyle \\theta is the angle of contact described above. Note that if \\scriptstyle \\theta is greater than 90°, as with mercury in a glass container, the liquid will be depressed rather than lifted.\n\n【11】 ## Puddles on a surface\nPouring mercury onto a horizontal flat sheet of glass results in a puddle that has a perceptible thickness (do not try this except under a fume hood. Mercury vapor is a toxic hazard). The puddle will spread out only to the point where it is a little under half a centimeter thick, and no thinner. Again this is due to the action of mercury's strong surface tension. The liquid mass flattens out because that brings as much of the mercury to as low a level as possible. But the surface tension, at the same time, is acting to reduce the total surface area. The result is the compromise of a puddle of a nearly fixed thickness.\nThe same surface tension demonstration can be done with water, but only on a surface made of a substance that the water does not adhere to. Wax is such a substance. Water poured onto a smooth, flat, horizontal wax surface, say a waxed sheet of glass, will behave similarly to the mercury poured onto glass.\nThe thickness of a puddle of liquid on a surface whose contact angle is 180° is given by:\nwhere\nIn reality, the thicknesses of the puddles will be slightly less than what is predicted by the above formula because very few surfaces have a contact angle of 180° with any liquid. When the contact angle is less than 180°, the thickness is given by:\nFor mercury on glass, \\scriptstyle \\gamma_\\mathrm{Hg}\\ =\\ 487\\ \\mathrm{\\frac{dyn}{cm}}, \\scriptstyle \\rho_\\mathrm{Hg}\\ =\\ 13.5\\ \\mathrm{\\frac{g}{cm^3}}, and \\scriptstyle \\theta = 140^\\circ, which gives \\scriptstyle h_\\mathrm{Hg}\\ =\\ 0.36\\ \\mathrm{cm}. For water on paraffin at 25 °C, \\scriptstyle \\gamma_\\mathrm{H_2O}\\ =\\ 72\\ \\mathrm{\\frac{dyn}{cm}}, \\scriptstyle \\rho_\\mathrm{H_2O}\\ = 1.0\\ \\mathrm{\\frac{g}{cm^3}}, and \\scriptstyle \\theta = 107^\\circ which gives\nscriptstyle h_\\mathrm{H_2O}\\ =\\ 0.49\\ \\mathrm{cm}.\nThe formula also predicts that when the contact angle is 0°, the liquid will spread out into a micro-thin layer over the surface. Such a surface is said to be fully wettable by the liquid.\n\n【12】 ## The break up of streams into drops\nIn day to day life we all observe that a stream of water emerging from a faucet will break up into droplets, no matter how smoothly the stream is emitted from the faucet. This is due to a phenomenon called the Plateau-Rayleigh instability, which is entirely a consequence of the effects of surface tension.\nThe explanation of this instability begins with the existence of tiny perturbations in the stream. These are always present, no matter how smooth the stream is. If the perturbations are resolved into sinusoidal components, we find that some components grow with time while others decay with time. Among those that grow with time, some grow at faster rates than others. Whether a component decays or grows, and how fast it grows is entirely a function of its wave number (a measure of how many peaks and troughs per centimeter) and the radius of the original cylindrical stream\nBy assuming that all possible components exist initially in roughly equal (but minuscule) amplitudes, the size of the final drops can be predicted by determining by wave number which component grows the fastest. As time progresses, it is the component whose growth rate is maximum that will come to dominate and will eventually be the one that pinches the stream into drops.\nObserve the two bands shown girdling the stream – one at a peak and the other at a trough of the wave. At the trough, the radius of the stream is smaller, hence according to the Young-Laplace equation (discussed above) the pressure due to surface tension is increased. Likewise at the peak the radius of the stream is greater and, by the same reasoning, pressure due to surface tension is reduced. If this were the only effect, we would expect that the higher pressure in the trough would squeeze liquid into the lower pressure region in the peak. In this way we see how the wave grows in amplitude over time.\nBut the Young-Laplace equation is influenced by two separate radius components. In this case one is the radius, already discussed, of the stream itself. The other is the radius of curvature of the wave itself Observe that the radius of curvature at the trough is, in fact, negative, meaning that, according to Young-Laplace, it actually decreases the pressure in the trough. Likewise the radius of curvature at the peak is positive and increases the pressure in that region. The effect of these components is opposite the effects of the radius of the stream itself.\nWhen all the math is done, it is found that unstable components (that is, components that grow over time) are only those where the product of the wave number with the initial radius is less than unity (\\scriptstyle kR_0 \\ ). The component that grows the fastest is the one whose wave number satisfies the equation:\n\n【13】 #Thermodynamics\nAs stated above, the mechanical work needed to increase a surface is \\scriptstyle dW \\ = \\ \\gamma dA. Hence at constant temperature and pressure, surface tension equals Gibbs free energy per surface area:\nwhere \\scriptstyle G is Gibbs free energy and \\scriptstyle A is the area.\nThermodynamics requires that all spontaneous changes of state are accompanied by a decrease in Gibbs free energy.\nFrom this it is easy to understand why decreasing the surface area of a mass of liquid is always spontaneous (\\scriptstyle \\Delta G \\ ), provided it is not coupled to any other energy changes. It follows that in order to increase surface area, a certain amount of energy must be added.\nGibbs free energy is defined by the equation, \\scriptstyle G \\ = \\ H \\ - \\ TS, where \\scriptstyle H is enthalpy and \\scriptstyle S is entropy. Based upon this and the fact that surface tension is Gibbs free energy per unit area, it is possible to obtain the following expression for entropy per unit area:\nKelvin's Equation for surfaces arises by rearranging the previous equations. It states that surface enthalpy or surface energy (different from surface free energy) depends both on surface tension and its derivative with temperature at constant pressure by the relationship.\n\n【14】 ### Influence of temperature\nSurface tension is dependent on temperature. For that reason, when a value is given for the surface tension of an interface, temperature must be explicitly stated. The general trend is that surface tension decreases with the increase of temperature, reaching a value of 0 at the critical temperature There are only empirical equations to relate surface tension and temperature:\n- Eötvös:\n- \\scriptstyle V is the molar volume of that substance\nFor example for water k = 1.03 erg/°C (103 nJ/K), V = 18 ml/mol and TC = 374 °C.\nA variant on Eötvös is described by Ramay and Shields:\nwhere the temperature offset of 6 kelvins provides the formula with a better fit to reality at lower temperatures.\n- Guggenheim-Katayama:\nscriptstyle \\gamma^o is a constant for each liquid and n is an empirical factor, whose value is 11/9 for organic liquids. This equation was also proposed by van der Waals, who further proposed that \\scriptstyle \\gamma^0 could be given by the expression, \\scriptstyle K_2 T^{\\frac {1}{3}}_c P^{\\frac {2}{3}}_c, where \\scriptstyle K_2 is a universal constant for all liquids, and \\scriptstyle P_c is the critical pressure of the liquid (although later experiments found \\scriptstyle K_2 to vary to some degree from one liquid to another).\nBoth Guggenheim-Katayama and Eötvös take into account the fact that surface tension reaches 0 at the critical temperature, whereas Ramay and Shields fails to match reality at this endpoint.\n\n【15】 ### Influence of solute concentration\nSolutes can have different effects on surface tension depending on their structure:\n- No effect, for example sugar\n- Increase of surface tension, inorganic salts\n- Decrease surface tension progressively, alcohols\nWhat complicates the effect is that a solute can exist in a different concentration at the surface of a solvent than in its bulk. This difference varies from one solute/solvent combination to another.\nGibbs isotherm states that: \\Gamma\\ =\\ - \\frac{1}{RT} \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\gamma}{\\partial \\ln C} \\right)_{T,P}\n- \\scriptstyle  \\Gamma is known as surface concentration, it represents excess of solute per unit area of the surface over what would be present if the bulk concentration prevailed all the way to the surface. It has units of mol/m2\n- \\scriptstyle C is the concentration of the substance in the bulk solution.\nCertain assumptions are taken in its deduction, therefore Gibbs isotherm can only be applied to ideal (very dilute) solutions with two components.\n\n【16】 ### Influence of particle size on vapour pressure\nThe Clausius-Clapeyron relation leads to another equation also attributed to Kelvin. It explains why, because of surface tension, the vapor pressure for small droplets of liquid in suspension is greater than standard vapor pressure of that same liquid when the interface is flat. That is to say that when a liquid is forming small droplets, the equilibrium concentration of its vapor in its surroundings is greater. This arises because the pressure inside the droplet is greater than outside.\n- \\scriptstyle P_v^o is the standard vapor pressure for that liquid at that temperature and pressure.\n- \\scriptstyle V is the molar volume.\nr_k is the Kelvin radius, the radius of the droplets.\nThe effect explains supersaturation of vapors. In the absence of nucleation sites, tiny droplets must form before they can evolve into larger droplets. This requires a vapor pressure many times the vapor pressure at the phase transition point.\nThis equation is also used in catalyst chemistry to assess mesoporosity for solids.\nThe effect can be viewed in terms of the average number of molecular neighbors of surface molecules .\n\n【17】 #Gallery of effects\n- Breakup of a moving sheet of water bouncing off of a spoon.\n- Photo of flowing water adhering to a hand.

The pathogenesis of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is largely attributable to the decrease in T-lymphocytes that bear the CD4 receptor . Progressive depletion of CD4+ T-lymphocytes is associated with an increased likelihood of clinical complications .\nMost laboratories measure absolute CD4+ T-cell levels in whole blood by a multiplatform, three-stage process. The CD4+ T-cell number is the product of three laboratory techniques: the white blood cell (WBC) count; the percentage of WBCs that are lymphocytes (differential); and the percentage of lymphocytes that are CD4+ T-cells. The last stage in the process of measuring the percentage of CD4+ Tlymphocytes in the whole-blood sample is referred to as \"immunophenotyping by flow cytometry\" . Immunophenotyping refers to the detection of antigenic determinants (which are unique to particular cell types) on the surface of WBCs using antigen-specific monoclonal antibodies that have been labeled with a fluorescent dye or fluorochrome (e.g. phycoerythrin  or fluorescein isothiocyanate ). The fluorochrome-labeled cells are analyzed by using a flow cytometer, which categorizes individual cells according to size, granularity, fluorochrome, and intensity of fluorescence. Size and granularity, detected by light scattering, characterize the types of WBCs (i.e. granulocytes, monocytes, and lymphocytes). Fluorochrome-labeled antibodies distinguish populations and subpopulations of WBCs. Although flow cytometric immunophenotyping is a highly complex technology, methodology for performing CD4+ T-cell determinations has become more standardized between laboratories. The publication of several sets of guidelines addressing aspects of the CD4+ T-lymphocyte testing process (e.g. quality control, quality assurance, and reagents for flow cytometric immunophenotyping of lymphocytes) has contributed to this standardization .\nThe CDC guidelines concerning CD4+ T-cell determinations  were first published in the MMWR in 1992 to provide laboratorians with the most complete information about how to measure CD4+ T-lymphocytes in blood from HIV-infected persons by using flow cytometry. These guidelines were based on data from scientific literature, information from discussions with technical experts, and experience with related voluntary standards for flow cytometric analyses  In 1993, a national conference was convened by CDC with sponsorship from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), National Institutes of Health, and Association of State and Territorial Public Health Laboratory Directors. The objectives of the conference were to review data collected after 1992 and to obtain input about the efficacy of the 1992 guidelines. As a result of the 1993 conference, the revised guidelines for performing CD4+ T-cell determinations in HIV-infected persons were published in 1994 .\nSince 1994, the field of CD4+ T-cell testing has rapidly expanded. Flow cytometric analyses of T-cell subsets using three-and four-color approaches (in contrast to the two-color approach addressed in previous reports ), flow cytometric analyses for measuring both the proportion and the absolute numbers of CD4+ T-lymphocytes, and other methods for deriving an absolute CD4+ T-cell count in a blood sample are now commercially available. (Some of these other methods do not depend on the multi-stage process and are collectively referred to in this report as single-platform methods.) Moreover, data evaluating some of the parameters of two-color flow cytometric testing and the routine testing practices of laboratories that provide these testing services have been collected. A second national conference on CD4+ Tlymphocyte immunophenotyping was held in Atlanta, Georgia, on December 12-13, 1995, to discuss these changes. Information shared at the conference and new data collected about laboratory testing practices serve as the basis for the revisions and additions that have been made to the 1994 guidelines. These changes include a quality assurance (namely, revision of the recommended monoclonal panel to provide a cost-effective solution for laboratories using three-color and four-color approaches), b the importance of following manufacturers' instructions when using tests and testing devices approved by the FDA, c recommendations for laboratories performing three-and four-color T-lymphocyte immunophenotyping (TLI), and d recommendations about the validation and verification procedures that laboratories should conduct before implementing new tests.\n\n【3】 #RECOMMENDATIONS I. Laboratory Safety\nA. Use universal precautions with all specimens . B. Establish the following safety practices (38-44 ):\n1. Wear laboratory coats and gloves when processing and analyzing specimens, including reading specimens on the flow cytometer.\n2. Never pipette by mouth. Use safety pipetting devices.\n3. Never recap needles. Dispose of needles and syringes in puncture-proof containers designed for this purpose.\n4. Handle and manipulate specimens (e.g. aliquoting, adding reagents, vortexing, and aspirating) in a class I or II biological safety cabinet.\n5. Centrifuge specimens in safety carriers.\n6. After working with specimens, remove gloves and wash hands with soap and water.\n7. For stream-in-air flow cytometers, follow the manufacturer's recommended procedures to eliminate the operator's exposure to any aerosols or droplets of sample material.\n8. Disinfect flow cytometer wastes. Add a volume of undiluted household bleach (5% sodium hypochlorite) to the waste container before adding waste materials so that the final concentration of bleach will be 10% (0.5% sodium hypochlorite) when the container is full (e.g. add 100 mL of undiluted bleach to an empty 1,000-mL container).\n9. Disinfect the flow cytometer as recommended by the manufacturer. One method is to flush the flow cytometer fluidics with a 10% bleach solution for 5-10 minutes at the end of the day, then flush with water or saline for at least 10 minutes to remove excess bleach, which is corrosive.\n10. Disinfect spills with household bleach or an appropriate dilution of mycobactericidal disinfectant. Note: Organic matter will reduce the ability of bleach to disinfect infectious agents For use on smooth, hard surfaces, a 1% solution of bleach is usually adequate for disinfection; for porous surfaces, a 10% solution is needed .\n11. Assure that all samples have been properly fixed after staining and lysing, but before analysis. Note: Some commercial lysing/fixing reagents will reduce the infectious activity of cell-associated HIV by 3-5 logs ; however, these reagents have not been evaluated for their effectiveness against other agents (e.g. hepatitis virus). Buffered (pH 7.0-7.4) 1%-2% paraformaldehyde or formaldehyde can inactivate cell-associated HIV to approximately the same extent . Cell-free HIV can be inactivated with 1% paraformaldehyde within 30 minutes . Because the commercial lysing/fixing reagents do not completely inactivate cellassociated HIV and the time frame for complete inactivation is not firmly established, stained and lysed samples should be resuspended and retained in fresh 1%-2% paraformaldehyde or formaldehyde through flow cytometric analysis.\n\n【4】 #II. Specimen Collection\nA. Select the appropriate anticoagulant for hematologic testing and flow cytometric immunophenotyping.\n1. Anticoagulant for hematologic testing: a. Use tripotassium ethylenediamine tetra-acetate (K 3 EDTA, 1.5 ± 0.15 mg/mL blood) , and perform the test within the time frame allowed by the manufacturer of the hematology analyzer, not to exceed 30 hours.\nb. Reject a specimen that cannot be processed within this time frame unless the hematology instrumentation is suitable for analyzing such specimens. Note: Some hematology instruments are capable of generating accurate results 12-30 hours after specimen collection . To ensure accurate results for specimens from HIV-infected persons, laboratories must validate their hematology instrument's ability to give the same result at time 0 and at the maximum time claimed by the manufacturer when using specimens from both persons infected with HIV and those not infected.\n2. Anticoagulant for flow cytometric immunophenotyping, depending on the delay anticipated before sample processing: a. Use K3EDTA, acid citrate dextrose (ACD), or heparin if specimens will be processed within 30 hours after collection. Note: K 3 EDTA should not be used for specimens held for >30 hours before testing because the proportion of some lymphocyte populations changes after this period .\nb. Use either ACD or heparin, not K 3 EDTA, if specimens will be processed within 48 hours after specimen collection.\nc. Reject a specimen that cannot be processed within 48 hours after specimen collection and request another.\nB. Collect blood specimens by venipuncture  into evacuated tubes containing an appropriate anticoagulant, completely expending the vacuum in the tubes.\n1. Draw specimens from children in pediatric tubes to avoid underdrawing.\n2. Mix the blood well with the anticoagulant to prevent clotting.\nC. Draw the appropriate number of tubes:\n1. Use one tube containing K 3 EDTA when a hematology and flow cytometric immunophenotyping will be performed in the same laboratory on the same specimen or b a single measurement is performed on the flow cytometer that results in an absolute number. Note: For single-platform methods that do not use determinations from a hematology analyzer or from conventional flow cytometers to derive absolute CD4+ T-cell numbers, follow the manufacturer's recommendations for anticoagulant and maximum times between specimen collection and testing.\n2. In all other circumstances, draw two separate tubes (K 3 EDTA for hematologic determinations and K 3 EDTA, ACD, or heparin for flow cytometric immunophenotyping).\nD. Label all specimens with the date, time of collection, and a unique patient identifier.\n1. Assure that patient information and test results are accorded confidentiality.\n2. Provide on the submission form pertinent medications and disease conditions that may affect the immunophenotyping test .\n\n【5】 #III. Specimen Transport\nA. Maintain and transport specimens at room temperature (64-72 F ) ,52. Avoid extremes in temperature so that specimens do not freeze or become too hot. Temperatures >99 F (37 C) may cause cellular destruction and affect both hematology and flow cytometry measurements .\nIn hot weather, packing the specimen in an insulated container and placing this container inside another containing an ice pack and absorbent material may be necessary. This method helps retain the specimen at ambient temperature. The effect of cool temperatures (i.e. 39 F ) on immunophenotyping results is not clear .\nB. Transport specimens to the immunophenotyping laboratory as soon as possible.\nC. For transport to locations outside the collection facility but within the state, follow state or local guidelines. One method for packaging such specimens is to place the tube containing the specimen in a leak-proof container (e.g. a sealed plastic bag) and to pack this container inside a cardboard canister containing sufficient material to absorb all the blood should the tube break or leak. Cap the canister tightly. Fasten the request slip securely to the outside of this canister with a rubber band. For mailing, this canister should be placed inside another canister containing the mailing label.\nD. For interstate shipment, follow federal guidelines- for transporting diagnostic specimens. Note: Use overnight carriers with an established record of consistent overnight delivery to ensure arrival the following day. Check with these carriers for their specific packaging requirements.\nE. Obtain specific protocols and arrange appropriate times of collection and transport from the facility collecting the specimen.\n\n【6】 #IV. Specimen Integrity\nA. Inspect the tube and its contents immediately upon arrival.\nB. Take corrective actions if the following occur:\n1. If the specimen is hot or cold to the touch but not obviously hemolyzed or frozen, process it but note the temperature condition on the worksheet and report form. Do not rapidly warm or chill specimens to bring them to room temperature because this may adversely affect the immunophenotyping results . Abnormalities in light-scattering patterns will reveal a compromised specimen.\n1. Perform the hematologic tests within the time frame specified by the manufacturer of the specific hematology instrument used (time from blood specimen draw to hematologic test).\n2. Perform an automated WBC count and differential, counting 10,000-30,000 cells . If the specimen is rejected or \"flagged\" by the instrument, a manual differential of at least 400 cells can be performed. If the flag is not on the lymphocyte population and the lymphocyte differential is reported by the instrument, the automated lymphocyte differential should be used.\n3. If absolute counts are determined by using a single-platform method, hematology results are not needed for this determination.\nB. Immunophenotyping 1. For optimal results, perform the test within 30 hours, but no later than 48 hours, after drawing the blood specimen .\n2. When centrifuging, maintain centrifugation forces of no greater than 400 g for 3-5 minutes for wash steps.\n4. Include a source of protein (e.g. fetal bovine serum or bovine serum albumin) in the wash buffer to reduce cell clumps and non-specific fluorescence.\n5. Incubate all tubes in the dark during the immunophenotyping procedure.\n6. Before analysis on the flow cytometer, be sure all samples have been adequately fixed. Although some of the commercial lysing/fixing reagents can inactivate cell-associated HIV, all tubes should be fixed after staining and lysing with 1%-2% buffered paraformaldehyde or formaldehyde. Note: The characteristics of paraformaldehyde and formaldehyde may vary between lots. They may also lose their effectiveness over time. Therefore, these fixatives should be made fresh weekly from electronmicroscopy-grade aqueous stock.\n7. Immediately after processing the specimens, store all stained samples in the dark and at refrigerator temperatures (39-50 F ) until flow cytometric analysis. These specimens should be stored for no longer than 24 hours unless the laboratory can demonstrate that scatter and fluorescence patterns do not change for specimens stored longer.\n8. If absolute counts are determined on the flow cytometer, follow the manufacturer's recommended protocols.\n\n【7】 #VI. Monoclonal Antibody Panels\nA. Monoclonal antibody panels must contain appropriate monoclonal antibody combinations to enumerate CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells and to ensure the quality of the results .\n1. CD4 T-cells must be identified as being positive for both CD3 and CD4.\nB. Two-color monoclonal antibody panels 1. The recommended two-color immunophenotyping antibody panel , delineated by CD nomenclature , 62  2. An abbreviated two-color panel should only be used for testing specimens from patients for whom CD4+ T-cell levels are being requested as part of sequential follow-up, and then only after consulting with the requesting clinician. Because some of the internal controls are no longer included, when using an abbreviated panel, the immunophenotyping results should be reviewed carefully to ensure that CD3+ T-cell levels are similar to those determined previously with the full recommended panel. When discrepancies occur, the specimens must be reprocessed by using the full recommended two-color monoclonal antibody panel.\n\n【8】 #VII. Negative and Positive Controls for Immunophenotyping\nA. Negative (isotype) reagent control 1. Use this control to determine nonspecific binding of the mouse monoclonal antibody to the cells and to set markers for distinguishing fluorescence-negative and fluorescence-positive cell populations.\n2. Use a monoclonal antibody with no specificity for human blood cells but of the same isotype(s) as the test reagents. Note: In many cases, the isotype control may not be optimal for controlling nonspecific fluorescence because of differences in F/P ratio, antibody concentration between the isotype control and the test reagents, and other characteristics of the immunoglobulin in the isotype control. Additionally, isotype control reagents from one manufacturer are not appropriate for use with test reagents from another manufacturer.\n3. The isotype control is not needed for use with CD45 because CD45 is used to identify leukocyte populations based on fluorescence intensity.\n4. For monoclonal antibody panels containing antibodies to CD3, CD4, and CD8, the isotype control may not be needed because labeling with these antibodies results in fluorescence patterns in which the unlabeled cells are clearly separated from the labeled cells. In these instances, the negative cells in the histogram are the appropriate isotype control.\n5. The isotype control must be used when a monoclonal antibody panel contains monoclonal antibodies that label populations that do not have a distinct negative population (e.g. some CD16 or CD56 monoclonal antibodies).\nB. Positive methodologic control 1. The methodologic control is used to determine whether procedures for preparing and processing the specimens are optimal. This control is prepared each time specimens from patients are prepared.\n2. Use either a whole-blood specimen from a control donor or commercial materials validated for this purpose. Ideally, this control will match the population of patients tested in the laboratory.\n3. If the methodologic control falls outside established normal ranges, determine the reason. Note: The purpose of the methodologic control is to detect problems in preparing and processing the specimens. Biologic factors that cause only the whole-blood methodologic control to fall outside normal ranges do not invalidate the results from other specimens processed at the same time. Poor lysis or poor labeling in all specimens, including the methodologic control, invalidates results.\nC. Positive control for testing reagents 1. Use this control to test the labeling efficiency of new lots of reagents or when the labeling efficiency of the current lot is questioned. Prepare this control only when needed (i.e. when reagents are in question) in parallel with lots of reagents of known acceptable performance. Note: New reagents must demonstrate similar results to those of known acceptable performance.\n2. Use a whole-blood specimen or other human lymphocyte preparation (e.g. cryopreserved or commercially obtained lyophilized lymphocytes).\n\n【9】 #VIII.Flow Cytometer Quality Control\nA. Align optics daily. This ensures that the brightest and tightest peaks are produced in all parameters. Note: Some clinical flow cytometers can be aligned by laboratory personnel whereas others can be aligned only by qualified service personnel.\n1. Align the flow cytometer by using stable calibration material (e.g. microbeads labeled with fluorochromes) that has measurable forward scatter, side scatter, and fluorescence peaks.\n2. Align the calibration particles optimally in the path of the laser beam and in relation to the collection lens so the brightest and tightest peaks are obtained.\n3. Align stream-in-air flow cytometers daily (at a minimum) and stream-incuvette flow cytometers (most clinical flow cytometers are this type) as recommended by the manufacturer.\nB. Standardize daily. This ensures that the flow cytometer is performing optimally each day and that its performance is the same from day to day.\n1. Select machine settings that are optimal for fluorochrome-labeled, whole-blood specimens.\n2. Use microbeads or other stable standardization material to place the scatter and fluorescence peaks in the same scatter and fluorescence channels each day. Adjust the flow cytometer as needed.\n3. Maintain records of all daily standardizations. Monitor these to identify any changes in flow cytometer performance.\n4. Retain machine standardization settings for the remaining quality control procedures (sensitivity and color compensation) and for reading the specimens.\nC. Determine fluorescence resolution daily. The flow cytometer must differentiate between the dim peak and autofluorescence in each fluorescence channel.\n2. Establish a minimal acceptable distance between peaks, monitor this difference, and correct any daily deviations.\nD. Compensate for spectral overlap daily. This step corrects the spectral overlap of one fluorochrome into the fluorescence spectrum of another.\n1. Use either microbead or cellular compensation material containing three populations for two-color immunofluorescence (no fluorescence, PE fluorescence only, and FITC fluorescence only), four populations for three-color immunofluorescence (the three above plus a population that is positive for only the third color), or five populations for four-color (the four above plus a population that is positive for only the fourth color).\n2. Analyze this material and adjust the electronic compensation circuits on the flow cytometer to place the fluorescent populations in their respective fluorescence quadrants with no overlap into the double-positive quadrant . If three fluorochromes are used, compensation must be carried out in an appropriate sequence: FITC, PE, and the third color, respectively . For four-color monoclonal antibody panels, follow the flow cytometer manufacturer's instructions for four fluorochromes.\nAvoid over-compensation.\n3. If standardization or calibration particles (microbeads) have been used to set compensation, confirm proper calibration by using lymphocytes labeled with FITC-and PE-labeled monoclonal antibodies (and a thirdcolor-or fourth-color-labeled monoclonal antibody for three-color or four-color panels) that recognize separate cell populations but do not overlap. These populations should have the brightest expected signals.\nNote: If a dimmer-than-expected signal is used to set compensation, suboptimal compensation for the brightest signal can result.\n4. Reset compensation when photomultiplier tube voltages or optical filters are changed.\nE. Repeat all four instrument quality control procedures whenever instrument problems occur or if the instrument is serviced during the day.\nF. Maintain instrument quality-control logs, and monitor them continually for changes in any of the parameters. In the logs, record instrument settings, peak channels, and coefficient of variation (CV) values for optical alignment, standardization, fluorescence resolution, and spectral compensation. Reestablish fluorescence levels for each quality-control procedure when lot numbers of beads are changed.\n\n【10】 #IX. Sample Analyses\nA. For the two-color immunophenotyping panel using a light-scatter gate, analyze the sample tubes of each patient's specimen in the following order:\n1 The tube containing CD45 and CD14 (gating reagent): read this tube first so that gates can be set around the lymphocyte cluster; 2 Isotype control: set cursors for differentiating positive and negative populations so that ≤2% of the cells are positive; and 3 Remaining tubes in the panel.\n1. Count at least 2,500 gated lymphocytes in each sample. This number ensures with 95% confidence that the result is ≤2% standard deviation (SD) of the \"true'' value (binomial sampling). Note: This model assumes that variability determined from preparing and analyzing replicates is ≤2% SD. Each laboratory must determine the level of variability by preparing and analyzing at least eight replicates of the last four tubes in the recommended panel. Measure variability when first validating the methodology used and again when methodologic changes are made.\n\n【11】 #X. Data Analysis\nA. Light-scatter gate (for two-color panels).\n1. Reading from the sample tube containing CD45 and CD14, draw lymphocyte gates using forward and side light-scattering patterns and fluorescence staining.\na. When using CD45 and CD14 and light-scattering patterns for drawing lymphocyte gates, define populations on the following basis:\n- Lymphocytes stain brightly with CD45 and are negative for CD14.\n- Monocytes and granulocytes have greater forward and side lightscattering properties than lymphocytes.\n- Granulocytes are dimly positive for CD14 and show less intense staining with CD45.\n- Debris, red cells, and platelets show lower forward scattering than lymphocytes and do not stain specifically with CD45 or CD14.\nb. Using the above characteristics, draw a light-scattering gate around the lymphocyte population . Note: Other methods for drawing a lymphocyte gate must accurately identify lymphocytes and account for non-lymphocyte contamination of the gate.\n2. Verify the lymphocyte gate by determining the recovery of lymphocytes within the gate and the lymphocyte purity of the gate.\na. Definitions\n- The lymphocyte recovery (previously referred to as the proportion of lymphocytes within the gate) is the percentage of lymphocytes in the sample that are within the gate.\nb. Optimally, the lymphocyte recovery should be ≥95%.\nc. Optimally, the lymphocyte purity of the gate should be ≥90%.\nd. Optimal gates include as many lymphocytes and as few contaminants as possible.\ne. Lymphocyte recovery within the gate using CD45 and CD14 can be determined by two different methods: light-scatter gating and fluorescence gating . Note: The number of lymphocytes identified will be the same whether determined by light-scatter gating or by fluorescence gating.\n- Lymphocyte recovery determined by light-scatter gating is done as follows: first, identify the lymphocytes by setting a relatively large light-scatter gate , then set an analysis region around CD45 and CD14 lymphocyte reactivity (bright CD45-positive, negative for CD14) . Determine the number of cells that meet both criteria (total number of lymphocytes). Set a smaller lymphocyte light-scatter gate that will be used for analyzing the remaining tubes . Determine the number of cells that fall within this gate and the CD45/ CD14 analysis region (bright CD45-positive, negative for CD14) . This number divided by the total number of lymphocytes times 100 is the lymphocyte recovery. The advantage of this method is that it can easily be done on most software programs.\nf. The lymphocyte purity of the gate is determined from the CD45 and CD14 tube by calculating the percentage of cells in the light-scattering gate that are bright CD45-positive and negative for CD14.  3. CD45/side scatter gates for lymphocytes are assumed to contain >95% lymphocytes, and no further corrections need be made to the percentage subset results .\n4. Lymphocyte recovery cannot be determined without using a panel of monoclonal antibodies that identify T-, B-, and NK-cells. Note: Validation of a CD45/side scatter gate is recommended when beginning to use CD45/ side scatter gates to help determine the CD45 and side scatter characteristics of T-, B-, and NK-cells and to ensure their inclusion in the gate.\nC. Set cursors using the isotype control so that <2% of cells are positive. Note:\nIf an isotype control is not used, set cursors based on the tube containing CD3 and CD4 so that the negative and positive cells in the histogram are clearly separated. These cursors may be used for the remaining tubes. If  CD16 and/or CD56 are included in a monoclonal antibody panel, an isotype control may be needed to help identify negative cells.\nD. Analyze the remaining samples with the cursors set. Note: In some instances, the isotype-set cursors will not accurately separate positive and negative staining for another sample tube from the same specimen. In such cases, the cursors can be moved on that sample to more accurately separate these populations. The cursors should not be moved when fluorescence distributions are continuous with no clear demarcation between positively and negatively labeled cells.\nE. Analyze each patient or control specimen with lymphocyte gates and cursors for positivity set for that particular patient or control.\nF. When spectral compensation of a particular specimen appears to be inappropriate because FITC-labeled cells have been dragged into the PE-positive quadrant or vice-versa (when compensation on all other specimens is appropriate) , repeat the sample preparation, prewashing the specimen with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.2) to remove plasma before monoclonal antibodies are added.\nG. Include the following analytic reliability checks, when available:\n1. Optimally, at least 95% lymphocyte recovery (proportion of lymphocytes within the lymphocyte gate) should be achieved. Minimally, at least 90% lymphocyte recovery should be achieved. Note: These determinations can only be made when using either CD14 and CD45 to validate the gate or when using T, B, and NK reagents to validate a gate.\nOptimally, ≥90% lymphocyte purity should be observed within the lymphocyte gate. Minimally, ≥85% purity should be observed within the gate.\n3. Optimally, the sum of the percentage of CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+ cells should equal the total percentage of CD3+ cells within ±5%, with a maximum variability of ≤10%. Note: In specimens containing a considerable number of T γδ cells .\n\n【12】 #XI. Data Storage\nA. If possible, store list-mode data on all specimens analyzed. This allows for reanalysis of the raw data, including redrawing of gates. At a minimum, retain hard copies of the lymphocyte gate and correlated dual histogram data of the fluorescence of each sample.\nB. Retain all primary files, worksheets, and report forms for 2 years or as required by state or local regulation, whichever is longer. Data can be stored electronically. Disposal after the retention period is at the discretion of the laboratory director. B. If using light-scatter gates, report data as a percentage of the total lymphocytes and correct for the lymphocyte purity of the gate. For example, if the lymphocyte purity is 94% and the CD3 value is 70%, correct the CD3 value by dividing 0.70 by 0.94 and then multiply the result by 100 to result in a T-lymphocyte value of 74%.\n\n【13】 #XII. Data Reporting\nC. Report absolute lymphocyte subset values when an automated complete blood cell (CBC) count (WBC and differential) has been performed from blood drawn at the same time as that for immunophenotyping.\n\n【14】 #XIII.Quality Assurance\nA. Assure the overall quality of the laboratory's CD4+ T-cell testing by monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of the laboratory policies and procedures for the preanalytic, analytic, and postanalytic testing phases. The practices and processes to be monitored and evaluated include:\n1. Methods for collecting, handling, transporting, identifying, processing, and storing specimens.\n2. Information provided on test request and results report forms.\n3. Instrument performance, quality-control protocols, and maintenance.\n4. Reagent quality-control protocols.\n5. Process for reviewing and reporting results. 8. Review and revision (as necessary, or at established intervals) of the laboratory's policies and procedures to assure adherence to the quality assurance program. All staff involved in the testing should be informed of any problems identified during the quality assurance review, and the corrective actions should be taken to prevent recurrences.\nB. Document all quality assurance activities.\n\n【15】 #LABORATORY VALIDATION OF SINGLE-PLATFORM CD4+ T-CELL METHODS\nWhen performing method-validation studies on the new single-platform methods for enumerating CD4+ T-cell populations, laboratorians must consider that these assays may determine the absolute CD4+ count using methodologies that are very different from multi-platform techniques. In most clinical settings, multi-platform methods do not perform at the level of a gold standard. Still, the single-platform methods must be compared with accepted methods or testing procedures. When no optimal standard exists and bias is present, the amount of error contributed by each method cannot be determined. Therefore, if results yielded from a single-platform method are significantly different from those obtained using a multi-platform method, the new method is not necessarily in error. Conducting a large-scale study correlating results from single-platform methods with clinical disease data to establish new medical decision points may be the only surrogate for comparison with a gold standard. Laboratories should not adopt methods that yield results significantly different from multi-platform methods until these studies can be performed, published, and accepted by the scientific and medical communities.\nTraditional method comparison tools may be used for validation of single-platform methods that compare favorably with multi-platform methods. Single-platform methods, as the name implies, derive the absolute CD4+ T-cell counts from a single measurement and therefore have the potential to yield a less variable (although not necessarily more accurate) analysis than multi-platform methods, which utilize a combination of hematology and flow cytometry measurements. Laboratorians should utilize statistical tools that provide useful information about these new methodologies but that do not presume that either the comparative or test method is definitive. Linear least squares regression analysis must be conducted based on the assumption that no error exists in the comparative method, and regression-type scatter plots provide inadequate resolution when the errors are small in comparison to the analytical range . Once a new method is accepted and implemented, the laboratory should continue to monitor the correlation between the results and the patient's clinical disease data to ensure that no problems have gone undetected by the relatively few samples typically tested during method evaluations.\n\n【16】 #DISCUSSION\nOn the basis of the reported number of tests performed annually by laboratories participating in CDC's Model Performance Evaluation Program for T-lymphocyte immunophenotyping in 1995, more than 1.6 million CD4+ T-cell measurements are performed yearly by the approximately 600 testing laboratories in the United States . Most of these measurements are made by using multi-platform flow cytometric methods, although new single-platform methods (both flow cytometric and others) are available . Recommendations concerning CD4+ T-lymphocyte immunophenotyping have focused on the more complex multi-platform process of measuring CD4+ T-cells. The recommendations for testing have increasingly been adopted , and as a result, laboratorians have reported improved testing practices .\nAlthough data suggest that guidelines for CD4+ T-cell lymphocyte immunophenotyping have improved many laboratory practices, developing guidelines that address every aspect of CD4+ T-cell testing (including some laboratory-specific practices) is not possible. Moreover, measuring the outcomes associated with the adoption of these guidelines is inherently difficult. First, the guidelines lack evaluation protocols that can adequately account for the interactions among recommendations. No weight of importance has been assigned for the individual recommendations that address unique steps in the testing process; hence, the consequences of incompletely following the entire set of recommendations are uncertain. Second, because published data were not available as the basis for every guideline, some recommendations are based on experience and expert opinion. Recommendations made on this basis, in the absence of data, may be biased and inaccurate. Finally, variations in testing practices and interactions among the practices (e.g. how specimens are obtained and processed, laboratory personnel credentials and experience, testing methods used, test-result reporting practices, and compliance with other voluntary standards and laboratory regulations) complicate both development of guidelines that will fit every laboratory's unique circumstances and measurement of the value of guideline implementation.\nWhen the first CDC recommendations for laboratory performance of CD4+ T-cell testing were developed, the guidelines were written so as not to impede development of new technology or investigations into better ways to assess the status of the immune system in HIV-infected persons. Presentations at the second national conference in Atlanta indicated that although CD4+ T-cell testing by multi-platform flow cytometry is still being performed by most laboratories, other single-platform methods are being implemented. In addition, alternative T-cell phenotypic markers are being investigated as prognostic indicators or markers of treatment efficacy, alone and in combination with other markers .\nParticipants at the second national conference emphasized the need for monitoring the intralaboratory and interlaboratory accuracy, precision, and reliability of current and new procedures. Decisions about implementing and modifying procedures should be based on performance data collected to assess the extent to which the quality goals established by providers and users of laboratory testing services are achieved . In testing areas where no absolute gold standards exist (e.g. CD4+ T-cell enumeration), method validation and verification processes are even more critical. Laboratorians should continue to rely on as many sources of information and data as possible to help in their decision processes. Factors that have contributed to improved testing practices and that are important resources for laboratorians include regulatory- and voluntary laboratory standards ; manufacturer's recommendations; proficiency testing and performance evaluation program data; information shared at scientific conferences, meetings, and training sessions; and publications in scientific literature.\n\n【17】 Effects of medications and other biologic factors on immunophenotyping results", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

A pathognomonic sign is a particular sign whose presence means, beyond any doubt, that a particular disease is present. It is derived from the Greek páthos (πάθος, disease) and gnōmon (γνώμον, \"judge\"). Labelling a sign or symptom \"pathognomonic\" represents a marked intensification of a \"diagnostic\" sign or symptom.\nWhile some findings may be classic, typical or highly suggestive in a certain condition, they may not occur uniquely in this condition and therefore may not directly imply a specific diagnosis. A pathognomonic finding on the other hand allows immediate diagnosing, since there are no other conditions in the differential diagnosis. A pathognomonic sign or symptom can sometimes be absent in a certain disease, since the term only implies that when it is present, the doctor instantly knows the patient's illness.\nSingular pathognomonic signs are relatively uncommon. Examples of pathognomonic findings include Koplik's spots inside the mouth in measles, the palmar xanthomata seen on the hands of people suffering from hyperlipoproteinemia, or a tetrad of rash, arthralgia, abdominal pain and kidney disease in a child with Henoch-Schönlein purpura.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

The NADPH in turn maintains the level of glutathione in these cells that helps protect the red blood cells against oxidative damage. Of greater quantitative importance is the production of NADPH for tissues actively engaged in biosynthesis of fatty acids and/or isoprenoids, such as the liver, mammary glands, adipose tissue, and the adrenal glands.\n\n【2】 ## Regulation\nGlucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase is stimulated by its substrate NADP+. The usual ratio of NADPH/NADP+ in the cytosol of tissues engaged in biosyntheses is about 100/1. Increased utilization of NADPH for fatty acid biosynthesis will dramatically increase the level of NADP+, thus stimulating G6PD to produce more NADPH.\nG6PD converts glucose-6-phosphate into 6-phosphoglucono-δ-lactone and is the rate-limiting enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway.\nG6PD is remarkable for its genetic diversity.

There is also guidance on different service delivery models for testing; pre and post-test counselling; and tailored testing approaches in specific populations (e.g. PWID, prisoners, pregnant women, children and adolescents).\nxxiii FIG. 1. Organization of the guidelines along the continuum of care\n\n【1】 #Summary of recommendations\ne. testing approaches; how to test (i.e. testing strategies), and interventions to promote uptake of testing and linkage to care. Figures 2 and 3 show summary algorithms for diagnosis, monitoring and management of chronic hepatitis B and C infection.\n\n【2】 #Who to test for HBV and HCV infection -testing approaches\nThe guidelines recommend offering focused testing to individuals from populations most affected by HBV or HCV infection (i.e. who are either part of a population with higher seroprevalence or who have a history of exposure to or high-risk behaviours for HBV or HCV infection). In settings with a ≥2% or ≥5% seroprevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or HCV antibody (anti-HCV) (based on existing published thresholds for intermediate or high seroprevalence, respectively), it is recommended that all adults have routine access to and be offered testing (i.e. a general population testing approach), or use \"birth cohort\" testing for specific age groups with higher anti-HCV seroprevalence. However, the threshold used by a country will depend on other country considerations and epidemiological context. Overall, these different testing approaches should make use of existing facility-based (such as antenatal clinics, HIV or TB services) or xxiv community-based testing opportunities and programmes.\nHow to test for HBV and HCV infection -serological assays and testing strategies Overall, the guidelines recommend the use of a single quality-assured serological in vitro diagnostic test ,i.e. either a laboratory-based immunoassay  or rapid diagnostic test to detect HBsAg and HCV antibody. RDTs used should meet minimum performance standards, and be delivered at the point of care to improve access and linkage to care and treatment. There is also a recent caution on the need to test for HBV infection and consider antiviral therapy prior to starting DAA therapy in HBV/HCV coinfected persons, because of a potential risk of HBV reactivation and worsening of liver disease.\nConfirming viraemic infection and monitoring for treatment response Following a reactive HCV antibody serological test result, a quantitative or qualitative RNA NAT is recommended as the preferred testing strategy to diagnose viraemic infection. Detection of core HCV antigen, where the assay has comparable clinical sensitivity to NAT technologies, may be considered as an alternative. The use of HBV DNA NAT following a reactive HBsAg serological test result, is recommended to help further guide who to treat or not treat if there is no evidence of cirrhosis, and to monitor for treatment response, based on existing recommendations from the 2015 WHO HBV management guidelines.\nUse of dried blood spot sampling and other strategies to promote testing uptake and linkage to care The use of capillary whole blood DBS specimens for both serological and NAT technologies for HBV and HCV infection may be considered to facilitate access to testing in certain settings where there are either no facilities or expertise to take venous blood specimens, in persons with poor venous access, or where qualityassured RDTs are not available or their use is not feasible. Programmes should consider only the use of assays that have been validated by their manufacturer for use with DBS specimens. Other recommended interventions to promote uptake of hepatitis testing and linkage to care include peer and lay health worker support in community-based settings, clinician reminders in facilities, and testing as part of integrated services within drug treatment and communitybased harm reduction services.\nThe development of these guidelines was conducted in accordance with procedures established by the WHO Guidelines Review Committee. Clinical recommendations were formulated by a regionally representative and multidisciplinary Guidelines Development Group at a meeting held in September 2015. The GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development xxv and Evaluation) approach was used to formulate and categorize strength of recommendations (strong or conditional), and was adapted for diagnostic tests. This includes an assessment of the quality of evidence (high, moderate, low or very low), consideration of overall balance of benefits and harms (at individual and population levels), patient/health worker values and preferences, resource use, cost-effectiveness and consideration of feasibility and effectiveness across a variety of resource-limited settings, including where access to laboratory infrastructure and specialized tests is limited. There was a very limited evidence base to guide recommendations on testing approaches (i.e. who to test and service delivery approaches) and an absence of evidence on patient-important outcomes in evaluation of performance of diagnostic tests and testing strategies.\nImplementation of these recommendations pose practical challenges to policymakers and implementers in LMICs, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, where there is currently very limited access to diagnostic tests, antiviral therapies and appropriate laboratory infrastructure. These guidelines also provide the framework for country decision-making and planning for hepatitis laboratory testing programmes to ensure the quality and accuracy of hepatitis testing, as well as approaches to delivery of testing services, including opportunities to integrate hepatitis testing with existing services, where appropriate.\nThese guidelines and recommendations provide a major opportunity to improve identification and treatment of persons with chronic hepatitis B and C, and achieve the Global Hepatitis Health Sector Strategy (GHSS) on Viral Hepatitis 3 targets, including those on testing (i.e. identify 30% of persons living with HBV and HCV by 2020 and 90% by 2030). This in turn will improve clinical outcomes and save lives, as well as facilitate prevention, reducing hepatitis transmission and new infections.\nxxvi FIG. 2.

Exposed infants should be tested for HBsAg between 6 and 12 months of age to screen for evidence of hepatitis B infection. In all age groups, acute HBV infection can be confirmed by the presence of HBsAg and IgM anti-HBc. CHB is diagnosed if there is persistence of HBsAg for six months or more. 2 Laboratory-based immunoassays include enzyme immunoassay (EIA), chemoluminescence immunoassay (CLIA), and electrochemoluminescence assay (ECL). 3 Assays should meet minimum acceptance criteria of either WHO prequalification of in vitro diagnostics (IVDs) or a stringent regulatory review for IVDs. All IVDs should be used in accordance with manufacturers' instructions for use and where possible at testing sites enrolled in a national or international external quality assessment scheme. 4 Based on results of predictive modelling of positive predictive values according to different thresholds of seroprevalence in populations to be tested, and assay diagnostic performance. 5 A repeat HBsAg assay after 6 months is also a common approach used to confirm chronicity of HBV infection Guidelines for the prevention, care and treatment of persons with chronic hepatitis B infection: World Health Organization; 2015. 7 In persons on treatment, monitor for HBsAg loss (although this occurs rarely), and for seroreversion to HBsAg positivity after discontinuation of treatment. 8 Monitoring of HBeAg/anti-HBe mainly applies to those who are initially HBeAg positive. However, those who have already achieved HBeAg seroconversion and are HBeAg negative and anti-HBe positive may serorevert. 9 Decompensated cirrhosis is defined by the development of portal hypertension (ascites, variceal haemorrhage and hepatic encephalopathy), coagulopathy, or liver insufficiency (jaundice). Other clinical features of advanced liver disease/cirrhosis may include: hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, pruritus, fatigue, arthralgia, palmar erythema and oedema.\n\n【13】 #Serological testing strategies\nIn adults and children older than 18 months 1 a single serological assay for initial detection of serological evidence of past or present infection is recommended prior to supplementary nucleic acid testing (NAT) for evidence of viraemic infection.\n\n【14】 #Detection of viraemic infection\n- Directly following a reactive HCV antibody serological test result, the use of quantitative or qualitative NAT for detection of HCV RNA is recommended as the preferred strategy to diagnose viraemic infection.\nStrong recommendation, moderate/low quality of evidence - An assay to detect HCV core (p22) antigen, which has comparable clinical sensitivity to NAT, is an alternative to NAT to diagnose viraemic infection 4.  1 respectively, may be considered in settings where: -there is a lack of access to sites or nearby laboratory facilities for NAT, or provision for timely delivery of specimens to a laboratory; or there are persons with poor venous access (e.g. in drug treatment programmes, prisons). Conditional recommendation, low (HBV)/moderate (HCV) quality of evidence The GRADE system (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) was used to categorize the strength of recommendations as strong or conditional (based on consideration of the quality of evidence, balance of benefits and harms, acceptability, resource use and programmatic feasibility) and the quality of evidence as high, moderate, low or very low. 1 Well-functioning laboratory specimens referral network and system for return of results should be in place to maximize the impact of DBS specimens. There are currently few assays where the manufacturer's instructions state that DBS specimens are validated for use. Therefore, currently use of DBS specimens would be considered \"off-label\".\n\n【15】 #INTERVENTIONS TO PROMOTE UPTAKE OF HEPATITIS TESTING AND LINKAGE TO CARE\nPART 1: BACKGROUND treatment regimens with high rates of cure has revolutionized the treatment of chronic HCV infection , although the high prices of the new medicines remain a major barrier to access in many countries . For people with chronic HBV infection, effective long-term suppressive treatment with tenofovir or entecavir is available .\nDespite the high global burden of disease due to chronic hepatitis B and C infection, and the advances and opportunities for treatment, most people infected with HBV and/or HCV remain unaware of their infection and therefore frequently present with advanced disease. The extent of this hidden burden is poorly documented, and largely based on limited data from higher-income settings . However, in low-income settings, it is estimated that less than 5% are aware of their diagnosis. This contrasts with the considerable recent progress in HIV testing coverage, whereby now more than half of all people living with HIV globally are aware of their status . Early identification of persons with chronic HBV or HCV infection would enable infected persons to receive the necessary care and treatment to prevent or delay the onset of liver disease and, in addition, prevent transmission by HBV vaccination of non-immune household contacts and sex partners.\nThere are several key reasons for this current low rate of hepatitis testing in LMICs. These include the limited facilities or services for hepatitis testing, lack of effective testing policies or national standards due to weak or non-existent hepatitis surveillance programmes to inform regional epidemiology and testing policies, costly and complex diagnostic assays and algorithms, poor laboratory capacity and infrastructure, and use of poor-quality test kits and reagents. In addition, in LMICs, HBV and HCV treatment remains unaffordable for those most in need, even if they have been diagnosed.\n\n【16】 #Goals of viral hepatitis testing\nTesting and diagnosis of HBV and HCV infection is the gateway for access to both prevention as well as care and treatment services (Fig. 1.1), and is a crucial component of an effective response to the hepatitis epidemic.\nThe primary goals of testing are 1. to identify and link infected individuals, their partners and families to appropriate care and treatment services, and reduce hepatitis-related mortality by providing treatment to those in need through the use of directacting curative antiviral therapy for chronic hepatitis C and lifelong antiviral therapy for chronic hepatitis B infection;\n- to provide a link to preventive interventions to reduce transmission. For hepatitis, this includes provision of hepatitis B vaccination, and implementing individual-or facility-level prevention measures to reduce further transmission;\n- to monitor response to antiviral treatment.\nTesting is also undertaken for other reasons that are not within the scope of these guidelines. These include: surveillance for both acute hepatitis (to detect outbreaks, monitor trends in incidence and identify risk factors for new incident infections) and chronic hepatitis (to estimate the prevalence of chronic infection and monitor trends in sentinel groups) ; and screening by blood transfusion services for hepatitis B and hepatitis C infection to exclude blood donations at risk of transmitting infections from donors to recipients.\n\n【17】 #Goals and objectives of the guidelines\nThe overall objective of these guidelines is to provide the first WHO evidencebased guidance on testing for hepatitis B and C virus infection in adults, adolescents and children living, particularly in LMICs, where the burden of disease is highest and where access to treatment is becoming more readily available as treatment costs continue to decline. The guidelines are expected to provide the basis and rationale for the development of national guidelines for hepatitis testing, particularly in resource-limited settings, according to the local epidemiology of hepatitis B and C infection, health-care delivery system of the country, available resources and other determinants, with the overall aim of reducing the global burden of HBV and HCV infection.\nThe specific objectives of the guidelines are\n- to provide recommendations in the area of who to screen for hepatitis B and hepatitis C infection, and which testing strategies and algorithms to use;\n- to provide evidence summaries, Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) reviews, evaluation of the overall balance of benefits and harms, feasibility, costs and acceptability of the proposed recommendations;\n- to identify research gaps.\n\n【18】 #Scope of the guidelines\nThe overall scope of these testing guidelines is the diagnosis, counselling and linkage to care of persons with chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis C infection. They are primarily aimed at resource-limited settings where hepatitis testing programmes are not yet well developed or where quality systems are lacking. The guidelines include the following components:\n- testing approaches -who to test for chronic hepatitis B and C infection\n- testing strategy -how to test for chronic hepatitis B and C infection - interventions to promote uptake of hepatitis testing and linkage to care\n- implementation issues with regard to product selection and procurement, validation of test kits, and quality assurance (QA).\nCertain key topics were not included in the scope of work for these guidelines and are either addressed more fully in other WHO documents or guidelines, or will be included in future updates. These include: diagnosis and management of acute hepatitis B  and C infection ; surveillance of acute and chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis C ; treatment and side-effect monitoring of drugs for chronic hepatitis B and C .\n\n【19】 #Target audience\nThese guidelines are primarily targeted at national hepatitis programme managers and other policy-makers in ministries of health, particularly in LMICs, who are responsible for the development of national hepatitis testing and treatment plans, policy and guidelines.\n\n【20】 #Related WHO materials and guidelines\nThese guidelines on testing for chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis C infection are intended to complement several existing WHO guidelines.\n- Guidance on prevention of hepatitis infection in health-care settings  includes recommendations on hand hygiene, including surgical hand preparation, handwashing and use of gloves; safe handling and disposal of sharps and waste; safe cleaning of equipment; testing of donated blood and blood products; improved access to safe blood and blood products; and training of health personnel. There are also new WHO recommendations published in 2015 on the use of auto-disable syringes in immunization services, and safety-engineered injection devices, including reuse prevention (RUP) syringes and sharps injury prevention (SIP) devices for therapeutic injections  ; ; .\n\n【21】 #Promoting human rights and equity in access to hepatitis testing\nAccess to health care is a basic human right and applies equally to men, women and children, regardless of gender, race, sexual preference, socioeconomic status or behavioural practices, including drug use, and is in keeping with the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights . The promotion of human rights and equity in access to hepatitis B and C testing, prevention, treatment and care are guiding principles central to these guidelines. Persons with hepatitis B and C infection may come from vulnerable groups because of low socioeconomic status with poor access to appropriate health care, or because they belong to groups that are marginalized or stigmatized such as PWID, MSM, migrants, indigenous peoples or prisoners. Hepatitis testing services need to ensure that testing is accessible to the populations most affected, and that these groups are offered testing in an environment that minimizes stigma and discrimination. Informed consent should always be obtained. Screening for viral hepatitis must not be used as a means to discriminate against those testing positive. The provision of adequate safeguards to ensure confidentiality, and a non-coercive approach are fundamental principles of good clinical practice.\n\n【22】 #The public health approach along the continuum of care\nIn accordance with existing WHO guidance on HIV testing , use of antiretrovirals (ARVs) , and HBV and HCV treatment , these guidelines are based on a public health approach to scaling up testing and treatment for hepatitis B and C across the entire continuum of care. The public health approach seeks to ensure the widest possible access to high-quality services at the population level, based on simplified and standardized approaches that can readily be taken to scale and decentralized, including in resource-limited settings. A public health approach aims to strike a balance between implementing the best-proven standard of care and what is feasible on a large scale in resourcelimited settings, and to achieve health equity, promote gender equality, engage communities, and leverage public and private sectors in the response.\n\n【23】 #The WHO \"5 Cs\"\nThe WHO \"5 Cs\" are principles that apply to all models of hepatitis testing and in all settings: Consent, Confidentiality, Counselling, Correct test results and Connection (linkage to prevention, treatment and care services) . This means hepatitis testing for diagnosis must always be voluntary, and consent for testing informed by pre-test information. Testing should be linked to prevention, treatment, care and support services to maximize both individual and public health benefits. Mandatory, compulsory or coercive hepatitis testing is never appropriate, whether that coercion comes from a health-care provider, an employer, authorities (such as immigration services) or a partner or family member. All testing sites should ensure client confidentiality.\n\n【24】 #Accurate testing\nPatients have the right to accurate and high quality testing to ensure that those requiring treatment are identified and initiated, while those who are negative or not in need of treatment are not inappropriately treated. The foundation of accurate testing includes: (i) provision of reliable, high quality, regulatory approved test kits; (ii) qualified, trained, competent and supported testing personnel; and (iii) quality-assured testing environment that addresses quality (process) control, equipment management and maintenance, accurate recordkeeping and documentation ,standard operating procedures (SOPs), and external quality assessment (EQA) schemes. Some countries will face significant challenges as they seek to implement testing for chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis C infection due to constraints in resources and health systems. Each country will need to plan its own approach to implementing quality hepatitis testing services. Such services should be informed by the local context, including national hepatitis B and C epidemiology, availability of appropriately trained individuals and suitable laboratory capacity with quality management systems in place. Other considerations are efficient supply systems for laboratory commodities, availability of financial resources, organization and capacity of the health system, anticipated cost-effectiveness of the various interventions, and fair and equitable expansion in access.\n\n【25】 #WHO guideline development process\nThese WHO guidelines were developed following the recommendations for standard guidelines as described in the WHO Handbook for Guideline Development , and the GRADE framework  . A Guidelines Development Group was formed with representation from different geographical regions as well as from a wide range of stakeholders, including researchers, clinicians and programme managers, advocacy groups and members of organizations that represent persons living with chronic hepatitis. There was an initial scoping and planning process to formulate questions most relevant to LMICs and patientimportant outcomes .\n\n【26】 #Systematic reviews and additional background work\nSystematic reviews on diagnostic performance. Systematic reviews and metaanalyses of the primary literature were commissioned externally to address the research questions and patient-important outcomes. For evaluation of HBV and HCV diagnostics and testing strategies, there was very limited or no evidence for patient-important outcomes. The Guidelines Development Group and PICO questions considered diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values) and in some cases analytical sensitivity (limit of detection) as surrogates for patient-important outcomes, assuming reasonable linkage and access to care. Search strategies and summaries of evidence are reported in Web annex 5. The glossary provides full definitions for diagnostic and analytical test performance.\nAs part of the guidelines development process, WHO commissioned other work to provide additional data to support the recommendations. These are given below.\n- Existing systematic reviews on global and regional seroprevalence of HBsAg and HCV antibody in general population and specific high-risk populations .\n- Review of the cost-effectiveness literature of different viral hepatitis testing approaches in different settings. The evidence base for different testing approaches remains very limited, especially for impact on patient-important outcomes and in LMICs, and largely relies on observational data and modelling.\nThe limited number of cost-effectiveness studies and the heterogeneity of study populations, testing approaches and outcomes measured precluded a formal systematic review and meta-analysis. A narrative review was therefore undertaken that included studies of: (i) focused or targeted testing of the highest-risk groups; (ii) routine testing among specific birth cohorts that are readily identified and have a high prevalence of HCV infection; and (iii) routine testing throughout the entire population, in different settings.\n- Predictive modelling of testing strategies (i.e. one-or two-test serological testing strategies). There were very few studies that directly compared different testing strategies for diagnostic accuracy and therefore a predictive modelling analysis was carried out to examine the accuracy of a testing strategy across a range of performance characteristics of the assays (sensitivity and specificity) based on the systematic reviews, and a hypothetical range of prevalence of the disease in the population (10%, 2%, 0.4%) representing high-, medium-and low-prevalence settings or populations .\n- Values and preferences survey of health-care workers and implementers for different testing strategies and approaches. A four-part online survey tool was undertaken in September 2015, which covered questions on current and preferences for future HBV and HCV testing practices, including a test of HCV cure. Respondents included clinicians, patient organizations, civil society representatives, programme managers, policy-makers and pharmaceutical industry employees.\n\n【27】 #Grading of quality of evidence and strength of recommendations\nThe quality of the evidence was assessed and either rated down or rated up based on criteria specified in GRADE methods, modified for diagnostic tests and test strategies . The quality of evidence was categorized as high, moderate, low or very low .\n\n【28】 #Specific issues with rating quality of evidence for studies of diagnostic accuracy and strategies\nDiagnostic test accuracy. For evaluation of HBV and HCV diagnostics and testing strategies, there was very limited or no evidence on effects on patient-important outcomes. The Guidelines Development Group and PICO questions considered diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values) and in some cases analytical sensitivity (limit of detection) as surrogates for patientimportant outcomes, assuming reasonable linkage and access to care.\nAlthough observational studies of interventions start as low quality in GRADE, cross-sectional and cohort studies of diagnostic accuracy can provide reliable evidence , and were therefore initially categorized as high quality. Evidence was then rated down based on the presence of (i) risk of bias (using a tool designed for assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies, the QUADAS-2 tool) ; (ii) inconsistency or heterogeneity; (iii) indirectness (addressing a different population than the one under consideration); or (iv) imprecision. However, evaluating inconsistency in studies of diagnostic accuracy is a challenge because methods to measure statistical heterogeneity are lacking and inconsistency is common, and therefore we did not downgrade for indirectness.\nTesting strategies. Clinical studies to evaluate comparisons of different testing strategies and approaches were generally not available. Therefore, the Guidelines Development Group considered instead predictive modelling to generate estimates of diagnostic performance of different testing strategies. This type of evidence was not formally graded but was considered low quality because it is very indirect. BOX 3.1. Standard approach to rating the quality of evidence and strength of recommendations using the GRADE system\nThe GRADE system separates the rating of the quality of evidence from the rating of the strength of the recommendation.\nThe quality of evidence is defined as the confidence that the reported estimates of effect are adequate to support a specific recommendation. The GRADE system classifies the quality of evidence as high, moderate, low and very low ,35,37. For studies of interventions, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are initially rated as high-quality evidence but may be downgraded for several reasons, including the risk of bias, inconsistency of results across studies, indirectness of evidence, imprecision and publication bias.\nObservational studies of interventions are initially rated as low-quality evidence but may be upgraded if the magnitude of the treatment effect is very large, if multiple studies show the same effect, if evidence indicates a dose-response relationship, or if all plausible biases would underestimate the effect . The higher the quality of evidence, the more likely a strong recommendation can be made.\nA strong recommendation is one for which the Guidelines Development Group was confident that the desirable effects of adhering to the recommendation outweigh the undesirable effects.\nA conditional recommendation is one for which the Guidelines Development Group concluded that the desirable effects of adhering to the recommendation probably outweigh the undesirable effects but the Guidelines Development Group is not confident about these trade-offs. The implications of a conditional recommendation are that, although most people or settings would adopt the recommendation, many would not or would do so only under certain conditions. The reasons for making a conditional recommendation include the absence of high-quality evidence, imprecision in outcome estimates, uncertainty regarding how individuals value the outcomes, small benefits relative to harms, and benefits that may not be worth the costs (including the costs of implementing the recommendation).\n\n【29】 #Level of evidence Rationale\nHigh Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect.\nFurther research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the effect.\n\n【30】 #Very low\nAny estimate of effect is very uncertain. Desirable effects (benefits) need to be weighed against undesirable effects (risks/harms). The more the benefits outweigh the risks, the more likely a strong recommendation will be made.\n\n【31】 #Values and preferences (acceptability)\nIf the recommendation is likely to be widely accepted or highly valued, a strong recommendation will probably be made. If there are strong reasons that the recommended course of action is unlikely to be accepted, a conditional recommendation is more likely to be made.\n\n【32】 #Costs and financial implications (resource use)\nLower costs (monetary, infrastructure, equipment or human resources) or greater cost-effectiveness will more likely result in a strong recommendation.\nIf an intervention is achievable in a setting where the greatest impact is expected, a strong recommendation is more probable.\n\n【33】 #Formulation of recommendations\nAt the September 2015 meeting of the Guidelines Development Group, for each of the PICO questions , the results of the systematic reviews and the evidence profiles  were presented and reviewed. Commissioned surveys of diagnostic costs, values and preferences for different testing strategies of health-care workers and implementing partners, and a global survey of programmatic experience were also considered. Recommendations were then formulated based on the overall quality of the evidence, in addition to other considerations, including the balance between benefits and harms, values and preferences, feasibility and resource implications . The strength of the recommendations was rated as either strong (the panel was confident that the benefits of the intervention outweighed the risks) or conditional (the panel considered that the benefits of the intervention outweighed the risks, but the balance of benefits to harms and burdens was small or uncertain).\nRecommendations were then formulated and the wording finalized by the entire Group. Implementation needs were subsequently evaluated, and areas and topics requiring further research identified.\nFor recommendations based on diagnostic accuracy, the Guidelines Development Group considered potential trade-offs between diagnostic accuracy and other factors. Although diagnostic accuracy was considered a critical outcome and a reasonable surrogate for patient outcomes, tests and testing strategies associated with slightly lower diagnostic accuracy could be recommended when associated with lower costs, increased testing access and linkage to care or greater feasibility.\n\n【34】 #Declaration and management of conflicts of interest\nIn accordance with WHO policy, all members of the Guidelines Development Group and peer reviewers were required to complete and submit a WHO Declaration of Interest form (including participation in consulting and advisory panels, research support and financial investment) and, where appropriate, also provide a summary of research interests and activities. The WHO Secretariat then reviewed and assessed the declarations submitted by each member and, at the September 2015 meeting of the Guidelines Development Group, presented a summary to the Guidelines Development Group . The WHO Secretariat stated that there had been a transparent declaration of financial and academic interests, and concluded that there were no conflicts that required exclusion of any member from actively taking part in formulating the recommendations during the meeting. For the peer review group, the WHO Secretariat was also satisfied that no case necessitated exclusion from the review process.\n\n【35】 #Updating, disseminating and monitoring implementation of the guidelines\nThe guidelines are accessible on the WHO website with links to other related websites, and translated into the official United Nations (UN) languages. WHO disseminates the guidelines to ministries of health in countries, as well as key international, regional and national collaborating partners (e.g. civil society, foundations, donors).\nSuccessful implementation of these guidelines will be assessed by the number of countries that incorporate the contents into national hepatitis plans and guidelines. The impact of the testing guidelines will be measured by monitoring the number of persons tested and treated for chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis C infection, in accordance with targets proposed in the WHO Global health sector strategy on viral hepatitis 2016-2021  . The Guidelines Development Group recognized that the field of hepatitis diagnostics and testing is evolving rapidly, and it is anticipated that there will be a need for periodic updates.\nAn understanding of the global and regional epidemiology and burden of hepatitis B and C infection with respect to the main routes of transmission, most affected populations, and natural history and time course of serological markers is critical to inform strategies on both who to test and how to test. However, data are limited in many LMICs, particularly in the African region, due to weak surveillance systems with underreporting and therefore unreliable data. The nature of an epidemic within a specific country will determine the appropriate testing strategy and approaches1 provides an overview of the risk factors and primary routes of transmission for HBV and HCV infection in populations most affected by HBV and HCV, as well as data on seroprevalence from systematic reviews and other studies. High risk of infection through parenteral exposure, most commonly from sharing of needles and other injecting equipment.\nPrevalence rates of HBV infection among PWID similar to background population in HBV-endemic areas . Prevalence is particularly high in settings where PWID are criminalized and lack access to harm reduction services.\nNon-injecting drug use, e.g. through intranasal drug use, has been associated with a small but increased risk of HCV infection .\n\n【36】 #People in prisons and closed settings\nHigh risk of infection through parenteral exposure, most commonly from sharing of needles and razor blades and other injecting equipment, particularly when safe injecting equipment is not available .\nPotential for increased risk of sexual transmission due to unsafe sex behaviours, lack of availability of prevention hardware such as condoms, and higher risk of experiencing men-on-men sexual violence .\nDisplaced and marginalized populations may be at increased risk of sexual transmission of HBV due to increased vulnerability to sexual violence or coercion, or unsafe sex practices .\nMigrant populations represent a heterogeneous group and HCV seroprevalence estimates vary widely .\nSome marginalized mobile populations may be more likely to belong to other populations at high risk for HBV and HCV transmission, such as PWID or sex workers .\n\n【37】 #Indigenous populations\nSome indigenous populations may have higher rates of prevalence but poorer access to HBV vaccination or be more likely to belong to other high-risk populations, such as PWID .\n\n【38】 #Sex workers\nSex workers are at increased risk of sexual transmission of HBV due to exposure to multiple partners and poorer access to access safe sex materials such as condoms .\nOverall, the risk of sexual transmission of HCV is low. There may be a small, increased risk of transmission among persons with multiple sex partners.\n\n【39】 #Transgender people\nTransgender people may be at increased risk for viral hepatitis through using unsafe injecting equipment for administration of hormones or through sexual transmission ,\nIn several outbreaks of HCV infection among MSM in Europe, Australia and the US, transmission has been linked to sexual exposure as well as potentially to underreported use of injecting and non-injecting recreational drugs .\n\n【40】 #Key and priority populations\nHepatitis B Hepatitis C\n\n【41】 #Health-care workers\nThe greatest proportion of occupational transmission of viral hepatitis is due to percutaneous injury via needles during vascular access. Transmission may also occur through exposure to blood and body fluids on skin lesions and mucous membranes .\nMultiple factors contribute to higher risk of occupational acquisition in LMICs. These include: working among populations with a higher prevalence of infection, higher rates of unnecessary injections in health-care settings, use of unsterilized needles and equipment lacking a needle-stick safety mechanism, lack of implementation of standard precautions, inadequate coverage of HBV vaccination .\nAmong non-immune persons, the risk of HBV infection after percutaneous exposure ranges from less than 6% (if HBeAg negative) to 30% (if HBeAg posiitive) .\nRisk of HCV infection after percutaneous exposure estimated to be 1.8% .\n\n【42】 #Persons exposed in health-care settings\nHigh risk of parenteral transmission in settings with a higher background seroprevalence of HBV and HCV and where infection control practices are inadequate (e.g. diagnostic and therapeutic procedures), and blood transfusions and other tissue donations are not screened for viral hepatitis .\nPersons who may have multiple exposures, such as patients with thalassaemia or haemophilia who receive multiple transfusions, and patients on haemodialysis, are at higher risk .\n\n【43】 #Persons exposed via other invasive procedures\nThere is a small but increased risk of HBV and HCV transmission with other procedures where there is a risk blood-to-blood transmission via contaminated equipment, including cosmetic procedures (such as tattooing and body piercing), and traditional medicine procedures such as scarification and circumcision .\nPersons living with HIV and those living with other sexually transmitted infections (STIs)\nPersons who have been exposed to HIV or other STIs via sexual transmission may be at increased risk of sexually acquired HBV infection .\nThere is an increased risk of HCV infection among persons living with HIV .\nParticularly in high HBV and HCV-prevalence settings, children who have been exposed to HIV through mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) are at increased risk of HBV and HCV infection .\n\n【44】 #Infants born to infected mothers\nPerinatal or early childhood transmission is the main route of infection in many parts of the world, particularly in endemic countries, where 90% of CHB infections may be attributable to MTCT.\nHBV transmission in early life is associated with a much higher risk of developing chronic infection (90% in the perinatal period to 6 months of age) than acquisition later in childhood or adulthood .\nHigh prevalence in some settings such as in children treated in hospital for malignancy, renal failure requiring haemodialysis, and those who have undergone surgical procedures likely reflects iatrogenic transmission .\nThere may also be adolescents who missed out on HBV vaccination, and were infected perinatally or in early childhood.\nAdolescents who engage in early sex, have multiple sex partners, or sex partners with CHB are at increased risk .\nOverall, the risk of sexual transmission of HCV is low. However, there is a small increased risk among persons with multiple sex partners .\nVulnerable adolescents may be more likely to belong to other high-risk key populations, including PWID and sex workers, for example .\n\n【45】 #Couples, partners and household contacts\nPersons who live in the same household as a person with CHB are at increased risk of horizontal acquisition of HBV infection .\nOverall, the risk of sexual transmission of HCV is low. However, the risk is increased among persons with multiple sex partners .\nThere is no evidence to support transmission among household contacts who are not sexual partners .\n-f CHB . Overall, HBV infection accounts for around 45% of cases of HCC and 30% of cirrhosis, with much higher proportions in LMICs .\nHIV and HBV. There is an estimated global HBsAg prevalence of 74% (IQR 5.0-11.2%) in HIV-infected persons, and a burden of 2.73 million (IQR 1.8-3.9 million; IQR 13-44 million) HIV-HBsAg-coinfected persons . The highest burden for HIV-HBV coinfection is in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) (71% of all cases; 1.96 million).\n\n【46】 #Natural history of HBV infection\nHepatitis B virus is an enveloped DNA virus, and a member of the family Hepadnaviridae hepatotropic DNA viruses. Hepatitis B virus causes both acute and chronic infection that can range from asymptomatic infection or mild disease to severe or fulminant hepatitis. Acute hepatitis B is usually a self-limiting disease marked by acute inflammation and hepatocellular necrosis, with a case fatality rate of 0.5-1% . Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) encompasses a spectrum of disease, and is defined as persistent HBV infection (the presence of detectable HBsAg in the blood or serum for longer than six months), with or without associated active viral replication and evidence of hepatocellular injury and inflammation . Age is a key factor in determining the risk of chronic infection. Chronicity is common following acute infection in neonates (90% of neonates born to hepatitis B e antigen -positive mothers) and in young children under the age of 5 years (20-60%), but occurs less commonly (<5%) when infection is acquired in adulthood . Worldwide, the majority of persons with CHB were infected at birth or in early childhood.\n\n【47】 #FIG. 4.1 Outcomes of hepatitis B virus infection by age at infection\nChronic infection (%) The natural history of CHB is dynamic and complex, and progresses nonlinearly through several recognizable phases .\n\n【48】 #Time course and interpretation of serological markers of HBV infection\nA range of HBV markers other than HBsAg, such as anti-HBc total and anti-HBc IgM, HBeAg and antibodies to hepatitis B e and surface antigen (anti-HBe and anti-HBs) and HBV DNA can be used to further characterize HBV infection . When these markers are tested concurrently, a testing profile can be produced to differentiate acute from chronic infection, stage the disease and identify those who may benefit from treatment, monitor disease progression or response to antiviral treatment, as well as those who would benefit from HBV immunization or re-immunization.\nThe appearance of HBsAg in the blood is followed by that of HBeAg, which is a marker of high levels of viral replication. In acute HBV infection that resolves by itself, HBeAg seroconverts relatively early to anti-HBe with the disappearance of HBsAg and HBeAg. But in chronic HBV infection, seroconversion to anti-HBe may be delayed for many years, HBeAg may persist, or neither anti-HBe nor HBeAg may be detectable in the presence of HBsAg. Antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) may occur relatively early in the infection, often within a week or two after the appearance of HBsAg, and is typified by a profound immunoglobulin (Ig)M anti-HBc response that wanes approximately 6 months later ,Fig. 4 CHB is defined as the persistence of HBsAg for more than 6 months. Previous HBV infection is characterized by the presence of antibodies (anti-HBs and anti-HBc). Immunity to HBV infection after vaccination is characterized by the presence of only anti-HBs.\nIt also needs to be established whether the person is in the HBeAg-positive or HBeAg-negative phase of infection, though both require lifelong monitoring, as the condition may change over time. In persons with CHB, a positive HBeAg result suggests high-level HBV replication and high infectivity. Spontaneous improvement may occur following HBeAg-positive seroconversion (anti-HBe), with a decline in HBV replication, and normalization of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels. This confers a good prognosis and does not require treatment.\nFurther assessment of HBsAg-positive persons is needed to guide management and indicate the need for treatment . This generally includes assessment of additional serological markers of HBV infection (HBeAg), measuring aminotransferase levels to help determine liver inflammation, quantification of HBV DNA levels, and stage of liver fibrosis by non-invasive tests (NITs) such as transient elastography or serum biomarker-based tests such as aspartate aminotransferase (AST)-to-platelet ratio index (APRI), and fibrosis-4 (FIB-4). c A potential consequence of misinterpreting a reactive IgM anti-HBc result is that a patient with chronic HBV infection experiencing flares in liver disease may not be offered timely antiviral treatment and, although they could be re-examined several months later to confirm the original diagnosis of acute HBV infection, a substantial proportion of such patients may be lost to follow up. d 1 IU/mL = 5.3 copies/mL; 2000 IU/mL = 10 000 copies/mL; 20 000 IU/mL = 100 000 copies/mL; 200 000 IU/mL = 1 000 000 copies/mL 4.1.5. Preventing hepatitis B infection through vaccination\nVaccination of infants and, in particular, delivery of hepatitis B vaccine within 24 hours of birth is 90-95% effective in preventing infection with HBV as well as in decreasing HBV transmission if followed by at least two other doses. WHO recommends universal hepatitis B vaccination for all infants, and giving the first dose as soon as possible after birth . This strategy has resulted in a dramatic decrease in the incidence and prevalence of CHB among young children in regions of the world where universal infant vaccination programmes have been implemented . Target groups for catch-up vaccination as well as other preventive strategies include young adolescents, household and sexual contacts of persons who are HBsAg-positive, and persons at risk of acquiring HBV infection, such as PWID, MSM and persons with multiple sex partners.\n\n【49】 #Treatment of hepatitis B infection\nWHO recommends antiviral agents (tenofovir and entecavir) that are active against HBV infection and have been shown to effectively suppress HBV replication, prevent progression to cirrhosis, and reduce the risk of HCC and liver-related deaths .\nDespite the declining incidence, a large number of persons who were infected 30-60 years ago are now dying from HCV-related cirrhosis and liver cancer, as these complications often take decades to develop. According to estimates from the Global Burden of Disease study, the number of deaths due to hepatitis C increased from 333 000 in 1990 to 499 000 in 2010 and 704 000 in 2013 .\nHIV and HCV have common routes of transmission, and persons with HIV infection, in particular PWID and MSM, are at increased risk of HCV infection .\n\n【50】 #Transmission of hepatitis C infection\n1 provides an overview of the primary routes of transmission for HCV infection and populations most affected. There are four main routes of transmission: healthcare-associated transmission, injecting drug use, mother-to-child transmission (MTCT), and sexual transmission. In LMICs, infection with HCV is most commonly associated with unsafe injection practices, and invasive procedures in health-care facilities with inadequate infection control practices, such as renal dialysis and unscreened (or inadequately screened) blood transfusions (70-74, 77, 78, 119). Persons who received untested blood products prior to the introduction of screening of blood for HCV in (HICs) are also at risk, and WHO reports suggest that there are still 39 countries that do not routinely screen blood transfusions for bloodborne viruses . In middle-and high-income countries, most HCV infections occur among people who use unsterile equipment to inject drugs. PWID have a high global prevalence of infection at around 67% . Of the estimated 16 million people in 148 countries who actively inject drugs, 10 million have serological evidence of HCV infection . There is a moderate risk of MTCT of HCV which is higher in HIV-coinfected mothers (10-20%) . The risk of sexual transmission of HCV is also greater in HIV-positive persons, particularly MSM , but is low among HIV-uninfected heterosexual couples , and intranasal drug use.\nAs a result of these different routes of transmission, certain groups are at higher risk of HCV infection . The relative importance of these risk groups varies substantially, depending on the geographical location and population studied. Persons at risk for HCV infection are also likely to be at risk for infection with other bloodborne viruses, including HBV and HIV. Generally, HCV epidemics around the world are heterogeneous and represent mixtures of three core epidemic components . However, few countries have epidemics that fall into just one of these categories -most represent some combination of all components.\n1. Global epidemic patterns of HCV infection 1. Historic infection related to past generalized HCV exposures that have since been identified and removed, i.e. \"birth cohort\" epidemic. These exposures include blood transfusions and medical procedures prior to the identification of HCV, or prior to the availability of HCV diagnostic screening. Following introduction of HCV screening of the blood supply in the early 1990s, the incidence of HCV fell dramatically among the general population. However, there remains a burden of prevalent, chronic HCV infection among those exposed prior to the introduction of screening of the blood supply. This epidemic pattern, in which there is a high prevalence of HCV within a given older age group, is commonly referred to as a \"birth cohort\" epidemic . While typically identified as being the infection pattern in North America and Europe, it is likely to be a component of the HCV epidemic in many countries . In addition, some countries have other specific historical risks that reflect past medical practices or public health campaigns unique to that country, for example, the use of reusable syringes in the populationbased campaign to treat schistosomiasis in Egypt exposed a large proportion of the population to HCV.\n\n【51】 #Ongoing risk of HCV transmission reflecting current behaviours and practices\na Ongoing infection related to high-risk behaviours. In certain countries, HCV transmission occurs predominantly in high-risk populations, often via common routes of transmission. Among PWID, HCV prevalence is almost universally high ,ranging from 30% to 75% , and in many HICs, PWID drive ongoing HCV transmission. Sex workers and prisoners also have increased prevalence (presumed to be related to both drug use and perhaps sexual transmission) .\nb Ongoing infection and generalized population epidemic related to suboptimal infection control and injection safety procedures in clinical settings. This pattern is related to widespread exposure, often iatrogenic, which results in high prevalence (8-10%) across all age groups. An example of a generalized exposure is the common use of reusable hypodermic syringes and needles in medical settings without adequate sterilization between uses.\nThe primary difference between a \"birth cohort\" pattern and a generalized pattern of infection is the duration of time that the generalized exposure has existed and whether it has been removed or mitigated.\n\n【52】 #Natural history of hepatitis C infection\nHCV is a small, positive-stranded RNA-enveloped virus with multiple genotypes and subgenotypes, and their distribution varies substantially in different parts of the world (Fig. 4.4). The availability of pangenotypic DAA regimens will increasingly obviate the need for prior genotyping, which will help expand access to HCV treatment.\nHepatitis C virus causes both acute and chronic infection. Acute HCV infection is defined as the presence of certain markers of HCV infection within six months of exposure to and infection with HCV, and is characterized by the appearance of HCV RNA, HCV core antigen (p22 Ag), and subsequently HCV antibodies, which may or may not be associated with viral clearance. Antibodies to HCV develop as part of acute infection and persist throughout life. Acute infection is usually clinically silent, and is only very rarely associated with life-threatening disease. Spontaneous clearance of acute HCV infection generally occurs within six months of infection in 15-45% of infected individuals in the absence of treatment, but this varies by region and population . Antibodies to HCV develop as part of acute infection and persist throughout life. Almost all the remaining 55-85% of persons who do not clear HCV within six months are defined as having chronic HCV infection. Left untreated, chronic HCV infection can cause liver cirrhosis, liver failure and HCC. Of those with chronic HCV infection, the risk of cirrhosis of the liver is 15-30% within 20 years . The risk of HCC in persons with cirrhosis is approximately 2-4% per year (Fig. 4.5) . Clearance of infection, whether spontaneous or as a result of antiviral treatment, does not provide lasting protection from reinfection.\nDiagnosis of HCV infection currently consists of initial screening for evidence of past or current HCV infection with a serological assay, followed by NAT for HCV RNA (either quantitative or qualitative) to confirm the presence of HCV viraemia, and therefore chronic HCV infection.\n\n【53】 #Time course of serological markers for HCV infection\nThe exact time course of virological and immunological markers of HCV infection is not well defined, particularly during the first months of infection, due to differences in each host (patient) immune response, specific properties of the infecting virus, and sensitivity of assays used to determine the appearance of HCV markers. As illustrated in Fig. 4.5, following an initial eclipse phase of 1-2 weeks when no virological or serological markers of infection may be detected, the natural course of HCV infection is characterized by the appearance of HCV RNA, then HCV core p22 Ag in the absence of an antibody response for a further 6-10 weeks. During this serological window, it has been shown that free (i.e. not complexed with antibody) HCV core antigen (HCVcAg) can be detected in a proportion of individuals. Following the development of the antibody response, HCVcAg becomes complexed with these antibodies specific for HCV. Window period. Assays designed solely to detect antibodies to HCV inevitably have a window period of infectivity in early infection, during which antibodies may be undetectable. This window period can be shortened by utilizing assays that also include direct detection of HCVcAg (50-60 days). HCV RNA is typically not used to determine exposure to HCV, in spite of its short window period (1-2 weeks after the onset of acute infection) primarily because of cost . There are increasing reports of occult HCV infection, i.e. HCV RNA detectable in the absence of any serological markers (i.e. HCV seronegative)  which may be due to underlying immunosuppression in, for example, HIV-infected populations.\n\n【54】 #Prevention of hepatitis C infection\nIn the absence of a vaccine for hepatitis C, prevention of HCV infection depends upon reducing the risk of exposure to the virus. This is challenging because of the various routes of transmission and the different populations that are affected. Globally, most HCV infections occur in health-care settings as a result of inadequate infection control procedures. WHO has published guidelines with recommendations for preventing health-care-associated HCV infection, and for screening of blood products .\n\n【55】 #Treatment of hepatitis C infection\nA new class of medicines, called direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), have transformed the treatment of HCV, with regimens that can be administered for a short duration (as short as eight weeks), resulting in cure rates higher than 90%, but\n\n【56】 #A B\nare associated with fewer serious adverse events than the previous interferoncontaining regimens. WHO updated its hepatitis C treatment guidelines in 2016 to provide recommendations for the use of new DAAs  .\nThere still remains some variation in recommended HCV treatment regimens and duration of therapy by genotype. This requirement to determine a patient's genotype prior to treatment will soon change when antiviral agents that are active against all genotypes (referred to as pangenotypic) are licensed.\n\n【57】 #Types of viral hepatitis assays\nSerological assays are typically used as the first line of the testing strategy to screen for exposure to a virus because of their relatively low cost (compared to NAT), and are therefore used to rule in all individuals who might potentially be infected with HCV or HBV. Serological assays detect the host immune response (antibodies to HCV) or a viral antigen (HBsAg, HCVcAg). They are based on the immunoassay principle, and are available in the form of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) or laboratory-based enzyme immunoassays (EIAs), chemoluminescence immunoassays (CLIAs) and electrochemoluminescence immunoassays (ECLs).\nIn contrast, NAT technologies are typically used to detect the presence of the virus, determine if the infection is active and if the individual would benefit from antiviral treatment. NAT technologies are also used to determine when antiviral treatment should be discontinued (due to non-response or resistance) or to confirm virological cure (HCV) or effective suppression (HBV).\n\n【58】 #Rapid diagnostic tests\nRapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are single-use disposable assays that are provided in simple-to-use formats that generally require no additional reagents except those supplied in the test kit. They are read visually and can give a simple qualitative result in under 30 minutes. Due to their simplicity, cost and rapid turnaround time, they can be performed by trained lay providers or health-care workers, without the need for venepuncture for specimen collection. Quality-assured RDTs are therefore particularly useful in settings where conventional laboratory-based testing services are not available or accessible. They can also be used in outreach programmes (e.g. prison services, prevention and treatment services for people who use drugs).\nMost RDTs can be performed with capillary whole blood collected by a fingerstick procedure using a lancet, but many have also been developed for use with venous whole blood, serum or plasma. Certain ones have been validated for use with oral fluid specimens, Rapid tests are generally not suitable for testing large numbers of blood samples. The reading of results is dependent on subjective evaluation and no permanent record of the original test results can be kept.\n\n【59】 #Laboratory-based immunoassays\nMost laboratory-based serological immunoassays (EIAs, CLIAs and ECLs) detect antibodies, antigens or a combination of both and differ only in the mode of detection of immune complexes formed. A cut-off value, usually determined by the manufacturer of the assay, specifies the point at which the results are considered to be reactive, and therefore, EIA results are generally reported as optical density divided by the assay cut-off (OD/CO) values. These types of assays are best suited for and most cost-effective to perform in settings with a high throughput of specimens (in excess of 40 per day). They are meant for laboratory-or facilitybased testing rather than for use in the community, where infrastructure (electricity, cold storage, climate-controlled rooms) and skilled staff are consistently available, as cold-chain storage of test kits and the use of precision pipettes are usually required. These assays are typically used only with serum or plasma specimens, and therefore require phlebotomy to collect an appropriate specimen.\nThese assays may be performed either manually or on non-dedicated automated assay or specific dedicated automated systems. Simple immunoanalysers automate a number of the processes and as such require less hands-on time than a manually run EIA. They can therefore be used in range of different situations from high-throughput laboratories for the screening of large numbers of samples with full automation, to medium-sized laboratories with semi-automation, to small laboratories, such as those in remote areas, which conduct a small number of tests manually.\n\n【60】 #Confirmatory assays\nFor HBsAg -neutralization assays are used to confirm if observed antigen reactivity is neutralizable upon repeat testing with the same specimen using a neutralization step in the laboratory-based immunoassays, with a specific anti-HBs-containing reagent in the same assay. The result is confirmed when this neutralization reagent can abolish reactivity in the assay in comparison with a control reaction.\n\n【61】 #Nucleic acid testing technologies\nThese assays detect the presence of viral nucleic acid -DNA or RNA -through targeting a specific segment of the virus, which is then amplified. The amplification step enables the detection of low levels of the virus in the original specimen, which might not otherwise have been detectable. Laboratory-based technologies for NAT require sophisticated equipment, rigorous laboratory conditions and specimen collection, and highly trained staff who can perform precision steps and avoid contamination. Not all NAT technologies detect all genotypes or subtypes equally well, unless they are optimized to do so. Newly developed NAT technologies that are simpler and more robust are intended for use at or near the point of care, and may avoid some of the logistical and technical disadvantages of laboratory-based NAT technologies.\nIn addition to NAT assays that target a single virus, multiplex NAT screening assays have been developed, which can detect DNA or RNA from multiple viruses simultaneously.\n\n【62】 #Choice of serological assays\n1 describes the advantages and disadvantages of RDTs and laboratorybased immunoassays. The choice of assay format will depend on a variety of factors, most importantly, performance characteristics (sensitivity and specificity), cost, ease of use and the characteristics of the testing site, such as storage facilities, infrastructure, and level of staff skills\n\n【63】 #Selection of one-or two-assay serological testing strategy\nA testing strategy defines the sequence of tests to be followed for a specific testing objective (i.e. to identify infected and non-infected individuals), taking into consideration the anticipated prevalence of HBsAg or HCV antibody in the population(s) to be tested. WHO recommends the use of standardized testing strategies to both maximize the accuracy of HBsAg or HCV antibody testing while simplifying the process through streamlining procurement and training . The choice between a one-assay versus two-assay serological testing strategy will depend on the seroprevalence in the population to be tested and diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) of the assays used,\nOne-assay serological testing strategy A one-assay serological testing strategy (Fig. 5.1) is when a single serological test is performed. If the test result is reactive, a \"compatible with positive infection\" status is reported. If the initial test result is non-reactive, a \"negative infection\" status is reported. This testing strategy efficiently rules out most uninfected individuals correctly, and rules in those who are likely to be infected and therefore in need of further HBV DNA and HCV RNA NAT testing and staging of liver disease using NITs and clinical evaluation. This testing strategy is particularly suitable for highprevalence settings due to the relatively higher positive predictive values (PPVs), but needs a highly sensitive and specific assay to maintain acceptable predictive values.\nTwo-assay serological testing strategy Two-assay serological testing strategy (Fig. 5.2) differs in that two different assays are used sequentially, to improve the PPV of the testing strategy, and so reduce the number of individuals inappropriately referred on to more specialist services. This can be achieved by either (i) repeating the serological test using a different assay of similar sensitivity, or (ii) in the case of HBsAg, performing a neutralization test using a specific anti-HBs-containing reagent in the same firstline assay after appropriate dilution of the specimen under test.\nIf the first test result is non-reactive, a \"negative infection\" status is reported.\nIf both test results are reactive, the status is reported as: \"presumptive positive status infection for further diagnostic testing\". If the second test result is nonreactive, the status is reported as \"infection inconclusive; requires additional testing\". If the second assay is less sensitive than the first, then it is likely that some true positives would be discarded if negative on the second test.  4. In all settings, screening of blood donors should be mandatory with linkage to care, counselling and treatment for those who test positive.\nAbbreviations: HBsAg: hepatitis B surface antigen; PWID: people who inject drugs; MSM: men who have sex with men The GRADE system (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) was used to categorize the strength of recommendations as strong or conditional (based on consideration of the quality of evidence, balance of benefits and harms, acceptability, resource use and programmatic feasibility) and the quality of evidence as high, moderate, low or very low.\n\n【64】 #Focused testing in most affected populations\n- In all settings (and regardless of whether delivered through facility-or communitybased testing), it is recommended that serological testing for HCV antibody (anti-HCV) 1 be offered with linkage to prevention, care and treatment services to the following individuals:\n- Adults and adolescents from populations most affected by HCV infection 2 (i.e. who are either part of a population with high HCV seroprevalence or who have a history of exposure and/or high-risk behaviours for HCV infection); - Adults, adolescents and children with a clinical suspicion of chronic viral hepatitis 3 (i.e. symptoms, signs, laboratory markers).\n\n【65】 #Strong recommendation, low quality of evidence\nNote: Periodic re-testing using HCV NAT should be considered for those with ongoing risk of acquisition or reinfection.\n\n【66】 #General population testing\n- In settings with a ≥2% or ≥5% 4 HCV antibody seroprevalence in the general population, it is recommended that all adults have access to and be offered HCV serological testing with linkage to prevention, care and treatment services. General population testing approaches should make use of existing community-or facility-based testing opportunities or programmes such as HIV or TB clinics, drug treatment services and antenatal clinics 5.\n\n【67】 #Conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence\nBirth cohort testing 3. This approach may be applied to specific identified birth cohorts of older persons at higher risk of infection 6 and morbidity within populations that have an overall lower general prevalence.\n\n【68】 #Conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence\nAbbreviations: NAT: nucleic acid test; anti-HCV: HCV antibody; PWID: people who inject drugs; MSM: men who have sex with men The GRADE system (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) was used to categorize the strength of recommendations as strong or conditional (based on consideration of the quality of evidence, balance of benefits and harms, acceptability, resource use and programmatic feasibility) and the quality of evidence as high, moderate, low or very low.\n\n【69】 #Different hepatitis testing approaches\nThere are several possible approaches to testing for HBV and HCV infection.\n- General population testing. This approach refers to routine testing throughout the entire population without attempting to identify high-risk behaviours or characteristics. It means that all members of the population should have potential access to the testing services. This approach might be indicated for those countries with an intermediate or high HBV or HCV seroprevalence. At present, only Japan recommends HCV testing for all individuals once in their lives regardless of demographics or specific behavioural risk.\n\n【70】 #Focused or targeted testing of specific high-risk groups.\nThis approach refers to testing of specific populations who are most affected by hepatitis B or C infection, either because they are part of a population with high HBV or HCV seroprevalence (such as some migrant populations and some indigenous populations), or have a high risk of acquisition because of risk behaviours and/or exposures. This includes PWID, people in prisons and other closed settings, MSM and sex workers, HIV-infected persons, partners or family members of infected persons, and health-care workers. It may also involve testing on the basis of clinical suspicion of viral hepatitis (i.e. symptoms, signs or abnormal liver function tests or ultrasound scan).\n\n【71】 #Routine antenatal clinic (ANC) testing.\nThis means routine testing of pregnant women especially in settings where there is an intermediate or high seroprevalence, to identify women in need of antiviral treatment for their own health and additional interventions to reduce MTCT of viral hepatitis.\n\n【72】 #\"Birth cohort\" testing.\nThis approach means routine testing among easily identified age or demographic groups (i.e. specific \"birth cohorts\") known to have high HCV prevalence due to past generalized exposures that have since been identified and removed. General one-time screening among this population avoids the need to identify risk behaviour.\nMost countries have at least some component of a \"birth cohort\" epidemic profile for HCV. Use of a birth cohort approach to HCV testing is currently recommended only in the United States.\n- Blood donor screening. WHO already recommends universal blood donor screening for viral hepatitis in order to prevent transmission of bloodborne viruses to the recipient . However, at present, this is rarely accompanied by the HBsAg-or HCV antibody -positive donors being informed of this positive result, counselled and linked to care for clinical evaluation and treatment .\nService delivery of testing approaches (health facility-or community-based)\nThe testing approaches described above can be offered and delivered using both healthfacility and/or community-based testing services.\nHealth-facility-based testing includes primary care clinics, inpatient wards and outpatient clinics, including specialist dedicated clinics such as HIV, STI and TB clinics, in district and provincial or regional hospitals as well as their laboratories, and in private clinical services.\nCommunity-based testing can be offered and delivered using outreach (mobile) approaches in general and key populations; home-based testing (or door-to-door outreach); testing in workplaces, places of worship, parks, bars and other venues; in schools and other educational establishments; as well as through campaigns (e.g. screening for HIV or malaria alongside that for noncommunicable diseases such as diabetes and hypertension). Although many of these approaches were developed to increase the coverage and impact of HIV testing , they are equally applicable to the delivery of hepatitis testing.\n\n【73】 #Summary of the evidence\nThe evidence base for different HBV testing approaches (general population or focused testing) remains very limited, especially in LMICs, and relies largely on observational data and modelling. Although there are descriptive data showing that focused testing can increase the uptake of HBV testing, and detection rate of CHB cases, data showing impact on patient-important outcomes are limited . There is also a lack of evidence on and uncertainty regarding how successful focused testing is in reaching specific populations. For these reasons, a formal systematic review of the impact and cost-effectiveness of different testing approaches was precluded, and an updated narrative review of evidence was undertaken. The overall quality of evidence was therefore rated as low.\nThere were 32 published studies of which nine studies met the inclusion criteria -all but one study were from HICs with low HBV prevalence . Two studies evaluated the cost-effectiveness of offering testing and treatment to the general population (one from the United States  and the other from west Africa ), and seven studies had examined targeted riskgroup testing in migrant populations  or \"high-risk\" groups .\nSeveral studies were based on modelling simulations using hypothetical data. Various outcome measures were used, including cost per quality-adjusted lifeyear (QALY) gained, cost per life-year (LY) saved and cost per case tested.\nGeneral population testing. The two studies performed in the United States and West Africa showed that offering HBsAg testing to the general population with provision of antiviral treatment in those eligible is cost-effective in both high-income  and low-income settings  even down to a population prevalence as low as 0.3% and 1.5%, respectively. In addition, the feasibility of large-scale testing and treatment in sub-Saharan Africa based on real-world cost and effectiveness data was demonstrated by the PROLIFICA (Prevention of Liver Fibrosis and Liver Cancer in Africa) study in west Africa . This study screened almost 10 000 adults for HBsAg using an active outreach method at the community level in the Gambia and Senegal, followed by full clinical assessment of those found HBsAg positive, and provision of antiviral treatment if they met eligibility criteria. They showed this community-based screen-and-treat strategy was cost-effective compared to the status quo.\nFocused risk-based testing. Testing and treatment of migrant or refugee populations in HICs was also found to be a cost-effective intervention in seven studies from Canada, the United States and Europe .\n\n【74】 #6A TESTING APPROACHES TO DETECT CHRONIC HEPATITIS B\nPregnant women. Although the cost-effectiveness of HBsAg testing of pregnant women in ANC to reduce MTCT and benefits to the child has been addressed in several studies, there were none identified that considered interventions and antiviral treatment for the benefit of the mother to reduce her risk of progression of liver disease.\nDrivers of cost-effectiveness. These analyses identified several key drivers of cost-effectiveness for countries to consider when planning testing approaches. These include: (i) Drug and testing costs. The key driver of the cost-effectiveness of a test-and-treat strategy reported is the cost of the antiviral drug  in any of the studies. However, this does not imply that high participation levels in screening are not important. The implication of this result is that it is likely to be worthwhile performing screening and providing treatment, even if participation in screening may be low, in part because testing costs are low relative to the costs and health benefits of treatment for those who are infected. HBsAg prevalence also had a relatively small influence on cost-effectiveness across a wide range of prevalence levels examined.\n\n【75】 #Rationale for the recommendations on testing approaches for HBV infection\nIn developing recommendations on which populations to test and what testing approaches to use, the Guidelines Development Group first considered the primary goals of testing : (i) to identify those in greatest need of treatment to reduce morbidity and mortality from HBV-related chronic liver disease; (ii) to reduce the risk of acquisition of disease, by vaccinating those who do not have HBV infection but remain at risk; and (iii) to reduce the risk of mother-to-child vertical transmission and so have benefits that extend beyond the person tested to others. These considerations were then balanced with the need for recommendations that are feasible and implementable by health programmes in LMICs.\nOverall, there was a very limited evidence base for the impact of different testing approaches (general population or focused high-risk) as well as for different settings (community-versus health facility-based). Therefore, recommendations were formulated based on consideration of evidence mainly from cost-effectiveness analyses together with data on HBsAg seroprevalence in different settings and populations, and in the general population with considerations of feasibility and cost. The caveats of extrapolating costeffectiveness data from HICs to LMICs were recognized. The Guidelines Development Group recommended the use of three key testing approaches: routine testing in the general population; focused testing in most affected populations because of higher-risk behaviours or exposures; and routine ANC testing. These can be implemented both in health-care facilities and in the community, as appropriate to the local epidemiology and context.\n\n【76】 #Balance of benefits and harms\nGeneral population testing. In settings where there is an HBsAg prevalence ≥2% in the general population, focused testing in higher-risk populations alone will be insufficient to identify many of those infected and in need of treatment. Additional general population testing approaches that use community-as well as health facility-based testing programmes are therefore needed to increase the coverage and impact of HBV testing. Although general population testing was estimated to be cost-effective down to prevalence levels <1%, the Guidelines Development Group proposed a higher threshold of ≥2% to reflect the wellaccepted thresholds for defining intermediate (≥2%)/high (≥5%) seroprevalence . The Guidelines Development Group recognized that the threshold used by countries will depend on other country considerations and epidemiological context. For this reason, a conditional recommendation was made.\nFocused risk-based testing in populations with high-risk behaviour or exposure to HBV infection. Certain populations are well recognized to be at high risk of acquisition and transmission of HBV infection , and therefore should be prioritized for testing in all epidemic settings. These include people living with HIV, PWID, MSM, sex workers, people in prisons and other closed settings, some mobile/migrant populations from high/intermediate-endemic countries, some indigenous populations, children born to HBsAg-positive mothers, especially if they did not receive timely infant vaccination, and other family members, sexual partners and close household contacts of those with HBV infection; and health-care workers. In high-endemic settings, a clinically guided testing approach among adults and children with a clinical suspicion of chronic viral hepatitis (i.e. clinical symptoms or signs, or abnormal liver function tests or ultrasound scan) will identify a larger proportion of infected persons.\n\n【77】 #Key benefits of focused testing\n- Focused testing in health facilities can successfully increase the uptake of viral hepatitis testing, case detection rate, and referrals to specialist-level care and other important services.\n- Focused testing of high-prevalence populations or of those in settings where there is a large proportion of such persons (e.g. harm reduction and drug treatment services for PWID) or a clinically guided approach based on clinical suspicion is likely to be associated with higher rates of case-finding. This approach will generally be cost-effective compared to generalized testing, especially in low-and concentratedepidemic settings.\n- It is recognized that many high HBV-prevalence countries currently lack the resources to undertake general population screening, and therefore focused risk-based testing may be more readily feasible and cost-effective, particularly if it makes use of existing health-facility infrastructure and staff.\nDespite the limited formal evaluation of focused testing in high-risk groups and low quality of evidence, a strong recommendation was made because of the overall benefits of focused testing approaches.\n\n【78】 #Pregnant women -routine testing in antenatal clinics. The Guidelines Development\nGroup strongly recommended routine HBsAg testing in ANC, despite limited or low-quality evidence, for several reasons.\nTo benefit their offspring through interventions to significantly reduce MTCT of HBV infection . This is because in high-prevalence, resource-limited settings, HBV is mainly transmitted through MTCT and early childhood horizontal transmissions.\nInfants born to HBV-infected mothers are at high risk for both acquisition of HBV infection and development of chronic infection (90%). Therefore, key interventions in this group could significantly reduce the burden of disease in the long term.\nAlthough a systematic review of cost-effectiveness studies on routine antenatal testing in LMICs was not undertaken, this would likely be cost-effective, since testing of mothers for HBV infection has benefits for both the child (reduced transmission) and mother (reduced morbidity).\nThere is already universal HIV testing in ANC which has proved feasible and acceptable in many countries .\nCouples and partner testing in ANC. HIV testing of the partners of women attending ANC is now a focus in 21 priority countries aiming for elimination of MTCT (eMTCT) of HIV. Since these countries are also all highly endemic for HBV, this provides a unique opportunity to integrate concurrent HBV testing for partners of women with CHB, or chronic HCV infection if risk factors are present, despite the lack of specific evidence for couples and partner testing for hepatitis in ANC.\nBlood donor screening. WHO already recommends blood donor screening for HBV, HCV, HIV and syphilis in order to prevent transmission of bloodborne viruses to the recipient . However, this is rarely accompanied by the HBsAg or HCV antibody positive donor being informed of this positive result, counselled and linked into care for clinical evaluation and treatment . As part of the PROLIFICA study in west Africa, in addition to HBsAg testing and treatment in the community, blood donors who had tested HBsAg positive at the blood bank were linked to specialist care . A higher proportion of blood donors were HBsAg positive and requiring treatment, but had a lower rate of linkage to care. Although a formal cost-effectiveness analysis was not done, these factors are likely to make testing, linkage and treatment of blood donors even more cost-effective compared to community-based testing. However, as blood donors constitute only a small fraction of the population, this strategy is likely to be limited in its reach and population-level effectiveness, and probably should be seen as a complementary, rather than an alternative to a wider screening strategy.\n\n【79】 #Acceptability, values and preferences\nA values and preferences survey of 104 stakeholders from 43 (20 high-income, 23 lowand middle-income) countries provided additional strong support for testing of specific populations: blood donors (>85%), children born to HBV-infected mothers (75%), persons living with HIV (65%), pregnant women (78%), MSM (45%), sex workers (45%), prisoners (25%) and those chronically ill (around 25%). General population testing for HBV infection was supported by only one third of respondents.\n\n【80】 #Summary of the evidence\nA systematic review and meta-analysis of the impact and cost-effectiveness of different HCV testing approaches (general population or focused testing) was precluded by the limited number of available studies and because of the heterogeneity of settings and populations studied and outcomes measured. Therefore, a narrative review was undertaken in different settings, alongside consideration of recent systematic reviews of HCV seroprevalence in different populations. The three main testing approaches evaluated were (i) routine testing throughout the entire population; (ii) focused or targeted testing of the highest-risk groups; and (iii) routine testing among specific birth cohorts. The overall quality of evidence was rated as low.\nOverall, there were 31 relevant studies based on a previously published systematic review  and 12 additional studies identified in an updated search  . The majority of studies were from Europe or the US, and very few from LMICs. Fourteen studies evaluated testing in the general population ,125,; 13 in PWID and STD clinics ; three in recipients of blood transfusions .\nFocused testing. Focused testing of PWID, people in prisons or closed settings and HIV-infected MSM was shown to be cost-effective in all settings , cost-effectiveness was dependent on appropriate linkage to effective therapy and retention in care.\n\"Birth-cohort\" testing. Most countries have at least some component of a \"birth cohort\" HCV epidemic (i.e. of easily identified age or demographic groups known to have a higher HCV prevalence), and several cost-effectiveness studies from the US and Portugal show that birth cohort testing is cost effective when compared to riskbased screening or current testing approaches .\nRoutine testing in the general population. A major limitation of existing cost-effectiveness studies of testing in the general population is that they were conducted based on the use of interferon-based regimens and not using the new\n\n【81】 #6B TESTING APPROACHES TO DETECT CHRONIC HEPATITIS C\nDAA curative treatments, and in HICs .\nDrivers of cost-effectiveness. In all analyses, the cost-effectiveness of testing for HCV was most sensitive to variations in prevalence, treatment efficacy (i.e. the replacement of IFN/RBV with significantly improved efficacy of DAAs), progression rates from chronic HCV to cirrhosis, and levels of linkage to care and treatment . It was relatively insensitive to costs of screening and treatment.\nBased on this narrative review of heterogeneous studies of cost-effectiveness of testing approaches from HICs, the overall quality of evidence was rated as low.\n\n【82】 #Rationale for the recommendations on testing approaches for HCV infection\nThe Guidelines Development Group recognized that HCV epidemics around the world are heterogeneous but are largely represented by mixtures of three main epidemic patterns for which a specific testing approach is appropriate. These are as follows:\n- Infection related to high-risk behaviours -requiring focused or targeted testing in the highest-risk groups;\n- Infection related to past generalized exposures that have since been identified and removed (i.e. \"birth cohort epidemic\") -requiring routine testing among specific birth cohorts that are readily identified and that have a high prevalence of HCV infection;\n- Generalized population epidemic with high prevalence generally related to a widespread, often iatrogenic, exposure -requiring routine testing throughout the entire population.\nFew countries have epidemics that fall into one of the above three profiles. Rather, the majority have mixed epidemic profiles, with some combination of all these components. Determining the optimal strategic mix of HCV testing approaches to increase the diagnosis rate, and in particular, the approach to testing outside of high-risk risk groups will depend on a country's unique HCV epidemic profile .\nThe lack of evidence from LMICs on evaluation of different testing approaches was noted.\nTesting in high-risk behaviour groups and in settings with a large proportion of patients such as PWID, MSM, prisoners, HIV-infected persons and commercial sex workers was cost-effective in all settings. The best approach to testing outside of high-risk risk groups depends on a country's unique HCV epidemiology. Most countries have at least some component of a \"birth cohort\" epidemic, and \"birth cohort\" testing is likely to be cost-effective in most settings. In most epidemic settings, routine screening of the entire population may not be cost-effective.\n\n【83】 #Balance of benefits and harms\nFocused risk-based testing. The Guidelines Development Group considered that those specific populations at the highest risk of acquisition and transmission of HCV such as PWID, people in prisons and other closed settings, MSM and sex workers should be prioritized for testing, as this was both cost-effective and had a high yield of case-finding.\nIn settings with a high prevalence, this also means focused testing of adults and children with a clinical suspicion of chronic viral hepatitis infection (i.e. clinical symptoms or signs of cirrhosis or HCC, or abnormal liver function tests or ultrasound scan). Other higher-risk groups for focused testing include persons who have had tattoos, body piercing or scarification, unsafe medical procedures, received blood products in countries where screening of blood is not carried out routinely, as well as partners and close contacts of people with HCV infection. The Guidelines Development Group recognized that the priority groups will differ across countries and settings, and that it will be important to ensure adequate linkage to care after diagnosis.\nChildren. The Guidelines Development Group also considered that screening was indicated for children born to mothers with HCV infection (especially if also HIV infected) because of an increased risk for MTCT after 18 months of age.\n\n【84】 #Key benefits of focused testing\n- Focused testing in health facilities can successfully increase the uptake of viral hepatitis testing, case detection rate, and referral to specialist-level care and other key services.\n- Focused testing of these populations can be offered in high-prevalence settings such as harm reduction and drug treatment services for PWID. Other existing opportunities for health-facility -based testing can also be used (e.g. dedicated HIV, STI and TB outpatient clinics, and other primary care, outpatient and inpatient settings), as well as testing in the community.\n- A clinically guided testing approach is also likely to identify a larger proportion of people with HCV in highly endemic settings and therefore result in a lower cost per positive person found.\nRisks of focused testing. Although ascertaining high-risk behaviours is a very effective way of identifying persons for testing, many people are unwilling to admit to stigmatizing behaviours, and health-care providers are also reluctant to ask (or have too limited time). As a result, medical records capture this information poorly, as the use of electronic medical records to flag high-risk persons for testing is limited.\nBirth-cohort testing. The best approach to testing outside of groups with high risk behaviour or exposure depends on a country's unique HCV epidemiology. For example, in many settings, unsafe injection practices will probably have more of an impact on HCV prevalence than illicit injecting drug use. The Guidelines Development Group concluded that whenever there is an easily identified demographic group that has a high HCV prevalence (e.g. all individuals born in a certain time period), routine testing for HCV within that cohort, i.e. \"birth cohort\" testing will likely be cost-effective and should be considered. This will largely apply to those countries where routine screening of the blood supply for HCV in the 1990s and improvements in injection safety practices have since removed the exposure risk. A conditional recommendation was made mainly because of low quality of evidence.\n\n【85】 #Key benefits of birth cohort testing\n- Recent studies in the US showed birth cohort screening to be cost-effective when compared with risk-based screening. While typically identified as being the infection pattern in North America and Europe, many countries have at least some component of \"birth cohort\" epidemic in their HCV epidemiology, and therefore \"birth cohort\" testing is likely to be cost-effective in most settings.\nA key advantage of this generally one-off screening approach is that it avoids the need to identify specific behavioural risks as the basis for screening, because providers may not be skilled at identifying high-risk behaviours, and individuals may not remember that they received a blood product, or report to previous risk-taking behaviour on direct questioning.\n\n【86】 #Key risks of birth cohort testing.\nMore recent data suggest that a significant proportion of the HCV-infected population is not captured as part of birth cohort screening . A further challenge is that this approach requires reliable data on both the age distribution of the population and prevalence according to age, which is not available in most countries.\nGeneral population testing. Routine screening for HCV in the general population was generally not considered cost-effective outside specific settings with high general population prevalence. The application of a one-off birth cohort screening approach to testing the general population will be more widely applicable. Therefore, a conditional recommendation was made to support consideration of general population testing in intermediate-and high-prevalence settings.\n\n【87】 #Acceptability, values and preferences\nA values and preferences survey of 104 stakeholders from 43 (20 high-income, 23 low-and middle-income) countries identified the following target populations as priority for hepatitis C testing: blood donors (>85%), children born to HCV-infected mothers (55%), persons living with HIV (50%), pregnant women (40%), MSM (25%), prisoners (25%), sex workers (<10%), and those chronically ill (25%). General population testing for HCV infection was supported by 30% of respondents.\nThe Guidelines Development Group recommended the use of various health facility or community-based testing opportunities in the general population or focused on high-risk groups because of the overall benefits of these testing approaches. However, this was conditional because of the currently limited evidence base.\n\n【88】 #Benefits of community-based testing\n- There is some evidence that the offer of HBsAg testing in community settings may increase the acceptance and uptake of testing, and rates of early diagnosis .\n- The benefits of community-based testing to access the general population are that it can also reach first-time testers and people who seldom use clinical services or are unlikely to go to a facility. This particularly includes those from key and vulnerable populations in all settings , but also those who are asymptomatic.\n- Community-based focused testing of high-risk groups. Innovative models of care have been developed and effectively implemented in many settings to provide integrated HIV  and hepatitis testing, and opioid substitution therapy (OST) services for PWID in community drug treatment services. Many of these programmes provide additional interventions, including education, harm reduction, mental health services, other general medical services, and referrals to care and treatment . These models can provide a framework for lowerincome countries to expand viral hepatitis testing and treatment for at-risk populations.\n\n【89】 #Risks of community-based testing. Key challenges encountered in delivering community-based\nHIV testing include ensuring the availability and accessibility of prevention, care and treatment services; and risks associated with potential lack of confidentiality in these settings, and associated stigmatization and discrimination. These will need to be addressed while delivering communitybased hepatitis testing.\n\n【90】 #Costs and cost-effectiveness\nCommunity-level screening with outreach components is one of the most active types of casefinding; and therefore also one of the most labour-and resource intensive . A US-based study reported that costs per person tested ranged from $40 up to $280 for programmes with more active outreach strategies . The only cost-effectiveness analysis of a community-based test-and-treat strategy from an LMIC setting in west Africa showed that a community-based test and treat approach (compared to the status quo) can be regarded as cost-effective .\nThe feasibility in sub-Saharan Africa of large-scale community-level outreach testing, clinical assessment and antiviral treatment if meeting eligibility criteria, has been demonstrated by the PROLIFICA study in west Africa .\n\n【91】 #Rationale for the recommendations on facilitybased testing Balance of benefits and harms\nTesting for viral hepatitis in the populations most affected in health-care facilities or clinical settings provides a major opportunity to scale up hepatitis testing.\n\n【92】 #Benefits of facility-based testing\n- Facility-based testing for hepatitis B and C can be successfully integrated with other health services such as HIV testing and treatment, which can in turn provide an entry point for other treatment services.\n\n【93】 #Risks of facility-based testing.\nIn low-prevalence settings, routine health facility -based testing will most likely be cost-effective only if delivered to high-risk populations.\nMultiple studies have shown that HIV testing is feasible both in health-care and other clinical facilities such as harm reduction and drug treatment services for PWID , in TB and STI clinics (and other services), with a high uptake of testing, and has been widely implemented in developed countries. In a similar way to HIV testing, hepatitis testing can be integrated with other health services and offered as part of the package of care, either routinely to all those attending services or offered in particular clinical settings.\n\n【94】 #Costs and cost-effectiveness\nIntegrating screening into existing clinical services was shown to be the least costly method of testing, but also reached the least people, whereas extending screening outside the clinical setting was more costly as it included costs of organizing events and volunteer time, but reached more people .\nFacility-based provider-initiated testing for HIV has been widely accepted in the context of testing in antenatal and TB clinic settings, as well as in drug treatment programmes . These clinics can in addition provide an entry point to services for viral hepatitis testing, prevention and care, which is likely to be acceptable to patients attending these clinics. It also can help normalize testing and remove the potential embarrassment of clients asking for a test, and saves time for clients attending clinical services for other reasons.\n\n【95】 #Implementation considerations for HBV and HCV testing approaches\n- Determining the optimal strategic mix of HBV and HCV testing approaches to increase the diagnosis rate, and in particular, the approach to testing outside of high-risk risk groups will depend on a country's epidemic profile.\n\n【96】 #Research gaps in HBV and HCV testing approaches\nFurther evaluation and comparisons of different HBV and HCV testing approaches are needed (i.e. routine general population, focused risk-based, ANC, birth cohort testing) using different service delivery models (community-or health-facility -based). This can take the form of comparative trials, or large-scale implementation studies in a range of epidemic settings and populations in LMICs. Further research into the simplification of testing and care, and integration of hepatitis services with other health services is needed. Testing of exposed infants is problematic within the first six months of life as HBsAg and hepatitis B DNA may be inconsistently detectable in infected infants. Exposed infants should be tested for HBsAg between 6 and 12 months of age to screen for evidence of hepatitis B infection. In all age groups, acute HBV infection can be confirmed by the presence of HBsAg and IgM anti-HBc. CHB is diagnosed if there is persistence of HBsAg for six months or more. 2 Laboratory-based immunoassays include enzyme immunoassay (EIA), chemoluminescence immunoassay (CLIA), and electrochemoluminescence assay (ECL). 3 Assays should meet minimum acceptance criteria of either WHO prequalification of in vitro diagnostics (IVDs) or a stringent regulatory review for IVDs. All IVDs should be used in accordance with manufacturers' instructions for use and where possible at testing sites enrolled in a national or international external quality assessment scheme. 4 Based on results of predictive modelling of positive predictive values according to different thresholds of seroprevalence in populations to be tested, and assay diagnostic performance. 5 A repeat HBsAg assay after 6 months is also a common approach used to confirm chronicity of HBV infection.\n\n【97】 #HOW TO TEST FOR CHRONIC HBV INFECTION AND MONITOR TREATMENT RESPONSE Topic Recommendations\nWhich serological assays to use\nTesting to determine chronic HBV infection is conducted using serological assays, either RDTs or EIAs that detect HBsAg. Confirmation of the presence of HBsAg may be carried out by performing either a neutralization step in the same assay, or by repeating HBsAg testing using a different assay of similar sensitivity (i.e. two-assay serological testing strategy). The choice of which format of serological assays to use will depend on a variety of factors, such as the performance criteria of the test (sensitivity and specificity), cost, ease of use and the characteristics of the testing site, such as storage facilities, infrastructure, and level of staff skills.\ntaking into consideration the anticipated prevalence of HBsAg in the population1.6 for a background on one-and two-assay serological testing strategies. The choice between a one-versus two-assay serological testing strategy will depend on the HBsAg prevalence in the population as well as diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) of the HBsAg assays used.\nA one-assay serological testing strategy (Fig. 7.1A) is when a single serological test is performed. If the test result is reactive, a \"compatible with HBsAg-positive\" status is reported. If the initial test result is non-reactive, an \"HBsAg-negative\" status is reported. The addition of a second serological test with a two-assay serological testing strategy (Fig. 7.1B) will generally improve the PPV (i.e. the proportion of individuals detected that actually have HBV infection), reduce the number of false-positive results and therefore the number of individuals inappropriately referred on to specialist services.\n\n【98】 #Summary of the evidence\nWhich serological assay to use  ,214,223. A mixture of serum, plasma, capillary and venous whole blood specimens were used for RDTs, but only serum or plasma was used for EIAs. Seven studies assessed performance using capillary or venous whole blood . Sample size varied from 25 to 3928, and populations studied included healthy volunteers and blood donors, at-risk populations, pregnant women, incarcerated adults, and patients with confirmed hepatitis B.\nRDTs. In 30 studies Analytical sensitivity/limit of detection. The analytical sensitivity or limit of detection (LoD) is another important performance criteria, but there were insufficient data in the included studies to undertake a systematic comparison. However, no RDTs met the levels of analytical sensitivity (i.e. LoD of 0.130 IU/mL) required by the European Union through its Common Technical Specifications. Data from WHO prequalification assessment studies indicate that the LoD of EIAs for HBsAg was 50-100-fold better compared to RDTs . However, despite this difference in analytical sensitivity, clinical sensitivity is unlikely to be greatly reduced because the vast majority of chronic HBV infection is associated with blood HBsAg concentrations well over 10 IU/mL. This is important, as it has been suggested that false-negative RDTs for HBsAg are due to low HBsAg viral load levels, the presence of HBsAg mutants or specific genotypes, and the use of lamivudine-or tenofovir-based ART regimens .\nThe overall quality of the evidence for the recommendation of which serological assay to use was rated as low to moderate, with downgrading mainly due to serious risk of bias based on cross-sectional study design, and heterogeneity in results.\n\n【99】 #Which testing strategy to use\nNo studies were identified that directly compared the diagnostic accuracy of a one-versus two-assay serological testing strategy in high-and low-prevalence settings . A predictive modelling analysis was therefore undertaken, which examined diagnostic accuracy of a one-or two-assay strategy based on a hypothetical population of 1000 individuals across both a range of HBsAg seroprevalence levels (10%, 2%, 0.4% representing typical high-, medium-and low-seroprevalence settings or populations, respectively) and a range of assay performance characteristics ,sensitivity of 98% and 90%, and specificity of 99% and 98% derived from the systematic review pooled sensitivity and specificity for HBsAg RDTs.\nPrevalence had a strong impact on the PPV and the ratio of true-positive to false-positive results . The introduction of a second assay of similar sensitivity to be applied to all specimens reactive in the initial serological assay provides substantial potential gains in the PPV across all prevalence levels (>97%), but particularly at a low prevalence (0.4%) and with an assay that has a lower specificity.\nThe overall quality of the evidence for the recommendation on use of a one-or two-assay serological testing strategy was rated as low, as this was based on predictive modelling simulation and hypothetical scenarios.\n\n【100】 #Rationale for the recommendations on which assay to use\nThe Guidelines Development Group recognized the critical need to expand testing to identify as many persons as possible with chronic HBV infection who might benefit the most from antiviral treatment and other interventions, and therefore made strong recommendations for a simplified one-assay testing strategy using either EIA or RDTs. Overall, the selection of assay format (EIA 3 or RDT) to test for HBsAg in a particular setting will depend first on the performance characteristics of the assay, but also on key operational considerations, such as accessibility, cost, ease of use in the intended-use setting i.e. technical complexity of test procedure and specimen collection methods. The most sensitive assay available, either RDT or EIA, in terms of clinical sensitivity, should be used.\n\n【101】 #Balance of benefits and harms\nUse of EIAs. In settings where existing laboratory testing infrastructure is available and there is good access to laboratory services, EIAs were recommended as the preferred testing method for several reasons:\n\n【102】 In HIV-infected individuals, clinical sensitivity of RDTs was poor (72.3%) and appears to be better for EIAs.\nThe analytical sensitivity is much higher for EIAs (50-to 100-fold higher). The benefit of more analytically sensitive assays with better limits of detection is that it improves detection in persons with primary infection, and in individuals in whom HBsAg levels are extremely low.\nA confirmatory test using a neutralization step can be incorporated into laboratorybased EIAs.\nTesting using laboratory-based EIAs can be automated and may be more appropriate and cost-effective in settings where there are many tests being performed per day (>40 per day per operator).\nUse of RDTs\nKey challenges to the use of RDTs include the limited availability of quality-assured RDTs for HBsAg detection, reduced analytical sensitivity compared to laboratorybased methods, and that very few HBsAg RDTs meet the analytical sensitivity (LoD 0.130 IU/mL) required by the European Union. However, overall, the Guidelines Development Group considered that the benefits of RDTs in terms of increased access would mitigate potential harms related to lower accuracy, especially if there was careful selection of RDTs that met minimum performance criteria.\nIn HIV-positive persons, RDTs had low clinical sensitivity (pooled sensitivity of 72.3%). Although this may be potentially explained by the impact of tenofovir-or lamivudinecontaining ART regimens, there is a need for caution in their use and interpretation in HIV-positive patients.\nMinimum performance criteria for EIAs and RDTs. RDTs for HBsAg have reduced analytical sensitivity and LoD compared to EIAs, as well as wide variation in clinical sensitivity and specificity between assays, and between different studies of the same assay. However, clinical sensitivity is unlikely to be greatly reduced because the vast majority of chronic HBV infection is associated with blood HBsAg concentrations well over 10 IU/mL. However, careful consideration should be given to ensure that the assay chosen has minimal rates of false positivity (both analytical and clinical). The Guidelines Development Group decided against defining minimum performance characteristics for assays, but recommended that any assay used should meet the performance criteria of stringent  regulatory authorities in terms of both analytical and clinical sensitivity and specificity.\n\n【103】 #Rationale for the recommendations on testing strategy\nBalance of benefits and harms\nWhen to use a one-assay strategy. A one-assay testing strategy is applicable to most testing settings in resource-limited countries based on simplicity and in populations where prevalence is ≥0.4%, and so PPVs are high. The Guidelines Development Group made an overall conditional recommendation for a oneassay serological testing strategy to diagnose chronic HBV infection based on low-quality evidence for the following reasons:\n- This approach will efficiently identify (rule in) most individuals likely to be infected and in need of further evaluation, and will rule out those who are uninfected.\nAlthough a one-assay serological testing strategy has a lower PPV than a twoassay serological testing strategy, particularly at lower levels of prevalence (0.4% and 2%), and will therefore generate more false-positive results, the Guidelines Development Group considered that the consequences of this would not be clinically significant. This is because all HBsAg-positive patients will have further evaluation with staging of liver disease and HBV DNA measurement to assess eligibility for treatment (i.e. presence of cirrhosis or evidence of raised HBV DNA levels). Therefore, no patient would be initiated on lifelong antiviral therapy on the basis of a single serological test.\nThe Guidelines Development Group noted that it is also common practice in many settings to perform a second test after 6 months to confirm a diagnosis of CHB and so distinguish it from acute hepatitis B. This provides an additional approach to confirm a diagnosis of chronic hepatitis infection.\nIf one uses a first test with high specificity then very few would require a second test.\nIt would considerably simplify the process of testing and reduce costs, especially if delivered at the point of care.\nMore rapid reporting of test results (ideally same day) will help improve access and linkage to care.\nEmploying two assays with a specificity of around 99% increases the ratio of true-positive to false-positive diagnoses from 0.2 to 32-40.\nThe recommendation is to confirm with a neutralization step if using laboratory-based immunoassays for detection of HBsAg, as per the assay manufacturer's instructions. Where an RDT for HBsAg is used and no neutralization reagents are available or for EIAs with no neutralization reagents, a second different RDT assay may be used . However, there has been limited evaluation of the added value of a second RDT, and there are several challenges: (i) \"different\" RDT assays may fundamentally be the same, and therefore prone to similar inaccuracies and false-positive reactions; (ii) if the analytical or clinical sensitivity of the assay used is poor (high LoD), then a larger proportion of individuals who are truly HBsAg positive will not be identified, regardless of whether a one-or two-test strategy is used.\n\n【104】 #Acceptability, values and preferences\nIn a values and preferences survey among 104 respondents from 43 (20 high-income, 23 low-and middle-income) countries, overall, there was strong support from patient groups for simplified testing strategies that would improve access to testing including for high-risk groups. Seventy-seven per cent expressed a strong preference for a one-serological assay testing strategy with same-day results using RDTs to reduce loss to follow up.\nIn a survey of programmatic experience with hepatitis testing across 19 LMICs, implementing partners reported widespread use of RDTs in all settings, and use of a single HBsAg RDT assay by 68% of respondents.\n\n【105】 considerations\nThe reagent costs for HBsAg assays are similar for RDTs (between US$ 0.95 and US$ 3.00) and EIAs (between US$ 0.40 and US$ 2.80). High-throughput EIAs require additional laboratory infrastructure and equipment, and precision and expertise in operation. In contrast, RDTs do not require capital investment in laboratory infrastructure, and so there is a concurrent reduction in maintenance costs for equipment.\n\n【106】 #Serological testing strategies\nIn adults and children older than 18 months 1 a single serological assay for initial detection of serological evidence of past or present infection is recommended prior to supplementary nucleic acid testing (NAT) for evidence of viraemic infection.\n\n【107】 #Conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence\nAbbreviations: DBS: dried blood spot; IVD: in vitro diagnostics; NAT: nucleic acid test; RDT: rapid diagnostic test 1 HCV infection can be confirmed in children under 18 months only by virological assays to detect HCV RNA, because transplacental maternal antibodies remain in the child's bloodstream up until 18 months of age, making test results from serology assays ambiguous. 2 Laboratory-based immunoassays include enzyme immunoassay (EIA), chemoluminescence immunoassay (CLIA), and electrochemoluminescence assay (ECL). 3 Assays should meet minimum acceptance criteria of either WHO prequalification of IVDs or a stringent regulatory review for IVDs. All IVDs should be used in accordance with manufacturers' instructions, and where possible at testing sites enrolled in a national or international external quality assessment scheme. A lower level of analytical sensitivity can be considered, if an assay is able to improve access (i.e. an assay that can be used at the point of care or suitable for dried blood spot  specimens) and/or affordability. An assay with a limit of detection of 3000 IU/mL or lower would be acceptable and would identify 95% of those with viraemic infection, based on available data.\nThe principal assays used to determine exposure to HCV infection and evidence of past or current HCV infection rely on detection of antibodies to HCV using relatively inexpensive serological assays. Such antibody-based assays are unable to detect infection soon after acquisition of HCV infection, as antibodies may not be detected for 2-3 months in an individual who has been recently infected . This diagnostic window period can be shortened by using assays that also directly detect HCV antigen. Assessing HCV exposure typically involves either a one-or twoserological assay testing strategy. The main rationale for the use of a second HCV antibody test is to minimize false-positive results and reduce the number of people referred for more costly NAT technologies to confirm viraemic HCV infection. If HCV antibody positivity is established consistent with past or current infection, testing for current viraemic HCV infection is performed to ascertain viral replication through the detection of HCV RNA or HCV (p22) core antigen (HCVcAg). Aside from blood and organ donation screening, HCV RNA is not currently used to determine exposure to HCV, in spite of the shorter window period (1-2 weeks after the onset of acute infection) primarily for reasons of access and cost .\n\n【108】 #Summary of the evidence\nTwelve studies compared RDTs using oral fluid to RDTs using whole blood (as well as serum or plasma) . The studies were carried out on different source populations, including the general population, key populations and hospital patients. The sample sizes of the included studies ranged from 37 to 17 894. All studies used a cross-sectional or case-control design.\n\n【109】 Brands. There was significant heterogeneity between studies and variable performance across RDT brands and even within the same brand\n\n【110】 Specimen type However, eight studies that examined OraQuick ADVANCE HCV Rapid Antibody Test (OraSure Technologies, Inc.) had a higher sensitivity of 98% (95% CI: 97-98) compared to the other brands examined in six studies ,pooled sensitivity of 88%. There were insufficient data for other key brands, including the SD-Bioline which is now WHO prequalified.\nRDTs and EIAs in HIV-positive persons. The number of studies was insufficient to undertake subanalyses based on HIV coinfection ,256. However, one recent study has reported that HCV EIAs may be associated with high rates of false positivity among HIV-infected persons in Africa .\nThe overall quality of the evidence for the recommendation to use RDTs was rated from low to moderate with downgrading mainly due to a serious risk of bias based on cross-sectional study design, and heterogeneity of results.\n\n【111】 #Which testing strategy to use\nThere was a single cost-effectiveness analysis that compared three testing strategies in a Brazilian population  . They found that a one-serological assay testing strategy for detection of anti-HCV followed by HCV RNA NAT to establish viraemic HCV infection was more cost-effective than a two-serological assay testing strategy1.\nThe outcomes show the strong influence of prevalence and assay specificity on PPV . The use of a highly sensitive and specific (98% and 99%) single assay yields a high PPV in excess of 90% at prevalences of 40% and 10%, and 67% at a 2% prevalence, and only a small number of false-positive diagnoses. Only at the lowest prevalence (e.g. 0.4%) does the PPV fall below 50%. Since overall the PPV is high at all prevalence levels with a single assay, the use of a second test would have a significant impact only in the lowest-prevalence populations (0.4%), especially if the initial assay was of lower performance.\n\n【112】 #Rationale for the recommendations on which assay to use\nOverall, the Guidelines Development Group made a strong recommendation for the use of serological assays, particularly RDTs, based on moderate/low-quality evidence for diagnostic performance. As for HBsAg, the selection of assay format (either EIA 4 or RDT) to test for HCV antibody in a particular setting will depend first on the performance characteristics of the assay, cost and also on key operational considerations, such as accessibility and ease of use in the intended-use setting, such as a community-based drug treatment programme versus a hospital-based clinic.\n\n【113】 #Balance of benefits and harms\nUse of RDTs. In settings where access to laboratory services is limited, or where existing testing services do not have the capacity for conducting EIA, and for hard-to-reach and rural populations, the Guidelines Development Group recommended (as for HIV and HBsAg) the use of quality-assured RDTs rather than conventional laboratory-based EIAs. This was due mainly to their simplicity, relatively low cost and rapid turnaround time, and therefore their potential to substantially improve access to HCV testing, enhance linkage to care and reduce loss to follow up.\nOther reasons for the preferred use of RDTs include the following:\nRDTs for the detection of antibodies to HCV have acceptable sensitivity and specificity compared to laboratory-based EIAs across a wide range of settings and different populations and for different brands. RDTs that use oral fluid are also available, which have adequate sensitivity and specificity, and may therefore be particularly useful where collection of venous or capillary whole blood is challenging.\nFor national programmes in resource-limited settings, expanded use of RDTs may mitigate the challenges of specimen collection, processing and transportation to laboratory services, and allow for the simplification and decentralization of testing.\nRDTs can also be used in outreach programmes (e.g. prison services, substance use/ treatment services) in HICs to increase the uptake of hepatitis screening. Well-trained community health workers can perform testing accurately and reliably.\nUse of EIAs. In settings with existing laboratory infrastructure or where many tests are carried out per day, testing by laboratory-based methods, such as EIAs, may be costeffective and appropriate.\nAlthough RDTs and EIAs had similar clinical sensitivity and specificity, testing using laboratory-based EIAs was recommended as the more appropriate and cost-effective assay in settings where suitable laboratory infrastructure is available, and where there is likely to be high-volume throughput, with many tests performed per day (>40 per day per operator), and in individuals who have good access to laboratory-based testing.\nIt is important to note that the latest generation of assays designed to detect HCV antibody are also designed to detect HCVcAg in order to increase the sensitivity of the assay and reduce the diagnostic window period. However, these fourth-generation assays are not typically able to differentiate HCV exposure from chronic HCV infection.\nIn HIV-positive persons. Insufficient studies were retrieved for the systematic review of persons with HIV/HCV coinfection for a formal evaluation of the diagnostic accuracy of RDTs to detect antibodies to HCV in persons who are HIV coinfected. Theoretically, the sensitivity of serological assays that detect antibodies only may be reduced if the patient is immunocompromised, e.g. persons with HIV infection, those undergoing immunosuppressive therapy or renal dialysis, and therefore exposure to HCV may not be detected in these individuals. It is estimated that this may occur in up to 6% of HIV-infected persons who undergo testing using an EIA for the detection of antibodies to HCV .\n\n【114】 #Minimum performance criteria for EIAs and RDTs. The Guidelines Development\nGroup decided against defining minimum performance characteristics for assays, but recommended that any assay used should meet the performance criteria for stringent regulatory authorities . The Group also recognized that performance of RDTs in the field (i.e. setting of intended use) may vary and that certain RDTs are not validated by the manufacturer for use on capillary whole blood. The issues of analytical sensitivity and LoD for HCV antibody assays is less relevant than for HBsAg for several reasons Second, in contrast to the 40-100-fold difference in LoD for HBsAg detection, there is a minimal difference in end-point titres for anti-HCV antibody between RDTs and EIAs.\n\n【115】 #Rationale for the recommendation for a one-assay serological testing strategy Balance of benefits and harms\nThe Guidelines Development Group made a conditional recommendation for a single test using an RDT or EIA, followed by HCV RNA NAT or core antigen on reactive specimens as the simplest and most feasible testing strategy in all settings based on low-quality evidence for several reasons.\nPredictive modelling indicates that a one-assay testing strategy efficiently identifies all but a very few individuals likely to be infected and in need of NAT testing to confirm viraemic HCV infection, and similarly excludes nearly all HCV-uninfected individuals, even at low prevalence.\nThe overall impact of the second assay on improving PPV was smaller compared to the situation with HBsAg because of the generally higher sensitivity and specificity of RDTs for HCV antibody.\nIn low-prevalence populations, a higher proportion of results would be false positive, and therefore individuals would undergo unnecessary and more expensive NAT to identify viraemic infection as a result of a single falsely reactive serological assay. In this situation, the two-assay serological testing strategy may be marginally cost saving. However, the Guidelines Development Group did not consider that the numbers of false-positive diagnoses were significant enough to justify a two-assay serological testing strategy. It was also recognized that many countries in SSA will fall into the low-seroprevalence category of less than 0.4%, and higher rates of false positivity have also been reported in these settings. As access to NAT remains very limited and costly at present, the use of a second serological test may be more cost-effective than performing NATs in multiple persons with false-positive results.\nAll IVDs should be used in accordance with manufacturers' instructions for use.\n\n【116】 #Acceptability, values and preferences\nThe values and preferences survey showed strong support by the majority for the use of RDTs delivered at the point of care to promote access, and a simplified one-serological assay testing strategy for HCV exposure, followed by supplementary testing to detect viraemic HCV infection. Providers and patients found RDTs that utilize oral fluid specimens to be more acceptable than capillary or venous whole blood specimens, especially in children. 5\n\n【117】 use\nThe cost of RDTs for HCV antibodies ranges from US$ 0.50 to US$ 2.00 for blood-based assays, and US$ 10 for oral fluid RDTs. The cost of EIAs ranges from US$ 0.50 to US$ 1.70, but EIAs require additional laboratory infrastructure and equipment, with precision and expertise required in their operation. RDTs do not require capital investment in laboratory infrastructure, and so there is a concurrent reduction in maintenance costs and reagents. Using a second different RDT assay would at least double the costs.\nA survey of hepatitis testing programmatic experience across 19 LMICs found that a oneserological assay testing strategy using mainly RDTs was being implemented in a range of hospital-based services, including blood donor screening, harm-reduction services, and HIV treatment and care clinics. 5 Most RDTs using oral fluid are yet to be validated and then evaluated in children.\n\n【118】 #Implementation considerations for HBsAg and HCV antibody serological testing\nThe most sensitive assay available, either RDT or EIA, in terms of both analytical sensitivity and clinical sensitivity, should be used. RDTs generally have a lower analytical sensitivity (IU/mL LoD) compared to EIAs. However, careful consideration should be given to ensure that the assay chosen has minimal rates of false positivity (both analytical and clinical)\n- Quality-assured and fit-for-purpose assays. Access to a range of well-performing quality-assured assays is critical to the success of any hepatitis testing programme. While a wide variety of EIAs (and CLIAs, ECLs) are commercially available, there is a lack of HBsAg RDTs that meet minimum performance criteria, as well as safety and quality standards. National regulatory authorities are responsible for approving RDTs for sale and use after assessment of their quality, safety and performance.\n\n【119】 #Linkage to care.\nAs some preliminary results will be false positive, appropriate linkage will be needed to additional testing and clinical evaluation, especially where testing is conducted at the point of care in outreach programmes. Retesting strategies need to be implemented for those with a high risk of acquisition of HCV.\n- Provision of NAT or HCVcAg testing at the same site as serological testing would be optimal, enabling rapid turnaround, reduced loss to follow up, and reduced personal and health-care costs of referral to a distant centre. The Guidelines Development Group did not consider in these guidelines the potential future testing scenario of a single NAT or HCVcAg for both diagnosis and confirmation of active infection.\n- Testing for HBV infection prior to starting DAA HCV treatment due to risk of HBV reactivation in settings and populations with higher prevalence of HBV/HCV coinfection .\n\n【120】 #Research gaps for HBsAg and HCV antibody serological testing\n- The impact of HIV positivity (and of CD4 count, viral load and ART exposure, by regimen) on the diagnostic performance of RDTs for HBsAg and HCV antibody should be further evaluated.\n- Evaluation should be done of the diagnostic performance, impact, cost and cost-effectiveness of a one-versus two-assay serological HBsAg or HCV testing strategy in diverse settings of both high and low HBsAg and HCV antibody prevalence.\n- EIAs and RDTs assays should be validated using less invasive and simpler methods of sample collection, such as oral fluid and capillary whole blood and dried blood spots (DBS).\n\n【121】 #Algorithm of WHO recommendations on the management of persons with chronic hepatitis B infection a\nNITs: non-invasive tests, ALT: alanine aminotransferase, APRI: aspartase aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index a Defined as persistence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) for six months or more.

These include:\n-persons without cirrhosis aged 30 years or less, with HBV DNA levels >20 000 IU/ mL e but persistently normal ALT; -HBeAg-negative persons without cirrhosis aged 30 years or less, with HBV DNA levels that fluctuate between 2000 and 20 000 IU/mL, or who have intermittently abnormal ALT levels d,e ; › Where HBV DNA measurement is not available: persons without cirrhosis aged 30 years or less, with persistently normal or ALT levels, regardless of HBeAg status.\na Clinical features of decompensated cirrhosis: portal hypertension (ascites, variceal haemorrhage and hepatic encephalopathy), coagulopathy, or liver insufficiency (jaundice).

Upper limits for normal ALT have been defined as below 30 U/L for men and 19 U/L for women (based on greater sensitivity observed in hepatitis B for histological disease in the liver), though local laboratory normal ranges should be applied. Persistently normal/abnormal may be defined as three ALT determinations below or above the upper limit of normal, made at unspecified intervals during a 6-12-month period or predefined intervals during a 12-month period.\ne Where HBV DNA testing is not available, other common causes of persistently raised ALT levels such as impaired glucose tolerance, dyslipidaemia and fatty liver should be excluded.\nf WHO has defined an international standard for expression of HBV DNA concentrations. Serum HBV DNA levels should be expressed in IU/mL to ensure comparability; the same assay should be used in the same patient to evaluate antiviral efficacy. All HBV DNA values in the recommendations are reported in IU/mL; values given as copies/mL were converted to IU/mL after dividing by a factor of 5 (10 000 copies/ mL = 2000 IU/mL; 100 000 copies/mL = 20 000 IU/mL; 1 million copies/mL =200 000 IU/mL).\nOccasionally, extrahepatic manifestations of hepatitis B, including glomerulonephritis or vasculitis, may be indications for treatment.\nThe decision to initiate antiviral therapy is usually based on a combined assessment of the stage of liver disease (from clinical features, and now increasingly from blood or ultrasound-based NITs), together with levels of serum ALT and HBV DNA. Serum HBV DNA concentration quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) measures the extent of viral replication and correlates with disease progression . It is used to differentiate active HBeAg-negative disease from inactive chronic infection, and inform decisions on treatment and subsequent monitoring.\nThe objective of treatment is to prevent the adverse outcomes of CHB. The decision to treat is usually clear in persons who present with life-threatening or advanced liver disease, such as acute liver failure, compensated or decompensated cirrhosis, and acute-on-chronic liver failure. However, in persons who have not yet progressed to cirrhosis, it is important that antiviral therapy is targeted to the stage of CHB when the risk of disease progression (fibrosis) is greatest while those persons with minimal fibrosis and low risk of CHB progression that do not require antiviral therapy are identified. Decisions are generally based on ALT and HBV DNA levels. However, not all persons will have raised ALT and HBV DNA levels. For example, during the immune-tolerant phase of disease, there will be high levels of HBV DNA but low or normal levels of ALT, and little liver inflammation or progression of fibrosis. Later on, during the immune-active phase, HBV DNA levels will be low, but ALT levels will be raised, with a much higher risk of disease progression to fibrosis.\n\n【122】 #Who to treat\nIn the 2015 HBV guidelines, it was recommended that antiviral therapy be prioritized for those with life-threatening liver disease (decompensated cirrhosis) and compensated cirrhosis, identified either clinically or using NITs (APRI score based on the single high cut-off >2 for cirrhosis in adults, or FibroScan), regardless of ALT or HBV DNA levels. In persons who had not progressed to cirrhosis (APRI score ≤2 in adults), it was recommended to target treatment to those at highest risk of disease progression based on the detection of persistently abnormal ALT and HBV DNA levels >20 000 IU/mL (especially in those aged >30 years, regardless of HBeAg status). The recommended thresholds were derived from consistent evidence from large population-based cohort studies of increased risk of HCC and liver cirrhosis above these thresholds. It was recognized that there were uncertainties in the specific thresholds of age, HBV DNA and serum ALT levels for identifying significant fibrosis and/or necroinflammation.\n\n【123】 #Who not to treat\nConversely, treatment was not recommended in persons with minimal liver disease or fibrosis, and at low risk of progression to cirrhosis and HCC on the basis of persistently normal ALT levels and low levels of HBV replication (<2000 IU/mL), and an APRI score ≤2, as the potential harms of long-term antiviral therapy outweigh the benefits. Long-term monitoring of these persons is required.\nIn settings where HBV DNA testing is not available\nThe current limited access to HBV DNA testing in many LMICs is a significant impediment to the effective management of CHB in these settings, and this means that decisions to start treatment will be based on clinical features and serum ALT levels alone.\nOverall, there was a very limited evidence base to guide recommendations in the absence of HBV DNA levels, and two conditional recommendations were made in the 2015 WHO HBV guidelines based mainly on expert opinion. First, treatment should be initiated in persons with persistently abnormal ALT levels (regardless of HBeAg status), but where other common causes of persistently abnormal ALT such as impaired glucose tolerance, dyslipidaemia and fatty liver have been excluded. Conversely, treatment was not recommended in HBeAg-negative persons without cirrhosis aged less than 30 years with persistently normal ALT levels. It was recognized that there are several other categories of persons with CHB who do not meet the criteria for initiating or not initiating treatment, who would also require continued monitoring and observation.\n\n【124】 #Implementation considerations\n- Access to HBV DNA testing is currently very limited in most LMICs, and is a significant impediment to the effective management of CHB in these settings.\n- Serum HBV DNA levels should be expressed in IU/mL to ensure comparability; values given as copies/mL can be converted to IU/mL by dividing by a factor of 5 to approximate the conversion used in the most commonly used assays (i.e. 10 000 copies/mL = 2000 IU/mL; 100 000 copies/mL = 20 000 IU/mL; 1 million copies/mL = 200 000 IU/mL).\n\n【125】 #During and after treatment\nMonitoring while on treatment is required to assess adherence, evaluate whether viral suppression is sustained (where HBV DNA can be measured), assess the potential for treatment discontinuation, and progression of liver disease, including development of HCC. Monitoring after treatment is important to check for reactivation early on and when to restart treatment.\n\n【126】 #Rationale for the recommendations (WHO 2015 HBV guidelines)\nThe optimal timing and frequency of monitoring for serological markers (HBeAg, serum ALT) and HBV DNA to ascertain alterations in disease patterns prior to treatment, as well as assess treatment response have not been well established, and the evidence base is limited.\n\n【127】 #Balance of benefits and harms\nMonitoring prior to treatment\nThe 2015 HBV guidelines  recommended at least annual monitoring of HBV DNA levels, HBeAg and serum ALT to determine any persistent abnormality in ALT or HBV DNA levels (i.e. HBV DNA threshold above >20 000 IU/mL and ALT levels) consistent with risk of disease progression, as well as for development of cirrhosis ,based on clinical features or on NITs, which would be an indication for antiviral therapy. Additional monitoring of HBeAg may be helpful for several reasons: it indicates the presence of active HBV replication and high infectivity, and spontaneous improvement may occur following HBeAgpositive seroconversion (anti-HBe), with a decline in HBV replication and normalization of ALT levels. This confers a good prognosis and does not require treatment. More frequent monitoring was recommended conditionally (based on limited evidence) in those who already have fluctuating raised ALT or HBV DNA levels (between 2000 IU/mL and 20 000 IU/mL) as they are at a higher risk of progression to active hepatitis and require treatment.\n\n【128】 #Monitoring during and after treatment\nThe 2015 WHO HBV guidelines  recommended at least annual monitoring of ALT, HBeAg (for seroconversion to anti-HBe) and HBV DNA levels (where testing is available), and also NITs such as APRI to assess for progression to cirrhosis. HBV genotyping and resistance testing are not required to guide therapy This shows that potent nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs) with a high barrier to resistance (i.e. tenofovir and entecavir) suppress HBV DNA replication to low or undetectable levels in the majority of persons (around 80% and 50-70% in HBeAg-positive and -negative persons, respectively) by 24-48 weeks of treatment, with low rates of resistance. The data also suggest that if good adherence can be confirmed, monitoring can be relatively infrequent. However, there is limited success in achieving durable end-points, particularly loss of HBeAg in HBeAg-positive persons or loss of HBsAg.\nMore frequent and careful monitoring was recommended conditionally based on limited evidence in: (i) those with more advanced disease (compensated or decompensated cirrhosis) because the risk of HCC is reduced but not eliminated with treatment, and their higher risk of adverse events; (ii) during the first year of treatment to assess treatment response; (iii) where adherence to therapy is a concern; and (iv) after stopping therapy, especially in the first year to detect severe exacerbations. Retreatment is recommended if there are consistent signs of reactivation (HBsAg or HBeAg becomes positive, ALT levels increase, or HBV DNA becomes detectable again).\n\n【129】 #Implementation considerations\nThere are cost implications to regular ALT and DNA monitoring. Where there is limited access to HBV DNA assays, such as in LMICs (particularly rural areas), monitoring will require, at a minimum, serum ALT levels to establish the risk of progression. However, interpretation of disease stage and exacerbations of disease in HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative persons is enhanced by concomitant measurement of HBV DNA concentrations. Integrating routine monitoring for HCC alongside routine monitoring for disease progression provides a further opportunity to detect the development of cirrhosis and initiate antiviral therapy to prevent progression to HCC or liver failure.\n\n【130】 #Detection of viraemic infection\n- Directly following a reactive HCV antibody serological test result, the use of quantitative or qualitative NAT for detection of HCV RNA is recommended as the preferred strategy to diagnose viraemic infection.\nStrong recommendation, moderate/low quality of evidence - An assay to detect HCV core (p22) antigen, which has comparable clinical sensitivity to NAT, is an alternative to NAT to diagnose viraemic infection 1.\n\n【131】 #Conditional recommendation, moderate quality of evidence\n1 A lower level of analytical sensitivity can be considered if an assay is able to improve access (i.e. an assay that can be used at the point of care or suitable for dried blood spot  specimens) and/or affordability. An assay with a limit of detection of 3000 IU/mL or lower would be acceptable and would identify 95% of those with viraemic infection, based on available data.\nDetection of antibodies to HCV is used to determine current or past HCV infection (i.e. exposure to HCV infection), and therefore to triage those who require further evaluation to determine if active viral replication is present. Approximately 15-45% of persons who are infected with HCV will spontaneously clear the infection . These persons remain HCV antibody positive but are no longer infected with HCV. Diagnosis of viraemic HCV infection in those who are HCV antibody positive will distinguish persons with viraemic HCV infection and in need of treatment from those who have cleared the infection. This is generally done using NAT technologies to detect HCV RNA, but an alternative and potentially less costly option to NAT is to conduct testing to detect HCV core (p22) antigen.\n\n【132】 #Nucleic acid testing (NAT)\nBoth quantitative and qualitative methods are available for the detection of viraemic HCV infection. Quantitative NAT has been widely used for measuring viral load and identifying those in need of treatment, as well as in assessing treatment response .\nHCV core (p22) antigen testing\n\n【133】 #DETECTION OF VIRAEMIC HCV INFECTION -to guide who to treat\nIn addition to NAT, it is possible to assess for viraemic infection by testing for HCVcAg -an HCV nucleocapsid peptide 22 (p22), which is released into the plasma during viral assembly and can be detected both early on and throughout the course of HCV infection . Serological methods that test for detection of HCVcAg have the potential to be less costly and centralized than NAT, but evaluation has been limited in low-resource settings. There are now several assays commercially available for stand-alone detection of HCVcAg . Detection of HCVcAg has also been used as an additional marker in a fourth-generation HCV Ag/Ab serological assay, because HCVcAg is detectable earlier than antibodies to HCV. However, the addition of core antigen was intended to increase sensitivity of the assay in early infection and not to differentiate seropositivity from active viraemic HCV infection.\n\n【134】 #Summary of the evidence\nTwo systematic reviews were undertaken, which evaluated the diagnostic accuracy for detection of viraemic HCV infection of (i) qualitative versus quantitative NAT ; and (ii) HCVcAg testing versus NAT  .\n\n【135】 #Diagnostic accuracy and limit of detection of HCV NAT assays\nAlthough early-generation qualitative NAT assays were able to detect the presence of HCV in plasma at concentrations a full log lower (i.e. about 10-fold less) than quantitative NAT assays, the lower limit of quantification of new versions of quantitative assays is now comparable to most commercial qualitative assays, i.e. 15 IU/mL.\n\n【136】 #Diagnostic accuracy and limits of detection of HCVcAg assays\nThere were 50 studies that evaluated seven commercial HCVcAg assays. There was significant variation in performance between the different assay brands , A pooled quantitative analysis of data available from three studies demonstrated a close correlation between HCVcAg and HCV RNA at viral loads above 3000 IU/mL. The LoD for the most sensitive assay is 3 fmol/L HCVcAg or 0.06 pg/mL, which equates to an LoD of about ~1000-3000 IU/mL by NAT, and is consistent with the analytical sensitivity (LoD) reported by the manufacturer.\n\n【137】 The overall quality of the evidence for the recommendation to use HCVcAg was rated as low to moderate because of inconsistency and imprecision.\n\n【138】 #Rationale for the recommendations Balance of benefits and harms\nUse of quantitative or qualitative NAT assays for detection of HCV RNA\nThe Guidelines Development Group made a strong recommendation for the use of a NAT assay (either qualitative or quantitative) as the preferred strategy for diagnosis of viraemic HCV infection based on moderate-/low-quality evidence for several reasons:\nA supplementary review of the literature showed that that 95% of those with chronic infection have a viral load >10 000 IU/mL except, temporarily, a minority with partial viral control between 5 and 12 months post infection. Therefore, the range of clinically observed HCV viral loads is rarely below the lower range of the limit of quantification (LoQ) of quantitative assays, and most NAT assays (quantitative or qualitative) will capture the majority of viraemic infections.\nAlthough quantitative RNA assays are considered the gold standard assays for the diagnosis and monitoring of HCV, the high cost of these assays and laboratory requirements means that they are not readily available in resource-limited settings. However, new NATs for use at or near the point of care for quantitation of HCV RNA are already available. These devices are easier to use than the laboratory-based NAT assays and can potentially improve access to diagnosis of viraemic HCV infection.\n\n【139】 #Use of HCV core antigen for detection of HCV RNA\nThe Guidelines Development Group recognized that there is limited access to NAT assays in resource-limited settings and that this represents an important barrier to antiviral treatment. The Group made a conditional recommendation to consider use of HCVcAg assays as an alternative to NAT to diagnose viraemic HCV infection, based on moderate-quality evidence, for several reasons:\nHCVcAg assays can utilize existing serological testing platforms and are potentially lower-cost options than NAT. They could serve as a more affordable replacement to NAT for HCV detection in the future.\nAlthough HCVcAg testing is currently limited to only a few platforms and even those with the highest performance do not reach the sensitivity of NAT, some well-performing HCVcAg assays have high sensitivity ,up to 93.4% for certain commercial assays and high specificity (>98%), and good correlation with HCV RNA to an LoD of roughly 3000 IU/mL, which will detect over 95% of chronic HCV infections. However, it was noted that there was wide variation in sensitivity/specificity between assays and also within the same brand of assay for all but the Abbott ARCHITECT.\nHCVcAg tests also offer the potential in the future to be applied as a one-step screening test as HCVcAg appears earlier than HCV antibodies (1-2 days after HCV RNA appears), has a high specificity, and so does not require any further confirmatory testing. However, such a strategy would be cost-effective only in very high-prevalence settings.\n\n【140】 #Acceptability, values and preferences\nThe values and preferences survey identified preferences for future HCV testing strategies among respondents. Key preferences were for a single-step HCV diagnostic strategy with a low-cost point-of-care test for confirming viraemic infection (48% of respondents). Of these, 52% opted for an HCV RNA test because of its high sensitivity, and 35% for an HCVcAg assay because of its lower cost and ease of use. More than half the respondents were prepared to compromise on sensitivity down to 95% in order to gain a reduction in the price of the test. Forty-seven per cent of respondents also indicated a preference for a test that uses capillary blood and therefore could be more easily performed in point-of-care settings, even at the expense of test sensitivity. A short turnaround time (at least same day) was identified as another key consideration to reduce loss to follow up, cost of transportation, and enable providers to see more patients within a day.\nThe survey of hepatitis testing experience in 19 LMICs found that NAT for HCV RNA is available at a third of the sites but 40% of respondent countries do not have access to NAT for HCV diagnosis in their countries. The HCVcAg assay was not available at any site.\n\n【141】 considerations\nThe resources required for quantitative NAT were considered to be substantial, with the cost per test ranging from US$ 30 to US$ 200. Furthermore, the laboratory equipment is expensive and requires technicians with specialized training. The cost of testing for HCVcAg is currently US$ 25-50 (MSF data), which is comparable to qualitative NAT (US$ 43-51), but this is still a major barrier to its use.\n\n【142】 #Implementation considerations\n- Near patient or point-of-care (POC) technologies. The development of reliable and affordable POC NAT and HCVcAg tests able to diagnose viraemic infection in field settings will be crucial for expanding hepatitis testing services . These devices offer the possibility of a same-day diagnosis of viraemic infection either alone or when combined with an HCV antibody RDT and for test of cure. Since they are also more affordable than the laboratory-based assays, they can potentially improve access to early diagnosis, monitoring and linkage to care and treatment services, as well as reduce loss to follow up.\n- Immediate NAT directly after a positive serological result. The value of prompt testing for viraemia after a positive antibody result was highlighted, as patients with resolved HCV infection following spontaneous clearance can be reassured and those with viraemic infection could be promptly referred for care and treatment.\n\n【143】 #Research gaps\n- Establish the proportion of patients with chronic HCV infection with low viral loads that may be missed by HCV RNA or cAg assays that have a higher limit of detection (i.e. 3000 IU/mL).\n- Evaluate the diagnostic accuracy, cost, cost-effectiveness and impact of HCVcAg or HCV RNA assays as a one-step diagnostic strategy.\n- Assess the impact of HIV or HBV coinfection or genotype (particularly genotypes 4, 5 and 6, on which there are limited data) on detection of viraemia.\n- 1. Recommendation\nDetection of HCV viraemia is important to assess the response to treatment . Prior to the introduction of curative oral DAA treatment regimens, treatment with interferon (IFN)-based regimens required frequent monitoring of HCV viral load levels during therapy to decide whether treatment should be stopped, or treatment duration could be shortened. Previously, these multiple measurements included a viral load measurement at week 4 of therapy to help predict the efficacy of therapy, and then again at week 12 (early viral response, EVR), and finally at 12 and 24 weeks after completion of therapy to test for cure (sustained viral response, SVR).\nThese multiple assessments are now no longer relevant with the newer DAAs because of the relative infrequency of viral breakthrough and because the rate of viral load decline does not correlate with SVR. In fact, in most persons treated with DAAs, the viral load is undetectable 4 weeks after treatment initiation. In view of the high cost and relative unavailability of NAT testing for HCV RNA, this provides an important opportunity to reduce the frequency of on-treatment laboratory monitoring. HCVcAg testing has also been proposed as an alternative to HCV RNA for the diagnosis of viraemic HCV infection. However, there remains debate about whether HCVcAg can also be used as a tool for assessing the response to HCV antiviral treatment and to test for cure.\n\n【144】 #Summary of the evidence\nThe accuracy of HCVcAg for treatment monitoring and to confirm successful viral clearance (test of cure) was assessed by descriptive analysis of five studies  of two HCVcAg assays in comparison with HCV RNA NAT (qualitative and/or quantitative) . All studies were based on patients with mainly genotype 1b infection and on IFN-based therapy. The sensitivity of the HCVcAg assay in EVR ranged from 74% to 100% and specificity from 70% to 100%. SVR was assessed in only two studies with 100% sensitivity and specificity ranging from 94% to 100%. There were only three studies that evaluated the same assay -the Abbott ARCHITECT HCV Ag assay. There were no studies that evaluated the use of HCVcAg assay for monitoring treatment response using DAA IFN-free treatment regimens.\n- ASSESSMENT OF HCV TREATMENT RESPONSE -test of cure\n\n【145】 #Rationale for the recommendation Balance of benefits and harms\nUse of qualitative or quantitative HCV RNA as a test of cure\nThe Guidelines Development Group recommended the use of either qualitative or quantitative NAT detection of HCV RNA as a test of cure at 12 weeks (or 24 weeks if 12 weeks is not possible) after completion of treatment. Although either assay was recommended, the lower cost of qualitative assays for HCV RNA makes them preferable to quantitative NAT as a test of cure at 12 weeks .\n\n【146】 #Use of HCVcAg as a test of cure\nThe Guidelines Development Group recognized that dependence on detection of HCV RNA by NAT to assess response to HCV antiviral treatment and test of cure, especially in remote settings, could be a barrier to the setting up of hepatitis C treatment and testing services. However, the data on HCVcAg in treatment monitoring and assessment of test of cure (SVR) was considered to be too limited to recommend its use as a substitute for HCV RNA.\n\n【147】 #Timing of test of cure\nThe Guidelines Development Group recognized that in the new era of treatment with curative DAA regimens, monitoring of viraemia during therapy with HCV RNA by NAT may no longer be necessary , and that a single negative test of viral load at 12 weeks after completion of therapy (SVR12) is now the benchmark for assessing treatment outcome and cure used in all clinical studies of DAA-based regimens.\n\n【148】 #Acceptability, values and preferences\nIn the values and preferences survey of implementers and users of hepatitis testing services, almost half of the survey respondents expressed a preference for the test of cure to be performed 12 weeks after completion of HCV therapy because this was the earliest time point to reliably establish cure. However, one third expressed a preference for this to be performed more promptly after completion of treatment -at 4 weeks (20% of respondents) and 8 weeks (16%).\nIn the values and preferences survey, HCVcAg assay was reported as not available at any of the sites, and 40% of respondents also reported that they did not have access to HCV NAT in their countries.\n\n【149】 considerations\nThe availability of validated POC NAT assays, and further reduction in costs of both qualitative and quantitative NAT, will be critical to improve access to diagnosis and monitoring in LMICs.\n- 5. Implementation considerations 1. Re-infection. The possibility of reinfection with HCV after successful treatment should be considered, and persons treated but who are still at active risk (e.g. current PWID) should be advised to retest annually for HCV RNA.\n- Timing of test of cure. A test of cure at 24 weeks (SVR24) after completion of treatment may be considered as an alternative SVR time-point, if SVR12 is not possible. Similarly, in populations for which there are limited data on the correlation between SVR12 and SVR24, e.g. patients with cirrhosis, HIV/HCV coinfection and other immunocompromised states, SVR24 may be considered.\n- Impact of co-morbidities. Clinical judgement based on the patient's clinical circumstances, such as presence of HIV coinfection, cirrhosis or renal impairment, potential drug interactions and clinical well-being during treatment, may necessitate more frequent monitoring for side-effects and disease progression.\nTesting for HBV infection prior to starting DAA HCV treatment due to risk of HBV reactivation and worsening of liver disease in settings and populations with higher prevalence of HBV/HCV coinfection .\n\n【150】 #Research gaps\n- The impact of HIV or HBV coinfection and genotype on diagnostic accuracy of HCVcAg and quantitative/qualitative HCV RNA NAT as a test of cure should be assessed.\n- Specific situations where quantitative NAT assay may be indicated, i.e. shortened DAA treatment course to 8 weeks, should be evaluated in those with lower baseline HCV RNA levels.\n- The correlation between SVR12 and SVR24 should be evaluated in populations where there are more limited data, e.g. patients with cirrhosis, HIV/HCV coinfection and other immunocompromised states.\n- Further studies are needed in different settings and populations to establish frequency, severity and predictors of HBV reactivation during or after DAA therapy in HBV/HCV coinfected patients.\n\n【151】 #Recommendations Topic Recommendations\nSerological testing - The use of DBS specimens for HBsAg and HCV antibody serology testing 1 may be considered in settings where: -there are no facilities or expertise to take venous whole blood specimens; or -RDTs are not available or their use is not feasible; or there are persons with poor venous access (e.g. in drug treatment programmes, prisons).\n\n【152】 #Detection of viraemia (nucleic acid testing)\n- The use of DBS specimens to test for HBV DNA and HCV RNA for diagnosis of HBV and HCV viraemia 1 respectively, may be considered in settings where: -there is a lack of access to sites or nearby laboratory facilities for NAT, or provision for timely delivery of specimens to a laboratory; or there are persons with poor venous access (e.g. in drug treatment programmes, prisons).\n\n【153】 #Conditional recommendation, low (HBV)/moderate (HCV) quality of evidence\n1 Well-functioning laboratory specimens referral network and system for return of results should be in place to maximize the impact of DBS specimens. There are currently few assays where the manufacturer's instructions state that DBS specimens are validated for use. Therefore, currently use of DBS specimens would be considered \"off-label\".\nSignificant scale up in access to hepatitis testing and treatment will require further simplification of the process of diagnosis and monitoring, and methods to facilitate access to testing, especially in decentralized settings, and among vulnerable populations worldwide, such as PWID and people in prison. DBS is an alternative specimen collection method that does not require venepuncture, and is being increasingly used to facilitate access to serological testing and NAT for HIV, hepatitis B and C, and other infectious diseases , particularly in remote and underresourced regions with poor access to laboratory services, as well as for large epidemiological surveillance studies. DBS sampling involves obtaining a whole blood specimen, usually by capillary finger-stick (or heel-prick in infants), and embedding the drops of blood onto filter paper, or by pipetting venous blood onto filter paper. DBS specimens can then be transported from remote areas to a laboratory by standard means, e.g. posted to a laboratory, where testing would take place. The simplicity and relative ease of specimen collection, preparation, transport and storage make DBS specimens a potential option for serological testing and NAT in low-resource settings .\n\n【154】 #USE OF DRIED BLOOD SPOT SPECIMENS FOR SEROLOGICAL AND VIROLOGICAL TESTING\nAn increasing number of studies have been undertaken to validate the use of DBS specimens to test for HBsAg and antibodies to HCV, and NAT for HBV DNA and HCV RNA , including systematic reviews on HCV RNA detection using DBS specimens , and on the uptake of HCV screening .\n\n【155】 #Summary of the evidence\nFour updated systematic reviews and meta-analyses were undertaken to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and impact of using DBS specimens compared to venous blood specimens for hepatitis B and C serological testing and NAT . The reviews evaluated the pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios, as well as the impact and duration of different storage conditions. Ten studies were included in the meta-analysis for HBsAg ,290,293, 17 studies for HCV antibody ,256,293,298,299, 10 studies for HBV DNA ,293,301, and 9 studies for HCV RNA ,305,311,312, based on an update of one study in an existing review 1.\nThe pooled sensitivity for detection of HBsAg in DBS specimens compared to plasma or serum specimens was 92.9% (95% CI: 86.2-96.5%) and specificity 99.9% (95% CI: 96.2-99.7%), and for antibodies to HCV the sensitivity was 98% (95% CI: 94-99%) and specificity 99% (95% CI: 97-100%).\nImpact of storage conditions. Most studies used storage conditions not applicable to typical field conditions (i.e. storage in a freezer or refrigerator). Those studies that investigated variation of results after storage of specimens in different conditions found that specimens could become false-positive with longer exposure at ambient temperatures for HCV antibody .\n\n【156】 #Nucleic acid testing\nOverall, studies and data were more limited for NAT than for serology testing, especially for HBV DNA, and had smaller sample sizes and were of lower quality. Nine studies contributed to the quantitative analysis of the diagnostic accuracy of HBV DNA measurement in DBS specimens compared to serum samples. Pooled sensitivity for HBV DNA measurement in DBS specimens was 96% (95% CI: 90-98%) and specificity 99% (95% CI: 55-100%), and for HCV RNA, 96.0% (95% CI: 93.4-97.6%) and 97.7% (95% CI: 94.7-99.0%). The descriptive review also shows a good correlation and strong association between quantitative values for HBV DNA on DBS specimens and in serum samples.\nImpact of storage conditions. No study reported on storage conditions longer than 24 hours at room temperature for DBS specimens to test for HBV, but several studies that varied storage conditions for individual specimens found no effect on the qualitative result of these assays .\nThe quality of evidence for recommendations to use DBS for HBV and HCV serology was rated as low to moderate for HBV and low for HCV, and for HBV and HCV NAT, it was low for HBV and moderate for HCV.\n\n【157】 #Rationale for the recommendations Balance of benefits and harms\nBenefits of use of DBS.\nThe Guidelines Development Group recognized that the principal benefit of DBS specimens is their potential to facilitate greater access to testing in settings where venepuncture and laboratory facilities are not easy to access. This is largely because of the relative ease of specimen collection with avoidance of venepuncture, easier handling that does not require high skill, transportation with a lower biohazard risk, and easier storage options.\nAlthough data are still limited, DBS specimens are generally stable over time and maintain good accuracy in conditions with higher temperatures or humidity.\n\n【158】 #Risks of use of DBS.\n2.\nThe main disadvantage is that the assay manufacturers have not yet validated their existing commercial assays with DBS specimens, which is required for regulatory approval for use of this specimen.\nThe minimum performance criteria of a DBS (whole blood) specimen for HBV and HCV serology and NAT are not well established.\nAcceptable storage conditions need to be determined and validated by the manufacturer of the assay.\nThere is also conflicting evidence on whether DBS increases the uptake of hepatitis testing among different vulnerable populations, as some studies have not confirmed this trend .\nOverall, despite these caveats, the Guidelines Development Group considered that the procedural advantages make DBS specimens a good option for HBV and HCV testing in remote settings or specific populations. A conditional recommendation was therefore made to consider the use of DBS specimens as an option for both HBV and HCV serology and/or NAT, especially in specific settings, where there are either no facilities or expertise to take venous blood specimens, or there are persons with poor venous access (e.g. PWID and people in prisons). Use of DBS specimens for serological diagnosis was also recommended when RDTs are not available or their use is not feasible.\n\n【159】 #Assessing response to antiviral treatment\nThe Guidelines Development Group did not make a recommendation for the use of DBS specimens to assess response to antiviral treatment because of the lack of studies that have specifically addressed this question. Preliminary evidence shows that patients failing DAAs have high viral loads at 12 or 24 weeks after treatment completion, suggesting that testing with DBS may be feasible.\n\n【160】 #Limits of detection\nFor HBV DNA, existing WHO guidance  defines the HBV DNA threshold for initiation of treatment as ≥20 000 IU/mL, and does not recommend treating those with persistently normal ALT levels and low levels of HBV DNA replication (HBV DNA <2000 IU/mL) . Therefore, assays for use in the field would not need to detect HBV DNA below 2000 IU/mL. Most individual studies suggest that the sensitivity of HBV DNA detection above 2000 IU/ mL is good, and the LoD in DBS specimens is 900-4000 IU/mL, which means they would therefore be able to identify the majority of patients who require antiviral treatment.\nFor HCV RNA, it is estimated that the majority of people with viraemic HCV infection will have high viral loads >10 000 IU/mL. Although the thresholds at which HCV RNA can be detected using DBS specimens are not well characterized, the evidence suggests that qualitative detection of HCV RNA using DBS specimens is possible and accurate within this range.\n\n【161】 #Acceptability, values and preferences\nThe majority of respondents (implementers and users of hepatitis testing services) to the values and preferences survey from LMICs expressed a preference for DBS sampling because of the potential enhanced access to testing. They also considered that it was equally important for serology and NAT.\n\n【162】 #Feasibility and programmatic experience\nThere is limited programmatic experience with the use of DBS specimens for hepatitis B and C testing, but DBS has been incorporated into several screening programmes and has been used to scale up hepatitis C testing in certain populations in the UK .\n\n【163】 use\nDBS sampling may reduce costs associated with sample collection, storage and transportation, potential for batch testing in a centralized laboratory, in addition to staff costs by facilitating task-shifting to lay workers.\n\n【164】 #Benefits Challenges and concerns\nEase of specimen collection. DBS specimen collection involves pricking a finger or a heel without the need for venepuncture, and so avoids the need for a trained health worker.\nStorage conditions. Few studies have systematically examined the effects of storage and transport conditions on the accuracy of results from DBS specimens. However, some data suggest that there may be instability of results when stored for prolonged durations (more than 14 days) at high temperatures (room temperature and above) and humidity, particular for serological testing.\nEase of sample transport. Specimen transport and logistics are simplified as, apart from the advantage of avoiding venepuncture, DBS specimen handling does not require high skill and the biohazard risk is thought to be less . Assay cut-offs. The use of a DBS specimen may require adjustment of the assay cut-off to determine test positivity for serological screening, as DBS specimens use a small volume of blood.\nLaboratory capacity. The actual laboratory work can be more difficult with a DBS specimen compared to a serum/plasma specimen, because it involves manual specimen processing, and requires a laboratory experienced in and competent at handling and processing these specimens. It also involves the need to maintain quality assurance of testing a specimen potentially off-label from the manufacturers' validated specimen types . there may be no facilities or expertise to take venous blood samples, such as prison and drug treatment services.\n- In France, guidelines from the Haute Autorité Sanitaire and AFEF-ANRS also recommended the use of DBS tests as an alternative to venous blood tests. However, the lack of standardization has limited the adoption of DBS, and as a result, there has been no clear recommendation for expansion of DBS testing.\n- In Scotland, 26% of new hepatitis C diagnoses during 2009-2013 were made in specialist drug services where DBS testing was introduced.\n- 5. Implementation considerations 1. Settings for DBS implementation. The choice of whether to use DBS sampling for hepatitis B and C serological testing or NAT or both will depend on the health-care setting and infrastructure, and epidemiological context. Different programmes may opt for varying combinations: (i) DBS serology + DBS NAT (remote settings, hard-to-reach populations and those with poor venous access); (ii) RDT serology + DBS NAT (clinics, e.g. antenatal services); or (iii) EIA serology + plasma-based NAT (urban settings or larger hospitals). Therefore, if good-quality RDTs are available that can be performed using capillary blood, then the focus may be more on prioritizing DBS for NAT testing of HBV DNA and HCV RNA. However, if RDTs are not available and there are no facilities or expertise to take venous blood samples, then DBS testing may be equally important to increase access to serological testing as well as NAT and, conveniently, both could be performed from the same specimen if multiple spots are taken. Use of DBS may also be useful when large numbers of individuals are being tested at the same point in time, e.g.\ndrug treatment centres, prisons, or where polyvalent screening for multiple diseases, such as HIV/HBV/HCV, is being undertaken, but where multiplex RDTs for this purpose are not available or are more costly .\n\n【165】 #Validation of DBS with manufacturers' assays. The use of DBS specimens\nhas not yet been validated by assay manufacturers with their commercial assays, and under different storage and transport conditions. Addressing this is a priority for implementation, together with access to appropriate laboratory facilities and experience.\n- Laboratory QA/QC. The adoption of DBS sampling in a hepatitis testing programme requires the availability of a centralized laboratory experienced in and competent at handling and processing this sample type, as well as maintaining QA of testing a specimen potentially off-label from the manufacturers' validated specimen types.\nTraining. Lay workers will need to be trained to perform finger-prick DBS, and systems put in place for timely and efficient communication of results.\n\n【166】 #Reducing loss to follow up.\nThe mobility and instability of some vulnerable populations has raised concerns that DBS may be associated with a low rate of returning for results and linkage to care and treatment. This is suggested by reports of low rate of return and linkage to care and treatment in drug treatment programme centres in France, particularly with DBS testing.\n\n【167】 #Research gaps\nA major constraint to implementation of DBS sampling is the limited programmatic experience with its use for hepatitis testing in different settings. Priority areas for research and development include development of manufacturers' guidance and regulatory approval of commercial assays using DBS specimens, and the establishment of large-scale demonstration projects of DBS for hepatitis serological testing and NAT in different settings.\nSpecific research areas include the following:\n- Larger diagnostic accuracy and validation studies should be conducted on the use of DBS specimens for serology and NAT with optimal assay cut-offs, and across a range of storage and transport conditions common in the field (i.e. no cold chain, high and low humidity). This should also include additional studies in HIV-coinfected patients.\n- The optimal preparation of DBS specimens prior to analysis should be studied. This includes differences between capillary versus venous blood, most appropriate volume of capillary whole blood and best type of filter paper to be used.\nUptake of testing and linkage to care are both essential initial components of the hepatitis B and C care continuum (Fig. 1.1). However, currently, levels of uptake of testing for hepatitis B and C are very low , as well as structural or economic factors such as stigma and discrimination, distance from care sites, lack of or cost of transportation,\n\n【168】 #IMPROVING THE UPTAKE OF TESTING AND LINKAGE TO CARE AND PREVENTION\nand long waiting times at the facility . Hepatitis C also disproportionally affects individuals with comorbid mental health or substance use issues. Traditionally, services for hepatitis, mental health and substance use have been provided by separate clinicians or teams often located in different health facilities, which may contribute to HCV treatment dropout and/or treatment failure .\nOptimizing the impact of effective treatments and prevention will require interventions to both expand uptake of testing and improve linkage to care and retention across the care continuum, from initial screening to treatment initiation and viral suppression (HBV) or cure (HCV). Such interventions may vary based on the local context, including the health-care delivery system, geography and target population. There are several well-established evidence-based interventions that improve linkage to care and treatment of people who have received an HIVpositive diagnosis, and were included as recommendations in the WHO 2015 HIV consolidated testing guidelines  and the 2016 ARV consolidated guidelines , which may also apply to viral hepatitis care and prevention.\n\n【169】 #Summary of the evidence\nA systematic review was undertaken to assess the impact of different interventions to enhance five key steps along the continuum of care for chronic viral hepatitis -screening, linkage to care, treatment uptake, treatment adherence, and ultimately viral suppression. Fifty-four studies were included in the review, of which 37 studies addressed interventions and outcomes across the HCV care continuum, 15 across the HBV care continuum, and two across both ,334. Thirty-three studies were included in a meta-analysis that generated pooled effect size estimates for different outcomes. Interventions to improve retention along the HBV continuum of care were limited to promoting testing and linkage to care, while interventions along the HCV continuum of care addressed all five steps. Interventions to address adherence, viral suppression, and uptake of HCV testing were the best studied, but there were few methodologically rigorous studies for promoting linkage to care, and particularly few studies on HBV. All studies except one  were from high-income countries. Most existing studies were rated as being of low or very low methodological quality, because of risk of bias due to study design issues, and a high degree of heterogeneity across studies.\n\n【170】 #Promotion of HBV testing by lay health workers\nNearly half (7/15) of the interventions to improve the uptake of HBV testing involved lay health worker interventions ,348,354,368,376. The majority of these were one-time activities that delivered educational content tailored to a particular community's cultural and social context, mainly Asian communities in the United States or Canada. Pooled meta-analysis from six studies showed that a single HBV test promotion intervention by lay health workers increased HBV testing rates compared to groups that received no or unrelated educational interventions ,relative risk  = 2.68. The quality of evidence was rated as moderate.\n\n【171】 #Clinician reminders to prompt HCV testing during clinical visits\nUnlike interventions to improve HBV testing, which were primarily delivered in community settings, all 11 of the interventions to improve HCV testing either targeted health-care providers or took place at established health-care facilities . These studies found that clinician reminders to prompt HCV screening during clinical visits substantially increased HCV testing rates compared to no clinician reminders ,RR = 3.70. The quality of evidence was rated as very low.\n\n【172】 #Integrated care between mental health and HCV treatment specialists\nSeveral studies evaluated interventions providing \"coordinated\", \"integrated\", or \"multidisciplinary\" care to improve treatment adherence and viral suppression in patients with mental health issues.345,352,359,365,369,381\n\n【173】 #Interventions to promote linkage to care for HIV\nThere are several well-established evidence-based interventions that improve linkage to care and treatment of people who have received an HIV-positive diagnosis, and were included as recommendations in the WHO 2015 HIV consolidated guidelines on HIV testing services  and the 2016 ARV consolidated guidelines 1 outlines some of these approaches, which may also be applicable to viral hepatitis care and prevention.\n\n【174】 #Rationale for the recommendations Balance of benefits and harms\nThe Guidelines Development Group recognized that poor uptake of viral hepatitis testing and linkage to care is a major barrier to access to care and treatment. To expand access to testing and treatment, programmes need to not only make use of multiple testing approaches at the facility and community levels, but also adopt interventions to promote optimal linkage to prevention and treatment. The Guidelines Development Group made a strong recommendation for the general adoption and implementation of a series of relatively simple, low-cost but effective strategies (promotion of testing by lay health workers, clinician reminders and coordinated care between hepatitis and mental health specialists) to enhance uptake of hepatitis testing and linkage to care, based on generally low-quality evidence from the systematic review. - Integrated services, where testing, prevention, treatment and care, TB and STI screening, and other relevant services are provided together at a single facility or site;\n- Providing on-site or immediate testing with same-day results;\n- Providing assistance with transport, such as transportation vouchers, if the treatment site is far from the testing service site;\n- Decentralized treatment provision and community-based distribution of treatment;\n- Support and involvement of trained lay providers who are peers and act as peer navigators, expert patients/clients, and community outreach workers to provide support, and identify and reach people lost to follow up;\n- Intensified post-test counselling by community health workers;\n- Using communication technologies, such as mobile phones and text messaging, which may help with disclosure, adherence and retention;\n- Providing brief strengths-based case management, which emphasizes people's selfdetermination and strengths, is client-led and focuses on future outcomes, helps clients set and accomplish goals, establishes good working relationships among the client, health worker and other sources of support in the community, and provides services outside of office settings;\n- Promoting partner testing may increase rates of testing and linkage to care.\nSource: Consolidated guidelines on HIV testing services. Geneva: WHO; 2015 .\nSpecifically, promotion of HBV screening activities by lay health workers increased HBV testing uptake, while clinician reminders to prompt HCV screening during clinical visits increased HCV testing rates. Coordinated care between hepatitis and mental health specialists along with psychological therapy and counselling for patients with mental health and/or substance use comorbidities also increased HCV treatment initiation and treatment completion, and resulted in higher SVR rates. Integration of services among certain populations of individuals with HCV such as PWID may also be useful. The Guidelines Development Group also considered evidence from recent systematic reviews on interventions to improve linkage to care following HIV testing, which was considered relevant to hepatitis care and treatment services.\nFeasibility, acceptability, and resource use Education and support for peer and lay health-care workers. The findings are also consistent with the growing body of evidence demonstrating that lay health workers effectively perform a range of interventions that would otherwise be undertaken by trained medical personnel, strengthen service delivery capacity in a variety of clinical settings in LMICs , and are critical to supporting decentralization of services and nonfacility-based testing. Evidence supports such peer-led interventions as being feasible and acceptable to both those individuals screened and lay health workers themselves . Integrated care. Integrating HCV screening and treatment with mental health and substance use services is feasible and acceptable to targeted clients .\n\n【175】 #Costs and cost-effectiveness\nNone of the studies identified in the systematic review reported estimates of the direct cost or cost-effectiveness of interventions. However, effective linkage to hepatitis care and treatment following a positive diagnosis would be expected to improve programme effectiveness, support earlier treatment initiation and reduce loss to follow up before treatment initiation, thus resulting in potential cost savings along the continuum of care.\n- 5. Implementation considerations 1. Policies on linkage to care. Proactive linkage approaches are a critical component of comprehensive hepatitis testing services. Countries should ensure that they have specific policies and strategies to improve and prioritize linkages between hepatitis testing and prevention, treatment and care services. Interventions that impact on multiple steps along the care continuum will generally be more resource efficient. The effectiveness of linkage will vary for different testing approaches.\n\n【176】 #Linkage to prevention services.\nAs for HIV , a range of prevention services should be available for those diagnosed with hepatitis, as well as for those who test negative. Linkage to prevention services for people who test HBV or HCV negative is not well documented or studied. Supporting linkage to prevention services is particularly important for those with high ongoing risk, such as PWID and serodiscordant couples.\n\n【177】 #Research gaps\nMost existing studies were rated as being of low or very low methodological quality, and there has been a lack of methodologically rigorous studies, in particular, on interventions to promote uptake of HBV and HCV testing, linkage to HBV treatment uptake, and HCV treatment in the era of DAA therapy. There is a need for studies evaluating the effectiveness, costs and cost-effectiveness of packages of different interventions and combinations of interventions to optimize engagement and retention, and treatment outcomes for people living with HBV and HCV along the continuum of care, especially in LMICs.\n\n【178】 #Key elements for national testing services\nThe efficient coordination of testing services at the national level is important for an effective and sustainable national hepatitis testing programme1 summarizes the key elements for countries to consider while planning or further expanding testing for viral hepatitis 4 to ensure the quality and accuracy of testing.\n\n【179】 #IMPLEMENTING LABORATORY TESTING SERVICES FOR VIRAL HEPATITIS\nA national technical working group should be developed to discuss and agree on each of the different laboratory aspects. It should comprise representatives from patient groups and civil society, public and private testing providers, national governmental agencies (national regulatory authorities, directorate of laboratory services, viral hepatitis programmes), laboratory specialists, programme experts, other implementing partners and nongovernmental agencies.\n\n【180】 #National framework for viral hepatitis testing\nA framework approach is useful for guiding national authorities on how to arrange testing services that allow access to all populations that would benefit most from testing and linkage to prevention and antiviral treatment.\n\n【181】 #National hepatitis testing policy\nA national testing policy for viral hepatitis is a statement of intent to provide testing services for viral hepatitis. It should set out the goals and objectives of the national testing services and define who is responsible for testing services at each level of the tiered testing network . It should be complementary to the wider national health policy, with a link to the justice system, given that many key populations at risk of acquiring viral hepatitis live in prisons and other closed settings. The national testing policy may be used to engage and build consensus through active participation with stakeholders for its development. This allows for all implementing partners to understand the national priorities for testing in all settings to reach equity in testing coverage. This document will contribute to the development of a national strategic plan for viral hepatitis that includes testing.\n\n【182】 #National hepatitis strategic plans (including testing)\nA national strategic plan for viral hepatitis  that includes testing should describe how practically testing services will be established and delivered to support different testing objectives, i.e. diagnosis, prevention, surveillance and treatment. It allows for planning of public and private testing services in the context of the different tiers of the testing network (level 0 through to level 4; see Fig. 15.2). Development of national and regional plans should include all relevant stakeholders involved in organizing the structure and network of facilities for hepatitis testing.\nStrategic planning for testing services requires first a situation analysis (or needs assessment) to identify and map all existing facilities (public and private; facilityand community-based) that have the capacity to undertake viral hepatitis testing, with an assessment of their organizational structure, infrastructure, technical and human resources, and financing. A minimum package of testing services to be provided at each of the four levels of the health-care system , as well as at the community level, should be agreed upon and articulated in the plan. Each testing facility will require a specific and sufficient budget, a suitable infrastructure, with some facilities requiring additional infrastructure (such as reliable water and equipment). Plans should also include a monitoring and evaluation mechanism, with a baseline, targets and indicators in order to measure progress and impact.\n\n【183】 #National regulatory mechanisms (for diagnostics, staff and services)\nEach national programme should ensure that there are regulatory mechanisms that can perform oversight functions for the various activities of the viral hepatitis testing programme. These may be carried out by the health authority and health product regulatory authorities or through a designated governmental agency. The scope of regulation should encompass regulatory controls (pre-market and post-market) for IVDs available for sale and use within the country, certification of competency of testing staff, and accreditation of testing services. An effective oversight system gives confidence in the testing services to all stakeholders.\nFor countries that do not currently possess capacity and/or competency to regulate IVDs and other laboratory equipment and items, the WHO prequalification assessment serves as a mechanism to provide an independent assessment of the quality, safety and performance of IVDs that are intended for sale and use in resource-limited settings. A number of guidance documents are available to direct nascent regulators in their capacity-building efforts.\nWHO conducts the prequalification assessment of IVDs using a standardized procedure to determine if the product meets WHO prequalification requirements. The assessment consists of three key components:\n- review of the safety, quality and performance of the assay presented in a product dossier prepared by the manufacturer;\n- desk review of the quality management systems applied during production, followed by a site inspection;\n- independent performance evaluation of performance and operational characteristics.\n\n【184】 15.2\n\n【185】 - provision of QC specimens;\n- organization of quality assessment schemes;\n- training and supervisory support.\n\n【186】 #Building capacity for testing services\nBuilding or expanding existing capacity for viral hepatitis testing services should be considered in the wider framework of expanding access to testing services for a range of related diseases. The rise in use of multi-disease platforms for testing and the need to service coinfected individuals (such as HIV/HCV-coinfected patients) means that development of a trained and motivated health workforce should be considered across disease control programmes.\n\n【187】 #Human resource management\nA range of personnel may be required for the different roles in testing services, including phlebotomists, test operators (laboratory technicians, POC test providers), data clerks and other auxiliary staff All staff should have appropriate qualifications, such as certifications according to national guidelines, and demonstrated proficiency in performing the tasks within their scope of work. Supervisory support to staff and regular site visits as part of a quality assessment system provides an opportunity for troubleshooting and feedback to higher management.\n\n【188】 #Inventory management (procurement and supply chain of assays and reagents)\nContinuity in the supply of test kits, reagents and other consumables required for testing depends on reliable and responsive procurement and supply systems. Stockouts of test kits or essential consumables can contribute to poor testing services. The testing programme should ensure that procurement procedures (either through a centralized medical store or direct from the supplier) are conducted in accordance with best global practice for procurement. Importantly, any bidding or evaluation of bidding should be conducted in a fair and transparent manner.\nTo support inventory management, testing services at user level should have appropriate systems in place to monitor stocks and expiry dates of test kits and reagents, as well a method to track consumption and wastage.\n\n【189】 #Further reading\nForthcoming second edition of Guidance for procurement of in vitro diagnostics and related laboratory items and equipment. Geneva: WHO; 2013.\n\n【190】 #Storage and transportation\nAll test kits and reagents should be transported and stored under controlled conditions, according the manufacturer's instructions for use of the product.\nTesting services should ensure that so-called room temperature-stable test kits such as RDTs are stored according to their labelling.\n\n【191】 #Equipment management\nWhen purchasing diagnostics that require instrumentation, such as analysers (either closed or open platform, polyvalent or otherwise), ancillary equipment (e.g. refrigerator, freezer, incubators), and other equipment that requires installation and validation (e.g. autoclaves, water purification systems), it is necessary to ensure that these are maintained. This means calibration upon installation, as well as preventive and corrective maintenance, which should be foreseen as part of financial planning and procurement procedures.\n\n【192】 #Further reading\nMaintenance manual for laboratory equipment, 2nd edition. Geneva: WHO; 2008 .\n\n【193】 #Laboratory information management systems\nInformation management consists of paper-based and electronic systems for storing records and documents, including laboratory information management systems and mobile mechanisms that provide testing results or reminders to health-care facility staff or clients. It is closely linked to documentation and record-keeping.\nTo assure the quality and integrity of the test status given to a client, the testing service must minimize the risk of transcription errors. Assigning patient identification numbers and specimen identification numbers to each subsequent specimen received from the same individual will serve to reduce the possibility of transcription errors. It will also protect the confidentiality of people undergoing testing.\n\n【194】 #Product selection\nWhile a testing strategy provides a generic approach to how many assays should be used and how many tests should be conducted on each assay, a testing algorithm defines the specific products (assay by brand name) to be used in a given testing strategy. The design of a testing algorithm will be determined by the specific disease marker to be tested for, and operational aspects such as the required expertise of the users, infrastructure and testing conditions, and assay characteristics. Selection should include some consideration of products that have been approved by (i.e. conforms to requirements of) stringent regulatory assessment, such as by the WHO prequalification programme or any of the founding members of the Global Harmonization Task Force (GHTF) 5 . If there are no products available that meet these quality criteria (WHO prequalified or stringent review by GHTF founding member), then efforts should be made to review any other existing quality certification held by the manufacturer for the product of intended supply. This might include a request from the supplier to provide\n- a list of all quality reviews conducted on the product;\n- all internationally recognized standards such as ISO 13485 or equivalent.\nThe performance of potential candidate assays may have been published as independent performance evaluations in the peer-reviewed literature. The Standards for Reporting Diagnostic Accuracy (STARD) criteria should be used to exclude low-quality studies .\n\n【195】 #Monitoring testing algorithms\nA periodic assessment of the programmatic performance of diagnostics should be conducted. For example, when testing for HCV, if there are low rates of HCV viraemia in those that are HCV-antibody seropositive, this might indicate that there are high rates of false-positive results (poor specificity) for the serological assay(s). Conversely, if seroprevalence rates are low but a higher proportion are found to have detectable HCV RNA, then the possibility of false-negative results should be considered. Either scenario should trigger further revalidation of the testing algorithm to facilitate the selection of assays with increased sensitivity and/or specificity.\nThe following quality indicators should be monitored, as appropriate:\n- rate of defective consumables, e.g. specimen transfer pipettes, lancets;\n- rate of invalid test devices (if single-use devices such as RDTs);\n- rate of equipment breakdown and respective down-time rate of out-of-range QC results; and - rate of discrepant results within a testing algorithm consisting of two or more assays.\n\n【196】 #Post-market surveillance of diagnostics\nOnce a product is placed on the market, its quality, safety and performance must be monitored to ensure that diagnostics continue to meet standards. WHO has established a system for post-market surveillance of diagnostics that supplements the obligations of manufacturers, who must also conduct their own post-market evaluation activities.\nIn this context, post-market surveillance consists of the following:\n- proactive post-market surveillance (to identify any problem before use) through in-country lot verification testing, both before and after distribution of test kits to testing sites; and - reactive post-market surveillance (when a problem has been identified during the use of the diagnostic) through reporting and evaluation of complaints, including reports of adverse events, and any required actions to correct the problem and prevent recurrence.\nLot verification testing conducted independently of the manufacturer is particularly useful where manufacturing quality has not been adequately assured, and to verify that an assay has minimal lot-to-lot variation .\n- 5. Assuring the quality of testing services 15.5.1. Quality management systems, irrespective of the testing setting\nEffective quality management systems are essential for the overall effectiveness of a hepatitis testing programme. It should encompass all activities of the testing programme and not be limited to laboratories only, but include testing in healthand community-based facilities.\nAny site conducting hepatitis testing should implement a quality management system that incorporates the 12 interconnected components summarized in Fig. 15.1. Many of these components have already been described in the context of the national framework for organizing testing services for viral hepatitis . Quality assurance (QA) should be seen as an integral part of the continuing roles and responsibilities of each and every staff member. Through this QA framework, countries can plan, implement, evaluate, improve and sustain QA activities. Such frameworks and provisions apply not only to test accuracy but also to ensuring the quality of pre-test information and post-test counselling.\n\n【197】 #Quality control\nQuality control (QC), also known as process control, refers to processes and activities to ensure that testing procedures are performed correctly, that environmental conditions are suitable and that the assay works as expected.\nThe intention of QC is to detect, evaluate and correct errors due to assay failure, environmental conditions or operator performance before results are reported. Hence, QC is a multistep process with certain checkpoints throughout the testing process.\nBefore testing (pre-analytical)\n- Ensure the appropriate sample type and/or volume has been used.\n- Check the expiry of test kits and required consumables. While testing (analytical)\n- Ensure that any QC specimens have been run (e.g. test kit controls and/ or external QC specimen) and that the results are within QC acceptance criteria. - Ensure that a test result is read correctly. After testing (post-analytical)\n- Double-check the report of test status to the client.\nInternal QC refers to processes within the assay that check whether the test procedure is working; the appearance of a control line for HBsAg or anti-HCV RDTs is an example of internal QC.\nAs an addition to the test kit controls, external quality control specimens may be produced Many errors occur due to incorrect transcription of testing results and reporting of the status. All necessary steps should be taken to mitigate these errors such as rechecking the reports and re-reading visually read assays independently by a second individual .\n\n【198】 #Personnel and training\nAll testing services must employ an adequate number of trained, certified and supported personnel to conduct each of the elements of hepatitis B and C testing for the expected number of tests conducted and the number of people being served. Testing for serological markers of HBV and HCV infection may take place at any level of the health-care system and for virological tests at levels 2 to 4. Fig. 15.2 depicts how testing services are typically organized, with the different assays formats that could feasibly be available at each of the levels when their operational characteristics and other factors such as need for phlebotomy are considered. The degree of physical infrastructure required for each assay format, such as the need for reliable electricity to store reagents and climate-controlled testing rooms to run tests, as well as the staff skills and competencies required, will determine how complex the assay can be for a given testing setting. With further expanded use of RDTs, more people could access testing at the primary care level (level 1).\n\n【199】 #Specimen types and collection methods\nSpecimen integrity is critical to the accuracy of testing3 provides a broad summary of specimen types and processing requirements, but each manufacturer specifies in the instructions for use the recommended specimen collection procedures, the storage requirements and specimen stability after collection, and these instructions should always take precedence. Where the instructions for use do not include a certain specimen type within the intended use, it indicates that the assay manufacturer has not yet validated that specimen type for use with their assay.\nSerum/plasma specimens are most commonly used for testing of HBV and HCV, both serological testing and NAT. However, taking whole blood specimens using venepuncture requires technical skill and proficiency, with the need for additional processing steps to generate serum/plasma from the venous whole blood, which requires a centrifuge and refrigerated storage facilities. Collection of oral fluid and capillary whole blood is less invasive than venepuncture. However, oral fluid testing is currently limited to serological tests, and may have lower sensitivity than testing performed on capillary whole blood or serum/ plasma specimens.\nFreshly collected whole blood is allowed to coagulate, and serum fraction is collected away from the clotted red blood cells.\n- Collect whole blood, mix by hand 4-5 times immediately and let stand for the clot to form. - Process within 30 minutes of collection.\n- Store at 2-8 °C. Test within 5 days or as specified by the instructions for the assay to be used.\n\n【200】 #Capillary whole blood\nCapillary (finger-stick) whole blood is collected using a lancet and a specimen transfer device.\n- Use the specimen immediately, with the specimen transfer device recommended by the instructions for use. - Note that the specimen transfer device may or may not include an anticoagulant. An anticoagulant contributes to accuracy.\n\n【201】 #Oral fluid\nOral mucosal transudate (not saliva) is collected from the gums using a collection device.\n- Use the specimen immediately, with the specimen transfer device recommended in the instructions for use.\n\n【202】 #Dried blood spot (DBS)\nVenous or capillary whole blood is applied to a filter paper by hanging drop or microcapillary action. Whole blood is later eluted from the filter paper and used for the test procedure.\n- Store at 4 °C for up to 3 months, or at -20 °C for longer. - Use of specific assays with DBS should be validated by the manufacturer. If the manufacturer has not validated their assay for DBS, the use of DBS is considered \"off-label\", or unauthorized for returning medical results.\nIt also discusses post-test counselling for individuals who are diagnosed with chronic HBV or HCV infection, as well as those who test negative or who have an inconclusive result.\n\n【203】 #Key points\n- The 5 \"Cs\" are essential for all hepatitis testing services: consent, confidentiality, counselling, correct test results and connection to hepatitis prevention, treatment and care.\n- Verbal consent is usually adequate, but all individuals should have an opportunity to refuse testing. Mandatory testing is never warranted.\n- Viral hepatitis testing services must ensure that all test results and client information are confidential. Although disclosure to supportive family members and health workers is often beneficial, this must be done only with the consent of the person being tested.\n- Everyone who is diagnosed positive for hepatitis B or hepatitis C should receive post-test counselling. People who test negative for hepatitis B or C will usually need only brief health information about how to prevent acquisition of viral hepatitis in the future, where and how to link to prevention services, as appropriate, and be offered HBV vaccination. People with significant ongoing risk such as PWID may need more active support and linkage to harm reduction services.\n- Connection or linkage to prevention, treatment and care is an essential component of viral hepatitis testing.\n\n【204】 #Promoting testing awareness\nDepending on the current levels of knowledge and awareness of hepatitis in different countries and settings, general promotion and awareness campaigns for viral hepatitis testing and where it is available may be necessary. This may include promotion through the mass media, including radio, television, billboards and posters, the Internet and electronic social media. In other countries, promotional activities may need to focus on specific populations in whom viral hepatitis testing rates remain suboptimal, such as PWID. There is also a need for clear signs, printed information, posters that direct clients to where testing is available in health facilities (such as ANC, STI and TB clinics), the community or through mobile services and social media.\n\n【205】 #Creating an enabling environment\nCritical enablers are strategies, activities and approaches (generally outside the purview of the health sector) that are key to the success of health sector interventions. Addressing such critical enablers as reducing stigma and discrimination, empowering the community and reviewing certain national laws, policies and practice can help strengthen interventions to support the uptake of viral hepatitis testing and linkages to prevention, care and treatment.\nIn particular, it can improve the accessibility, acceptability, uptake, equitable coverage, quality, effectiveness and efficiency of viral hepatitis interventions, especially among populations that are reluctant to use or have limited access to current hepatitis testing, such as PWID.\n\n【206】 #The WHO 5 \"Cs\"\nThe WHO 5 \"Cs\" are principles that apply to all models of HIV and hepatitis testing and in all settings  .\n1 \"The 5 Cs\" for hepatitis testing services\n- Consent. People being tested for hepatitis B or C must give informed consent to be tested and counselled. Verbal consent is sufficient, and they should be informed of the process for testing and of their right to decline. Provision of information about testing and the need for consent can be delivered in a group setting, such as group health education, but clients should give consent in an individual and private manner. Health workers should carefully explain how a client can decline testing and ensure that no one coerces clients into being tested, and each person has a private opportunity to opt out of testing.\nAlthough confidentiality should always be respected, it should not be allowed to reinforce secrecy, stigma or shame. Counsellors should discuss, among other issues, whom the person may wish to inform and how they would like this to be done. Shared confidentiality with a partner or family members and health-care providers is often highly beneficial.\n- Connection. Linkage to prevention, treatment and care services should include effective and appropriate follow up, including long-term prevention and treatment support.\n\n【207】 #Providing pre-test information\nWith the increasing availability of RDTs, many people will receive their initial serology test results on the same day as testing. Therefore, intensive pre-test counselling is not needed and may create barriers to service delivery. Depending on local conditions and resources, programmes may provide pre-test information through individual or group information sessions and through media such as posters, brochures, websites and short video clips shown in waiting rooms.\nWhen testing children and adolescents, information should be presented in an age-appropriate way to ensure comprehension.\nOffering or recommending viral hepatitis testing to a client or a group of clients includes providing clear and concise information on:\n- viral hepatitis and the benefits of testing for hepatitis B or C; and the meaning of a positive and negative test result;\n- a brief description of prevention options;\n- the confidentiality of the test result, as well as any information shared by the client;\n- the potential negative consequences of testing to the client in settings where certain sexual or injecting drug use behaviour is stigmatized or even criminalized, or where a positive test could result in discrimination, for example, with regard to employment or with insurance policies where there may be financial consequences of either taking a test or of a positive result. In addition, the practical implications of a positive test result should be explained, including when there is no treatment currently available.\n- 5. Post-test counselling and services 16.5.1. For those who test positive\nHealth workers, professional counsellors, social workers and trained lay providers can provide counselling. The information and counselling that health workers or others should provide to HBV-or HCV-positive clients is listed below. However, counselling should always be responsive to and tailored to the unique situation of each individual.\n- Explain the test results and diagnosis.\n- Provide clear information on further tests required to confirm viraemic infection and stage of liver disease, indications for treatment for both HBV and HCV and its benefits, as well as where and how to obtain the appropriate care and treatment (and advice if treatment is not currently available).\n- Make an active referral for viral hepatitis clinical care for a specific time and date, i.e. tester makes an appointment or if services are co-located, accompanies the client to an appointment.\n- Counselling on lifestyle. This includes assessment of alcohol consumption and advice on alcohol reduction (the WHO ASSIST package includes Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test), diet and physical activity.\n- Discuss possible disclosure of the result and the risks and benefits of disclosure, particularly among couples and partners. Offer couples counselling to support mutual disclosure.\n- Encourage and offer HBV and HCV testing for family members, including children, and sexual partners. This can be done individually, through couples testing or partner notification.\nA peer counsellor may particularly help people understand the diagnosis and support linkage to care and treatment by serving as a \"peer navigator\", who assists with finding, choosing and obtaining a full range of services, and can potentially increase the proportion of people who start treatment.g. pregnant and postpartum women, adolescents, and children.\n\n【208】 #For those who test negative\nIndividuals who test negative for HBV or HCV infection should receive brief health information about their test results. In general, a lengthy counselling session is not necessary and may divert counselling resources that are needed by those who test positive. Counselling for those who test negative should include the following, particularly in high-prevalence settings:\n- an explanation of the negative test result;\n- an offer of HBV vaccination and education on methods to prevent acquisition, and referral to harm reduction prevention services, as appropriate;\n- repeat testing for HCV based on the client's level of recent exposure and/or ongoing risk of exposure. The majority of individuals do not require retesting to verify a negative test, particularly in the absence of any ongoing risk. However, certain individuals who test negative warrant retesting because of an ongoing risk, especially for HCV, but also for HBV if they have not yet been vaccinated. These include the following: persons from high-risk populations, such as PWID, sex workers and MSM; persons with a known HBsAg-or HCV RNA-positive partner or family member; pregnant women in high-prevalence settings (at each pregnancy); individuals seen for a diagnosis or treatment of HIV or STIs;\n- encouraging the client to return for a further test to confirm the diagnosis when the hepatitis status is inconclusive\n\n【209】 #Key points\n- Viral hepatitis testing can be delivered in different populations and different settings through both health-care facility-based testing and community-based testing.\n- Many of these approaches have successfully increased the coverage and impact of HIV testing, and can be applied to the delivery of viral hepatitis testing.\n- Health-care facilities for testing are primary care clinics and outpatient clinics that include specialist clinics such as HIV, STI and TB clinics, antenatal clinics, OST services, as well as inpatient wards in district, provincial and regional hospitals, and private clinical services. Community-based testing can be offered through outreach/ mobile, home-based or door-to-door approaches, in schools and other educational establishments, and in workplaces, places of worship, parks, bars and other venues.\n- Effective health system programme practices that may be appropriate for increasing access to hepatitis testing in some settings include integration with other health services (e.g. HIV), decentralization of testing to primary care facilities and outside the health system (e.g. workplaces, schools, places of worship), and task-sharing of testing responsibilities to other health workers, including trained lay providers.\n- Countries need to identify the most strategic mix of facility-and community-based testing opportunities (as well as the use of integration, decentralization and task-sharing) to best reach those with undiagnosed infection and populations at high risk .\n\n【210】 #Health-care facility-based testing and provider-initiated testing and counselling\nHealth facility-based viral hepatitis testing refers to testing provided in a health facility or laboratory setting. There are several approaches to facility-based testing.\nProvider or practitioner-initiated testing and counselling (PITC) denotes testing that is routinely offered at a health facility , as well as for persons who request testing or who exhibit clinical signs, symptoms or laboratory results that could indicate HBV or HCV infection. It includes provision of pre-test information and obtaining consent, with the option for individuals to decline testing. Although voluntary counselling and testing (VCT) in stand-alone facilities was an early model for delivering HIV testing, it was recognized that offering testing in clinical sites as part of general medical care through PITC  resulted in increased HIV testing uptake, coverage and case detection. It also helped normalize testing by removing the potential reluctance of clients to request a test . PITC for hepatitis can be implemented and integrated in a number of clinical settings, as summarized below, and these represent major opportunities for scaling up viral hepatitis testing.\nHIV clinics. In many populations and high-risk groups, prevalence of HIV and HBV or HCV is high, and there are also high rates of HIV/HBV or HIV/ HCV coinfection . Existing HIV and ART programmes provide an important opportunity to integrate testing for viral hepatitis with that for HIV . with a high uptake of testing . Extension to include targeted HBV and HCV testing is also likely to be feasible and acceptable.\nDrug treatment and harm reduction services. Many innovative models of care to provide integrated hepatitis and OST services for PWID in community drug treatment services have been developed and effectively implemented, mostly in developed countries ,196,362,377. Many of these programmes provide additional interventions, including education, harm reduction, mental health services, other general medical services, and direct provision of referrals to care and treatment Studies also show that multidisciplinary care with integration of other services (e.g. drug and alcohol support, psychiatric services) at the same primary-care setting are acceptable and particularly effective for these populations, who often have multiple health comorbidities and complex needs ,417. Peer-led models, or provider-led models with peer support, can be particularly effective in enabling integration of services in one place in a way that is acceptable to certain high-risk groups such as PWID. Electronic medical records (EMR) have been successfully used to identify and flag higher-risk patients for viral hepatitis testing in several primary-care clinic and hospital-based programmes .\n\n【211】 #Community-based testing\nCommunity-based testing can complement facility-based approaches, which may fail to reach certain high-risk populations, especially PWID, who are often marginalized because of stigma and discrimination or legal sanctions, as well as those in remote or rural areas, including pregnant women with limited access to facility-based testing. There is some evidence that offering hepatitis testing in community settings may increase testing acceptance and uptake, achieve earlier diagnosis, reach first-time testers and people who seldom use clinical services  .\nMobile/Outreach testing approaches include outreach to community sites through mobile vans or tents, at community sites such as churches, mosques or other faith settings, in places of entertainment such as bars and clubs, at cruising sites. Such services may be offered on a regular schedule, at night (\"moonlight testing\"), or as a one-time or occasional promoted event, linked to public events, such as sports events, music performances, theatre, agricultural fairs and holiday festivals.\nDoor-to-door/home-based testing takes place in the home. There are two main models: (i) testing that is offered door to door and provided to all consenting individuals, couples or families in a geographical area; and (ii) testing that is offered to households with an index patient (i.e. persons known to have HIV, viral hepatitis or active or presumptive TB), with consent obtained from the index patient before the home visit. Door-to-door testing during the daytime may reach only people who are not working and younger children, while services during the evening or on weekends may increase uptake among others, such as men. National testing campaigns are nationwide efforts to increase access to and uptake of testing. Some have focused on testing in facilities while others have used a community-based approach or a combination of the two. Outcomes have varied with regard to coverage of different population groups, linkage and costeffectiveness. A national or regional hepatitis testing campaign has the potential to reach a significant proportion of the population, which includes both those known to be at risk as well as those not at risk for HBV or HCV infection . However, experience with national HIV campaigns has shown that they can be expensive, and that a substantial number of people with HIV remain undiagnosed. In addition, linkage to care and treatment from campaigns has been problematic. Mass media and social media. Knowledge of hepatitis testing and availability is limited in many countries, and there is a need for promotion and awareness campaigns in the general population. Some countries and programmes promote viral hepatitis testing and education through the mass media, including radio, television, billboards and posters, the Internet and electronic social media . This approach has also been used to facilitate more targeted and efficient screening in regions of low prevalence. This also applies to testing in health facilities, in the community and through mobile services . The WHO-recommended effective health programming practices of integration with other health services; decentralization to primary health-care facilities as well as outside the health system (e.g. workplaces, schools, places of worship); and taskshifting of responsibilities to increase the role of trained lay providers were originally developed to improve the delivery of HIV testing  . Inclusion of one or more of these practices may improve the accessibility of hepatitis testing, and onward linkage to services and support in some settings. With the availability of simplified viral hepatitis diagnostic tests and treatment regimens, decentralization and task-shifting or -sharing in particular can be increasingly used in service delivery models to scale up hepatitis testing and treatment, especially in settings where there is limited access to hospital facilities and laboratory services .\n\n【212】 #Integration of viral hepatitis testing with other services\nIntegration involves not only providing related services in a single setting, but also linking recording and reporting systems to share information and referrals between settings and providers. There is already a range of clinical services for which WHO recommends the integration of HIV testing, and this may also apply to hepatitis testing in some settings . These include clinical services for TB, HIV, maternal and child health, sexual and reproductive health (STI clinics), mental health and harm reduction programmes for PWID, migrant and refugee services, and persons in prisons . Integration with HIV testing and treatment services will be particularly appropriate in HBV and HCV epidemic settings where the HIV prevalence is also high. The primary purpose of such integration is to make HBV, HCV and HIV testing more convenient for people coming to health facilities for other reasons, and so expand the reach and uptake of viral hepatitis testing. For the patient, integration of hepatitis testing into other health services may facilitate addressing other health needs at the same time, saving time and money. For the health system, integration may reduce duplication of services and improve coordination, for example, in stock management, overall efficiency and cost-effectiveness.\nThe goal of programme collaboration is to create integrated delivery systems that best facilitate access to and increase the impact of hepatitis testing, treatment and other health services. Aspects of coordination across programmes that need consideration include: mobilizing, allocating and sharing resources (including multitasking and task-shifting of human resources to increase the availability of highly skilled workers); training, mentoring and supervising health workers; procuring and managing medicines, test kits and other medical supplies; maintaining the quality of testing; and reducing stigma and discrimination .\n\n【213】 #Decentralization of hepatitis testing services\nDecentralization of services refers to delivery of services provided in peripheral health facilities, community-based venues and locations beyond urban hospital sites, nearer to patients' homes. This may reduce transportation costs and waiting times experienced in central hospitals and, therefore, improve uptake of testing. Decentralization of HIV treatment services, in high-burden LMICs was a key component of the global scale up of HIV services and successfully improved uptake of testing and reduced loss to follow up . To date, delivery of viral hepatitis testing and treatment has in general relied on specialist-led centralized models of care in hospital settings . Currently, there are only a few successful models of decentralized viral hepatitis testing and treatment for hard-to-reach populations and general populations at high risk . With the development of simpler diagnostic tests for HBV and HCV, and simpler and more effective treatment regimens for HCV, decentralization has the potential to also increase the uptake of hepatitis testing.\n\n【214】 10 Decentralization\nIn Taiwan, a community-based outreach model delivering free testing for HBV and HCV and targeting the general population has been successfully implemented since 1996, and identified a high overall seroprevalence of both HBV and HCV (17.3% and 4.4%, respectively) and significant geographical variations in prevalence .\n\n【215】 Hepatitis Testing Innovation Contest, 2016\nDecentralization of services, however, may not always be appropriate for or acceptable to potential users. In some settings, centralized viral hepatitis services can provide greater anonymity than neighbourhood services for highrisk populations or others who fear stigma and discrimination. Also, in some low-prevalence settings, decentralizing hepatitis testing may be inefficient and costly. Context, needs, access to laboratory infrastructure and tests, and overall costs and benefits should inform decisions about where hepatitis testing should be decentralized. Decentralization of testing services will also require access to quality-assured RDTs, and DBS specimen collection and analysis.\n\n【216】 #Task-shifting or -sharing in delivery of hepatitis testing\nMany countries, including those affected by HBV, HCV and HIV epidemics, continue to face shortages of trained health workers. Task-shifting is a pragmatic response to health workforce shortages. It seeks to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of available personnel and so enable the existing workforce to provide testing services to more people.\nSeveral systematic reviews from different areas of health care support the general conclusion that good health outcomes can be achieved by devolving tasks to nurses and lay or community health workers , with appropriate training and supervision. Task-shifting has been adopted for over a decade to expand HIV testing across the Americas , Europe .\nIn a similar way, task-shifting may also be important for scale up of hepatitis testing, particularly in settings with high HBV or HCV prevalence in the general population or subpopulations . Incorporation of viral hepatitis testing into existing task-shifting models of care providing HIV services could be an effective and cost-effective means of fulfilling these objectives. Peerled interventions have also been effective in increasing viral hepatitis testing, care and treatment for marginalized groups of PWID. In addition to providing services, peers can act as role models and offer non-judgemental and respectful support that may contribute to reducing stigma, facilitating access to services and improving their acceptability . However, increasing task-shifting and broadening the scope of responsibilities of trained lay providers will not alone fully rectify staff shortages and poor-quality services.\n\n【217】 11 Task-shifting\nThere is emerging evidence from high-income countries that task-shifting can help deliver effective HCVrelated services to vulnerable key populations with outcomes comparable to specialist-level care .\nSource: Hepatitis Testing Innovation Contest, 2016\n\n【218】 #Diagnostic innovations to promote access to testing\nAdvances in hepatitis virus detection technology have created new opportunities for enhancing hepatitis testing, as well as monitoring the response to treatment.\nSimplified testing algorithms. Simplifying testing algorithms will be critical to ensuring affordability and the success of scaling up testing. Potential future testing approaches for HCV infection are the adoption of a less expensive and more manageable single virological test for both diagnosis and confirmation of viraemia . However, this may only ever be cost-effective in high-prevalence settings and high-risk populations.\nNear patient or POC testing. The development of reliable, accurate, practical and affordable near patient tests will be crucial for expanding hepatitis testing services, especially in community-based settings. POC technologies for viral hepatitis include molecular NAT-based tests for diagnosis and treatment monitoring. These emerging POC devices are able to perform conventional laboratory molecular testing (qualitative and quantitative) in field settings; are easier to use than the laboratory-based NAT assays, as they require minimum training and hands-on time; can be operated on battery or conventional power source; do not require phlebotomy; and provide a result within 2 hours. They include cartridge-based HCV RNA assays, which can be used with existing diagnostic platforms developed for TB or HIV early infant diagnosis and viral load monitoring, but HCVcAg POC platforms are also in development. They offer the possibility of a same-day diagnosis of viraemic infection, either alone or when combined with an HCV antibody RDT, as well as test of cure.\nMultiplex and multi-disease analysers. Multiplex or multi-disease analysers allow for integrated testing of hepatitis B and C alongside other pathogens, e.g. HIV and syphilis, and can leverage technology developed for other infectious disease programmes. Key advantages include the requirement for lower specimen volume, improved client flow with results for multiple pathogens available at the same time, and so fewer patient visits and transport costs. Multiplex RDTs are in development for anti-HIV/anti-HCV, anti-HIV/syphilis/anti-HCV, anti-HIV/syphilis/HBsAg and anti-HIV/ anti-HCV/HBsAg. Data on their diagnostic accuracy and impact on patient-important outcomes are required before adoption.\nSelf-testing. Self-testing is a process in which an individual, who wants to know his or her status collects a specimen, performs a test and interprets the result themselves, often in private. HIV self-testing (HIVST) is now being conducted in many settings. Most studies report that HIVST is highly acceptable across a variety of populations , and has increased uptake of testing among people not reached by other existing HIV testing services, many of whom are first-time testers . The experience with hepatitis self-testing is currently very limited, but it represents a potentially important approach to expand access to testing in the future. This includes PWID; persons in prisons or closed settings; MSM; sex workers; transgender people; persons living with HIV; TB-infected populations; migrant and mobile populations; healthcare workers; couples, partners and household contacts; pregnant women; children; and adolescents.\n\n【219】 #Principles for testing in all populations\n- Hepatitis testing must emphasize the WHO 5 \"Cs\". Mandatory, compulsory or coercive testing is never appropriate .\n- All sites that provide hepatitis testing should have SOPs and ethical codes of conduct. They should protect client information and confidentiality, and should employ trained and supervised health workers (including lay providers).\n- Testing should be part of a care pathway that includes access to prevention, treatment and vaccination services. All persons who test positive for HBV and HCV should be linked to hepatitis care and treatment services.\n- Priority for testing is to diagnose the undiagnosed as well as to identify those both in greatest need of treatment and at greatest risk of transmitting infection.\n\n【220】 #Principles for testing in key and high-risk populations\nIn some countries, HIV, HBV and HCV infections occur predominantly in certain key or high-risk populations, often via common routes of transmission. Key populations include PWID, MSM, people in prisons and other closed settings, sex workers and transgender people. These populations not only have an increased risk of infection, but their behaviours are often stigmatized, discriminated and criminalized. In almost all countries and settings, hepatitis testing for these key and priority populations is inadequate, and access to prevention, care and treatment services remains low.\n- Promotion of health equity and human rights in hepatitis B and C testing is critical, as many of the affected populations such as PWID, prisoners, MSM, and sex workers are those who are systematically excluded from access to testing, treatment and care. Expanded testing and access should be fair, equitable and voluntary, and provided in a supportive environment free of stigma and discrimination.\n- Essential strategies to create an enabling environment for access to hepatitis testing and treatment in these populations include: supportive legislation, policy and financial commitment, such as decriminalization of behaviours of key populations; addressing stigma and discrimination and violence against people from key populations; and community empowerment. In prisons, this can also include addressing additional systemic barriers contributing to transmission of viral hepatitis and other infectious diseases, such as confined unhygienic living spaces, lack of access to clean drinking water and adequate nutrition .\n- Full HBV vaccination or adoption of a catch-up vaccination programme is recommended for certain populations at increased risk of HBV, including PWID, MSM , sex workers and prisoners, without the need for prior HBsAg testing.\n- Provision of accessible testing and treatment services.\n° Integration of testing and service delivery. To facilitate access, testing in certain populations such as PWID should be integrated, where possible, with delivery of other harm-reduction or drug dependency services and HIV testing .\nTraining of health-care workers. In many settings, health-care workers lack experience or training on how to provide inclusive and nonjudgemental testing, and there are reports of discrimination against high-risk populations. Countries should prioritize the training of health workers so that they can provide acceptable services, better understand the needs of these populations, and be familiar with local support and prevention services. Similarly, services for transgender persons should be welcoming, with staff who are respectful and sensitive to transgender issues, and are knowledgeable about transgender medical concerns, such as the integration of hormone therapy and hepatitis care.\nThose who have been previously infected should be retested using RNA testing, as the antibody remains positive after the first infection.\n\n【221】 #Persons living with HIV\nConcurrent infection with HIV usually results in more severe and progressive liver disease, and a higher incidence of cirrhosis, HCC and mortality .\nHIV-infected persons are therefore a priority group for early diagnosis of viral hepatitis coinfection, and provision of both ART and specific antiviral therapy.\n\n【222】 #Implementation considerations\n- Comparable outcomes of DAA therapy have been seen in persons with HIV coinfection as for those with HCV monoinfection, with cure rates higher than 95%, even for those with prior HCV treatment failure or advanced fibrosis . Therefore, there is no longer a need to consider HIV/HCV-coinfected patients as a special, difficult-to-treat patient population.\n- HBV vaccination. The risk of HBV infection may be higher in HIV-infected adults, and therefore all persons newly diagnosed with HIV should be screened for HBsAg and anti-HBs to identify those with CHB, and vaccinated if non-immune. Response to HBV vaccine may be lower in HIVinfected persons especially those with a low CD4 count. A schedule using four double (40 µg) doses of the vaccine provides a higher protective anti-HBs titre than the regular three 20 µg dose schedule .\n\n【223】 #Tuberculosis-infected populations\nCertain groups, such as PWID and people in prisons who at increased risk of HCV and HBV infection, are also at risk of infection with TB, largely because they live in regions and/or settings (e.g. prisons or regions of the world) that are endemic for these infections .\n\n【224】 #Implementation considerations\n- Supporting intensified tuberculosis case-finding at testing facilities.\nScreening for active TB should be part of the clinical evaluation of patients being considered for HBV and/or HCV and HIV treatment. WHO recommends a four-symptom screening algorithm to rule out active TB . In the absence of a cough, weight loss, fever and night sweats, active TB can be confidently ruled out. In the presence of these symptoms, further investigations for TB would be recommended.\n- Drug interactions. Drug-induced liver injury is three-to sixfold higher in persons coinfected with HBV, HCV or HIV who are receiving antituberculosis drugs. All existing DAA combination regimens interact with rifampicin, but there are no serious interactions anticipated between sofosbuvir or daclatasvir and multidrug-resistant (MDR) or extensively drug-resistant (XDR)-TB regimens .\n\n【225】 #Migrant and mobile populations\nIn some low-prevalence HBV and HCV regions, such as North America, Europe and Australia, the prevalence of viral hepatitis infection among persons born in high-and intermediate-endemic countries is higher, and reflects that in their country of origin. In other settings, minority ethnic groups and other mobile populations such as migrant workers, refugees, asylum seekers, fisher folk and lorry drivers, are particularly vulnerable to HBV, HCV and HIV infection. All these groups can be hard to reach and have difficulty in accessing health care for HIV or hepatitis testing services because of stigma, language differences, discrimination and legal barriers . Displacement of populations through human trafficking may further complicate the provision of testing services .\n\n【226】 #Implementation considerations\n- Knowledge of the underlying prevalence of viral hepatitis as well as other important diseases of public health significance in migrants and refugees is key for an effective country programme.\n- Barriers to testing uptake among migrant groups, such as language and cultural barriers, need to be addressed in order to increase uptake of testing .\nThere is evidence that provision of information and education on hepatitis B to migrant populations may improve knowledge about risk, screening and prevention , but not necessarily lead to increased uptake of testing.\n- Persons who have travelled to high-prevalence countries and had an invasive procedure, including tattoos, acupuncture, body piercings, with equipment that may not have been properly sterilized, or those who may have engaged in high-risk sexual behaviours or injecting drug use should also be considered for targeted testing.\n\n【227】 #Health-care workers\nDue to the risks associated with occupational exposure to blood and body fluids, health-care workers are a population at risk for acquisition of both hepatitis B and C infection. Exposure to blood and bodily fluids can occur through needle-stick and other sharps injuries, contact with blood and bodily fluids through scratches, abrasions or burns on the skin as well as mucosal surfaces of the eyes, nose, or mouth through accidental splashes . However, the largest proportion of occupational transmission of viral hepatitis is due to percutaneous injury via needles during vascular access . The risk of HBV transmission with such exposure is estimated to be 6-30% and for HCV transmission around 1.8% .\n\n【228】 #Implementation considerations\nIn all settings, testing for hepatitis B (and in many settings for hepatitis C) and the offer of HBV vaccination to health-care workers who are non-immune should be standard practice, but this is currently not widely implemented in LMICs.\n- Infection control and injection safety. In settings where infection control practices and occupational health and safety standards are inadequate, testing initiatives should take place alongside improvements in safety standards and procedures to protect health-care workers against possible exposure.\n- Post-exposure prophylaxis. In the event of exposure to HBV, post-exposure prophylaxis with HBV vaccine and HBIG should be made available for health-care workers exposed to HBV where the worker has not received vaccination or where the antibody response to HBV vaccination is unknown.\n- Early diagnosis and management of chronic hepatitis B and C infection should be available to all health-care workers where occupational transmission of HBV or HCV has occurred. Those who are HBsAg positive and undertake exposureprone procedures, such as surgeons, gynaecologists, nurses, phlebotomists, personal care attendants and dentists, should be considered for HBV antiviral therapy to reduce direct transmission to others, and DAA therapy for HCV.\n\n【229】 #Couples, partners, family members and household contacts\nTesting of couples and partners, family members and household contacts of persons with CHB infection, may be an efficient and effective way of identifying additional people with HBV infection who can also benefit from treatment and monitoring. This may also enable adoption of prevention strategies by the couple or family members (e.g. HBV vaccination, condom use, safe injecting practices) . Although the risk of HCV transmission to household contacts and sexual partners among heterosexual and HIV-negative MSM partners is low, there is a small but increased risk among sexual partners of PWID and MSM who engage in high-risk sexual behaviours or are HIV positive. An increasing number of countries offer couples and partner HIV testing  in various settings, including ANC, community-based TB services, and HIV/ART clinics, and this can also inform the service delivery of partner testing for viral hepatitis.\n\n【230】 #Implementation considerations\n- Couples counselling requires additional training and enhanced counselling skills. Providers must be aware of the potential for intimate partner-based violence and should accept people's decisions not to test with their partners.\nTesting for couples who ask to be tested together promotes mutual disclosure of status and increases adoption of prevention measures, especially in the case of discordant couples.\n\n【231】 #Further reading\nGuidance on couples HIV testing and counselling -including antiretroviral therapy for treatment and prevention in serodiscordant couples: recommendations for a public health approach.\n\n【232】 #Pregnant women\nHepatitis B infection. Universal HBV testing in pregnant women already occurs in many parts of the world, but remains suboptimal in resource-limited settings 1 summarizes the existing WHO guidelines on HBV infection prevention in newborns , but the most important preventive strategy is to deliver the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine as soon as possible after birth, preferably within 24 hours followed by at least two timely subsequent doses.\nRecent studies have suggested that there may also be a role for antiviral therapy in the third trimester in HBV-infected pregnant women to further reduce the risk of MTCT .\nHepatitis C infection. Although the risk of MTCT of HCV infection is much lower than that of HBV infection, perinatal transmission of HCV occurs in between 4% and 8% of births, but the risk is two to three times higher if the mother is coinfected with HIV . Although the costs of implementing HCV testing alongside HIV and HBV is likely to be low, there is currently no effective public health intervention to decrease the risk of MTCT of HCV infection. However, identifying pregnant women who are HCV positive allows avoidance of procedures that promote mixing of fetal and maternal blood (e.g. use of scalp electrodes, amniocentesis), and may thus decrease transmission risk . It can also help promote testing of the child at 18 months. Identifying and treating women of reproductive age before they become pregnant preferable, but if DAAs are found to be safe and effective for use in pregnancy, they will also contribute to the prevention of MTCT.\n\n【233】 #Implementation considerations\n- Integration with HIV testing. WHO now recommends HIV testing for all pregnant women . The offer of HBV testing alongside existing HIV testing and PMTCT interventions is an effective and efficient mechanism of scaling up HBV testing for pregnant women and their partners. Information on risk factors for HCV infection should be communicated to pregnant women and, if present, or in high-endemic settings, testing for HCV should also be considered alongside testing for HIV and HBV.\n- Timing of testing. Testing should be done as early as possible during pregnancy to enable pregnant women to benefit most from prevention, treatment and care, and to reduce the risk of transmission to their infants. It can also be performed late in pregnancy, in labour or, if that is not feasible, as soon as possible after delivery.\n- Pre-and post-test counselling. Pre-test information for women who are or may become pregnant or who are postpartum should include: the benefits of early diagnosis of HBV or HCV infection for their own health, as well as to reduce the risk of HBV or HCV transmission to the infant; and importance of testing also for HIV and syphilis. Post-test counselling should include: use of antiviral therapy for the mother's health as appropriate; measures to reduce the risk of transmitting HBV or HCV infection to the infant; encouragement for partner testing; advice on childbirth plans and infant-feeding options with an encouragement to deliver in a health facility to ensure access to PMTCT services; and HBV and HCV testing for the infant.\nThere are significant gaps and missed opportunities for diagnosis and documenting the HBV and HCV status of children of HBV-positive parents or HCV-positive mothers.\n\n【234】 #Hepatitis B infection.\nIn endemic countries, HBV-infection is predominantly transmitted perinatally or in early childhood. In some settings, up to 50% of childhood infections may be attributable to horizontal intrafamilial transmission. In non-endemic settings, most children with CHB are migrants or children of migrants from endemic countries1 summarizes the existing WHO guidelines on HBV infection prevention in newborns. Although 70-90% of children who are exposed perinatally will become chronically infected, HBV-related morbidity is low during childhood as they are generally in the immune-tolerant phase. Since there are also low curative rates with both long-term NA and IFN treatment, and concerns over long-term safety and risk of drug resistance, a conservative approach to antiviral therapy is indicated, unless there are other criteria for treatment, such as cirrhosis or evidence of severe ongoing necroinflammatory disease . Tenofovir is approved for use in adolescents and children above the age of 12 years for HBV treatment (and 3 years or older for HIV treatment), and entecavir above 2 years of age.\n\n【235】 1. WHO recommendations on HBV prevention in newborns and children\nAll infants should receive their first dose of hepatitis B vaccine as soon as possible after birth, preferably within 24 hours, followed by two or three doses.\nHBIG prophylaxis, in conjunction with HBV vaccination, may be of additional benefit for the following: newborn infants whose mothers are HBsAg positive, particularly if they are also HBeAg positive. In full-term neonates born to mothers who are HBsAg positive but HBeAg negative, protection against perinatally acquired infection achieved by immediate vaccination against HBV (given within 24 hours) may not be significantly improved by the addition of HBIG. Hepatitis C infection. In countries where adults have a high prevalence of HCV infection, an increased prevalence in children is often observed. This rate is particularly high in those exposed to medical interventions and treated in hospitals . Children born to mothers with HCV infection, especially those who are HIV-coinfected, are also at risk , and MTCT is the most common cause of HCV infection in young children.\nAs with HBV infection, the progression of HCV liver disease is usually slow in infected children. None of the DAAs have yet been approved for use among children (data from ongoing clinical trials will provide the necessary safety and efficacy data for paediatric regulatory approval), and so the only approved treatment remains PEG-IFN/ribavirin. However, as DAAs offer the potential for curative treatment at an early stage before progression of liver disease in children, earlier HCV testing in infants and children will also become more important.\n\n【236】 #Implementation considerations\n- Service delivery approaches to delivering testing to infants and children2 shows potential testing approaches to improve hepatitis case-finding among infants and children - Prioritize testing children of all HBV-or HCV-positive mothers (especially if the mother is HCV/HIV-coinfected) through home-or facility-based testing.\n- Offer testing to all children and adolescents presenting with signs and symptoms that suggest acute viral hepatitis, including anorexia, nausea, jaundice, right upper quadrant discomfort and abnormal liver function tests.\n- Consider offering viral hepatitis testing to all children and adolescents attending HIV services, STI clinics and TB clinics.\n- Offer viral hepatitis testing or retesting to mothers or infants in immunization clinics or under-5 clinics.\n- Target HCV testing to children who have had medical interventions or received blood products in countries where screening of blood is not routine or where medical equipment is inadequately sterilized.\nIn high HBV-or HCV-prevalence settings, two groups of adolescents (defined as 10-19 years of age) are at potential risk of HBV or HCV infection and may need access to testing. These include the following:  undiagnosed adolescents who were HBV exposed perinatally or in early childhood in highly endemic HBV settings, and who missed out on HBV vaccination. These adolescents need to be diagnosed and started on antiviral treatment if and when this is clinically indicated, or if negative, vaccinated for HBV.  Adolescents who acquire HBV or HCV sexually or through injecting drug use through sex with multiple partners, or with MSM. It is important that these adolescents receive targeted interventions to increase access to HIV and hepatitis testing .\nThis includes setting targets, reviewing the effectiveness of existing testing activities and identifying gaps, and then adjusting programme activities.\n\n【237】 #Key points\n- There are many facility-and community-based opportunities for and approaches to delivering viral hepatitis testing .\nCountries need to consider a strategic mix of these testing approaches to reach different populations, identify people who are unaware that they are infected in the early stages of infection, and support the timely linkage to prevention, care and treatment services for those who test positive or negative.\n- The selection and mix of testing approaches and application of effective programming practices should be based on a situational assessment that includes: national context and epidemiology (prevalence, populations affected and undiagnosed burden); existing health-care and testing infrastructure; current testing uptake and coverage (number and proportion ever tested by population); programme costs and costeffectiveness of different testing approaches at national and subnational levels; available financial and human resources; and preferences of the populations to be served.\n- All available epidemiological data from surveillance, surveys and programmes should be used to guide geographical, population, facility and service prioritization.\n- Programmes should monitor data from testing services and in general favour the testing approaches that result in the highest proportion of positive diagnoses in priority populations.\nStep 1: Review national and subnational epidemiology\nIn order to devise successful testing services, it is important for countries to understand which populations and settings have the highest prevalence and incidence of HBV and HCV, the estimated number of people affected in the population, and where the greatest burden of undiagnosed infection exists geographically, and by age, sex and population group.\nAlthough it is difficult to know the exact number of people with chronic hepatitis B or C infection or the number of new infections in a given area, this can be estimated through the analysis of all available epidemiological data from multiple sources, including surveillance, surveys and programmes. As populationbased household surveys seldom reach or identify high-risk populations and marginalized vulnerable groups, additional studies may be required.\n1.\n\n【238】 #- Estimates of HBsAg and HCV antibody prevalence in the general and specific high-risk populations°\nAn estimate of HBsAg and HCV antibody prevalence in the general population stratified by place (if relevant and available) and age group (for general population to identify which ages are at highest risk), as well as in pregnant women attending ANC from national population-based household surveys and surveillance data among pregnant women;° For each high-risk population group identified with a higher prevalence:\n-the prevalence of chronic infection in that population group -an estimation of the proportion of the infected population that belongs to that population group -an estimation of the size of that population group.\nOnce the information on the prevalence has been summarized for the general population and specific groups, an analysis of the situation may guide the selection of groups to target with testing services. Testing population groups with a higher prevalence may have a higher yield but lead to the identification of a lower proportion of those living with infection.\nTesting the general population (or a defined age or birth cohort) may have a lower yield but leads to the identification of a larger proportion of those living with infection.\n- Hepatitis testing uptake, by different populations and testing approaches;\nand proportion of those tested who are positive, by population, testing approach or facility;\n- Number and proportion of people who are aware of their HBV and HCV status Depending on the data available, this may be the proportion of individuals who have ever been tested for HBV or HCV, or of people who were tested in the past 12 months and received their results. These data may be disaggregated by sex, age, geographical region, population type, testing approach and facility.\n- Proportion of people who tested positive and who have been enrolled in hepatitis care and treatment services.\nStep 2: Set testing (and treatment) coverage targets\nFor each type of testing service, a target may be set in terms of the number of persons to test and to refer for care and treatment or prevention if they are not infected but are at high ongoing risk. An additional target may include the proportion of persons living with viral hepatitis who are diagnosed. The consolidation of targets of all services considered will lead to an overall target for the number of persons for testing and treatment.\nCoordinating testing with treatment scale up. As the primary reason for diagnosing people with chronic hepatitis B and C is so that they can benefit from treatment, it is important to directly link testing and treatment targets. Plans for major scale up of treatment services will not succeed without testing. Similarly, major scale up of testing, which will create a demand for treatment, will have limited benefit without concurrently expanding treatment capacity.\nStep 3: Review the effectiveness of existing testing services and identify gaps\nFollowing an epidemiological analysis, an assessment and mapping of current hepatitis testing activities and coverage can determine how well existing services are covering populations in need1.\n- Mapping of existing services, including location of all current testing settings and sites, uptake and coverage rate (by sex, age and population), and funding source. This may include facility-based testing in ANC, TB, STI clinics as well as in harm reduction, outpatient and inpatient services; outreach testing for key populations, community-based and mobile testing, testing within the workplace or educational institutions; and testing by private health-care providers.\nStep 4: Assess costs and cost-effectiveness of different testing approaches\n- Assessing costs. Comparing the costs associated with a given testing approach between countries can be challenging. Costs for similar services often differ significantly between countries and by testing approach within a country, due to both general cost differences between countries and to differences in the specific services provided (e.g. referral to a clinic for those testing positive versus enhanced linkage support), cadre of staff employed (e.g. nurses versus community health workers), and the ease of reaching different populations. Direct cost comparisons of different testing approaches are easier to interpret when they use the same costing inputs. A common approach to estimating costs involves identifying costs incurred in the following broad categories: personnel (e.g. staff salaries and allowances); recurrent costs (e.g. test kits and commodities, printed materials, office supplies); and capital expenses, often totalled over their useful life and discounted annually at 3% (e.g. office space, vehicles, equipment). These costs can be added to compute the total expected cost of an intervention per year.\n- Estimating cost-effectiveness. Cost-effectiveness analyses compare the costs and health impacts of different interventions to identify those that provide good value for money, and are useful for optimizing the allocation of public health resources. Health outcomes used in cost-effectiveness analyses of hepatitis testing services include: number of people tested; number of hepatitis B or C cases identified; number of infections averted (when linked to vaccination and prevention of MTCT); number of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) lost or number of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained (dependent not only on being diagnosed but linked to treatment).\nThe health benefits associated with testing are not derived from the test itself, but rather from the treatment and prevention interventions that occur subsequently, including the effectiveness of linkage from testing to treatment. The cost of a programme and its relative cost-effectiveness also depends greatly on the specifics of the programme itself. For example, a programme designed to reach PWID by running mobile camps at various locations can have significantly different costs from providing testing in a fixed location, such as a drug treatment programme. Still, both testing approaches may be necessary to reach this key population Different approaches may be cost-effective for different populations.\nStep 5: Monitor, evaluate and adjust programme activities\nEnsuring that hepatitis testing programmes are reaching their intended populations and identifying previously undiagnosed positive persons will require continued monitoring and evaluation. For long-term success, the impact of different hepatitis testing approaches on uptake, the proportion that tests positive, costs, and changes in the prevalence of hepatitis B or C in different population groups must be evaluated and measured regularly, and programmes must be adjusted appropriately. Other activities include the following:\n- Revisit and revise national targets for and approaches to hepatitis testing so as to better reach those who are undiagnosed, taking into account linkage and enrolment in treatment.\n- Develop and follow a national consensus plan for expanding and refocusing hepatitis testing in line with the treatment plan.\n- Evaluate implemented programmes through routine programme monitoring, programme-specific evaluations, surveillance and population-based surveys.\n- Testing services also require their own monitoring and evaluation framework.\nIn 2016, WHO published a monitoring and evaluation framework for hepatitis B and C (Monitoring and evaluation for viral hepatitis B and C: recommended indicators and framework. Geneva: WHO, 2016) that proposes ten core indicators , and includes the proportion of persons living with HBV or HCV infection diagnosed.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does provide a basis for identifying adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates.\n\n【2】 ## Infusion Reactions\nPossible histamine-mediated symptoms have been reported with Mycamine, including rash, pruritus, facial swelling, and vasodilatation.\nInjection site reactions, including phlebitis and thrombophlebitis have been reported, at Mycamine doses of 50-150 mg/day. These reactions tended to occur more often in patients receiving Mycamine via peripheral intravenous administration.\n\n【3】 ## Clinical Trials Experience in Adults\nIn all clinical trials with Mycamine, 2497/2748 (91%) adult patients experienced at least one treatment-emergent adverse reaction.\nCandidemia and Other Candida InfectionsIn a randomized, double-blind study for treatment of candidemia and other Candida infections, treatment-emergent adverse reactions occurred in 183/200 (92%), 187/202 (93%) and 171/193 (89%) patients in the Mycamine 100 mg/day, Mycamine 150 mg/day, and caspofungin (a 70 mg loading dose followed by a 50 mg/day dose) treatment groups, respectively. Selected treatment-emergent adverse reactions, those occurring in 5% or more of the patients and more frequently in a Mycamine treatment group, are shown inTable 3.\nIn a second, supportive, randomized, double-blind study for treatment of candidemia and other Candidainfections, treatment-emergent adverse reactions occurred in 245/264 (93%) and 250/265 (94%) patients in the Mycamine (100 mg/day) and AmBisome (3 mg/kg/day) treatment groups, respectively. The following treatment-emergent adverse reactions in the Mycamine treated patients at least 16 years of age were notable: nausea (10% vs. 8%); diarrhea (11% vs. 11%), vomiting (13% vs. 9%), abnormal liver function tests (4% vs. 3%); increased aspartate aminotransferase (3% vs. 2%), and increased blood alkaline phosphatase (3% vs. 2%), in the Mycamine and AmBisome treatment groups, respectively.\nEsophageal Candidiasis\nProphylaxis of Candida Infections in Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Recipients\nA double-blind study was conducted in a total of 882 patients scheduled to undergo an autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant. The median duration of treatment was 18 days (range 1 to 51 days) in both treatment arms.\nAll adult patients who received Mycamine  or fluconazole  experienced at least one adverse reaction during the study. Treatment-emergent adverse reactions resulting in Mycamine discontinuation were reported in 15 (4%) adult patients; while those resulting in fluconazole discontinuation were reported in 32 (8%)\nOther selected adverse reactions reported at less than 5% in adult clinical trials are listed below:\n- Blood and lymphatic system disorders: coagulopathy, pancytopenia, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura - Cardiac disorders: cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, pericardial effusion\n- General disorders and administration site conditions: infusion reaction, injection site thrombosis - Hepatobiliary disorders: hepatocellular damage, hepatomegaly, jaundice, hepatic failure\n- Immune disorders: hypersensitivity, anaphylactic reaction\n- Nervous system disorders: convulsions, encephalopathy, intracranial hemorrhage\n- Psychiatric disorders: delirium\n- Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: urticaria\n\n【4】 ## Clinical Trials Experience in Pediatric Patients\nThe overall safety of Mycamine was assessed in 479 patients 3 days through 16 years of age who received at least one dose of Mycamine in 11 separate clinical studies. The mean treatment duration was 24.8 days. A total of 246 patients received at least one dose of Mycamine 2 mg/kg or higher.\nOf the 479 pediatric patients, 264 (55%) were male, 319 (67%) were Caucasians, with the following age distribution: 116 (24%) less than 2 years, 108 (23%) between 2 and 5 years, 140 (29%) between 6 years and 11 years, and 115 (24%) between 12 and 16 years of age.\nIn all pediatric studies with Mycamine, 439/479 (92%) patients experienced at least one treatment-emergent adverse reaction.\nTwo studies that included pediatric patients were randomized, double-blind, and active-controlled: The invasive candidiasis and candidemia study investigated the efficacy and safety of Mycamine (2 mg/kg/day for patients weighing 40 kg or less and 100 mg/day for patients weighing greater than 40 kg) compared to AmBisome (3 mg/kg/day) in 112 pediatric patients. Treatment-emergent adverse reactions occurred in 51/56 (91%) of patients in the Mycamine group and 52/56 (93%) of patients in the AmBisome group. Treatment-emergent adverse reactions resulting in Mycamine discontinuation were reported in 2 (4%) pediatric patients; while those resulting in AmBisome discontinuation were reported in 9 (16%).\nThe prophylaxis study in patients undergoing HSCT investigated the efficacy of Mycamine (1 mg/kg/day for patients weighing 50 kg or less and 50 mg/day for patients weighing greater than 50 kg) as compared to fluconazole (8 mg/kg/day for patients weighing 50 kg or less and 400 mg/day for patients weighing greater than 50 kg). All 91 pediatric patients experienced at least one treatment-emergent adverse reaction. Three (7%) pediatric patients discontinued Mycamine due to adverse reaction; while one (2%) patient discontinued fluconazole.\nOther clinically significant adverse reactions reported at less than 15% in pediatric clinical trials are listed below:\n- Hepatobiliary disorders: hyperbilirubinemia - Investigations: liver function tests abnormal\n- Renal Disorders: renal failure\n\n【5】 ## Postmarketing Adverse Reactions\nThe following adverse reactions have been identified during the post-approval use of micafungin sodium for injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency.\n- Blood and lymphatic system disorders: disseminated intravascular coagulation\n- Hepatobiliary disorders: hepatic disorder\n- Renal and urinary disorders: renal impairment\n- Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis - Vascular disorders: shock", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

This includes wound dressings, prevention of infection, correct positioning, pressure-area care and assessment for surgery\n\n【1】 #CONTENTS\n\n【2】 #INTRODUCTION\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) Nursing Guidelines are designed to provide the direction and guidance necessary to ensure that all hospital staff members delivering nursing care in ICRC-supported hospital projects meet professional standards for high-quality, evidence-based nursing care.\nThese guidelines are based on the latest research and current best practice in nursing care Much of the information is based on universally accepted guidelines established by the World Health Organization and other recognized health institutions. Owing to a lack of research data on nursing care in low-resource and conflict settings, the ICRC Nursing Guidelines are also based on the long experience of ICRC hospital and health specialists, both in the field and at headquarters, in Geneva.\nEvery ICRC-supported hospital project is different, and patients may have varying needs; however, the ICRC Nursing Guidelines are designed for use in all projects, keeping variations to a minimum and ensuring a standardized delivery of high-quality patient care across the board. This standardized approach has proven to be the most effective means of ensuring that all staff members, resident and mobile, can confidently deliver high-quality patient care.\nTo make the guidelines easy to use in a hospital setting, they are available both online and as a PDF. The additional resources can also be printed out if necessary.\n\n【3】 The guidelines will be reviewed within the next five years.\nICRC NURSING GUIDELINE 1 STANDARD PRECAUTIONS OVERVIEW Standard precautions are a set of practices designed to prevent the transmission of pathogens between patients and staff, thus preventing the spread of infection. Standard precautions should be followed:\n- by all health-care workers (doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, cleaners, etc.) - in all health-care facilities - by visitors and caretakers - for every patient, regardless of their diagnosis or presumed infectious status.\nStandard precautions protect staff and patients. They must be followed in the presence body fluids, including around blood, secretions, drainage, urine, faeces, vomit, mucus membranes and broken skin.\nThere are eight categories of standard precautions:\n- hand hygiene - use of personal protective equipment - handling and management of sharps - respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette - handling and management of linen - decontamination of patient-care items - environmental cleaning - waste management.\n\n【4】 #OBJECTIVE\nTo reduce the spread of infections between patients and staff. This will decrease the number of infections, decrease the length of patients' stays, decrease mortality, decrease costs and prevent staff illness.\n\n【5】 #HAND HYGIENE\nHand hygiene includes handwashing and using alcohol-based hand gel. In addition, nails must be kept short, nail polish is prohibited, and no jewellery -including watches -may be worn below the elbow.\n\n【6】 #Handwashing\nMany pathogens are spread by lack of handwashing. Washing your hands correctly removes those pathogens. Wash your hands on arriving at work, after using the bathroom, when moving from patient to patient and when your hands are dirty or visibly soiled with blood or body fluids.\nHands must be washed with soapy water for 40 to 60 seconds\n\n【7】 #Using hand gel\nUsing alcohol-based hand gel destroys pathogens on the hands. It is fast and does not require water. Hand gel can be used when your hands are not visibly contaminated and in between contact with patients. It must be done for 20 to 30 seconds\n\n【8】 #PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT\nPersonal protective equipment (PPE) is any equipment worn to minimize your exposure to hazards in the workplace that can cause serious injuries or illnesses. The type of PPE you should wear depends on the risks. PPE includes gloves, masks, goggles and gowns.\n\n【9】 #Gloves\nWear gloves:\n- when touching patients or when there is risk of contact with body fluids, blood or non-intact skin - when handling dressings or other items used on patients, laboratory tubes, or soiled linen or equipment - when you have an open wound or other skin condition - in between patients or when changing procedures Gloves should be removed as soon as a procedure is complete.\nPerform hand hygiene after glove removal.\nYou must still wash your hands even if you wear gloves. 1 pair of gloves = 1 procedure = 1 patient Types of gloves:\n- non-sterile gloves should be used for most procedures. They are single-use only.\n- Sterile gloves should be used for surgical procedures or invasive procedures. They are single-use only.\n- protective gloves should be used for cleaning, handling waste, etc. You may reuse your own protective gloves but no one else's.\n\n【10】 #Masks\nYour choice of mask will depend on the circumstances:\n- Surgical masks are worn by contagious patients or health-care workers. They prevent the wearer from spreading germs to those in the surrounding environment. They should always be worn by the surgical team in an operating theatre during surgery. they do not protect the wearer from airborne contaminants - n95 respirators cover the nose, mouth and chin. They protect the wearer from inhaling droplet-borne pathogens, e.g. pulmonary tuberculosis or severe acute respiratory syndrome. To be effective, the respirator must fit your face properly and have a tight seal.\n\n【11】 #Goggles\nGoggles protect the mucous membrane of the eyes during activities where there may be a splash of body fluid.\nEye visors and face shields protect the nose and mouth as well as the eyes.\nNB If blood is splashed into the eyes or mucus membranes, wash the area with soapy water or irrigate the eye with sterile saline or water. An incident form must be filled out .\n\n【12】 #Gowns\n- Single-use plastic aprons protect your clothing and skin during activities where there may be a splash of body fluids, e.g. while dressing a wound or emptying a drain.\n- Long-sleeved gowns should be worn during surgical procedures or if a patient is in isolation or immunocompromised.\n\n【13】 #HANDLING AND MANAGEMENT OF SHARPS 1\n\n【14】 In order to prevent needle-stick injuries, all staff members must take care when handling needles, scalpels or any other sharp instrument, when cleaning instruments and when disposing of sharps. The following rules must be followed at all times.\nRules on sharps:\n- Never recap needles.\n- Do not disconnect needles from syringes by hand.\n- Dispose of sharps immediately after use in an appropriate sharps container.\n- Ensure the sharps container is nearby when handling sharps.\n- If a needle-stick injury is sustained, ensure the ICRC guidelines on exposure to HIV and hepatitis B and C are followed and the injury is reported to the supervisor and staff health delegate. 1 An incident form must be filled out .\n\n【15】 #RESPIRATORY HYGIENE/COUGH ETIQUETTE\nRules on respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette:\n- Anyone with respiratory symptoms must cover their nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing with a tissue or mask. Dispose of the tissue/mask after use and perform hand hygiene.\n- If a patient is presumed to have an infectious cough, they must wear a surgical mask.\n- Any staff member with a respiratory illness must wear a surgical mask.\n- Staff and visitors must wear respirators around patients with active tuberculosis (TB) or multi-drug resistant TB\n- Spitting in the hospital is strictly prohibited.\n- Signs should be posted at the hospital and ward entrance reminding people to practice good cough etiquette\n\n【16】 #HANDLING AND MANAGEMENT OF LINEN\nLinen includes work uniforms, surgical linen, bed linen and patient garments. Linen should be handled, transported and processed appropriately in order to reduce risk of transmitting pathogens to staff and patients.\n\n【17】 #Rules on linen:\n- Clean linen must be handled with clean hands.\n- Linen cupboards must be kept clean, tidy and dust-free. Closed cabinets are preferable.\n- Mattresses must be cleaned with the appropriate disinfectant when soiled and after a patient is discharged. All mattress covers must be fully washable and intact.\n- Bed linen must be changed at least twice a week and when soiled or dirty.\n- Patients must not share linen.\n- If dirty linen is not taken directly to the laundry, it must be stored in a labelled container in a clean, well-ventilated room.\n- Perform hand hygiene after handling linen.\n\n【18】 #DECONTAMINATION OF PATIENT-CARE ITEMS\nAll medical equipment and devices used for patients must be decontaminated appropriately. Items must be cleaned, disinfected or sterilized depending on how they are used and the infection risk they pose, as reflected in their Spaulding classification .\nTypes of decontamination:\n- cleaning entails removing foreign material using water and detergent, e.g. washing cooking utensils with soapy water. Does not destroy pathogens.\n- Low-level disinfection entails immersing equipment in or wiping equipment/surfaces down with a disinfectant once. Eliminates most pathogens but not spores, viruses or some fungi.\n- Sterilization entails using an autoclave. Eliminates all pathogens, including spores.\n\n【19】 #ENVIRONMENTAL CLEANING\nThe entire hospital environment should be kept clean and tidy. Daily cleaning should occur in all clinical areas, and a deep clean should occur weekly. All surfaces must be wiped down and disinfected as per hospital policy. Each area should have a cleaning schedule, including the ward, recovery room and operating theatre.\nRules for environmental cleaning:\n- All spills must be cleaned up immediately.\n- No rubbish should be left on the floor.\n- All urinals and bed pans must be stored clean and dry in an appropriate area, such as a sluice.\n\n【20】 #WASTE MANAGEMENT\nIt is the responsibility of all staff members to ensure that an adequate number of waste bins is available and that all waste is disposed of correctly.\nWaste type and management:\n- clinical waste is waste that is contaminated with body fluids (including blood), human tissues or lab waste, such as wound dressings, infusion sets, catheter bags and any material soaked in body fluids.\nClinical waste should be disposed of in the clinical-waste rubbish bag. (The rubbish bag may be yellow, orange or red, depending on supply.)\n- non-clinical waste is waste that is not contaminated, such as food, paper and boxes. Non-clinical waste can be put in the normal waste bin.\n\n【21】 #GENERAL WOUND CARE OVERVIEW\nA wound is any damage to or break in the surface of the skin caused by injury to the tissue. Wounds can be either chronic or acute chronic wounds are wounds that are slow to heal, such as a leg ulcer.\nacute wounds are wounds that go through the normal healing process, such as a laceration. They are usually caused by trauma or surgery.\nWound healing can occur by primary, secondary or tertiary intention.\n\n【22】 #Primary intention\nWound edges are brought together neatly with skin adhesive or sutures/staples.\nHealing usually occurs within days.\n\n【23】 #Secondary intention\n\n【24】 Exudate may be heavy.\nHealing can take a long time.\nDebridement may be needed.\n\n【25】 #Tertiary intention\nWound is left open and closed later, ideally within a few days (also known as \"delayed primary closure\").\nThere are four stages of healing:\n- haemostasis (occurs within minutes)\n- inflammatory phase (occurs within one to five days)\n- maturation phase (occurs from 21 days onwards).\n\n【26】 #OBJECTIVE\nTo ensure the nurse can confidently provide optimum wound care. Optimum wound care:\n- promotes healing - protects wounds from further contamination, injury and infection - promotes haemostasis.\nASSESSMENT When looking at a wound, you should assess the following:\n- depth of wound, i.e. superficial or deep - type of wound, i.e. surgical, traumatic or chronic - location of wound\n- involvement of other vital organs, nerves or blood vessels - signs of infection, e.g. redness, swelling, heat, odour or purulent exudate.\n\n【27】 #Factors that affect wound healing\nThe patient's condition\n- Weak immune status (HIV-positive or otherwise immunocompromised)\n- Advanced age - Poor nutritional status - Anaemia - Medications (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, steroids, anti-coagulants)\n- Pain\n- Stress - Other disease\n- Clean or not\n- Excessive exudate - Slough and necrotic tissue - Site/location of the wound - Blood supply to the area - Wound temperature (should be kept constant, not too cold or too hot)\n\n【28】 For vinegar dressings see Guideline 4\n\n【29】 #SUGAR DRESSINGS OVERVIEW\nSugar is a cheap, readily available and accessible dressing material that has been proven to act as an antimicrobial agent. Several clinical studies have found sugar to:\n- enable desloughing - assist in the formation of granulation tissue and early epithelialization - inhibit bacterial growth - accelerate wound healing\nSugar dressings are most effective on sloughy and infected wounds.\n\n【30】 #OBJECTIVE\nTo ensure the nurse can confidently apply a sugar dressing in order to promote wound healing.\n\n【31】 #Applying a sugar dressing\nUse a sugar dressing:\n- for open wounds with a cavity - on prescription by the surgeon.\n\n【32】 #DRESSING PROCEDURE\n1. Prepare the patient, set up the dressing trolley, perform hand hygiene and put on gloves as per steps 1 to 12 of the dressing procedure in Guideline 2, on wound care.\n2. Remove the old dressing.\n3. Remove gloves, perform hand hygiene and put on new gloves.\n4. Clean the wound thoroughly with saline to remove all sugar from the previous dressing, using non-touch technique.\n5. Irrigate the wound thoroughly with saline (using an irrigation syringe) until it is clean.\n6. Dry the wound with sterile compresses.\n7. Clean the surrounding skin with saline.\n8. Fill the cavity with sugar, using a sterile gauze packet as a funnel to pour the sugar into the wound. Distribute the sugar evenly.\n9. Cover the wound with fluffy, sterile gauze and secure the gauze with a dry dressing and crepe bandage as per Guideline 2.\n10. Clear and clean the trolley area as per Guideline 2.\n11. Remove your gloves and perform hand hygiene.\n12. Document the dressing change and the condition of the wound in the patient notes.\n\n【33】 #Frequency\nSugar dressings should be applied daily, unless otherwise stated by the surgeon.\n\n【34】 #Side effects\nSugar dressings can cause:\n- itching of the surrounding skin - excessive exudate.\nICRC NURSING GUIDELINE 4\n\n【35】 #VINEGAR DRESSINGS OVERVIEW\nPseudomonas aeruginosa (henceforth \"pseudomonas\") is a gram-negative bacterium that is resistant to many antibiotics. When a wound is infected with pseudomonas, it is difficult to treat. Acetic acid (in the form of diluted vinegar) has been proven to kill and inhibit the growth of pseudomonas by increasing the acidity in the wound\nOBJECTIVE PROCEDURE 9.\nRemove the vinegar compress.\n10. Rinse wound with saline and dry with a sterile compress.\n11. Dress the wound with dry, fluffy, sterile gauze and cover with a crepe bandage as per Guideline 2.\n12. Clear and clean the trolley as per Guideline 2.\n13. Perform hand hygiene.\n14. Document the dressing change and the condition of the wound in the patient notes.\n\n【36】 #Frequency\n- The dressing procedure should be carried out one to two times per day for seven to ten days.\n- Vinegar dressings should not be continued past ten days.\n- After ten days, assess the wound with the surgeon.\n\n【37】 #Side effects\nVinegar dressings can cause:\n- pain - a burning sensation - localized skin reactions.\n\n【38】 #SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS\nDo not use acetic vinegar with other antiseptic solutions.\n\n【39】 #ICRC NURSING GUIDELINE 5 CARING FOR A PATIENT WITH AN EXTERNAL FIXATOR OVERVIEW\n- External fixation (\"ex-fix\") is a procedure for setting and stabilizing broken bones whereby sterile pins are inserted into a fractured bone through surgical incisions in the skin The pins are held in place by an external clamp or frame.\n- The pins are used to assist with wound management in an open fracture, when there is considerable soft-tissue injury and/or bone loss.\n- When other methods of fracture alignment have failed or are unavailable, ex-fix can be used to keep the fracture aligned and in position in order to promote healing.\n- Multiple pins are needed to stabilize a fracture, and the pin sites need to be well managed, observed frequently and dressed regularly.\n\n【40】 #OBJECTIVE\nTo ensure the nurse is capable of providing high-quality care to promote fracture and wound healing and prevent infection of the bone and tissue around pins.\n\n【41】 #MANAGEMENT\n- The patient will have an external fixator applied during surgery; the surgeon will apply a dry dressing to all pin sites and the wound.\n- for independent pin sites: the dressing at the pin sites should be changed three days after surgery.\n\n【42】 #PROCEDURE FOR DRESSING PIN SITES\n1. Prepare the patient, set up the dressing trolley, perform hand hygiene and put on gloves as per steps 1 to 12 of the dressing procedure in Guideline 2, on wound care.\n2. Remove the old dressings from the pin sites.\n3. Wash your hands and put on new gloves.\n4. Gently move the skin around the pin site with sterile gauze to ensure the skin is free to move and any trapped exudate can move to the surface. This also prevents the skin from closing around the pin.\n5. If there is a collection of fluid with crusts, remove the crusts gently with sterile forceps.\n6. With new sterile gauze, clean the skin around the pins with saline, using a circular motion and moving from clean to dirty areas. Clean one pin at a time, with one piece of gauze for each pin.\n7. Dry each site with sterile gauze.\n8. Dress the pin site with dry sterile gauze. Secure the gauze with tape.\n\n【43】 #PROCEDURE FOR DRESSING PIN SITES\n9. Clean up the dressing trolley and dispose of waste as per Guideline 2.\n10. Perform hand hygiene.\n11. Document in the patient notes the change of dressing and the condition of the pin site.\n\n【44】 #Frequency\n- Apply a new dressing every Monday, Wednesday and Friday.\n- At least once a week or as required, the ex-fix frame should be cleaned thoroughly with warm soapy water (if available) or saline and then dried.\n\n【45】 #SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS\n- The patient can shower or wash ten days after surgery; the pin sites must be dressed immediately after they shower/wash.\n- In collaboration with the physiotherapist, ensure the patient moves independently as much as possible, using the appropriate mobility devices (e.g. crutches or a wheelchair).\n- Involve the physiotherapist to maximize the patient's limb function.\n- Do not dress pin sites with povidone-iodine, gels, ointments or occlusive dressings as these can obscure the colour and nature of the skin and/or prevent drainage from the pin sites.\n\n【46】 #MANAGING AN INFECTION\nfirst, notify the head nurse or surgeon.\nThen assess what stage the infection is at and treat it accordingly.\n\n【47】 #Infection stages\n- Stage 1: The pin site and/or surrounding area is red.\n- Stage 2: The pin site has serous or seropurulent exudate and localized cellulitis (redness, swelling, tender or warm to the touch). A superficial infection.\n- Stage 3: There is a deep infection, with or without loosening of the pin.\n\n【48】 #Treatment\n- Stage 1: Dress the pin sites daily -mobilize the skin around the pins, clean with saline and apply a dry dressing.\n- Stage 2: Treat the infection with an oral antibiotic according to the doctor's prescription If swab culture is possible, take a swab and await the results before treating with an antibiotic. Dress the pin sites daily -mobilize the skin around the pins, clean with saline and apply a dry dressing.\nNB Povidone-iodine is no longer used to clean or dress pin sites.  Any surgical team working in an ICRC-supported hospital project that wishes to apply a VAC dressing must have prior approval from the chief surgeon and hospital team in Geneva. This is a technique that requires a high level of nursing skill, the use of ICRC-approved material only and an excellent standard of hygiene. If these conditions are not met, the outcome for patients can be disastrous.\n\n【49】 #OBJECTIVES\nTo ensure the nurse is capable of providing high-quality nursing care to a patient with a VAC dressing.\nApplying negative pressure to the wound bed using a VAC pump:\n- removes excess exudate, promoting a moist healing environment - reduces swelling in the surrounding tissues - promotes granulation of tissues - reduces the number of bacteria in the wound - increases blood flow to the wound bed.\n\n【50】 #ASSESSMENT\nIndications for the use of a VAC dressing - Surgical debridement will be performed.\n- The VAC dressing will be applied in surgery by the surgeon or nurse.\nNursing care on the ward\n- Change the dressing every four to seven days, depending on the wound, the amount of fluid aspirated and the surgeon's orders\n- Wounds with a large amount of exudate or odour may require more frequent dressing changes.\n- Suction pressure is 125 mm Hg unless otherwise specified. The precise suction pressure to be used, and whether it is to be constant or intermittent, will depend on the wound's characteristics.\n- If there is a loss of suction, increase in pain or increase in odour, the pressure may need to be decreased or the dressing changed. Inform the surgeon before taking remedial action.\n- Always ensure the tubing is not blocked and the VAC is draining.\nObserve the patient for the following:\n- excessive pain and tenderness near the wound - elevated temperature - tachycardia - offensive smell from the wound - excessive wound discharge - bleeding from the wound.\n\n【51】 #Preparation\n- Check the patient file and ensure a dressing change is due.\n- Give analgesia 20 to 30 minutes prior to the change, if required.\n- Explain the procedure to the patient and get their consent.\n- Gather all the equipment required and set up the dressing trolley. (The trolley must be cleaned prior to use.)\n- Turn off suction 15 minutes prior to the dressing change. Clamp the tubing just before changing the dressing.\n\n【52】 #Equipment\n- 2. Don the required personal protective equipment.\n3. Ensure the dressing trolley is set up.\n4. Place a clean, absorbent pad under the affected body part.\n5. Rub hands with alcohol-based hand gel and put on non-sterile gloves.\n6. Remove soiled dressing and discard in the clinical-waste bag.\n7. Ensure all of the VAC sponge is removed.\n8. Assess the wound for healing, granulation, infection, amount of exudate, peri-wound area, etc. Report any concerns to the surgeon.\n9. Remove gloves.\n11. Open the dressing set and add all the necessary VAC and dressing material.\n12. Put on sterile gloves and cut the VAC sponge to shape using sterile scissors.\n13. Clean the wound and peri-wound area with aseptic/non-touch technique as per Guideline 2 (on wound care).\n14. To dress the wound, follow either A or B below, according to the VAC system.\n15. After dressing the wound, dispose of all waste and clean the trolley and surrounding area.\n16. Perform hand hygiene, washing your hands with soap and water.\n17. Document the process in the patient notes.\n\n【53】 #A. PROCEDURE FOR A TRANSPORTABLE, BATTERY-RUN VAC SYSTEM\n1. Fill the wound cavity with the pre-cut sponge but do not pack it tightly: the sponge should extend slightly above the level of the surrounding skin. Once the suction is applied, the sponge should not be on healthy skin.\n2. Cut the transparent adhesive dressing to size, apply it over the sponge and ensure it is well sealed.\n3. Remove your gloves and place them in the clinical-waste bag.\n4. Rub your hands with alcohol-based hand gel.\n5. Cut a small hole in the adhesive dressing, over the sponge.\n6. Place the adhesive pad and tubing directly over the cut hole. 8. Turn on the vacuum device, set it to the prescribed pressure and confirm that the dressing and sponge shrink down correctly. The sponge should collapse down and become firm. If this does not occur, look for any leaks and cover with more adhesive dressing.\n\n【54】 #B. PROCEDURE FOR A WALL SUCTION VAC SYSTEM\n1. Fill the wound cavity with the pre-cut sponge but do not pack it tightly: the sponge should extend slightly above the level of the surrounding skin. Once the suction is applied, the sponge should not be on healthy skin.\n2. Cut the VAC tubing to size -the hole needs to be in place over the sponge.\n3. Cover with another piece of sponge.\n4. Cut the transparent adhesive dressing to cover the top sponge. Allow for at least a 3-5 cm border around the sponge.\n5. Apply the adhesive dressing over the sponge and ensure it is well sealed.\n6. Remove your gloves and place them in the clinical-waste bag.\n7. Rub your hands with alcohol-based hand gel.\n8. Attach the VAC tubing to the Y-connector.\n9. Attach the tubing to the collection bottle and ensure the tube is connected to the wall suction outlet.\n10. Turn on the wall suction system and set the pressure to the prescribed level.\n11. The sponge should collapse down and become firm. If this does not occur, look for any leaks and cover with more adhesive dressing.\n\n【55】 #Documentation\nDocument the dressing change in the patient notes, including:\n- the time and date of the dressing change - the date for the next dressing change - a description of wound, peri-wound, size, odour, exudate - the suction pressure - the number of sponge pieces in the wound - pain management pre-and post-dressing change, plus the patient's pain score - any changes to the treatment plan.\nICRC NURSING GUIDELINE 7\n\n【56】 #CARING FOR A PATIENT WITH A SPLIT SKIN GRAFT OVERVIEW\nA split skin graft is a surgical procedure whereby part of the skin (epidermis or dermis) is taken from one area of the body (the donor site) and transplanted to another part of the body to cover a wound (the recipient site).\n\n【57】 #OBJECTIVE\nTo ensure the nurse is capable of providing high-quality care to patients with split skin grafts.\n\n【58】 #INDICATIONS\nSplit skin grafts are used:\n- to cover extensive wounds that cannot be directly closed with sutures - to cover deep or extensive burns - to cover wounds that are likely to result in functional restrictions owing to excessive scarring.\n\n【59】 #The recipient site\nIn order for the graft to take (i.e. to integrate and heal into the wound) the recipient site needs to:\n- be clean and free from slough or other necrotic tissue - be free of infection - have a good blood supply - show signs of granulation\n\n【60】 #The donor site\nIntact healthy skin can be taken from the thigh, buttock, back, upper arm or scalp (in paediatrics).\n\n【61】 #Preoperative\n- The day before surgery, the donor site should be selected by the surgeon and marked.\ni.e. it meets the criteria above.\n- If the donor site is hairy, hair removal may be required -check with the surgeon.\n- The night before surgery, wash the donor site with soap and water, dry it and cover it with a sterile dry dressing, indicating the donor site on a piece of tape secured to the dressing.\n\n【62】 #Care of graft (recipient site)\n- After surgery the graft dressing should be left intact for five days.\n- The first dressing change should be done by the surgeon after five days. If the wound is large, the patient should be taken back to the operating theatre.\n- After ten days post-operation, the sutures or staples can be removed as per the surgeon's request.\n\n【63】 #PROCEDURE FOR DRESSING A GRAFT\n1. Prepare the patient, set up the dressing trolley, perform hand hygiene and put on gloves as per steps 1 to 12 of the dressing procedure in Guideline 2, on wound care. Analgesia must be provided.\nRemove the old dressing with two pairs of sterile forceps, using one pair to gently support the graft in place and the other pair to gently loosen the dressing. Saline may be required to moisten the dressing if it is sticking to the graft.\n3. Remove gloves, perform hand hygiene again and put on new gloves.\n4. Clean the surrounding skin gently with saline, using aseptic technique, and dry.\nCover the graft with one layer of paraffin gauze (e.g. Jelonet) and apply sterile gauze and a crepe bandage.\n6. Dispose of waste in the clinical-waste bag and clean the trolley with ICRC-approved disinfectant.\n7. Perform hand hygiene.\n\n【64】 #Care of donor site\n- After surgery the donor site should be left intact for ten days.\n- The first dressing change should be done after ten days.\n\n【65】 #SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS\n\n【66】 - If there are any signs of infection or that the graft is not healing, inform the surgeon.\n- If an upper limb has been grafted, it should be elevated for at least five days to decrease swelling.\n\n【67】 #ICRC NURSING GUIDELINE 8 CARING FOR A PATIENT WITH A PRESSURE INJURY OVERVIEW\nA pressure injury (previously called a \"pressure sore\" or \"pressure ulcer\") is a localized area of damage to the skin and/or underlying tissue, usually over a bony prominence. It results from pressure or pressure and shear combined. When the skin is compressed against a surface or force, blood flow to that area is decreased and cell damage can develop. The skin can then break down, causing a blister, wound or cavity.\n\n【68】 #OBJECTIVE\nTo ensure the nurse is capable of providing high-quality care to patients in order to prevent the development of pressure injuries, identify the stages of a pressure injury and manage them appropriately.\n\n【69】 #Risk factors\n- Impaired mobility (owing to paralysis, fractures, bed rest, etc.)\n- Increased moisture (sweat, urine, etc.)\n- Shear/friction - Medical equipment causing pressure areas (cervical collars, oxygen masks, casts, splints, etc.)\n- Items in pockets causing pressure areas (keys, mobile phones, etc.)\n- -Full-thickness tissue loss where the base is covered by slough (green, grey, yellow or brown) and/or eschar (tan, brown or black) -Until slough/eschar is removed, the true depth and stage of the injury cannot be identified\n\n【70】 #Suspected deep tissue injury (depth unknown)\n-Localized purple or maroon colour or other discolouration -Intact skin or blood-filled blister due to damage of underlying soft tissue\n\n【71】 #Assessing the skin\nObserve the skin for:\n- persistent erythema - non-blanching erythema - blisters - localized heat or swelling - localized induration - for patients with dark skin, localized heat where tissue becomes cool if damaged.\nA patient's skin should be assessed for signs of pressure injury at the following times:\n- on admission - daily - during dressing changes - when the patient is turned/rolled.\nInspect skin around medical devices, including around:\n- oxygen masks - intravenous tubing - nasogastric tubing\n- urinary catheters - drains - splints/plaster of Paris.\n\n【72】 #Prevention\n- Identify patients at a high risk of developing pressure injuries.\n- Involve the physiotherapist. Nurses and physiotherapists are both responsible for preventing pressure injuries.\n- Ensuring patients are turned regularly is an essential part of the patient's nursing care: If a patient is on bed rest and immobile, regular pressure-area care must be done, and the patient must be turned/rolled every two hours. This should be done by at least two nurses, and the patient must not be dragged in bed.\nAll staff members providing nursing care should be fully trained in turning and moving patients.\n- Use pressure-relieving devices where possible (foam mattress overlays or pillows, cushions, heel protectors, etc.).\n- Teach the patient how to relieve pressure using lifts or other pressure-relieving manoeuvres, as appropriate.\n- Avoid positioning the patient on bony parts of their body.\n- Where available, use manual handling aids to reduce friction and shear, such as slide sheets.\n- Avoid putting the patient in lying positions that increase pressure, such as the 90-degree side-lying position - Ensure heels are suspended off the bed; use heel elevators where possible.\n- Promote early mobilization and activity as tolerated.\n- Inspect the skin regularly during each turning manoeuvre.\n- Maintain a stable skin temperature. Use a fan or other cooling device if necessary.\n- Prevent the skin from becoming damp: ensure the bed and linen are kept clean, dry and wrinkle-free.\n- Keep skin clean and dry.\n- Address any nutritional deficiencies and keep the patient on a healthy diet.\n- Monitor the patient's weight\n\n【73】 #Treatment\nTreatment will depend on the stage of the pressure injury and the characteristics of the wound. The choice of dressing will need to be discussed by the surgical team and will also depend on what products are available.\nAll stages of a pressure injury require pressure-area care and, if available, a skin-barrier product (to protect the surrounding skin).\n\n【74】 #SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS\n- Address the underlying cause of pressure injuries.\n- Never rub or massage a reddened area or pressure injury.\n- Prevention is much better for the patient than treatment.\n- If any signs of a possible pressure injury appear, report this immediately to the head nurse and document it in the patient notes.\n\n【75】 #ICRC NURSING GUIDELINE 9 CARING FOR A PATIENT WITH BURNS OVERVIEW\nA burn is an injury to the skin caused by exposure to heat, electricity, chemicals or radiation. Managing burns requires access to extensive resources, which can be challenging in a low-resource setting.\nSevere burns involve one or more of the following and require hospitalization:\n- burns over more than 10% of total body surface area (TBSA) for children and more than 15% of TBSA for adults\n\n【76】 Minor burns are burns that affect less than 10% of TBSA in children and 15% in adults, with no other risk factors A burn injury can be caused by various mechanisms, such as:\n- flames - scalding - contact with hot objects or surfaces\n- electrical shock - inhalation - radiation - chemicals - friction - frost\n\n【77】 #OBJECTIVE\nTo ensure the nurse is capable of providing high-quality care to patients with burns.\n\n【78】 #ASSESSMENT\nWhen a patient arrives in the ward with a burn, first do a primary survey, followed by a thorough assessment of the burn\n\n【79】 #Primary survey\nIn your primary survey, assess the following, starting with A (airway) and ending with F (fluid resuscitation):\n- airway with cervical spine immobilization - breathing - circulation and bleeding control\n- disability - Exposure, environmental control, assessment of burns and other injuries - fluid resuscitation\n\n【80】 #Assessing a burn\nOnce you have completed A through D, move to E, which includes burn assessment. To assess a burn, you must consider the circumstances, time and severity of the burn.\n\n【81】 #Circumstances\nAsk the patient or a witness:\n- how the burn was sustained - whether they have any other injuries (risk of spinal injury, fractures)\n- whether there was a lot of smoke - whether the patient lost consciousness - whether first aid was provided at the time of the burn and, if so, what first aid.\n\n【82】 #Time\nAscertain when the burn occurred, i.e. the date and time.\n\n【83】 #Severity\nBurn severity should be assed in terms of:\n- size - depth - site - inhalation injury - other injuries.\nSize: The size of the burn is estimated as a percentage of TBSA. There are two main methods for determining burn size:\n1. Rule of palm -This can be used as a rapid assessment.\n-Use the size of the victim's palm to represent 1% of TBSA. Site: The severity, risks and treatment of a burn injury depend on where the burn is situated on the body.\n- Circumferential burns -these are burns that span the entire circumference of a limb, the chest or the abdomen. They can be deep and are very dangerous owing to the subsequent swelling.\nThey usually require escharotomy (incision through the burned tissue to relieve compression).\n- Hand burns -these require urgent treatment. The hand can become swollen quickly, which can result in stiffness and contractures.\n- Chest burns -full-thickness chest burns can cause difficulty breathing and may require escharotomy.\n- Facial and neck burns -these can result in airway problems.\n\n【84】 #Examination for other injuries\nIn step E of your primary survey, also examine the patient for other injuries, including:\n- spinal injury - airway obstruction - head injury - inadequate ventilation - circulatory collapse.\n\n【85】 #Secondary survey\nOnce the patient is stabilized and the burn is dressed, carry out the secondary survey\n\n【86】 #First-aid treatment\nIf patient arrives at the hospital without previous first aid, drench the burn in cold water and remove burned clothes If the burn is small, immerse it in or run it under cold water for 20 to 30 minutes.\n\n【87】 #On admission\nIn order to assess a patient's burns, you must:\n- expose the patient completely to examine all areas.\n- remove all clothing and jewellery.\n- keep the patient warm.\n- inspect the patient's front and back. If a cervical-spine injury is suspected, log-roll the patient to inspect their back.\n- cover the patient with a clean sheet.\n\n【88】 #Fluid resuscitation\n- If a burn covers over 10% of TBSA in a child or over 15% of TBSA in an adult, fluid resuscitation is required - You will need to know the percentage of TBSA burned, the patient's weight and the time of injury.\n- The most commonly used formula to calculate the fluid needed in the first 24 hours after injury is the Parkland formula.\n- Traditionally, the Parkland formula defines the volume of fluid to be given (in ml) as 4 x weight (kg) x % TBSA burned; however, this tends to over-resuscitate and guidelines now modify the formula depending on the patient and type of burn.\nParkland formula Volume (ml) = 2 x weight (kg) x % TBSA burned Give 50% of this volume in the first eight hours after injury, and give the remaining 50% over the following\n\n【89】 #hours\nType of fluid: Give crystalloid fluid -preferably either Ringer's lactate or Hartmann's solution. Normal saline can be used if nothing else is available.\nMaintenance fluid: Fluid requirements after the first 24 hours will be guided by urine output.\n\n【90】 #ADEQUATE URINE OUTPUT\nAdults Children 0.5-1 ml/kg/hr 1-2 ml/kg/hr\nChildren also require a maintenance fluid like dextrose saline.\n\n【91】 #Investigations\nThe following investigations should be carried out on admission:\n- haemoglobin count - electrolyte levels - glucose level - if there is a history of trauma, possibly a chest and pelvis X-ray - assessment of the patient's tetanus immunization status -if no cover, give a tetanus booster, and for patients at a high risk also give tetanus immunoglobulin.\n\n【92】 #Monitoring a patient with severe burns\nOn admission and during the first 24 hours, patients should be monitored hourly in a high-dependency unit (HDU) if possible. Once the patient is stabilized, monitoring can be reduced to every four hours. The patient should remain in the HDU for at least the first 24 hours.\nThe following must be monitored:\n\n【93】 #Analgesia\nMajor burns can be very painful and cause the patient a lot of anxiety and distress. Analgesia must be a priority. Analgesia should always be given prior to a dressing change.\nThe anaesthetist will prescribe the analgesia for the patient, but keep in mind the following.\n\n【94】 #- minor burns\nParacetamol, and sometimes tramadol, should be sufficient.\n\n【95】 #- moderate pain\nGive oral paracetamol and oral tramadol.\n- moderate to severe pain Oral paracetamol and morphine are required. Note: in the first 48 hours after a burn, oral drugs are not properly absorbed in the digestive tract, so either intravenous or subcutaneous morphine should be used.\n-morphine 0.2-0.5 ml/kg for adults and children. For children between three months and one year, half the dose.\nFor children under three months, quarter the dose.\nA doctor will need to be present when morphine is given.\n\n【96】 #Surgery\n- If the patient has circumferential burns, they may need escharotomy. The surgeon should perform this in the operating theatre within eight hours of injury.\n- Some burns will require surgery to scrub and debride the dead tissue and to accurately assess the extent of burn\n- Skin grafts may be needed for full-thickness burns.\n- If the airway is compromised by a burn or inhalation injury, a tracheostomy may be needed.\n\n【97】 #Nutrition\n- Good nutrition is critical to wound healing. For patients with severe burns, a normal diet is insufficient, and enteral feeds are preferred. Enteral feeding is also required if the patient is unable to eat.\nThis should be started on admission, the earlier the better.\n- Burns patients require high-protein, high-calorie diets with frequent, smaller meals throughout the day.\nThe diet should include therapeutic milk, plumpy nut, meat, pulses and egg mixes.\n- Patients will also require multivitamins.\n- Patients must be weighed weekly.\n- Give analgesia 30 minutes prior to a dressing change.\n- Wounds should be thoroughly cleansed.\n- Dressings should be thick and firm but not too tight.\n- Elevate limbs to prevent oedema.\nHowever, dressings on infected burn wounds and wounds that are highly productive should be changed daily.\n- The first dressing should be done in the operating theatre as should subsequent dressings if very painful.\n\n【98】 #PROCEDURE FOR DRESSING BURN WOUNDS\n1. Prepare the patient, set up the dressing trolley, perform hand hygiene and put on gloves as per steps 1 to 12 of the dressing procedure in Guideline 2, on wound care.\n2. Remove the previous dressing.\n3. Remove your gloves, use hand gel and put on new gloves.\n4. Loose tissue and blisters can be debrided with sterile forceps.\n\n【99】 #PROCEDURE FOR DRESSING BURN WOUNDS\n5. Clean the burn with povidone-iodine (PVI) scrub solution (one part 7.5% PVI to four parts 0.9% saline). If the burn is heavily contaminated, a deep and more vigorous cleaning will be needed. If it is too painful for the patient, this should be carried out in the operating theatre under anaesthesia/sedation. For superficial, less contaminated burns, gentle wiping is sufficient.\n6. Rinse the burn with 0.9% saline.\n7. Dry the skin with sterile gauze. Do not rub the skin; dry it by patting gently.\n8. Remove your gloves, use hand gel and put on sterile gloves.\n9. Apply silver sulfadiazine 1% with your gloved hand. Apply it generously to the entire burned area, about 3-5 mm thick. Do not apply it to the mouth or eyelids.\n11. Cover the wound with Jelonet or another paraffin gauze. Do not use a circular dressing.\n12. Cover the gauze with a sterile compress unfolded into a single layer.\n13. If there are large amounts exudate, apply absorbent pads of wool.\n14. Wrap with a crepe bandage, firmly but not tightly.\n15. Elevate the extremities and immobilize them in collaboration with the physiotherapist.\nNB Chlorhexidine can be used to clean burn wounds if it is available.\n\n【100】 #Minor burns\nDressing can be done on an outpatient basis. Use silver sulfadiazine or petroleum gauze, depending on the burn. If the burn is small, superficial and seen early (with no signs of infection) it can be cleaned with saline or soapy water.\n\n【101】 #Facial or perineal burns\nDressings to these areas are difficult to apply and hard to make stick. In these cases, the exposure method can be used: Clean the burn with saline and then cover it with a topical ointment such as paraffin. The aim is for a dry eschar to form. This technique is not to be used for other burns.\n\n【102】 #Eye burns\nIrrigate the eye with sterile water for one hour. Refer the patient to an eye specialist if available.\nNote: The open technique (exposure method) whereby a patient is left naked under a mosquito net or receives water-immersion therapy (bath) is no longer used.  \"Links\", below.\n\n【103】 #Physiotherapy and positioning\n- The physiotherapist should be involved in burn-patient care from the outset.\n- Correct positioning of the burned area and the patient must be ensured to prevent oedema, stiffness and contractures. This is the key role of the physiotherapist.\n- Pillows and towels can be used to keep limbs in alignment.\nOther aspects of nursing care\n- Ensure vital signs are taken regularly.\n- Strictly maintain the patient's fluid-balance chart.\n- Carry out regular pressure-area care (every two hours).\n- Keep the patient sitting upright to help with breathing if necessary. Support the patient with pillows.\n- Prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended but may be necessary in the presence of a wound infection.\n- Patients must be nursed in a clean area of the ward. If a single room is available this is preferred to ensure proper temperature and scrupulous hygiene. Ensure that there are fly screens on any open windows as well as mosquito nets.\n- Monitor the patient's mental health to observe for signs of depression, post-traumatic stress or other mental-health issues concerned with altered appearance, body image and acceptance. Always refer severely burned patients to the mental-health and psychosocial support team for mental-health support.\n- Enlist the support of relatives and other carers to ensure optimal recovery from burns.\n- Remind the patient and attendant that paraffin gauze is flammable and the patient should not smoke or get near an open flame.\n\n【104】 #SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS\nSevere burns should be referred to a specialized burn centre, where available. - Adequate debridement is performed (adequate surgical excision).\n- The wound remains open under a secure dressing, which is left undisturbed.\n- Delayed wound closure is performed (delayed primary closure).\nSurgical management according to these three principles has been proven to be safe and effective. It prevents complications such as infection and permits early wound closure -and thus a quicker recovery. It also reduces the number of dressing changes required, which makes nursing care easier and avoids unnecessary, painful procedures for the patient\n\n【105】 #OBJECTIVE\nTo ensure the nurse is capable of providing high-quality care to a patient with weapon wounds.\n\n【106】 #ASSESSMENT  DESCRIPTION\nThe surgeon and anaesthetist will assess the patient's condition and the wound(s) on their arrival in the hospital. They will decide if the patient needs surgery and how urgently.\nIf the patient requires admission, the nurse must check and record their vital signs, pain level and consciousness level. Any current dressing should be removed and the wound readied for review by the surgeon. Once this has occurred, the wound should be re-dressed as per Guideline 2, on wound care.\nThe following should be carried out as prescribed:\n- intravenous cannula inserted and bloods taken - antibiotics given - analgesia given - tetanus booster given, and possibly tetanus immunoglobulin - intravenous fluids administered.\nIf the patient requires surgery, they must be prepared as per the preoperative checklist.\n\n【107】 #Management in the operating theatre\nThe surgical team will perform a debridement on the weapon wound. This will involve removing all dead, damaged or infected tissue to promote optimal wound healing. The surgeon will apply a dressing of singlelayer gauze, covered by a bulky, absorbent dressing and held in place with a crepe bandage. This dressing is designed to absorb blood and exudate from the wound. Limbs with large wounds should be immobilized with a plaster of Paris backslab\nAfter the initial debridement, the surgeon will schedule a delayed primary closure (DPC), usually five days later A DPC involves suturing a wound closed, covering it with a split skin graft, or a combination of both. However, if the wound is very contaminated and more dead or infected tissue remains, a further debridement may be required. The surgeon will make this assessment during the planned DPC. If a re-debridement is to be performed, the wound and dressing must be left undisturbed for a further five days and the patient observed for signs of infection. Often the wound will be re-debrided once in surgery and then can be dressed on the ward, as per the surgeon's orders. Dressings should be changed regularly according to the doctor's orders until the wound is ready for a DPC.\n\n【108】 #Nursing care\nA dressing is only to be opened and dressed at the surgeon's instructions. The surgeon will write in the notes or on the bandage for the date of the next change of dressing, debridement or DPC.\nUpdate the patient's whiteboard and nursing notes with the date of the next change of dressing/debridement/\n\n【109】 #DPC\nIf exudate/blood soaks through the bandage, the dressing must not be removed but reinforced with extra layers of fluffy gauze and crepe bandage and the head nurse notified.\nThe nurse should observe the patient for signs of infection, including:\n- complaints of pain at the wound site - foul-smelling dressing - increased temperature - increased heart rate - excessive wound discharge - distension or swelling around the dressing At any sign of infection, document it and report it immediately to the head nurse and surgeon.\nICRC NURSING GUIDELINE 11\n\n【110】 #PREOPERATIVE PATIENT CARE OVERVIEW\nCare for a patient undergoing surgery begins preoperatively. It is important that the patient be assessed prior to surgery and that all necessary investigations be carried out and results communicated to the surgical team.\nRigorous preoperative care will ensure optimal patient safety. This includes:\n- physical preparation -checking for any comorbidities or illnesses and the overall health of patient - psychological preparation -ensuring the patient is educated on and understands the surgery, consent is obtained and stress is reduced\n- maintenance of the patient's privacy and dignity, respecting local customs.\n\n【111】 #OBJECTIVE\nTo ensure the nurse can confidently carry out preoperative assessment and care of all patients, including emergency cases, and can recognize when there may be an increased risk of complications.\n\n【112】 #ASSESSMENT\nA preoperative assessment should include taking a thorough history, conducting a physical examination and ordering tests History (usually taken by a clinician)\n- Medical history -History of the presenting illness -Previous medical history (any cardiac or respiratory issues, etc.)\n-Previous surgical/anaesthesia history -Medications -Allergies\n- Family history of any illnesses, surgery, etc.\n- Social history, including where they live and family support - Drug use -alcohol, smoking and illegal substances\n\n【113】 #Physical examination\n- The doctor should do a full physical examination, from head to toe.\nInvestigations (ordered by doctor as required)\n- Blood tests - Urine test - Pregnancy test - Electrocardiogram - X-rays\n\n【114】 #PREOPERATIVE CHECKLIST\nThe preoperative checklist should be filled out by the nurse the night before surgery\nThe morning of surgery, the following must be done before the operation is carried out:\n- Ensure the consent form has been signed by the patient (or their legal representative) and the patient understands the procedure\n- Check whether any pre-medication or intravenous fluids have been prescribed and whether they have been given.\n- Check and record the patient's vital signs and general physical and mental condition. If vital signs are abnormal, or if the patient has a cough or severe anxiety, notify the doctor.\n- Ensure the patient has showered/washed and is in a clean gown.\n- Remove any jewellery, dentures, hearing aids and glasses.\n- Shave the operative site, if required.\n- If applicable, follow the specific nursing guideline for bowel prep (Guideline 16) or skin grafts (Guideline 7).\n- Check that the patient is fasted and record the time.\n- Prepare the patient's file: ensure all blood and X-ray results, the consent form and any other paperwork are present\n- Put a name band on the patient.\n- When the patient is ready for surgery, call for a porter.\n- Adults: patients should be weighed on admission and have a recent weight recorded prior to surgery.\n\n【115】 #Emergency cases\nWhen a patient arrives in the hospital and needs emergency surgery, the following should be carried out as quickly and efficiently as possible, using all available skilled members of the team:\n- Vital signs should be checked and recorded - An intravenous cannula should be inserted, intravenous fluids started and bloods taken, if possible.\n- Prepare the consent form for signature.\n- Remove the patient's clothing, jewellery, etc. (keep them together in a safe place or hand them over to a relative) and wash the affected area if time allows.\n- Check and record weight if the patient is under 15 years old.\n- Record when the patient last ate/drank.\n- Administer and record any prescribed medication.\n\n【116】 - Be prepared to carry out preoperative invasive procedures as necessary (for example, inserting a chest drain, urinary catheter or nasogastric tube).\n- Ensure any relatives/carers are given an explanation of what is happening and kept up to date by a staff member.\n- Ensure the safe and efficient passage of the patient to the theatres. Prepare for the post-operative reception of the emergency patient in recovery, the high-dependency unit or the ward, as appropriate.\n- Ensure excellent communication throughout with all members of the surgical and patient-care teams.\n\n【117】 #Paediatrics\n- Remember children under 15 years old must be weighed.\n- If child has severe malaria, surgery may need to be delayed. Always monitor for fever and other signs of malaria. Carry out a malaria test if necessary.\n- A nutritional assessment should be done by the anaesthetist, and surgery should be avoided for malnourished children unless it is an emergency.\n\n【118】 #FASTING GUIDELINES\n- The night before surgery, the patient and their family should be informed about fasting times\n- Ensure all night staff members are aware of all patients' specific fasting times.\n- Put a \"nothing by mouth\" (nil per os/NPO) sign at the end of the patient's bed.\n\n【119】 #CONSENT OVERVIEW\nFor a patient to consent to treatment, they must understand and give permission before they receive any type of medical treatment, procedure, investigation, intervention or examination. The person has a right to make decisions about their own health-care needs. This includes the right to consent to receive care, decline care or to change their decision\n\n【120】 #TYPES OF CONSENT\n- Verbal: The patient says they agree to receive care, e.g. they say, \"Yes, I will go for an X-ray.\"\n- written: The patient signs a consent form for a procedure, e.g. surgery.\n- Implied: The patient gives non-verbal consent, e.g. by holding out their arm to have their blood pressure checked\n\n【121】 #INFORMED CONSENT\nFor consent to be valid, it must be voluntary and informed, and the person giving consent must have the capacity to make the decision.\n- Voluntary: The decision to consent or not to consent to treatment must be made by the person and not forced upon them.\n- Informed: The person must be given all the information about what the treatment involves, including benefits and risks, alternative treatments and expected outcomes.\n- capacity: The person must be capable of giving consent: They must not be under the influence of drugs, alcohol or mind-altering medications. They must be of sound mind.\n\n【122】 #SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES\n- children under 16: Their parent or legal guardian must give consent.\n- cognitive impairment: If a person has dementia, severe learning disabilities, brain damage, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or any other condition where their mind is impaired or disturbed and they are therefore unable to make an informed decision, the medical team will need to discuss what is best for the person and make a decision, and they will need to involve the family and next of kin (if they are present or contactable).\n- personal beliefs: If a person refuses treatment because of religious or cultural beliefs, this is their right.\nAs long as they understand the risks of refusing treatment and have the capacity to decide, treatment cannot be forced on them.\n- Cultural differences: In some cultures, a male relative or community elder has to give consent. In these cases, the nursing staff must be aware of and respect this requirement.\n- Exceptions: If a person is incapacitated (e.g. unconscious) and needs life-saving emergency treatment, consent is not needed\n\n【123】 #CONSENT FOR SURGERY\n- Consent is required before any surgical procedure or intervention.\n- It is the surgeon's responsibility to ensure informed and written consent is obtained before surgery.\n- Legal requirements and national regulations of the host country must be adhered to.\n- There should be a witness to the consent - The patient or guardian should sign the consent form with either a signature or thumbprint.\n- Consent should be obtained on the ward, not in the recovery area or anaesthesia bay.\n\n【124】 #CONSENT FORM\nThe consent form should be clear and legible and include:\n- a statement that the planned procedure has been explained to the person/their guardian and that they understand the purpose and potential risks\n- the nature of the planned procedure - the full name and signature or thumbprint of the person or their guardian.\n- the date of signing - the name and signature of the surgeon.\n\n【125】 #TIPS FOR GAINING CONSENT\nIf a person or their family member refuses to consent to a procedure, try the following:\n- Be prepared for obtaining consent to take some time and discussion, and be patient with them during the process\n- Be ready to answer further questions.\n- Make sure the patient and their relatives understand the risks of refusing the procedure.\n- If there is a language barrier, ensure an interpreter is available.\n- Ensure consent forms are translated into the local language(s).\n- Request support from the mental-health team to explore and alleviate any possible cognitive impediments to giving consent.\n- In the case of amputations, enlist the support of a successful fellow amputee with a prosthesis to demonstrate the quality of life post-amputation.\n- Be respectful, kind and non-judgemental in the event of a refusal to consent.\n\n【126】 #POST-OPERATIVE CARE OVERVIEW\nPatients who have undergone surgery require close observation, first in the recovery room and then on the ward The ICRC's Anaesthesia Handbook strongly recommends using a designated recovery area for patients or for patients to recover in the operating theatre. Where this is not possible, the patient should be nursed on the ward in a visible bed (close to the nurses' station) and be monitored closely.\nA recovery room (or \"RR\") is also known as a post-anaesthesia care unit (or \"PACU\"). It is where patients receive the short-to-medium-term care that they require following a general, spinal or epidural anaesthesia until they are stable, conscious, alert and thus safe to return to the ward. One-to-one nursing care is required in a recovery room until the patient can maintain their own airway, is well oxygenated and has stable vital signs.\n\n【127】 #OBJECTIVE\nTo ensure the nurse can optimize patients' post-operative condition and minimize the risk of post-operative complications by delivering high-quality care both in the recovery room and on the ward.\n\n【128】 #NURSING CARE IN THE RECOVERY ROOM\n\n【129】 The recovery nurse should use the recovery-room chart to document care.\nThe patient should receive one-to-one care. The following should be monitored at least every 15 minutes, or more frequently if required:\n- Airway -Check the patient's airway and ensure it is patent, ensure their head is elevated to keep the airway open, and if there are signs of obstruction perform a head-tilt/chin-lift and call for help.\nIf necessary, ensure an oropharyngeal (Guedel) airway or laryngeal mask airway remains in position and patent until the patient starts to wake up and resist.\n- Breathing -Check if oxygen therapy is required and administer it accordingly. Monitor and record the patient's respiratory rate and oxygen saturation.\n- Circulation -Monitor and record the patient's pulse and blood pressure Check their skin colour and any changes to skin colour. Look for bleeding and report it if present. Monitor and record the patient's peripheral pulses if necessary.\n- Disability -Check the patient's neurological status using their AVPU score (Alert, Voice, Pain, Unresponsive), check their blood sugar if they are diabetic and check their pain level.\n- Exposure -Ensure the patient is kept warm and check their temperature.\n- Other -Check that the wound is not bleeding and the dressing is intact, check all drains and catheters, check whether intravenous (IV) fluids are needed, and ensure the IV line is patent.\n- Spinal anaesthesia -Make neurovascular observations, including for limb sensation.\n- Control the patient's pain and nausea/vomiting in recovery. Inform the anaesthetist if additional medication is required.\nRequirements for the patient to return to the ward:\n- The patient is conscious - The patient is maintaining their own airway.\n- The IV cannula is in situ If all the above are met, ensure the anaesthetist gives permission for the patient to return to the ward.\nCall the ward and ask the ward nurse and porter to come and collect the patient.\nGive a verbal handover and all completed documentation to the ward nurse. Provide information specifically on the patient's condition, surgical interventions, anaesthesia type, post-op orders, drugs given in recovery, vital signs in recovery and any specific concerns or instructions.\n\n【130】 #Equipment required in the recovery room\n- Oxygen cylinder and spare - Oxygen masks and tubing - Suction machine and suction equipment - Basic airway equipment: oropharyngeal airways, nasopharyngeal airways, bag-valve mask - Monitoring equipment: blood-pressure machine, pulse oximeter, clock, stethoscope, thermometer - Trolley set up with gloves, tissues, a sharps bin, dressing material, cannulation material, IV fluids and giving sets\n- Emergency bag or cupboard - Defibrillator (where available)\n- Cleaning material and a clinical-waste bin\nThe recovery room must be well lit and spacious. It must not be used as a storage facility.\n\n【131】 #POST-OPERATIVE NURSING CARE ON THE WARD\nOnce the patient arrives in the ward from operating theatre/recovery, the nurse should make an assessment of the patient and ensure they are comfortable.\nThe following should then be monitored:\n\n【132】 #Observations\n- Observations should be made on the patient's arrival on the ward and every 30 minutes for four hours, and then every four hours thereafter if the patient is stable.\n- Blood pressure, pulse, respiration rate, temperature, oxygen saturation levels, and AVPU and pain scores should be checked and recorded\n\n【133】 #Medication orders\n- Check prescriptions for medications, including analgesia, antibiotics and IV fluids.\n- Ensure required medications are given.\n- Check that the IV line is patent and IV fluids are running as per prescription.\n\n【134】 #Wound\n- Check all wound dressings for signs of bleeding; if there is bleeding, reinforce the dressing and inform the head nurse or surgeon. Observe the surrounding skin for signs of swelling, and check peripheral pulses if necessary.\n- Make sure dressings are intact - Ensure the next intervention (change of dressing, removal of sutures, etc.) is documented and written on the patient's whiteboard\n\n【135】 #Catheters/drains\n- Check that drains or catheters are secure and patent - Document the amount and type of drainage.\n- Do not allow catheter/drainage bags to lie on the floor.\n\n【136】 #Intake/output\n- Check post-op orders regarding diet.\n- If patient is to have nothing by mouth (nil per os/NPO), ensure the NPO sign is fully visible at the end of their bed. Ensure the patient and their relatives/carers are fully aware that the patient can have nothing by mouth.\n- Commence a fluid-balance chart -record all input and output (urine, faeces, drainage, intravenous fluids, medications, oral intake, etc) over a 24-hour period.\n- Monitor and document when patient passes urine for the first time post-operatively.\n\n【137】 #Hygiene/positioning\n- Follow post-op orders regarding positioning of the patient.\n- In collaboration with the physiotherapist, ensure the patient is comfortable and in the correct position.\n- Attend to pressure-area care every two hours while the patient is immobile.\n- Support the physiotherapist with specific mobility requirements.\n- Assist with hygiene and toileting needs and enlist the support of relatives/carers if available and appropriate.\nEncourage deep breathing exercises and early mobilization if appropriate.\n\n【138】 #Spinal anaesthesia\nPatients who receive spinal anaesthesia must be observed closely to ensure that paralysis does not spread and that full sensation returns over time.\nCheck the following every 30 minutes until the patient has full sensation:\n- respiratory rate - blood pressure - heart rate - sensation in and movement of legs.\nObserve and report when the patient passes urine. If the patient is unable to void, check for a distended bladder. If after six to eight hours the patient has not voided, contact the doctor.\nThe patient does not have to lie flat; they can have their head/upper body elevated on pillows. As the spinal anaesthesia wears off, the patient will need analgesia to maintain pain control.\n\n【139】 #Local anaesthesia/regional blocks\nCheck for any reactions to the local anaesthetic and inform the anaesthetist if you observe or the patient reports:\n- dizziness - headache - blurred vision - twitching muscles - pins and needles\n\n【140】 #Ketamine\nKetamine is the ICRC's anaesthetic of choice for major surgery in low-resource environments.\nNB Ketamine can raise the patient's blood pressure and heart rate, increasing cardiac output.\nOther side effects include:\n- hypersalivation (may need suction)\n- nightmares or hallucinations. ICRC NURSING GUIDELINE 14\n\n【141】 #PAIN MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW\nThe International Association for the Study of Pain defines pain as an \"unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage\". Pain is either nociceptive or neuropathic.\nNociceptive pain is pain that follows the normal pain pathway that happens as a result of tissue injury or damage. Neuropathic pain is related to abnormal processing in the nervous system, when nerve injury or dysfunctions happen and result in pain.\nThere are three types of pain:\n- Acute pain: Lasts less than three months. Causes can be surgery, trauma or musculoskeletal, visceral or post-procedure injury.\n- Chronic pain: Lasts more than three months. Causes can be non-malignant conditions or neuropathic, inflammatory or musculoskeletal conditions.\n- Cancer pain: Is related to a malignancy or cancer treatment.\nThe ICRC Anaesthesia Handbook states that pain should be treated by balancing the 3 Ps: psychology, physical methods and pharmacology (drugs).\n\n【142】 #OBJECTIVE\nTo ensure the nurse is capable of providing high-quality patient pain management through interventions that effectively support and manage pain and related stress for patients.\n\n【143】 #ASSESSMENT\nSigns and symptoms of pain include:\n- complaint of pain - crying, moaning - tenseness - anxiety - sweating - pale skin - restlessness - increased blood pressure - increased heart rate\n\n【144】 #Pain assessment\nA person's pain level should be assessed prior to giving them analgesia. It is important to assess pain properly. The mnemonic \"PQRST\" can help. It stands for:\n- P: Provocation/Palliation -What caused the pain? What makes it better/worse? What were you doing when the pain started?\n- Q: Quality/Quantity -What does the pain feel like? Is it sharp, dull, stabbing, burning, etc.?\n- R: Region/Radiation -Where is the pain located? Does it radiate, or is it localized?\n- S: Severity -How serious is it? How long does it last?\n- T: Timing -When did it start? How long does it last? How often do you get it? Is it sudden or gradual?\nWhen does it occur?\n\n【145】 #Pain scale\nTo assess a person's level of pain, various scales can be used depending on their culture, age and level of literacy/numeracy.\n\n【146】 #Verbal scale\nAsk the patient to describe their pain using one of the words below:\n- None - Mild - Moderate - Severe\n\n【147】 #Number scale\nAsk the patient to rate their pain from zero to three:\n0-No pain 1-Mild pain 2-Moderate pain 3-Severe pain\n\n【148】 #Faces scale\nThis works particularly well for paediatric patients or where there is a language barrier.\n\n【149】 #Analgesia\nThe nurse should give the patient analgesia as prescribed by the anaesthetist. It is the nurse's role to check the analgesia is effective and is managing the pain. If it is not, they must report to the doctor. The patient's pain level should be assessed every time their vital signs are checked and also 30 minutes after any analgesia is given.\nANALGESIA DOSING FOR ADULTS (SEE ICRC ANAESTHESIA HANDBOOK, P. 79)\n\n【150】 #Drug\nRoute/dose Comment\n\n【151】 #NURSING CARE\nThe nurse should take a patient's complaints of pain seriously. In addition to pharmacology, there are other methods to control pain. The nurse can:\n- discuss the patient's pain with them, listen and be supportive - identify the causes of pain and try to remedy them\n- change the position of patient - ensure pressure-area care is carried out and inspect all pressure areas - massage the area if culturally appropriate - use distraction techniques -reading, games, movies, music, jokes, etc.\n- take them outside for a change of scenery - encourage friends or family to visit - hold a multidisciplinary meeting (including mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) staff member and the physiotherapist) to discuss other methods of pain control\n- enlist the support of MHPSS to explore psychological causes of pain and possible treatment methods - encourage a warm shower or wash - provide an ice pack or warm pack - involve the physiotherapist and encourage deep breathing and gentle mobilization - encourage meditation.\n\n【152】 #SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS\n- Always document a patient's pain level in the patient notes.\n- The ICRC is limited in what types of analgesia can be used, and it is important to follow the protocol.\nThere are some places where access to strong analgesia and opioids is very restricted.\n- When a patient has received opioids, their respiratory rate must be monitored carefully. There is a risk of respiratory depression, so oxygen should be available.\n- For nerve pain, gabapentin or carbamazepine should be used.\n\n【153】 #ICRC NURSING GUIDELINE 15 CARING FOR A PATIENT WITH A STOMA OVERVIEW\nThe word \"stoma\" is used to describe a surgically created opening that connects the bowel or urinary tract to the outside environment to drain the contents externally.\nThere are three types of stomas:\n- Colostomy: Part of the large intestine is diverted out through the abdomen; it drains solid to semi-solid material.\n- Urostomy: The ureters are diverted externally to bypass the bladder; it drains urine.\nStomas can be:\n- temporary, diverting contents externally to allow the bowel/bladder to heal or rest and to protect an anastomosis - permanent, after resection of the rectum or all/part of the colon when the bowel cannot be restored.\n\n【154】 #OBJECTIVE\nTo ensure the nurse is capable of providing high-quality care to a patient with a stoma.\n\n【155】 #REASONS FOR A STOMA\n- Penetrating injury to the bowel, rectum or urinary tract - Vesical-vaginal or rectovaginal fistula - Cancer - Crohn's disease - Ulcerative colitis\n\n【156】 #NURSING CARE\nPreoperative care\n- Spend time explaining to the patient the reasons for the stoma, how it will be managed and whether it will be temporary or permanent.\n- Ensure the surgeon marks the stoma site.\n- Educate the patient on how to successfully accept to and manage the stoma bag.\n- If necessary, ask mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) to provide additional psychological support to the patient\n\n【157】 #Post-operative care\nWhen the patient returns to ward after surgery, the observations and documentation below must be carried out\n\n【158】 #Observations\nCheck and record vital signs as per Guideline 13 (on post-operative care) and then every four hours for the first 48 hours.\nAlso check the stoma every four hours for 48 hours, observing the following:\n- Colour -Dark pink/red: The stoma is healthy with good blood supply.\n-Pale pink: The stoma has decreased perfusion.\n-Dark red/purple: Bruising is present.\n-Grey/black: There is ischemia or necrosis. This is an emergency -call the surgeon immediately.\n-Whitish: There is decreased blood flow, and the stoma is dying. This is also an emergency.\n- Appearance -A healthy stoma will be red/pink and moist.\n-Shape: Is it round, oval or irregular?\n- Skin around stoma -The colour should be same as the rest of the skin.\n-Check for swelling or bruising -Integrity: Is the skin intact or macerated? Is there any rash, ulcer or broken skin?\n-Turgor: Is it soft, firm or elastic?\n- Wound -Is there pain?\n-Measure the wound size.\n-Is there exudate?\n-Are there any signs of infection?\n- Protrusion -Normal: 0.5-1 cm above skin level.\n-Retracted: Below skin level.\n-Protruded: 2-3 cm above skin level.\n\n【159】 #Documentation\n- Record when the patient passes flatus.\n- Use either a stool chart or a fluid-balance chart.\nCHANGING THE STOMA BAG 3. Place paper towels under the stoma bag to protect the patient.\n4. Wash your hands with soap and water.\n5. Put on gloves and an apron.\n6. Place a privacy screen around the patient.\n7. Carefully open the outlet of the stoma bag and empty the contents into a jug or emesis bag. Discard in the clinical-waste bin.\n8. Slowly and gently remove the stoma bag. Peel the adhesive off of the skin.\n9. Discard the bag in the clinical-waste bin.\n10. Remove excess faeces with a damp wipe (saline-soaked gauze or wipe).\n11. Examine the skin/stoma for pain, ulceration, colour, etc.\n12. Wash the skin and stoma site with 0.9% saline and sterile gauze.\n13. Dry gently with sterile gauze.\n14. Measure the stoma and cut the new bag to size, leaving an extra 3 mm of space to go around the stoma.\n15. Apply a new bag around the stoma.\n16. Dispose of waste.\n17. Perform hand hygiene.\n18. Document in the patient notes the change of bag, output, and condition of the stoma and surrounding skin.\n\n【160】 #COMPLICATIONS\nMonitor the patient for any complications and report to the head nurse and or surgeon any of the below:\n- excessive bleeding or bleeding that does not stop - prolapsed or retracted stoma - signs of ischemia or necrosis - wound breakdown and breakdown of skin surrounding the stoma Change the bag daily and clean the wound site.\n\n【161】 #Wound dehisces and becomes an open wound\nPost-operative stoma necrosis or wound infection\n\n【162】 #NUTRITION\nEncourage the patient to drink two litres of water per day.\nOnce the patient can eat, ensure the diet is light and low in fibre.\nThe patient should avoid the following foods, as they can cause a blockage, excess gas and pain:\n- nuts and seeds - legumes, e.g. beans - gum - fizzy drinks - the skin of fruit/vegetables - spicy food - onions, cabbage, garlic - dairy.\nIf the patient is having diarrhoea, encourage foods that will thicken output, such as bananas, apple sauce, peanut butter and boiled rice Report persistent diarrhoea to the doctor\n\n【163】 #MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT\nThe creation of a stoma can be very frightening or distressing for patients and can result in increased stress and anxiety. If possible, refer the patient to the hospital MHPSS support worker. The patient should receive an MHPSS visit both pre-and post-operatively for additional support.\nOstomy patients may be anxious about the following:\n- the primary disease and surgery - changes to their appearance and body image - managing the stoma and emptying it - rehabilitation - self-care - how they may be affected financially - the implications the stoma may have on their social and home life - a vague sense of unease.\n\n【164】 #DISCHARGE OF PATIENT\n- Ensure the patient can confidently change and empty their stoma bag.\n- Provide the patient with supplies for at least two weeks.\n- Make sure a follow-up appointment is booked.\n- If the patient is unable to return to your facility, ensure that there is an alternate facility accessible to the patient for the necessary outpatient follow-up. Previously, when bowel surgery was performed, the patient would be given preoperative bowel preparation, and their bowels would need to run clear before surgery was undertaken. This was usually uncomfortable, undignified and very stressful for the patient.\n\n【165】 #OBJECTIVE\nTo ensure the nurse is capable of providing high-quality to care to a patient requiring an enema before bowel surgery.\n\n【166】 #PROCEDURE\nBefore a patient has an anterior resection, colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy, it is important to explain the procedure to the patient and why they need a preoperative enema. Ensure consent is gained.\n\n【167】 #Night before surgery\n- Ensuring the necessary privacy of the patient, administer the enema per rectum as prescribed. If a fleet enema is not available, use warm sterile water or saline.\n- Check and record the patient's vital signs afterwards.\n- Document the enema on a fluid-balance chart.\n- If the patient is diabetic, check their blood glucose level.\nEnsure patient follows normal fasting times .\n\n【168】 #Day of surgery\n- Check and record the patient's vital signs and maintain the fluid-balance chart.\n- Carry out the preoperative checklist.\n- Check for a bowel movement and document in the patient notes. 2. Ensure the patient's privacy.\n\n【169】 #HOW TO GIVE AN ENEMA\n3. Wash your hands and put on a plastic apron and gloves.\n4. Check that the enema is intact and has not expired. Warm the solution to the desired temperature, if possible.\n5. Position the patient on their left side, lying with the knees bent and drawn up.\n6. Place an incontinence pad underneath the patient.\n7. Break the enema seal. Lubricate the tip. Remove any air from the nozzle.\n8. Gently separate the buttocks and locate the anus. Insert the lubricated nozzle into the rectum slowly to a depth of approximately 10 cm (in adults).\n9. Gently expel the contents into the rectum.\n10. Keeping the container compressed, withdraw the container.\n11. Attend to perianal hygiene.\n12. Ask the patient to retain the enema for as long as possible, ideally 15 to 20 minutes.\n13. Provide a commode or bed pan if needed.\n14. Dispose of any waste, remove the apron and gloves and wash your hands.\n\n【170】 #ICRC NURSING GUIDELINE 17 CARING FOR A PATIENT WITH A URINARY CATHETER OVERVIEW\nA urinary catheter is a specific tube inserted into the bladder via the urethra and usually held in place with an inflated integral balloon. Types of catheters include indwelling (two-or three-way), intermittent or suprapubic\nThe introduction of a urinary catheter is an invasive procedure that risks causing an infection or trauma.\nTherefore, the procedure must be conducted aseptically by a skilled, trained nurse. Catheter-associated urinary-tract infections are a significant problem, and catheters should be removed as soon as they are no longer required\n\n【171】 #OBJECTIVE\nTo ensure the nurse is capable of providing high-quality care to a patient with a urinary catheter.\n\n【172】 #INDICATIONS\n- To drain the bladder prior to, during or after surgery - To determine residual urine - To irrigate the bladder - To bypass an obstruction - To relieve urinary retention - To accurately measure urinary output\n\n【173】 #CONTRAINDICATIONS\nWhen there is suspected urethral injury owing to pelvic trauma, a urethral catheter must not be inserted.\n\n【174】 #CAUTION\nThe doctor must insert the catheter if the patient has urethral stricture or a history of recent urinary-tract surgery.\n\n【175】 #Sizing\nIt is important to choose the correct size of catheter, which should be the smallest size that will allow ad equate urinary drainage. A larger-gauge catheter may be needed if there is debris or clots in the urine or for larger adults 1. Explain the procedure to the patient and get consent.\n2. Place a privacy screen around the bed.\n3. Prepare the trolley, put all materials on the bottom shelf and bring to the bedside.\n4. Assist the patient into the supine position.\n5. Ask the patient to remove their undergarments, and cover them with a towel.\n6. Wash your hands with soap and water or rub them with alcohol-based hand gel. 9. Have buddy nurse pour sterile saline into gallipot (kidney dish), without touching the sterile field.\n10. Open the catheter onto the sterile field.\n11. Clean your hands with alcohol-based hand gel.\n12. Put on sterile gloves.\n13. Place a sterile towel over the patient's thighs; do not touch the patient.\n14. Use one hand to lift the penis and retract the foreskin (if not circumcised).\n15. Using your other (sterile) hand, clean the urethral opening with saline-soaked gauze (using forceps).\n16. Discard swabs into the clinical-waste bin.\n17. If available, insert xylocaine gel or lubricating jelly into the urethral opening and hold in place for two to three minutes.\n18. With one hand, hold the penis firmly and raise it; with your sterile hand, insert the catheter 15 to 25 cm, until urine flows out.\n19. Inflate the balloon with 10 ml of sterile water for adults, or 5 ml for children.\n20. Attach the urinary bag to the catheter.\n21. Tape the catheter to the side of the patient's leg for support. 27. Pack up the trolley and equipment; document in the patient notes the date and time of insertion, the size of catheter used, the batch number and any concerns.\n\n【176】 #PROCEDURE FOR FEMALES\nPre-procedure 1. Explain the procedure to the patient and get consent.\n2. Place a privacy screen around the bed.\n3. Prepare the trolley, put all materials on the bottom shelf and bring to the bedside.\n4. Assist the patient into the supine position.\n5. Ask the patient to remove their undergarments, and cover them with a towel.\n6. Wash your hands with soap and water or rub them with alcohol-based hand gel.\n7. Put on the apron.\nProcedure 8. Using gauze-soaked swabs, separate the labia minora so the urethral meatus is visible.\n9. Clean around the area with 0.9% saline, in downward strokes.\n10. Place lubricating jelly or xylocaine gel on the tip of the catheter.\n11. Place the catheter tip into the urethral orifice in an upwards direction; advance 5 to 6 cm.\n12. Urine should start to present; then push the catheter in further, to about 6 to 8 cm in total.\n13. Inflate the catheter balloon via a syringe with 10 ml of sterile water.\n14. Connect the catheter to the urinary bag and secure to the patient's leg with tape for support. 20. Pack up the trolley and equipment; document in the patient notes the date and time of insertion, the size of catheter used, the batch number and any concerns.\nNB It is easier to have two nurses to perform catheter insertion: one nurse to perform the procedure and the other to assist. The buddy nurse can draw up sterile water with the 10 ml syringe and can also apply lubricating jelly or xylocaine gel to the catheter (using non-touch technique).\n\n【177】 #Removing a catheter\nIt is best to remove the urinary catheter in the morning so that the patient can be monitored for resumption of normal micturition during the day. Encourage the patient to drink two litres of water throughout the day.\nAdvise the patient to tell a nurse when they pass urine.\n\n【178】 #PROCEDURE\n1. Explain the procedure to the patient.\n2. Set up a trolley with your equipment.\n3. Put a privacy screen next to the patient.\n4. Wash your hands with soap and water or rub them with alcohol-based hand gel.\n5. Put on gloves and an apron.\n6. Attach a 10 ml syringe to the end of the catheter balloon port and aspirate the full 10 ml of water.\n7. Ask the patient to breathe in and out; when they exhale, gently remove the catheter.\n8. Clean around the vagina/penis with saline-soaked gauze.\n9. Dispose of waste in the clinical waste bag.\n10. Clean the trolley.\n11. Perform hand hygiene.\n12. Document in the patient notes the time and date of catheter removal, the amount drained and any concerns.\n13. Monitor when the patient passes urine; if there is no micturition within six to eight hours, report this to the doctor.\n\n【179】 #NURSING CARE FOR A PATIENT WITH A URINARY CATHETER\n- Encourage an intake of oral fluids -two litres per day.\n- Keep an accurate fluid-balance chart.\n- Keep the catheter below the level of the bladder.\n- Do not leave the catheter bag on the floor.\n- Check that the urine is clear - Ensure the catheter is patent and draining.\n- Ensure the bag is emptied before it reaches maximum capacity.\n\n【180】 #Suprapubic catheters\nA suprapubic catheter is a catheter that is placed into the bladder through an incision in the abdominal wall, above the pubic bone. It should be inserted by a doctor.\n\n【181】 #Indications\n- To manage a neuropathic bladder - For long-term use, e.g. in spinal cord injuries - After surgery to the lower urinary tract\n\n【182】 #Care\n- Once the incision site has healed, after approximately seven days, clean the site using saline and gauze as per Guideline 2, on wound care.\n- Check daily for patency and drainage.\n- Monitor for signs of infection at the incision site - Maintain a fluid-balance chart.\n- Encourage oral fluids -two litres per day.\n\n【183】 #Intermittent catheters\nAn intermittent catheter is a urinary catheter that can be inserted and then immediately removed. It is used to empty the bladder and collect a urine sample. Inserting it involves the same technique as for an indwelling urethral catheter\nA patient can be educated to perform this themselves at home if they have a bladder that does not drain.\n\n【184】 #LINKS\nCompetency checklist for inserting a urinary catheter\n\n【185】 #CARING FOR A PATIENT WITH A TRACHEOSTOMY OVERVIEW\nA tracheostomy is the surgical creation of an opening (stoma) in the trachea at the level of the neck. This secures the airway and provides a direct air passage to the lungs. It is always carried out by a doctor and can be performed as an emergency procedure or in surgery. A tracheostomy can be either temporary or permanent.\nA patient with a tracheostomy must be nursed initially in a high-dependency unit and thereafter always close to the nurses' station for ease of monitoring.\n\n【186】 #OBJECTIVE\nTo ensure the nurse is capable of providing high-quality care to a patient with a tracheostomy.\n\n【187】 #NURSING CARE\nWhen looking after a patient with a tracheostomy, the nurse must pay attention to the following:\n\n【188】 #Observations\n- Observe the patient and airway.\n- Check the patient's vital signs regularly.\n- Look for any signs of respiratory distress.\n- Ensure the airway is open and secure.\n\n【189】 #Humidification\nWhen a tracheostomy is in situ, air is no longer filtered, warmed or humidified by the nose before entry to the lungs, so the nurse must humidify the air. This can be done using:\n- a Thermovent (if available) -a disposable plastic device that covers the tracheostomy site and humidifies the air.\n\n【190】 #Hygiene\n- Help the patient wash, as water must not enter the tracheostomy tube.\n- Mouth care must be given regularly, at least four times a day.\n\n【191】 #Nutrition\n\n【192】 - The patient will require a high-protein, nutritious diet to promote wound healing and a return to good health - Patients with a tracheostomy tube may have swallowing problems or be at risk of aspiration.\n\n【193】 #Oral feeding\n- An inflated cuff compresses the oesophagus and can make swallowing difficult.\n- Oral feeding should ideally be started with a deflated cuff.\n- Confirm with the doctor that the patient can tolerate cuff deflation during oral feeding. If the cuff is deflated, ensure this is noted and the cuff reinflated after feeding.\n\n【194】 #Wound care\n- The tracheostomy dressing must be changed daily, more frequently if soiled.\n- Observe the skin around the stoma for redness and any breakdown.\n\n【195】 #Communication\n- The patient will not be able to communicate orally. Ensure the patient and their carers understand this.\n- Establish a way to communicate with the patient:\n-If the patient can write, provide a pen and paper, whiteboard, blackboard, etc.\n\n【196】 #TRACHEOSTOMY DRESSING\nTracheostomy sites should be assessed and cleaned daily, using aseptic technique. Tracheostomy dressing changes always require two trained, skilled nurses. It is important the tracheostomy wound be kept clean and dry in order to prevent any infection. If the dressing becomes wet or soiled, it needs to be changed more frequently.\nEquipment required 17d.\ntie is cut at an angle 17c.\n- 7d.\n\n【197】 #TRACHEAL SUCTIONING\nThis should only be done by a fully trained and skilled nurse.\n\n【198】 #PROCEDURE REMOVING A TRACHEOSTOMY TUBE\nWhen the tracheostomy tube is no longer required, it is the doctor's responsibility to perform the removal procedure. When the tracheostomy tube is removed, the stoma site should be covered with an airtight, firm pressure dressing to prevent the formation of a fistula. The site should be monitored for signs of infection.\nIt is also the doctor's responsibility to change the tracheostomy tube and/or inner cannula if present. This is not the role of the nurse\n\n【199】 #SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS\nThe following equipment must remain at the bedside of a patient with a tracheostomy in case of an emergency:\n- suction machine fully dedicated to the patient - suction catheters, 12 French scale (FR) or 14 FR - tracheal dilators, if available - spare tracheostomy tubes, one the same size and one smaller - bag-valve mask - tape - personal protective equipment.\nOxygen equipment should be readily available.\n\n【200】 #CARING FOR A PATIENT WITH A CHEST DRAIN OVERVIEW\nA chest drain is a tube inserted into the thoracic cavity to remove air and/or fluid from the pleural space. This allows for adequate expansion of the lung and the restoration of negative pressure in the thoracic cavity.\nIf an abnormal amount of fluid or air collects in the pleural space, it can compress the lung, causing it to partially or fully collapse and compromising breathing.\nThe surgeon inserts a chest drain into the fourth or fifth intercostal space, anterior to the axillary line just above the ribs. This is usually carried out in the operating theatre, but in an emergency it can be performed in the emergency room or on the ward.\nChest drains are usually connected to an underwater seal drainage system, which enables the one-way movement of fluid or air out of the thoracic cavity and into the collection bottle.\nCaring for a patient with a chest drain is complex, and proper management is necessary to prevent lifethreatening complications.\n\n【201】 #OBJECTIVE\nTo ensure the nurse is capable of providing high-quality care to a patient with a chest drain.\n\n【202】 #INDICATIONS\n- Pneumothorax: air in the pleural space - Haemothorax: blood in the pleural space - Empyema: pus in the pleural space - Pleural effusion: excessive amounts of fluid in the pleural space - Post-operatively, following thoracic, cardiac, oesophageal or spinal surgery\n\n【203】 #Management post-insertion\nOnce the doctor has inserted the chest drain and the patient is back on the ward or in the emergency room, the nurse should do the following:\n- Ensure a follow up chest X-ray has been requested (to check the position of the drain and whether the lung has reinflated).\n- Check that the drain is well secured - Ensure the drain is not clamped and is patent and draining.\n- Check and record the nature of the drainage -quantity, colour, etc.\n- Monitor for the presence of bubbling or swinging of the liquid in the collection bottle\n\n【204】 #Monitoring\nThe following should be monitored and checked by the nursing team:\nPatient assessment:\n- Vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, temperature, oxygen saturation levels) should be checked every 15 minutes for the first hour post-insertion, then every hour for four hours, and then every four hours if stable.\n- Monitor the patient for signs of respiratory distress, such as dyspnoea, increased restlessness/anxiety, tachycardia or hypotension, oxygen saturation levels under 94%. If such signs are present, call the doctor -the patient may need oxygen therapy.\n\n【205】 #Pain control:\n- Chest drains can be painful, and the patient may require regular analgesia.\n\n【206】 #Drain insertion site:\n- Check that the dressing is clean and intact - Check the site for signs of infection, and report them if found.\n\n【207】 #Chest drain and tubing:\n- The drain should always remain below chest level to facilitate drainage.\n- The tubing must not be kinked and must have no obstructions.\n- Ensure all connections are secure.\n- Ensure the drain is secure. Measure and record the length of the drain to ensure it has not moved.\n- The water seal must be 2 cm at all times so that the end tubing is not exposed to air.\n\n【208】 #Suction:\n- Suction is not always needed and has been linked to an increased risk of tissue trauma and persistent air leaks.\n- If the doctor orders suction it can be used to encourage the removal of fluid/air.\n- Low-pressure suction is recommended.\n\n【209】 #Stripping and milking chest drains:\n- Milking the tubing to keep the tube patent should be avoided. It is no longer recommended because it increases negative pressure in the intrathoracic cavity and can cause pain, bleeding and trauma.\n- If the tubing is occluded or blocked, it should be replaced with new tubing, not milked.\nDrainage:\n- The type of drainage (i.e. colour, consistency and amount) should be checked and recorded every four hours.\n- This should be recorded on the chest-drain chart.\n- Every 24 hours, the amount drained should be marked on the drainage bottle along with the date and time using a permanent marker or other pen.\nPhysiotherapy:\n- It is very important to involve the physiotherapist from the time of insertion.\n- Chest physiotherapy will help the lungs expand.\n- The physiotherapist will assist the patient with deep breathing exercises, coughing and postural drainage Wound management:\n- Leave the dressing intact for 24 hours post-insertion.\n- After 24 hours, only change the dressing if it is wet/soiled or if there are signs of infection.\n- Examine the dressing daily.\n- If the dressing needs changing, follow Guideline 2, on wound care: remove the old dressing, cleanse the area with normal saline, dry, apply gauze around the tube, and secure it with a clear/waterproof dressing - Unnecessary dressing changes increase the risk of dislodging the drain.\n\n【210】 #Documentation:\nIn the patient notes, the nurse should document when drain was inserted, the type of drain, whether there is suction and the general condition of patient Every four hours after insertion, the drain chart should be filled out with:\n- the colour of drainage - the total volume of drainage - the volume drained in the last 24 hours - the presence of swinging - the presence and frequency of bubbling - the suction setting, if suction is on - an assessment of the insertion site.\nSwinging:\n- Swinging is the rise and fall of fluid in the tubing, which shows that pressure is changing when the patient inhales and exhales.\n- If there is no swinging, the drain may be occluded or may not be in the pleural space.\n- No swinging can also mean the lung has re-expanded or suction is being applied.\n- Notify the doctor if swinging stops.\nBubbling:\n- Bubbling means air is being removed from the pleural space.\n- Continuous bubbling could mean there is an air leak in the underwater seal, in the lung or in the drainage system. You must notify the doctor.\n- A continuous and significant air leak is a sign of a bronchopleural fistula.\n\n【211】 #Equipment at bedside:\nIn case accidental dislodging or damage to the drainage bottle occurs, the following should be kept in a tray by the bedside:\n- a dressing pack - gloves - two tubing clamps.\n\n【212】 #Patient transport:\nDo not clamp the tube when transporting or moving patient with a chest drain.\n- Ensure the chest drain and tubing are secure and kept below the level of patient's chest.\n- The nurse should escort the patient when they are transported.\n- Clamping increases the risk of tension pneumothorax.\n\n【213】 #Clamping:\nDrains are only to be clamped (and only by the surgeon) in the following situations:\n- if the drainage tubes and underwater seal bottle need to be changed - when carrying out a clamping trial for a pneumothorax\n- when it is necessary to reconnect a tube that has accidentally disconnected, resulting in the underwater seal being lost\nIf the drain is clamped, it should be unclamped by the surgeon as soon as possible.\nA clamp that has been applied might be overlooked when the patient is handed over during shift changes of medical personnel. When handing over a patient or after an intervention, always look over the entire length of the tubing to check for an applied clamp.\n\n【214】 #Emergency scenario:\nIf the drain dislodges:\n- call for help - put on gloves - pinch the wound edges together - apply an occlusive dressing - monitor the patient's vital signs.\n- reconnect a new system - inform the doctor - monitor the patient's vitals.\n\n【215】 #CHANGING DRAINAGE BOTTLE\nThe drainage bottle needs changed when it is over three quarters full, when the sterility of the underwater seal drainage system (UWSD) is compromised or when the bottle breaks. The doctor will order the bottle change.\nEquipment needed 4. Prepare the new UWSD as per the manufacturer guidelines.\n5. Undo the tape around the tubing that connects to the bottle.\n6. Clamp the chest drain close to the chest wall with two clamps.\n7. Put on gloves.\n8. Disconnect the old UWSD and remove it.\n9. Connect the new bottle and tubing to the clamped chest tube.\n10. Unclamp the chest drain.\n11. Ensure the new bottle is securely attached, and secure it in position below chest-level.\n12. Dispose of waste in the clinical-waste bin.\n13. Remove your gloves and perform hand hygiene.\n14. Document the amount of fluid discarded in the patient notes and on the chart.\n15. Observe the patient for any respiratory changes.\n\n【216】 #REMOVING A CHEST DRAIN\nA chest drain is only to be removed when ordered by the doctor, and this request must be documented in the patient notes\nThe drain should be removed either by two experienced, skilled nurses or by the doctor and one nurse.\nIndications for removal:\n- There is an absence of bubbling (a sign of lung re-expansion).\n- Drainage is minimal.\n- Medical assessment has determined that the lung has reinflated.\n- There is no evidence of respiratory compromise.\n- A chest X-ray (if available) shows lung expansion.\n\n【217】 #Clamping before removal of chest drain\nIf the patient had a haemothorax, there is no need to clamp the chest tube before removal.\n\n【218】 #Clamping trial:\nThe surgeon will clamp the chest tube above the bottle for six hours. (This must be done in the morning.)\nDuring this time the nurse must closely observe the patient for any signs of respiratory distress, as this could indicate that the patient may have developed a tension pneumothorax. If the patient develops any difficulty breathing, etc. call the surgeon.\nAfter the chest tube has been clamped for six hours, the surgeon should unclamp the drain and check the drain for any bubbling:\n- If there is no bubbling, the drain is safe to remove.\n- If there is a lot of bubbling, the patient may have a bronchopleural fistula, and the surgeon will decide whether the patient needs surgery.\nEquipment needed Before removal: Check whether the surgeon requires a clamping trial. If so, the clamp will be applied by the surgeon for six hours and then reviewed and removed by the surgeon.\n\n【219】 #PROCEDURE FOR REMOVING A CHEST DRAIN PROCEDURE FOR REMOVING A CHEST DRAIN\n21. Wash your hands with soap and water.\n22. Document the removal in the patient notes and on the drain chart.\n23. Monitor the patient's vital signs and the drain site.\n24. The dressing should remain intact for 48 hours.\nA chest X-ray should be done 12 to 24 hours post-removal, if available.\n\n【220】 #OBJECTIVE\nTo ensure the nurse is capable of providing high-quality care to a patient with a POP cast.\n\n【221】 #INDICATIONS\n- Upper limbs: Fractured forearm or hand or fractured humerus with a sling - Lower limbs: Fractured tibia, ankle or foot\n\n【222】 #CONTRAINDICATIONS\n- Fractured femur\n\n【223】 #GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF POP APPLICATION\nIt is usually the surgeon or physiotherapist who will apply the POP cast. The nurse can also apply a POP cast with the appropriate training. The surgeon must always check the cast once it has been applied.\n- Never put POP directly on unprotected skin.\n- The edges of the cast must be covered and not chafe, or rub on, the skin.\n\n【224】 - Clean the skin after application - Check the position of limb.\n- Areas not to be compressed include the fracture site, nerves, vessels, wounds and bony prominences.\n\n【225】 #COMPLICATIONS\nThe following complications can occur for patients with POP casts:\n- pressure injuries - abrasions - wound infections - nerve compromise (if the cast is too tight)\n- contact dermatitis.\n\n【226】 #NURSING CARE\nIn order to prevent the above complications, the following should be done by the nurse:\n\n【227】 #Pain management\n- Ensure analgesia is given as required, especially before applying the cast.\nWound care\n- Check for signs of infection if there is a wound - Ensure any skin lesions or wounds are cleansed and repaired or dressed before applying POP.\n- If there is a wound that needs a regular change of dressing, ensure a window is cut in the cast around the wound by a physiotherapist or surgeon.\n- Ensure there is sufficient padding on bony prominences.\n\n【228】 #Mobilization\n- Make sure the cast is the correct size and shape.\n- Elevate the affected limb to decrease swelling and pain.\n\n【229】 - The patient must not bear weight on the cast until permitted by the surgeon.\n- It is usually the role of the physiotherapist to oversee the mobilization of patients with POP casts.\n\n【230】 #Care of POP\n- Ensure the cast stays dry.\n- The skin under the cast can become itchy -discourage the patient from inserting objects under the cast to relieve itching.\n- Check for crumbling or weakening of the cast and report any issues.\n\n【231】 #Observations\n- After application, evaluate the neurovascular status of the affected limb every hour for the first four hours.\n- Then make neurovascular observations each shift.\n- Neurovascular observations include colour, warmth, movement, sensation and distal pulses.\n\n【232】 #SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS\nTell the surgeon if the patient develops the following:\n- severe or increasing pain - numbness or tingling in the fingers or toes - bluish or dusky skin - cracks or breaks in the POP - wet, crumbling or weakened POP.\n\n【233】 #ICRC NURSING GUIDELINE 21 CARING FOR A PATIENT IN TRACTION OVERVIEW\nTraction is a set of mechanisms used for straightening broken bones or relieving pressure on the skeletal system. It involves the application of a pulling force to a limb while a counter-force pulls in the opposite direction, therefore enabling a fracture to be held in alignment. A patient usually remains in traction for six weeks or more.\nTraction is used to:\n\n【234】 There are two main types of traction, skin traction and skeletal traction.\nSkin traction: A pulling force is applied to the skin and soft tissues of a limb using adhesive tape or strapping.\n\n【235】 #Indications\n- Infants, children or the elderly, who require a small amount of traction - Fractured femur in adolescents\nFor infants under 15 kg, skin traction is applied as so-called gallows traction, where both legs are hung above the patient with 90 degrees of hip flexion.\n\n【236】 #Skeletal traction:\nA pin is placed into a bone, and weights are attached to pull the bone into place.\n\n【237】 #Indications:\n- Fractured femur - Fractured distal humerus around the elbow - Fractured tibia\n\n【238】 #OBJECTIVE\nTo ensure the nurse is capable of providing high-quality care to a patient in traction.\n\n【239】 #NURSING CARE\nTraction care\n- The surgeon or physiotherapist will prepare the bed with a Braun frame and the appropriate weights.\n- Ensure the end of the bed is elevated on wooden blocks for counter-traction.\n- Ensure the line of traction pull is maintained.\n- Do not alter the position of traction or alignment without asking the surgeon.\n\n【240】 #Maintain skin integrity\nAs a patient in traction is on bed rest, they are at risk of developing pressure injuries. Therefore, the nurse should undertake the following:\n- Keep the bed sheets wrinkle-free, clean and dry.\n- Examine the patient's skin and especially bony prominences every two to four hours for any breaks or reddened areas.\n- Use pressure-relieving devices under bony prominences or areas of particular pressure.\n- Ensure the patient is correctly positioned.\n- Carry out regular pressure area care every two to four hours.\n- Document the condition of patient's skin in the patient notes.\n\n【241】 #Observations\n- Take the patient's vital signs once daily, or more often if indicated.\n- Four times a day, make neurovascular observations: check the affected limb for swelling, numbness, sensation, pain, temperature or change in colour.\n- For patients in skin traction, check that the bandage is not too tight.\n\n【242】 - Ensure the limb is correctly positioned.\n\n【243】 #Pin sites\n\n【244】 - Monitor the pin site for signs of infection\n\n【245】 #Pain management\n- Assess the patient's pain score daily.\n- Give analgesia as prescribed.\n\n【246】 #Nutrition and hygiene\n- Ensure the patient has an assisted daily wash. Enlist the help of carers if possible.\n- Assist the patient with toileting needs. Provide bed pan or urinal as needed.\n- Monitor the patient's urine output. Ensure the patient does not go into retention or develop a urinary infection - Ensure the patient is drinking enough water.\n- Give regular aperients to prevent constipation.\n\n【247】 #Activity\nAs the patient will be on bed rest for many weeks, they may become very bored and/or depressed. Try to prevent this by:\n- moving the bed outside each day so that the patient gets fresh air and a change of scenery - referring the patient to mental-health staff/a counsellor if needed\n- arranging activities for them, providing colouring books, movies, books, board games, etc.\n- ensuring the patient has visitors (family, friends, community members).\n\n【248】 #SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS\n- Traction patients need regular X-rays: An X-ray must be taken preoperatively and 24 hours post-op.\nThereafter, X-rays must be taken once weekly for three weeks and then once monthly until traction is removed, or if any significant changes occur.\n- Ensure the patient has regular physiotherapy.\n- If there are any signs of change in neurovascular status, report them to the surgeon immediately.\n\n【249】 #LINKS\nAn SCI can be classified as complete or incomplete.\n- A complete SCI entails loss of all motor and sensory function below the level of the injury.\nFractures of the spine can be either stable or unstable:\n- A stable fracture occurs when spinal alignment is intact and there is no risk of further damage.\nIt can usually be treated with a brace and rest.\n- An unstable fracture risks resulting in an SCI.\nParalysis is the inability to move limbs and muscles and to feel sensations. Spinal cord injuries result in some degree of paralysis; paralyzed patients are classified as paraplegic, quadriplegic or hemiplegic.\n- Paraplegia: Paralysis of both legs with or without bladder/bowel involvement - Quadriplegia (tetraplegia): Loss of function below the neck with or without respiratory involvement - Hemiplegia: Paralysis of one side of the body, occurs opposite to side of brain lesion/injury\n\n【250】 #OBJECTIVE\nTo ensure the nurse is capable in providing high-quality care to a patient with an SCI and preventing further complications.\n\n【251】 #CAUSES OF A SCI\n- Trauma, e.g. a fall or other accident - Medical conditions, e.g. spina bifida, polio, myelitis - Degenerative conditions, e.g. osteoporosis - Hematoma - Infections - Tumours\n\n【252】 #CLINICAL PRESENTATION\nThe clinical presentation of paralysis depends on the location of injury. In a complete SCI, the patient will have loss of all movement and sensation below the level of injury/lesion.\nSymptoms may include:\n- back pain that radiates\n- limb weakness - difficulty walking or moving - loss of reflexes below the level of injury - loss of sensation below the level of injury - cessation of sweating - sexual impairment - bladder/bowel dysfunction.\n\n【253】 #ASSESSMENT\nConsider an SCI if an injured patient comes to the emergency room or ward complaining of spinal pain, weakness or loss of sensation or has a head injury or decreased consciousness.\nThe first priority is to assess the injury and stabilize the patient.\nA primary survey (ABCDE) and full head-to-toe examination must be carried out by the team, including the doctor, physiotherapist and nurse.\n\n【254】 #Airway and cervical-spine protection Airway\n- Assess and secure the airway.\n- For a C1 to C4 injury, the patient may need ventilation via intubation or tracheostomy.\n\n【255】 #Cervical spine protection\n- First immobilize the entire spine if an SCI is known or suspected.\n- Apply a cervical-spine (neck) collar and keep the patient's head in a neutral position. Ensure the collar is strapped and taped down, and instruct the patient not to move.\n- If you must move the patient, the log-roll method must be carried out by a trained team in order to maintain spinal alignment.\n- The patient may need cervical traction or non-invasive traction or splints.\n- In cases where the SCI can be reversed or stabilized, early surgery may be indicated.\n\n【256】 #Breathing\n- Assess the patient's breathing.\n- Assist the patient with ventilation if required.\n- Give oxygen to correct hypoxia if prescribed.\n\n【257】 #Circulation\n- Check the patient's blood pressure and heart rate. Bradycardia and hypotension are common.\n- Note: Depending on the level and nature of SCI, the patient may have no pain sensation, meaning that early warning signs of ischaemia, intra-abdominal injury (including haemorrhage), etc. will not be present.\n\n【258】 #Disability\n- Perform a neurological exam.\n- Asses the patient's level of consciousness with the Glasgow Coma Scale/AVPU scale (alert, verbal, pain, unresponsive).\n- Assess the patient's pupil response.\n- This should be carried out hourly in first 24 hours then every four hours thereafter.\n\n【259】 #Exposure\n- Check for other injuries.\n- Keep the patient's temperature within a normal range.\n- Hypothermia is common, so this should be corrected.\nOrganize a CT/X-ray/MRI, depending on what is available.\n\n【260】 #MANAGEMENT\nManaging a patient with an SCI can be intensive and often beyond the scope, and therefore the admission criteria, of an ICRC hospital project in a very low-resource environment with compromised infrastructure and few trained staff members.\nInitially the patient will need to be nursed in the high-dependency unit or intensive care unit; once stable, they can be managed on the ward. Management should involve the whole team, including close work with the physiotherapist and mental health and psychosocial support staff.\n\n【261】 #Hygiene\n- The patient will need a daily wash or bed bath.\n- Keep the patient clean and dry.\n- Ensure their bed sheets are clean and dry.\n- Attend to mouth care.\n- Enlisting the supervised assistance of a carer or relative in the above can be very beneficial for the patient and alleviate the workload of the staff.\n\n【262】 #Elimination\n- Bladder: Insert a urinary catheter (as per Guideline 17). Monitor and record urine output.\n- Bowel: Give laxatives and enemas as required. Give the patient a high-fibre diet and encourage fluids.\n- Strictly maintain a fluid-balance chart and bowel chart.\n- Assist the patient with bedpans/urinals, if needed.\n- Provide sanitary pads, if needed.\n\n【263】 #Pressure area care\nPatients with SCIs are at a very high risk of developing pressure sores owing to a loss of sensation and an inability to move and reposition themselves.\n- Assess skin integrity every two hours during the pressure area turns.\n- Provide pressure area care every two hours.\n- Put the patient on a pressure-relieving mattress, if available.\n- Use pillows and padding where possible - Liaise with the physiotherapist.\n\n【264】 #Nutrition\n- Check the patient's swallowing reflex.\n- Initially the patient may need a nasogastric tube to decrease the risk of aspiration and vomiting owing to a paralytic ileus.\n- Once the doctor determines the patient can eat safely, feeding can be restarted.\n- A high-protein, high-calorie, high-fibre diet is required.\n- Encourage patient to eat and drink.\n- Assist with feeding.\n- Involve a caretaker to help the patient.\n\n【265】 #Prevention of contractures\n- The patient will have abnormal muscle tone and a lack of movement, which may result in contractures.\n- Involve the physiotherapist to help the patient into a good position.\n- The physiotherapist will do passive exercises with the patient.\n\n【266】 #Moving the patient\n- Together with the physiotherapist, use a minimum of two trained nurses to turn the patient.\n- Log-roll patient when needed.\n- Use a wheelchair once the patient is stable - Use bed frames or slide sheets, if available.\n\n【267】 #Mental health and psychosocial support\n- Refer the patient to the counsellor - Be aware that depression and denial are common.\n- Discuss the patient's injury and outcomes with them and their family.\n- Give them time to ask questions. Be supportive, patient and sensitive.\n- Provide them with as much information as possible.\n- Encourage family and community support.\n- Refer them to any community services that may be available.\n\n【268】 #Rehabilitation\n- The patient will need intensive rehabilitation.\n- The physiotherapist will refer them to a physical-rehabilitation programme, if available.\n- Encourage the patient's independence and family involvement in their care.\n\n【269】 #OBJECTIVE\nTo ensure the nurse is able to safely insert an NGT and provide high-quality care to a patient with an NGT, including administering feeds and medications via an NGT in a safe and appropriate manner.\n\n【270】 #INDICATIONS\n- 1. Explain the procedure to the patient and get their consent.\n2. Help the patient to sit upright, and position a pillow behind their head.\n3. Measure the distance from the earlobe to the bridge of the nose to the xiphisternum, then mark the length on the tube indicating the correct length needed to reach the stomach.\n4. Set up the trolley with all of your equipment.\n5. Wash your hands with soap and water.\n6. Put on gloves and an apron.\n\n【271】 #PROCEDURE\n1. Check that the patient's nostrils are clear.\n2. Apply lubricating jelly to the tip of the NGT.\n3. Insert the end of the tube into the nostril and advance it horizontally. If there is resistance, withdraw the tube and try the other nostril.\n4. As the tube passes, ask the patient to try to swallow. It may help to give them sips of water. Ensure they stay calm and still. Offer reassurance that the discomfort is temporary, and encourage them to breathe normally.\n5. Once the tube has been inserted to the marked point, tape it to the side of the patient's nose to secure it.\n6. Aspirate 10 ml from the NGT.\n7. Attach the tube to a drainage bag.\n\n【272】 #POST-PROCEDURE\n1. Perform a pH test (if available) or a chest X-ray to check the NGT is in the right position in the stomach.\n\n【273】 #NURSING CARE\nAfter the insertion of an NGT, it is important to check that it is in the right position. This can be done by X-ray or by checking the pH of the aspirate.\nChecking pH:\n- Attach a 10 ml syringe to the end of the NGT and withdraw 1 ml of aspirate.\n- Apply the aspirate to a pH indicator strip.\n- The pH should be between pH 0 and pH 5.\nPrior to using an NGT, the nurse must ensure it is in the correct position. Coughing, vomiting and other movement could displace the tube from the correct position.\n- the tape is secure - the position of the marker on the NGT is the same as when the NGT was inserted.\n\n【274】 #Medication administration\n- Unless you are specifically requested to do so by the doctor, do not give medication through the NGT if it is for free drainage or used to aspirate the stomach.\n- Always check the position of the NGT before giving medications.\n- Flush the NGT with 20 to 50 ml of sterile water before and after use to ensure patency.\n- Sit the patient in an upright position and ensure they remain sitting upright for 30 minutes after medications are administered.\n- Mix medications with sterile water until they are fully dissolved.\n- Never crush enteric-coated medicines.\n- Give medication through the NGT slowly. Never force it. If there is a blockage that cannot be alleviated by gentle aspiration, inform the doctor. The tube may need to be changed.\n\n【275】 #NGT feeding\n- Sit the patient upright and ensure they sit upright 30 minutes after the feeding.\n- Flush the tube, using a plunger or gravity, with 20 to 50 ml of sterile water before the feeding.\n- Fill a 50 ml syringe with the formula.\n- Attach the syringe to the end of the NGT and hold it upright. Let the formula drip slowly down through tube.\n- Once the feeding is finished, flush the NGT with 50 ml of sterile water.\n\n【276】 #PROCEDURE FOR REMOVING AN NGT\n1. Explain the procedure and get the patient's consent.\n2. Sit the patient upright.\n3. Set up the trolley with your equipment.\n4. Wash your hands with soap and water and put on gloves.\n5. Remove the tape that secures the tube.\n6. Disconnect it from the drainage bag and clamp the end of the tube.\n7. Gently pull the NGT so it slides out of the patient's nose.\n\n【277】 #CARING FOR A PATIENT RECEIVING A BLOOD TRANSFUSION OVERVIEW\nA blood transfusion is \"the administration of a blood component-or plasma-derived product to a patient\". 4 It can be a lifesaving intervention.\nSupplies of blood in the field are usually extremely limited; therefore, all efforts should be made to minimize blood loss. The ICRC most commonly uses whole blood. Sometimes, we have a field hospital blood bank or rely on an external blood bank. In other cases, patients' family members or so-called walking blood banks donate blood\n\n【278】 #Indications for red blood cell transfusion\n- Severe anaemia - Anaemia, for patients with decompensation - Disseminated intravascular coagulopathy NB Anaemia can be due to nutritional deficiencies, blood loss, kidney disease, medications or chronic disease.\n\n【279】 #Indications for plasma transfusion\n- Thrombocytopenia - Platelet function defects\n\n【280】 #Who should receive transfusions?\nThe decision to transfuse blood products is a clinical choice made by the doctor based on the compared risks and benefits. The ICRC follows the World Health Organization's guidelines, which suggest the following:\n- A healthy adult with chronic anaemia should receive a transfusion if their haemoglobin level is under 5 g/dl.\n\n【281】 #OBJECTIVE\nTo ensure the nurse can provide high-quality care to a patient receiving a blood transfusion by safely delivering blood products to the patient and by recognizing and treating early signs of blood-transfusion reactions.\n\n【282】 #BLOOD GROUPS\nA blood group is an inherited trait, determined by the presence of antigens on the red cell membrane. The main blood group system is the ABO system. The ABO system is defined by the presence of antigen A and/or B on the surface of red blood cells. There are four main blood types: O, A, B and AB. The Rh(D) antigen may or may not be present; red cells with the antigen are Rh(D) positive (denoted by a \"+\" after their blood type)\nand those without it are Rh(D) negative (denoted by a \"-\" sign). 1. The doctor orders blood on a blood request form.\n\n【283】 #BLOOD COMPATIBILITY BLOOD TYPE CAN GIVE BLOOD TO\n2\n3. Before being given to a patient, all blood must be tested for compatibility, HIV, hepatis B and C, syphilis, malaria and Rhesus antibodies.\nWhen the blood is ready, the nurse should go to the lab and collect it.\n5. Inspect the blood bag for any abnormalities. The tube and bag should be intact with no leaks, clots or damage.\nThe blood product should be right colour -red cells are dark red, and plasma is bright yellow. The expiry date must be checked.\n6. Two nurses should perform checks at the patient's bedside, checking that the patient's name, date of birth and blood type match the prescription and blood bag. Also check that the number on the bag matches that on the prescription form.\n7. Complete baseline observations.\n8. Check that patient has a working cannula.\n9. Prepare the blood transfusion set. Connect the blood to the giving set, and prime the line using aseptic technique.\n10. The infusion rate should be calculated, and blood must be given within 30 minutes of being collected from the lab.\n\n【284】 #DURING TRANSFUSION\n11. Connect the blood to the cannula and start giving the blood.\n12. Stay with the patient for the first 15 minutes as they are receiving the blood to watch for any abnormal signs, such as a fever, chills, a rash, flushing, difficulty breathing anxiety.\n13. If the patient develops any signs or their condition worsens, stop the blood and call for help.\n14. Vital signs must be monitored at the following intervals:\n-five minutes after commencing -every 15 minutes for the first hour -every 30 minutes thereafter until completion -30 minutes after completion -four to six hours later.\n15. If the patient's temperature goes above 38°C or rises by 1 to 2°C, stop the blood and call the doctor.\n16. If the patient has a urinary catheter in situ, monitor their hourly urine output. For adults, it should be 30 to 60 ml per hour and for children 1 ml/kg per hour.\n\n【285】 #Blood transfusion times:\n- Adults should be completed in two hours.\n- Children should be completed in three hours, usually at a rate of 5 ml/kg/hr for packed red blood cells.\n- A transfusion should never go longer than four hours, as this increases the risk of bacterial contamination.\n\n【286】 #AFTER TRANSFUSION\n17. Check the patient's vital signs 30 minutes after the transfusion is complete and then four to six hours after that. 18. Record the finish time on the transfusion chart.\n19. Flush with 100 ml of 0.9% saline.\n20. Remove the cross-match label from the blood bag and stick it in the patient notes.\n21. Document the blood transfusion and any signs of a reaction in the notes.\n22. Return any unused blood to the lab and dispose of waste in the clinical-waste bin.\n23. Check the patient's haemoglobin level the following day and control it.\n\n【287】 #TRANSFUSION-RELATED COMPLICATIONS\nIt is important to monitor the patient for any reactions to the transfusion; these are abnormal signs or symptoms that occur during or after the transfusion.\n\n【288】 #OBJECTIVE\nTo ensure the nurse is able to provide high-quality care to an unconscious patient.\n\n【289】 #ASSESSMENT\nA general assessment should be carried out for a patient with an altered level of consciousness, including:\n- taking their vital signs - thoroughly examining their breathing pattern - testing blood gases (if available)\n- thoroughly examining their skin, looking for bruises, a rash, raccoon eyes, Battle's sign, jaundice, sweat, etc.\n- performing a head-to-toe examination - obtaining a history.\nA neurological examination should also be conducted, assessing the patient's level of consciousness, motor responses and brainstem reflexes.\n\n【290】 #Obtaining a history\nA patient with a decreased level of consciousness probably cannot give a history of what happened, so it is useful to try to obtain a history from a witness, relative or friend. The patient's personal belongings may also give a clue to their condition -the presence of medication, a medic-alert bracelet, etc.\nAsk the witness, relative or friend the following questions:\n- What time did the change in consciousness occur?\n- Was it sudden or gradual?\n- What happened beforehand, e.g. a seizure, collapse, injury?\n- Has something like this happened before?\n- Has the patient had any recent illness/infections or falls?\n- Have there been any recent change in behaviour?\n- What do you know about the patient's medications/allergies/previous medical history?\n\n【291】 #Assessing consciousness level\nThe patient's level of consciousness is the most sensitive indicator of neurological deterioration and the most important part of the examination.\n\n【292】 #Glasgow Coma Scale\nThe Glasgow Coma Scale assesses the consciousness level of patients with head injuries. It looks at three different behaviours: eye opening, verbal response and motor response. Each behaviour is scored according to the stimulus that provokes it. The total score is out of 15.\n\n【293】 #AVPU scale\nUsing the AVPU scale is another way to assess consciousness. It is simple to use, rapid and effective. It can be used for acutely unwell patients and for children.\n\n【294】 #It stands for:\nalert: The patient is alert\nVoice: The patient responds to your voice.\npain: The patient responds to pain unresponsive: The patient is unresponsive.\n\n【295】 #Pupil activity\nThe patient's pupils should also be examined by shining a torch into both eyes at separate times. Check whether the pupils respond to light, whether they are equal or unequal and what size they are.\n\n【296】 #Motor function\nCheck the patient's muscle strength, muscle coordination and reflexes, and look for abnormal movements.\nYou can do this by asking them to squeeze your hand with each of their hands and to raise their legs or push with their feet against your hand.\n\n【297】 #MANAGEMENT\nCaring for an unconscious patient is challenging and time-consuming. They will need to be nursed in an intensive care unit or high-dependency unit, where a higher level of care and constant nursing supervision can be assured. The nurse should pay particular attention to the following:\n\n【298】 #Airway\n- Keep the airway clear.\n- The patient might be ventilated or have a tracheostomy.\n- Suction may be required. Ensure a machine is available.\n- Oxygen will be required. Ensure there is a constant oxygen supply and the appropriate consumables are available.\n\n【299】 #Observations\n- Vital signs must be taken regularly -in the acute stage, every 30 minutes then reduced to every one or two hours, depending on the condition of the patient and in consultation with the doctor.\n- The patient's Glasgow Coma Scale score and pupils should be checked regularly.\n- Use the high-dependency unit monitoring chart .\n\n【300】 #Fluid/nutrition\n- The patient must receive nothing by mouth (nil per os/NPO). Ensure an NPO sign is clearly displayed by the bed.\n- Intravenous fluids will be required. Ensure an adequate supply is provided.\n- Nasogastric or percutaneous endoscopic gastronomy (PEG) tube feeding may be required. Check with the doctor.\n- Ensure all fluid intake and output is recorded.\n\n【301】 #Hygiene\n- The patient will need a daily wash/bed bath.\n- The patient's skin condition must be assessed and the skin kept clean and dry.\n- Attend to mouth care every two hours.\n- Ensure a urinary catheter is in situ and catheter care is provided.\n- Maintain a fluid-balance chart.\n- Monitor the patient's bowel movements and prevent constipation with aperients.\n- Keep the patient's skin moisturized.\n\n【302】 #Pressure-area care\n- Provide pressure-area care every two hours, changing the patient's position.\n- Support their limbs with cushions/pillows.\n- Involve the physiotherapist.\n- Keep the bed clean and dry.\n\n【303】 #Physiotherapy\n- The physiotherapist will need to perform chest and limb physiotherapy to prevent chest infections, contractures and limb wasting.\n- Passive exercises should be performed every two hours.\n- The patient's limbs should be massaged.\n\n【304】 #Mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS)\nMHPSS services should be used to support the patient's family/caretaker. In a high-income setting, an intensive care unit (ICU) is a specialized department within a hospital that provides intensive treatment, caring for patients with severe and life-threatening injuries or conditions requiring constant and close monitoring. An ICU requires specialized, sophisticated and sensitive equipment, a wide range of drugs, sophisticated diagnostics and laboratory support, and fully trained specialist staff members.\n\n【305】 #LINKS\nConditions such as trauma, severe sepsis and organ failure can be treated in an ICU.\nAn HDU also exists in high-income settings and is designed as a step down from the ICU, providing close monitoring, specialized care and supervision to patients who are too sick for a general ward but not sick enough for an ICU. The patients can be stabilized in the HDU until they are ready for the ward.\nCurrently, it is beyond the resources and scope of the ICRC to provide ICU care owing to the nature of the low-income, low-resource areas where hospital projects are situated. Instead, the ICRC offers HDU care to critically ill patients requiring close monitoring.\nOften the ICRC hospital team will set up an HDU of sorts, which can be a stand-alone unit or a closed-off area on the ward or in the recovery or emergency rooms. In order to ensure the correct functioning of the HDU, suction, oxygen and a pulse oximeter are required (at a minimum). The area should be connected to a generator to ensure 24-hour electricity supply and should also have easy access to running water and a waste-management area. The ICRC does not promote the use of ventilators in the HDU owing to the lack both of infrastructure to support mechanical ventilators and of trained staff, including biomedical engineers, to ensure their safe use Those who may need to be admitted to the HDU include patients with the following:\n- major/complex surgery - major trauma - complicated maxillofacial cases - tracheostomies in the first 24 hours - cerebral malaria - severe sepsis - major burns - severe head injuries.\n\n【306】 #OBJECTIVE\nTo ensure the nurse is able to provide high-quality nursing care to critically ill patients in the HDU.\n\n【307】 #ASSESSMENT\nIn order to set up an HDU it is important to make a needs-based assessment of the staff and the environment.\n\n【308】 #Assess the staff\nIt is important to establish what staff you are working with and who is suitable for and capable of working in an HDU. Ask the following:\n- What training or experience do the staff have?\n- What is their motivation level?\n- Are they tired?\n- What shifts do they work?\n- Is there a doctor available?\n- Are there enough staff members to have a ratio of one nurse and one nursing assistant to every six patients (depending on acuity)?\n\n【309】 #Assess the environment\n- What are the local capabilities and expectations?\n- Is there a constant power source?\n- Is the equipment working?\nAssess the culture\n- Is ventilation accepted?\n- Are resuscitation and/or intubation accepted?\nTransfer capabilities\n- Can the patient be transferred elsewhere?\n- How far away is the referral facility?\n- Has the family consented to transferring the patient?\n\n【310】 #MANAGEMENT\nPatients in the HDU will require excellent nursing care. There should be one nurse and one nursing assistant caring for every six patients, and a doctor should be available when required. HDU care requires the following:\nClose monitoring\n- Frequent vital signs and Glasgow Coma Scale score - Constant pulse oximetry - Regular primary surveys (ABCDE) to monitor any change in the patient's condition -A -Is the airway open, safe and managed by the patient independently or do you need to assist the airway?\n-B -Is breathing effective, are the oxygen saturation levels acceptable, or does the patient need oxygen support?\n-C -Check the patient's pulse, blood pressure, colour, capillary refill, and bleeding/dressing. If any is abnormal, treat the patient and call for help.\n-D -How conscious is the patient? Check their AVPU (Alert, Voice, Pain, Unresponsive) or Glasgow Coma Scale score.\n-E -Monitor the patient's temperature, and keep them warm.\n\n【311】 #Pain management\n- Regularly take the patient's pain score.\n- Give regular analgesia.\n\n【312】 #Fluid balance\nWhen a patient is critically ill, it is important to know their hydration status -what is going in and coming out. If they are unwell they may need fluid supplements. It is important to ensure the patient does not become hypovolaemic or overloaded. Hence, a fluid-balance chart needs to be kept strictly.\n\n【313】 #The chart should include:\n- what is eaten/drunk - intravenous fluids or medications given - any blood loss - vomiting - faeces/stoma output - nasogastric tube loss - urine output, including colour and volume.\nFluid loss in the body can cause damage to the heart and kidneys, and if these organs do not function properly the patient can become even more unwell.\n\n【314】 #Documentation\nIt is absolutely essential to document the condition of the patient regularly in order to rapidly identify any deterioration. Documentation in the HDU should be done using the HDU chart .\nThe following need to be accurately documented:\n- vital signs - fluid balance - change in condition - all nursing actions - when the patient is reviewed by the doctor.\nRemember: If it has not been documented, it was not done\n\n【315】 #Setting up an HDU\nIn order to set up an HDU, the following is necessary:\n- one to two bays or a small area to accommodate two full bed spaces with enough room to fully move around the beds\n- wheeled beds that can be elevated - a cupboard to store equipment and supplies - a working area/desk for the nurse - an area to prepare drugs and procedures - a washbasin to wash hands - an oxygen concentrator and a spare - oxygen masks, tubing, a bag-valve mask, etc.\n- nebulizers - a suction machine and suction equipment - a tracheostomy tray\n- a chest drain tray - vital sign equipment -pulse oximeter, sphygmomanometer - drip stands - a HemoCue - vascular-access equipment - all documentation charts.\n\n【316】 #A. Airway obstruction\nAn airway obstruction is a blockage in any part of the airway which may partially or fully prevent air getting to the lungs. It can occur at the mouth, throat, larynx, trachea or bronchus.\n\n【317】 #Examination\nIs the patient able to speak? Cough? Breathe?\nLook in the patient's mouth for blood, secretions or loose teeth and look for respirations, movement of the chest and the colour of the patient Listen for stridor, inspirations, expirations or snoring.\nfeel for movement of the chest or warm air going in or out of the nose or mouth.\n\n【318】 #Management\nIs the patient conscious or rousable? Is their breathing effective? Can you sit them up and get them to breathe deeply? If not:\n- check their mouth - prepare an airway adjunct - prepare to perform a head-tilt/chin-lift - suction the oral cavity.\nIf the patient's Glasgow Coma Scale score is reduced, you may need to safeguard the airway by doing one or more of the following:\n- performing a head-tilt/chin-lift.\n- putting the patient in the recovery position.\n- ventilating the patient with a bag-valve mask.\n- intubating the patient (the doctor must decide).\n- inserting a nasopharyngeal airway (NPA). Do not use an NPA if the patient has facial or head trauma;\nNPAs are only for conscious patients with a pharyngeal reflex. Put the patient's head in a neutral position, and insert the NPA into the nostril back and downwards.\nIf the patient starts talking or swallowing, you can remove it.\n\n【319】 #Management\n- Give oxygen.\n- Insert a chest drain if needed - Give the patient mechanical ventilation with a bag-valve mask if needed.\n- Reposition the patient to maximize their breathing.\n- Give medications to help open the patient's airway.\n\n【320】 #Circulatory problems Causes\n- - Give intravenous fluids or blood as prescribed.\n- Take blood for haemoglobin levels and cross-match.\n- Do an electrocardiogram if available.\n- Give cardiac medications as prescribed, if available.\n\n【321】 #Decreased consciousness Causes\n- Hypoxia - Hypercapnia (increased carbon dioxide)\n- Cerebral hypoperfusion - Sedation - Low blood sugar - Trauma - Alcohol - Stroke\n\n【322】 #Management\n- Protect the patient's airway.\n- Treat the cause - Check the patient's blood sugar\n- Check the patient's history -medications, allergies and previous medical history.\n- Nurse the patient in the recovery position if appropriate.\n\n【323】 #Exposure (temperature control)\n- Expose the patient and examine them from head to toe.\n- Give the patient blankets.\n- Remove wet or soaked clothes or linens.\n\n【324】 #SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS\nto a variety of constraints beyond the control of the hospital team, a physiotherapist is not always present.\n\n【325】 #LINKS\nIn the absence of physiotherapy services, the surgical team must be able to offer basic physiotherapy services to prevent unnecessary complications and promote good rehabilitation.\nPhysiotherapy after surgery provides a number of benefits, leading to a faster recovery and improved physical and mental health for the patient. Physiotherapy:\n- encourages and promotes healing - helps the patient retain muscle and prevents muscle wasting - minimizes scar tissue - helps the patient regain mobility and strength.\n\n【326】 #OBJECTIVE\nTo ensure the nurse is able to provide high-quality basic physiotherapy activities when there is no physiotherapist available in order to prevent further disability and promote good recovery.\n\n【327】 #MANAGEMENT\n\n【328】 #OUTCOME ACTIVITIES\nPreventing chest infections -Encourage early mobilization.\n-Encourage deep-breathing exercises and use of incentive spirometer.\n-Sit patient up when they are able.\nPreventing pressure injuries -Ensure regular repositioning and use of pillows or limb-elevation devices.\n-Elevate the affected limb.\n-Encourage muscle activity.\nManaging patients in traction -Ensure the limb is correctly aligned on the frame.\nTreating patients in plaster of Paris casts -Ensure the cast is not too tight.\n-Keep the affected body part elevated as required.\n\n【329】 #OUTCOME ACTIVITIES\nTreating patients with spinal cord injuries -Reposition the patient every two hours.\n-Start transfers as soon as the patient is stable.\nMobilizing patients -Encourage early mobilization and assist with crutches, wheelchair, etc.\n\n【330】 #SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS\nThese interventions should only be carried out under prescription and under the supervision of the head nurse or head surgeon\n\n【331】 #LINKS\nThe ICRC's physiotherapy team in Geneva has created general cards that a nurse can use when a physiotherapy service is not available. Follow the cards according to the type of intervention or the patient's condition\nThe cards include guidelines on:\n\n【332】 #OBJECTIVE\nTo ensure the nurse is able to provide high-quality care to dehydrated patients by assessing their hydration status and preventing or treating dehydration.\n\n【333】 #EVALUATING DEHYDRATION\nTo determine whether a patient is dehydrated, measure the patient's urine output; if output is low, the patient is dehydrated. Note, however, that their level of dehydration cannot be measured using this method.\n\n【334】 #AGE ADEQUATE URINE OUTPUT\n10 yr 0.5-1 ml/kg/hr  5 In adults, standard ORS could cause heart failure owing to the excess of sodium relative to potassium. ReSoMal (rehydration solution for malnutrition) is recommended in such cases because it has a high potassium content relative to sodium and is thus thought to be safer.\nThe aim of treatment is to stop fluid loss and replace lost fluids, bringing the patient to a state of homeostasis.\nTreatment of mild to moderate dehydration is the administration of oral rehydration salts (ORS) and close monitoring of vital signs until the symptoms are alleviated.\nThe WHO recommends that ORS be made of 75 mEq of sodium per litre and 75 mmol of glucose.\nNote: In adult patients with cholera, simple diarrhea or uncomplicated acute malnutrition, standard ORS should be used. In complicated acute malnutrition and all other situations, a tailored protocol needs to be defined by the doctor or nutritionist. 5\n\n【335】 #Adults\n- Some dehydration (mild to moderate, or 5 to 10% dehydration): Give 2.2 to 4 l of ORS in the first four hours. Then reassess in six hours.\n- Severe dehydration (10% dehydration or above): Insert an intravenous (IV) cannula and give fluid stat, 30 ml/kg in the first 30 minutes. Then give 70 ml/kg of Ringer's lactate over three hours. Use Ringer's lactate or Ringer's lactate with 5% dextrose. If both are unavailable, normal saline can be used.\n\n【336】 #Children\n- Some dehydration (mild to moderate, or 5 to 10% dehydration): The child will need ORS supplementation in a supervised setting, using the amounts below as recommended by the WHO.\nIf the child's weight is known, you can give 100 ml/kg of ORS in the first four hours. The child must be observed closely until all signs of dehydration are gone and the child has passed urine. - Severe dehydration (10% dehydration or above): The child will need to be hospitalized and given IV fluids .\nThe WHO recommends the below for children with severe dehydration in a resource-limited setting:\n-Once the child can drink, give them ORS.\n-Revaluate the child after a few hours, and treat them according to their hydration status.\n-If the child has seizures, you can give a rapid bolus with glucose.\n-If the child has severe malnutrition, only give IV fluids if they are in overt shock . There is risk of causing fluid overload in severely malnourished children when you give IV hydration.\n\n【337】 #IV FLUIDS FOR SEVERELY DEHYDRATED CHILDREN\n1. Give a bolus of isotonic crystalloid: 30 ml/kg over 30 min. Give over 1 hr for children under one year old.\nYou can use Ringer's lactate or normal saline.\n2. Follow by giving 70 ml/kg of isotonic crystalloid over 2.5 hr. Give over 5 hr for children under one year old.\n3. If there is no improvement in 1 to 2 hr, increase the speed.\n4. Once finished, repeat if the child's radial pulse is weak or absent.\n\n【338】 #NURSING CARE\n- If the patient has diarrhoea, send a stool specimen.\n- For babies, encourage the mother to continue breastfeeding.\n- Give ORS in accordance with the advice above.\n- Encourage oral fluids as much as possible.\n- Monitor the patient's vital signs.\n- Give intravenous fluids as prescribed.\n- Check the patient's abdomen for distension or pain.\n- Observe the patient for improvement.\n- Keep the patient clean and dry. Diarrhoea can be classified as acute or chronic.\n\n【339】 #LINKS\nAcute diarrhoea is the most common. It can be self-limiting and usually lasts under two weeks.\nChronic diarrhoea lasts longer than two to four weeks and is more complex in origin.\nDiarrhoeal disease is spread from person to person, as a result of poor hygiene, and also through contaminated food or water\n\n【340】 #OBJECTIVES\nTo ensure the nurse is able to provide high-quality care to patients with diarrhoeal diseases by reducing the severity and duration of diarrhoea.\n\n【341】 #Risk factors\n- Overcrowding, e.g. in refugee camps or unplanned urban settlements\n\n【342】 #Classification\nThe WHO identifies four clinical types of diarrhoea:\n1. Acute watery diarrhoea (including cholera)\n-Can last several hours or days.\n-Dangers include dehydration and weight loss.\n-Most commonly caused by E. coli.\n-Other causes include cholera, Norovirus, Campylobacter, non-typhoid Salmonella 2. Acute bloody diarrhoea (also called \"dysentery\" or \"invasive diarrhoea\")\n-Lasts under 14 days.\n-Often accompanied by a fever.\n-Can cause damage to the intestines, sepsis, malnutrition and dehydration.\n-Most commonly caused by Shigella -Other causes include Campylobacter jejuni, invasive or enterohemorrhagic E. coli, Entamoeba hystolytica, Schistosoma mansoni 3. Persistent diarrhoea -Characterized by loose, watery or bloody stools persisting more than 14 days.\n\n【343】 #Diarrhoea with severe malnutrition (marasmus or kwashiorkor)\n-Dangers include severe systemic infection, dehydration, heart failure and vitamin and mineral deficiencies.\n\n【344】 #Epidemics\nAn epidemic is a rapid spread of infectious disease to a large number of people in a given population, usually in a short time.\nShigella dysenteriae and Vibrio cholera cause epidemic diarrhoea:\n- Shigella infection (shigellosis) is characterized by small, liquid stools with visible blood, with or without mucus. It is accompanied by abdominal cramps, tenesmus, fever and anorexia.\n\n【345】 #ASSESSMENT\nIn order to provide high-quality care to patients with diarrhoea, it is important to perform a thorough assessment and try to identify the cause of the diarrhoea and what type it is. It is essential to ensure good documentation in the patient notes and the use of fluid-balance and stool charts.\nThe following should be assessed:\n- the history of onset, frequency and duration - the consistency, colour and form of stools - whether there is any blood or mucus in the stools - associated symptoms, e.g. vomiting, nausea, fever, weight loss and tiredness - lifestyle changes, e.g. stress or travel\n- diet history and fluid intake - what medications the patient takes -laxatives, antibiotics, etc.\n- previous medical and surgical history -note any bowel or abdominal surgery - any comorbidities.\n- physical rectal exam by the doctor -checking for haemorrhoids, blood, rectal prolapse, etc.\n- assessment of the patient's hydration status -whether they are dehydrated and at what level (early, moderate or severe)\n- bloods if possible -full blood count (FBC), urea and electrolytes , liver function (LFT), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), c-reactive protein (CRP).\n\n【346】 #MANAGEMENT\nDiarrhoea should be considered infectious until proven otherwise. It is important to reduce the spread of disease to others by adhering to universal precautions. These include wearing gloves and an apron, disposing of waste immediately and isolating the patient.\nIf it is possible to determine the cause of the diarrhoea, this should be carried out without delay and the cause treated. If an underlying condition is causing the diarrhoea, this must be treated. (Underlying conditions can include respiratory or ear infections.)\nThe main goal of managing a patient with diarrhoea is to prevent further complications and treat their symptoms. The nurse should aim to correct fluid and electrolyte imbalances (which will prevent and treat dehydration), to ensure appropriate nutrition is received and to manage any comorbidities.\nCare for a patient with diarrhoea should include the following:\n\n【347】 #Preventing and treating dehydration\nDiarrhoea often results in dehydration. When a person has diarrhoea, water and electrolytes (sodium, potassium, bicarbonate and chloride) are lost through their stool and through sweat, vomit, urine and breathing.\nIf the lost electrolytes are not adequately replaced, dehydration occurs.\nFluid management will depend on the amount of fluid lost and whether the patient is diagnosed as moderately or severely dehydrated.\nTo determine whether a patient is dehydrated and to treat dehydration, consult Guideline 28, on treating dehydration.\nIf the patient is not dehydrated, prevent dehydration by giving oral rehydration salts (ORS) after each loose stool, using the amounts below. The WHO recommends that ORS be made of 75 mEq of sodium per litre and 75 mmol of glucose.\n\n【348】 #AGE AMOUNT OF ORS TO GIVE AFTER EACH LOOSE STOOL\n10 yr 200-250 ml\nChildren without dehydration can be managed at home.\n\n【349】 #Nutrition\nDiarrhoea in children is often linked with malnutrition. A child who presents with diarrhoea should also be assessed for malnutrition. When a child dies from diarrhoea, it is usually because they are severely malnourished. Diarrhoea results in a decreased intake of food and therefore a decrease in nutrient absorption, which results in weight loss and a failure to grow\n\n【350】 #Malnourishment\n- Continue to give nutrient-rich food during and after episodes of diarrhoea.\n- Encourage the mother to breastfeed and give the child ReSoMal (rehydration solution for malnutrition)\n\n【351】 #in between feedings\nNo signs of malnourishment\n- Encourage sufficient feeding/eating during and after episodes of diarrhoea.\n- Encourage regular fluid intake and ORS.\nThe diet for all patients with diarrhoea should be high in energy and nutrition. It is best to give them six smaller meals throughout the day.\n\n【352】 #Vitamin supplements Zinc\nZinc supplements have been shown to reduce the severity and duration of diarrhoea. The WHO recommends zinc be given for ten days to children under five with diarrhoea.\n\n【353】 #Dose\n- Children under six months: 10 mg once a day for ten days - Children between six months and five years: 20 mg once a day for ten days\n\n【354】 #Vitamin A\nChildren who have diarrhoea in a low-resource environment are at high risk of vitamin A deficiency. The WHO recommends a high dose of vitamin A for these children.\n\n【355】 #Medications\nThe WHO advises that antimicrobials should not be used in a low-resource environment. It can be impossible to test for the cause of diarrhoea and the sensitivity of the pathogen, which makes choosing an effective antimicrobial drug difficult.\nAntibiotics should not be given for watery diarrhoea.\nHowever, antibiotics can be helpful for:\n- bloody diarrhoea (shigellosis)\n- suspected cholera with severe dehydration - bacterial diarrhoea where the patient is symptomatic with systemic involvement.\n\"Links\", below.\nDo not give antidiarrhoeal medications or anti-emetics.\n\n【356】 #NURSING CARE\nThe nurse should also ensure the following:\n\n【357】 #Privacy\n- Maintain the privacy and dignity of the patient.\n- Put them in a private room or area.\n- Give them a clean gown.\n- Provide air freshener or deodorant.\n\n【358】 #Skin integrity\n- The skin can break down after multiple episodes of diarrhoea, especially around perianal area.\n- Ensure the area is cleansed with warm water after each stool.\n- Avoid the use of soap, as that can irritate the area.\n- Do not use talcum powder on the area.\n- Dry by gently patting the area. Do not rub.\n- You can use a barrier cram, but only apply a small amount.\n\n【359】 #Documentation\n- Ensure fluid-balance and stool charts are maintained.\nIf the patient is infectious, put a sign up and write it in the patient notes.\n\n【360】 #PREVENTION\nAim to prevent the spread of organisms from one person to the next and within the community. Measures to achieve this include:\n- ensuring handwashing with soap - ensuring access to safe drinking water - ensuring the correct disposal of human waste - ensuring food is handled and managed safely - controlling flies - encouraging breastfeeding of babies and young children - ensuring latrines are ten metres away and downhill from drinking water - giving the rotavirus vaccine for infants aged six weeks to 24 months in countries with a high incidence of rotavirus diarrhoea - giving cholera vaccines in endemic areas.\n\n【361】 #OBJECTIVE\nTo ensure the nurse is competent in detecting malaria and providing high-quality care to patients with both uncomplicated and complicated malaria.\n\n【362】 #Diagnosis/Laboratory\nAlways consider malaria in a patient who lives in or comes from an endemic area and has a fever or history of fever in the last 48 hours.\nThe WHO recommends any cases of suspected malaria be confirmed before treatment using a diagnostic test, either microscopy or a rapid diagnostic test (RDT), unless testing is unavailable. If no diagnostic testing is available and malaria is suspected, treatment should be commenced.\n- Microscopy: Thin and thick blood films can be done, which allow parasites to be detected, species determined and the percentage parasitaemia measured (the percentage of red blood cells with parasites present). A trained laboratory worker should be able to perform this test. If the blood film is negative, repeat the test in six hours and then a further 12 hours later.\n- RDT: These detect antigens of the malaria parasite present in the blood. They can remain positive for days or weeks following an infection with malaria and effective treatment. The nurse can perform this test on the ward Haemoglobin levels should be checked in all patients with severe malaria.\nBlood glucose levels should also be checked in patients with severe malaria.\n\n【363】 #Incubation period\nThe incubation period can be anywhere from one week to one year. For P. falciparum, incubation is usually nine to 14 days; for P. vivax, 12 to 18 days; and for P. ovale 18 to 40 days.\n\n【364】 #ICRC NURSING GUIDELINE 31 CARING FOR A PATIENT WITH TETANUS OVERVIEW\nTetanus is a severe infection that affects the central nervous system. It is caused by Clostridium tetani; a bacterium that is found in soil and human and animal waste. The bacterium enters the body via a wound or burn.\nClostridium tetani produces a toxin which then attacks the central nervous system.\n\n【365】 #OBJECTIVES\nTo ensure the nurse is able to provide post-exposure prophylaxis for tetanus.\n\n【366】 #DESCRIPTION Diagnosis\nThere are no lab tests available to diagnose tetanus. Diagnosis is made on clinical signs.\n\n【367】 #Incubation period\nUsually three to 21 days. The shorter the incubation period (the time since contamination), the more severe the disease\n\n【368】 #Risk factors\nTetanus is not a contagious disease It occurs in those who are not fully vaccinated or do not receive proper post-exposure prophylaxis and where there are unclean birth practices\nHigher-risk wounds are those contaminated with soil or foreign materials, such as:\n- puncture wounds - umbilical cord stumps - crush injuries - severe burns - bites - weapon wounds\n\n【369】 #Signs and symptoms\n- Pain/stiffness in the jaw (usually the first symptom, which then spreads to the rest of the body)\n- Lockjaw, i.e. trismus (causes difficulty in opening the mouth and swallowing)\n- Fixed smile, i.e. risus sardonicus\n- Headaches and photophobia - Seizures - Fever and profuse sweating - Muscle spasms in the back, abdomen and limbs - Arching of the back (due to hyperextension of the spine)\n- Sudden painful spasms (caused by sensory or physical stimuli)\n- Spasms of the thoracic and laryngeal cavity (can cause respiratory distress, aspiration and choking)\nNeonates:\n- Usually symptoms appear three to 14 days after birth.\n- The first symptoms are irritability and difficulty suckling (as their lips become rigid).\n- Then rigidity spreads and muscle spasms occur.\n\n【370】 #MANAGEMENT\nGood nursing and medical care can reduce mortality by 50%. However intensive nursing care is needed and patient will need to be hospitalized for two to four weeks.\n\n【371】 #Aspects of care include:\nAirway management\n- Monitor the patient with a pulse oximeter.\n- Suction any secretions from the patient's mouth.\n- If there is persistent laryngospasm, the patient may need a tracheostomy.\n\n【372】 #Pain control\n- Give regular and adequate analgesia as prescribed.\n- Morphine may be necessary; check with the anaesthetist.\n\n【373】 #Antibiotics\nAntibiotics are not routinely prescribed but will be decided on based on the patient's condition. The doctor may prescribe metronidazole, erythromycin or penicillin G.\n\n【374】 #Controlling muscle spasms\n- Nurse the patient in a quiet, dark, cool room.\n- Reduce stimulation as much as possible, including noise, touch, light, drafts and movements.\n- Blindfold neonates' eyes with a cloth bandage.\n\n【375】 #SEDATION FOR PATIENTS WITH TETANUS\nDiazepam -Adults: 5 mg intravenously, titrated to control spasms without over-sedation -Children: 0.2 mg/kg intravenously every two hours, titrated Magnesium Initial dose: -Adults: 5 g slow intravenous loading dose -Children: 75 mg/kg intravenous loading dose\nThen give 1 to 2 g per hour until spasms are under control (both adults and children).\n\n【376】 #Nutrition/Hydration\n- Insert an intravenous cannula.\n- Give intravenous fluids, as charted to keep the patient hydrated.\n- Maintain a fluid-balance chart.\n- Ensure the patient receives a high-calorie diet, as they will be fatigued.\n- If the patient cannot eat, insert a nasogastric tube and give feedings/medication through this (only if so instructed by the doctor and if spasms are controlled).\n- Neonates should be given expressed breastmilk every three hours.\n\n【377】 #Wound management\n- Clean, disinfect and dress the wound.\n- Extensive debridement of wounds may be needed to remove all contaminated and necrotic tissue.\n- For cord infections, do not debride or excise; instead treat for sepsis/bacteria.\n\n【378】 #Positioning\n- Try to disturb the patient as little as possible, as movement stimulates spasms. Ensure the patient is adequate supported with pillows to prevent harm.\n- However, if the patient sedated and immobile, provide gentle pressure-area care every three to four hours.\n\n【379】 #Immunization\nICRC follows the World Health Organization's guidelines for tetanus immunization. All patients must be considered unimmunized.\nAll patients are to receive a full course of tetanus toxoid 0.5 ml, one dose on arrival at the hospital and subsequent doses as per the timeline below.\n- TV1: On arrival - TV2: Four weeks after TV1\n- TV3: Six months to one year after TV2, or following pregnancy - TV4: One to five years after TV3, or following pregnancy - TV5: One to ten years after TV4, or following pregnancy  the ICRC's tetanus protocol in \"Links\", below.\n\n【380】 #Dirty wounds\n-TV4: 1 to 5 years after TV3 or following pregnancy Salmonella bacteria enter the body through the gastrointestinal tract and then spread through the bloodstream.\nThe bacteria are found in the faeces and urine of infected individuals and are spread through the ingestion of contaminated food or water and via direct contact (e.g. with dirty hands).\nIn 2018 the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that 128,000 to 161,000 people die from typhoid each year.\n\n【381】 #OBJECTIVE\nTo ensure the nurse is able to provide high-quality care to a patient with typhoid and takes effective measures to prevent the spread of the disease.\n\n【382】 #Diagnosis\nDiagnosis of typhoid can be made by:\n- blood cultures in the first week of infection - stool cultures in the second week A low white-cell count is also indicative of typhoid.\n\n【383】 #Incubation period\n- Typhoid: usually eight to 14 days but can be as early as three days and as late as 60 days - Paratyphoid: one to ten days\n\n【384】 #At-risk populations\n- People who do not have access to safe water and adequate sanitary facilities - People living in over-crowded, poor communities - Children\n\n【385】 #Transmission\nTyphoid can be spread in the following ways:\n- contaminated food or water supplies after floods or natural disasters - food outlets that practice poor hygiene - seafood from a water source contaminated with infected faeces or urine - use of toilets contaminated with the bacteria - raw fruits and vegetables that have been fertilized with human waste - contaminated milk - flies.\n\n【386】 #SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS\nTyphoid can range from mild to severe. Paratyphoid has the same symptoms as typhoid but is usually of shorter duration and less severe.\nSymptoms include:\n- a prolonged fever. This is the most common sign. The fever is either mild (38-39°C) or high (40-41°C).\nThe fever slowly increases in the first week, remains the same in the second week and slowly decreases in the third to fourth week\n- rose coloured spots usually visible on the trunk. These are a very specific sign. They present as raised, rose-red spots which fade on pressure. They can be difficult to see on dark skin.\n- a headache - muscle aches.\n- abdominal pain.\n- nausea and vomiting.\n- fatigue and weakness - chills - a non-productive cough.\n- splenomegaly.\n- relative bradycardia.\nDuring the first week, the patient will have general symptoms. In the second week the patient becomes worse, and the signs and symptoms may be severe. During the third week, general and abdominal symptoms become even worse, and the bowel may perforate, or the intestinal wall may haemorrhage. If the patient does not die, they usually recover after the fourth week.\n\n【387】 #Complications\nTyphoid can lead to:\n- intestinal perforation - gastrointestinal haemorrhage - peritonitis - myocarditis - coma - encephalitis - pregnancy complications, e.g. miscarriage, preterm delivery and intrauterine death.\n\n【388】 #Nursing care\nThe nurse should do the following when caring for a patient with typhoid:\n- Isolate the patient - Keep them under close observation.\n- Ensure good hand hygiene is practiced by the patient, the staff and any visitors.\n- Treat the fever. Give paracetamol and use cooling measures if the patient's temperature exceeds 38.5°C\nand they look unwell. Note: the fever will not come down until four to five days after antibiotics are started\n- Uncomplicated patients can be managed at home with oral antibiotics for seven days.\n- Complicated/severe cases (patients with pregnancies, neurological disturbances or altered general states) need to be admitted for close monitoring and intravenous antibiotics.\n\n【389】 #Vaccination\nParatyphoid: no vaccine is available.\nTyphoid:\n- An oral or injectable vaccine is available for travellers, people moving to endemic areas and lab workers.\nThe vaccine only lasts three years and a booster is needed.\n- In 2017, the WHO released a typhoid conjugate vaccine for countries with the highest burden of typhoid.\nThis vaccine is safe for those over six months of age. A single dose of 0.5 ml is to be given at nine months and then a catch-up dose at 15 years.\n\n【390】 #SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS\n- Patients with typhoid may present with an acute abdomen secondary to a bowel perforation.\n- Consider typhoid in any severely septic patient with a bowel perforation.\n- Even after symptoms of typhoid resolve, a person can still remain a carrier of typhoid and spread the bacteria to others. Therefore, they must take the full course of antibiotics, ensure strict hand hygiene, be tested up to one year later to see if they are a carrier and not prepare or serve food to others.\n\n【391】 #OBJECTIVES\nTo ensure health-care workers understand and effectively use protective measures when caring for a suspected EVD patient.\n\n【392】 #TRANSMISSION\nEVD spreads via direct contact (through broken skin or mucus membranes) with the following:\n- the blood or other body fluids (sweat, urine, saliva, faeces, vomit, semen, breast milk) of a person who is sick with, or has died from, EVD\n- objects that have been contaminated with the body fluids of a person who is sick with, or has died from, EVD\n- semen from a man who has recovered from EVD (through oral, vaginal or anal sex)\n- infected fruit bats or non-human primates.\na person can only spread EVd to other people after they develop signs and symptoms of EVd.\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, EVD is not known to spread through food. However, in some parts of the world, EVD can be transmitted when handling or eating wild animal meat that is infected with EVD. Mosquitoes and other insects do not transmit EVD.\n\n【393】 #RISK FACTORS\nThose at highest risk of contracting EVD include:\n- family and friends in close contact with people infected with EVD - health-care workers who do not use correct infection-control methods when caring for EVD patients.\nHealth-care workers have frequently been infected while treating patients with suspected or confirmed EVd.\n\n【394】 #SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS\nThe time between first contact with the virus and the onset of symptoms (the incubation period) is two to 21 days -eight to ten days on average. A person infected with EVD cannot spread the disease until they develop symptoms.\nSymptoms of EVD can be sudden and include:\n\n【395】 - then \"wet\" symptoms such as diarrhoea, vomiting, rash/purpura, impaired kidney and liver function, unexplained haemorrhaging, bleeding or bruising and hiccups (late-stage EVD).\nMany common illnesses can have the same symptoms as EVD, including influenza, malaria, meningitis or typhoid.\n\n【396】 #PROTECTIVE MEASURES FOR HEALTH-CARE WORKERS\nEVD is transmitted through direct contact with body fluids or with objects contaminated by body fluids. Protective measures when caring for a suspected or confirmed EVD case include:\n- good hand hygiene -either hand-washing with soap and water or chlorinated water or using alcohol-based hand gel\n- wearing protective gloves -one pair of non-sterile gloves and a pair of household rubber gloves on top wearing a protective mask with either a face-shield or glasses\nIf you are working in a health-care setting where there is an EVd outbreak, you will be provided with special training on putting on, using and taking off personal protective equipment (PPE), among other things.\nWorld Health Organization guidelines for putting on PPE\n\n【397】 #IDENTIFYING A POSSIBLE EVD CASE\nIt is important to be able to identify someone who presents with signs and symptoms of EVD.\nThe following will help you to identify EVD either in the community or at a health centre.\nAlert case (to be used in community-based surveillance)\n- Illness with the onset of a fever that does not respond to treatment of the usual cause of fever in a geographic area - At least one of the following signs: bleeding, bloody diarrhoea, blood in the urine - Any sudden death\nSuspected case (to be used by health centres)\n- Any person, alive or dead, who has or had a sudden onset of high fever and has had contact with:\n-a suspected, probable or confirmed EVD case -a dead or sick animal that was infected with the Ebola virus\n\n【398】 -stomach pain -difficulty swallowing -vomiting -difficulty breathing -diarrhoea -hiccups\n- Any person with unexplained bleeding - Any sudden, unexplained death\n\n【399】 #Laboratory-confirmed case\nAny suspected or probable case with a positive laboratory result. Laboratory-confirmed cases must test positive for the virus antigen, either by detection of virus RNA using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), or by detection of immunoglobulin M antibodies directed against the Ebola virus.\n\n【400】 #WHAT TO DO WHEN A SUSPECTED CASE HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED\nStaff trained in EVD identification, usually National Society volunteers, are responsible for screening all people at the entry point of the health facility where the ICRC is working.\nA World Health Organization (WHO) EVD identification questionnaire is completed by the screening staff for each person who presents with a high fever; if the answers on the form match with the definition of a suspected EVD case (described above) the screening staff informs the resident EVd focal point\nThe resident EVD focal point is usually a doctor or nurse trained in EVD and designated by the health centre's directorate. They are responsible for confirming the suspected case and notifying the EVd surveillance teams\nThe focal point is the link between the health centre and the Ebola response system.\nIn area with a high risk of EVD or where there is a confirmed EVD outbreak, governmental or WHO surveillance teams are in charge of responding to suspected cases or initiating an alert of early warning signs of EVD.\n\n【401】 #PATIENTS WITH FEVERS IN AN EVD AREA\nNon-ICRC patient -The identification staff members fill in the WHO EVD questionnaire.\n-If the questionnaire is negative, the patient can carry on to receive care as usual.\n2. The identification staff members inform the resident EVD focal point.\n3. The EVD focal point then contacts the EVD surveillance team. 4. The surveillance team transfers the patient to an Ebola transit/isolation centre to get samples for EVD testing. 5. Two tests of the same kind are done -if the first test is negative, the patient is tested a second time 24 hours later. 6. It takes about 24 hours to get the result of each test. From collecting the first sample to receiving the result of the second test, it takes about 72 hours. 7. The carers are considered EVD contacts, so they get registered for close surveillance and vaccinated against EVD.\n\n【402】 #ICRC patient\n-The identification staff members fill in the WHO EVD questionnaire.\n-If the questionnaire is negative, the patient can carry on to receive care as usual.\n1. The patient and their carers are isolated.\n2. The identification staff members inform the resident EVD focal point.\n3. The resident EVD focal point inform the ICRC EVD focal point (usually the head nurse). 4. The ICRC EVD focal point informs the ICRC surgical team for an urgent surgical evaluation. 5. The surgical team makes a risk analysis (is the patient's life or limb in danger? does the patient urgently need surgical stabilization? etc.). The evaluation is done while maintaining distance between ICRC staff and the patient (a no-touch evaluation).\n-If yes -the team stabilizes the patient within the ICRC EVD stabilization area using specific, advanced personal protective measures. -If no -the resident EVD focal point contacts the surveillance team to follow the two-test procedure, and the patient's carers are registered for close surveillance as EVD contacts. If the two tests are negative, the patient will be transferred back to the ICRC health facility to receive surgical care. If the patient is positive, they will be treated at the Ebola treatment centre.\n\n【403】 #GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS WHEN WORKING IN AN EVD-RISK AREA\n- Hygiene is imperative -all measures to ensure strict hygiene standards must be put in place.\n- Handwashing points (with water and soap) must be available in each room.\n- Education about good hygiene practices must be provided to staff and patients.\n- Thorough washing of the hospital wards -walls, bedside tables, windows, etc. -must be done on a weekly basis.\n- Health staff must avoid direct contact with patients, carers and their belongings.\n- The temperature of the patient and their carers must be taken twice a day and recorded in the patient notes - Visits must be restricted, and all visitors must be briefed on the need for reduced contact with patients as well as good hand hygiene.\n- If an inpatient develops any EVD signs or symptoms, the ICRC EVD focal point must be informed as soon as possible to arrange further investigation (filling out the WHO questionnaire and contacting the resident EVD focal point, if necessary).\n-for a positive questionnaire: the patient and their carer must be isolated; the resident EVD focal point must be informed and get in touch with the EVD surveillance team; all patients and carers with whom the suspected EVD case has shared a room are considered contact cases; the room and all its contents must be disinfected.\n-for a negative questionnaire: search for other causes of the presenting signs and symptoms.\n- Avoid any behaviour that could stigmatize the patient and/or their carer.\n- Ensure mental-health support is available for suspected EVD cases.\n- All health workers must be vaccinated against EVD. The Merck single-dose vaccine, known as V920 or rVSV-ZEBOV-GP, was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration in December 2019 and by the European Medicines Agency in November of the same year.\n\n【404】 #EVD RECURRENCE AND REINFECTION WITH EBOLA\nEVD is understudied, and some aspects of the disease remain unclear. Studies have examined and continue to examine the possibility of reinfection with Ebola and recurrence of EVD. The long-term implications of recurrence and infection are unknown\nSexual transmission from survivors of the 2014 epidemic has been reported. There are also documented cases of survivors who have been readmitted to hospital with a seeming recurrence of EVD symptoms.\nMacIntyre and Chughtai  report that the persistence of virus poses the following risks (p. 58):\n- transmission to others while asymptomatic (for example, sexual transmission)\n- reactivation of illness in the affected individual - transmission to others from symptomatic individuals with recurring illness.\nMore studies are needed on the subject, but a range of precautions should be taken to minimize the risk or recurrence and further outbreaks, including:\n- the use of condoms by survivors for sexual contact for 12 months, until further research is available - testing of survivors who have positive semen on a regular basis until the virus has cleared (recommended by the WHO)\n- care and follow-up for survivors focusing on preventive health measures and keeping their immune system strong, e.g. managing chronic illness, ensuring vaccinations are up to date and promoting a healthy lifestyle with a nutritious diet.

NCDs account for more than 70% of deaths worldwide, predominantly in low-and middle-income countries.\n\n【407】 #SCRUBS\nThere are many causes and risk factors leading to the development of an NCD.\n\n【408】 #Modifiable risk factors include:\n- tobacco use - physical inactivity - unhealthy diet - harmful use of alcohol - air pollution other causes are:\n- urbanization - poverty - ageing - obesity.\nNCDs are costly to treat and often beyond the financial means of those living in low-income countries.\nArmed conflict and other situations of violence have resulted in millions of people having to flee their homes and become displaced. The added stress and difficult living conditions, as well as reduced access to health care, puts this population at greater risk of exacerbating any pre-existing NCDs and/or suffering complications.\n\n【409】 #OBJECTIVE\nTo ensure the nurse is able to identify patients at risk of or suffering from an NCD and can provide highquality care to these patients as necessary or refer them to appropriate services.\n\n【410】 #THE ICRC'S APPROACH TO NCDS\nThe ICRC's health strategy 2014-18 addressed the need to take a public-health approach to NCDs in armed conflict and other situations of violence. Owing to the multiple challenges where we work, the ICRC can only address NCDs that are increasingly prevalent and may result in life-threatening risks if not treated. These include cardiovascular disease, diabetes and asthma.\nThe ICRC works by the following principles:\n- patient-centred care - a continuum of care - an integrated approach - sustainability through partnership and advocacy.\n- identifying and managing symptoms - providing essential medications and supplies to prevent complications - encouraging patients to self-manage - access to diagnostics - referral pathways - general follow-up - monitoring.\nThe ICRC has also adapted its standard list of drugs to be in line with those of the World Health Organization and Médecins Sans Frontières.\n\n【411】 #MANAGEMENT\nManagement of NCDs includes prevention, detection and treatment. This is often carried out in the primaryhealth-care setting but can also be provided in the hospital setting.\n\n【412】 #Cardiovascular diseases\nCardiovascular diseases affect the heart and blood vessels. They are the number one cause of death worldwide. They include coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, rheumatic heart disease, congenital heart disease, deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolisms.\nRisk factors for cardiovascular diseases include an unhealthy diet, lack of physical activity, smoking, obesity, hypertension, diabetes and increased blood lipids. This can result in heart disease, heart attack or stroke.\nThe nurse should monitor all inpatients' blood pressure. If blood pressure is high with no obvious cause, the patient may need non-medical or medical treatment and/or referral to a specialist centre.\n\n【413】 #Chronic respiratory diseases\nChronic respiratory diseases affect the airway and lungs. They include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma.\nRisk factors for respiratory disease include smoking, air pollution, allergens and occupational hazards.\nIf a patient has trouble breathing, shortness of breath, wheezing and/or low oxygen saturation levels with no obvious cause, further investigations may be required, including chest X-ray, lung assessment and peak flow. The patient can be treated or referred elsewhere if possible.\n\n【414】 #Diabetes\nDiabetes is a chronic metabolic disease characterized by high levels of glucose in the blood, caused by a lack of insulin or resistance to insulin There are three main types of diabetes: type 1, type 2 and gestational. If untreated, diabetes can lead to serious health problems, including: infections; damage to blood vessels; neurological, kidney, eye and heart damage; ketoacidosis; and coma. Symptoms include high blood sugar, fatigue, weight loss, increased thirst and increased urination.\n\n【415】 #COMMUNICABLE DISEASES OVERVIEW\nCommunicable diseases are caused by microorganisms, such as bacteria, viruses, parasites and fungi.\nThey can be spread by direct contact, indirect contact, air, ingestion of contaminated food or water or through insect/animal bites.\nThere are many communicable diseases, and these nursing guidelines cover certain common ones including malaria (Guideline 30), tetanus (Guideline 31), typhoid (Guideline 32) and Ebola (Guideline 33).\nOther communicable diseases that patients suffer from include tuberculosis, HIV, hepatitis, measles, cholera and kala-azar.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) and Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) provide up-to-date guidelines on most communicable diseases, which can be referred to for further management and specific nursing care.\n\n【416】 #OBJECTIVE\nTo ensure the nurse is able to provide high-quality care to patients with communicable diseases and effectively prevent the spread of disease.\n\n【417】 #CARING FOR A CHILD UNDERGOING SURGERY OVERVIEW\nChildren may require surgery for many reasons in ICRC-supported hospitals, and it is important that special considerations -both psychosocial and physical -are made for children undergoing surgery. Significant involvement of their parents/guardians in children's care pre-and post-operatively can reduce the stress, anxiety and pain the children experience and can enhance their recovery.\n\n【418】 #OBJECTIVE\nTo ensure the nurse is able to provide high-quality pre-and post-operative care to children undergoing surgery.\n\n【419】 #Psychosocial\n- Ensure the procedure/operation is explained to the child in an age-appropriate way. Enlist the support of mental health and psychosocial support staff if necessary.\n- Informed consent must always be obtained from a parent or guardian prior to surgery -see Guideline 12, on consent.\n- Parents/guardians should be encouraged to stay with the child for as long as possible before the operation.\n- Where possible, delay any invasive or traumatic procedures until the child is sedated, e.g. insertion of a nasogastric tube.\n\n【420】 #Physical\n\n【421】 - Do not withhold analgesia when the patient is fasting - An up-to-date set of vital signs should be taken and documented.\n- The anaesthetist is to be informed if abnormal vital signs are present.\n- The child should be weighed and the weight documented clearly on the patient's chart.\n- Ask a parent/guardian to wash the child. Provide clean clothing or a gown.\n\n【422】 #Preoperative fasting\nChildren are susceptible to hypoglycaemia and dehydration because of excessive fasting. Additionally, prolonged fasting can cause increased stress in the child, resulting in irritability and anxiety prior to the surgery.\nThis guideline can be found in full under \"Anaesthesia\" on the health wiki.\n\n【423】 #ICRC NURSING GUIDELINE 37 CARING FOR A SEVERELY UNWELL CHILD OVERVIEW\nCaring for unwell children who have the potential to deteriorate rapidly can pose challenges to the healthcare professional. To provide timely and appropriate care, it is important for the nurse to recognize a severely unwell child and start treatment as soon as possible. Neonates (children under three months old) normally require very specific care, which is not within the scope of this guideline .\n\n【424】 #OBJECTIVES\nTo ensure the nurse is familiar with the normal vital-sign parameters for children.\n\n【425】 #ESTIMATING WEIGHT\nFor children between one and ten years old: Weight (kg) = (age + 4) x 2.\n\n【426】 #IV FLUID RESUSCITATION FOR CHILDREN IN SHOCK WITHOUT MALNUTRITION\n-Give a 10 to 20 ml/kg bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate over 30 minutes.\n-Reassess and, if there is no improvement, give a 10 ml/kg bolus over 30 minutes.\nOngoing management/monitoring:\n- Carefully maintain the patient's fluid balance (input/output).\n- The patient's pulse rate and pulse volume should be monitored.\n\n【427】 #Disability\n- Continue to assess the patient using the AVPU scale or Modified Glasgow Coma Scale.\n- It is important to ask the parents/guardians whether the patient is acting normally, as it will sometimes be difficult to tell. Ongoing management/monitoring:\n\n【428】 #AVPU scale for children\n- If symptomatic, treat a fever with antipyretics.\n\n【429】 #Paracetamol\n- Children under one month: 10 mg/kg three to four times daily (max. 40 mg/kg daily)\n\n【430】 #Ibuprofen\n- Children between three months and 12 years: 5-10 mg/kg three times daily (max. 30 mg/kg daily)\nGuideline 14, on pain management.\n\n【431】 #FOLLOW-UP\nAll unwell children should be reviewed as soon as possible by a paediatrician or the designated medical officer.\n\n【432】 #PSYCHOSOCIAL CARE\n- Always ensure that the child is communicated with using age-appropriate techniques.\n- Always obtain consent from a parent/guardian.\n- Use age-appropriate distraction techniques, particularly when performing a procedure that may be painful or distressing for the child\n\n【433】 #CARING FOR A WOMAN AFTER A CAESAREAN SECTION OVERVIEW\nThis surgery requires technical expertise and a good obstetric knowledge.\n\n【434】 In low-resource or conflict settings, women often present at the hospital very late in their pregnancy and may have had little or no antenatal care prior to their arrival. This can affect the health and well-being of the mother and baby.\n\n【435】 #OBJECTIVE\n\n【436】 #INDICATIONS\nC-sections are performed for a number of maternal and foetal conditions. MSF  deems C-sections necessary in the following situations, as they pose a threat to the mother's life:\n- uterine rupture - absolute foetopelvic disproportion with no possibility of instrumental extraction - malpresentation that cannot be turned - severe, uncontrolled antepartum bleeding - a history of three or more C-sections in the past.\n\n【437】 ICRC NURSING GUIDELINE 39\n\n【438】 #CARING FOR THE DYING AND DECEASED OVERVIEW\nThe World Health Organization defines palliative care as \"the prevention and relief of suffering of adult and paediatric patients and their families facing the problems associated with life-threatening illness\" .\nPalliative care is medical care that aims to relieve a person's suffering, addressing the physical, psychological, social and spiritual needs of patients and their family. Palliative care treats the symptoms of a disease and the side effects of treatment. It should provide dignity and comfort. Caring for patients who are dying is an essential part of the nurse's role. The patient needs extra care and attention, and their family also needs support. They must be treated with respect according to their cultural/religious beliefs.\n\n【439】 #OBJECTIVE\nTo ensure the nurse is able to provide high-quality palliative care, ensuring the patient is comfortable and pain free and their values and beliefs respected.\n\n【440】 #ASSESSMENT\nSigns that a patient could be reaching the end of life include:\n- increased sleeping - decreased consciousness or coma - loss of appetite and thirst - decreased urine output - decreased bowel activity - weak and slow heart rate - drop in blood pressure - slow, shallow breathing - cool skin - cyanosis.\nBreathing eventually stops, and the heart stops beating.\n\n【441】 #MANAGEMENT\nAllowing a patient to die in comfort with privacy, dignity and respect is very important for the patient, their family and their caretakers. It can be very challenging and emotional for staff as well as demanding and time-consuming.\nThe United Kingdom's National End of Life Care Programme recommends health staff follow core principles for delivering end-of-life-care, including the following:\n- Treat the patient with dignity and respect.\n- Provide information and support to families and carers.\n- Respect individual spiritual, religious and cultural needs.\n- Control pain and other symptoms.\n- Provide care after death.\n- Ensure the environment is safe and comfortable .\nThe following needs should be met by the nurse:\n\n【442】 #Physical needs 1. Keep the patient comfortable and pain free\n- Give regular analgesia (intravenously or subcutaneously).\n- Provide pressure-area care every two hours.\n- Ensure the patient is comfortable in bed, with pillows and blankets.\n- Give bed baths; keep the patient clean and dry.\n- Provide mouth care.\n\n【443】 #Control nausea and vomiting\n- Give anti-emetics intravenously as needed.\n- Clean patient if they vomit and provide mouth care as necessary.\n\n【444】 #Reduce respiratory secretions\nThe patient may develop noisy or bubbly breathing which is fluid building in the lungs.\n- Hyoscine can be administered subcutaneously under prescription to dry out secretions.\n- Change the position of patient to alleviate breathing difficulties.\n- Provide gentle suction if needed; take care, as this can be painful or cause distress.\n\n【445】 #Treat restlessness\nIn the last 48 hours, the patient may become agitated, delirious, confused or restless.\nIf necessary, diazepam or a similar drug can be administered under prescription.\n\n【446】 #Improve breathing\nThe patient may experience breathing difficulties.\n- Oxygen can be given.\n- Sedation can be given, as prescribed.\n- Open windows and let fresh air into the room, ensuring a comfortable room temperature.\n\n【447】 #Emotional needs\n- Ensure close observation of the patient and be sensitive to their changing emotional needs.\n- Ensure a calm, quiet and private environment.\n- If appropriate and available, request mental health and psychosocial support for the patient and/or their carer.\n\n【448】 #Social needs\nAllow one or two visitors free access to remain with the patient during this time.\n\n【449】 #Spiritual/cultural needs\n- Be familiar with local customs and beliefs and facilitate the practice of end-of-life rituals as much as the confines of the hospital environment will allow.\n- Allow a priest or other religious leader to visit.\n- Respect the cultural practices of the patient and their family.\n- Always remember to maintain the privacy, dignity and confidentiality of the dying patient.\nICRC NURSING GUIDELINE 40\n6 People who have experienced sexual violence are often called either \"victims\" or \"survivors\". There are a range of reasons to use each term; some prefer \"victim\" because it emphasizes that sexual violence is by nature wrong, while others see \"survivor\" as being more empowering. Because of the ICRC's focus on preventing the worst excesses of war, our publications generally use \"victim\", as this guideline does. However, it's important to keep in mind that both terms are valid and patients who have experienced sexual violence may strongly prefer one or the other. 7 \"do no harm\" means ensuring that our operations do not result in adverse effects for those we work with. In relation to sexual violence, this means ensuring patients' safety and preventing re-traumatization (for example, by subjecting them to multiple interviews with service providers). Furthermore, to avoid stigmatization and labelling, the ICRC responds to sexual violence within a broader approach that addresses the needs of victims of all types of violence.\n\n【450】 #CLINICAL MANAGEMENT OF VICTIMS/SURVIVORS OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE OVERVIEW\nVictims/survivors 6 of sexual violence present to ICRC hospitals more often than is realized, as their suffering can be hidden owing to stigmatization and shame. It is important that all health staff members are sensitive to this and can recognize victims of sexual violence.\nEvery victim of sexual violence should have access to private and confidential consultation and appropriate clinical medical care performed by a skilled health-care provider. The physical and psychological consequences of sexual violence are averted or reduced with high-quality clinical management of victims, ideally within the first 72 hours following the incident.\nSetting and requirements:\n- Carry out the clinical management of victims of sexual violence according to the principle of \"do no harm\" 7 at every level of care.\n- Guarantee respect, safety, non-discrimination, confidentiality and privacy.\n- Care should be given by a trained, eligible health-care provider. This will depend on the location (e.g. in some settings only medical doctors or only national staff are allowed to provide this service).\n- Consider the gender of the health-care provider according to the country and circumstances.\n\n【451】 #OBJECTIVE\nTo reduce the physical and psychological consequences of sexual violence by providing high-quality care in the clinical management of victims, ideally within the first 72 hours following the incident.\n\n【452】 #MANAGEMENT\nMedical care\n- Ensure the patient has no life-threatening injuries such as severe wounds or haemorrhaging by performing a rapid primary survey (ABCDE) with the patient's consent.\n- Document the history of the violence and perform a clinical examination from head to toe, always with the patient's consent.\n- Treat physical injuries or refer the patient for treatment (including genital-urinary trauma and/or traumatic fistulas).\n- Provide prevention and treatment for sexually transmitted infections (including HIV, hepatitis B and syphilis).\n- Vaccinate the patient against tetanus (anti-tetanus vaccine and/or anti-tetanus immunoglobulin).\n- Provide access to emergency contraception/pregnancy test if requested or refer the patient for antenatal care for a continuing or pre-existing pregnancy.\n- Provide basic psychological support within the consultation.\n- Refer the patient for other psychological and psychosocial support services.\n- Guarantee anonymous documentation, registration and data collection.\nAdditional services (according to setting)\n- Collect forensic samples, according to the setting, project document and mode of action.\n- Provide termination of pregnancy, according to the local legal framework.\n- Identify a safe place for protection from the abuser if needed, e.g. for children or cases of domestic or intimate-partner violence.\n- In general, encourage community members to make use of services through awareness campaigns, and reduce the risk of sexual violence via other assistance programmes and camp site-planning, providing security and lighting, etc.\n\n【453】 #Basic psychological support during medical consultation\nVictims of sexual and gender-based violence are often met with unfair judgement where they, not the perpetrators, are blamed for what happened to them. Besides the violence itself, such victim-blaming and other harmful attitudes inflict additional trauma, and they create and reinforce the stigma associated with such violence. That stigma in turn tends to create huge psychosocial barriers to seeking help for victims of sexual violence who may need life-saving services, including urgent medical assistance, out of fear of negative repercussions from their environment. It is therefore of critical importance that medical staff do their utmost to mitigate such fears and instead foster a supportive environment in which victims feel encouraged to access the services they need for their recovery. Each member of the medical staff should therefore provide basic psychological support along with medical consultation. As in every medical consultation, health professionals should show empathy and a non-judgemental attitude and practice active listening. In doing so, you create a safe environment and build trust. Before any physical contact, always explain what is about to take place and request the patient's consent.\nA victim of sexual violence should never be forced to respond to questions or to accept physical examin ation.\nSuch patients might need support to overcome immediate, mild psychological difficulties and to improve their immediate functioning. Moreover, the medical staff should: provide basic psychoeducation (e.g. providing information about specific psychological reactions and sharing positive coping strategies); normalize common psychological reactions to violence; and refer the patient for psychological support if they show acute need. Bear in mind that the use of a translator can hinder the progress of developing a therapeutic relationship between the health-care provider and the patient. It is important that translators are well trained in communicating with victims of sexual violence. It is also important to ensure the translator is of the appropriate gender; for example, it may not be acceptable to use a male translator for a female patient.\n\n【454】 #HIV prevention\nProvide post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) with anti-retroviral drugs for 28 days, in accordance with national/ World Health Organization recommendations for adults and children. PEP is recommended in the following cases, which present the risk of HIV transmission:\n- unprotected vaginal, anal or oral penetration - contact with body fluids such as sperm or blood - bites involving bleeding -the patient has bitten the aggressor or was bitten by the aggressor.\nAn HIV test is not mandatory before starting PEP.\n\n【455】 #Emergency contraceptive pill to prevent unwanted pregnancy, single dose\nAn emergency contraceptive pill should be given only with the consent of the patient if the risk of pregnancy exists, as with:\n- vaginal penetration and ejaculation into the vagina or at the vulva - unprotected penetration Note: if a pregnancy test is not available, the emergency contraceptive pill will not induce a miscarriage in a pregnant woman, and the foetus will not be harmed.\n\n【456】 #Prophylaxis for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), single dose\nEven if a patient presents well after an assault, the proposed vaccinations and STI treatments should be ensured up to six months after the assault.\n\n【457】 #6-7. Tetanus vaccine and/or human tetanus immunoglobulin\nA tetanus vaccine should be given according to the patient's immunization status. Human tetanus immunoglobulin should be given in the case of a dirty wound and when the patient is incompletely immunized. In follow-up consultations, immunization should continue according to the tetanus vaccine calendar.\n\n【458】 #Hepatitis B prophylaxis according to patient's immunization status\nDuring follow-up consultations, immunization should continue according to the hepatitis B immunization calendar\n\n【459】 #9-12. Laboratory tests\nTests for HIV, pregnancy, hepatitis B and syphilis are not mandatory.\nPre-and post-test counselling for HIV should always be given.\nIf an HIV and/or pregnancy test is positive, the health-care provider should refer the patient to appropriate services for continuity of care. If a pregnancy test is positive, the woman should be referred to antenatal care or to another service able to manage unwanted pregnancies, according to the local legal framework.\n\n【460】 #13-14. Treatment of physical injuries\nThe health-care provider should evaluate the patient's physical condition and classify the severity of the injury in order to provide appropriate care and/or refer the patient elsewhere if necessary.\nThis includes:\n- wound care (disinfection, sutures within 24 hours)\n- follow-up on physical injuries: dressing, analgesics, antibiotics, human tetanus immunoglobulin - checking for skin, vaginal, rectal, mouth injuries - pain management - evaluation and referrals - care for life-threatening conditions (e.g. severe bleeding or severe wounds)\n- referral to specialized care if needed.\nFor a vesical-vaginal and/or rectovaginal fistula, the patient should be referred to a previously identified service with a fistula programme. A specific referral form has been developed for this medical condition.\n\n【461】 #Syphilis treatment\nIf a test is available and positive, treat the patient according to protocol. Syphilis can also be diagnosed with a syndromic approach. suggest that health professionals in these non-mental-health facilities experience the complex care of these comorbid patients as among the most challenging issues in their work. In a study in Greece, nurses identified the following critical incidents as the other most challenging and emotionally demanding situations: verbal and physical violence, and acute psychotic episodes.\nAnother complexity arises from the fact that, in many countries facing humanitarian emergencies, the general mental-health system is already poorly developed. Rarely is there the possibility of reaching a mental-health professional in a timely manner, which requires general health staff to handle these situations independently.\nTaking all these elements together, nurses must be as informed as possible so that they may handle acute mental-health situations safely and competently.\n-rganic causes of altered mental status must be excluded (e.g. head injury, metabolic disorders, encephalitis). Before assuming there is a non-direct physical cause for the agitation/aggression, you should try to think of following somatic reasons as the main cause for the behaviour.\n\n【462】 #Medical causes include:\n- high or low blood sugar\n- electrolyte imbalance/dehydration - malaria/tuberculosis - sepsis - hypoxia - head trauma - stroke\nOther causes include:\n- pain - fear/anxiety - a history of abuse - a history of trauma - substance or alcohol abuse or withdrawal - psychosis.\nTriggers include:\n- a new environment - other patients who are agitated - staff - a busy/noisy environment - any new infection.\n8 For example, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Convention against Torture and Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. 9 Use of a restraint can be considered \"necessary\" only when all other non-violent measures have been exhausted, i.e. when other, less intrusive measures have been ineffective or would not achieve the objective of preventing or minimizing the substantial risk of imminent physical or psychological harm to the person or others. Use of the restraint must also be restricted to the minimum intensity necessary to attain that objective. Finally, use of the restraint must be temporally limited, i.e. only lasting as long as the circumstances making it necessary persist, and no longer.\nUse of a restraint can be considered \"proportionate\" only when the benefits of its use (preventing or minimizing imminent harm to the person or others, gauged by the seriousness of the threat posed and the importance of preventing or minimizing such harm) are balanced against its anticipated harm (e.g. potential exacerbation of the individual's mental state or negative longer-term impact on the relationship between the patient and the health staff applying the measure). If the anticipated harm outweighs the potential benefits, use of a restraint would be disproportionate.\n\n【463】 #OBJECTIVE\nTo ensure the hospital team/nurse can manage most patients with acute mental illness and prevent harm from occurring to the patient and others. It is important that the nurse can manage acute psychiatric conditions to ensure everyone's safety.\n\n【464】 #INTRODUCTION\nTo provide the most adequate support to this troubled patient population, the ICRC follows a comprehensive, stepwise approach that emphasizes preventive measures in order to impede further escalation.\nTo be clear, the use of restraints means using force and must always be a measure of last resort to prevent imminent harm to the patient or others. This measure must only be used by health professionals in selfdefence or in the defence of other people Means of restraint are security measures and have no therapeutic justification. Health professionals applying these measures must also be aware that, if the principles below are not respected, their use can amount to ill treatment prohibited under international and professional standards, 8 and it can exacerbate harm or preexisting discrimination, in particular against people with psychosocial or intellectual disabilities.\nAny type of restraint and the rationale for its use should have a basis in law and be necessary as well as pro-portionate 9 Any restraint should be used for the shortest possible time, and a mental-health professional must be involved as soon as possible to initiate specialized treatment or referral to a specialized service. In addition, the patient should be informed of the sequence of actions which will be undertaken. By receiving information about what will follow, the patient can be more prepared and less anxious while maintaining maximum control.\nEvery use of restraints should always be expressly ordered by a doctor after an individual assessment and be clearly stated in the patient file, particularly if the doctor is not present at the facility 24/7.\nGenerally, any measure taken by a health-care professional requires informed consent. However, in a situation where there is a real, imminent threat of the patient hurting themselves or others, this principle can be overruled.\n\n【465】 #ASSESSMENT -GENERAL\nCentral to any intervention is a risk assessment of the patient's current mental state. Risk assessment and management is a complex process involving both objective data (such as the patient's history and behaviour)\nand the judgement of the clinicians involved. There are only a few, if any, properly validated risk-assessment tools available and the clinical judgement of an experienced mental-health professional still plays the central role overall. Nevertheless, there is a set of recommendations that will help guide less-experienced staff carrying out a risk assessment .\nOne key element of any sound risk assessment is an open and in-depth dialogue between all members of the clinical team and other parties as appropriate, including relatives, care providers and the patient themselves.\nThe other key element is that the risk assessment is a dynamic process that requires constant review. Ideally the members of a multidisciplinary team would always make decisions together; however, on many occasions (particularly weekends and evenings) decisions may have to be made by a doctor and the ward nursing team (or even the nurse alone). Such decisions should always be reviewed as soon as possible with more of the team.\n\n【466】 #ASSESSMENT -SELF-HARM/SUICIDAL IDEATION\nThe risk assessment for self-harming behaviour is probably among the most difficult tasks in mental-health care, as the wrong judgement can lead to death. As a result, staff often take more restrictive measures to avoid shouldering this burden.\nIs all self-harm done with the intention of killing oneself? This question represents one of the most important elements to consider. The clear answer is no, but as in so many other critical issues there is sometimes a blurry line, the uncertainty of which places an emotional burden on the assessor. The two main categories of self-harm can be roughly expressed as:\n1. self-harm with the intention to relieve emotional tension/discomfort 2. self-harm with the intention to terminate one's life.\nIt is important to understand the different dynamics behind these two categories, as they play a crucial role in the risk assessment of a self-harming person. The first category can generally be seen as a poor/unhealthy coping mechanism. We are all familiar with moments in which we feel emotional pain that hurts so much that we just want it to stop. Almost all of us develop coping mechanisms that dictate how we act in such moments to alleviate the feeling, which can range from going running or meditating to getting drunk or using other psychoactive substances. In order not to judge others by your own experiences, you must be aware that emotional distress/tension is produced, perceived and experienced differently in each individual. While one person may be a bit sad when a friend is angry at them, another may enter into an emotional crisis; while one person will talk with other loved ones to handle the sadness, another person will withdraw and isolate themselves for a couple of days. A frequent indicator that you are dealing with an emotionally unstable person is that the care team is split -some are seriously concerned while others say that the person is just playing or pretending\nAs mentioned before, determining whether someone is suicidal or not is a complex endeavour and includes many elements that need to be taken into account. In addition, it represents a time-consuming task, perhaps taking several hours for an adequate analysis. Whenever there is a mental-health professional at a reachable distance, this person should immediately be involved when self-harm has happened. That is the clear first step, and non-mental-health professionals are discouraged from trying it out because they think it is nothing serious and believe they can handle themselves.\n\n【467】 #MANAGEMENT\nCaring for people experiencing periods of acute mental illness or distress is challenging and demandingexperiencing it must be even more difficult. Comprehensive care involves both ensuring the safety of the patients and those around them and offering therapeutic help and support. One without the other is incomplete. The risk is that services pay considerable attention to the safety component but much less to reducing harm to the patient in the most humane way. To ensure both, staff must feel valued and supported and given the time and skills to truly engage with the patient. The process must be a partnership approach between staff and the patient where the needs of the patient are recognized and respected. There is much one group can learn from the other; therefore open, regular and conducive communication between the two is indispensable.\nNurses are the most likely to be first in line when patients or their relatives become aggressive and possibly violent. Every nurse should develop skills in verbal de-escalation, both for the purposes of nursing and for their own protection. A five-minute de-escalation intervention before things get out of hand is by far the most preferable and least harmful choice for handling a potentially violent situation. In contrast, the use of physical restraints, which is traumatic for patients and emotionally burdensome for staff, should always be the very last resort. When faced with potentially imminent violence, the instinctive human response is fight or flight, but neither of these actions is suitable for the health-care setting, where nurses have a duty of care.\nUsing the following techniques to deal with aggressive behaviour can usually turn the situation around and avoid a critical incident, which is the worst outcome for everyone involved (including bystanders).\nIt is critical that a self-harm/suicidal ideation risk assessment be done with a holistic view of the patient and their care; it should not be based only on the immediate circumstances.\nNevertheless, the best and most important measure is prevention, as every acute mental-health emergency is stressful, even if you manage in the best possible way.\nA comprehensive approach to handle acute-emergency mental health situations should include the following elements: 1. prevention 2. prediction 3. de-escalation 4. increased observation 5. rapid tranquilizers 6. physical intervention 7. post-incident review.\n\n【468】 #Prevention\nAt the beginning of a project/programme you should examine the premises with the whole team and think through a situation in which you might be faced with a violent or suicidal patient. Try at the very beginning to put in place standard operating procedures that you can follow once you are faced with such a patient.\nIdeally there would be a room that could be used as a retreat or, worst-case scenario, for seclusion, isolation and even physical restraint.\nThe more you know about a patient, the better you will be able to predict the seriousness of a violent or self-harming act. As an example: If you notice old superficial scars on their arms or legs, which are usually straight and arranged in parallel to each other, you should be aware (and ideally have the patient confirm) that they have used shallow cutting to release emotional tension. This should be noted in the patient file and pointed out to the other health personnel dealing with the patient. Without having to do a professional personality analysis, you should be able to judge whether the person is calm and rational or rather impulsive and emotional by nature. Clearly, the second type deserves more attention and caution regarding self-harm as a means of relieving emotional tension. When doing ward rounds, these aspects should always be considered, and if there are signs of emotional distress, immediate preventive measures should be taken in line with that increased attention and caution. The more you know about your patient, the better relationship you have with them, and the more attentive you are to patients identified as being at risk, the less you will encounter acute situations This significantly reduces the burden of such incidents on everyone involved.\n- Expressing that it would be better if they were dead - Expressing inability to endure the emotional or physical pain anymore - No hope for the future or not engaging in any thoughts about future life - Sentences like \"I should have died instead of my son\"\n- Changes in wording (getting darker in content) and changes in behaviour (e.g. less interaction with others)\n\n【469】 #De-escalation\nConcerning de-escalation, we need to look at three scenarios separately.\n\n【470】 #Aggression/agitation\na Find a safe environment.\nIf possible, try to move the person away from other people to an environment where they can feel safe and you are also safe.\nb Position yourself correctly.\nStand in a position of safety -usually between the person and the doorway, but not directly in front of the door so that the individual still has an escape route. Our first reaction as nurses is to move towards patients, offering a comforting touch. However, respect for personal space is vital when dealing with aggressive behaviour, as the invasion of this space can increase the level of anxiety. Stay at least two arm's-lengths away from the person. This also puts you out of reach of assault by either hitting or kicking and gives you space to evade or ward off an actual attack.\nAvoid facing the person in a full-frontal position because this is an aggressive stance and might be interpreted as confrontation. Stand slightly to the side and at an angle. Adopt a relaxed posture, arms at your sides with your hands open and facing the person. One to 1.5 metres is generally a good distance to stay at. Validate the person's feelings by demonstrating through your response that you can imagine how they feel.\nShow non-judgemental acceptance and respect. Although you might believe that the person's feelings are not valid, they are very real to the person. Allow pauses to occur because this will lower the level of confrontation as well as enable the person to think about their response Reflect the person's words back by summarizing and expressing what you believe the person has said and then allowing them to confirm or explain further. This shows that you want to really understand the situation so that the problem can be addressed.\nIgnore slights against the health-care centre or you personally, such as \"who do you think you are to tell me that\". Responding defensively will only lead to arguments. Lead the conversation back to the central issue at hand. You are the wise one in these moments!\nOnce the situation has been defused and the person is calmer, rational communication will be possible. The next step is to try to find an acceptable resolution to the problem. Set clear limits, provide necessary information concisely and, where possible, offer choices that will give the person some sense of control over the situation. A break of five to ten minutes to relax before re-engaging could help create a conducive environment. This process should be attempted several times before escalating to the next step.\n\n【471】 #Non-suicidal self-harm with an emotional-impulsive person\nWhen dealing with an emotional and impulsive person, your main aim should be to balance their emotionality and provide alternative coping mechanisms to self-harm. It is crucial to get the patient's agreement that they will alert the nurses when they feel emotional tension rising. Usually you would develop an individual toolset dependent on the severity level, which the person can use in order to reduce tension. As many of these normally include activities that demand personal initiative and proactivity, patients who have been operated on and are physically limited in a secondary health-care facility, will unfortunately depend on the active support of health staff or relatives in these moments.\nFollow these general steps:\n- Depending on your time, numbers three and four can be reversed. If you are not too busy, you may decide to increase observation before giving medication. If you are very busy, you may choose to medicate earlier, before you miss an escalation in the patient's behaviour owing to less time for close attention.\nThe first level of de-escalation should always include listening and trying to understand what is going on. To get a good understanding it is crucial to distinguish between something chronic, something new and something that happens every once in a while.\nOnce you understood the main reason for the current increase in emotional tension, try to eliminate it. If you cannot, you should try to identify other possible strategies for self-soothing. There is nothing that works for everybody. It is much more important to identify what coping mechanisms the person has used and that work for them. Listening to music might help one person, while it might cause others to fall into deeper melancholia and disturbing rumination. Television might be a good distracter, if they like watching it. Techniques like dropping lemon drops on your tongue aim to induce a strong physical sensation might distract you from focusing on your emotions. Other senses, such as smell, can also help. Relaxation techniques such as progressive muscle relaxation can be very useful and should be used if someone in the team is educated in them.\nIn general, your main aim at this stage is to overcome a difficult moment. There is a good chance that, after a while, the person will pass the emotional peak and overcome the situation as time passes and they get distracted or calm down after the cause of their distress has been eliminated.\n\n【472】 #Increased observation: Self-harm with suicidal intent\nIf you are faced with a person who wants to commit suicide, your first step is usually to increase your observation frequency and position the person where you can keep a constant eye on them. If that is not possible with existing resources, you should always consider having a family member watch them or hiring a daily worker or student in order to avoid scaling up to the last resort of physical restraint. Investment at this stage is worth it, considering the mental harm entailed by reaching the next stage.\n\n【473】 #Rapid tranquilizers\nIf you cannot eliminate the distressing factor and the mechanisms above do not work, you may offer a tranquilizing medication, especially considering our resource-limited environment. There is generally nothing wrong with using, for example, a benzodiazepine to help someone overcome an emotionally troubling moment just as it can be used for inducing sleep in cases of insomnia. It is important to be aware that benzodiazepines have a high potential for addiction. Therefore, they should be used only when necessary, and, above all else, the patient must be informed of this danger and reduce or stop the medication as soon as it does not seem necessary anymore.\nHow long can you administer a benzodiazepine before a person develops an addiction? There is no clear cut-off, and this threshold usually depends on many individual characteristics. A very safe estimate: With constant use of short-acting benzodiazepines, such as midazolam, addiction symptoms can appear after one to two weeks. With the usually used longer-acting benzodiazepines, such as diazepam or lorazepam, this timeframe expands to one to two months or more.\nGiving a benzodiazepine for a week should not worry you much. The consequences of not being able to calm somebody down can be much more severe than the use of a medication.\nUsing a benzodiazepine for a week will not create addiction. But if a patient keeps demanding it, be careful and discuss with the team how to taper off the medication slowly.\n\n【474】 #Scenario 1: The patient accepts oral medication\nThe best option you have is a benzodiazepine.\nLorazepam: Start with 1 to 2 mg, depending on the level of agitation. If you see no effect after 20 to 30 minutes, try another 1 to 2 mg. You can go up to 8 mg per 24 hours.\nIf the agitation is already extreme, gets worse or includes psychotic symptoms like delusion or hallucinations, start or switch to haloperidol; give 5 mg. If after 20 to 30 minutes you see no or minimal effect, give another 5 mg. You can go up to 100 mg orally per 24 hours.\nYou can use another anti-psychotic instead, such as risperidone (in the ICRC's list of medications).\nStart with 1 to 2 mg, depending on level of agitation. You can go up to 8 mg per 24 hours.\n\n【475】 #Scenario 2: The patient refuses to take medication and does not calm down\nIn this case you will have to switch to an intramuscular injection. The best option you have is 5 mg of haloperidol. If after 20 to 30 minutes you see no improvement, give another 5 mg injection. You can go up to 60 mg per 24 hours.\nWhen you are faced with chronic underlying aggression, your best option is risperidone, 1 to 2 mg per day.\nYou can distribute the dosage into morning and evening doses, depending on the daily cycle of the aggression.\nThe most humane way to give an injection and ensure minimum harm is for five people to immobilize the person -one for each limb and one holding their head. A sixth person must administer the injection.\n\n【476】 #Physical intervention\nPhysical interventions, like holding back a person, injecting medication against their will or applying physical restraints like handcuffs, should be the last resort, used only in case of emergency, after all the previously described measures have been exhausted and when there appears to be an imminent threat of harm to the patient or others\nThe use of force in self-defence or in defence of others must be necessary and proportional. That means the measures must be reasonable given the circumstances and must be used to the minimum degree necessary to prevent harm. Physical interventions need to be followed by appropriate documentation that describes the situation and justifies the intervention in terms of necessity and proportionality.\nIn addition…\n- The use of restraints must adhere to local and hospital policy and you should check what the law in the host country is Staff members must receive proper training before applying physical restraints\n- The reason for and process of using restraints must be explained to the patient and their family - Wrist and ankle restraints can be used with padding. They should be released every two hours, and the patient's skin and neurovascular status must be checked.\n- Document the use of restraint in patient notes.\nPhysical restraint is the final stage of escalation, where you would feel acutely uncomfortable leaving the person alone. During the day, there is the possibility of wrapping up a person in a bed sheet. Wrapping agitated people in a sheet-or towel-like fabric can lead to a quick reduction of agitation. Once you have reached this stage, you probably have already admitted tranquilizers. In order to ensure the containment of a severely agitated patient, they should usually be given an accompanying medication (either orally, if possible, or per intramuscular injection) up to the level of risperidone (orally) or haloperidol (intramuscularly). During the night, you might need to use hospital bed handcuffs, which should have protective/soft insides. Though it is a horrible image, in these moments it is probably the most humane, feasible and protective option.\nNever forget that physical restraint is always the last option, when all other options have been exhausted without the patient improving.\n\n【477】 #Post incident review\nIt is crucial to sit down together with the whole team and go through the incident, identifying positive and negative elements. It is equally crucial that these discussions not end up in blame being placed; rather they should be approached with the desire to improve, and to identify what should be changed so as to avoid making the same mistakes in the next critical incident. There are seldom perfect incident procedures, and there will always be room for improvement. If you start blaming each other inside the team, you will not reach a satisfactory consensus of how to handle these difficult, complex moments. - conventional weapons: unexploded ordnance (UXO), rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs), land mines, etc.\n- non-conventional weapons: chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) agents.\n\n【478】 #OBJECTIVE\nTo ensure all hospital staff members have an awareness of and can undertake the basic mitigation procedures in case of threat from a CBRN incident and/or of a patient with an entrapped UXO.\n\n【479】 #CBRN agents\nDepending on the agent and circumstances of exposure, these can cause severe illness or death. A CBRN incident is often associated with the CBRN hazard spreading into the environment; therefore, reducing the spread and cross-contamination is essential.\n- Chemical agents: toxic chemical substances that are natural or man-made, e.g. cyanide, chlorine, mustard gas, sarin\n- Biological agents: pathogens, i.e. bacteria, fungi, viruses, that can cause infections, toxicity and allergy - Radioactive agents: materials produced as waste from the environment or from medical/mineral/ industrial waste\n- Nuclear agents: radioactive materials released from nuclear weapons or nuclear power plants\n\n【480】 #UXO and RPGs\nInjuries resulting from UXO and RPGs are usually fatal, can cause large blast injuries and, if embedded in someone's body and still active (i.e. entrapped), pose a serious risk to health workers as well as the victim.\n\n【481】 #MANAGEMENT\nPatients with an entrapped RPG/UXO:\n- Do not bring the patient into the hospital - If the patient comes in a car or ambulance, leave them in the vehicle and ensure the vehicle is parked far away from the hospital, at least 300 m.\n- If the patient is walking, accommodate them in a room or area at least 300 m away. The room should have concrete walls; if this is not available, the area should be surrounded by sandbags.\n- Call the ICRC WEC expert in the country if possible. If not, call the ICRC regional WEC expert, and if possible also call the local explosive ordnance disposal team/army/police.\n- phone waves could trigger the latest generation of bomb fuses. never use a phone near uxo. Turn mobile phones to airplane mode and take a few photos of the front and back of the device. Once you have removed yourself to a safe distance from the patient and it is safe enough to reactivate the phone, send the photos to the WEC expert.\n- The WEC expert will be able to tell from the photos whether the device is active or not and will inform you about what safe procedures to adopt.\n- If the device is not active and the WEC expert advises that it is safe, insert an intravenous line; give intravenous fluids, analgesia and antibiotics; then leave the patient but continue to have visual contact with them from a safe distance (so they can communicate if needed).\n- Only one person should attend to the patient.\n- The surgeon and anaesthetist together with the WEC expert will need to surgically remove the device under a general anaesthetic to prevent the patient from moving. After the induction of general anaesthesia and once the patient is on the ventilator (if available), the anaesthetist should leave the room to reduce the number of staff members exposed to any risk. Once the device has been removed, patient care can continue as normal.\n- If the patient's condition is life-threatening and the device is active, you cannot touch the patient.\nDo not attempt CPR or defibrillation, as any movement will activate the device. The patient must be left alone, even if this is fatal. The danger to everyone is too great to attempt heroic gestures.\n- In all cases, remain calm, consult with WEC immediately and follow their advice.\nPatients presenting to the hospital after a CBRN attack:\n- Instruct the patient to remove all clothes and underwear.\n- Use appropriate personal protective equipment to safely dispose of contaminated clothing per the advice of the WEC expert.\n- Once the patient has showered, you must check their skin pH: Get a urinalysis dipstick and ask the patient to place it on their skin. The pH should be above 7.2; if the pH is under 7.2, the patient needs to shower again.\nThe patient cannot therefore be touched by staff, and this usually means that their condition is fatal.\n- For a cyanide attack, check whether the facility has a cyanide antidote kit. The patient will die quickly without the antidote\n\n【482】 #SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS\nNurses are not able to deal with these cases safely and require specialist WEC training.\nIf suspected CBRN cases arrive, the receiving nurse must report immediately to the head nurse or hospital manager, and WEC must be contacted immediately. The most important steps to follow are to adhere to your professional health role, respect and follow the ICRC's security rules and be familiar with and confident in practicing safe behaviours when in a potentially violent situation.\n\n【483】 #OBJECTIVE\nTo provide a basic understanding of violence against health-care facilities and personnel, and guidance on developing protective behaviours to safeguard against such incidents.\n\n【484】 #DESCRIPTION\nViolence against health care may take different forms and happen in different settings, such as:\n- verbal threats or intentional use of force, with or without the presence or use of guns or other weapons, against health-care personnel or patients\n- deliberate delay in the passage of health-care vehicles or personnel as well as the passage of patients and accompanying relatives searching for health care\n- looting or pillaging hospitals and other health-related structures and vehicles; stealing materials, drugs and other items\n- bombing or destruction of health-care facilities - kidnapping, wounding or killing health-care personnel or patients.\nAlthough all of these events are considered violence against health care -targeting and exposing healthcare personnel and patients as well as reducing the capacity to provide health care -they may have different implications depending on the context.\nIn situations of armed conflict, violence perpetrated by the parties to the conflict (either State armed forces or non-State armed groups) against health-care providers delivering health care is considered a violation of international humanitarian law because health-care facilities, providers, patients and vehicles are specifically protected under international humanitarian law.\nNevertheless, in places where there is no armed conflict, health-care providers, facilities, patients, etc. are protected under international human rights law, as it is the right of all people to access non-discriminatory, adequate and timely healthcare.\nMANAGEMENT 1. Know your rights and responsibilities as a healthcare professional.\nAlways respecting medical ethics, you should be attentive to maintaining a non-discriminatory and impartial posture, respect the confidentiality of the information you receive and apply humanitarian principles in your work. You should also have a continuous dialogue with the community to make sure that health care is well accepted and that everyone understands what is being done at the health facility.\nBeing open for feedback, with a respectful attitude towards patients and their families, is important not just for health-care provision but also for developing safer working environments. 2. Be aware of the security rules in your workplace.\nMake sure you understand and respect all security rules and that you correctly advise other team members to comply with those rules. If your workplace does not have a security-management procedure, raise this with the hospital project manager.\n\n【485】 #Inform yourself and other colleagues on safe behaviour.\nIt is important to know the contingency and communications plan of your workplace and to understand your role in that plan. Familiarize yourself with safe rooms, safe exits and evacuation procedures, and always have available at least two different modes of communication ready for use (a radio and a mobile phone, for example). Ensure all new members of the team have an in-depth awareness of the contingency and communications plan.\nIf there is a security incident at your workplace, remember and execute the necessary actions in the contingency plan to avoid panic.\nAs a general rule, if you are threatened by someone carrying a weapon or receive other threats of violence, do not engage in confrontational behaviour, make no sudden movements, remain calm, and speak calmly, quietly, slowly and respectfully. Maintain a neutral body posture, make no sudden gestures, be aware of cultural requirements (for example, females must not make eye contact with males in certain cultures) and try to listen and understand the issue at hand. It could be that the armed person is a distressed relative, in which case the situation may be defused through drawing on professional nursing experience and particularly Ensure you know to whom you should report all security incidents. Usually it is the hospital project manager, who will then pass on the information to the delegation and make sure that security incidents are reported, recorded and responded to as soon as possible\n\n【486】 #Communicate.\nMake sure information is consistently shared about the security environment in the workplace, the journeys to and from work, and the community. Ensure all health staff members (local, resident and mobile) have the opportunity to raise any concerns with the hospital project manager about the contingency and communications plan and measures in place to reduce the risk of violence, as well as other ideas they may have to better protect all staff, patients and facilities from the risk of violence.\n\n【487】 #Seek and give support if a violent incident occurs\n\n【488】 #Take other preventive measures.\nThere are other measures that can be taken to increase the general public's awareness of the protected nature of health-care facilities and staff, such as launching communications campaigns on social media, radio and TV, and placing \"no weapons\" signs on all health-care facilities and vehicles.\nRegular awareness-raising sessions in the hospital about the ICRC's work can also be helpful to ensure a good understanding of the organization's Fundamental Principles.\nHealth facilities should be regularly reassessed to ensure strong security measures remain in place.\n\n【489】 #RESOURCES\nHealth wiki wwwhealthcareindangerorg The ICRC helps people around the world affected by armed conflict and other violence, doing everything it can to protect their lives and dignity and to relieve their suffering, often with its Red Cross and Red Crescent partners. The organization also seeks to prevent hardship by promoting and strengthening humanitarian law and championing universal humanitarian principles\nPeople know they can rely on the ICRC to carry out a range of life-saving activities in conflict zones, including: supplying food, safe drinking water, sanitation and shelter; providing health care; and helping to reduce the danger of landmines and unexploded ordnance. It also reunites family members separated by conflict, and visits people who are detained to ensure they are treated properly. The organization works closely with communities to understand and meet their needs, using its experience and expertise to respond quickly and effectively, without taking sides.\n\n【490】 #LINKS\n\n【491】 #Risk factors\nGroups at a higher risk of getting malaria and suffering complications include:\n- infants - children under five years old - pregnant women - the elderly - people with HIV/AIDS - travellers - non-immune migrants.\n\n【492】 #SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF MALARIA\nThe first signs of malaria are a fever, headache and chills.\n\n【493】 #UNCOMPLICATED MALARIA COMPLICATED/SEVERE MALARIA\nThe patient has signs of malaria and a positive diagnostic test but no signs of complicated malaria.\nThe symptoms of uncomplicated malaria are below.\nThis occurs when an infection is complicated by organ failure or abnormalities.\nIt has same the symptoms as uncomplicated malaria plus one or more of the symptoms below.\n-Fever -Shivering and chills -Nausea -Sweating -Headache -Anorexia -Muscle aches and malaise -Anaemia (in children and pregnant women) -Children: abdominal pain, diarrhoea, vomiting -Impaired consciousness: delirium, coma, confusion -Convulsions -Respiratory distress -Circulatory shock -Jaundice -High fever (> 40 degrees) -Severe anaemia ,haemoglobin level  5% of red blood cells infected\n\n【494】 #MANAGEMENT\n\n【495】 TREATMENT OF UNCOMPLICATED MALARIA P.

The presence of an underlying NCD can affect a patient's healing and recovery and cause many post-operative complications.\nThe nurse plays a key role in educating the patient and encouraging them to:\n- reduce their alcohol intake - exercise - stop smoking - lose weight - eat more fruits and vegetables - reduce their salt, sugar and fat intake - take prescribed medications - attend follow-up appointments.\n\n【520】 #SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS:\nThe following children are at increased risk of complications during anaesthesia, which should be discussed with the anaesthetist prior to surgery:\n- children with gastro-oesophageal reflux and delayed stomach emptying - severely malnourished children - premature babies and neonates - significant systemic disease - oxygen saturation levels under 94%.\n\n【521】 #POST-OPERATIVE MANAGEMENT\nGuideline 13, on post-operative care.\n- Children should be kept in a warm, calm and quiet place while recovering from surgery and anaesthesia.\n- Parents/guardians should be reunited with children as soon as possible.\n- Analgesia should be given post-operatively as prescribed.\n- Vital signs should be assessed regularly, and any abnormalities reported to the anaesthetist or doctor in charge.\n\n【522】 #Ongoing care\n- Parents/guardians should be made aware of the follow-up plan, including the frequency of dressing changes and physiotherapy requirements.\n- Ensure the parents/guardians are aware of and present during any procedures performed on the child.\n- In the absence of a parent/guardian, a nurse should be assigned to the child.\n- Use age-appropriate distraction techniques during any procedure, e.g. bubble-blowing for infants or books for older children.\n\n【523】 #LINKS\n\n【524】 #ASSESSMENT: ABCDE APPROACH\nTo ensure children receive appropriate and timely treatment, the nurse needs to recognize the signs of an unwell child. As with all patients, it is important to assess the child in a systematic way. Therefore, the primary survey (ABCDE approach) is an appropriate method of identifying potentially life-threatening conditions immediately.\nDuring the initial assessment the nurse should take immediate actions to manage life-threatening conditions. The possible causes of such life-threatening conditions are listed below, but the list is not exhaustive.\n\n【525】 #Airway\nThe relatively small size and softness of a child's airway means that it has an increased chance of becoming obstructed. Children under one year have large heads in relation to the rest of their bodies.  - Ensure airway patency is maintained.\n- The child should be kept in a calm and quiet environment.\n\n【526】 #Breathing\nRespiratory illness in children is common and can be life-threatening. Ongoing management/monitoring:\n\n【527】 #SIGNS OF SERIOUS\n- Continue to assess the patient for signs of respiratory distress as above.\n- Monitor the patient's respiratory rate and oxygen saturation levels regularly.\n- Maintain oxygen saturation levels above 94%.\n- If possible, position the patient in a semi-sitting position to improve oxygen flow to the lungs.\n\n【528】 #COMPLICATIONS\n\n【529】 - post-partum haemorrhage - difficulty extracting the foetus - bladder injury - uterine tear - foetal trauma - infection of the lining of the uterus (endometritis)\n- infection at the surgical incision site - blood clots - reaction to anaesthesia\n\n【530】 #NURSING CARE\nPreoperative care\n- Ensure that consent is gained and a consent form is signed.\n- Complete all preoperative checks as per Guideline 11, on preoperative care.\n- MSF recommends the use of routine prophylaxis for gastric acid aspiration: 200 mg of cimetidine orally 20 minutes in advance (for elective cases only, not in an emergency situation).\n\n【531】 #Perioperative care\n- Carry out standard surgical skin preparation. Cleanse the surgical site with an antiseptic (povidone-iodine or chlorhexidine).\n\n【532】 - Insert a urinary catheter.\n- Give routine antibiotic prophylaxis as charted (2 g of cefazolin stat slow intravenous administration 60 minutes before skin incision).\n\n【533】 #Immediate post-operative care\nGuideline 13, on post-operative care, for routine post-op care.\nMonitor the mother and newborn every 15 minutes for the first two hours, then every hour for four hours, then every four hours if all appears stable. assess and record the following:\n\n【534】 #Mother\n- Take the mother's temperature, pulse, blood pressure, respiration rate and oxygen saturation levels.\n- Check for vaginal bleeding or any clots.\n- Check for signs of infection or sepsis - Check for fits/convulsions or a rise in blood pressure.\n- Check the fundus: It should be firm and hard. If it increases in size, it could be a sign of bleeding.\n- If the mother develops headache, dizziness or vision disturbance, call the doctor immediately.\n\n【535】 #Newborn\n- Check the newborn's breathing, colour and warmth.\nrespond to any abnormalities found and call the midwife/surgeon/obstetrician to review.\n\n【536】 #Post-op care (mother)\n- Give analgesia as charted (usually a combination of paracetamol, ibuprofen and tramadol as needed).\nDiclofenac 75 mg (intramuscular) should be given twice daily in the first 24 hours, except if the patient is hypertensive or renal-compromised.\n- Give intravenous fluids as charted.\n- Ensure the patient passes urine within six hours or that the urinary catheter drains.\n- Assist with personal hygiene.\n- Check when the patient can tolerate oral fluids and then give oral fluids as well as a light diet.\n\n【537】 #Post-natal care (mother) Elimination\n- Keep the urinary catheter for 12 to 24 hours.\n- Monitor urine output - Maintain a fluid-balance chart.\n- Encourage a high-fibre diet to prevent constipation.\n\n【538】 #Wound care\n- The initial dressing should be kept intact for 24 to 72 hours before changing - Check the outer wound dressing every shift. Note any bloody ooze or signs of infection.\n- Keep the wound dressing dry and intact. Change when requested by surgeon.\n- Carry out a review of systems in seven days.\n- Check vaginal loss every shift. Note the colour, amount and smell.\n\n【539】 #Hygiene\n- Help the patient shower or wash.\n- Ensure no intravaginal cleaning is performed.\n- Provide sanitary pads, if needed.\n- Keep the wound site dry.\n\n【540】 #Mobilization\n- Encourage early mobilization, from day 1 post-op.\n- The physiotherapist is to assist with mobilization.\n\n【541】 #Supplements\n- Treat and prevent anaemia.\n- The patient should take iron and folic acids for three months.\n\n【542】 #Breast feeding\n- Encourage the mother to begin breastfeeding straight away.\n- If the newborn has difficulty latching on, ask the midwife to help/teach the mother.\n- Monitor the newborn for drowsiness (if the mother is taking analgesia).\n\n【543】 #Mental health and psychosocial support\n- Encourage the family to the support the mother.\n- If no family member is present or the mother is struggling, ask mental health and psychosocial support staff to provide emotional support.\n\n【544】 #Documentation\n- Ensure the birth is registered.\n- Document actions, complications, vital signs, etc. in the patient notes.\n\n【545】 #Discharge\n- Give an information sheet upon discharge.\n- Refer the mother to family-planning/contraceptive services if needed.\n- Educate the mother on hygiene and nutrition.\n- Advise the mother to seek post-natal care at an appropriate facility at day 3, day 7 to 14, and six weeks after birth\nAdvise the mother to take her newborn for immunizations.\n\n【546】 #Management of post-partum haemorrhage (PPH)\nEarly PPH is blood loss exceeding 500 ml that occurs within 24 hours of delivering the placenta. This is an emergency, and the nurse must call for help immediately.\n\n【547】 1\n\n【548】 #Care for the deceased\nWhen a patient passes way, do the following:\n- Inform the head nurse and doctor.\n- Ensure the death is verified by the doctor.\n- Inform the patient's family. This should be done in a private, quiet space and with a translator (if needed).\n- The death certificate is to be filled out by the doctor.\n- Provide support to the family and help carry out their wishes in regard to the body.\n- Wash and wrap the body according to the family's cultural practices.\n- Return the deceased's possessions to the family.\n- Check if an autopsy is required.\n- Maintain privacy.\n\n【549】 #Death of an unidentified person\n- It is important to identify the dead.\n- If staff members are unable to identify the deceased, this responsibility will pass to the authorities.\nThe personal effects of the deceased must be labelled and kept safely aside, as they may aid in the identification and could eventually be given back to relatives if they are identified.\n- Record the death in the register - Follow the principles of caring for the deceased (above).\n\n【550】 #Mental health and psychosocial support\nMedical health-care providers should always refer the patient for mental health and psychosocial support, no matter how long after the assault.\n\n【551】 #Management of unwanted pregnancy\nAccording to the national legal framework and the stage of pregnancy, refer the patient to a health service performing termination of pregnancy on request. The legal framework should be analysed and services for referral identified.\n\n【552】 #Antenatal care consultation\nIf the patient was pregnant at the time of the assault or receives a positive pregnancy test during follow-up, refer them for continuity of care.\n\n【553】 #Medical certificate\nAccording to the legal framework, provide a medical certificate (to be signed by an authorized medical professional).\n\n【554】 #Prediction\nOne of the main goals is to be able to predict when a person is on the way to becoming violent or selfharming/suicidal. The most valuable element is, as mentioned, knowing the patient. The better you know them, the better you will be able to recognize subtle signs that tell you something is not right.\nAny change should raise your attention, as there is usually a reason for such changes (excepting the little daily swings that would be categorized as general behaviour). If a patient presents with depressive symptoms and you know that the person talks little and leaves the room only once a day, then you should be alert when the person doesn't speak at all anymore one day or doesn't leave the room even once.

Amenorrhea may be classified according to etiology into three subtypes, including primary amenorrhea, secondary amenorrhea, and functional amenorrhea. Primary amenorrhea is basically refers to a young girl who have not experienced menarche, at all. Secondary amenorrhea reflects a woman who had ordinary menstruation cycles, experiencing at least 3 months of absence of menstruation cycle. Functional amenorrhea is a subtype of the amenorrhea caused by exaggerated different lifestyles. Primary and secondary amenorrhea are distinguished solely based on history. Mainly the pathophysiology of amenorrhea is described in many categories, include hypothalamic, pituitary, thyroid, adrenal, ovarian, uterine, and vaginal pathogenesis. About 25 various genes, in 3 different group of Kallmann syndrome related genes, hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis related genes, and obesity related genes, play role in amenorrhea. Common causes of amenorrhea include breastfeeding, pregnancy, menopause, and stress. Primary amenorrhea must be differentiated from other diseases that cause lack of menstrual cycle, such as Mullerian agenesis, 3-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 deficiency, androgen insensitivity syndrome, Kallmann syndrome, Turner syndrome, and 17-alpha-hydroxylase deficiency. In contrast, secondary amenorrhea must be differentiated from other diseases that cause menstrual cycle arrest, such as primary ovarian insufficiency, hypothyroidism, hyperprolactinemia, polycystic ovary syndrome, and Asherman's syndrome. The prevalence of amenorrhea is approximately 3,000 to 4,000 per 100,000 individuals worldwide. The most common risk factor in the development of primary amenorrhea is chromosomal disorder and the most common risk factor in the development of secondary amenorrhea is breastfeeding. If left untreated, all of patients with amenorrhea may progress to develop infertility and osteoporosis. Common complications of amenorrhea are based on the background disease that induced it. Prognosis is generally excellent and the mortality rate of patients with amenorrhea is approximately less than 1%, generally in amenorrhea due to brain lesions. The initial laboratory tests for evaluating amenorrhea are pregnancy test, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and prolactin (PRL). Second line laboratory tests include free and total testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), and also progesterone challenge test. There are no echocardiography findings associated with amenorrhea However, an ultrasound may be helpful in the diagnosis of the diseases that can cause amenorrhea, such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), premature ovarian insufficiency, androgen insensitivity syndrome, 17-alpha hydroxylase deficiency, and also anatomic genital defects. Pharmacologic medical therapy is recommended among patients with hypothalamic causes, pituitary causes, ovarian insufficiency, and chronic anovulation. The general principle of the treatment in amenorrhea is sex hormone replacement therapy, with suitable forms of estrogen and progesterone. The mainstay of treatment for amenorrhea is medical therapy. Surgery is usually reserved for patients with either hypothalamus or pituitary tumors, Turner syndrome, and genital anatomical defects (imperforate hymen or transverse vaginal septum). The surgical treatment for hypothalamus or pituitary tumors is tumor resection via endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery. Ovaries have to be excised in Turner syndrome to prevent malignant transformation. Small incision is the main surgery for imperforate hymen and septal excision is the main treatment for transverse vaginal septum.\n\n【2】 #Historical Perspective\nThe ancient Egyptian belief honored \"menstrual blood\" as life-giving. The Mesopotamian mother goddess, named Ninhursag, is believed to have created mankind from loam and her \"blood of life\". The first descriptions about disturbances in menstrual cycle are found in Papyrus Ebres , from New Kingdom period (1450-1550 B.C.E). They described the patients as a \"women who suffers from the side of her pubic region as an irregularity of her menstruation\". In 1907, British Medical Journal, released an article about different types of treatments (mostly herbal and conservative) for amenorrhea. In 1911, some researchers evaluate the therapeutic methods presented 4 years ago and make some suggestions to manage amenorrhea better. The term amenorrhea is derived from Greek language , means lack of menstruation cycle in a woman.\n\n【3】 #Classification\nAmenorrhea may be classified according to etiology into three subtypes, including primary amenorrhea, secondary amenorrhea, and functional amenorrhea. Primary amenorrhea is basically refers to a young girl who have not experienced menarche, at all, classified as hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, and eugonadotropic state. Secondary amenorrhea reflects a woman who had normal menstruation cycles, experiencing at least 3 months of absence of menstruation cycle. It is classified as polycystic ovary syndrome, hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction, hypothalamic-pituitary failure, and ovarian failure. Functional amenorrhea is a subtype of the amenorrhea caused by exaggerated different lifestyles, classified as stress, weight loss, and exercise related groups.\n\n【4】 #Pathophysiology\nAmenorrhea is defined as absence of menstrual cycle. The pathophysiology of amenorrhea include hypothalamic, pituitary, thyroid, adrenal, ovarian, uterine, and vaginal causes. About 25 different genes are involved in the pathogenesis of amenorrhea such as 3 different groups of Kallmann syndrome related genes, hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis related genes, and obesity related genes. On gross pathology, normal endometrium is the characteristic findings of amenorrhea. Patients of amenorrhea from craniopharyngioma have cystic mass filled with motor oil-like fluid on gross pathology. On microscopic histopathological analysis, craniopharyngioma presents as trabecular squamous epithelium surrounded by palisaded columnar epithelium, small-to-medium sized cells with moderate amount of basophilic cytoplasm, bland nuclei, and calcifications. On microscopic histopathological analysis, pituitary adenoma as a cause of amenorrhea presents as loss of fibrous stroma and nested cells of normal anterior pituitary (based on the type of adenoma).\n\n【5】 #Causes\nCommon causes of amenorrhea are breastfeeding, pregnancy, menopause, and stress. Common causes of primary amenorrhea are craniopharyngioma, idiopathic gonadotropin deficiency, Kallmann's syndrome, Mayer-Rokitansky-Hauser Syndrome, Mullerian dysgenesis, and outflow tract disorders. Common causes of secondary amenorrhea are craniocerebral trauma, curettage, Cushing's syndrome, depression, diabetes mellitus, and drug side effects. Common causes of functional amenorrhea are stress, rapid weight loss, and excessive exercise.\n\n【6】 #Differentiating Amenorrhea from Other Diseases\nAs amenorrhea manifests in a variety of clinical forms, differentiation must be established in accordance with the particular subtype. Primary amenorrhea must be differentiated from other diseases that cause lack of menstrual cycle, such as Mullerian agenesis, 3-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 deficiency, androgen insensitivity syndrome, Kallmann syndrome, Turner syndrome, and 17-alpha-hydroxylase deficiency. In contrast, secondary amenorrhea must be differentiated from other diseases that cause menstrual cycle arrest, such as primary ovarian insufficiency, hypothyroidism, hyperprolactinemia, polycystic ovary syndrome, and Asherman's syndrome.\n\n【7】 #Epidemiology and Demographics\nThe incidence of primary amenorrhea is approximately 3,000 cases per 100,000 individuals, mostly due to hypothalamic amenorrhea. The incidence of secondary amenorrhea is approximately 3,300 per 100,000 individuals. The prevalence of amenorrhea is approximately 3,000 to 4,000 per 100,000 individuals worldwide. The prevalence of amenorrhea was estimated to be 13,400 cases per 100,000 female athletes. The mortality rate of amenorrhea is less than 1%, and seen in patients of pituitary macroadenomas or generally brain lesions which cause amenorrhea. Primary amenorrhea is initially diagnosed among adolescents, 16 years of age. There is no racial predilection for amenorrhea. Commonly, females in developed countries experience puberty and menarche earlier than females of developing countries. This can be attributed to nutritional and socioeconomic situation but since the age of diagnosis of primary amenorrhea is based on the society's mean age of puberty onset and menarche, there is not any difference between developing and developed countries in terms of prevalence of amenorrhea.\n\n【8】 #Risk Factors\nThe most common risk factor in the development of primary amenorrhea is chromosomal disorder and the most common risk factor in the development of secondary amenorrhea is breastfeeding. Common risk factors in the development of amenorrhea include risk factors related to hypothalamus, pituitary, ovaries, and also functional amenorrhea. Most common hypothalamic risk factors are Kallmann syndrome and chronic disorders. Most common pituitary risk factors are hyperprolactinemia and pituitary microadenoma.\n\n【9】 #Screening\nAccording to the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), there is insufficient evidence to recommend routine screening for amenorrhea.\n\n【10】 #Natural History, Complications, and Prognosis\nIf left untreated, all of patients with amenorrhea may progress to develop infertility and osteoporosis. Common complications of amenorrhea are based on the background disease that induced it. Prognosis is generally excellent and the mortality rate of patients with amenorrhea is approximately less than 1%, generally in brain lesions.\n\n【11】 ## Diagnostic Criteria\nThere are no established criteria for the diagnosis of amenorrhea. Diagnosis is based on delayed or absent menstrual cycle.\n\n【12】 ## History and Symptoms\nThe hallmark of primary amenorrhea is lack of menarche 15 years of age, while other secondary sexual characteristics are already appeared; or lack of menarche after 5 years of thelarche, if it is occurred before 10 years of age. The hallmark of secondary amenorrhea is menstrual cycle interruption for at least 3 months, however was regular before; or menstrual cycle interruption for at least 6 months, however was irregular before.\n\n【13】 ## Physical Examination\nPhysical examination of patients with amenorrhea is based on underlying disease. The presence of hirsutism and acne on physical examination is diagnostic of polycystic ovary disease. The presence of galactorrhea and vision loss on physical examination is diagnostic of hyperprolactinemia (prolactinoma). The presence of bulging in vulva and imperforated hymen on physical examination is highly suggestive of imperforate hymen.\n\n【14】 ## Laboratory Findings\nThe initial laboratory tests for evaluating amenorrhea are pregnancy test, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and prolactin (PRL). Second line laboratory tests include free and total testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), and also progesterone challenge test.\n\n【15】 ## Electrocardiogram\nThere are no ECG findings associated with amenorrhea.\n\n【16】 ## X-ray\nThere are no X-ray findings associated with amenorrhea, exclusively. There are no X-ray findings associated with most common causes of amenorrhea, like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and premature ovarian failure. However, an  X-ray may be helpful in the diagnosis of delayed puberty.\n\n【17】 ## Echocardiography/Ultrasound\nThere are no echocardiography findings associated with amenorrhea However, an ultrasound may be helpful in the diagnosis of the diseases that can cause amenorrhea, such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), premature ovarian insufficiency, androgen insensitivity syndrome, 17-alpha hydroxylase deficiency, and also anatomic genital defects.\n\n【18】 ## CT scan\nHowever, a CT scan may be helpful in the diagnosis of the diseases that can cause amenorrhea, such as Turner syndrome, androgen insensitivity syndrome and also anatomic genital defects.\n\n【19】 ## MRI\nThere are no MRI findings associated with amenorrhea. However, a MRI may be helpful in the diagnosis of the diseases that can cause amenorrhea, such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), androgen insensitivity syndrome, anatomic genital defects, and also pituitary adenoma.\n\n【20】 ## Other Imaging Findings\nHysterosalpingography (HSG) may be helpful in the diagnosis of the anatomic defects that can cause amenorrhea. Findings on a hysterosalpingography diagnostic of Asherman syndrome include multiple irregular linear (or lacunar) filling defects showing intrauterine adhesion, inability to distend the endometrial cavity, and totally non-filled uterine mostly in severe cases. Testicular scan can diagnosis the intra-abdominal or inguinal testes in androgen insensitivity syndrome.\n\n【21】 ## Other Diagnostic Studies\nKaryotyping is used to diagnose amenorrhea caused by chromosomal disorders, such as Turner syndrome. University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT), consist of microencapsulated odorants released by scratching standardized odor-impregnated questionnaires, is used to detect hyposmia or anosmia in Kallmann syndrome.\n\n【22】 ## Medical Therapy\nPharmacologic medical therapy is recommended among patients with hypothalamic causes, pituitary causes, ovarian insufficiency, and chronic anovulation. The general principle of the treatment in amenorrhea is sex hormone replacement therapy, mostly with suitable forms of estrogen and progesterone.\n\n【23】 ## Surgery\nThe mainstay of treatment for amenorrhea is medical therapy. Surgery is usually reserved for patients with either hypothalamus or pituitary tumors, Turner syndrome, and genital anatomical defects (imperforate hymen or transverse vaginal septum). The surgical treatment for hypothalamus or pituitary tumors is tumor resection via endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery. Ovaries have to be excised in Turner syndrome to prevent malignant transformation. Small incision is the main surgery for imperforate hymen and septal excision is the main treatment for transverse vaginal septum.\n\n【24】 ## Primary Prevention\nBased on US Preventive Services Task Force (USPTSF), there are no established measures for the primary prevention of amenorrhea.\n\n【25】 ## Secondary Prevention\nEffective measures for the secondary prevention of functional hypothalamic amenorrhea include oral contraceptive pills (OCPs), androgen therapy, recombinant insulin like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), recombinant leptin, bisphosphonates, and increasing calorie intake.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}
