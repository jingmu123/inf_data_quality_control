This is because drug exposure is greater with the Oral Solution than with the Capsules when the same dose of drug is given. In addition, the topical effects of mucosal exposure may be different between the two formulations. Only the Oral Solution has been demonstrated effective for oral and/or esophageal candidiasis.\nHepatic Effects\nSPORANOX has been associated with rare cases of serious hepatotoxicity, including liver failure and death. Some of these cases had neither pre-existing liver disease nor a serious underlying medical condition, and some of these cases developed within the first week of treatment. If clinical signs or symptoms develop that are consistent with liver disease, treatment should be discontinued and liver function testing performed. Continued SPORANOX use or reinstitution of treatment with SPORANOX is strongly discouraged unless there is a serious or life-threatening situation where the expected benefit exceeds the risk. (\nCardiac Dysrhythmias\nLife-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias and/or sudden death have occurred in patients using cisapride, pimozide, methadone, levacetylmethadol (levomethadyl), or quinidine concomitantly with SPORANOX and/or other CYP3A4 inhibitors. Concomitant administration of these drugs with SPORANOX is contraindicated. (\nCardiac Disease\nSPORANOX Capsules should not be administered for the treatment of onychomycosis in patients with evidence of ventricular dysfunction such as congestive heart failure (CHF) or a history of CHF. SPORANOX Capsules should not be used for other indications in patients with evidence of ventricular dysfunction unless the benefit clearly outweighs the risk.\nFor patients with risk factors for congestive heart failure, physicians should carefully review the risks and benefits of SPORANOX therapy. These risk factors include cardiac disease such as ischemic and valvular disease; significant pulmonary disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; and renal failure and other edematous disorders. Such patients should be informed of the signs and symptoms of CHF, should be treated with caution, and should be monitored for signs and symptoms of CHF during treatment. If signs or symptoms of CHF appear during administration of SPORANOXCapsules, discontinue administration.\nItraconazole has been shown to have a negative inotropic effect. When itraconazole was administered intravenously to anesthetized dogs, a dose-related negative inotropic effect was documented. In a healthy volunteer study of itraconazole intravenous infusion, transient, asymptomatic decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction were observed using gated SPECT imaging; these resolved before the next infusion, 12 hours later.\n cases reported among those receiving lower total daily doses.\nCalcium channel blockers can have negative inotropic effects which may be additive to those of itraconazole. In addition, itraconazole can inhibit the metabolism of calcium channel blockers. Therefore, caution should be used when co-administering itraconazole and calcium channel blockers due to an increased risk of CHF. Concomitant administration of SPORANOX and nisoldipine is contraindicated.\nCases of CHF, peripheral edema, and pulmonary edema have been reported in the post-marketing period among patients being treated for onychomycosis and/or systemic fungal infections. (\nPRECAUTIONS\nGeneral\nSPORANOX (itraconazole) Capsules should be administered after a full meal. (\nUnder fasted conditions, itraconazole absorption was decreased in the presence of decreased gastric acidity. The absorption of itraconazole may be decreased with the concomitant administration of antacids or gastric acid secretion suppressors. Studies conducted under fasted conditions demonstrated that administration with 8 ounces of a cola beverage resulted in increased absorption of itraconazole in AIDS patients with relative or absolute achlorhydria. This increase relative to the effects of a full meal is unknown. (\nHepatotoxicity\nRare cases of serious hepatotoxicity have been observed with SPORANOX treatment, including some cases within the first week. In patients with elevated or abnormal liver enzymes or active liver disease, or who have experienced liver toxicity with other drugs, treatment with SPORANOX is strongly discouraged unless there is a serious or life threatening situation where the expected benefit exceeds the risk. Liver function monitoring should be done in patients with pre-existing hepatic function abnormalities or those who have experienced liver toxicity with other medications and should be considered in all patients receiving SPORANOX. Treatment should be stopped immediately and liver function testing should be conducted in patients who develop signs and symptoms suggestive of liver dysfunction.\nNeuropathy\nIf neuropathy occurs that may be attributo SPORANOX Capsules, the treatment should be discontinued.\nHearing Loss\nTransient or permanent hearing loss has been reported in patients receiving treatment with itraconazole. Several of these reports included concurrent administration of quinidine which is contraindicated  BOX WARNING: Drug Interactions; CONTRAINDICATIONS: Drug Interactions andPRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions). The hearing loss usually resolves when treatment is stopped, but can persist in some patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

It was originally described in 1950. The use of esophageal tamponade in the treatment of bleeding varices has been known since Westphal described it in 1930.\nIt consists of a multiluminal plastic tube with two inflaballoons. Apart from the balloons, two lumens serve the proximal esophagus and the gastric tip of the device, respectively (although earlier devices had no oesophageal lumen, requiring the parallel insertion of a nasogastric tube). It is passed down into the oesopagus and the distal balloon inflated in the stomach. Distension of the proximal balloon is used to stop bleeding from the varices. The gastric lumen is for aspirating stomach contents.\nGenerally it is used only in emergencies where bleeding from presumed varices is impossible to control by administration of medication. It may be difficult to position, particularly in an unwell patient, and may inadvertently be inserted in the trachea, hence endotracheal intubation before the procedure is strongly advised to secure the airway. The tube is often kept in the refrigerator in the hospital's emergency department, intensive care unit and gastroenterology ward. It is a temporary measure: ulceration and rupture of the esophagus and stomach are recognized complications.\nA related device with a larger gastric balloon capacity, the Linton-Nachlas tube, is used for isolated gastric hemorrhage (such as with gastric varices).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Methods: We performed a systematic search of publication databases to identify studies of medical management of pediatric Crohn's disease. Quality of evidence and strength of recommendations were rated according to the GRADE (Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach. We developed statements through an iterative online platform and then finalized and voted on them. Results: The consensus includes 25 statements focused on medical treatment options. Consensus was not reached, and no recommendations were made, for 14 additional statements, largely due to lack of evidence. The group suggested corticosteroid therapies (including budesonide for mild to moderate disease). The group suggested exclusive enteral nutrition for induction therapy and biologic tumor necrosis factor antagonists for induction and maintenance therapy at diagnosis or at early stages of severe disease, and for patients failed by steroid and immunosuppressant induction therapies. The group recommended against the use of oral 5-aminosalicylate for induction or maintenance therapy in patients with moderate disease, and recommended against thiopurines for induction therapy, corticosteroids for maintenance therapy, and cannabis in any role. The group was unable to clearly define the role of concomitant immunosuppressants during initiation therapy with a biologic agent, although thiopurine combinations are not recommended for male patients. No consensus was reached on the# \nWhile inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has become a global disease, the incidence and prevalence of both pediatric-and adult-onset IBD in Canada remain among the highest worldwide. 1,2 Canadian data suggest that the incidence may have stabilized among adults, but continues to increase in children, reaching 9.68 (95% confidence interval , 9.11-10. per 100,000 children under age 16 years for the period 1999-2010. 2 Although the highest percentage increases in incidence were among children aged younger than 5 years at time of diagnosis, pediatric-onset IBD still develops most commonly in adolescence. 2 Crohn's disease (CD) predominates over ulcerative colitis, accounting for 65.6% of pediatric IBD based on national administrative data up until 2010, 2 and occurring in 62% of 1146 children in the Canadian Children IBD Network inception cohort study. 3 Pediatric CD encompasses a heterogeneous spectrum of phenotypic features (as recognized by the Paris modification of the Montreal classification , disease severity, and treatment responsiveness. Intestinal healing, rather than symptom control alone, has become an important therapeutic goal. 5 This may be especially important in young patients, given the potential for growth impairment as a direct effect of persistent chronic inflammation 6,7 and their long lives ahead, during which disease complications may occur. Mucosal healing became a realistic goal for patients with the advent of monoclonal antibodies directed against tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. As alternate pathway biologic agents and new small molecule therapies emerge, it behooves clinicians to recommend treatment of pediatric CD based on critical evaluation of efficacy and safety.\nChoice of treatment for active pediatric CD must always be made with a maintenance strategy in mind.\nWhen the pediatric consensus group met in October 2017, the most recent consensus guidelines for the treatment of CD in pediatric patients were those from the European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition and the European Crohn's and Colitis Organization published in April 2014, which incorporated data published until June 2013. 8 The Canadian Association of Gastroenterology (CAG) has established infrastructure for the development of consensus clinical practice guidelines, 9 but to date has focused on adult patients, including consensus guidelines for both luminal and fistulizing CD. Given the increasing prevalence of pediatric CD, the challenges specific to young patients, and the uncertainties around treatment choices, the Canadian Children IBD Network partnered with CAG to systematically review the literature relating to the medical management of luminal CD and to develop specific recommendations for pediatric patients.\n\n【1】 # Methods\n\n【2】 # Scope and Purpose\nThis guideline focuses on the medical management of luminal CD in pediatric patients, and does not specifically address the diagnostic evaluation of luminal CD, the role of surgical management, growth monitoring, social and psychological interventions, and preventative health measures, such as vaccinations. Specific questions pertaining to the medical management of luminal CD in pediatric patients Abbreviations used in this paper: were developed by the steering committee (DM, AG, EIB, JC, JD, and JM) and GRADE (Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) experts (PM, FT).\nRecommendations were developed by all members of the group at a face-to-face meeting in October 2017.\n\n【3】 # Definitions Used in Framing Questions\n\n【4】 # Disease activity\nThe categories of disease activity discussed in this guideline (mild to moderate and moderate to severe active CD) were defined in many clinical trials according to the Crohn's Disease Activity Index in studies involving adult patients or the Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index in studies involving children. Therefore, in general, descriptions of activity in this document reflect Crohn's Disease Activity Index or Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index scores, as described in the evidence.\n\n【5】 # Outcomes\nClinical remission was consistently chosen as the primary outcome in the statements because of knowledge that until recently \"clinical remission\" (usually defined by a multi-item measure of disease activity) has been the primary end point in clinical trials assessing treatment efficacy. Evidence of efficacy of specific treatments in achieving mucosal healing is limited, therefore, \"complete\" or \"deep\" remission (clinical remission plus mucosal healing) was not the chosen primary outcome in this guideline. Mucosal healing, however, is increasingly replacing \"clinical remission\" as a treatment target for adults and children with IBD. 5 Such healing has been associated with sustained clinical remission and a reduced need for hospitalization and surgery.  Statements regarding the importance of evaluating mucosal healing in pediatric patients achieving clinical remission were therefore discussed, despite the limitations of existing data precluding its choice as a primary outcome.\nClinical response was defined as reduction in symptoms determined by clinically meaningful changes in a multi-item measure of disease activity, in the absence of complete resolution of symptoms.\n\n【6】  and Searches\nA systematic search of the literature relevant to the selected questions from January 2000 to June 2017 was conducted by the Editorial Office of the Cochrane Upper Gastrointestinal and Pancreatic Diseases Group at McMaster University using MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central, and Cochrane database of systematic reviews. Key search terms included pediatric, Crohn's, antibiotic, 5-aminosalicylate, corticosteroid, anti-tumour necrosis factor, thiopurine, methotrexate, vedolizumab, ustekinumab, and enteral nutrition. The search was limited to human studies and English publications; additional details of the search strategies utilized are provided in the Supplementary Material \n\n【7】 # Assessment of the Quality of Evidence\nTwo non-voting methodologists (PM, FT) used the GRADE approach 15 to assess the strength of the evidence for each statement. The quality of evidence for each consensus statement was classified as high, moderate, low, or very low, as described in GRADE 15,16 and used in previous CAG consensus guidelines.  Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) began as high-quality evidence but could be downgraded because of heterogeneity or inconsistency of results, imprecision, indirect study findings, reporting bias, or if it was determined that a high risk of bias existed across studies supporting the statement. Data from observational studies began as low-quality evidence, but could be lowered because of the same factors, or raised if a very large treatment effect or a dose-response relationship was identified, or if all plausible biases would change the magnitude of effect toward the opposite direction. 15,16 Using the GRADE approach, it is rare to have high-quality evidence unless it fulfills all domains in terms of risk of bias, inconsistency, imprecision, indirectness, and no other bias (eg, publication bias). The evidence is always reviewed in relation to the PICO (patient population, intervention, comparator, and outcome) question. So, the trials may be high methodological quality, but if they do not address the PICO question directly in terms of populations, interventions, and outcomes, the evidence will be downgraded. In addition to an updated review of the literature, new meta-analyses were performed for this consensus.\nMuch of the evidence for the efficacy and safety of CD treatments was available from RCTs conducted in adult populations. In some cases, the quality of evidence was downgraded for indirectness with respect to the populations when no studies were found that evaluated the drug in children, and as such both safety and effectiveness data had to be extrapolated from adult studies. Considering the course of disease, responses to treatments and dose-response relationships may differ between pediatric and adult populations with CD and, as such, the evidence was less certain in children than in adults when only adult data were available. However, if there were studies done in children (even observational in nature) that supported the findings in adults, the evidence was not downgraded for indirectness. In some cases, when confronted by very-low-quality evidence in the absence of a compelling benefit to risk ratio, the consensus group agreed not to make a recommendation for or against a particular strategy.\nApproved product labeling from government regulatory agencies varies from country to country, and although it was not ignored, recommendations were based on evidence from the literature and consensus discussion, and may not fully reflect the product labeling for a given country.\n\n【8】 # Consensus Process\nThe 2-day, face-to-face consensus meeting was held in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, in October 2017. The consensus group was composed of 15 voting pediatric gastroenterologists, from Canada and the United States with expertise in multiple areas, including nutrition (SL, WE, HH, AO), growth impairment in IBD (TW, AG), microbiome (DM), clinical epidemiology, health services research and quality improvement (EB, PJ, AO, MS, MDK, WE), and patient-reported measures or patient engagement (AO, MDK). Non-voting participants included the co-chairs (AG, DM), GRADE experts (PM, FT), a representative from the adult CD CAG consensus group ( JM), nonvoting observers, and the co-moderators (PM, DS). At the consensus conference, data and the GRADE evaluations of the evidence were presented, and each individual statement was discussed and the wording finalized. Participants voted on their level of agreement for each statement. If ≥75% of participants voted 4 (agree) or 5 (strongly agree) on a 1-5 scale  and these statements were rejected. The evidence that was reviewed for these statements and the discussion has been summarized in the text, but the consensus group did not make a recommendation for or against these treatment strategies.\nThe manuscript was initially drafted by the co-chairs (DM, AG), and then reviewed and revised by the GRADE experts and members of the steering committee before being sent to the full consensus group for review. Upon approval from the group, the manuscript was made available to all CAG members for comment during a 2-week period before submission for publication.\nIn accordance with CAG policy, written disclosures of any potential conflicts of interest for the 24 months preceding the consensus meeting were provided by all participants, and made available to all group members, and CAG members reviewing the manuscript.\n\n【9】 # Role of the Funding Sources", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Approximately 80% of wide complex tachycardias are due to ventricular tachycardia.\n\n【3】 # Differential Diagnosis of Wide Complex Tachycardia: Distinguishing VT from SVT\nFor more detailed information regarding how to differentiate VT from SVT please view the differential diagnosis page or click here.\nDifferentiating between VT and SVT as the cause of wide complex tachycardia is absolutely critical because the treatment options are quite different for VT versus SVT with aberrancy.\n\n【4】 ## Ventricular Tachycardia\nThe diagnosis of VT is more likely if:\n- There is a history of myocardial infarction, myocardial ischemia, heart failure or structural heart disease\n- The electrical axis is -90 to -180 degrees (a “northwest” or “superior” axis)\n- The QRS is > 140 msec\n- There is AV dissociation\n- There are positive or negative QRS complexes in all the precordial leads\n- The morphology of the QRS complexes resembles that of a previous premature ventricular contraction (PVC).\n- Hemodynamic stability does not reliably differentiate VT from SVT.  Patients with ventricular tachycardia can often be hemodynamically s, and svital signs do not rule out ventricular tachycardia.  This is often a major mistake on the part of clinicians and can lead to inappropriate treatment of VT as SVT with poor outcomes. \n\n【5】 ## Supraventricular Tachycardia with Aberrant Conduction\nThe diagnosis of atrial fibrillation with aberrant conduction should be considered if\n- The heart rate is over 200 beats per minute\n- If the rhythm is grossly irregularly irregular\n\n【6】 ## Pre-Excitation\nThe diagnosis of rapid conduction down a bypass tract due to ventricular pre-excitation such as Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW) should be considered if\n- There is intermittent present of a Delta wave\n- There is intermittently a short PR interval\n\n【7】 ## Paced Rhythms\nA paced rhythm as a cause of wide complex tachycardia is infrequent.  This diagnosis is suggested if\n- A pacemaker is in place and there is a LBBB pattern with superior left axis deviation, however, depending on the site of pacing this pattern can vary significantly\n- A wide complex tachycardia can be due to an SVT if the pacemaker is tracking sensed atrial activity and is pacing the ventricles rapidly as result\n- Pacemaker-mediated tachycardia may be present if there is retrograde conduction which triggers atrial activity during ventricular pacing.\n- Runaway pacemaker syndrome in which the pacemaker fires at a rate of nearly 2000 bpm and captures intermittently\n- Sensor induced tachycardia in which case the pacemaker fires at a rate of nearly 160-180 bpm in response to electrocautery, noise, vibration, limb movement or other stimuli.\n\n【8】 ## Other Conditions\n- ECG artifact\n- Ventricular fibrillation is usually more chaotic\n\n【9】 # Epidemiology and Demographics\nThe underlying cause of wide complex tachycardia tends to be ventricular tachycardia (VT) in patients > 35 years of age (sensitivity of 92% and a positive predictive value of 85% for VT) and supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with aberrancy in patients < 35 years of age (positive predictive value of approximately 70%).\n\n【10】 # Risk Factors\nRisk factors for the ventricular tachycardia as a cause of wide complex tachycardia include a history of prior myocardial infarction, a history of congestive heart failure, and a history of recent angina pectoris.  These three historical features have positive predictive values for VT of > 95% in a small study, but sensitivities of 66%, 24%, and 24%, respectively.  Wide complex tachycardia will be due to VT in 98% of cases if there's a history of structural heart disease.  Only 7% of patients with SVT with aberrancy will have had a prior myocardial infarction (MI).\n\n【11】 # Electrocardiogram\nWide complex tachycardia is defined as a heart rate > 100 beats per minute and a QRS duration > 120 ms.\n\n【12】 VT with right bundle branch block morphology: AV dissociation is present, the QRS interval is greater than 140 ms, and the complexes are all up right in the anterior precordial leads consistent with ventricular tachycardia as the origin of the rhythm.\n\n【13】 :\nShown below is a patient with sinus tachycardia and WPW which mimics VT: A Delta wave consistent with pre-excitation is present.\n\n【14】 # Laboratory Studies\nElectroyte abnormalities such as hypokalemia (which can be associated with ventricular tachycardia), and hypomagnesemia (which can lead to Torsade de Pointes) should be ruled out.\n\n【15】 # Medical Therapy\nThe management of wide complex tachycardia should begin by assessing the patient's ABCs (airway, breathing, and circulation).  If the patient is unsand either hypotension, altered mental status, chest pain, heart failure or seizures are present, then immediate synchronized cardioversion should be performed.  If the patient is s, the optimal management depends upon the differentiation of ventricular tachycardia versus supraventricular tachycardia with aberrant conduction as a cause of the wide complex tachycardia.  Treatment targeted at the underlying cause can then be initiated.  A wide complex tachycardia should be assumed to be and managed as though it is due to ventricular tachycardia until proven otherwise.  This is true even in a hemodynamically spatient until proven otherwise (VT can often be hemodynamically s.  The initial management strategy includes avoiding the use of a long acting AV nodal blocking agent and drugs that suppress left ventricular contractility such as verapamil which can induce hypotension in a previously spatient.\nAlgorithm based on the 2003 ACLS guidelines for the management of tachycardia.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Lung cancer mortality among U.S. uranium miners: A reappraisal.# FOREWORD\nAs Director of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), I am accustomed to making decisions on difficult issues, but few issues have presented the legislative, scientific, and public health dilemmas that accompany recommending criteria to control the exposure of workers to radon progeny in underground mines.\n authorizes NIOSH to recommend new criteria to further improve working conditions s 22(c) and (d)].\nIn addition, the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969  and the Federal Mine Safety and Health Amendments Act of 1977  require NIOSH to develop and revise recommended occupational safety and health standards for mine workers. Specifically, the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare (now the Secretary of Health and Human Services) is required to consider, \"in addition to the attainment of the highest degree of health protection for the miner . . . the latest available scientific data in the field, the technical feasibility of the standards, and experience gained under this and other health statutes\" Title 1,(d)]. These mandates have required NIOSH to weigh its obligation to assure the highest degree of health protection for miners against the technical feasibility of the recommended standard in the development of recommendations for controlling radon progeny exposure in underground mines.\nThe control of exposure to radon progeny presents an unprecedented problem because of the ubiquitous yet variable nature of their presence in mines and the ambient environment. To complicate this matter further, recent reports indicate that an exposure-related health risk may exist at background exposure levels.\n contaminated with radon progeny.\nIn addition, this approach would not be a prudent community environmental public health measure in some situations because it involves releasing an additional burden of radon progeny to the ambient environment and thereby contributing to the background level in the immediate area of the mine. Thus ventilation cannot be used to totally eliminate exposure to radon progeny in mines.\nThe second point to consider in this dilemma is that the variable nature of radon progeny exposure in the ambient environment precludes recommending an annual cumulative exposure limit that includes both occupational and ambient contributions. Because ambient exposure varies, such a recommendation would result in an occupational exposure limit and associated risk that would vary with the locale. This approach is obviously undesirable, for it would lead to a nightmare of confusion and complicated enforcement requirements and would probably result in unequal protection of miners.\nData from both human and animal studies clearly demonstrate a direct link between lung cancer and radon exposure. Specific epidemiological studies provide a basis for quantitatively estimating human risk at various exposure levels. Such analyses clearly show that a radon exposure of 4 WLM (4 working level months) per year over a 30-year working lifetime (the current Mine Safety and Health Administration  standard) poses a significant and unacceprisk of lung cancer. This risk must be substantially reduced.\n the uncertainty of the data available on risk. Uncertainties are inherent in both the risk assessment methods and the scientific data on which the risk assessment is based. This fact must be understood and acknowledged. Some of the factors involved in these uncertainties include the choice of risk assessment method and model, the measurement methods used for data collection, and risk estimates derived from data that are heavily weighted with higher exposures.\nThe first of these factors in risk uncertainty involves the choice of a risk assessment method and/or model (such as the Cox proportional hazards model used in the NIOSH risk assessment study). NIOSH has attempted to develop a mathematical model that best describes the lung cancer risk in miners exposed to radon progeny. The use of a risk assessment model is merely a practical way to work with a very complex problem. There are modeling approaches other than the one chosen for this study. Each choice would result in a somewhat different description of the relationship between radon progeny exposure and lung cancer risk. NIOSH has attempted to compare the alternatives that are available and applicable. NIOSH scientists have considered the differences that might arise through a review of the available scientific literature and discussions with other scientists who have evaluated this exposure-related lung cancer risk.\nAlthough alternative models might yield minimally different quantitative risk estimates, none of them would lead the Institute to a qualitatively different risk assessment (i.e., that exposures to radon progeny at the current standard are associated with excesses of lung cancer).\nThe second factor involved in risk uncertainty is the measurement method used for data collection. This study involves a follow-up period of more than 35 years, more than 3,000 miners, and thousands of measurements. The older data are subject to greater uncertainty than the more recent data because of improvements in the entire measurement process over the course of the study.\nThe third factor involved in risk uncertainty is the process of generating risk estimates at lower exposure levels. One consideration is that such risk estimates are derived from data heavily weighted by higher exposures (note that the annual cumulative exposures of most miners in this study are higher than either the current MSHA standard or the proposed NIOSH recommended exposure limit ). Another consideration is the desirability of placing occupational risk in the context of background exposure risk. However, the latter has not been evaluated and would have to be estimated on the basis of occupational data. We therefore do not believe that it is currently possible to contrast these two types of risks. Nonetheless, EPA has generated some initial information on background exposure risk in A Citizen's Guide to Rad o n . This document indicates that action should be taken to lower radon progeny levels in homes with measured concentrations of 0.02 WL or greater. NIOSH estimates that this concentration would probably result in a cumulative exposure that is less than 1 WLM but within an order of magnitude of that value. New information is clearly needed on background exposure levels and the hazards associated with such exposure before occupational and nonoccupational risks can be reliably quantified and validly contrasted. Until these data are available, the final target exposure limits cannot be identified for control of this hazard in our total environment. The uncertainties in the data and a recent study commissioned by the Bureau of Mines on the feasibilities of controlling radon progeny levels in mines have been weighed along with the available evidence and the obligations of NIOSH. This process has resulted in an REL of 1 WLM per year. Our own quantitative risk assessment clearly shows that significant health risks are posed by an exposure level of 1 WLM per year over a 30-year working lifetime. NIOSH therefore regards this REL as an upper limit and further recommends that mine operators limit exposure to radon progeny to the lowest levels possible.\nIn addition, NIOSH wishes to emphasize that this recommended standard contains many important provisions in addition to the annual exposure limit. These include recommendations for limited work shift concentrations of radon progeny, sampling and analytical methods, recordkeeping, medical surveillance, posting of hazardous information, respiratory protection, worker education and notification, and sanitation. All of these recommendations help minimize risk.\nIn summary, NIOSH has the legislative, scientific, and public health responsibility to protect the health of miners by developing recommendations that eliminate or minimize occupational risks, recommended exposure limit of 1 WLM per year, I of the recommended standard fully satisfies the Although I am approving the do not feel that this part Institute's commitment to protect the health of all of the Nation's miners.\nFuture research may provide evidence of new and more effective methods for reducing occupational exposures to radon progeny, more reliable risk estimates at low exposure levels, and improved risk assessment methods.\nIf new information demonstrates that a lower exposure limit constitutes both prudent public health and a feasible engineering policy, NIOSH will revise its recommended standard.\n\n【1】 # I. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR A RADON PROGENY STANDARD\nThe National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) recommends that worker exposure to radon progeny in underground mines be controlled by compliance with this recommended standard, which is designed to protect the health of underground miners over a working lifetime of 30 years. Mine operators should regard the recommended exposure limit for radon progeny as the upper boundary for exposure; they should make every effort to limit radon progeny to the lowest possible concentrations. This recommended standard will be reviewed and revised as necessary.\n known as radon daughters) are the short-lived decay products of radon, an inert gas that is one of the natural decay products of uranium. The short-lived radon progeny (i.e., polonium-210, lead-214, bismuth-214, and polonium- are solids and exist in air as free ions or as ions attached to dust particles. The NIOSH recommended exposure limit (REL) is based on  evidence that a substantial risk of lung cancer is associated with an occupational exposure to radon progeny, and  the technical feasibility of reducing exposures.\nIn this document, NIOSH presents recommendations that will protect miners employed year-round at any mine work area for as long as 30 years (the period of time used by MSHA as a miner's working lifetime). The exposure limit contained in this recommended standard is measurable by techniques that are valid, reproducible, and available to industry and government agencies. NIOSH has concluded that current technology is sufficient to achieve compliance with the recommended standard.\nBecause knowledge of the carcinogenic process is incomplete and no data exist to demonstrate a safe level of exposure to carcinogens, NIOSH maintains that occupational exposure to carcinogens such as radon progeny should be reduced to the lowest level technically achievable. Compliance with this standard does not relieve mine operators from complying with other applicable standards.\n\n【2】 # S ection 1 -D e fin itio n s ( a ) Miner\nMiners include all mine personnel who are involved with any underground operation (e.g., drilling, blasting, haulage, and maintenance).\n\n【3】 # (b ) Working Level\nOne working level (WL) is any combination of short-lived radon progeny in 1 liter (L) of air that will ultimately release 1.3 x 10^ million electron volts (MeV) of alpha energy during decay to lead-210.\n\n【4】 # ( c ) Working Level Month\nA working level month (WLM) is the product of the radon progeny concentration in WL and the exposure duration in months.

The physician shall provide the mine operator and the miner with a written statement describing any medical conditions found during the preplacement or periodic medical examinations that may increase the miner's health risk when exposed to radon progeny. This written statement shall not reveal specific findings, but shall include any recommended limitations on the miner's exposure to radon progeny or ability to use respirators and other personal protective equipment.\n\n【12】 # (b ) Preplacement Medical Examination\nThe preplacement medical examination of each miner shall include the foI lowing:\n A comprehensive medical and work history (including smoking history) that emphasizes the identification of existing medical conditions and attempts to elicit information about previous occupational exposure to radon progeny.\n A thorough examination of the miner's respiratory system, including pulmonary function tests. The initial and subsequent pulmonary function tests shall include determination of forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV-j) using the current American Thoracic Society (ATS) recommendations on instrumentation, technician training, and interpretation.

Periodic chest X-rays are recommended for monitoring miners exposed to fibrogenic respiratory hazards (e.g., quartz). Ordinarily, chest X-rays may be obtained every 5 years for the first 15 years of employment and every 2 years thereafter, depending on the nature and intensity of exposures and their related health risks. A recent X-ray obtained for other purposes (e.g., upon hospitalization) may be substituted for the periodic X-ray if it is of accepquality.\n Other tests deemed appropriate by the physician.\n\n【14】 #  -Posting\nAll warning signs shall be printed in both English and the predominant language of non-Eng Iish-reading miners.

Since there is no typical mine and each operation has some unique features, the work practices and engineering controls in this section may need to be adapted for use in particular si tuat ions. Examples of effective ore extraction and handling procedures include the following: minimizing the number of ore faces simultaneously exposed, performing retreat mining toward intake air, limiting the underground storage and handling of ore, locating ore transfer points away from ventilation intakes, removing dust spilled from ore cars, minimizing ore spillage by maintaining roadways and carefully loading haulage vehicles, and covering ore until it is moved to the surface.\n(  B la s tin g\nBlasting should be performed at the end of the work shift whenever possible. Miners shall be evacuated from exhaust drifts until environmental sampling confirms that the average work shift concentration of radon progeny does not exceed 1/12 WL. Refer to  if respiratory protection is required for subsequent reentry.\n(  Worker R o tatio n\nThe mine operator shall not use the planned rotation of miners to maintain an individual's exposure below the REL of 1.0 WLM per year. NIOSH acknowledges, however, that some miners may inadvert ently be exposed to short-term high concentrations of radon progeny. For example, such exposures may occur when engineering controls fail. To ensure that the miners' cumulative exposure remains below the REL in such circumstances, it may be necessary to transfer them to other jobs or work areas that have lower concentra tions of radon progeny. Miners transferred under these circum stances shall retain their pay as prescribed for coal miners under (b) of the Federal Coal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977.\n\n【17】 # (b ) Engineering C o ntrols\nMechanical exhaust ventilation used alone or in combination with other engineering controls and work practices can effectively reduce exposures to radon progeny. Ventilation systems discharging outside the mine shall conform with applicable local, State, and Federal  air pollution regulations and shall not constitute a hazard to miners or to the general population.\n Ductwork shall be kept in good repair to maintain designed airflows. The effectiveness of mechanical ventilation systems shall be determined periodically and as soon as possible after any significant changes have been made in production or control. A log shall be kept showing designed airflow and the results of all airflow measurements.\n Fans shall be operated continuously in the work areas of an active mine and before the opening of a previously inactive mine or inactive section until environmental sampling confirms that the average work shift concentrations of radon progeny do not exceed 1/12 WL. Refer to  if respiratory protection is required.\n\n【18】  Fresh air shall be provided to miners in dead end areas near the working faces.\n Bulkheads, backfill, and sealants shall be used to control exposures as appropriate.\nIII provides a general discussion of engineering control methods.\nS ection 7 -R e s p ira to r S e le c tio n and C re d it fo r R e s p ira to r Use ( a ) General C onsiderations NIOSH has determined that a radon progeny exposure limit of 1.0 WLM per year is technically achievable in mines through the use of effective work practices and engineering controls. Over a 30-year working lifetime, this exposure limit will reduce but not eliminate the risk of lung cancer associated with exposure to radon progeny. NIOSH considers respirators to be one of the last options for worker protection. Work practices and engineering controls are more effective means for limiting exposures and providing a safe environment for all workers. Respirator use in underground mines is not always practical for a number of reasons, including the additional physiological burden and safety hazards they pose. NIOSH therefore recommends that engineering controls and work practices be used where technically achievable to control the exposure of miners to radon progeny.\nCompliance with an exposure limit of 1.0 WLM per year requires an average exposure of 1/12 WL throughout the year to ensure that the miner can work for an entire year (i.e., 2,040 hr). For average work shift concentrations above 1/12 WL, NIOSH recommends mandatory respirator use as well as the implementation of engineering controls and work practices to reduce exposure to radon progeny.\nOccupational exposure to radon progeny above background concentrations has been associated with excess lung cancer risk. Therefore, regardless of the exposure concentration, NIOSH advises the use of respirators to further reduce exposure and decrease the risk of lung cancer.\nRespiratory protection shall be used by miners  when work practices and engineering controls are not adequate to limit average work shift concentrations of radon progeny to 1/12 WL,  when entering a mine area where concentrations of radon progeny are unknown, or  during emergencies. Use only those respirators approved by NIOSH or the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA).\n\n【19】 # (b ) R e s p ira to r P ro te c tio n Program\nWhenever respirators are used, a complete respiratory protection program shall be instituted. This program must follow the recommendations contained in ANSI Z88.  (published by the American National Standards Institute) and the respirator-use criteria in 30 CFR 57.5005.\nThe respiratory protection program described in ANSI Z88.2-1969 requires the following:\n A written program for respiratory protection that contains standard operating procedures governing the selection and use of respi rators.\n Periodic worker training in the proper use and limitations of respi rators.\n Evaluation of working conditions in the mine.\n An estimate of anticipated exposure.\n An estimate of the physical stress that will be placed on the miner. A detailed medical examination of each miner shall be conducted according to the guidelines set forth in V.  Routine inspection, maintenance, disinfection, proper storage, and evaluation of respirators.  Information concerning the manufacturers' instructions for respirator fit-testing and proper use.\n\n【20】 # ( c ) R e s p ira to r S e le c tio n\nNIOSH makes the following recommendations for respirator selection:\n A respirator is not required for exposure to average work shift concentrations less than or equal to 1/12 WL.\n For exposure to average work shift concentrations greater than 1/12 WL, NIOSH recommends those respirators listed in -1.  For entry into areas where radon progeny concentrations are unknown or exceed 166 WL, or for emergency entry, NIOSH recommends only the most protective respirators (any full-facepiece, positive-pressure, self-contained breathing apparatus  or full-facepiece, positive-pressure, supplied-air respirator and SCBA combinat ion).\nThese recommendations are based on the fact that radon progeny exist as particulates and that miners are not exposed to hazardous concentrations of nonparticulate contaminants.\nIf protection against nonparticulate contaminants is required, different types of respirators must be selected.\n\n【21】 # (d ) C re d it fo r R e s p ira to r Use\nWhen respirators are worn properly, the miner's average work shift exposure can be reduced by a factor that depends on the class of respirator worn. -1 provides the credit factors for the various classes of respirators. For example, if a miner wears a helmet-type, powered, air-purifying respirator (PAPR) for 65% of the work shift and the radon progeny concentration in the work area is 0.3 WL, then the miner's exposure can be adjusted by dividing 0.3 WL by 2.7, the credit factor for this class of respirator. This results in an adjusted exposure of 0.11 WL for that miner.

Scope\n be carried into mines through groundwater containing dissolved radon . Radon gas may be inhaled and immediately exhaled without appreciably affecting the respiratory tissues. However, when attached or unattached radon progeny are inhaled, they may be deposited on the epithe lial tissues of the tracheobronchial airways. Alpha radiation may subse quently be emitted into those tissues from polonium-218 and polonium-214, thus posing a cancer risk to miners who inhale radon progeny.\nThis document presents the criteria and recommendations for an exposure standard that is intended to decrease the risk of lung cancer in miners occupationally exposed to short-lived, alpha-emitting decay products of radon (radon progeny) in underground mines. The REL for radon progeny applies only to the workplace and is not designed to protect the population at large. The REL is intended to  protect miners from the development of lung cancer,  be measurable by techniques that are valid, reproducible, and available to industry and government agencies, and  be technically ach i evabIe.\n\n【34】 # B. Current Standard\nMSHA has established radiation protection standards for workers in underground metal and nonmetal mines . This standard limits a miner's radon progeny exposure to a concentration of 1.0 WL and an annual cumulative exposure of 4 WLM. Each WLM is determined as a 173-hr cumulative, time-weighted exposure . Smoking is prohibited in all areas of a mine where radon progeny exposures must be determined; respiratory protection is required in areas where the concen tration of radon progeny exceeds 1.0 WL.\nAccording to current MSHA regulations, the exhaust air of underground mines must be sampled to determine the concentration of radon progeny.\n\n【35】 # Uran i um M ines\nIf the concentration of radon progeny in the exhaust air of a uranium mine exceeds 0.1 WL, samples representative of a miner's breathing zone must be taken at random times every 2 weeks in each work area (i.e., stopes, drift headings, travelways, haulageways, shops, stations, lunchrooms, or any other place where miners work, travel, or congregate).\nIf concentrations of radon progeny exceed 0.3 WL in a work area, sampling must be done weekly until the concentration has been reduced to 0.3 WL or less for 5 consecutive weeks. Uranium mine operators must calculate, record, and report to MSHA the radon progeny exposure of each underground miner. The records must include the miner's time in each work area and the radon progeny concentration measured in each of those areas.\n\n【36】 # Nonuranium Mines\nIf the concentration of radon progeny in the exhaust air of nonuranium mines exceeds 0.1 WL, and if concentrations are between 0.1 and 0.3 WL in an active working area, samples representative of a worker's breathing zone must be taken at least every 3 months at random times until the concentrations of radon progeny are less than 0.1 WL in that area. Samples must be taken annually thereafter.\nIf the concentration of radon progeny exceeds 0.3 WL in a working area, samples must be taken at least weekly until the concentration has been reduced to 0.3 WL or less for 5 consecutive weeks. Operators of nonuranium mines must calculate, record, and report to MSHA the radon progeny exposures of miners assigned to areas with concentrations of radon progeny exceeding 0.3 WL. The records must include the miner's time in each work area and the radon progeny concentration measured in each of those areas.\n\n【37】 # C. Uranium Decay S e ries\n-1 shows the sequence by which the most abundant isotope of uranium (238u) decays to a radioactively sisotope of lead (206pb). Radon (222Rn) is an inert gas with a radiologic half-life of 3.8 days; it is a product of the natural decay of radium (226Ra ). When radon decays, alpha particles and gamma radiation are emitted, and an isotope of polonium (218p ¡s formed. Polonium-218 (218p anc| j ts decay productslead-214 (214pb), bismuth-214 (214b ' i ), and polonium-214 (214p-are commonly referred to as short-lived radon progeny because they have half-lives of 27 minutes or less  . Both polonium-218 and polonium-214 emit alpha particles as they decay. The short-lived progeny are solids and exist in air as free ions (unattached progeny) or as ions adsorbed to dust particles (attached progeny).\n be carried into mines through groundwater containing dissolved radon . Radon may be inhaled and immediately exhaled without appreciably affecting the respiratory tissues. However, when the radon progeny (either attached or unattached) are inhaled, they may be deposited in the epithelial tissues of the tracheobronchial airways, where alpha radiation from polonium-218 and polonium-214 may be subsequently emitted. The quantity of mucus in those airways and the efficiency of its clearance (retrograde ciliary action) into the esophagus are important factors that affect the total radiation absorbed at a specific site within the respiratory tract.\n cause ionization in tissues, but they travel farther  through tissues and dissipate less energy per unit path length than do alpha particles . The beta parti cles and gamma radiation emitted by radon progeny make a negligible contri bution to the radiation dose in the lung .\n\n【38】 # D-U n its o f Measure\nThe common unit of radioactivity is the curie (Ci), which is the rate at which the atoms of a radioactive substance decay; 1 Ci equals 3.7 x 10^ disintegrations per second (dps). The picocurie (pCi) corresponds to 3.7 x 10~2 dps. The International System of Units (SI) unit of radio activity is the becquerel (Bq), which is equivalent to 1 dps. Therefore, 1 pCi is equivalent to 0.037 Bq.\nWhen radon gas and radon progeny are inhaled, the radiation exposure is primarily caused by the short-lived radon progeny (polonium-218, lead-214, bismuth-214, and polonium-214, which are deposited in the lung) rather than by the radon gas. Because it was not feasible to routinely measure the individual radon progeny, the U.S. Public Health Service introduced the concept of the working level, or WL . The WL unit represents the amount of alpha radiation emitted from the short-lived radon progeny. One WL is any combination of short-lived radon progeny in 1 liter (L) of air that will ultimately release 1.3 x 10^ million electron volts (MeV) of alpha energy during decay to lead-210. The SI unit of measure for potential alpha energy concentration is joules per cubic meter of air (J/m; 1 WL is equal to 2.08 x 10\"5 J/m3 ,\nThe equilibrium between radon gas and radon progeny must be known in order to convert units of radioactivity (Ci or Bq) to a potential alpha energy concentration (WL or J/m. The equilibrium factor (F) is defined as the ratio of the equilibrium-equivalent concentration of the short-lived radon progeny to the actual concentration of radon in air . When the equilibrium factor approaches 1.0, it means that the concentration of radon progeny is increasing relative to the concentration of radon. At complete radioactive equilibrium (F=1., the rate of radon progeny decay equals the rate at which the progeny are produced. Thus the radioactivity of the decay products equals the radioactivity of the radon .\nIn under ground mines, the equilibrium factor mainly depends on the ventilation rate and the aerosol concentration . Values of F ranging from 0.08 to 0.65 are typical in underground mines . Radioactivity and potential alpha energy concentration values at various equilibria are presented in -1. The common unit of measure for human exposure to radon progeny is the working level month (WLM). One WLM is defined as the exposure of a worker to radon progeny at a concentration of 1.0 WL for a working period of 1 month (170 hr).- The SI unit for WLM is joule-hour per cubic meter of air (J-h/m; 1 WLM is equal to 3.6 x 10-3 J-h/m3 . *Note that MSHA regulations are based on 173 hr per month. *F is defined as the quotient of the equilibrium-equivalent radon progeny activity divided by the radon activity.\nThe rad (radiation absorbed dose) is the unit of measure for the absorbed dose of ionizing radiation. One rad corresponds to the energy transfer of 6.24 x 107 MeV per gram of any absorbing material . The rem (roentgen equivalent man) is the unit of measure for the dose equivalent of any ionizing radiation in man. One rem is equivalent to one rad multiplied by a radiation quality factor (QF). The radiation QF expresses the relative effectiveness of radiation with differing Iinear-energy-transfer (LET) values to produce a given biological effect. The radiation QFs for beta particles and gamma radiation are each approximately 1; the radiation QF for alpha radiation varies from 10 to 20 .\nFor equal doses of absorbed radiation (rads), the dose equivalent (rems) attributed to alpha particles is 10 to 20 times greater than the dose equiva lent attributed to high-energy beta particles or gamma radiation. The SI unit of measure for the dose equivalent is the sievert (Sv). One rem is equal to 0.01 Sv .\n\n【39】 # E. Worker Exposure\nIn 1986, 22,499 workers were employed in 427 metal and nonmetal mines in the United States.\n decreased from 9,076 in 19799,076 in , and to 448 in 1986.\nII-2 shows the range in concentrations of airborne radon progeny measured in U.S. underground metal and nonmetal mines from 1976 through 1985 . As illustrated in 38 of the 254 operating underground nonuranium mines sampled during fiscal year 1985 contained concentrations of airborne radon progeny equal to or greater than 0.1 WL in   . With an estimated average of 55 workers per mine, approximately 2,090 nonuranium miners were at risk of exposure to radon progeny concentrations equal to or greater than 0. 1 WL in 1985. The gamma radiation exposures of U.S. uranium miners are generally regarded to be less than the whole-body occupational exposure limit of 5 rem (50 mSv) per year .\n\n【40】 # F. Measurement Methods fo r A irborne Radon Progeny\n\n【41】 # D escrip tio n o f Measurement Methods\n\n【42】 # a . Grab Samp I i ng Methods\nGrab sampling methods for measuring airborne radon progeny involve drawing a known volume of air through a filter and counting the alpha or beta radioactivity on the filter during or after sampling. Grab sampling methods used in underground mines are listed in II-5.\nIn one-count grab sampling methods such as those used with instant working-level monitors, the radioactivity is determined over a single counting period using a scintillation counter.\nIn two-count methods, the radioactivity is determined over two counting periods, and the ratio of these two measurements is used to calculate the radon progeny concentrations.\nIn a three-count method, radon progeny concentrations are derived from the relative changes in the measurements taken at three 30-minute intervals.\n important to prevent the accumulation of radionuclides to avoid contamination of the pump, counting equipment, and filters .\nStatistical uncertainties associated with the various grab sampling methods for radon progeny are presented in  Data indi cate that the relative precision of the methods is the same. The major differences are the total time period required for sampling and analysis, the capability of determining exposure concentrations at the work site, and the amount of routine maintenance and cali bration required of the instrumentation.\n\n【43】 # b. Continuous M onitoring Methods\nIn continuous monitoring methods, air is sampled continuously, and (as with other methods) the alpha or beta radioactivities are determined over the length of the collection period. Continuous monitoring devices and systems have been described elsewhere . The characteristics and statistical uncertainties for some continuous monitoring methods are presented in II-7.\nThe U.S. Bureau of Mines has designed an automated continuous monitoring system in which up to 768 detector stations can be linked to a central control unit. The system was designed to trigger an alarm when airborne radon progeny exceed a specified concentration . Although continuous monitoring methods can provide a rapid estimate of exposure concentrations, placement of the instrumentation in active work areas is difficult and may not always be representative of the exposure in the miner's breathing z o n e .\n\n【44】 # c . Personal Dosimeters\nPersonal dosimeters for radon progeny are intended to automatically record a miner's cumulative exposure regardless of fluctuations in radon progeny concentrations. Thus these devices eliminate the need to document work area location and occupancy time. Although several personal dosimeters have been tested in U.S. uranium mines, none are in routine use in this country because of problems in calibration and lack of precision .\n\n【45】 # . Pass i ve Dos i meters\nPassive dosimeters rely on the natural migration of attached and unattached radon progeny to the detection area of the device without the use of an air pump. Thin plastic foils sensitive to alpha particles are used as detectors. Although passive dosimeters using track etch foi Is have been studied in under ground mines , such devices are still in the developmental stage .\n\n【46】 # Act i ve Dos i meters\nActive dosimeters use a mechanical pump to draw a known volume of air through a filter. The alpha radiation emitted by the radon progeny collected on the filter is counted and recorded automatically. The following dosimeter detectors have been tested for use under mining conditions: thermoluminescent detectors , electronic detectors , and track etch detectors . Active track etch dosimeters are used for radiation monitoring in all underground mines in France .\n\n【47】 # d. Factors to Consider When S e le c tin g Measurement Methods\n been used in mines. Personal dosimeter methods are clearly more desirable, but they have not been rigorously tested in U.S. mines, and they have been reported to be unreliable for determining exposures over an 8-to 10-hr work shift . Continuous monitoring methods can rapidly detect changes in radon progeny concentrations and can be equipped with an alarm system that will be activated at preset concentrations. These monitors are often stationed at fixed locations within travelways, haulageways, shops, etc. because of the difficulty of moving and restationing them within active mine areas. Although these monitors do not usually provide adequate data for determining worker exposures, they can signal the occurrence of problems in the ventilation system and identify exposure sources.\nNIOSH believes that the use of instant working-level monitors or the Kusnetz count method will provide reliable estimates of exposure to radon progeny. Other methods at least equivalent in accuracy, precision, and sensitivity can be used  II -. Any method chosen must be capable of meeting the sampling strategy requirements described in IV.\n\n【48】 # G. R e s p ira to r S e le c tio n and C re d it fo r R e s p ira to r Use\n\n【49】 # . R e s p ira to r S e le c tio n\nHistorically, NIOSH has recommended the use of the most protective respirators- when workers are exposed to potential occupational carcinogens . Although cumulative exposure to radon progeny may result in cancer, the use of the most protective respirators may not always be technically feasible or safe in routine underground mining operations. Supplied-air respirators (SARs) that are NIOSH/MSHAcertified provide breathing air from compressors or a cascade system of air-supply tanks and are approved only for use with air lines less than 300 ft long. However, the use of SARs may not be practical in under ground mining operations. The reasons are that it is difficult to provide sufficient quantities of breathing air through air lines over long distances and that the air lines are susceptible to crimping and severing from the movement of mining vehicles and haulage cars on tracks. Furthermore, many underground work areas and passageways in mines are too small and cramped with equipment to accommodate air compressors or large air-supply tanks.\n cause increased physiological burden in the form of heat stress .\nFinally, NIOSH believes that the routine use of SCBAs and SARs may result in increased injuries in underground mining operations. NIOSH is not aware of any studies specifically dealing with injuries or other safety hazards associated with the use of SARs and SCBAs in mines. However, several studies have shown that obstacles introduced into the workplace result in a significantly increased risk of injury from tripping, slipping, or falling . Because mining is currently one of the most dangerous industries in the United States with regard to occupational deaths and injuries (MMWR 1987, BLS 1987, NIOSH believes that this problem would be exacerbated by the routine use of SCBAs and SARs.\nNIOSH believes that there is sufficient safety and health evidence to recommend against the routine use of SARs and SCBAs for reducing exposure to radon progeny during underground mining operations. -1 lists the respirators that NIOSH recommends for use against exposure to radon progeny. For average work shift concentrations of radon progeny that exceed 1/12 WL, the recommended respirators include air-purifying respirators with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters. The HEPA filter media are recommended by NIOSH for use with the air-purifying classes of respirators. These filters are the most *E i ther  any self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) equipped with a full facepiece and operated in a pressure-demand or other positive-pressure mode, or  any supplied-air respirator (SAR) equipped with a full face piece and operated in a pressure-demand or other positive-pressure mode in combination with an auxiliary SCBA operated in a pressure-demand or other positive-pressure mode.\nefficient type of particulate filter available, and they are less susceptible than others to performance degradation resulting from humid storage and use conditions .\n\n【50】 # . C re d it fo r R e s p ira to r Use\nA miner's exposure to radon progeny may be less than the average work shift concentration in an area, depending on the class of respirator worn and the percentage of time the respirator is worn properly. This reduced exposure for miners who wear respirators can be calculated by dividing the average work shift concentration of radon progeny by the credit factor (CF) for that class of respirator   -.\nThe credit factors in -1 were determined by the following equat ion:\nP- = 1/CF = Pw x tw + Pn x tn\nwhere Pf = the total penetration of radon progeny into the respirator facepiece.\nAPF = the assigned protection factor (a complete listing of the APFs for all classes of respirators can be found in the NIOSH Respirator Decision Logic ).\n\n【51】 # CF = the credi t factor\nPw = the penetration of radon progeny while wearing the respirator (i.e., 1/APF) tw = the proportion of time during the work shift that the miner wears the respirator properly Pn = the penetration of radon progeny while not wearing a respirator properly (i.e., 100% or 1. tn = the proportion of time during the work shift that the miner does not wear the respirator properly (i.e., 1.0 -tw )\nAn unpublished Canadian study evaluated the proportion of time during the work shift that a group of underground uranium miners properly wore their helmet-type, powered, air-purifying respirators  If a m i n e operator can verify to MSHA that respirator utilization is greater than 65%, NI0SH recommends a recalculation of the CFs using this higher utilization rate. However, the highest utilization rate that NIOSH recommends is 90%. The CFs for these extremes of utilization rates are listed in -1.\n\n【52】 # III. BASIS FOR THE RECOMMENDED STANDARD\n\n【53】 # A.

Statistically significant SMRs between 140% and 390% were observed in two other studies in which workers accumulated mean lifetime exposures below 100 WLM  and in preliminary findings of a third study in which workers accumulated estimated mean lifetime exposures below 100 WLM .\n\n【54】 # b. S y n e rg is tic E ffe c ts o f Other Substances\nAlthough the literature consistently demonstrates an association between lung cancer incidence and exposure to radon progeny, it is possible that some of the miners studied were exposed to other substances as well. These substances may have acted synergistically *The standardized mortality ratio (SMR) is the ratio of the mortality rates of two groups being compared. This ratio is expressed as a percentage and is usually adjusted for age or time differences between the two groups.\nwith radon progeny to potentiate the effects of the radon exposure.\n. Substances with synergistic potential include arsenic , hexavalent chromium, nickel, cobalt ; serpentine ; iron ore dust , and diesel exhaust .\nRisk analyses were performed on data from epidemiologic studies of U.S. uranium miners  and Swedish iron ore mine workers . These analyses indicate that the risk of mortality from lung cancer among miners who are exposed to radon progeny is greater among those who smoke cigarettes than those who do not smoke.\n\n【55】 # c. R e la tio n o f Lung Cancer Risk to Cumulative Radon Exposure\nSince completion of the NIOSH report I), Howe et a l .\n published a study of surface and underground mine workers who had worked in Canada in the Eldorado Lodge Uranium Mine between 1948 and 1980. That cohort included 8,487 workers.  Based on these stratified categories the risk of death from lung cancer increased linearly with increasing exposure. For the exposure categories of 5 to 24, 25 to 49, and 50 to 99 WLM, the relative risk was elevated, but the difference from the expected risk for an unexposed population was not statistically significant. For all exposure categories above 100 WLM, the relative risk was significantly elevated (p<0.; note, however, that the first 10 years of followup were excluded from this calculation. For the total cohort, the relative risk coefficient was 3.28% per WLM, and the absolute risk coefficient was 20.8 per 10 person-years per WLM (any excess mortality within the 10 years following initial exposure was excluded from this calculation).\n been reported. Pham et a l .\n studied 1,173 iron mine workers in France who were aged 35 to 55 and who had normal chest X-rays at the beginning of the study period in 1975. Thirteen mine workers who had worked underground for a mean of 25.2 years died of lung cancer between 1975 and 1980; only 3.7 deaths were expected from an age-standardized comparison with French males for this same period (SMR = 351; p<0.. Although exposure records were not available, the authors estimated that some workers may have received lifetime cumulative exposures to radon progeny in the range of 100 to 150 WLM.\nSo 11i  observed 318 niobium mine workers in Norway from 1953 through 1981; 77 of these miners were underground workers. This cohort experienced a total of 12 lung cancer deaths, though only 2.96 deaths were expected on the basis of age-specific rates for Norwegian males (SMR = 405; p<0.. The underground workers experienced 9 lung cancer deaths whereas only 0.81 were expected on the basis of age-specific rates for Norwegian males (SMR = 1,111; p<0.. From estimates of total exposure to alpha radiation (based on limited measurements of radon and thoron progeny taken in , the authors determined that the risk of lung cancer increased significantly (p<0. with increasing alpha radiation for the exposure categories of 1 to 19, 20 to 79, 80 to 119, and greater than or equal to 120 WLM. The excess absolute risk for those exposed workers was reported to be 50 per 10 person-years per WLM.\nThe epidemiologic studies of lung cancer mortality in mine workers exposed to radon progeny (including those studies discussed in I) are summarized in s III-2 and III-3.\n\n【56】 # An i maI Stud i es\na . E ffe c ts o f Exposure to Radon Progeny Chameaud  studied the effects of exposure to radon progeny in specific pathogen-free (SPF) Sprague-Dawley rats. A total of 1,800 rats were exposed to radon progeny for 1 to 3 hr per day for 14 to 82 days, yielding an accumulated exposure of 20 to 50 WLM. An additional 600 rats were unexposed. The lung cancer incidence in rats was reported to be directly proportional to their lifetime cumulative exposure to radon progeny. The authors con cluded that the amount of radiation needed to double the natural incidence of lung cancer in these rats was 20 WLM. Reduced life spans were not observed for rats in any of the exposure groups.\nb. R e la tio n o f Lung Cancer Incidence to Radon Progeny Exposure Chameaud  determined that the lifetime risk coefficient (uncorrected for life span shortening) for the induction of lung cancers in rats was approximately 140 to 850 x 10~ per WLM for exposures ranging from 20 to 4,500 WLM III -. This is consistent with the lifetime risk coefficient for lung cancer in humans (150 to 450 x 10\" per WLM) estimated by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) . As shown in MI-4, lung cancer incidence in rats increased as cumulative exposure to radon progeny increased. In contrast, the lifetime risk of lung cancer per unit of exposure (WLM) decreased with increasing exposure. These findings agree with those of the NI0SH risk assessment II), in which the lifetime cumulative risk of lung cancer per unit of exposure decreased as cumulative exposure increased in underground uranium mine workers.\n\n【57】 # c . S y n e rg is tic E ffe c ts o f C ig a r e tte Smoke\nChameaud et a l .  studied the ability of radon progeny to initiate lung cancer in groups of 50 SPF Sprague-Dawley rats that were subsequently exposed to cigarette smoke. The chamber concentrations of alpha radiation were 0, 300, and 3,000 WL; these concentrations yielded cumulative dose levels of 0, 100, 500, and 4,000 WLM, respectively, over a 2-month period for those groups of animals. Treatment groups were exposed to a total of 352 hr of cigarette smoke (9 cigarettes/500 L of air for 10 to 15 min per day, 4 days per week for 1 year. Exposure to radon progeny alone   demonstrated a directly proportional dose-effect relationship for induction of cancer (500 and 4,000 WLM). However, when a similar period of radon exposure was followed by exposure to cigarette smoke, a dose-related, twofold to fourfold increase occurred in lung cancer incidence. The authors stated that the groups receiving high and medium doses of radon and cigarettes had cancers that were not only larger but were more invasive and metastatic compared with the groups exposed to radon alone. Conversely, neither the cigarette smoke alone nor the low-dose radon progeny exposure (100 WLM) alone induced lung cancer.\nIn a parallel lifetime study, Chameaud et a l .  related the sequence of exposure to radon progeny and cigarette smoke to the incidence of lung tumors (cancer incidence was not specified) in groups of 50 SPF Sprague-Dawley rats. One group of rats was exposed to radon progeny only (a cumulative exposure of 4,000 WLM); a second group was exposed first to cigarette smoke and then to radon progeny .\nIn contrast, when the exposure to radon progeny preceded the exposure to cigarette smoke, the effect was potentiated-that is, 32 rats developed tumors. As stated previously, none of the rats exposed to cigarette smoke only developed lung cancer. No statistical analyses were performed on the results of this study.\n\n【58】 # d. S ig n ific a n c e o f Animal Studies\nLife span experiments in animals exposed to radon progeny alone have demonstrated that increasing exposures produce increasing incidences of lung cancer. This finding is similar to those of the epidemio logic studies cited in the preceding section (III, A, . Because epidemiologic data are available, these animal data contribute relatively little to the final assessment of risk in humans or to the determination of an REL for exposure to radon progeny. Thus this document discusses only selected animal studies of the carcin ogenic potential of radon progeny. Other studies have examined the sequential or concomitant exposures of rats, dogs, and hamsters to substances other than radon progeny (e.g., uranium ore dust, thorium, and tobacco smoke). Several additional studies (critiqued but not described in this document) confirm the adverse health effects of radon progeny on exposed animals . These animal studies generally confirm the risk of lung cancer reported among workers exposed to radon progeny.\n\n【59】 # B. Risk Assessment\nNIOSH studied the lung cancer risk of uranium miners by using data from a U.S. Public Health Service (USPHS) study  of white male uranium mine workers from the Colorado Plateau area (Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah).\nThat NIOSH risk assessment is described in a report entitled Quantitative Risk Assessment of Lung Cancer in U.S. Uranium Miners, which is reproduced in II. I contains a detailed discussion of the USPHS data.\nIn the NIOSH risk assessment, data were analyzed for 3,346 workers who had been followed from 1950 through 1982. By 1982, 1,215 workers had died; 256 of these deaths (21.1%) were due to lung cancer. A generalized version of the Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the relative risk of death resulting from lung cancer over a 30-year working lifetime at several cumulative exposure values.\n(The 30-year working lifetime was selected to maintain consistency with the working lifetime commonly described by MSHA.) Relative risk is defined as the ratio of lung cancer mortality in a selected exposed group to lung cancer mortality in a comparison group. The quantitative risk assessment model presented in II did not include the length of time since the end of the mining exposure, which is a significant predictor of relative risk. This term was subsequently added to the generalized Cox model, and new parameter estimates were computed. The estimates in s 111-5 and 111-6 are based on this model. The major difference between the two quantitative risk assessment models is that under the new model, the relative risk estimates increase more rapidly during exposure and decrease more rapidly after exposure.\nThe risk of death resulting from lung cancer increased with increasing lifetime cumulative exposure to radon progeny MI -; this finding is consistent with II. This direct relationship has been observed in previous epidemiologic studies . As shown in MI-5, the relative risk of 1.57 at 30 WLM corresponds to an average exposure of 1 WLM per year for a working lifetime of 30 years.   *Estimates are based on a log-relative risk model fitted to age at initial exposure, time since cessation of exposure, and the natural logarithms of the following variables: cumulative mining and background exposure to radon progeny; cumulative cigarette smoking and background smoking; and rate of exposure to radon progeny. +The approximate 95% confidence limits were calculated by applying the parameters from the quantitative risk assessment model together with their variances and covariances to the lung cancer mortality rates in the Colorado Plateau using an actuarial approach.\nIn addition to receiving workplace exposures to radon progeny, workers were assumed to have received average environmental exposures of 0.4 WLM/year. This is the value derived in the NIOSH risk assessment that led to the best fit of the model to the data. This assumed value is consistent with estimates of exposure to radon progeny for persons living near ore-bearing lands in the United States . The average nonoccupational exposure to radon progeny from natural geologic sources for persons in the United States is approximately 0.2 WLM/year .\nRelative risk modeling is common in the epidemiologic literature (especially in studies with lengthy followup) because the dramatic changes that occur in mortality rates with age and calendar year make absolute risk models extremely complicated. Most relative risk models assume that mortality rates in exposed populations are roughly proportional to the rates in unexposed populations at all ages and calendar periods. Because this assumption often approximates reality over a broad range of ages and calendar periods, the relative risk model can be expressed in a less complex form than absolute risk models (i.e., the relative risk model can be expressed without terms involving age and calendar year).\n II) to the lung cancer and all-causes mortality rates for white males in the Colorado Plateau States. Excess risk is defined as the arithmetic difference between the risk of lung cancer mortality in a selected exposed group and the risk of lung cancer mortality in an unexposed comparison group.\nThe estimated excess lung cancer deaths (i.e., excess lifetime risk) in -6 were computed by approximating the average of the exposuredetermined relative risk function over 5-year age intervals spanning an entire lifetime. These average relative risks and the corresponding mortality rates for lung cancer and for all causes of death among white males in the Colorado Plateau were used to compute the probability of lung cancer mortality during a lifetime using the National Academy of Sciences actuarial method .\nIt is important to understand the limitations of these risk estimates when examining the values in III-6. These limitations include the foIlowi n g :\n- A relatively small portion of the cohort had the observed lower levels of cumulative occupational exposure, and the ability to generate precise point-risk estimates at the lower range of occupational exposure is not as strong. Only 7% of the workers in the cohort had lifetime cumulative exposures below 30 WLM, and only 7 of the 256 lung cancer deaths occurred among workers with lower cumulative exposures.\n- The reliability of these excess lifetime risk estimates depends on  the accuracy of the original relative risk estimates and  the appropriateness of using lung cancer rates for the general white male population in the Colorado Plateau as an estimate of the background lung cancer rate (i.e., that which would occur in populations exposed only to background levels of radon progeny). This cohort contained no unexposed mine workers from which to estimate background lung cancer rates. Although certain limitations exist in using this type of rate , background lung cancer mortality rates from the general U.S. white male population were used to estimate the background rates for the cohort.\n- The background lung cancer rates were not corrected for cigarette smoking. However, the relative risk estimates used to calculate the lifetime risk estimates were adjusted for smoking. This implies that the lifetime risk estimates are only appropriate for a population with a pattern of smoking similar to that of the white male population of the Colorado Plateau.\nIn developing its recommendations, NIOSH has attempted to compare the risk of occupational exposure to radon progeny with the risk of background exposure in homes (i.e., exposure accruing outside the mining environment).\nThe estimated average background exposure to radon progeny is approximately 0. Given this value for background lung cancer risk, another question that must be considered is to what level it would be reasonable to control occupational risk.\nIn its benzene decision, the U.S. Supreme Court gave the following example as the basis for evaluating the occupational risk of chemically induced leukemia: An exposure associated with 1 excess death per million exposed persons might pose an acceprisk, whereas an exposure associated with 1 excess death per 1,000 exposed persons would pose a significant risk that should be reduced. This example is useful, but it cannot be strictly applied in all cases because it was offered as an illustration and not a fixed rule.\nIn the specific case of lung cancer risk associated with radon progeny exposure, the example cannot be strictly applied because the background risk of lung cancer is much greater than the risk of leukemia at background exposure levels and because cigarette smoking is known to create a confounding effect that greatly increases risk. An excess of 1 lung cancer death per 1,000 would probably not be detecin a general population if data were subject to considerable uncertainty, since it would necessitate differentiating between 46 and 45 deaths per 1,000.\nAnother important consideration is the technical feasibility of a given exposure limit. As stated earlier, NIOSH has determined that a cumulative exposure limit of 1 WLM per year is achievable (though some argue that it is not feasible on the basis of economics or current technology). NIOSH has found no evidence that any cumulative exposure lower than 1 WLM per year is feasible. As shown in III-6, the occupational exposure limit required to reduce expected lifetime risk to 1 excess lung cancer death per 1,000 miners is approximately 0.1 WLM per year. This cumulative exposure would require an occupational exposure concentration that is less than the concentration associated with a cumulative background exposure of 0.4 WLM per year, assuming background expoure is acquired outside the occupational environment. An occupational exposure limit of 0.1 WLM per year would therefore require average mine concentrations lower than the estimated background exposure concentrations.\nIn view of the preceding factors, the level of uncertainty in available data, and the apparent unfeasibility of limiting cumulative exposures to less than 1.0 WLM per year, it does not seem reasonable to recommend exposure limits that would yield only 1 excess lung cancer death per 1,000 miners.. NIOSH has determined that an exposure limit of 1 WLM is feasible in some mines and that such an exposure limit would substantially reduce risks from those associated with the current MSHA standard. An REL of 1 WLM per year is therefore recommended to substantially reduce risk and to stimulate the implementation and development of engineering and mining techniques to reduce exposure. The enforcement of this recommendation combined with additional health and developmental research may facilitate future exposure reductions and thereby reduce lung cancer risk.\n\n【60】 # C. Techn i caI Feas i b i I i ty\nIn a report to the U.S. Bureau of Mines, Bloomster et a l .  analyzed the technical feasibility of reducing the airborne concentrations of radon progeny in underground uranium mines. The study included data from 14 underground uranium mines operating during the study period (September 1981to May 1984. The authors concluded that some mines could operate at an annual exposure standard of 2 WLM by using dilution ventilation alone if it was introduced early in the development of the mine and if no contamination of inlet air was present. An extensive engineering analysis of 2 of the 14 mines indicated that it might be feasible to meet an operating standard of 1 WLM by using dilution ventilation in combination with other control methods such as bulkheading, air filtration, and use of sealants. The authors expressed doubt about the technical feasibility of operating these uranium mines at a standard of 0.5 WLM. III provides descriptions of engineering control methods that may be useful in underground mines.\n\n【61】 # D. Recommendati ons\nSeveral schemes exist for identifying and classifying a substance as a carcinogen. For example, the National Toxicology Program (NTP) , the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) , and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)  have all considered this problem. NIOSH considers the OSHA classification the most appropriate for use in identifying potential occupational carcinogens and supports the following definition:\nA \"potential occupational carcinogen\" is any substance, or combination or mixture of substances, which causes an increased incidence of benign and/or malignant neoplasms, or a substantial decrease in the latency period between exposure and onset of neoplasms in humans or in one or more experimental mammalian species as the result of any oral, respiratory, or dermal exposure, or any other exposure which results in the induction of tumors at a site other than the site of administration .\n includes any substance that mammals may potentially metabolize into one or more occupational carcinogens.\n developed lung cancer . Furthermore, the NIOSH risk assessment presented in II, which was based on the human studies, clearly demonstrates that a relationship exists between cumulative radon progeny exposure and the risk of developing lung cancer. The risk assessment shows that as cumulative exposure decreases, the risk of developing cancer decreases.\nIn arriving at an REL, NIOSH attempts to identify that exposure at which no worker will suffer material impairment of health or functional capacity.\nIn the case of radon progeny, this task is difficult because the NIOSH risk assessment shows that even with an exposure of 0.5 WLM per year (15 WLM for a 30-year cumulative exposure) or below, the risk of developing lung cancer increases  III-4 and II).\n consider the technical feasibility of the REL.\nIn previous NIOSH recommendations for the control of carcinogens, technical feasibility has often been interpreted as the ability to quantitate exposure; however, those recommendations were intended for use by nonmining industries where product substitution and engineering and process controls are generally more feasible.\nData from 1984 indicate that 94.4% of the workers in U.S. underground uranium mines accumulated annual radon progeny exposures of less than 2 WLM .\nInformation obtained from the Bureau of Mines  indicates that it is now technically feasible to achieve an annual radon progeny concentration of 1.0 WLM. NIOSH therefore recommends that cumulative exposure to radon progeny be limited to 1.0 WLM per year. This recommendation is intended to protect the health of America's underground miners, but it is tempered by the fact that currently it is not technically feasible to achieve annual exposures lower than 1.0 WLM using work practices and engineering controls.\nTo meet the NIOSH recommendation for an annual cumulative exposure of 1 WLM and to assure that mining is a viable year-long occupation, NIOSH believes that the daily average work shift concentration of radon progeny should not exceed 1/12 WL in any work area. Although adherence to the NIOSH REL will significantly reduce the risk of lung cancer in underground mine workers, it will not eliminate it.\nNo effective medical procedure currently exists to treat lung cancer caused by exposure to radon progeny. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that exposure to both radon progeny and tobacco smoke result in a combined lung cancer risk that is greater than the risk posed by radon progeny or smoke alone. Thus it should be noted that the interaction between radon progeny and smoking is at a minimum additive, and more likely multiplicative. Cigarette smoking should therefore be emphasized as an even greater detriment to mine workers exposed to radon progeny than it is to the general public. The implementation of smoking cessation programs should reduce the incidence of lung cancer in underground mine workers.\nBecause radon progeny are ubiquitous, exposure cannot be totally eliminated. For U.S. residents, the average annual nonoccupational exposure to radon progeny from natural geologic sources is approximately 0.2 WLM, and annual occupational exposures may be considerably higher. The REL of 1 WLM per year is not designed for the population at large, and no extrapolation is warranted beyond occupational exposures in underground metal or nonmetal mines. The REL is designed only for the radon progeny exposures of underground metal and nonmetal mine workers as applicable\n\n【62】 # IV. RESEARCH NEEDS\nThe following research is needed to further reduce the risk of lung cancer development from occupational exposure to radon progeny.\n\n【63】 # A. Epidem iologic S tudies\nNeeds for epidemiological studies have been identified as follows:\n- A need exists for a followup study of the U.S. miner cohort from the original Public Health Service study to explore the risk of lung cancer among nonsmoking miners exposed to low concentrations of radon progeny. NIOSH is currently resurveying this cohort to update exposure histories and gather additional information on smoking behavior, dietary practices, and tumor cell types.\n- A study is needed to determine whether radon gas itself or other contaminants that might be found in uranium mines are associated with increased morbidity and mortality.\n- An epidemiologic study of injuries is needed in the mining industry to identify safety-related problems, since this industry has one of the highest injury rates in the United States. Particular emphasis should be given to whether or not respirator use is associated with an increased injury and health risk. This investigation should examine slips, trips, falls, and heart attacks.\n\n【64】 # B. Engineering C o ntrols and Work P ra c tic e s\nResearch should be conducted to develop more effective control technology methods for reducing exposure to radon progeny to less than 1 WLM. A control technology assessment of the uranium mining industry will assist in this effort by examining existing state-of-the-art technologies and work practices and by recommending new methods for controlling exposure to radon progeny.\n\n【65】 # C. R e sp ira to ry P ro te c tio n\nThe following two types of research are recommended for respiratory protect ion:\n- Research should be conducted to determine the extent of gamma radiation emitted from particles trapped on high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters used on air-purifying respirators.\n be conducted to evaluate the physiological stress placed on miners who must wear respiratory protection. This study should be conducted both in the laboratory and in the mines.\n\n【66】 # D. Environmental (W orkplace) M onitoring\nStudies needed for environmental (workplace) monitoring are as follows:\n- Research should be conducted to characterize and evaluate the importance of particle size, unattached fraction, and condensation nuclei concentrations in estimating the bronchial dose of radon progeny. The dose of alpha radiation affecting the bronchial airways depends on the size of the particles to which it is attached. Recent studies have shown that as particle size decreases, the concentration of radon progeny increases.\n needed for more complete determination of a miner's daily exposure.\n\n【67】 # PUBLIC HEALTH PERSPECTIVE\n\n【68】 # V. PUBLIC HEALTH PERSPECTIVE\nIn developing this document, NIOSH has been challenged to carefully consider all of the Institute's legislative, scientific, and moral responsibilities. NIOSH has been required to review diverse scientific data that are subject to uncertainty and then, in keeping with its mandates, to recommend criteria that will attain the highest level of health protection and will at the same time account for other factors such as technical feasibility and insights gained through research and development.\nTo develop a public health perspective on the risk posed by occupational exposure to radon progeny, NIOSH must weigh a number of factors, as follows.\n1. Human and animal data both clearly establish that exposure to radon progeny increases the risk of lung cancer. The human data consist of a number of positive epidemiologic studies, several of which demonstrate an exposure-related health risk that is not accounted for by smoking behavior. The animal studies demonstrate that lung cancer risk increases with exposure in the absence of smoking.\nIt is important to note that smoking by miners appears to greatly exacerbate the risk of lung cancer posed by exposure to radon progeny alone.\n2. The NIOSH risk assessment, based on a USPHS study of uranium miners , demonstrated a significant exposure-response relationship. This analysis indicates that exposure to radon progeny at the current MSHA occupational exposure limit of 4 WLM over a working lifetime will result in 42 excess lung cancers per thousand miners. A miner's working lifetime has been defined as 30 years (MSHA uses 30 years as a miner's working lifetime). Risk declines substantially if a lower annual cumulative exposure is received over the working lifetime. Any risk assessment is subject to uncertainty because risk assessment models may not reflect risk in a completely reliable way and because the data on which they are based are subject to uncertainties and Iimitat ions.\nThe Cox proportional hazards model, which was chosen for the NIOSH risk assessment, is considered one of the strongest analytical approaches for longitudinal epidemiologic data. But it is not clear how accurately the data can be extrapolated to predict risk below the levels of observed exposure. Current biological theory hypothesizes that carcinogenic processes involve an initiation stage that is followed by other stages before an actual malignancy is established. The essential characteristics of all of these stages remain to be delineated. The Cox proportional hazards model is very powerful in describing human risks based on epidemiologic data.\nIts strength is partly due to the model's ability to accommodate long follow-up periods during which changes occur in some of the risk factors, e.g., cumulative exposure. Nevertheless, it is not clear how accurately the Cox model or any other risk assessment model predicts the risk from a multistage cancer process when exposures are below levels that have been studied.\nThe USPHS study  on which the NIOSH risk assessment was based is an extensive study, but the risk assessment is subject to uncertainties and limitations because of the nature of the data. For example, more uncertainty would be inherent in the risk estimates at the lower range of exposure because a relatively small proportion of this study population received the lowest cumulative exposures. Approximately 7% of the USPHS uranium miners (which included 7 lung cancers) had received cumulative occupational exposure levels of 30 WLM or less. At lower cumulative exposure levels, even smaller proportions of the cohort and fewer lung cancers were represented. Thus point estimates at these lower cumulative exposure levels would be more subject to the influence of chance occurrences.\nIn addition, exposure levels are subject to measurement error. The uncertainty of exposures have been estimated to range from a relative standard deviation of 38%  to as high as 97%  II).\n3. Radon progeny and its associated risk are present in our ambient environment as well as in the mining environment and cannot be totally eliminated. Radon progeny are ubiquitous in that they emanate from all ore-bearing deposits containing elements that decay to produce radon gas. The national average exposure to radon progeny has been estimated to be 0.2 WLM . Areas containing large amounts of ore-bearing deposits (e.g., the Colorado Plateau) are likely to have higher-than-average background levels of radon progeny . The NIOSH risk assessment uses a fitted estimate of 0.4 WLM as the background exposure (the average annual cumulative exposure incurred in nonoccupational environments) in the Colorado Plateau. Although no adequate measurement data are available to characterize the level and variability of exposure in the homes of the general population and of miners, it is clear that everyone is exposed and that the degree of exposure depends on each individual's home and work environment. The limits of concentration detection and the accuracy of the measurement techniques become a potential problem when quantifying the very low radon progeny exposure and concentration levels that may be found in the ambient environment (these levels are generally much lower than those found in underground mining environments). Extrapolation of risk to such low levels would become even more problematic than at higher levels because of the reduced accuracy of measuring such concentration levels. The elimination of radon progeny from the ambient and mining environments is not possible.\nThe primary engineering method for controlling radon progeny exposure is dilution ventilation. However, if radon progeny are ubiquitous in our ambient environment, no source of air is free of contamination. The only protective equipment that would eliminate exposure to radon progeny is the self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). SCBAs are unaccept able for wear in the ambient environment and represent a significant safety hazard if worn extensively in the mining environment.\nIt is valuable to compare the lung cancer risks associated with the miner's occupational and background exposures. No assessment has yet been made of the lung cancer risk associated with background exposures, either for the general U.S. population or for the population living in the Colorado Plateau. Until studies in homes are completed, it will be impossible to directly contrast the risks of occupational and background exposures.\nNonetheless, it is important to consider occupational risk in the context of the lung cancer risk experienced by the general population. On the basis of State vital statistics records, NIOSH estimates that the lifetime risk of lung cancer in the Colorado Plateau, uncorrected for smoking, is approximately 45 lung cancers per 1,000 white males. Unfortunately, accurate lung cancer rates are not available for nonsmokers in the Colorado Plateau.\nGiven this value for the lung cancer risk of background exposure, another question that must be considered is to what level it would be reasonable to control occupational risk.\nIn its benzene decision, the U.S. Supreme Court gave the following example for the basis of evaluating occupational risk of chemically induced leukemia. The example indicated that an exposure associated with 1 excess death per 1 million exposed persons might pose an acceprisk, whereas an exposure associated with 1 excess death per 1,000 exposed persons would pose a significant risk that should be reduced. This example is useful but it cannot be strictly applied in all cases, since it was offered as an illustration and not a fixed rule.\nIn the specific case of lung cancer risk associated with radon progeny exposure, the example cannot be strictly applied because the risk of lung cancer is much greater than the risk of leukemia at background exposure levels and because cigarette smoking is known to create a confounding effect that greatly increases risk. An excess of 1 lung cancer death per 1,000 would probably not be detecin a general population if the data were subject to considerable uncertainty, since it would necessitate differentiating between 46 and 45 deaths per 1,000.\n5. The technical feasibility of achieving lower exposure levels is subject to the limitations of available technology. A report commissioned by the Bureau of Mines [Bloomster 1984a, 1984b has been the primary source for NIOSH's assessment of the technical feasibility of lower exposure levels. On the basis of an extensive engineering analysis of two uranium mines, these investigators indicated that it might be feasible to meet an operating standard of 1 WLM using the best available engineering controls. They expressed doubt about the technical feasibility of operating these uranium mines at a standard of 0.5 WLM. This analysis has been used by NIOSH to define exposure limits that are technically achievable with the best available technology.\nThese are some of the issues that have been considered by NIOSH in developing a recommended standard to prevent lung cancer associated with exposure to radon progeny. This process of weighing risk from a public health perspective parallels the philosophy of risk presented in the 1985 document entitled Risk Assessment and Risk Management of Toxic Substances: A Report to the Secretary .\nIn the process of developing this public health perspective, NIOSH has performed the following actions:\n- NIOSH has identified a public health hazard posed by an occupational exposure. Exposure to radon progeny that occurs in underground mines and the ambient environment has been shown to cause a significant increase in lung cancer among uranium and other underground miners.\n- NIOSH has developed recommendations in a manner that is prudent and in concert with the public need. This process was accomplished by complying with the Institute's legislative mandates to attain the highest level of health protection and at the same time consider other factors such as technical feasibility.\n- NIOSH has sought appropriate public participation by eliciting external reviews. Reviews were requested from more than 60 individuals or groups, including industry, labor, academia, and government representatives. NIOSH has received and considered the comments from more than 30 of these reviewers.\n expressed risk as lifetime excess risk per 1,000 miners, an expression that can easily be interpreted by both experts and lay persons.\n- NIOSH has used all currently available information and the most extensive pertinent set of human data to estimate risk. The USPHS study of uranium miners  is the most extensive set of data available in the United States on the radon progeny exposure of underground miners. Unlike other analyses, this study used the entire qualifying cohort in the risk assessment, regardless of exposure level. These investigators felt this was the most valid way to analyze epidemiologic data using the selected model.\n- NIOSH has considered alternative recommendations for risk control that are based on viable exposure limits and engineering controls. The considered options ranged from proposing no REL to prohibiting all occupational exposure to radon progeny. The REL presented in this document was chosen after a thorough weighing of the available data and Institute mandates.\n suggested meaningful research areas such as lung cancer risks at low radon exposure levels, synergistic effects of other exposures such as cigarette smoke, effects of radon progeny on late versus early stage cancer, and the need for improved engineering control of exposure.\nAn extensive and complicated process has been used to develop the recommendations in this criteria document. After weighing the conclusions drawn from available data, the mandates of the Institute, and the public health issues, NIOSH recommends an annual cumulative exposure limit of no more than 1 WLM per year. However, as stated earlier, even this exposure poses a significant risk of lung cancer over a working lifetime. Thus NIOSH further recommends that mine operators regard this REL as an upper limit and that they make every effort to limit radon progeny to the lowest possible concentrations.\nIn addition, NIOSH wishes to emphasize the fact that this standard contains many important provisions in addition to the annual exposure limit. These include recommendations for limited work shift concentrations of radon progeny, sampling and analytical methods, recordkeeping, medical surveillance, posting of hazardous information, respiratory protection, worker education and notification, and sanitation. All of these recommendations help minimize risk.\nNIOSH recognizes its commitment to protect the health of the Nation's miners and will continue to reexamine this complex occupational health issue. Research on new and more effective methods for reducing occupational exposures will improve the available control technologies. Additional data on exposure levels and associated health risks will permit firmer estimates of risk and hence better recommendations. NIOSH will revise its recommended standard as important new data become available.\n\n【69】 # REFERENCES\n Unpublished report submitted to Mine Safety and Health Administration by Atomic Industrial Forum.\n Evaluation of recent developments in radon progeny measurements.\nIn: Gomez M, ed.

Health Phys 51:529-533  In fifteen epidemiologic studies, researchers reported excess lung cancer deaths among underground miners who worked in mines where radon progeny were present.\nIn addition, several studies show a dose-response relationship between radon progeny exposure and lung cancer mortality.\nIn two recent studies, investigators report excess lung cancer deaths due to mean cumulative radon progeny exposures below 100 Working Level Months (WLM) (specifically, at 40-90 WLM and 80 WLM).\nThe health risks from other exposures (i.e., arsenic, diesel exhaust, smoking, chromium, nickel, and radiation) in the mining environment can affect lung cancer risks due to radon progeny exposure. Unfortunately, the literature contains limited information about other exposures found in mines. The available information, concerning whether cigarette smoke and radon progeny exposures act together in an additive or multiplicative fashion is inconclusive; nevertheless, a combined exposure to radon progeny and cigarette smoke results in a higher risk than exposure to either one alone.\nX-ray surveillance and sputum cytology appear to be ineffective in the prevention of radon progeny-induced lung cancers in individual miners; therefore, these techniques are not recommended. Also, at this point, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that there is an association between one specific lung cancer cell type and radon progeny exposure.\nAccording to annual radon progeny exposure records from the Atomic Industrial Forum (AIF) and MSHA, it is technically feasible for the United States mining industry to meet a standard lower than the current annual exposure limit of 4 WLM. Recent engineering research suggests that it is technically feasible for mines to meet a standard as low as 1 WLM. Based upon qualitative analysis of these studies and public health policy, NIOSH recommends that the annual radon progeny permissible exposure limit (PEL) of 4 WLM be lowered. NIOSH wishes to withhold a recommendation for a specific PEL, until completion of a NIOSH quantitative risk assessment, which is now in progress.\n\n【70】 # II. INTRODUCTION\n discussed.\nA working level (WL) is a standard measure of the alpha radiation energy in air. This energy can result from the radioactive decay of radon (Rn- and thoron (Rn- gases. A WL is defined as any combination of short-lived radon decay products (polonium-218, lead-214, bismuth-214, polonium- per liter of air that will result in the emission of 1.3 X 10^ million electron volts (MeV) of alpha energy .\nNIOSH defines a WLM as an exposure to 1 WL for 170 hours.\nFor the information of the reader, two appendices and a glossary are included. A contains data from the Atomic Industrial Forum (AIF) an organization representing the interests of the United States uranium mining industry, and MSHA on the numbers and radon progeny exposures of underground miners in the United States. B lists methods currently in use for controlling radon progeny exposures underground.\nFinally, there is a glossary containing epidemiologic and health physics terms.\n\n【71】 # III. EVALUATI ON OF EPI DEM IOLOGIC EVIDENCE\n\n【72】 # A. In tro d u ct ion\nThis report examines five primary and ten secondary epidemiologic studies of underground miners. It describes the important points, strengths, and limitations of each study. The five primary epidemiologic studies examined lung cancer mortality among uranium miners in the United States, Czechoslovakia, and Ontario; iron miners in Malmberget, Sweden; and fluorspar miners in Newfoundland.\nThe ten secondary epidemiologic studies examined mortality among iron ore miners in Grangesberg, Gallivare, and Kiruna, Sweden; zinc-lead miners in Sweden; metal and Navajo uranium miners in the United States; tin and iron ore miners in Great Britain; uranium miners in France; and tin miners in Yunnan, China.\nFinally, two recent studies analyze the interaction between radon progeny exposure and smoking. This report focuses on the lung cancer experience of these fifteen underground mining cohorts.\nIn general, the study cohorts did not show excess mortality due to cancers other than lung, except for four studies that reported excess stomach cancers and one report of excess skin cancer among underground miners.\nExcess stomach cancers were reported among underground tin miners in Cornwall, England (standardized mortality ratio (SMR) = 200, p value unspecified by the authors, however estimated at p<0.05, from the observed deaths and the Poisson frequency distribution) ; gold miners in Ontario (SMR=148, p<0. ; metal miners in the United States (SMR=149, p<0. ; and iron ore miners in Sweden (SMR=189, p<0. . Sevcova   reported excess skin cancers among underground uranium miners in Czechoslovakia (an observed skin cancer incidence of 28.6 versus an expected of 6.3 per 10,000 workers; p<0., that they attributed to external alpha radiation from radon progeny. Arsenic is present in the Czechoslovakian uranium mines (arsenic levels unidentified)  and the association between arsenic and skin cancer is well documented . The excess mortality from stomach and skin cancers among these cohorts needs further study. In all five primary epidemiologic studies, the exposure records for the individual miners lack precision.\nFrequently, an individual miner's exposure was calculated from an annual average radon progeny exposure estimate for a particular mine or mine area, thus, an individual miner's true exposure could vary greatly from the estimated exposure. Of the five primary epidemiologic studies, the Czechoslovakian study has the best records for radon progeny exposure . The Swedish study has limited exposure records for their cohort (8 years of measurements for 44 years of follow-up), and the miners' mean exposures were about five WLM per year . The lower radon progeny concentrations found in Swedish mines indicate that the potential error due to excursions in concentration was less than in mines in the United States, Newfoundland, and Ontario, where higher concentrations were measured III-. Overall, the radon progeny exposure records from the United States, Ontario, and Newfoundland have similar limitations (detailed in sections B, D, and F). WL measurements made in uranium mines in the United States and fluorspar mines in Newfoundland fluctuated greatly, reaching unusually high radon progeny concentrations: in the fluorspar mines, a maximum of 200 WL , and in the uranium mines, 3 out of 1,700 mines averaged over 200 WL . NI0SH is currently investigating the variability and quality of the exposure records kept for uranium mines in the United States.\n evaluate the epidemiologic and statistical methods used.

Uranium Miners in the U nited S tates\n\n【74】 # . Descr i p t i on\nThe United States Public Health Services (USPHS) conducted an epidemiologic study examining mortality among underground uranium miners from the Colorado Plateau  Job turnover in the uranium mines was substantial; the majority of miners worked less than 10 years underground (not accounting for gaps in employment) . Nevertheless, approximately 33 percent of the cohort worked 10 or more years and 7 percent worked 20 or more years underground in uranium mines (not accounting for gaps in employment) . The number of months worked underground ranged from 1 to 370 (over 30 years), with a median of 48 months (4 years). Some miners worked underground in uranium or nonuranium mines before they entered the USPHS study, and before radon progeny levels were recorded. Among these miners, 13.7 percent started mining before 1947 . The cohort's early radon progeny exposures probably represented a small proportion of their total lifetime exposures; Lundin  noted that the study group accumulated only 16 percent of their total radon progeny exposure before 1950 .\nA bias toward overestimating exposure and a narrow sampling strategy were two major influences effecting the miners' exposure records. First, some of the USPHS exposure data records were biased by including disproportionately more measurements from mine areas with high radon progeny levels. Radon progeny samples taken during 1951-1960 were stated to be representative of the mine areas in which miners received exposures. Also, the U.S. Bureau of Mines (USBOM), the New Mexico State Health Department, and the Arizona mine inspector continued to take representative samples after 1960 . During 1960-68, however, additional radon progeny samples were collected for control purposes by mine inspectors from Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming .\n tended to increase estimates for geographic areas of mining (locality, district, or state) . Thus, some average annual WL exposure records collected during 1960-68 overestimated the uranium miners' exposure.\nSecond, there is little exposure data available for some uranium mines, especially small mines.\nFor the entire period 1951-68, nearly 43,000 measurements were available to characterize about 2,500 uranium mines. More samples were usually taken in the larger mines that employed most of the miners.\nIn many mines, however, only one or two samples were ever taken .\nAt the present time, the USPHS exposure data set has 34,120 \"average\"  annual WL exposure records from 1,706 surface and underground uranium mines, made over a 20-year period   . These records consist of \"guesstimates\", \"estimates\", \"extrapolations\", and actual WL measurements -1  used the formula for attriburisk to determine that about 80 percent of the deaths due to lung cancer in this cohort were attributo uranium mining . As of 1971, statistically significant excess cancers were found in all radon progeny exposure categories above 120 WLM ; the exposure categories were: less than 120, 120-359, 360-839, 840-1799, 1800-3719, and 3720 and over, in WLM. NIOSH continues to monitor the mortality experience of this cohort, particularly those workers exposed at or below 120 WLM. The terms \"guesstimates,\" \"estimates,\" and \"extrapolations\" were defined in this manner by Lundin  ; NIOSH recognizes the limitations of these definitions, but uses them for consistency with published reports.\n\n【75】 # Strengths\nThis is a large, well traced, and analyzed study; the study cohort is clearly defined. It contains smoking histories and radon progeny exposure records for the same individuals. Although the radon progeny exposure data were measured by different persons, a standard sampling and counting technique was used and the technical quality of the measurements was good .\n\n【76】 # . L im ita tio n s\nThe major limitation in the exposure data quality are that there were few measurements for small mines, (although fewer miners worked in these mines) miners' work histories were self reported, and many exposures were overestimated during 1960-68 . Another limitation is that many miners fell into high radon progeny exposure categories; however 20 pe-rcent of the miners were assigned to the category below 120 WLM .\nSeveral reviewers have found that the USPHS study gives lower estimates of risk per WLM for radon progeny exposure than the other four major epidemiologic studies . This may be due to the overestimation of exposure by Lundin   or other factors.\n\n【77】 # C. Uranium Miners in\n\n【78】 # Strengths\nOne positive feature of this study is the large amount of exposure data available.\nRadon gas measurements started in 1948, with a minimum mean of 101+8 measurements per mine . Other strengths include the number of workers exposed to low radon progeny levels, a long period of follow-up (average of 26 years by  , and the limited exposure to radon progeny from other underground mining (less than 2 percent of the study group members mined nonuranium ores) .\nIn addition, Sevc  investigated the hazards from other exposures, such as silica, arsenic, asbestos, chromium, nickel, and cobalt, and concluded that these were not causing the excess lung cancer risk of the uranium miners . Sevc  reported maximum dust levels between 2.0-10.0 mg/m3 during 1952-56, and stated that the miners' risk of silicosis was relatively low . Chromium, nickel, and cobalt were present only in trace amounts in mine dusts. Although arsenic was present in these mines (concentration unspecified), there was no significant difference in lung cancer mortality between two mining areas with comparable radon progeny exposure levels, but fiftyfold differences in arsenic concentrations .\n\n【79】 # Limitations\nThe limitations of the Czechoslovakian study are that the exposure estimates made before 1960 were based on radon gas, rather than direct radon progeny measurements.\nA second limitation is that the cohort definition and the epidemiologic methods used by the Czechoslovakian researchers make it difficult to compare their findings with those from the other four primary studies.\nThe radon gas and progeny equilibrium ratio is necessary to estimate WL concentrations from radon gas measurements correctly. The authors provided insufficient detail about the equilibrium ratio in the Czechoslovakian uranium mines to allow evaluation of the data quality .\nIf Sevc  had equilibrium ratio records or a reliable way to estimate the equilibrium ratio, then using radon gas exposure measurements to estimate WL would not seriously bias their results.\nSevc, Kunz and associates defined their cohort as men who entered employment in the Czechoslovakian uranium mines in the years 1948-1953 (for Group A miners), and worked underground at least 4 years .\nIt is unclear from the published reports whether the Czechoslovakian miners accumulated their person-years at risk of dying (PYR) from the time they entered the cohort or from their time of first exposure. The cohorts' average 26 years of follow-up by 1975 , implies that the PYR were accumulated from a miner's time of first exposure .\n neglected the effect of smoking in their data analysis, although they stated that this would not effect their results, because the percentage of cigarette smokers among miners (70 percent) was comparable to that among the general male population of Czechoslovakia .\n\n【80】 # D. Uranium\n\n【81】 # Strengths\nThis study's greatest strength lies in the miners' low mean cumulative exposures (40-90 WLM) to radon progeny, exposures much lower than those reported in the United States, Czechoslovakian, and Newfoundland studies  III-2, at the end of this Chapter). Another good feature of this study is that the researchers carefully traced uranium miners' work experience in other hard rock mines.\nLarge numbers of uranium miners in Ontario (66 percent of the study cohort) had some hard rock mining experience.\n\n【82】 # . L im ita tio n s\nThis study has three disadvantages; first, the cohort is severely truncated, with only about 18 years (median value) of follow-up and a median attained age of 39 years by 1977 . A short follow-up on a young cohort creates problems because lung cancer is rarely manifested before age 40 . Second, thoron progeny and gamma radiation levels vary and can reach substantial levels In some Ontario uranium mines . For example, Cote and Townsend  found that thoron progeny working levels were about half the radon progeny working levels in an Elliot Lake, Ontario uranium mine . The Kusnetz method is frequently used to measure radon progeny in mines and can discriminate between radon and thoron progeny. When used improperly, however, the Kusnetz method can mistakenly count thoron progeny as radon progeny, so that the true radon progeny exposure may be overestimated . From the limited information in the published reports , it is unclear whether measurement error was introduced by using the Kusnetz method improperly.\nThere are no epidemiologic data available to estimate the health risks due to thoron progeny. The Advisory Committee on Radiological Protection from the Canadian Atomic Energy Control Board (AECB) reviewed research on microdosimetry which indicated that the main contribution to the WLM from thoron progeny comes from the radioactive decay of long-lived Pb-212 (ThB, the half life=10.6 hours).\nIts half-life is long enough for the Pb-212 to translocate from the lungs into other tissue, where it emits much of its alpha energy. Radon progeny have shorter half-lives than Pb-212 and emit most of their alpha energy in the lung. Therefore, the AECB concluded that the risk of lung cancer induction by 1 WLM of thoron progeny is about one third of that for 1 WLM of radon progeny .\nFinally, Muller  published limited information about the smoking habits of these miners, and the researchers' present risk estimates are uncorrected for smoking . Out of a group of 57 uranium miners who died of lung cancer, only one was a nonsmoker and the rest smoked . Muller and associates plan to conduct a case-control study of the effects of smoking upon lung cancer risk in miners. Although they stated that correction for smoking will not substantially change their risk estimates , at low levels of radon progeny exposure, it is important to take into account the effect of smoking; thus, definitive conclusions regarding this study must await the smoking history analysis.\n\n【83】 # E. Iron Miners in\n\n【84】 # Strengths\nThe strengths of this study include the relatively low radon progeny exposures of the miners (mean of 4.8 WLM per year), the long follow-up period, and the stability of the work force. The ascertainment of vital status (99.5 percent), and the confirmation of diagnoses for causes of death was thorough (about 50 percent of all deaths in Sweden are followed by autopsy).\nIn addition, Radford and St. Clair Renard  used case-control methods and environmental measurements to rule out health risks from diesel exhaust, iron ore dust, silica, arsenic, chromium, nickel, and asbestos in the mines .\n\n【85】 # . L im ita tio n s\n a question about how the authors adjusted for lung cancer latency. Radon gas, in the Swedish iron mines, was first measured in 1968. That means that for the average 44 years of follow-up, there exist exposure estimates based on actual measurements for only 8 years. The researchers reconstructed past concentrations based on measurements made at each mine level and area during 1968-1972 and on knowledge of the natural and mechanical ventilation used previously.\nThey assumed that mine ventilation systems and radon progeny concentrations during 1968-72 were comparable with those in the past, by analogy with quartz dust levels measured in the mines since the 1930's .\nThe researchers calculated average yearly exposures in WLM for each decade from the average hours per month underground and radon progeny concentrations in each area, weighted by the number of man-hours worked underground . These crude calculations make tenuous the connection between a given individual miner and a particular radon progeny exposure level. Nonetheless, the iron miners as a group, probably received very low average exposures to radon progeny compared to uranium miners . Radford et a I., stated : \"\\.we consider that average exposures are probably accurate to + 30 percent\" ;\nthus, the true average exposure could be between 56 and 104 WLM.\nExactly how Radford and St. Clair Renard defined the cohort, and calculated or excluded the PYR, was unclear from the article.\n\n【86】 It is assumed that most of the miners' PYR were excluded from the years prior to 1951, rather than the period 1951-1976 (years when the authors analyzed mortality), and that the mining population was s If one makes these assumptions (unstated by the authors), then adjusting for latency by excluding PYR during the first 10 years after the start of mining should produce unbiased SMR calculations. On the other hand, adjustments for latency that incorrectly exclude many PYR lower the expected number of deaths, thereby possibly overestimating the SMR and the risk due to radon progeny. Because of insufficient information, NIOSH is unable to completely evaluate the effect of the 10-year adjustment for latency on the SMR in this study, although it appears to be minor.\n\n【87】 # F. Fluorspar Miners in\n\n【88】 # Strengths\nOne strength of this study was the long follow-up period; workers were followed for an average of about 30 years of observation . Also, the researchers obtained smoking history data for 41 percent of the cohort .\n\n【89】 # . L im ita tio n s\nThere were three principle limitations in this study. First, there was limited exposure data available before 1968 (.\nSecond, the study failed to trace large numbers of workers; 591 workers who lacked adequate personal identifying information (name and year of birth) were dropped from the analysis.\nThird, this study lacks an adequate basis for estimating expected deaths.\nLung cancer rate comparisons between the mining population, with its many smokers, and the Newfoundland or Canadian national populations, would exaggerate excess deaths due to radon progeny exposure. Morrison  tried to avoid this problem by generating the expected number of deaths among underground workers from a comparison with mortality rates among surface workers (adjusted for age, time period, and disease specific mortality) . A problem with this study design is that the control group may be exposed to radon progeny. Some of the men classified as surface workers (controls) may have received some radiation exposure, by means of either misclassification or unrecorded short periods of working underground. Also, it is difficult to correctly adjust for age, time period, and disease specific mortality, when there are proportionately fewer workers in the control group (surface workers) than in the exposed group (as of 1971, underground workers accounted for 57 percent of the total person-years ). The lack of an adequate comparison group is a serious limitation, so risk estimates from this study must be viewed wi th caut ion.\n\n【90】 # G. Secondary Epidem iologic Studies\nThe ten epidemiologic studies reviewed herein examine mortality among miner populations in China, Sweden, the United States, Great Britain, France, and China.\nSeveral studies demonstrated elevated radon progeny levels and excess lung cancer deaths among underground miners, but lacked information about radon progeny exposure, or levels of other mine carcinogens.\n restricted their usefulness. Overall, the ten secondary studies provide additional information about the association between lung cancer mortality and radon progeny exposure, yet have more limitations (in study design, study population size, radon exposure records, thoroughness of followup, etc.) than the five primary studies. To be concise, the secondary studies are described in less detail than the primary studies.\nIron Ore Miners in Grangesberg, Sweden\n\n【91】 # Zinc-Lead M iners in Sweden\nThis case referent study examined lung cancer mortality during 1956-76 among residents from the parish of Hammar, Sweden, an area with two zinc-lead mines . Twenty-nine subjects who died of lung cancer, including 21 who were underground miners, were matched with three referents who died before or after each case. Some problems with the study were the smalI number of cases and a fai lure to match for age or smoking status. Axelson and Sundell  reported a sixteenfold increase (p<0. in lung cancer mortality among the miners versus nonminers. Although they lacked individual information on exposure, they estimated a radon progeny level of about 1 WL in the mines, based on measurements made in the 1970's . These results should be viewed with caution; since they demonstrated that age was a confounding factor, yet they did not match cases and referents for age.\n\n【92】 # . Iron Ore Miners in K iruna, Sweden\nThis study examined lung cancer mortality among residents of the Kiruna parish in Northern Sweden, an area containing two underground iron mines . One strength of this study is that migration in the Kiruna area was slight, therefore, nearly all former miners' deaths were registered in Kiruna. From 1950 to 1970 a total of 41 men (in Kiruna) between the ages of 30-74 years died of lung cancer. Thirteen of these were underground miners, and it is possible, although unclear in the report, that 18 were surface workers. One limitation of this study is that the the age distribution of underground miners was unrecorded, and therefore, proportional mortality was used instead of the lifemethod to calculate the expected mortality. Another limitation is that the expected mortality was not adjusted for smoking status, since information from family and fellow workers indicated that 12 of the 13 underground miners smoked (8 smoked cigarettes, 4 smoked pipes). Jorgensen  compared the 13 deaths observed among underground miners with expected deaths of 4.47, based on local rates, and 4.21, based on Swedish national rates.\nIn both cases, he reported significantly elevated mortality (p<0. among the underground miners . Because this proportional mortality study involved few lung cancer cases, 13 for underground miners and 28 for all other men in Kiruna, the results should be viewed with caution. Radon progeny exposure records were unavailable for the underground miners, however, there were measurements of 10-100 pCi/l radon progeny (about 0.10-1.0 WL at 100 percent equilibrium).\nIro n Ore Miners in Kiruna and G a lliv a r e , Sweden\n\n【93】 # . Metal Miners in the U nited S tates\n\n【94】 # T in M iners in C o rn w all, Great B r ita in\n\n【95】 # Uranium Miners in France\nIn 1956, 7,470 radon gas measurements were collected.\nFrom 1957 to 1970, about 20-30 radon gas measurements were collected per miner per year; from 1970 to the present, 57-70 per miner, per year. The only limitation of these records is that they are based on radon gas, rather than direct radon progeny measurements. At present, the mean factor of equilibrium in the French mines is 0.22. The miners' average annual radon progeny exposures varied from 2.5 to 4. There were many excess lung cancers at low radon progeny exposures, i.e., an SMR of 436 (p value unspecified by the authors, however estimated at p<0.05, from the number of observed deaths and the Poisson frequency distribution) at cumulative exposures below 140 WLM. Arsenic concentrations in ore samples were high, 1.50-3.53 percent . For the years 1950-59, it was estimated that a miner inhaled 1.99-7.43 mg arsenic per year . The authors suggested that the high arsenic content in the ore samples may cause lung cancer .\n, whether the 12,243 miners worked between 1975-81 or constituted all tin miners who ever worked underground. The major limitation appears when comparing these studies with other mining research studies because Wang and associates handled radon progeny measurement techniques and epidemiologic methods in a different manner. For instance, they did not mention if their mortality statistics were adjusted for age or smoking status. Their comparison population, male residents in urban Shanghai municipality, has much higher lung cancer rates than males in rural Yunnan province . Therefore, the Shanghai comparison group was inappropriate and may have underestimated these miners' lung cancer r i sks.\nAnother limitation is that arsenic exposure has been associated with lung cancer among copper smelter and pesticide workers . This research may be most useful for studying the interaction of two carcinogens, arsenic and alpha radiation from radon progeny, rather than for studying radon progeny lung cancer risks alone.\n\n【96】 # H. Smoking\nThe two most thorough studies of the interaction between smoking and radon progeny exposure are those by Whittemore and McMillan , using the U.S. white uranium miners data set , and by Radford and St. Clair Renard  using the Swedish iron miners data set . The major flaw in other studies of the interaction between smoking and radon progeny exposure  is an inadequate sample size of miners with both exposure records and smoking histories.\n\n【97】 # . Uranium Miners in th e U nited S tates\n\n【98】 B).\nFor each case, four control subjects were randomly selected from among those white miners born within 8 months of the case and known to survive him, yielding a total of 776 matched controls . A regression analysis of the radon progeny exposure and smoking data for cases and controls revealed that the data fit a multiplicative linear relative risk model , but showed \"significantly poor fit\" (p<0. for the additive linear relative risk model  . The data demonstrated a synergistic effect, that is, the combined action of smoking and radon progeny was greater than the sum of the actions of each separately. .\n\n【99】 # Whittemore and McMillan, based on the multiplicative linear relative risk model , suggested that miners who have smoked 20 pack-years of cigarettes (excluding tobacco use within the past 10 years) experience radiat ion-induced lung cancer rates per WLM that are roughly five times those of nonsmoking miners\n(They estimated that B-j, the excess relative risk per unit of radon progeny, was 0.31X10~2 and B2 , the excess relative risk per unit of cigarette smoke exposure, was 0.51X.\nIron Miners from Malmberget, Sweden\n\n【100】 # . Conclusions R elated to th e In te ra c tio n o f Radon Progeny Exposure and Smoking\nStudies of white uranium miners in the United States , and iron miners in Sweden , support different models of risk due to radon progeny and smoking; the first supports a multiplicative model, the second, an additive model. These two studies arrive at different conclusions which is not surprising, given the differences in statistical methods, cumulative exposure levels (the averages differed by a factor of , smoking histories, and method of calculating expected deaths between the studies. Based on the presently available information, it is impossible to conclude whether the additive or multiplicative model is the best. Nevertheless, present research indicates a higher risk from combined exposure; data from both radiation exposure and smoking histories are essential for an accurate estimation of radiogenic lung cancer risks.\n\n【101】 # I . Discussion and Conclusions R elated to the Epidem iologic E valu atio n 1. The Five Prim ary Epidem iologic S tudies\nThe five primary epidemiologic studies that examine lung cancer mortality among underground miners are the studies of uranium miners in the United States, Czechoslovakia, and Ontario, as well as iron miners in Sweden and fluorspar miners in Newfoundland.\nDespite the individual limitations of each study, the association of radon progeny exposure and lung cancer was shown to persist for all five studies, using different study populations and methodologies.\nThere was an elevated lung cancer SMR and a dose-response relationship for radon progeny exposure and lung cancer among the five underground miners' cohorts; the higher the estimated radon progeny exposure, the greater the number of excess deaths. Some studies  adjusted their mortality s for the estimated latency of radiogenic lung cancer, yet the association between lung cancer cases and radon progeny exposure remained.\nIII-2 is a summary of the observed and expected deaths and the SMR's in the five studies. These studies handled adjustments for latency, lagging dose, smoking history, or age as detailed in the footnotes in III-2. As yet, there is no one standard method to adjust person-years, expected deaths, or SMR's, or even agreement that these parameters should be adjusted.\nA M five studies  lacked adequate radon progeny exposure data for individuals because, in general, these data were originally collected for monitoring, and not research purposes.\nIn addition, some studies  based the exposure assessment upon radon gas measurements, which must be converted to radon progeny estimates.  five studies, rather than eliminate a particular study because of exposure data quality.\n\n【102】 # It is reasonable, however, to extract what information is available from these\nThe primary studies of iron miners in Sweden and uranium miners in Czechoslovakia searched for other exposures  (i.e., mineral ores, radiation, diesel fumes) in the mining environment.\nThe Czechoslovakian uranium mines contained various amounts of arsenic, but only trace amounts of chromium, nickel, and arsenic . Researchers examined lung cancer mortality in two uranium mining localities that had similar radon progeny levels, but a fiftyfold difference in arsenic concentrations.\nThey failed to find a significant difference in mortality between the two groups of miners , concluding that arsenic was not affecting the lung cancer rates of underground miners in Czechoslovakia. Arsenic, chromium and nickel were essentially absent in the Swedish iron mines. There were occasional inclusions of serpentine, but no identifiable asbestos fibers in dust samples . The Swedish iron mines contained iron ore dust, but Stokinger , after review of the literature from health reports involving underground iron ore miners, iron and steel workers, foundrymen, welders, workers in the magnetic tape industry, and others, concluded that these studies failed to clearly demonstrate the carcinogenicity of iron oxide dust .\nThe influence of other types of radiation present in the mines, such as long-lived alpha, beta, and gamma radiations, cannot be determined from these five studies. The miners do not show an excess mortality from leukemia, a disease linked to high gamma radiation exposures . Most of the studies provided insufficient information about diesel fume exposures in the mines, so that it is impossible to reach conclusions regarding the effect of diesel fume exposure upon lung cancer risk.\nIn the Swedish iron mines, 70 percent of miners with lung cancer left underground work or died before diesel equipment was introduced in the 1960's ; the remaining miners had brief diesel fume exposures immediately before death . Therefore, diesel fume exposure could not account for the excess mortality in the Swedish cohort . Cigarette smoke appears to be the most important carcinogen common to the five primary studies. The proportion of cigarette smokers among underground miners in the United States, Newfoundland and Sweden was greater than among the general male population in those countries . The influence of possible carcinogens in mines (in addition to radon progeny) upon lung cancer mortality needs further research.\n\n【103】 # . The Ten Secondary Epidem iologic Studies\n found arsenic in the mines; Wang  suggested that the high arsenic content of the ore may be a cause of lung cancer . The study of tin miners in China found an exposure-response relationship between cumulative radon progeny exposure and excess lung cancer mortality, but at the lowest exposure level (less than 140 WLM), still found an unusually high SMR  . The arsenic exposures of these underground miners may contribute to the high lung cancer SMR; arsenic exposure is associated with lung cancer in copper smelter and arsenical pesticide workers .\nThe study of iron ore miners in Grangesberg, Sweden estimated an attriburisk of 30-40 cases per 10 PY-WLM for miners over the age of 50 . This attriburisk estimate is comparable to that reported by Radford and St. Clair Renard  for miners in Malmberget, Sweden in the same age group .\n\n【104】 # The Lowest Cumulative Radon Progeny Exposures Associated w ith Excess Lung Cancer M o r ta lity\nThe five primary epidemiologic studies are far from completion, since the cohorts' follow-ups are truncated.\nFor example, the uranium miners in the United States were followed a mean of 19 years (by , while the iron miners in Sweden were followed a mean of 44 years (the Swedish study has the longest follow-up period of the five primary studies). Lung cancer rarely is manifested before age 40, regardless of etiology .\nFrequently, the initial analyses performed on a cohort lack enough PYR and statistical power to show a statistically significant association between excess lung cancer mortality and low radon progeny exposure levels. Later analyses accumulate additional PYR for the entire cohort and specific subgroups, increasing the ability to detect an effect due to radon progeny. This point is important when determining the lowest radon progeny exposures associated with excess lung cancers. A longer follow-up period, resulting in more PYR and statistical power in a study, may reveal an association between excess lung cancer mortality and radon progeny at lower cumulative exposures.  had an average of about 10 years of follow-up (by  and found excess cancers above 120 WLM. The study of uranium miners in Czechoslovakia found excess mortality above 100 WLM . Two recent studies, of miners in Ontario and Sweden, reported excess cancers at cumulative radon progeny exposure levels of 40-90 WLM and 80 WLM, respectively . Thus, two epidemiologic studies found excess lung cancer mortality associated with radon progeny exposure levels below 100 WLM.\n\n【105】 # The study of uranium miners in the United States by Lundin et al . \nIn addition, studies suggest that both radon progeny exposure and smoking are involved in the lung cancer mortality of underground miners; however, the available information does not allow one to state whether radon progeny and smoking interact in an additive or multiplicative fashion . One estimate is that miners who smoked 20 pack-years of cigarettes have radiat ion-induced lung cancer rates per WLM that are roughly five times those of nonsmoking miners .\nFinally, the five primary and ten secondary mining epidemiologic studies all demonstrate excess lung cancer mortality among underground miners working in the presence of radon progeny.\n\n【106】 # IV .

Screening and Lung Cancer Prevention\nAlpha radiat ion-induced lung cancer may be preven(by limiting exposures to radon and thoron progeny) but not trea By the time radiogenic lung cancer is detected among individuals in an exposed work force by routine periodic screening, the affected workers fail to benefit from any further preventive or therapeutic measures.\n\n【109】 # Available screening tests may detect radiat ion-induced, premalignant abnormalities in asymptomatic exposed workers years before disease appears. At the current state of knowledge, however, it is unknown whether medical removal of asymptomatic workers with these abnormalities will prevent progression to malignant disease. A recent study by NIOSH tested the within-reader reliability of an expert in sputum cytologic and histopathology. The reader reliably detected malignant changes, but frequently read early changes as \"premalignant\" on one occasion and as \"within normal limits\" on other occasions .\nTo date, there is no convincing evidence that routine periodic medical screening of workers exposed to pulmonary carcinogens is an effective means of prevention of mortality due to lung cancer in these workers.\nCoke oven workers are presently the only group of workers covered by a mandatory rule for periodic screening by sputum cytology and chest X-rays. Although the effectiveness of that regulation has not yet been evaluated, such studies are now underway.\nIn addition, NIOSH is currently collecting data on lung cancer rates and the results of sputum cytologic tests for some miners in the USPHS cohort . Also, frequent exposures of underground miners to chest X-rays for screening purposes are not recommended at present.\n\n【110】 # CRITERIA FOR DETERMINING THE SUITABILITY OF A CANCER SCREENING TEST FOR USE IN THE WORKPLACE\n\n【111】 # Coles and Morrison  :\n1. The test should be \"effective\" in terms of its validity, reliability, sensitivity, specificity, and opera tional characteristics (such as predictive value).\nThe test should be \"accep\" to workers in terms of its cost, convenience, accessibility, lack of morbidity.\n\n【112】 # Halperin  :\nThe test should be \"effective\" in terms of its validity, relia bility, sensitivity, specificity, and operational characteristics (such as predictive value).\nThe test need not be uncompli cated or inexpensive, but its performance and interpretation must be done by competent profes sionals.\nThe test must be \"accep\" to workers in terms of its cost, convenience, accessibility, lack of morbidi t y .\nThe test results must be eval uated by comparison to a suipopulation, not necessarily the general population.\n\n【113】 # Action levels and related medical decisions must be deter mined in advance of screening (based on #1 above).\n\n【114】 # Adapted from \nEffective treatment is avail able if asymptomatic disease is detected.\n\n【115】 # Detecpreclinical phase must be highly prevalent among screened population.\n\n【116】 # Halperin \n1. The disease has important individual and public health consequences.\n2. Disease need not be trea, but must be preven\n\n【117】 # A detecpreclinical phase (DPCP) must exist and a target population (exhibiting a high\nprevalence of DPCP) be identified.\nFollow-up care (diagnostic, treatment, and social services) must be avaiI able.\nNatural history of the disease determines the feasibility and frequency of testing.\n\n【118】 # Adapted from \nA review of studies reporting histopathologic associations with radon progeny exposures lacked sufficient information to conclude definitely that only one specific lung cancer cell type was associated with these exposures .\nIn addition, a case-control study using data from the Third National Cancer Survey found that cigarette smoking was significantly associated with all three histologic types of lung cancer ; the relationship with small-cell carcinoma was strongest overall (odds ratio = 5., whereas those with squamous and adenocarcinoma were approximately equivalent (odds ratio = 3.. The issue of histopathologic associations with radon progeny exposures needs further research, especially considering that many underground miners smoked cigarettes.\n\n【119】 # Both cessation of smoking  and reduction of the radon progeny exposures\n-f underground miners will lower their risks for lung cancer.\n\n【120】 # C. Recommendat i ons 1. Smoking\nSince it appears that inhaled radon progeny either add to or multiply the underlying high lung cancer risk in smokers, a smoking cessation program is recommended. The combined effects of a lower (more protective) Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) and cessation of cigarette smoking  would probably provide a significant reduction in lifetime risks.\n\n【121】 # Lung Function Tests\nA baseline chest X-ray and annual spirometrie lung function tests, performed and interpreted according to the criteria of NIOSH or the American Thoracic Society, would be appropriate for medical decision-making concerning job placement, medical removal protection, and disability compensation should work-related respiratory problems  a later time.\n\n【122】 # . X -ra y Screening\nWhile chest X-ray screening is not an effective means of prevention of death due to occupational lung cancer, examination at 5-year intervals, and industry-wide analyses of the results of such tests may be an effective means of supplementing the primary prevention of other lung diseases, such as pneumoconioses.\n\n【123】 # . R a d ia tio n Exposure Records\nThe lifetime radiation exposure record of underground miners should include information about the dose and frequency of medical irradiation.\nIf radiation exposed workers are routinely screened for lung diseases by baseline and periodic follow-up chest X-rays, they will receive an average of about 0.025 rad per examination of external X-irradiation (where an \"examination\" consists of a postero-anterior and a lateral exposure) .\nIf examinations are conducted every 5 years, the average lung dose would be about 0.005 per year. Furthermore, because of the frequency of on-the-job accidents and injuries in underground mining , underground miners may receive considerably more medical X-irradiation over a working lifetime than workers exposed to other sources of ionizing radiation. For each of the following diagnostic examinations, the approximate X-ray dose to the lung is indicated in parentheses: thoracic spine (0.421 rad), ribs (0.324 rad), lumbar spine (0.133 rad), one shoulder (0.039 rad), lumbosacral spine (0.035 rad), and skull (0.002 rad) [\n\n【124】 # V. FEASIBILITY OF LOWERING THE STANDARD\nThis section examines the feasibility of lowering the current radon progeny exposure standard, including differences between current exposures and lower projected standards.\n\n【125】 # A. Comparison o f Current U.S. Underground Miner Radon Progeny Exposures with D iffe r e n t Standards\nThe uranium mining industry in the United States has recorded the annual exposures of underground miners, and the Atomic Industrial Forum (AIF) s are displayed in s A-9 to A-11. There has been some discrepancy between MSHA records and AIF records . Overall, the industry has been successful in controlling exposures to 4 WLM. Furthermore, the percentage of miners exposed to 3 WLM or higher decreased between 1973 and 1982 s A-9 to A-11, ).\nThere has been substantial mobility among the uranium miners, with many people working for short periods of time at different mines, so that the AIF separated the annual exposure data into two sets, \"all persons assigned to work underground\" and \"persons who worked underground 1,500 hours or more\" i.e., full time.\nIt appears that, for most underground uranium mine workers, the mining industry already can meet a radon progeny standard below the current level of 4 WLM annual exposure.\nIf the radon progeny exposure standard was set at 1 WLM, approximately one-third of all underground workers and less than two-thirds of the full-time underground workers would be exposed above a\n\n【126】 # In the case of nonuranium mines in the United States, it is clear they can meet a lower exposure standard, based on the limited data submitted by the mining companies to MSHA A-.\nOf those nonuranium mine workers whose exposures to radon progeny were recorded, the upper limits of exposure varied from 0.16 to 2.20 WL, depending upon the mining industry A-. Acknowledging the limitations on the way exposure data is collected A, section A.2.a.), the mining companies submitted information to MSHA which suggests that no more than 450 individuals are occasionally exposed to substantial radon progeny levels (i.e., 0.3 WL and above) A-. During 1983, these radon progeny exposed employees were found in only 4 nonuranium mines, out of a total of about 574 U.S. nonuranium metal and nonmetal underground mines. Therefore, it should be feasible to control the radon progeny exposures encountered by these 450 (or fewer) miners.\n\n【127】 # B. The Technological C apacity to F u rth er Reduce Exposure\nSome of the highest radon progeny exposures are received by people working in the smallest uranium mines, those employing less than ten people . Probably, these small mines can improve their ventilation systems and reduce worker exposures. Currently, many of these small mines are not operating due to the depressed prices for uranium.\n\n【128】 # There are a variety of techniques besides ventilation that can reduce workers' radiation exposures B).\nIn general, these techniques are more costly and less effective than ventilation. Nevertheless, these methods, in addition to ventilation, could be used to decrease the exposures of the relatively small number of uranium workers (46 during   It should be technically feasible for the mining industry to control the radon progeny exposures of these relatively few workers receiving substantial exposures. Also, an engineering analysis (based on data from only two mines) suggested that it is technically feasible for uranium mines to meet a standard as low as 1 WLM, using control techniques such as ventilation, bulkheads, and backfilling.\n\n【129】 # VI. CONCLUSION\n\n【130】 # Each of the five primary epidemiologic studies contained strengths and limitations.\nAll of the studies  rely on incomplete radon progeny exposure estimates to calculate the cumulative exposures of the underground miner cohorts. Nevertheless, they contain sufficient strength to demonstrate an excess lung cancer risk associated with radon progeny exposure. Also, an exposure-response relationship exists between cumulative radon progeny exposure and lung cancer mortality . Statistically significant SMR's above 400 were observed in three studies, where workers accumulated mean exposures above 100 WLM , Statistically significant SMR's between 140 and 390 were observed in two studies , where workers accumulated mean exposures below 100 WLM, and in preliminary findings from a third study by Tirmarche  where workers probably accumulated mean exposures below 100 WLM , NIOSH acknowledges the efforts of various groups  to compare attribuand relative risk estimates across different epidemiologic studies. NIOSH can neither validate nor refute these findings.\nAt this point, without access to the raw data and more specific information about epidemiologic methods, NIOSH is unwilling to speculate or make comparisons between the attribuor relative risk estimates in the five primary studies.\nThere were several classifications for identifying a substance as a carcinogen. \"Potential occupational carcinogen\" means any substance, or combination or mixture of substances, which causes an increased incidence of benign and/or malignant neoplasms, or a substantial decrease in the latency period between exposure and onset of neoplasms in humans or in one or more experimental mammalian species as the result of any oral, respiratory or dermal exposure, or any other exposure which results in the induction of tumors at a site other than the site of administration.\n\n【131】 # Such classifications have been developed by the National\n includes any substance which is metabolized into one or more potential occupational carcinogens by mammals.\nSince exposure to radon progeny has been shown to produce lung cancer in underground miners, it meets the OSHA criteria; thus, radon progeny should be considered an occupational carcinogen. Data on the current radon progeny exposures of uranium, metal, and nonmetal miners suggests that the mining industry, overall, is already capable of meeting a radon progeny standard below the current annual limit of 4 WLM. Recent limited research (based on data from only 2 mines) suggests that, using ventilation, bulkheads, and backfilling, it is technically feasible for mines to meet a standard as low as 1 WLM.\nAt the present time, there is no effective medical method to prevent or treat lung cancer to radon progeny exposure. Also, there is insufficient evidence to support an association between a specific lung cancer cell type and radon progeny exposure . Only exposure prevention measures are effective in lowering radon progeny induced lung cancer rates. These preventive measures include lowering the radon progeny exposures of underground uranium miners (and perhaps some underground metal and nonmetal miners), especially those that receive annual cumulative exposures near the present limit of 4 WLM. An additional measure is to encourage miners to stop smoking, because smoking and radon progeny exposure may act multiplicatively, or at least additively, to cause lung cancer.\nFinally, a lowering of exposure, especially for the workers currently exposed near 4 WLM, is recommended. Recent information suggests that it is technically feasible to control radon progeny exposures to levels as low as 1 WLM. NIOSH wishes to withhold a recommendation for a specific PEL, until completion of a quantitative risk assessment, which is now in progress.\nIn addition, the specific medical recommendations listed in Chapter IV should be implemented.\n\n【132】 # A. Current Work Force\n\n【133】 # Uranium Miners a. M iners in th e U nited S tates\nThe number of underground mine workers (including miners and service and support staff) dropped from approximately 5,037 in 1980 to 2,150 in 1982 A-. The number of underground miners, the group receiving the highest exposures, dropped from 2,760 to 1,275. This decrease was due to a recent fall in the price of uranium and reduced uranium demand.\nIn the mines in the United States there are numerous temporary, short-term workers; in 1978, out of all employees who worked underground, only 46 percent worked 1,500 or more hours underground (i.e., full-time).\n\n【134】 # b.

In cases where corporations had widely separated operations under different managers, each was considered a separate operation. cProduction includes production and development miners.\n\n【141】 # Exposure of U.S. underground uranium miners to radon daughters in 1979 as\n perform maintenance, service and supervisory duties, such employees were classified as production workers. \"Maintenance includes mechanics and electricians.\nService includes motormen, haulage crews, drift repairmen, station tenders, skip tenders, etc. 'Salaried includes engineers, supervisors, geologists and ventilation personnel. uranium mines in the United States, this is somewhat misleading. These workers can receive high exposures, and because they only work for short periods of time, their annual average exposure is low. The average exposure for those miners working full time, that is over 1,500 hours underground, was higher; 1.45 WLM in 1978.\nUnderground mining exposure records were placed into four general job categories by the AIF, i.e., production, maintenance, service, and salaried. As a group, the production workers who worked more than 1,500 hours underground should have higher exposures than the remaining uranium mining work force.\nIn 1978, the average exposure of these workers was 1.74 WLM  A- and in 1979 their average exposure was approximately 1.88 WLM .\nIn contrast, in 1979 and 1980, MSHA inspectors recorded average radon progeny WL concentrations for underground uranium mining production workers of 0.30 WL or higher, which means that some of these workers could receive 4 WLM or more per year. Cooper estimated that the average annual exposure of full-time underground production workers was about 2. 9 WLM during 1979 . The number of workers that receive these high exposure levels may be small; AIF reported that among full-time underground uranium miners in 1979, only 3 out of 1,711 production workers and 3 out of 488 maintenance workers received more than 4 WLM annually  s A-10 and A-.\nOverall, most uranium mine workers' (including those workers who spend only part of their time underground) exposure is well below the standard of 4 WLM and on the average may be about 1 WLM ,  A -. A relatively small number of workers, primarily full-time underground production and maintenance workers, have exposures above the 4 WLM standard  s A-9 through A-. The most recent available data, for 1982, showed that only 2 underground employees (0.1 percent) received radon progeny exposures of 4.0-5.0 WLM and 44 employees (1.6 percent) received exposures of 3.0-4.0 WLM. .\nIt should be possible to lower radon progeny exposure levels for this relatively small number of miners.\n\n【142】 # b. Miners Outside the United States\nThe exposure of underground uranium miners depends on the quality of the uranium ore body and the ventilation rate.\nIn other countries, (excepting Canada) the uranium ore is frequently of a lower grade than the ore in the United States, so with good ventilation techniques, the foreign uranium miners should receive lower exposures than the miners in the United States. Recent s for radiation exposure in underground uranium mines in Canada, France, India, Argentina, and China have been published in the literature  A-3\nThe underground uranium miners of Canada had an average annual exposure to radon progeny of 0.74 WLM in 1978.\nIn 1980, the median exposure for miners in three underground mines in Saskatchewan was below 0.6 WLM and only about three workers in one mine were exposed to 3-4 WLM.\nIn addition, some of these miners had substantial gamma exposure.\nIn the Cluff mine, gamma exposures were as high as 3.5 rem and above, and in the Eldorado and Cluff mines many workers (approximately  were exposed to 1-3 rem .\nThe French uranium miners had average annual radon progeny exposures of 2.0 WLM and 1.4 WLM in 1978 and1979, respectively .\nIn 1975, the median radon progeny exposure was below 0.10 WL, yet as many as 5.35 percent of the workers were exposed to 0.30 to 0.80 WL, potentially receiving more than 4 WLM annually  A-  .\n a record of gamma exposure in French underground uranium mines. The mean annual dose was 0.49 rem, but some miners received much higher doses; 9.16 percent received 1.0-1.5 rem, 5.3 percent received 1.5-2.5 rem and 0.65 percent received 2.5-3.0 rem .\nIn the underground uranium mines in France, gamma exposure may constitute a major part of the total radiation.\nThere is limited information available concerning typical radon progeny exposures in underground uranium mines in India, Argentina,and China . For the mines in India, s for potential exposure are given by job category.\nIn 1979, the drilling crew received an estimate of 2.6 WLM of potential alpha energy exposure, the mucking crew about 2.1 WLM, and \"others\" about 1.7 WLM  A - ,\nIn Argentina, the average annual radon progeny exposure was about 2.4 WLM during 1980.\n\n【143】 # Nonuranium Miners a. Hard Rock Miners in the United States\nSome of the highest radon progeny exposures are found in the iron, zinc, fluorspar, and bauxite mines A-.\nIn 1975, iron miners were exposed to 0.14-0.90 WL, zinc miners to 0.07-1.40 WL, fluorspar miners to 0.30-2.20 WL and bauxite miners to 0.07-1. 40 WL .\nIf these readings are typical, some hard rock miners in the United States, especially those in fluorspar mines, could have radon progeny exposures much higher than 4 WLM. However, recent data submitted by U.S. metal and non metal mining companies to MSHA suggests that no more than 450 individuals are occasionally exposed to 0.3 WL A -. During 1983, only 4 companies, 2 molybdenum, 1 phosphate and 1 tungsten, submitted individual exposure records for their employees to MSHA.\n 199 .\n\n【144】 # b. Hard Rock Miners Outside the United States\nRadon progeny exposure levels have been measured in nonuranium mines in Finland, Italy, Norway, South Africa, Sweden, the United Kingdom and Poland s A-14 to A- . The most recent s for all of these countries show annual average radon progeny exposures of 2.6 WLM or less. However, in many of these countries the average potential alpha energy concentrations exceed 0.3 WL, suggesting that individual miners may be exposed to more than 4 WLM per year (if they work full time during the year). Nonuranium miners (especially iron, zinc, lead, copper, or gold miners) in Italy, Poland, South Africa, and Great Britain may be exposed to more than 4 WLM annually .\nIn the United Kingdom, 4 percent of the noncoal miners were exposed to 4 WLM or more, however, many of the miners did not work full 8-hour shifts.\nIf the underground noncoal miners in the United Kingdom worked full 8-hour shifts, as many as 20 percent of the workers could be exposed above 4 WLM/yr . Recent reports for five Chinese tin mines showed radon progeny levels of 0.67 to 1.73 WL during 1978 .  22  It may be most effective to combine some of these techniques, e.g., to use positive pressure ventilation in combination with procedures to decrease the volume of the mine air needing ventilation, such as bulkheads or backfilling. Bulkheads could be made more secure against radon gas leaks by maintaining a slight negative pressure behind the bulkhead and painting sealant on nearby exposed rock. Finally, most of the techniques described in B-1 and in this chapter will decrease inhalation exposure to alpha radiation from the decay products of radon and thoron gases, but won't affect gamma radiation levels.\n\n【145】 # Mechanical Ventilation\nMechanical ventilation is the primary and most successful technique currently in use for reducing exposure to radon decay products. In uranium mines in the United States, during the early 1950's before mechanical ventilation became prevalent, average measurements of 2-200 WL of radon decay products were common .\nIn contrast, during 1979 and 1980, the highest average working level for radon progeny recorded by MSHA was 0.46 WL B-. Thus, there has been a great decrease in exposure to radon decay products in uranium mines primarily due to improvement in ventilation.\n successfully reduced radon progeny levels in nonuranium mines with mechanical ventilation.\nThe average annual exposure for the nonuranium miners of Sweden was 4.7 WLM in 1970, due to ventilation improvements, and decreased to 0.7 WLM in 1980 .\nIn the case of uranium miners in the United States, it is not clear whether there could be significant further decreases in exposures to radon decay products with ventilation improvements alone. These few mines may need to use other techniques, besides dilution ventilation, to reduce miners' exposure to radon progeny B-.\n\n【146】 # Other Dust Control Methods\nSpraying water and delaying blasting until the end of shifts are two other dust control methods currently in use in most underground uranium mines. Most mines use these methods to control silica dust, but in uranium mines these methods can help control uranium ore dust.\nDrilling and blasting are two mining activities that generate high levels of uranium ore dust. Exposure to uranium ore dust alone may be carcinogenic, and high dust or smoke levels may modify the respiratory tract distribution of a miner's exposure to radon progeny (by increasing the proportion of radon progeny attached to respirable and nonrespirable size dust particles).\nIn wet drilling, water sprays from the drill onto  If a person approaches or exceeds the lifetime limit on exposure, they are trans ferred to another job at a lower exposure level with retention of pay, if available, or are removed from work at full pay if another job is not available. Advantages: Protects individual miners against high cumulative exposures. Disadvantages: Spreads exposure over a larger number of people. This system works best when used with a reliable bioassay for exposure, which is not available in the case of radon gas or progeny. Medical removal may not be effective if intense, short-term exposure to inhaled alpha radiation is more hazardous than cumulative radiation exposure.\n(Cont i nued) The drills are equipped with automatic water valves that turn the water and compressed air on simultaneously. (These techniques have been used in mines since the 1930's.) Advantages: The water cuts down on radioactive uranium ore dust. Disadvantages: Difficult to set up in areas where water is scarce. The miners us i ng the drill get w e t .\nDynamite blasting at the end of shift, instead of throughout the day, reduces exposure to dust and smoke. Also, radon gas levels tend to be high immediately after blasting .\nAdvantages: Most miners have less exposure to dust and smoke particles and thus less radiation exposure. Disadvantages: Extra production schedule planning is necessary.\nThis involves the use of fan maintenance, backup electrical systems, and spare fans to minimize fan shutdowns during working hours.\nPositive pressure at the rock surface is a barrier to radon flow. One drawback is that high positive pressure in one area may force the radon into nearby low pressure areas .\n increases the emission of radon from the surrounding rock by creating a negative pressure.\nPositive pressure ventilation is shut down during times when the mine is inactive, creating a temporary negative pressure. This results in energy savings during the shut down periods.\nThe best ventilation method to use depends on the mine topography and production schedule. Ventilation methods may be most effective when used in combination with techniques that cut down on the area needing ventilation, such as bulkheads and backfilling .\nThe filter respirator covers the miner's mouth and nose and filters the mine air through fiber filters .\nAdvantages: As a temporary short-term protective measure, the half-mask respirator affords approximately greater than 90 percent efficiency in reduction of miner's exposure to radon daughters attached to dusts, fumes, and mists. Disadvantages: The respirators may hinder vision, be warm to use under some working conditions, add significant resistance to the miner's breathing and require careful maintenance to assure their continued effectiveness. Filter respirators must be carefully fitted to each wearer, using quantitative respirator fit tests. Only MSHA/NIOSH-certified respirators shall be u s e d .\n wet down muck piles and the walls of some tunnels to control dust. Since the 1930's these two techniques have been used in some mines. Blasting increases uranium ore dust and radon gas levels remain high for about an hour afterwards . Delaying blasting until the end of the work-shift removes the miner from an area with high dust and radon gas levels, and allows the ventilation system to reduce these levels before the miner returns to work.\n\n【147】 # Additional Control Methods\nAir cleaning equipment, filter respirators, and separate air supplies are seldom used in the underground mining environment. An air cleaning apparatus can remove dust, but it is expensive compared to traditional ventilation methods and is most useful in circumscribed areas .\nFilter respirators and supplied-air respirators are difficult to use in the mining environment and their use should be limited to emergency conditions, such as temporary excursions of the radon progeny concentrations above 1 WL. Respirators tend to restrict movement and vision, may be too warm to wear, have significant breathing resistance, and require careful maintenance and fitting to assure their continued effectiveness. Only MSHA/NIOSH-certified respirators shall be used. Another radon progeny control method is robotics or increased automation. Techniques, such as robotics, that minimize the time the miner spends in the high exposure areas of the mine and in activities such as drilling, blasting, or loading ore, will decrease the miner's radiation exposure. Although, at present, robotics has a limited place in the mines, it may be possible in the future to further automate the uranium ore mining process.\n\n【148】 # B. A dm inistrative Controls\n\n【149】 # Medical Removal Protection\nOne type of administrative control is a medical removal protection (MRP) program. Under this program, when an individual's exposure approaches or exceeds a certain limit, the person is reassigned to an area with a lower exposure level. The MRP program has been very effective in reducing exposure in the (noncarcinogenic) lead industries . In this case, blood lead levels could be used as a method to biologically monitor a worker's lead exposure. However, MRP has certain drawbacks when used as an administrative control for exposure to a known human carcinogen such as radon progeny in underground uranium mines.\nFirst, according to our current knowledge of radiation carcinogenesis, it is prudent public health policy to presume that there is no threshold for radon-progeny-induced cancer, and thus no exposure can be assumed to be safe. Therefore, the high exposure individuals who are removed from the job are protected against further radon progeny risk, but the radon progeny exposure (and risk) is spread out over a larger population of workers. Second, at this time, there is no good biological monitoring method for radon progeny exposure because the primary health effect is a carcinogenic, rather than a toxicologic, response. Routine, periodic 132 sputum cytological examinations and chest X-rays are not effective screening tests for the detection of early reversible signs of lung cancer, and cancer itself may only appear after years of exposure. Finally, respirators (as they are presently designed) are very difficult to use in the underground mining environment.\n\n【150】 # Alarm Systems\nAnother type of administrative control involves the use of alarm systems. This method has been fairly effective in coal mines where continuous monitors for methane gas have been tied to alarm systems. Reliable continuous monitors for radon progeny are now technically feasible  ) and could be connected to alarm systems, as well as the control center for the ventilation system. The person who controls the ventilation could increase air movement in mine areas with high radon progeny levels. Also, the continuous monitors might be useful for enforcement purposes, because the MSHA inspector would have a record of excessive radon progeny measurements levels since the last inspection. For recordkeeping and enforcement purposes, the use of data from continuous alarm-monitors would depend heavily on the reliability and validity of these devices, as well as their durability and security from tampering in the mine environment.\n\n【151】 # Contract Mining\n encourages miners to work overtime, thus increasing their cumulative internal and external radiation exposures. In addition, some miners, especially before the reduced demand for uranium, went from mine to mine working uranium ore one month and gold the next, getting radon progeny exposures in both locations. This mobility of the work force makes it harder to monitor and track the miners' total radiation exposure, making it more likely that a miner could receive cumulative exposures in excess of current and future standards. One type of administrative control is to modify the contract mining system so that workers would have more incentive to protect their own health on the job. This issue needs further study and discussion, including input from the mining industries, unions, and contract miners.\n\n【152】 # GLOSSARY\nAbsorbed Do s e : The amount of energy absorbed by ionizing radiation per unit mass. Absorbed doses are expressed in units of rads or grays, or in prefixed forms of these units such as millirad (mrad, 10~3 rad), microrad (urad, 10- rad), etc.- The gray (Gy) is equal to 1 joule per kilogram (1 J/kg). The £ad is equal to 6.24 x 10 MeV per gram, or 100 ergs per gram. One gray = 100 rad.\nAdditive Relative Risk Mod e l : The relative risk from the combined exposure to radon progeny and smoking equals the sum of the risks from each exposure considered separately. One example of an additive linear relative risk mode I is: Person-Years at Risk (PYR): In a lifeanalysis, the number of PY at risk of dying from disease, usually calculated from the time the miner enters the cohort until death or the end of follow-up.

INTRODUCTION\nA report evaluating epidemiologic studies of lung cancer in underground miners was recently sent to the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH).\nThat report concluded that prolonged exposure to radon progeny at the current standard of 4 WLM/year produced an elevated risk of death from lung cancer. It is the objective of this report to make quantitative risk estimates for various levels of cumulative exposure. In addition, other factors influencing the exposure-risk relationship will be identified and quantified whenever possible.\nThis report is based upon data collected from a cohort consisting of 3366 white underground uranium miners working in the Colorado Plateau (located within the states of Colorado, Utah, New Mexico and Arizona).\nThe actual risk estimates were computed from data on 3346 members of the cohort.\nTen original members were determined to have had no record of underground mining, four were non-white, and six had inadequate cigarette smoking i nformat ion.\nEntry into the cohort was defined by race, sex, working at least one month in underground uranium mines, volunteering for at least one medical survey between 1950 and 1960, and providing social and occupational data of sufficient detail .\n Lung Cancer mortality was defined as anyone assigned an International Classification of Disease (ICD) code of 162 or 163 (same designation in Sixth through Ninth Revisions).\nPrevious analyses of this cohort reported by Waxwei ler et a l .  and Whittemore and McMillan  considered follow-up only through 1977.  presents a comparison of vital status of the cohort at the end of 1977 and 1982.\n\n【156】 # II. PROTOCOL FOR STATISTICAL ANALYSIS\nMuch of the epidemiologic work in the past regarding the analysis of mortality in occupational cohorts has involved modified life analysis. This form of analysis has a strong appeal due to its familiarity and ease of interpretation.\n\n【157】 This expected mortality is then compared to the observed mortality via a ratio defined as:\n\n【158】 # A. Type of Analysis Used\n2 o SMR; = i i j 2 E ij i\n\n【159】 However, after stratification by age, race, sex, calendar year, other confounders, and finally the exposure of interest, there are seldom enough observed deaths to make rates in these strata reliable.\n\n【160】 An alternative to use of the modified life approach is some form of statistical modeling. Modeling to estimate health risks is necessary when conclusions must be drawn about risk in regions of the exposure-response relationship for which data are too sparse to estimate risk directly.\n permits risk estimates to be simultaneously adjusted for confounders, such as age or co-carcinogenic exposures, as well as interactions between exposure and other risk factors.\nThis flexibility is particularly important in making risk estimates at relatively low cumulative exposures when using the Colorado Plateau data.\nMost miners in this cohort were exposed to high levels of radon progeny (mean exposure = 834 WLM).\nSince primary interest in risk estimates is below 120 WLM based on current exposures, some type of statistical model is essential.\nThere have been a number of types of models suggested for examination of cause-specific mortality as a function of various risk factors.\nThe two most popular types of models are the absolute risk model and the relative risk model. The absolute risk model can be written as: R(t ;z) = Rg(t) + R ( z , /?) where R9t;z) is the incidence at age t for someone with risk factors z, Rg(t) is the baseline or background incidence at age t and R(z, ) is the incremental incidence as a function of the risk factors z, and coefficients which are estimated from the data.\nThis form of risk model was not used in the risk assessment since it had been rejected due to poor fit to the U.S. uranium miner data by Lundin .\nIn contrast, the relative risk model generally takes the form: R(t;z) = R0 (t) R(z,. This model assumes that excess risk is proportional to background incidence rates.\nRelative risk models have become increasingly popular in recent years and were found to provide good fits to the data from earlier follow-ups of the U.S. uranium miners cohort by Lundin  and Whittemore and McMillan . This type of model has been selected as the basic analytical method for this report.\n\n【161】 # B. The Proportional Hazards Modei\nA relative risk model which is particularly well-suited to longitudinal mortality studies is one proposed by Cox .\nThis model is commonly referred to as the Cox proportional hazards model.\nA major advantage of this approach over the more common life method is that it permits the use of internal comparison groups while controlling simultaneously for such confounders as cigarette smoking, age, and year of birth.\nIn addition, time-dependent covariates such as cumulative exposure may be incorporated into the model. This is essential in any longitudinal study where follow-up and the exposure period overlap.\nRelative risk estimates are based on rate ratios similar to those produced in the modified life analysis.\nThat is, the Cox model operates in a dynamic framework by considering incidence rates over the entire period of follow-up.\nThe Cox model can be expressed mathematically as:\nX(t;z) = X 0 (t)exp(£z(t))\nwhere X(t;z) for this study is the age-specific lung cancer mortality rate for a miner with exposure and other risk factors represented by a covariate vector z.\nThe underlying age-specific lung cancer mortality rate for the unexposed is represented byAo(t).\nThe function exp(J3z) is generally used to model risk of death from the cause of interest which depends upon the risk factors z and the coefficients ^ which are estimated from the data.\n\n【162】 # C. Alternative Forms of the Risk Function\nAlthough the exponential or log-linear function exp(0z) is the usual choice of a model for risk, any positive function may be used as long as the risk function is equal to 1.0 when the coefficients are all equal to zero. The most common alternative risk functions are the linear (1 + 0z) and the power function (exp( /?1nz) = z^ ).\nAll three forms of risk functions were considered in modeling the U.S. uranium miners data.\n\n【163】 # D. Results of Model Development\n\n【164】 # Ident i f ic a t ion of Confounders and/or E ffe c t Mod i f iers\n included in the model.\nAnother risk factor strongly associated with lung cancer mortality is age.\nThis was tightly controlled by using age as the time dimension t in the model A(t;z).\nThat is, the age at death of each lung cancer victim was recorded and all other miners alive and at risk were compared to him at that age.\nIn this way, the cumulative exposure to radon daughters and pack-years of cigarettes were incorporated as time-dependent covariates by calculating their values at each age of death from lung cancer. This assures that proper age-adjusted comparisons were made throughout the period of follow-up.\nA number of other variables were examined in developing the appropriate risk model.\nA list of all potential risk factors considered for inclusion in the model are provided in \n as potential effect modifiers by assessing their interaction with cumulative radon daughter exposure.\nAn attempt was made to compare the fit of each of the three models during the model development stage of the analysis.\nHowever, it soon became apparent that the linear model did not fit well over the full range of radon daughter exposures and cumulative smoking levels. In fact, the iterative solution to the likelihood equations would not converge when using the linear model when both cumulative exposure and pack-years of smoking were both entered simultaneously (either as linear or linear-quadratic forms).\nThe linear model could only be made to converge when the model was restricted to cumulative exposure below 600 WLM with no other covariates included.\nThe restricted linear model resulted in a non-significant result in this exposure range and was subsequently eliminated from consideration.\nOf the remaining two types of relative risk models (log-linear and power function), the covariates found to be most highly associated with lung cancer incidence rates were cumulative exposure (WLM), cumulative smoking (packs), and age at initial exposure (months).  illustrates the form and degree of fit as measured by the likelihood  1BGR -background radon exposure = 0.2 WLM/year BGS = background cigarette smoking = 0.005 packs/day ratio for these two models.\nThe log-linear model required the addition of quadratic terms in cumulative exposure and cigarette smoking to provide an adequate fit.\nThis was not necessary when developing the power function model.\nAs shown in , the power function model provided the best fit to the data and will be used hereafter in the risk assessment.\nSince the power function model involves the natural logarithms of cumulative exposure and cumulative cigarette smoking, zero values of these variables were not permitted.\nIn order to avoid this an estimate of cumulative background exposure was added to each miner's cumulative radon daughter and cigarette totals.\n the amount used by Whittemore and McMillan  in an earlier analysis.\nIn a similar fashion 0.005 packs per day were added for each day since birth to the cumulative smoking totals based upon estimates of Hinds and First .\nOf particular interest is the joint effect of exposure to radon daughters and cigarette smoking.\nTherefore, the interaction of radon daughter exposure and cigarette smoking was included in the multiplicative power function model.\nThe results showed a negative, borderline significant result ( |3=0.087,p=0.. When a similar analysis was run with mortality data complete only through 1977, there was no indication of a significant negative effect. Therefore, based on more complete follow-up through 1982, the joint effect of radon daughter exposure and cigarette smoking appears to be slightly less than multiplicative but greater than additive. This is similar to the finding of Thomas and McNeill  in their grouped data analysis of the five major radon daughter cohorts.\nIt is still consistent with a synergistic effect of radon exposure and cigarette smoking which is usually defined as a joint effect exceeding the sum of the individual effects.\n\n【165】 # Weighting Exposure Over Time\nAn important consideration in fitting any of these models was the proper time-weighting of exposure.\nSince most forms of cancer, including lung cancer, have relatively long latency periods between exposure and manifestation of the disease, some weighting of exposure over time is appropriate.\nThe most common weighting scheme is commonly referred to as lagging.\nThis involves elimination of any exposure accumulated in a specified period of years before death from lung cancer.\nThis provides a way of considering only that exposure that had a reasonable chance of causing death from lung cancer.\nObviously exposures received in the few years immediately prior to lung cancer deaths are ineffective in the exposure-response relationship.\nIn order to investigate the appropriate number of years to lag exposure in this cohort, a series of lags ranging from 0 to 12 years was used.  illustrates the results of these trials.\nIt is evident from the improved fit, as measured by the log-likelihood of the model, that a lag of 6 years for cumulative exposure is the best choice for this analysis.\n by Muller for the Canadian data. Their choices were somewhat arbitrary and largely based on knowledge that most cancers involve relatively long latency periods. The implications of a shorter lag will be discussed in a later section of this report.\nAn issue related to lagging of cumulative exposure and cumulative cigarette smoking is the lack of information on these variables in recent years.\nRadon daughter exposure was last updated in 1969. However, the absence of current exposure information should have minimal impact upon this analysis since over 90% of the miners in the cohort had retired from uranium mining for more than one year by 1969.\nThose few who continued mining were exposed at levels considerably less than those experienced in earlier years.\n unknown after 1969, all miners still smoking at that time were assumed to continue at their last recorded smoking rate.\nNIOSH is currently conducting a survey of radon daughter exposure and cigarette smoking status subsequent to 1969, but this information will not be available for at least another year.\nThe aim of lagging exposure is the elimination of exposure which is not etiologically responsible for lung cancer mortality. An implicit assumption in the use of this technique is that exposure changes from completely effective to completely ineffective at one instant in time. The actual form of this weighting function is illustrated in  Because of the biological implausibi Iity of such a situation, Land  proposed that the effectiveness of cumulative exposure be linearly phased in over a period of several years.\nAn illustration of such a weighting function is provided in \nConsequently, we tried various combinations of lagging and linear partial weighting with the combination illustrated in  providing the best fit, i.e. a lag of 4 years followed by linear partial weighting in the period 4-10 years prior to death from lung cancer.\nThis scheme provided a fit essentially the same as that of a simple lag of six years but was chosen over lagging because of its biological plausibility.\n\n【166】 # INFLUENCE OF TEMPORAL FACTORS\nPerhaps the most difficult aspect of producing a valid quantitative risk assessment is dealing with the effects of various time-related factors upon the exposure-risk relationship.\nOne very important temporal influence concerns the two components of cumulative exposure itself.\nIn most longitudinal studies the quantitative exposure index is some form of cumulative exposure.\nHowever, cumulative exposure is actually the product of duration of exposure and intensity or rate of exposure.\nWhen one uses cumulative exposure in assessing risk, the implicit assumption is that high exposure rates for short periods of time are equivalent etiologically to low exposures for long periods of time, all else being equal.\nA number of investigators have examined the effect of exposure rate in the U.S. uranium miner data. Whittemore and McMillan ) found no statistically significant effect of exposure rate.\nLundin et al . in the 1971 monograph concluded that there was no significant evidence of an exposure rate effect in the 120-360 WLM cumulative exposure range. These investigators apparently defined exposure rate as the ratio of total cumulative exposure and duration of employment (defined as the period of time between first and last employment in underground uranium mining work histories).\nFor most forms of employment, this is the accepted definition of average exposure rate.\nHowever, underground uranium mining is a very sporadic form of employment.\nThe actual time spent underground was often a relatively small fraction of the total employment history. Therefore, exposure rate as defined by cumulative exposure divided by the number of months actually spent underground is often a very different measure than that obtained by using duration of employment in the denominator.\nConsequently, the effect of exposure rate was re-examined using the actual average exposure rate experienced while underground, eliminating any gaps in employment.\nAlthough earlier analyses using total duration of employment produced negative but non-significant results, the refined definition showed a statistically significant negative exposure rate effect (p =-0.043, p<0. as shown in \nThis implies that among groups of miners receiving equivalent cumulative exposures, those exposed to lower levels for longer periods of time are at greater risk of lung cancer.\nBecause the coefficient is relatively small, however, an appreciable effect upon risk of lung cancer would not be expected unless rates were different by an order of magnitude, i.e., a miner with exposure received at a rate ten times lower than a miner of the same age, smoking habits, and cumulative exposure would have (0.~-043= i i o 4 or 10.4% greater risk of lung cancer.\nBecause a negative exposure rate effect is very important and potentially controversial, it was examined in more depth.\nOf particular interest was the possibility that this effect was different at low versus high cumulative exposure levels.\nConsequently, the homogeneity of this effect across the full exposure range was examined by forming two sub-cohorts: one below the mean exposure (834 WLM) and one above the mean.\nThe interaction of the exposure rate effect with these two strata was then tested. Results showed a significant interaction ( P=0.157, P=0.. The direction of the A. Exposure-Rate Effect Background for cumulative radon daughter exposure: BGR=0.4 WLM/year Background for cumulative cigarette smoking: BGS=0.005 packs/day interaction indicated that the exposure rate effect was stronger in the lower cumulative exposure range (0-834 WLM). Specifically, a miner who received total exposure below 834 WLM at rate one tenth as great as another miner of the same age, smoking status and cumulative exposure would have a 58 percent greater risk of lung cancer.\nHowever, the increased risk would only be 10 percent at the lower exposure rate for miners in the 834-10,000 WLM range.\nAlthough a statistically significant negative exposure-rate effect had not been found previously in this U.S. cohort, there is considerable evidence of such findings in animal studies of high LET radiation. Raabe et al .  reported a strong low dose-rate effect in beagles exposed to internally deposited isotopes of radium and strontium.\nRisk of bone cancer was as much as ten times as great per unit dose for low rates as compared to the highest rates used. Cross et a l .  found a negative dose-rate effect for risk of lung tumors in rats exposed to airborne radon daughters. Chameaud  found similar results in a French study of Sprague-Dawley rats exposed to inhalation of radon decay products.\nHill et a l .  found reduced dose rates of fission-spectrum neutrons produced significantly higher neoplastic transformation rates per rad in cell cultures of C3H mouse embryos. Although all of these studies show low dose-rate effects, no study as yet, animal or human, has investigated such effects at the very low dose rates currently found in well-ventilated uranium mines.\n\n【167】 # B. Calendar Time\nIt is well-known that mortality patterns change over time.\nSuch exogenous risk factors as the prevalence of smoking and alcohol consumption, medical care, and various life style characteristics are all influenced by a changing society.\nTherefore, the effect of calendar time upon risk estimates, often called the cohort effect, must be controlled.\nThe analysis of the U.S. uranium miners cohort was stratified by decade of birth so that miners dying of lung cancer were compared only to those members of the cohort at the same age and who were born within 10 years of the case.\nThe usual assumption in a stratified analysis is that baseline mortality rates may be different from stratum to stratum but the relat i ve risk is the same across all strata for miners with comparable risk factors.\nIn order to check this assumption, the interaction of cumulative radon daughter exposure and birth decade was examined.\nResults indicated a statistically significant positive interaction ( P=0.173,P=0.. This implies that miners born in later decades are at a greater risk of lung cancer per unit of exposure when compared to miners of the same age born earlier.\nSince miners born in later decades were exposed at lower exposure rates, this result could be associated with the negative exposure rate effect described ear Iier.\n\n【168】 # C. M ultistage Theory of Carcinogenesis\nOne of the most popular theories for explaining the temporal patterns in mortality studies of carcinogenesis is the multistage model. Originally proposed by Muller  and Nordling  and later refined by Armitage and Doll , the multistage theory predicts an increase in cancer incidence as a function of time since exposure to some carcinogen. In general, the theory proposes that a malignant tumor arises from a single cell which has undergone a series of herichanges. The changes may be thought of as distinct stages in the carcinogenic process, each with a low probability of occurrence and a slow progression time in the absence of carcinogenic exposures.\nA carcinogen may act on any or all of the stages in this process.\nCarcinogens affecting the first stage are commonly referred to as initiators, while those affecting later stages are called promoters or progressors.\nInitiators are characterized by long latency periods between initial exposure and death, often exceeding 20 years.\nPromoters, on the other hand, usually have shorter latent periods since fewer stages must be transgressed before a malignant cell is produced.\nIt is impossible to prove whether or not the mathematical form of the multistage model actually holds in a given situation.\nHowever, a number of its predictions have been verified experimentally by Peto .\nTherefore, if one subscribes to some form of the multistage model, it is possible to predict whether exposure acts at an early or late stage in the carcinogenic process by examining the temporal patterns in the data. Whittemore , Day and Brown , and Brown and Chu  have all reported the effect on excess relative risk of age at initial exposure and time since cessation of exposure.\nBy examining these factors, we may better understand the underlying cancer mechanism operative in this cohort.\n\n【169】 # D. Age a t I n i t i a l Exposure\nWhittemore  considered the multistage model using three exposure scenarios:\nsingle exposure at one point in time, continuous exposure at a constant rate, and exposure of varying intensity.\nWhen considering the latter category (the usual occupational situation) she found that excess relative risk was a decreasing function of age at initial exposure if an early stage was affected.\nWhen a late stage is affected by exposure, however, excess relative risk is an increasing function of age at initial exposure. Day and Brown  predicted the functional relationship between excess relative risk and age at initial exposure for the first four stages of a five-stage process when duration was held constant.  illustrates their findings which are in qualitative agreement with those of Whittemore. Results of the analysis in our data, as illustrated in , indicate a positive and statistically significant coefficient for age at initial exposure (P=0.0023, P=0.. This implies that miners initially exposed at later ages are at greater risk of lung cancer than those exposed at younger ages, all else being equal.\nSpecifically, a miner with the same radon daughter exposure and smoking history who was initially exposed ten years (120 months) later in age than another miner, would have exp(0.0023x=1.32 or 32% higher risk of lung cancer.\nThis result is consistent with the effect of radon daughters occurring at a late stage in the carcinogenic process.\nA similar age effect was reported by Mancuso  in an analysis of cancer risk in the Hanford workers exposed to who I e-body radiation.\nAn analysis of age at start of smoking amona miners resulted in a negative but non-significant coefficient (3=0. 0016,p=0..\n be consistent with the hypothesis of Doll and Peto  that smoking acts at both early and late stages, which would tend to obscure predictive ability of age at start of smoking.\nA plot of the effect of age at initial exposure for both radon daughters and cigarette smoking is given in  Day and Brown  predicted the effect upon relative risk of time since cessation of exposure when a multistage model is assumed.\n\n【170】 # E. Time Since Cessation of Exposure\nThey found that when exposure begins some time after infancy, excess relative risk increases, peaks, and then decreases with time since termination of exposure when the first stage is affected. When the penultimate (next to last) stage is affected, relative risk strictly decreases with time after last exposure.\n illustrates their predictions for the effect of time since cessation of exposure on the first four stages in a five stage model with duration of exposure fixed at five years.\nIn order to investigate the effect of cessation of exposure on this cohort, all miners were identified who had indicated retirement from uranium mining during the course of follow-up. Approximately 95% of the cohort had retired for more than one year prior to 1970.\nThe average time since last exposure was 18.0 years for those miners not dying of lung cancer and 9.9 years for lung cancer cases.\nThe time in months since last exposure was entered as a time-dependent covariable in the original model containing log of exposure, log of smoking, and age at initial exposure.\nThe estimated coefficient of this term was negative and highly significant ( P=-0.0056,p<0..\nThus a miner's chances of surviving lung cancer increase dramatically with each year outside the mines.\nSpecifically, the model predicts that the risk of lung cancer 10 years after mining uranium is exp(-0.0056x=0.511 relative to someone still mining with the same cumulative exposure, smoking history, and age.\nWhen a similar analysis of time since cessation of cigarette smoking was run, the results were inconclusive.\nThe coefficient was very small and non-significant (P=0.003,p=0.. However, since a relatively small number of miners were ex-smokers (7.7%) there is little power for detection of such an effect even if it actually exists.\n illustrates the effect of time since last exposure for both radon daughters and cigarette smoking.\nThe implication of these results are essentially the same as that obtained by examination of age at initial exposure.\nThe strong negative effect of time since last exposure implies that radon daughters act at a late stage in the carcinogenic process.\nThe effect of stopping cigarette smoking, while based on a small amount of data, still indicates either an intermediate stage effect or a combination of early and late stage effects.\n\n【171】 # E F F E C T OF T IM E S IN C E L A S T E X PO SU R E ON E X C E S S R E L A T IV E R IS K T IM E S IN C E L A S T E X P O S U R E (Y E A R S !)

ERRORS IN EXPOSURE DATA AND THEIR EFFECT UPON RISK ASSESSMENT\nIn animal carcinogenesis studies, exposures or doses are usually known with a high degree of accuracy and precision. However, the same cannot be said regarding epidemiologic quantitative risk studies.\nIn most epidemiologic studies, the actual dose to target organs can only be estimated by dosimetric modeling. This is seldom attempted in quantitative risk assessments.\nThe dosimetry of radon daughter exposure is very complex, involving such factors as respiration rates, particle size distribution, deposition in the lung, and radon/radon daughter equilibrium.\nMost risk assessments are modeled as functions of some exposure index, which is the method used in this report.\nIt is the purpose of this section to estimate the magnitude of exposure errors and their effect upon quantitative risk models.\nAccording to Lundin et a l . , exposures in a given mine and year were estimated in one of four ways:\n1. actual measurements 2.\ninterpolation or extrapolation in time 3. geographic area estimation 4. estimates prior to 1950 based upon knowledge of ore bodies, ventilation practices, and earliest measurements.\nThese methods will subsequently be called Methods 1,2,3,and 4. In assessing the error associated with individual exposure determinations, it is first necessary to consider the variability introduced by each of the four methods.\n\n【173】 # A. Magnitude of Error in Exposure Data\n\n【174】 # Method 1\n provides a frequency count of white miners working underground from 1950-68 and the mean number of samples taken in each mine visited in those years. The Kusnetz procedure for measuring radon daughters was most often used during the period of study (Johnson and Schiager . This is an area monitoring method based on alpha counts collected on a filter/pump apparatus.\nThe resulting data were generally thought to be of good quality .\nData from mines in which 5 or more measurements were taken in a given year were analyzed.\nThese data followed a lognormal distribution with little change over the period 1951-1968. Prior to 1960 were taken largely by the U.S. Public Health Service, while post-1960 sampling was conducted by state mine inspectors.\nTherefore, data were separated into pre and post 1960 periods and estimates of the coefficient of variation (CV) were made for each period. Results indicated a slight but non-significant increase in CV's after 1960 (106.6% vs 118.3%).\nSince the measurements were grab samples taken at different times within each mine, the total pooled CV=112.5% over the period 1951-1968 is assumed to include sampling errors, counting errors, and environmental fluctuations over time. This estimate agrees well with the CV of 110% found in an independent study of U.S. mines in the period 1973-79 when exposure levels were much lower .\nIn other studies, however, an average CV of 30% was reported for area samples in Canadian mines (Makepeace and Stocker  while fluctuations of 20-30% around daily means were found for radon measurements in non-uranium Norwegian mines (Berteig and Stranden .\n\n【175】 # Method 2\nIn order to assess the error in interpolating for gaps in sampling of 1 to 3 years, a simulation procedure was used.\nMines having the longest periods of continuous annual measurements were identified.\nThen the even years' averages wee omitted and the average of the two adjacent years was substituted.\nIn this way it was possible to compare the observed annual average with the expected average had that year been missing.\nThis strategy was repeated by imposing three year gaps in the data and again using the average of adjacent years to estimate the three intervening years.\nThe error variance attributo Method 2 was then calculated by:\n0 2 , S dofliOj/E.»2 i N-1\nwhere 0j = actual measurements for intervening years Ej = interpolated values estimated by average of adjacent years.\nThe resulting CV was 120.8% for 1 year interpolation and 137.3% for 3 year interpolation. Since these results were not significantly different, they were pooled to yield a CV=131.9%.\n\n【176】 # Method 3\nThis method used annual mine averages in the same geographic locality to estimate radon daughter levels in mines for which Methods 1 and 2 could not be used.\nIn order to assess the error associated with this method, four of the uranium mining localities with the greatest number of annual measurements were selected. A simulation procedure similar to that used for Method 2 was employed.\nAnnual averages for selected mines in these localities were omitted for 1 to 4 years. The averages for mines in the nearest district were substituted as the expected radon level if the annual average actually had been missing.\nThe error variance was calculated in the same way as Method 2. The resulting CV was 148.6% for this method.\n\n【177】 # Method 4\nNo measurements were available in the period prior to 1950.\nTherefore, the estimates made using knowledge of ore bodies, ventilation, and earliest known measurements in these mines could not be verified. These estimates comprised less than 6% of the 34,120 annual averages used in exposure assessment.\nIn addition, since only 8 percent of the total underground exposure time for the cohort occurred prior to 1950, the influence of these measurements should be minimal. However, since the error for this method was probably the greatest of the methods used, we estimated the overall CV for Method 4 to be 25% greater than that for Method 3, i.e. CV=186%.\n shows the number of annual averages for each of the four methods. Actual measurements comprised only about 10% of the data.\nIn order to obtain an overall estimate of the relative error, a weighted average of the CV's for each method was calculated based on the number of determinations for each method. The resulting overall CV=137%.\nThe error associated with each miner's cumulative exposure can then be calculated using our estimate of the error in each radon daughter level (WL). The total cumulative exposure (WLM) for each miner is obtained from: wlm = S ( « -¡jH u a io v , j where WL j j is the estimated exposure for mine i in year j and UGMONjj is the number of months spent underground in mine i during year j. The variance of WLM assuming independence of WL j j is then:\nVar(WLM) = X (UGMON..)2 var (WL..) i , j 1J 1J = 2 (UGMON..)2 (CV)2 (WL..)2 . . iJ ij ' -J 1 1\nwhere CV is the coefficient of variation for the estimated exposure WL j j .\nIf we substitute our estimate of the overall CV=137% and use total cumulative exposure divided by total months underground (WLM/TOTMON) as an estimate of WL j j for each individual miner, the average CV for cumulative exposure (WLM) is 0.97 or a relative standard deviation of 97% of the total WLM for each miner. Since radon daughter measurements were taken in different areas of each mine and often at different times of the day or week, we will assume that the variance in these measurements reflects the variance in exposure levels among individual miners, i.e.\n\n【178】 # Var(»LMij).\nwhere 0jj|< = variance in exposure measurement for miner k in mine i and year j .\n\n【179】 # B. E ffe c t on R ela tiv e Risk Estimation of Exposure Measurement Errors\nThere appears to be a general impression that errors in exposure measurements usually cause an underestimation of relative risk. Indeed, Bross  originally demonstrated that if misclassification was equal in two comparison populations, one would tend to underestimate differences in proportions of diseased persons. Keys and Kihlberg  qualified this concept by showing that relative risk is underestimated when misclassification errors are independent of disease and exposure relationships.\nIn general, it has been shown by Copeland et a l .  among others, that relative risk estimates are biased too low in the presence of non differential misclassification (equal misclassification of disease in both exposed and unexposed groups).\nLittle work has been done concerning the effects of errors in continuous measures of exposure upon relative risk estimates obtained from statistical models.\nIt is this situation that is a potential problem to the analysis in this report. Prentice  introduced a method for dealing with errors in individual exposure measures when using the Cox proportional hazards model.\nPrentice, and more recently Hornung , have shown that the direction of bias in relative risk estimation depends upon the error distribution and the shape of the exposure-response model.\nIn general, when the variability in individual exposure errors increases with the level of exposure and the relative risk model is supra-linear (curving upward), relative risk will actually be overestimated when exposure errors are ignored.\nThe popular log-1 inear or exponential risk function is an example of a model which may often overestimate relative risk in the presence of errors whose magnitude increases with increasing levels of cumulative exposure.\nAs was reported earlier, the log-linear model did not provide the best fit to the data.\nInstead, the power function model which involved the logarithms of cumulative exposure and cumulative cigarette smoking provided a better fit.\nThe effect upon risk estimates using this model was investigated when errors in exposure are lognormal as indicated in the previous section.\nWithout presenting the statistical details, it is sufficient to say that under these conditions (power function model and lognormal distribution of exposure errors) the effect upon relative risk estimates is negligible.\nIf the exposure measurements were generally higher than those actually experienced by the miners, as mentioned in the 1971 Monograph, relative risk per WLM would be underestimated regardless of the distribution of exposure measurement errors.\nIn summary, the degree of error in individual exposure measurements was quite high, an estimated CV of 97%. If, however, these individual errors were lognormally distributed about the annual average concentration in each mine, the degree of bias in relative risk estimates generated by the power function model would be minimal.\nRegardless of the form of the error distribution, the relative risks generated by the exposure-response model would be too low if the exposure measurements were systematically too high. Therefore, examination of the pattern of error in the exposure data would suggest that relative risks produced by the power function model are either unbiased or possibly a bit low.\n\n【180】 # V. QUANTITATIVE RISK ESTIMATES\nThe previous sections have outlined the protocol for the risk model development, the selection of an appropriate quantitative risk model, the temporal factors influencing risk estimation, and the magnitude and effect of exposure measurement errors.\nThese are factors requiring careful study before attempting to make valid quantitative risk estimates.\nIn most risk assessments, results are reported relative to some unexposed population.\nIn animal studies, a control group is generally used for this purpose.\nIn life , analyses expected mortality is obtained from some standard population, often that of the U.S.\nThe problems inherent with the use of such external referents have been well documented . Although a subcohort of miners unexposed to radon daughters would be ideal for a referent group, there were no unexposed miners in the U.S. cohort. Since the proportional hazards model uses internal comparisons in generating risk estimates, risk projections relative to an unexposed population necessarily involve an extrapolation to zero exposure.\nIn the case of the power function model, a background exposure of 0.2 WLM/year of age was added to every miner's cumulative total.\nAll risk estimates are relative to someone exposed to these background rates. Therefore, quantitative relative risk estimates are somewhat sensitive to the choice of a background exposure rate.\nOne way of checking the appropriateness of the model is to divide cumulative exposure into discrete intervals and calculate lung cancer risks in each interval relative to risks experienced in the lowest interval.\nIn this way, relative risk estimates are free of any exposure-response function.\nIf the risk model then fits the risk estimates in the selected intervals, one would be assured that the model is appropriate for quantitative risk estimation.\n\n【181】 Risk estimates in each interval are calculated relative to the risk in the interval less than 20 WLM. and are plotted at the mean exposure in each interval: 66.6, 179, 351, 698, 1352, 2579, and 5416 WLM, respectively.\n illustrates how these interval estimates are uniformly lower than those produced by the risk model when using 0.2 WLM/year as a background rate of exposure. The shape of the risk model, however, shows remarkably good agreement with the pattern of relative risk estimates in the selected intervals.\nThis implies that the quantitative risk model is appropriate exclusive of the intercept.\nThis could be due to either an improper choice of baseline exposure rate or the fact that all interval estimates are relative to exposure in the lowest interval, 0-20 WLM.\nIf there is some level of excess risk in this interval relative to an actual unexposed population, the interval estimates would be too low.\nThe cumulative exposure of 0.2 WLM/year is an estimate is an estimate of the background exposure in the overall U.S. population , Exposures near ore-bearing lands are known to be considerably higher than average .\nTherefore, it is probable that background exposures in the Colorado Plateau area are higher than average U.S. levels.\n\n【182】 # DOTTED LINES AND VERTICAL BARS REPRESENT 95% CONFIDENCE LIMITS\nIn the interest of using a background more in line with exposures received by persons living in the Colorado Plateau, the background exposure was increased to 0.4 WLM/year. This produced a quantitative risk model that agreed very well with the interval estimates, as can be seen in \nUsing this model, relative risk estimates were calculated for cumulative radon daughter exposures in the range 30 to 120 WLM corresponding to exposure levels of from one to four WLM/year over a 30-year working lifetime.\nThese estimates range from a relative risk of 1.42 at 30 WLM to 2.07 at 120 WLM compared to someone of the same age and smoking habits with a cumulative lifetime background exposure of 24 WLM and a background exposure rate of 0.4 WLM/year.\nThese estimates (0.9 to 1.4 excess relative risk per 100 WLM) are slightly higher than those reported by Muller  for the Ontario miners, but somewhat less than the estimates of Radford and Renard  for the Swedish iron miners.\nObviously, these estimates are subject to the usual caveats concerning extrapolation from higher cumulative exposures and exposure rates.\nBecause relatively few data are currently available in this cohort below 120 WLM (10 lung cancer deaths out of 709 miners), there may be some doubt that the model used actually is appropriate at these low levels.\nHowever, the pattern of relative risk estimates produced in each of the categorized exposure levels would suggest that this model fits the data well in range of 60 to 6000 WLM.\n\n【183】 # Magnitude and Effect of Errors in Exposure Measurements\nAnalyses of the errors associated with the four methods of estimating uranium mine exposure levels indicated a lognormal distribution of errors with the relative standard deviation or CV=97 percent.\nAlthough errors of this magnitude may cause overestimation of relative risk when using the log-linear risk model, the better-fitting power function model is generally insensitive to errors of this type.\nIn fact, if estimated exposure levels were systematically higher than those actually received by the miners , relative risks per unit WLM would be underestimated for this data.\n\n【184】 # Q u a n tita tiv e Risk Estimates\nPresent day radon daughter exposures are considerably less than those experienced in the past by uranium miners.\n current interest in low-level exposure to the general population from indoor radon and its decay products.\nConsequently, the primary cumulative exposure range of interest in risk assessment appears to be below 120 WLM. Although approximately 20 percent of the cumulative exposures in this study were below this level, there have been only 10 lung cancer deaths among this subgroup as of the end of 1982. Until this cohort is followed to extinction, epidemiologic models such as that produced in this report will be necessary to evaluate the risk of lung cancer mortality at these lower exposures.\nThe model developed for this report provides a very good fit to the data in the range 60 to 6000 WLM.\nIt seems reasonable that predictions based upon this model would be reliable at least for occupational exposure to adult white males.\nThere is little or no mortality data available regarding women and children.\nThe risk estimates provided in  are presented as an evaluation based upon careful consideration of all factors thought to influence such long-term mortality studies.\nAll of the caveats associated with such evaluations apply to some degree to these results. Exclusive of background exposure. 2Risks are calculated using exposure rate interaction model in  relative to miners of the same age and smoking habits with a cumulative lifetime background exposure of 24 WLM and background exposure rate of 0.4 WLM/year.\n\n【185】 # APPENDIX III\n\n【186】 # A. Introduction\nThis appendix contains examples of engineering control methods that can be used to reduce miners' exposure to radon progeny in underground uranium mines, although the same methods are applicable to other hard rock mines. Many of these control methods have been traditionally used in uranium mines, yet only recently have researchers (primarily from the Bureau of Mines) studied the efficacy of these methods .\n\n【187】 # B. Meehan i caI Vent i I a t i on\nMechanical ventilation is the primary and most successful technique for reducing exposure to radon progeny. Average measurements of 2 to 200 working levels (WL) of radon progeny were common in U.S. uranium mines during the early 1950's before mechanical ventilation became prevalent .\n successfully reduced radon progeny concentrations in mines with improved mechanical ventilation; the average annual exposure for nonuranium miners in Sweden decreased from 4.7 working level months (WLM) in 1970 to 0.7 WLM in 1980 .\n\n【188】 # General P rin c ip le s\nDilution ventilation in large mines consists of primary and secondary ventilation systems.\nIn the primary system, fresh air is brought into the mine either through separate air shafts or through mine entrances used for miner access and equipment transport. The air can be blown in by a fan located at the surface or drawn in by a fan located inside the mine. Once in the mine, the air is blown or drawn through the main active passageways and then is pushed or drawn out of the mine through special ventilation shafts or openings used to remove ore.\nThe secondary or auxiliary ventilation system provides fresh air to miners working in areas that include stopes and faces where access comes from a single shaft or drift and thus the work area is a dead end. For these areas, the air is often removed through the same shaft that was used to bring in the air. The source of fresh air for the secondary system is provided from the primary air system in the main passageway.\n be brought back to the main passageway through a second duct and fan system. Once returned to the main passageway, the contaminated air joins the primary exhaust air stream which is then carried out of the mine.\n\n【189】 # Designing a Dilution Ventilation System\nVentilation requirements must be considered when planning and designing the mine. Adding mine ventilation as an afterthought once the mine has been designed or completed is usually more expensive and less efficient. Consideration should be given to the following when designing the ventilation plan for a mine :\n- Identify the outline of the ore body that will be mined;\n- Determine the rate of emanation of radon from the rock in which the ore occurs;\n- Place as much of the primary ventilation system as possible including entrances and passageways in barren ground (i.e., ground not containing ore);\n- Set up passageways so that a split or parallel system of ventilation can be used;\n- Set up the mine so that working faces ventilated in a series are minimized;\n- Design the mine so that air inlets are located on one side of the ore body and exhaust airways on the opposite side of the ore body;\n- Design the mine so that the distances ventilation air travels in the mine are minimized (reduce or eliminate reentrainment and short ci rcui ts);\n- Design the mine so that adequate volumes of air can be provided without having high pressure drops across air controls in haulage and production areas;\n- Design the ventilation system to account for increasing concentrations of radon gas, and therefore radon progeny, since as the mine ages there will be more surface area for gas exchange into the mine; and\n- Consider control devices, fans, push-pull systems, and minimizing leaks when designing the system. The primary ventilation system delivers fresh air for the secondary air system and removes contaminated air from the secondary air system. The design of the primary air system is discussed in the following paragraphs.\na. S p lit or P a ra lle l V e n tila tio n Systems A \"split\" or \"parallel\" ventilation system involves providing all or just a few working areas with fresh air that has not been previously used to ventilate other working areas. After the working areas are ventilated, the air is then pushed or drawn back into the primary system where it is moved out of the mine. By contrast, in a \"series\" ventilation system, all areas are ventilated by a single continuous air circuit.\nThe advantages of a split or parallel system include the reduction of both the residence time and cumulative air contamination . A series system, on the other hand, has several disadvantages.\nIn addition to its long residence air times and a cumulative build-up of air contaminants from one area to another, other disadvantages include the following:\n- High air velocities which are often required;\n- Higher power costs associated with moving air at high velocities because of increased static pressures, unless additional ventilation shafts are constructed ; and\n- The potential spread of toxic gases to all areas of the mine in the event of a fi re.\n be necessary.\n\n【190】 # b. Control Devices\n be well-constructed to remain secure with repeated usage; steel doors in substantial frames are most commonly used in Canada .\n\n【191】 # c. Pushing Versus P u llin g V e n tila tio n Systems\nThe pressure on the air intake side of a mine is always greater than on the exhaust side regardless of whether a pushing or pulling ventilation system is used. The difference is that the intake side\n\n【192】 # Primary Ventilation System\npressure is greater than atmospheric pressure for a pushing system, whereas in an exhaust or pulling system, the pressure on the intake side is below atmospheric pressure.\nExhausting (pulling) offers some advantages over a pushing system. For example, forcing air into haulageways and escape areas often requires air locks and other equipment. Exhaust systems draw air from these locations without the need for air locks and remove air from the mine through special airways to exhaust fans.\n\n【193】 # . Secondary ( A u x ilia r y ) V e n tila tio n System\nThe secondary (auxiliary) ventilation system brings sufficient fresh air to the working area from the primary air system without mixing it with the returning contaminated air from the face.\n\n【194】 # a .\nUse o f Ducts  Another advantage of an air-blowing system is that it increases pressure. Measurements of radon gas content in air exhausted from mines have shown that the radon gas emitted into the atmosphere was 20% less with the air-blowing system than with an exhaust system . This indicates that less radon gas diffused into the ventilated areas when an air-blowing system was utilized than when an exhaust system was used.\n\n【195】 # c . Exhaust Duct System (P u ll System)\nIn the exhausting or pulling system, contaminated air is drawn from the working face by a duct that runs from the face to the main passageway in the primary air system through the access tunnel. Fresh air is then drawn into the access tunnel toward the work area by the pressure gradient created by removing air. Exhausting (pulling) air from the face instead of blowing (pushing) offers the fo 11ow i ng advan tages:\n- Fresh incoming air is maintained in the tunnel used by miners to access the active stope, and\n\n【196】 # d . Push-Pu11 System\nA push-pull system contains two ducts in the accessway, one for pushing clean air to the face and the other for exhausting air from the face back to the primary air system. This system has many of the advantages of both the push and the pull systems including the following:\n- The blowing of air that sweeps across and ventilates the active face, thus providing good dilution in work areas;\n- The efficient collection of contaminants near the work face; and\n- Reducing the contamination of air in the access tunnel.\nThe main disadvantages are the cost and that it occupies more drift area .\nThe amount of radon gas diffusing into mine spaces from interstitial rock is dependent on the pressure in the mine space. The lower the atmospheric pressure in the mine space as compared to the pressure in the interstitial rock, the more radon gas will pass from the rock to the mine space. Conversely, the greater the pressure in the mine space as compared to the rock, the less radon gas will seep into the mine space. Overpressurization and mine pumping are two control measures which take advantage of this principle to reduce concentrations of radon gas.\nIn overpressurization, more ventilation air is pushed into mine spaces than is removed. Although Edwards and Bates  have stated \"nothing that we have found provides mining companies with sufficient guidelines for applying the overpressurized ventilation system effectively,\" they conducted a mathematical study of overpressurization and drew the following conclusion: overpressurization does decrease the radon flux. It was estimated that a 2% pressure differential in a sandstone matrix would result in a 50% reduction in radon flux with mine sink lengths of 100 meters or less. A mine sink is an area either in the mine itself or a naturally occurring space or lattice in the matrix where the interstitial air can flow.\nIf the distance between the sink and the mine space approaches 200 meters, the benefit of overpressurization is lost. Because of the dramatic increase in radon gas in the sink area during overpressurization of work areas, no miners should be allowed in those sinks without proper respiratory protection. However, many open spaces that can serve as sinks are filled in and cannot be occupied.\nThe Bureau of Mines is gathering information on the effects of overpressurization in mines. Data from the pressurization of an enclosed chamber in a mine indicated that the radon concentration was 99% lower than the concentration under static conditions and 92% lower than the concentration under controlled ventilation conditions ,\nIn a study by Schroeder et al .  of mine areas that were pressurized by 10 mm of mercury, the radon flux decreased from 5 to 20 fold as compared to normal ventilation conditions.\nIn mine pumping, a negative pressure is created in the mine space by sealing air intake openings and permitting the exhaust fans to operate. This is done during an offshift when no miners are in the mine. Because of the negative pressure created in the mine with respect to the surrounding rock, radon is drawn into the mine space from the inter stitial rock at a rate higher than would occur under static conditions. The air intakes must be opened well before miners enter the mine to permit the ventilation system to remove the radon gas and radon progeny that have accumulated in the mine spaces. After this accumulation has been removed, the mine spaces should have lower concentrations of radon gas (and therefore radon progeny) when the miners reenter the mine. This is because much of the radon gas in the surrounding interstitial rock has been removed and is not available to diffuse into the mine working areas. However, monitoring of these areas would be required prior to allowing miners to enter. More studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of this control procedure .\n\n【197】 # Overpressurization and Mine Pumping\n\n【198】 # activities.\nSummers  tested the efficacy of this procedure and found that the amount of radon gas escaping through the surrounding rock was insufficient to warrant the uniform use of a wall sealant, provided that all cracks, fissures, and holes were sealed to prevent major leaks.\n\n【199】 # . Membrane S ealants Used on Bulkheads\n\n【200】 # . N egative A ir Pressure Behind a Bulkhead\nA slight negative pressure behind the bulkhead of about 0.03 cm water with respect to active areas will prevent radon gas leaks into fresh ventilation air [Thomas 1981   covering the backfill with one meter of clean sand,  sealing the surface of the tailings,  using a bulkhead to seal the backfilled stope and maintaining a negative pressure behind the bulkhead, and  using nonradioactive materials as backfill instead of mill tai Iings.\n\n【201】 # . E ffic ie n c y\nIn summary, backfilling with uranium tailings can be as effective as bulkheading in reducing radon progeny emissions, although it is more costly. Because high radon progeny concentrations are emitted from wet backfill and during the backfilling process, backfilling should not be used in active mine areas and miners should be protected from overexposure during backfilling operations.\n\n【202】 # E. S ealants Used on Mine W alls\nThis section describes sealants used as diffusion barriers against radon gas, including how the sealants are applied and the best materials used as sealants. Also, the effectiveness of sealants for reducing radon emanation and exposure will be discussed.\n\n【203】 # G. Automation\nAnother radon progeny control method is increased automation.\nTechniques such as robotics that minimize the time the miner spends in the high exposure areas of the mine and in activities such as drilling, blasting, or loading ore, will decrease the miner's radiation exposure. Although, at present, robotics has a limited place in the mines, it may be possible in the future to further automate the ore mining process.\n1. Two different sampling days are randomly selected from each 2-week block of t ime.\n2. The stations within a cluster are to be sampled on the same workdays and work shifts. All stations within a cluster are to be alternately sampled, seven times on each sampling day, each time in independent random order. During the work shift, the seven periods for sampling of the entire cluster shall be equally spaced in time. For example, the three stations A, B, and C could be considered a cluster and sampled as ABC, BCA, ACB, CBA, CAB, BAC, and ACB during seven successive intervals of approximately equal durations.\nIf it is not feasible to sample in this manner, then sampling can be conducted along the most efficient path but with a different, randomly determined starting point on each day (e.g., BCA, BCA,\\., BCA during one sampling day and ABC, ABC,\\., ABC or CAB, CAB,\\., CAB during other sampling days).\n3. The estimated average work shift concentration (ftj) for each sampling day (i = 1,2,\\. is computed from an analysis of the seven grab samples taken on that day. Formulae for this computation are contained in section G. 4. Whenever a; for a particular station exceeds 0.14 WL, then that station shall be resampled the next workday.\n[Note:\nIn this case, f t ; = and sampling on the \"next workday\" (day B) is in addition to the two randomly selected sampling days required in a 2-week block of time.] a.\n exceeds 0.14 WL, then:\n steps shall be taken to reduce the radon progeny concentration in that work area by implementing work practices and engineering controls,  respiratory protection shall be required for all miners entering that work area, and  grab sampling as described in section C,2 shall be conducted on a consecutive daily basis.\nGrab sampling shall continue on a consecutive daily basis until the estimated average work shift concentrations on any two consecutive workdays (ft^ and are both < 0.10 WL. When and are both < 0.10 WL, then the requirements for respiratory protection are waived and exposure monitoring can revert to the schedule described starting at section C ,1.  This criterion (as discussed in section H, serves to provide early confirmation that the corrective steps taken by the mine operator have been effective in limiting the average work shift concentration of radon progeny to a level not exceeding 1.5 times the recommended exposure limit (REL) of 1/12 WL.\n\n【204】 # G. Statistical Considerations and Data Analysis Formulae\nThe following are the statistical notations used in the sampling strategy: Cjj = measured concentration of radon progeny in the jth grab sample taken on the ith sampling day, where j = 1,2,\\.,7 for each day and i = 1,2,\\.,12 (2 workdays selected at random from each of six consecutive blocks of time).\n\n【205】 # c>\\j\n= measured concentration of radon progeny in the jth grab sample taken on day A, where j = 1,2,\\.,7.\n\n【206】 # CBj\n made when the 95% lower confidence limit for the long-term average work shift concentration (LCL) exceeds 1/12 WL  section D,.\n\n【207】 # Return to Compliance with the REL\n has the advantage of permitting an early return to normal operations after a period of corrective actions to reduce exposure concentrations, at the expense of having less than high confidence that the REL is not being exceeded by more than 50%. However, only a small proportion of time passes until the next sampling day (as specified in the sampling strategy relative to the year), so that the 2-day rule limits the contribution of a temporarily excessive exposure in a work area to a miner's cumulative annual exposure.\nAt a later time, the lower confidence limit criterion for noncompliance determined after 12 randomly selected sampling days (i.e., LCL > 1/12 WL) would be likely to detect a statistically significant increase above the REL if the long-term average work shift concentration were as high as 0.125 WL.\n\n【208】 # Less Frequent Exposure Monitoring\nThe upper confidence limit criterion (i.e., UCL < 1/12 WL) gives 95% confidence that the long-term average work shift concentration is not above 1/12 WL, under the assumption that aj's exhibit log-normally distributed random variations.\nThe additional requirement that &j and &j+i do not exceed 0.14 WL is meant to detect a temporarily or periodically high average work shift concentration (i.e., high aj's that are not sustained for the full block of time from which 12 sampling days were selected). When both of these requirements are met, only 2 randomly selected sampling days are then required per 26-week block of t ime.\n\n【209】 # Cessation of Exposure Monitoring\n2 0 2 reported . However, several recent studies suggest that this is not a practical concern, at least not in healthy individuals .\nTheoretically, the increased fluctuations in thoracic pressure caused by breathing with a respirator might constitute an increased risk to subjects with a history of spontaneous pneumothorax.\nFew data are available in this area. While an individual is using a negative-pressure respirator with relatively high resistance during very heavy exercise, the usual maximal-peak negative oral pressure during inhalation is about 15-17 cm of water . Similarly, the usual maximal-peak positive oral pressure during exhalation is about 15-17 cm of water, which might occur with a respirator in a positive-pressure mode, again during very heavy exercise . By comparison, maximal positive pressures such as those during a vigorous cough can generate 200 cm of water pressure . The normal maximal negative pleural pressure at full inspiration is -40 cm of water , and normal subjects can generate -80 to -160 cm of negative water pressure . Thus while vigorous exercise with a respirator does alter pleural pressures, the risk of barotrauma would seem to be substantially less than that of coughing.\nIn some asthmatics, an asthmatic attack may be exacerbated or induced by a variety of factors including exercise, cold air, and stress, all of which may be associated with wearing a respirator. While most asthmatics who are able to control their condition should not have problems with respirators, a physician's judgment and a field trial may be needed in selected cases.\n\n【210】 # Cardiac E ffe c ts\nThe added work of breathing from respirators is small and could not be detected in several studies . A typical respirator might double the work of breathing (from 3% to 6% of the total oxygen consumption), but this is probably not of clinical significance .\nIn concordance with this view, several other studies indicated that at the same workloads heart rate does not change with the wearing of a respirator .\nIn contrast, the added cardiac stress due to the weight of a heavy respirator may be considerable.\nA self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) may weigh up to 35 pounds.\nHeavier respirators can reduce maximum external workloads by 20% and similarly increase heart rate at a given submaximal workload .\n necessitate the wearing of 10-25 pounds of protective clothing.\n\n【211】 # Miscellaneous Health Effects\n occur without contact lenses, their presence is known to substantially increase this risk.\n\n【212】 # . Loss or Misplacement of a Contact Lens\nThe loss or misplacement of a contact lens by an individual wearing a respirator might prompt the wearer to remove the respirator, thereby resulting in exposure to the hazard as well as to the potential problems noted above.\n\n【213】 #  Eye Irritation from Respirator Airflow\nThe constant airflow of some respirators, such as powered air-purifying respirators (PAPR's) or continuous flow air-line respirators, might irritate the eyes of a contact lens wearer.\n\n【214】 # B. Suggested Medical E valu atio n and C r i t e r i a f o r R e s p ira to r Use\nThe following NIOSH recommendations allow latitude for the physician in determining a medical evaluation for a specific situation. More specific guidelines may become available as knowledge increases regarding human stresses from the complex interactions of worker health status, respirator usage, and job tasks. While some of the following recommendations should be part of any medical evaluation of workers who wear respirators, others are applicable for specific situations.\n- A physician should determine fitness to wear a respirator by considering the worker's health, the type of respirator, and the conditions of respirator use.\nThe recommendation above leaves the final decision of an individual's fitness to wear a respirator to the person who is best qualified to evaluate the multiple clinical and other variables. Much of the clinical and other data could be gathered by other personnel.\nIt should be emphasized that the clinical examination alone is only one part of the fitness determination. Collaboration with foremen, industrial hygienists, and others may often be needed to better assess the work conditions and other factors that affect an individual's fitness to wear a respirator.\n- A medical history and at least a limited physical examination are recommended.\nThe medical history and physical examination should emphasize the evaluation of the cardiopulmonary system and should elicit any history of respirator use. The history is an important tool in medical diagnosis and can be used to detect most problems that might require further evaluation. Objectives of the physical examination should be to confirm the clinical impression based on the history and to detect important medical conditions (such as hypertension) that may be essentially asymptomatic.\n- While chest X-ray and/or spirometry may be medically indicated in some fitness determinations, these should not be routinely performed.\n mandate periodic chest X-rays and/or spirometry for exposed workers. When such information is available, it should be used in the determination of fitness to wear respirators.\nData from routine chest X-rays and spirometry are not recommended solely for determining if a respirator should be worn. In most cases, with an essentially normal clinical examination (history and physical) these data are unlikely to influence the respirator fitness determination; additionally, the X-ray would be an unnecessary source of radiation exposure to the worker. Chest X-rays in general do not accurately reflect a person's cardiopulmonary physiologic status, and limited studies suggest that mild to moderate impairment detected by spirometry would not preclude the wearing of respirators in most cases. Thus it is recommended that chest X-rays and/or spirometry be done only when clinically indicated.\n- The recommended periodicity of medical fitness determinations varies according to several factors but could be as infrequent as every 5 years.\nFederal or other applicable regulations shall be followed regarding the frequency of respirator fitness determinations. The guidelines for most work conditions for which respirators are required are shown in - The respirator wearer should be observed during a trial period to evaluate potential physiological problems.\nIn addition to considering the physical effects of wearing respirators, the physician should determine if wearing a given respirator would cause extreme anxiety or claustrophobic reaction in the individual. This could be done during training while the worker is wearing the respirator and is engaged in some exercise that approximates the actual work situation.\n\n【215】 - Examining physicians should realize that the main stress of heavy exercise while using a respirator is usually on the cardiovascular system and that heavy respirators (e.g., SCBA) can substantially increase this stress. Accordingly, physicians may want to consider exercise stress tests with electrocardiographic monitoring when heavy respirators are used, when cardiovascular risk factors are present, or when extremely stressful conditions are expected.\n be aware of other added stresses, such as heavy protective clothing and intense ambient heat, that would increase the worker's cardiac demand. As an extreme example, firefighters who use a SCBA inside burning buildings may work at maximal exercise levels under life-threatening conditions.\nIn such cases, the detection of occult cardiac disease, which might manifest itself during heavy stress, may be important. Some authors have either recommended stress testing  or at least its consideration in the fitness determination . Kilbom  has recommended stress testing at 5-year intervals for firefighters below age 40 who use SCBA and at 2-year intervals for those aged 40-50. He further suggested that firemen over age 50 not be allowed to wear SCBA. Exercise stress testing has not been recommended for medical screening for coronary artery disease in the general population .\nIt has an estimated sensitivity and specificity of 78% and 69%, respectively, when the disease is defined by coronary angiography ,\nIn a recent 6-year prospective study, stress testing to determine the potential for heart attacks indicated a positive predictive value of 27% when the prevalence of disease was 3.5% . While stress testing has limited effectiveness in medical screening, it could detect individuals who may not be able to complete the heavy exercise required in some jobs.\nA definitive recommendation regarding exercise stress testing cannot be made at this time. Further research may determine whether this is a useful tool in selected circumstances.\n shall apply for respirator use\" .\nIn many cases, if a worker is physically able to do an assigned job while not wearing a respirator, the worker will in most situations not be at increased risk when performing the same job while wearing a respirator.\n- Because of the variability in the types of respirators, work conditions, and workers' health status, many employers may wish to designate categories of fitness to wear respirators, thereby excluding some workers from strenuous work situations involving the wearing of respirators.\nDepending on the various circumstances, several permissible categories of respirator usage are possible. One conceivable scheme would consist of three overall categories: full respirator use, no respirator use, and limited respirator use including \"escape only\" respirators. The latter category excludes heavy respirators and strenuous work conditions. Before identifying the conditions that would be used to classify workers into various categories, it is critical that the physician be aware that these conditions have not been validated and are presented only for consideration. The physician should modify the use of these conditions based on actual experience, further research, and individual worker sensitivities.\n wish to consider the following conditions in selecting or permitting the use of respirators:\n-History of spontaneous pneumothorax; -CIaus t rophob i a/anxi ety reac t i on; -Use of contact lenses (for some respirators); -Moderate or severe pulmonary disease; -Angina pectoris, significant arrhythmias, recent myocardial infarction; -Symptomatic or uncontrolled hypertension; and -Advanced age.\nWearing a respirator would probably not play a significant role in causing lung damage such as pneumothorax.\nHowever, without good evidence that wearing a respirator would not cause such lung damage, the physician would be prudent to prohibit the individual with a history of spontaneous pneumothorax from wearing a respirator.\nModerate lung disease is defined by the Intermountain Thoracic Society  as being present when the following conditions exist-a forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV-|) divided by the forced vital capacity (FVC) (i.e., FEV-|/FVC) of 0.45 to 0.60, or an FVC of 51% to 65% of the predicted FVC value. Similar arbitrary limits could be set for age and hypertension.\nIt would seem more reasonable, however, to combine several risk factors into an overall estimate of fitness to wear respirators under certain conditions. Here the judgment and clinical experience of the physician are needed. Many impaired workers would even be able to work safely while wearing respirators if they could control their own work pace, including having sufficient time to rest.\n\n【216】 # C. Cone Ius ion\nIndividual judgment is needed to determine the factors affecting an individual's fitness to wear a respirator. While many of the preceding guidelines are based on limited evidence, they should provide a useful starting point for a respirator fitness screening program.\nFurther research is needed to validate these and other recommendations currently in use. Of particular interest would be laboratory studies involving physiologically impaired individuals and field studies conducted under actual day-to-day work condi t ions.\n\n【217】 # C E N T E R S F O R D IS E A S E C O N T R O L N A T IO N A L IN S T IT U T E F O R O C C U P A T IO N A L S A F E T Y A N D H E A L T H R O B E R T A .

This is especially true when considering an epidemiologic risk assessment.\nThere are a great variety of risk factors and temporal effects that may alter the interpretation of the data analysis.\nThis report is an attempt to address such modifying influences in an effort to better understand the underlying cancer mechanisms operative in the cohort of U.S. uranium mi daughters.\nThere were a number of findings which are important in lung cancer in the U.S. cohort.\nInfluence of C ig a re tte Smoking\nThe joint effect of cumulative cigarette smoking daughter exposure was found to be intermediate multiplicative.\nThis would imply a synergistic usual definition as an effect exceeding the sum risks.\n\n【225】 # Exposure-Rate E ffe c t\nAnalysis of this data revealed that modeling cumulative exposure alone may not adequately predict the relative risk of lung cancer from chronic exposure to radon daughters.\nMiners receiving a given amount of cumulative exposure at lower rates for longer periods of time were at greater risk relative to those with the same cumulative exposure received at higher rates for shorter periods of time.\nThis This implies that results extrapolated from historical exposures at high rates may yield conservative results at current lower rates.\nIndeed, it is possible that lower risk estimates in the U.S. study, when compared to the four other major radon studies, as reported by Thomas  may be due to the higher exposure rates received by U.S. miners.\n\n【226】 # Late-Stage Carcinogenic E ffect\nCareful examination of temporal effects implies that exposure to radon daughters acts at a late stage in the carcinogenic process.\nAll temporal factors agreed in this respect.\nThe appropriate lag to remove redundant exposure was a relatively short six years.\nOlder miners at initial exposure were at greater risk than those exposed at younger ages.\nThe relative risk of lung cancer decreases with the length of time after cessation of exposure.\nWhether or not the mathematical form of the multistage theory of carcinogenesis applies to this cohort, the temporal patterns are worth noting.\n\n【227】 # C. BuIkheads\n\n【228】 # D e s c rip tio n\nThe second most important control measure used in underground mines today is the construction of bulkheads across inactive stopes or drifts . Bulkheads isolate inactive stopes, prevent the mixture of contaminated air from these stopes with fresh air, and help control the direction of air flow to working areas.\nMaintaining a negative air pressure behind a bulkhead will prevent leaks ; this is important because radon progeny concentrations can exceed 1,000 WL behind a bulkhead .\nIn addition, bulkheads must be strong and flexible enough to maintain an airtight seal during typical mining conditions, such as the ground movement and air shocks from blasting and the impact from accidental contact with mining equipment.\n\n【229】 # A bulkhead consists of three functional parts:\n the primary structure,  the seal between the primary structure and the rock, and  a surface seal on the rock within one meter from the plane of the bulkhead [Summers 1982\nThe primary bulkhead structure fills most of the opening in the stope and provides resistance to shocks from blasting or contact with machinery.\nThe primary structure consists of timber or an expanded metal lath covered with a continuous non-porous membrane. The membrane may be attached to, or sprayed upon, the timber in the primary structure. The membrane must not crack or develop holes or leaks during mining activities .\nThe second part of the bulkhead, the seal between the primary structure and the surrounding rock, must resist running water and the air shocks and rock movements due to blasting.\nThe third part of the bulkhead, the seal on the surface of the rock within one meter from the plane of the bulkhead, must be made of a material that adheres to damp rock surfaces and can withstand mining 6. Fan Operation estimate that 100 bulkheads sealing 12.5 stopes would reduce the overall radon gas emissions into mine air by 2.25 Ci/day, a reduction of 25%.\nIn summary, bulkheads are very effective in reducing radon gas (and thus radon progeny) in mine air. Especially promising are the new bulkheads designed by Summers  and further tested by Bloomster . These bulkheads may eventually replace the leakier and more flammable polyurethane bulkheads presently being used underground.\n\n【230】 # D. Backf i11in q\nIn the uranium mining process, large quantities of ore are brought to the surface, leaving voids which may collapse if they are not stabilized.\nThe tailings remaining after the uranium is extracted are often used as backfill.\nThere are three benefits of backfilling stopes:\n ground stabilization, ( 2 Next, the coarse tailings \"sand' ' is mixed with water to form a slurry and pumped into worked-out stopes.\nSometimes the slurry is mixed with cement before pumping. After the water in the slurry percolates away, the stope is left filled with densely packed sand or cement.\n travel freely through fine pores in the cement, especially water-filled pores.\nIndeed, radon gas emanates from porous cement, sand, or ore at a higher rate when it is wet than when it is dry unless the dry material is overlain with a thick During experiments in a mine, Franklin  found that backfilling 90% of a stope reduced the total radon progeny emissions from the stope by 85%. A feasibility study estimated that backfilling can be as effective as problem unless there were several thousand visible pinholes per square meter of sealant.\n\n【231】 # E ffe c tiv e n e s s o f S ealants in Reducing Radon Emanation Rates\nThe effectiveness of sealants depends, in part, upon the porosity of the rock walls. Sealants produce the greatest decrease in radon emanation when applied to sandstone or other porous rock; sealants applied to granite will appear to be less effective because granite provides a natural barrier to radon emanation . Thus results from the tests for the effectiveness of sealants vary greatly depending on the porosity of the rock walls along with the mine ventilation rate, the grade of the uranium ore, and other factors. estimated that the overall decrease in radon emissions would be 56% if the same sealant coating was applied to 80% of the mine surfaces. Although sealants were less effective and more costly than bulkheads, the use of sealants is less disruptive to the mining process than the use of bulkheads .\nIn summary, there are at least seven materials available that make effective mine sealants. These materials can reduce radon emanation from mine walls by 50-75%.\n\n【232】 # F.

Miners' exposures must be limited to no more than 1.0 WLM per year and the average concentration of radon progeny in any work area must not exceed 1/12 WL during any work shift. The sampling strategy described here was developed after an evaluation of mine sampling data and the typical variability of radon progeny concentrations in underground mines. This strategy will allow the collection of timely and reliable environmental data that can be used as the basis for control of cumulative exposures.\n included for determination of a long-term arithmetic average work shift concentration.\nThe formulae needed to calculate the statistical quantities used in this sampling strategy are contained in section G of this appendix.

Criteria for Cessation of Exposure Monitoring\nSampling can be discontinued at a station if both of the following results occur at that station:\n\n【250】 # APPENDIX V\nIn recommending medical evaluation criteria for respirator use, one should apply rigorous decision-making principles ; tests used should be chosen for operating characteristics such as sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value. Unfortunately, many knowledge gaps exist in this area. The problem is complicated by the large variety of respirators, their conditions of use, and individual differences in the physiologic and psychologic responses to them. For these reasons, the following guidelines are to be considered as informed suggestions rather than established NIOSH policy recommendations.\nThey are intended primarily to assist the physician in developing medical evaluation criteria for respi rator use.\n\n【251】 # A. Background Info rm ation\n\n【252】 # Pulmonary E ffe c ts\nIn general, the added inspiratory and expiratory resistances and dead space of most respirators cause an increase in tidal volume and a decrease in respiratory rate and ventilation (including a small decrease in alveolar ventilation). These respirator effects have usually been small both among healthy individuals and, in limited studies, among individuals with impaired lung function . This generalization is applicable to most respirators when resistances (particularly expiratory resistance) are low . While most studies report minimal physiologic effects during submaximal exercise, the resistances commonly lead to reduced endurance and reduced maximal exercise performance . The dead space of a respirator (reflecting the amount of expired air that must be rebreathed before fresh air is obtained) tends to cause increased ventilation. At least one study has shown substantially increased ventilation with a full-face respirator, a type that can have a large effective dead space . However, the net effect of a respirator's added resistances and dead space is usually a small decrease in ventilation .\nThe potential for adverse effects, particularly decreased cardiac output, from the positive pressure feature of some respirators has been  Raven  found statistically significant higher systolic and/or diastolic blood pressures during exercise for persons wearing respirators. Arborelius  did not find significant differences for persons wearing respirators during exercise.\n\n【253】 # Body Temperature E ffe c ts\nProper regulation of body temperature is primarily of concern with the closed circuit SCBA that produces oxygen via an exothermic chemical reaction.\nInspired air within these respirators may reach 120°F (49°C), thus depriving the wearer of a minor cooling mechanism and causing discomfort. Obviously this can be more of a problem with heavy exercise and when ambient conditions and/or protective clothing further reduce the body's ability to lose heat. The increase in heart rate because of increasing temperature represents an additional cardiac stress.\n have this potential problem, again because of partial rebreathing of warmed expired air ,\n\n【254】 # . Sensory E ffe c ts\n contribute to a general feeling of stress .\n\n【255】 # Psychologic E ffe c ts\nThis important topic is discussed in recent reviews by Morgan [Morgan 1983a[Morgan , 1983b. There is little doubt that virtually everyone suffers some discomfort when wearing a respirator. The large variability and the subjective nature of the psycho-physiologic aspects of wearing a respirator, however, make studies and specific recommendations difficult.\nFit testing obviously serves an important additional function by providing a trial to determine if the wearer can psychologically tolerate the respirator. The great majority of workers can tolerate respirators, and experience in wearing them aids in this tolerance . However, some individuals are likely to remain psychologically unfit for wearing respirators.\n\n【256】 # . Local I r r i t a t i o n E ffe c ts\nAllergic skin reactions may occur occasionally from wearing a respirator, and skin occlusion may cause irritation or exacerbation of preexisting conditions such as pseudofolliculitis barbae. Facial discomfort from the pressure of the mask may occur, particularly when the fit is unsatisfactory.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

The Yellow Emperor is described as a famous general who, before becoming China’s leader, wrote lengthy treatises on medicine, astrology and the martial arts. He allegedly developed the practice of jiao di or horn-butting and utilized it in war. Regardless of these legends, jiao di evolved during the Zhou Dynasty (2nd millennium BCE) into a combat wrestling system called juélì or jiǎolì (角力)and was mentioned in the Classic of Rites. This combat system included techniques such as strikes, throws, joint manipulation, and pressure point attacks. Jiao li became a sport during the Qin Dynasty (221-207 BCE).  The Han History Bibliographies record that, by the Former Han (206 BCE – 8 CE), there was a distinction between no-holds-barred weaponless fighting, which it calls shǒubó (手搏), for which \"how-to\" manuals had already been written, and jiao li..  Jiao li is now known as shuai jiao in its modern form.\nSophisticated theories of martial arts based on the opposing ideas of yin and yang, and the integration of \"hard\" and \"soft\" techniques are recorded in the annals of the Spring and Autumn Period (722–481 BCE).\nIn the Tang Dynasty, descriptions of sword dances were immortalized in poems by Li Bai. In the Song and Yuan dynasties, xiangpu (the earliest form of sumo) contests were sponsored by the imperial courts. The modern concepts of wushu were fully developed by the Ming and Qing dynasties.\n mentioned in Chinese philosophy. Passages in the Zhuangzi (庄子), a Daoist text, pertain to the psychology and practice of martial arts. Zhuangzi, its eponymous author, is believed to have lived in the 4th century BCE. The Tao Te Ching, often credited to Lao Zi, is another Daoist text that contains principles applicable to martial arts. According to one of the classic texts of Confucianism, Zhou Li (周禮/周礼),\nArchery and charioteering were part of the \"six arts\" (Template:Zh-tsp, including rites, music, calligraphy and mathematics) of the Zhou Dynasty (1122-256 BCE). The Art of War ( 孫子兵法), written during the 6th century BCE by Sun Tzu ( 孫子), deals directly with military warfare but contains ideas that are used in the Chinese martial arts. Those examples shows that over time, the ideas associated with Chinese martial arts changed with the evolving Chinese society and over time acquired philosophical basis.\nTaoist practitioners have been practicing Tao Yin, physical exercises similar to Qigong that was one of the progenitors to Tai Chi Chuan, at least as early as 500 BCE. In 39-92 CE, \"Six Chapters of Hand Fighting\", were included in the Han Shu (history of the Former Han Dynasty) written by Pan Ku. Also, the noted physician, Hua Tuo, composed the \"Five Animals Play\" - tiger, deer, monkey, bear, and bird, around 220 BCE Taoist philosophy and their approach to health and exercise migth have influeced to certain extent the Chinese martial arts.\nWith regards to the Shaolin style of martial arts, the oldest evidence of Shaolin participation in combat is a stele from 728 CE that attests to two occasions: a defense of the Shaolin Monastery from bandits around 610 CE, and their subsequent role in the defeat of Wang Shichong at the Battle of Hulao in 621 CE From the 8th to the 15th centuries, there are no extant documents that provide evidence of Shaolin participation in combat. However, between the 16th and 17th centuries there are at least forty extant sources which provided evidence that, not only did monks of Shaolin practice martial arts, but martial practice had become such an integral element of Shaolin monastic life that the monks felt the need to justify it by creating new Buddhist lore.\n\n【2】 These sources, in contrast to those from the Tang period, refer to Shaolin methods of armed combat. This include the forte of Shaolin monks and for which they had become famous — the staff (Gun, pronounced as juen); General Qi Jiquan included these techniques in his book, Treatise of Effective Discipline. Despite the fact that others critized the techniques, Ming General Yu Dayou visited the Temple and was not impressed with what he saw, he recruited three monks who he would train for few years after which they returned to the temple to train his fellow monks..\nThe fighting styles that are practiced today were developed over the centuries, after having incorporated forms that came into existence later. Some of these include Bagua, Drunken Boxing, Eagle Claw, Five Animals, Hsing I, Hung Gar, Lau Gar, Monkey, Praying Mantis, Fujian White Crane, Wing Chun and Tai Chi Chuan.\nThe present view of Chinese martial arts are strongly influenced by the events of the Republican Period . In the transition period between the fall of the Qing Dynasty as well as the turmoils of the Japanese invasion and the Chinese Civil War, Chinese martial arts became more accessible to the general public as many martial artists were encouraged to openly teach their art. At that time, some considered martial arts as a means to promote national pride and build a strong nation. As a result, many martial arts training manuals (拳普) were published, a training academy was created, 2 National examinations were organized as well as demostration teams travelled overseas \nand numerous martial arts associations were formed throughout China and in various oversea Chinese communities. The Central Guoshu Academy (Zhongyang Guoshuguan, 中央國術館/中央国术馆) established by the National Government in 1928 and the Jing Wu Athletic Association (精武體育會/精武体育会) founded by Huo Yuanjia in 1910 are examples of organizations that promoted a systematic approach for training in Chinese martial arts. A series of provincial and national competitions were organized by the Republican government starting in 1932 to promote Chinese martial arts. In 1936, at the 11th Olympic Games in Berlin, a group of Chinese martial artists demonstrated their art to an international audience for the first time.\nEventually, those events lead to the popular view of martial arts as a sport.\n Many well known martial art practitioners chose to escape from the PRC's rule and migrate to Taiwan, Hong Kong, and other parts of the world. Those masters started to teach within the overseas Chinese communities but eventually they expanded their teachings to include people from other cultures.\n encouraged the use of the term \"Kuoshu\" (or Guoshu meaning \"the arts of the nation\"), rather than the colloquial term gongfu, in an effort to more closely associate Chinese martial arts with national pride rather than individual accomplishment. In 1958, the government established the All-China Wushu Association as an umbrella organization to regulate martial arts training. The Chinese State Commission for Physical Culture and Sports took the lead in creating standardized forms for most of the major arts. During this period, a national Wushu system that included standard forms, teaching curriculum, and instructor grading was established. Wushu was introduced at both the high school and university level. The suppression of traditional teaching was relaxed during the Era of Reconstruction , as Communist ideology became more accommodating to alternative viewpoints. In 1979, the State Commission for Physical Culture and Sports created a special task force to reevaluate the teaching and practice of Wushu. In 1986, the Chinese National Research Institute of Wushu was established as the central authority for the research and administration of Wushu activities in the People's Republic of China.  Changing government policies and attitudes towards sports in general lead to the closing of the State Sports Commission (the central sports authority) in 1998. This closure is viewed as an attempt to partially de-politicize organized sports and move Chinese sport policies towards a more market-driven approach. As a result of these changing sociological factors within China, both traditional styles and modern Wushu approaches are being promoted by the Chinese government.\n\n【3】 # Styles\n common themes to the different styles, which are often classified by \"families\" (家, jiā), \"sects\" (派, pai) or \"schools\" (門, men) of martial art styles. There are styles that mimic movements from animals and others that gather inspiration from various Chinese philosophies, myths and legends. Some styles put most of their focus into the harnessing of qi energy, while others concentrate solely on competition and exhibition. Each style offers a different approach to the common problems of self-defense, health and self-cultivation.\n be divided according to religion, imitative-styles (象形拳), and more. There are distinctive differences in the training between different groups of Chinese martial arts regardless of the type of classification.\n\n【4】 # Training\n provide insight into Chinese attitudes and culture.\n\n【5】 ## Basics\nBasics (基本功) are a vital part of the training, as a student cannot progress to the more advanced stages without them; without strong and flexible muscles including the management of the concept of \"Chi\" (breath, or energy) and proper body mechanics, many movements of Chinese martial arts are simply impossible to perform correctly  . Basics training may involve a series of simple movements that are performed repeatedly over a short interval; examples of basics training include stretching, stance work, rudimentary conditioning, meditation and basic kicking and punching techniques.\nA common saying concerning basic training in Chinese martial arts is as follows :\nWhich can be translated as\nTrain both Internal and External.External training includes the hands, the eyes, the body and stances.Internal training includes the heart, the mind, the spirit, breathing and strength.\n\n【6】 ### Stances\nStances (steps or 步法) are structural postures employed in Chinese martial arts training . They represent the foundation and exaggerated form of a fighter's base. Each style has different names and variations for each stance. Stances may be differentiated by foot position, weight distribution, body alignment, etc. Stance training can be practiced statically, the goal of which is to maintain the structure of the stance through a set time period, or dynamically, in which case a series of movements is performed repeatedly. The horse riding stance (骑马步，马步 qí mǎ bù,mǎ bù)and the bow stance are examples of a stances found in many styles of Chinese martial arts.\n\n【7】 ### Meditation\nIn many Chinese Martial Art systems, meditation is considered to be an important component of basic training. Meditation can be used to develop focus, mental clarity and can act as a basis for qigong training.  \n\n【8】 ## Forms\nForms or taolu (Template:Zh-cp) in Chinese are series of predetermined movements combined so they can be practiced as one linear set of movements. Forms were originally intended to preserve the lineage of a particular style branch, and were often taught to advanced students who were selected to preserve the art's lineage. Forms were designed to contain both literal, representative and exercise-oriented forms of applicable techniques which would be extracted, tested and trained by students through sparring sessions.\nMany believe that Kung Fu form needs to be both practical, usable, and applicable as well as promoting flow, meditation, flexibility, balance and coordination. Often kung fu teachers are heard to say \"train your form as if you were sparring and spar as if it were a form.\"\n\n【9】 ### Types of Forms\n \"sparring\" forms, which are choreographed fighting sets performed by two or more people. Sparring forms were designed both to acquaint beginning fighters with basic measures and concepts of combat, and to serve as performance pieces for the school. Sparring forms which utilize weapons are especially useful for teaching students the extension, range and technique required to manage a weapon.\n styles which focus on a certain type of weapon.\n\n【10】 ### Controversy of Modern Form Work\nEven though forms in Chinese martial arts are intended to depict realistic martial techniques, the movements are not always identical to how techniques would be applied in combat. Many forms have been elaborated upon, on the one hand to provide better combat preparedness, and on the other hand to look more aesthetically pleasing. One manifestation of this tendency toward elaboration which goes beyond combat application is the use of lower stances and higher, stretching kicks. These two maneuvers are unrealistic in combat and are utilized in forms for exercise purposes. Many modern schools have replaced practical defense or offense movements with acrobatic feats that are more spectacular to watch, thereby gaining favor during exhibitions and competitions.  This has lead to criticisms by traditionalists for endorsing the more acrobatic, show-oriented Wushu competition.\nAppearance has always been important in many traditional forms as well; forms were often performed for entertainment purposes long before the advent of modern Wushu. Throughout the history of Chinese Martial Arts, practitioners have looked for supplementary income by performing on the streets or in theaters.\nMany traditional Chinese Martial Artists, as well as practitioners of modern sport combat, have become critical of the perception that forms work is more relevant to the art than sparring and drill application.\nAnother reason why the martial techniques often appear different in forms when contrasted with sparring application is thought by some to come from the concealment of the actual functions of the techniques from outsiders, namely rival schools or the authorities, since China has been ruled by foreign powers in the past.\n\n【11】 ### Modern Forms: Wushu\nAs forms have grown in complexity and quantity over the years, and many forms alone could be practiced for a lifetime, styles of modern Chinese martial arts have developed that concentrate solely on forms, and do not practice application at all. These styles are primarily aimed at exhibition and competition, and often include more acrobatic jumps and movements added for enhanced visual effect  compared to the traditional styles. Those who generally prefer to practice traditional styles, focused less on exhibition, are often referred to as traditionalists. Many traditionalists consider the evolution of today's Chinese martial arts as undesirable, saying that much of its original value is lost.\n\n【12】 ## Application\nApplication training refers to the training of putting the martial techniques to use. Chinese martial arts usually contain a large arsenal of techniques and make use of the whole body; efficiency and effectiveness is what the techniques are based on\n  . When and how applications are taught varies from style to style; in the early stages of a student's training, most styles focus on drills in which each student knows what range of combat is being practiced and what attack to expect. Gradually, fewer and fewer rules are applied, and the students learn how to react and utilize technique. 'Sparring' refers to the major aspect of application training, which simulates a combat situation but usually includes rules and regulations to reduce the chance of serious injury to the students.\nThe subject of application training is a controversial one, and is the subject of a raging debate between the Neo-Traditional Martial Artists and Sports and traditional martial artists. In the neo-traditionalist view, martial arts training should eventually lead to and be proven by actual combat as well as being governed by a moral philosophy; neo-traditionalists often believe sparring to test techniques is either irrelevant because of their disbelief in the validity of a regulated test setting, or because the system's techniques are supposedly too dangerous to use outside of a real combat situation. In contrast, the sport-competition and traditionalist view suggests that all of the techniques in Chinese Martial Arts should be repeatedly time-tested through sparring to insure their effectiveness.\nAn example of this approach in the Chinese Martial Arts is the tradition of Lei tai (擂臺/擂台, raised platform fighting) and Sanda (散打) or sǎnshǒu (散手). Lèitái represents public challenge matches that first appeared in the Song Dynasty. The objective for those contests was to knock the opponent from a raised platform by any means necessary.\nSan Shou and Sanda represents the modern development of Lei Tai contests, but with rules in place to reduce the chance of serious injury. Many Chinese martial arts schools teach or work within the rulesets of San Shou and Sanda, working to incorporate the movements, characteristics, and theory of their style. \n\n【13】 ## Weapons training\n make use of training the broad arsenal of Chinese weapons for conditioning the body as well as coordination and strategy drills\n. Weapons training (qìxiè 器械) are generally carried out after the student is proficient in the basics, forms and applications training. The basic theory for weapons training is to consider the weapon as an extension of your body. The same requirements for footwork and body coordination is required . The process of weapon training proceed with forms, forms with partners and then applications. Most systems have training methods for each of the Eighteen Arms of Wushu (shíbābānbīngqì 十八般兵器) in addition to specialized instruments specific to the system.\n\n【14】 # Martial arts and morality\nTraditional Chinese schools of martial arts, such as the famed Shaolin monks, often dealt with the study of martial arts not just as a means of self-defense or mental training, but as a system of ethics  . Wude (武 德) can be translated as \"martial morality\" and is constructed from two Chinese characters, \"wu\" (武) which means martial and \"de\" (德) which means morality. Wude (武德) deals with two aspects; \"morality of deed\" and \"morality of mind\". Morality of deed concerns social relations; morality of mind is meant to cultivate the inner harmony between the emotional mind (Xin, 心) and the wisdom mind (Hui, 慧). The ultimate goal is reaching no extremity (Wuji, 無 極) (closely related to the Taoist concept of wu wei), where both wisdom & emotions are in harmony with each other.\n- Morality of deed\nHumility (Qian Xu; 謙虛/谦虚 qiānxū)\nLoyalty (Zhong Cheng; 忠誠/忠诚 zhōngchéng)\nRespect (Zun Jing; 尊敬 zūnjìng)\nRighteousness (Zheng Yi; 正義/正义 zhèngyì)\nTrust (Xin Yong; 信賴/信赖 xìnlài)\n- Humility (Qian Xu; 謙虛/谦虚 qiānxū)\n- Loyalty (Zhong Cheng; 忠誠/忠诚 zhōngchéng)\n- Respect (Zun Jing; 尊敬 zūnjìng)\n- Righteousness (Zheng Yi; 正義/正义 zhèngyì)\n- Trust (Xin Yong; 信賴/信赖 xìnlài)\n- Morality of mind\nCourage (Yong Gan; 勇氣/勇气 yǒngqì)\nEndurance (Ren Nai; 忍耐 rěnnài)\nPatience (Heng Xin; 性心 xìngxīn)\nPerseverance (Yi Li; 毅力 yìlì)\nWill (Yi Zhi; 意志 yìzhì)\n- Courage (Yong Gan; 勇氣/勇气 yǒngqì)\n- Endurance (Ren Nai; 忍耐 rěnnài)\n- Patience (Heng Xin; 性心 xìngxīn)\n- Perseverance (Yi Li; 毅力 yìlì)\n- Will (Yi Zhi; 意志 yìzhì)\n\n【15】 # Use of qi\nThe concept of qì or ch'i (氣/气), the inner energy or \"life force\" that is said to animate living beings, is encountered in almost all styles of Chinese martial art.  Internal styles are reputed to cultivate its use differently than external styles.\nOne's qi can be improved and strengthened through the regular practice of various physical and mental exercises known as qigong. Though qigong is not a martial art itself, it is often incorporated in Chinese martial arts and, thus, practiced as an integral part to strengthen one's internal abilities.\nThere are many ideas regarding controlling one's qi energy to such an extent that it can be used for healing oneself or others: the goal of medical qigong. Some styles believe in focusing qi into a single point when attacking and aim at specific areas of the human body. Such techniques are known as Dim mak and have principles that are similar to acupressure. \nSome suggest that by practicising qigong to an advanced level it is possible to cause a physical reaction to an opponent without even touching the opponent.  This is a popular concept in Chinese martial arts movies but is rarely seen in the everyday world.\n\n【16】 # Nopractitioners\nExamples of well-known practitioners (武术名师) throughout history:\n- Yue Fei (1103-42 CE) - was a famous Chinese general and patriot of the Song Dynasty. Martial arts styles such as Eagle Claw and Xingyi attribute their creation to Yue. However, there is no historical evidence to support the claim he created these styles.\n- Ng Mui (late 1600s) - was the legendary female founder of many Southern martial arts such as Wing Chun Kuen, Dragon style and Fujian White Crane. She is often considered one of the legendary Five Elders who survived the destruction of the Shaolin Temple during the Qing Dynasty.\n- Yang Luchan  - was an important teacher of the soft style martial art known as tai chi chuan in Beijing during the second half of the 19th century. Yang is known as the founder of Yang style tai chi chuan, as well as transmitting the art to the Wu/Hao, Wu and Sun tai chi families.\n- Ten Tigers of Canton (late 1800s) - was a group of ten of the top Chinese martial arts masters in Guangdong (Canton) towards the end of the Qing Dynasty (1644 – . Wong Kei-Ying, Wong Fei Hung's father, was a member of this group.\n- Wong Fei Hung  - was considered a Chinese folk hero during the Republican period. More than one hundred Hong Kong movies were made about his life. Sammo Hung, Jackie Chan, and Jet Li have all portrayed his character in blockbuster pictures.\n- Huo Yuanjia  - was the founder of Chin Woo Athletic Association who was known for his highly publicized matches with foreigners. His biography was recently portrayed in the movie Fearless .\n- Yip Man  - was a master of the Southern martial art of Wing Chun and the first to teach this style openly. Yip Man was the teacher of Bruce Lee. Most major branches of Wing Chun that exist today were developed and promoted by students of Yip Man.\n- Bruce Lee (1940 -  - was a Chinese American martial artist and actor who was considered an important icon in the 20th century.  He practiced the Southern martial art of Wing Chun and made it famous. Using Wing Chun as his base, he later developed his own martial arts methodology under the name Jeet Kune Do.\n- Jackie Chan (B.  - is a Hong Kong martial artist and actor widely known for injecting physical comedy into his martial arts performances, and for performing complex stunts in many of his films.\n- Jet Li (B.  - is the five-time sport wushu champion of China, later demonstrating his skills in cinema.\n\n【17】 # Popular culture\n\n【18】 Martial arts plays a prominent role in the literature genre known as wuxia(武侠小说). This type of fiction is based on a Chinese concepts of chivalry, a separate martial arts society (Wulin, 武林) and a central theme involving martial arts. Wuxia stories can be traced as far back as 2nd and 3rd century BC, becoming popular by the Tang Dynasty and evolving into novel form by the Ming Dynasty. This genre is still extremely popular throughout East Asia and provides a major influence for the public perception of the martial arts.\n be found in Chinese opera of which Beijing opera is one of the best-known examples\n served to popularize the Chinese martial arts on television. With 60 episodes over a three-year span, it was one of the first North American TV shows that tried to convey the philosophy and practice of Chinese martial arts. \n wuxia, Hong Kong action cinema).\nThe use of Chinese martial arts techniques can now be found in most TV action series, although the philosophy of Chinese martial arts are seldom portrayed in depth.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

MCTD is a systemic autoimmune disease that is characterized by overlapping symptoms of two or more systemic autoimmune diseases (SLE, RA, DM, polymyositis, and scleroderma) and the presence of antibodies against U1snRNP. Primary pathogenesis in MCTD include vasculopathy leading to tissue ischemia, immunological and inflammatory processes and fibrosis caused by excessive synthesis of collagen and other proteins of matrix. In MCTD associated conditions include secondary Sjogren’s syndrome and trigeminal neuralgia. A significant association between U1RNP disease and HLA-DR4 and DR154-61 is detected It is an autoimmune disease and the exact cause is unknown. MCTD has to be differentiated from other conditions with similar presentation of arthritis and rash like systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, undifferentiated connective tissue disease, systemic sclerosis, Sjogren's syndrome, vasculitis, Behcet's syndrome, serum sickness, psoriatic arthritis and human parvovirus B19 infection. The incidence of MCTD is approximately 2.7 per 100,000 individuals per year and the mortality rate is nearly 10.4% over the period of 13-15 years. The female to male ratio is approximately 10 to 1. If the patients with MCTD left untreated, approximately 35% of patients may progress to develop lung fibrosis. Common complications of MCTD include polyarthritis, Raynaud's phenomenon, interstitial lung disease, esophageal dysmotility, sclerodactyly, polymyositis, and pulmonary hypertension. Major causes of morbidity in long-term MCTD patients include sclerodactyly, diffuse sclerosis, pulmonary arterial hypertension, and nervous system disease. Patients with MCTD may have a positive history of Raynaud’s phenomenon, arthralgia, gastroesophageal reflux, myalgia and dyspnea and common symptoms of MCTD include swollen fingers, diffuse swelling of hands, and dry cough. Physical examination is usually include tachycardia, tachypnea, periungual telangiectasia, sclerodactyly, jugular vein distention, rhonchi and wheezing, joint swelling and tenderness, and joints erythema and effusion. Laboratory findings consistent with the diagnosis of MCTD include antibodies against the U1RNP, rheumatoid factor (RF), high CRP levels, hypergammaglobulinemia, anemia, leucopenia, circulating immune complexes, and hypocomplementemia. An x-ray may be helpful in the diagnosis of complications of MCTD, which include features characteristic of polyarthritis and esophageal dilatation. The treatment of patients with MCTD depends on type of internal organ involvement, phase of the disease, and rate of disease progression. Treatment strategies must follow conventional treatments that are used for similar problems in other rheumatic diseases. Usually the treatment of patients with MCTD include low doses of steroids, NSAIDs, immunosuppressive drugs, and biologic agents. The treatment options in refractory cases or in severe clinical conditions include immunoglobulins, cytotoxic agents, and biologic drugs.\n\n【2】 # Historical Perspective\nMCTD was first defined by Gordon C.Sharp et al., in 1972. It has been the first rheumatic disease syndrome defined by a serologic test. In 1976, Alarcon-Segovia proposed criteria for classifying MCTD among all types of connective tissue diseases. It demonstrates the close association between MCTD and Sjogren's syndrome.\n\n【3】 # Classification\nThere is no established system for the classification of mixed connective tissue disease.\n\n【4】 # Pathophysiology\nMCTD is a systemic autoimmune disease that is characterized by overlapping symptoms of two or more systemic autoimmune diseases (SLE, RA, DM, polymyositis, and scleroderma) and the presence of antibodies against U1snRNP. Primary pathogenesis in MCTD include vasculopathy leading to tissue ischemia, immunological and inflammatory processes and fibrosis caused by excessive synthesis of collagen and other proteins of matrix. In MCTD associated conditions include secondary Sjogren’s syndrome and trigeminal neuralgia. A significant association between U1RNP disease and HLA-DR4 and DR154-61 is detected. Gross pathology of skin may include photo-distributed erythematosus annular lesions, papulosquamous lesions, telangiectasia, and sclerodactyly and the skin histopathological findings include poor and lichenoid interface dermatitis and suprabasilar exocytosis around necrotic keratinocytes.\n\n【5】 # Causes\nMixed connective tissue disease is an autoimmune disease and the exact cause is unknown.\n\n【6】 # Differentiating mixed connective tissue disease from Other Diseases\nMCTD has to be differentiated from other conditions with similar presentation of arthritis and rash like systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, rhupus, undifferentiated connective tissue disease, systemic sclerosis, Sjogren's syndrome, vasculitis, Behcet's syndrome, Kikuchi's disease, serum sickness, psoriatic arthritis and human parvovirus B19 infection.\n\n【7】 # Epidemiology and Demographics\nThe incidence of mixed connective tissue disease is approximately 2.7 per 100,000 individuals per year. A nationwide study on MCTD showed the prevalence of mixed connective tissue disease was 2.7 per 100,000 individuals in Japan and 3.8 per 100,000 individuals in Norway. In MCTD, the mortality rate is nearly 10.4% over the period of 13-15 years. It is usually diagnosed during childhood and is more frequent among black and Asian population. The female to male ratio is approximately 10 to 1.\n\n【8】 # Risk Factors\nThere are no established risk factors for mixed connective tissue diease.\n\n【9】 # Screening\nThere is insufficient evidence to recommend routine screening for mixed connective tissue disease.\n\n【10】 # Natural History, Complications, and Prognosis\nIf the patients with mixed connective tissue disease left untreated, approximately 35% of patients may progress to develop lung fibrosis. Common complications of MCTD include polyarthritis, Raynaud's phenomenon, interstitial lung disease, esophageal dysmotility, sclerodactyly, polymyositis, and pulmonary hypertension. Major causes of morbidity in long-term MCTD patients include sclerodactyly, diffuse sclerosis, pulmonary arterial hypertension, and nervous system disease. The presence of pulmonary involvement is associated with worst prognosis and high mortality rate.\n\n【11】 # Diagnosis\n\n【12】 ## Diagnostic Study of Choice\nThe diagnostic criteria of Kasukawa include symptoms common to all the diseases involved, presence of antibodies against the U1snRNP, and selected symptoms typical of each of the particular component diseases separately (systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic sclerosis, polymyositis). The MCTD can be confirmed when there is at least one common symptom, positive antibodies reacting with U1RNP, and at least one symptom from each of the component diseases.\n\n【13】 ## History and Symptoms\nPatients with MCTD may have a positive history of Raynaud’s phenomenon, arthralgia, gastroesophageal reflux, myalgia and dyspnea. Common symptoms of MCTD include swollen fingers (“sausage digits”), diffuse swelling of hands, and dry cough. Less common symptoms include rashes, alopecia, mild fever, fatigue.\n\n【14】 ## Physical Examination\nPhysical examination of patients with MCTD is usually remarkable by clinical features seen in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), dermatomyositis (DM), polymyositis, and scleroderma. Physical examination in patients with MCTD include tachycardia, tachypnea, periungual telangiectasia, sclerodactyly, jugular vein distention, rhonchi and wheezing, joint swelling and tenderness, and joints erythema and effusion.\n\n【15】 ## Laboratory Findings\nLaboratory findings consistent with the diagnosis of MCTD include antibodies against the U1RNP, rheumatoid factor (RF), high CRP levels, hypergammaglobulinemia, anemia, leucopenia, circulating immune complexes, and hypocomplementemia.\n\n【16】 ## Electrocardiogram\nThere are no ECG findings associated with MCTD.\n\n【17】 ## X-ray\nAn x-ray may be helpful in the diagnosis of complications of mixed connective tissue disease, which include features characteristic of polyarthritis (soft tissue atrophy, calcifications, distal interphalangeal joint erosions, juxta-articular osteoporosis, joint space narrowing, marginal erosions, joint deformities without erosions, and osteonecrosis) and interstitial lung disease (ground−glass opacities, peripheral reticular infiltrates, and small irregular opacities).\n\n【18】 ## Echocardiography and Ultrasound\nThere are no ultrasound findings associated with mixed connective tissue disease.\n\n【19】 ## CT scan\nIn MCTD, the tomographic images may show radiographic abnormalities related to interstitial lung disease and the presence of esophageal dilatation. Chest CT scan findings include ground glass opacities, irregularity of the interfaces between the peripheral pleura and aerated lung parenchyma, septal and non-septal lines, intralobular reticular opacities, bronchiolectasis or traction bronchiectasis, areas of cystic spaces (honeycombing), areas of decreased attenuation and air trapping on expiratory computed tomography.\n\n【20】 ## MRI\nMusculoskeletal MRI can identify and characterize subclinical synovial inflammation and joint damage with a greater precision than X-rays. Also cardiac MRI is complementary for diagnosing pulmonary arterial hypertension.\n\n【21】 ## Other Imaging Findings\nThere are no other imaging findings associated with mixed connective tissue disease.\n\n【22】 ## Other Diagnostic Studies\nPulmonary function test may be helpful in the diagnosis of interstitial lung disease as a complication of MCTD. Findings suggestive of interstitial lung disease include significantly lower DLCO values in the active pulmonary stage and restrictive ventilatory defect (reduction of FEV1 and total lung capacity).\n\n【23】 # Treatment\n\n【24】 ## Medical Therapy\nThe treatment of patients with MCTD depends on type of internal organ involvement, phase of the disease, and rate of disease progression. Treatment strategies must follow conventional treatments that are used for similar problems in other rheumatic diseases (SLE, scleroderma, polymyositis). Usually the treatment of patients with MCTD include low doses of steroids, NSAIDs, immunosuppressive drugs, and biologic agents. The treatment options in refractory cases or in severe clinical conditions include immunoglobulins, cytotoxic agents, and biologic drugs.\n\n【25】 ## Surgery\nIn MCTD, surgical options are the alternative for the patients who continue to progress in the disease related complications despite aggressive therapy. The surgical options include procedures like atrial septostomy and lung transplantation.\n\n【26】 ## Primary Prevention\nThere are no established measures for the primary prevention of MCTD.\n\n【27】 ## Secondary Prevention\nIn MCTD effective measures for the secondary prevention of Raynaud's disease include vasodilator therapies (such as calcium channel blockers), preventive approaches like avoidance of cold temperatures, smoking, and sympathomimetic agents and use of warm and protection techniques of fingers.

Children younger than 16 years of age should not normally take isocarboxazid.\nIf your child's doctor has prescribed isocarboxazid for your child, you should watch his or her behavior very carefully, especially at the beginning of treatment and any time his or her dose is increased or decreased. Your child may develop serious symptoms very suddenly, so it is important to pay attention to his or her behavior every day. Call your child's doctor right away if he or she experiences any of these symptoms: new or worsening depression; thinking about harming or killing him- or herself or planning or trying to do so; extreme worry; agitation; panic attacks; difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep; irritability; aggressive behavior; acting without thinking; severe restlessness; frenzied abnormal excitement, or any other sudden or unusual changes in behavior.\n want to speak with you or your child by telephone from time to time. Be sure that your child keeps all appointments for office visits or telephone conversations with his or her doctor.\n can obtain the Medication Guide from the FDA website /cder.\nTalk to your child's doctor about the risks of giving isocarboxazid to your child.\n\n【2】 # Why this medication is prescribed\nIsocarboxazid is used to treat depression in people who have not been helped by other antidepressants. Isocarboxazid is in a class of medications called monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). It works by increasing the amounts of certain natural substances in the brain that help maintain mental balance.\n\n【3】 # How this medication should be used\nIsocarboxazid comes as a t to take by mouth. It is usually taken between two and four times a day. Take isocarboxazid at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take isocarboxazid exactly as directed.\nSwallow the ts with water or another liquid. If you are unable to swallow the ts, you can crumble them and swallow the crumbled ts with food or liquid.\nIsocarboxazid may be habit-forming. Do not take a larger dose, take it more often, or take it for a longer period of time than prescribed by your doctor.\nYour doctor will probably start you on a low dose of isocarboxazid and gradually increase your dose, not more often than once every 2-4 days at first, and then not more often than once every week. After your symptoms improve, your doctor will probably gradually decrease your dose of isocarboxazid.\nIsocarboxazid is used to treat depression but does not cure it. It may take 3-6 weeks or longer before you feel the full benefit of isocarboxazid. Tell your doctor if your symptoms do not improve during the first 6 weeks of your treatment with isocarboxazid. If your symptoms do improve during your treatment, continue to take isocarboxazid. Do not stop taking isocarboxazid without talking to your doctor.\n\n【4】 # Other uses for this medicine\nThis medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\n【5】 # Special precautions\nBefore taking isocarboxazid:\n- tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to isocarboxazid, any other medications, or any of the inactive ingredients in isocarboxazid ts.

Do not drive a car, pilot an airplane, operate machinery, climb ladders, or work in high places until you know how this medication affects you.\n- remember that alcohol can add to the drowsiness caused by this medication. Do not drink alcohol while you are taking isocarboxazid.\n- you should know that isocarboxazid may cause dizziness, lightheadedness, and fainting when you get up too quickly from a lying position. This is more common when you first start taking isocarboxazid. To avoid this problem, get out of bed slowly, resting your feet on the floor for a few minutes before standing up.\n- you should know that your mental health may change in unexpected ways, especially at the beginning of your treatment and any time that your dose is increased or decreased. These changes may occur at any time if you have depression or another mental illness, whether or not you are taking isocarboxazid or any other medication. You, your family, or your caregiver should call your doctor right away if you experience any of the following symptoms: new or worsening depression; thinking about harming or killing yourself or planning or trying to do so; extreme worry; agitation; panic attacks; difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep; aggressive behavior; irritability; acting without thinking; severe restlessness; and frenzied, abnormal excitement. Be sure that your family or caregiver knows which symptoms may be serious so they can call the doctor when you are unable to seek treatment on your own.\n\n【6】 # Special dietary instructions\n avoid foods and drinks that contain caffeine during your treatment with isocarboxazid. Follow these directions carefully. Ask your doctor or dietitian if you have any questions about what you may eat and drink during your treatment.\n\n【7】 # What to do if you forget a dose\nTake the missed dose as soon as you remember it.

Depending on the particle size it is distinguished between crushing (coarse feed material, bigger than appr. 50 to 100 mm) and grinding. Machines used for comminution are jaw crusher, cone and gyratory crushers, roller crusher, impact crusher, tube mills (e.g. ball mills or autogenous mills), vertical roller mills, and roller presses.\n\n【1】 # Mining\nComminution refers to a series of mineral processing techniques used in extractive metallurgy to reduce particle sizes of rocks and ores.

Banishment or exile is a similar process, but is forcibly applied to individuals and groups.\nOften the affected population is transferred by force to a distant region, perhaps not suited to their way of life, causing them substantial harm. In addition, the loss of all immovable property and, when forced, the loss of substantial amounts of movable property, is implied.\nPopulation exchange is the transfer of two populations in opposite directions at about the same time. Such exchanges have taken place several times in the 20th century, such as between post-Ottoman Turkey and Greece, and during the partition of India and Pakistan.\n\n【1】 # Issues arising from population transfer\nAccording to political scientist Norman Finkelstein transfer was considered as an accepsolution to the problems of ethnic conflict, up until around World War II and even a little afterward, in certain cases.  Transfer was considered a drastic but \"often necessary\" means to end an ethnic conflict or ethnic civil war. The feasibility of population transfer was hugely increased by the creation of railroad networks from the mid-19th century.\nPopulation transfer differs more than simply technically from individually-motivated migration, though at times of war, the act of fleeing from danger or famine often blurs the differences. If a state can preserve the fiction that migrations are the result of innumerable \"personal\" decisions, then the state may be able to justify its stand that it has not been culpably involved. Jews who had actually signed over properties in Germany and Austria during Nazism found it nearly impossible to be reimbursed after World War II.\n\n【2】 # Changing status in international law\nThe view of international law on population transfer underwent considerable evolution during the 20th century. Prior to World War II, a number of major population transfers were the result of bilateral treaties and had the support of international bodies such as the League of Nations.  Even the expulsion of Germans from central and eastern Europe after World War II was sanctioned by the Potsdam Agreement.  The tide started to turn when the Charter of the Nuremberg Trials of German Nazi leaders declared forced deportation of civilian populations to be both a war crime and a crime against humanity, and this opinion was progressively adopted and extended through the remainder of the century.  Underlying the change was the trend to assign rights to individuals, thereby limiting the rights of states to make agreements which adversely affect them.\nThere is now little debate about the general legal status of involuntary population transfers: Where population transfers used to be accepted as a means to settle ethnic conflict, today, forced population transfers are considered violations of international law. No legal distinction is made between one-way and two-transfers, since the rights of each individual are regarded as independent of the experience of others.\nAn interim report of the United Nations Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities  says:\nThe same report warned of the difficulty of ensuring true voluntariness: some historical transfers did not call for forced or compulsory transfers, but included options for the affected populations. Nonetheless, the conditions attending the relevant treaties created strong moral, psychological and economic pressures to move.\nThe final report of the Sub-Commission  invoked a large number of legal conventions and treaties to support the position that population transfers contravene international law unless they have the consent of both the moved population and the host population; moreover, that consent must be given free of direct or indirect negative pressure.\n\"Deportation or forcible transfer of population\" is defined as a crime against humanity by the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (Article . The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia has put on trial, and in some cases has convicted, a number of politicians and military commanders indicted for forced deportations in that region.\nGiven the logistics of a forced \"transfer,\" it is widely thought of as a euphemism for ethnic cleansing. In its most idealistic connotation, \"transfer\" is the mildest form of ethnic cleansing — a peaceful relocation of a compliant people from one area to another. Nationalist agitation and its supportive propaganda are typical political tools by which public support is cultivated in favor of population transfer as a solution to conflict.\nTimothy V. Waters argues in \"On the Legal Construction of Ethnic Cleansing\" that the expulsions of the German population east of the Oder-Neisse line the Sudetenland and elsewhere in Eastern Europe without legal redress has set a legal precedent that can permit future ethnic cleansing of other populations under international law.\n\n【3】 # Cases of population transfer\n\n【4】 ## Ancient world\nIn the ancient world, population transfer was the more humane alternative to putting all the males of a conquered territory to death and enslaving the women and children. The Babylonian captivity of the elite of Jerusalem on three occasions in the 6th century BCE was a population transfer.\n\n【5】 ## Tawantinsuyu\nThe Inca were known to have dispersed conquered ethnic groups throughout their empire.  The intent was to break down traditional community ties and force the heterogeneous population to adopt the Kechwa language and culture.  Never fully successful in the pre-Columbian era, these totalitarian policies ironically experienced their greatest success when they were adopted as a pan-Andean identity defined against Spanish rule starting in the 16th century.\n\n【6】 ## Expulsion of Jews and Gypsies\n Jewish refugees, History of anti-Semitism, and  for more details.\nAnother event, in 1609, was the final transfer of 300,000 Muslims out of Spain, after more than a century of Catholic trials, segregation, and religious restrictions. Most of the Spanish Muslims went to North Africa and to areas of Ottoman Empire control.\n\n【7】 ## France\nTwo famous transfers connected with the history of France are the expulsion of the Jews, 1308, and of the Huguenots who were declared illegal by the Edict of Fontainebleau, 1685. In both cases, the population was not forced out but rather their religion was declared illegal.\n\n【8】 ## United States: Native American relocations\nIn the nineteenth century, the United States government removed a number of Native American nations to federally owned and designated Indian reservations. Starting in the 1830s with the Choctaw people, the policy known as Indian Removal relocated many nations living east of the Mississippi River to the Indian Territory in the west, a process that resulted in the \"Trail of Tears\" for the Cherokees. Resistance to Indian Removal led to several violent conflicts, including the Second Seminole War in Florida. Later in the century, the establishment of reservations for the Plains Indians led to numerous Indian Wars.\n\n【9】 ## Ottoman Empire\n\n【10】 ### Population transfers in the classical period, 1300-1600\nThe early Ottoman state utilized forced population transfers as a tool to reorder the ethnic and economic landscape of its territories. The term used in Ottoman documents and modern Turkish is surgun, from the verb surmek, to drive, as in to drive a flock of sheep.\nOttoman population transfers through the reign of Mehmet I (d.  shuttled tribal Turkmen and Tatar groups from the state's Asiatic territories to the Balkans (Rumeli). Many of these groups were supported as paramilitary forces along the frontier with Christian Europe. Simultaneously, Christian communities were transported from newly conquered lands in the Balkans into Thrace and Anatolia. While these general flows back and forth across the Dardanelles continued, the reigns of Murad II (d.  and Mehmet II (d.  focused heavily on the demographic reorganization of the empire's urban centers. Murad II's conquest of Salonika was followed by its state-enforced settlement by Muslims from Yenice Vardar and Anatolia. Mehmet II's transfers focused on the re-population of the city of Istanbul following its conquest in 1453, transporting Christians, Muslims, and Jews into the new capital from across the empire.\nBeginning in the reign of Bayezid II (d. , transfers were used to manage the Ottoman state's difficulty with the heterodox kizilbas movement in eastern Anatolia. Forced relocation of the kizilbas continued until at least the end of the 16th century. Merchants, artisans, and scholars were transported to Istanbul from Tabriz and Cairo under Selim I (d. . The state mandated Muslim immigration to Rhodes and Cyprus following their conquests in 1522 and 1571, respectively, and resettled Greek Cypriots on the Anatolia coast.\nKnowledge of the Ottoman usage of surgun from the 17th through the 19th century is sketchy. It appears that the state did not utilize forced population transfers during this time to the extent that it did during its expansionist period.\n\n【11】 ### Balkan population exchanges, 1913\nAfter the exchanges in the Balkans, forced population transfer was used by the Great Powers and later the League of Nations as a mechanism for increasing homogeneity in post-Ottoman Balkan states. A Norwegian diplomat working with the League of Nations as a High Commissioner for Refugees beginning 1919, proposed the idea of a forced population transfer modeled on the earlier post Balkan-war Greek-Bulgarian mandatory population transfer of Greeks in Bulgaria to Greece, and Bulgarians in Greece to Bulgaria.\n\n【12】 ### Armenian population\nThe event known as the Armenian Genocide involved large scale one way population transfer, thus it must be mentioned here, but it involved and culminated in ethnic cleansing and Genocide. For more information see Armenian Genocide.\nThe Armenian population of the Ottoman Empire was deported and transferred in the years from 1915-1919. It was organised by the Young Turk Ottoman government and officially called tehcir (meaning \"forced relocation\", but it was translated into English as deportation or banishment—effectively what \"tehcir\" was in this context). These deportations led to the death of approximately 1.5 million Armenians, many of whom were deported to the Syrian deserts in inhumane death marches with atrocious conditions. Consequently the Transfer of the Armenian population and associated events are considered Genocide. Thus the \"population transfer\" was not the actual goal of the deportations (this was the elimination of the Armenians), but it was the means of achieving this goal.\n\n【13】 ## Republic of Turkey\nThe League of Nations moving the defined those to be mutually expelled as the \"Muslim inhabitants of Greece\" to Turkey and moving \"the Greek inhabitants of Turkey\" to Greece. The plan met with fierce opposition in both countries and was condemned vigorously by a large number of countries.  Undeterred, Nansen worked with both Greece and Turkey to gain their acceptance of the proposed population exchange. About 1.5 million Greeks and half a million Muslims were moved from one side of the international border to the other.\nPopulation transfer prevented further attacks on minorities in the respective states while Nansen was awarded a Nobel Prize for Peace. As a result of the transfers, the Muslim minority in Greece and the Greek minority in Turkey were much reduced.  Cyprus was not included in the Greco-Turkish population transfer of 1923 because it was under direct British control.\n\n【14】 ## Central Europe\nAfter the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact divided Poland during World War II, Germans deported Poles and Jews from Polish territories annexed by Nazi Germany, while the Soviet Union deported Germans and Poles from areas of Eastern Poland, Kresy.\nFrom 1940 on Hitler tried to get resettle Germans from the areas where they constituted a minority (the Baltics, South-Eastern and Eastern Europe) into the Warthegau - the region around Poznan in present day Poland. For this reason he expelled the Poles and Jews who formed there the majority of the population. Before the war the Germans constituted 16% of the population in the area.\nThe Nazis initially tried to press Jews to emigration. In Austria they succeeded in driving out most of the Jewish population. But increasing foreign resistance brought this plan to a virtual halt. Later on Jews were transferred to ghettoes and eventually to death camps.\nAfter World War II, when the Curzon line was implemented, members of all ethnic groups were transferred to their respective new territories (Poles to Poland, Ukrainians to Ukraine). The same applied to the Oder-Neisse line, where German citizens were transferred to Germany. Germans were expelled from areas annexed by the Soviet Union as well as territories such as the so-called Sudetenland of Czechoslovakia and Hungary.\n\n【15】 ## Soviet Union\n been a factor. After the WWII, the population of East Prussia was replaced by the Soviet one, mainly by Russians.\n\n【16】 ## South East Europe\nIn September 1940 with the return of Southern Dobruja (the Cadrilater) by Romania to Bulgaria under the Treaty of Craiova, 80,000 Romanians were compelled to move north of the border, while 65,000 Bulgarians living in Northern Dobruja moved into Bulgaria.\nDuring the Yugoslav wars of the 1990s, the breakup of Yugoslavia caused large population transfers, mostly involuntary. Because it was a conflict fueled by ethnic nationalism, people of minority ethnicity generally fled towards regions where their ethnicity was in a majority.\nThe phenomenon of \"ethnic cleansing\" was first seen in Croatia but soon spread to Bosnia. Since the Bosnian Muslims had no immediate refuge, they were arguably hardest hit by the ethnic violence. United Nations tried to create safe areas for Muslim populations of eastern Bosnia but in cases such as the Srebrenica massacre, the peacekeeping troops failed to protect the safe areas resulting in the massacre of thousands of Muslims.\nThe Dayton Accords ended the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, fixating the borders between the two warring parties roughly to the ones established by the autumn of 1995. One immediate result of the population transfer following the peace deal was a sharp decline in ethnic violence in the region.\n Washington Post Balkan Report for a summary of the conflict, and FAS analysis of former Yugoslavia for population ethnic distribution maps.\nA massive and systematic deportation of Serbia's Albanians took place during the Kosovo War of 1999, with around 800,000 Albanians (out of a population of about 1.5 million) forced to flee Kosovo.  This was quickly reversed at the war's end, but thousands of Serbs were in turn forced to flee into Serbia proper.\nA number of commanders and politicians, notably Serbia and Yugoslavia's former president Slobodan Milošević, were put on trial by the United Nations' International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia for a variety of war crimes, including deportations and genocide.\n\n【17】 ## Caucasia\nIn the Caucasian region of the former Soviet Union the phenomenon of population transfer along ethnic lines has affected many thousands of individuals in Armenia, Nagorno-Karabakh and Azerbaijan proper; from Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Georgia proper; as well as from Chechnya and adjacent areas within Russia.\n\n【18】 ## South Asia\nWhen British India became independent after the Second World War its Muslim inhabitants formed their own state consisting of two non-contiguous territorial entities: East and West Pakistan. In order to facilitate the creation of new states along religious lines (as opposed to racial or linguistic lines) population exchanges between India and Pakistan were implemented, at the expense of significant human suffering in the process. More than 5 million Hindus moved from present-day Pakistan into present-day India, and more than 6 million Muslims moved in the other direction.  A large number of people (more than a million by some estimates) died in the accompanying violence.\nOn the Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia between 1967 and 1973 the British Government forcibly removed 2000 Chagossian islanders to make way for a military base. Despite court judgments in their favour, they have not been allowed to return from their exile in Mauritius, although there are signs that financial compensation along with an official apology is being considered by the British government.\n\n【19】 ## Middle East\nAs the focus of all three of the major Abrahamic religions — Judaism, Christianity, and Islam — which have frequently been mutually antagonistic, the Middle East has suffered periodic population transfers motivated by religious beliefs.\nKuwait expelled 500,000 Palestinian Arabs during the Gulf War because of their support for Saddam Hussein's invasion.\n\n【20】 ### Israel/Palestine\nAlthough not part of an officially orchestrated population transfer, a parallel of population movements in opposite directions occurred at the time of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War and during the following years. The majority of the Arab population of the area of what is now the State of Israel fled or was forced to leave in 1948-50. After the war, there was a large influx of Jewish refugees as well as a smaller number of voluntary Zionist immigrants into the newly established state. The Palestinian exodus of between 420,000 and 910,000 during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, was subsequently followed by the Jewish exodus from Arab lands numbering between 758,000 and 866,000. While two thirds of these \"Arab Jewish\" refugees settled in Israel, the bulk of the Palestinian Arab refugees from the former British Mandate of Palestine ended up in the Gaza strip, Cisjordan, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon. The cause of these population movements is hotly debated.\nAlthough an actual population transfer between the Jews and the Arabs only took place around the period of the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, the idea of the transfer of Arabs from Palestine, usually to Iraq, had been on both the Zionist and non-Jewish agenda for about half a century beforehand.\nZionist leaders such as Theodor Herzl, David Ben-Gurion, Chaim Weizmann and many others would repeatedly put forward such transfer proposals, and they were often of a compulsory nature. The American Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Herbert Hoover likewise made such proposals. Even Arab leaders and pro-Arab personalities came out in favour of such a transfer. One of the recommendations in the Report of the British Peel Commission in 1937 was for a transfer of Arabs from the area of the proposed Jewish state, and this even included a compulsory transfer from the Plains of Palestine. This recommendation was initially not objected to  by the British Government.\nDuring August 2005, Israel unilaterally evacuated all its settlers  from the Gaza Strip and northern West Bank, areas occupied by Israel, as part of the disengagement plan.\n\n【21】 # Other kinds of transfer\nA penal colony such as Georgia, Botany Bay or Devil's Island is a case-by-case transfer that may finally add up to a sizable population, but does not come under this heading. The movement of military POWs can be a case of transfer in cases where the numbers are large.

As stated in the Economist, it \"seeks to make exchange-rate theory a bit more digestible\".\n\n【1】 # Overview\n gave rise to the word burgernomics.\nOne suggested method of predicting exchange rate movements is that the rate between two currencies should naturally adjust so that a sample basket of goods and services should cost the same in both currencies.  In the Big Mac Index, the \"basket\" in question is considered to be a single Big Mac sandwich as sold by the McDonald's fast food restaurant chain.  The Big Mac was chosen because it is available to a common specification in many countries around the world, with local McDonald's franchisees having significant responsibility for negotiating input prices.  For these reasons, the index enables a comparison between many countries' currencies. Some menu items are market specific, which would hinder a comparison, if used.  Still other menu items are specially priced, such as the dollar menu in many U.S. restaurants consisting of sandwiches and other items that cost $1.\nThe Big Mac PPP exchange rate between two countries is obtained by dividing the price of a Big Mac in one country (in its currency) by the price of a Big Mac in another country (in its currency).  This value is then compared with the actual exchange rate; if it is lower, then the first currency is under-valued (according to PPP theory) compared with the second, and conversely, if it is higher, then the first currency is over-valued.\nFor example, suppose the price of a Big Mac is $2.50 in the United States and £2.00 in the United Kingdom; thus, the PPP rate is 2.50/2.00 = 1.25. If, in fact, the US dollar buys £0.50 (or £1 = $2., then it is under-valued (1.25 < 2. with the respect to the pound by 38% in comparison with the price of the Big Mac in both countries (information as of .\nThe Economist sometimes produces variants on the theme.  For example in January 2004, it showed a Tall Latte index with the Big Mac replaced by a cup of Starbucks coffee.  In a similar vein, in 1997, the newspaper drew up a \"Coca-Cola map\" that showed inverse proportionality between the amount of Cola consumed per capital in a country and that country's health.\nThe burger methodology has limitations in its estimates of the PPP. In many countries, eating at international fast-food chain restaurants such as McDonald's is relatively expensive in comparison to eating at a local restaurant, and the demand for Big Macs is not as large in countries like India as in the United States. Social status of eating at fast food restaurants like McDonald's, local taxes, levels of competition, and import duties on selected items may not be representative of the country's economy as a whole.  In addition, there is no theoretical reason why non-tradable goods and services such as property costs should be equal in different countries: this is the theoretical reason for PPPs being different from market exchange rates over time.  Nevertheless, the Big Mac Index has become widely cited by economists.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Common adverse reactions include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache dizziness, confusion, hallucinations, blurred vision, and tinnitus.\n\n【3】 # Adult Indications and Dosage\n\n【4】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Adult)\n- AMICAR is useful in enhancing hemostasis when fibrinolysis contributes to bleeding. In life-threatening situations, transfusion of appropriate blood products and other emergency measures may be required.\n- Fibrinolytic bleeding may frequently be associated with surgical complications following heart surgery (with or without cardiac bypass procedures) and portacaval shunt; hematological disorders such as amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia (accompanying aplastic anemia); acute and life-threatening abruptio placentae; hepatic cirrhosis; and neoplastic disease such as carcinoma of the prostate, lung, stomach, and cervix.\n- Urinary fibrinolysis, usualIy a normal physiological phenomenon, may contribute to excessive urinary tract fibrinolytic bleeding associated with surgical hematuria (following prostatectomy and nephrectomy) or nonsurgical hematuria (accompanying polycystic or neoplastic diseases of the genitourinary system)\n- An identical dosage regimen may be followed by administering aminocaproic acid ts or AMICAR oral solution as follows:\n- For the treatment of acute bleeding syndromes due to elevated fibrinolytic activity, it is suggested that 5 aminocaproic acid 1000 mg ts or 10 aminocaproic acid 500 mg ts (5 g) or 20 milliliter of aminocaproic acid oral solution (5 g) be administered during the first hour of treatment, followed by a continuing rate of 1 aminocaproic acid 1000 mg t or 2 aminocaproic acid 500 mg ts (1 g) or 5 milliliter of aminocaproic acid oral solution (1.25 g) per hour. This method of treatment would ordinarily be continued for about 8 hours or until the bleeding situation has been controlled.\n\n【5】 ## Off-Label Use and Dosage (Adult)\n\n【6】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Aminocaproic acid (oral) in adult patients.\n\n【7】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Aminocaproic acid (oral) in adult patients.\n\n【8】 # Pediatric Indications and Dosage\n\n【9】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Pediatric)\nThere is limited information regarding FDA-Labeled Use of Aminocaproic acid (oral) in pediatric patients.\n\n【10】 ## Off-Label Use and Dosage (Pediatric)\n\n【11】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Aminocaproic acid (oral) in pediatric patients.\n\n【12】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Aminocaproic acid (oral) in pediatric patients.\n\n【13】 # Contraindications\n- Aminocaproic acid should not be used when there is evidence of an active intravascular clotting process.\n- When there is uncertainty as to whether the cause of bleeding is primary fibrinolysis or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), this distinction must be made before administering aminocaproic acid.\n- The following tests can be applied to differentiate the two conditions:\n- Platelet count is usually decreased in DIC but normal in primary fibrinolysis.\n- Protamine paracoagulation test is positive in DIC; a precipitate forms when protamine sulfate is dropped into citrated plasma. The test is negative in the presence of primary fibrinolysis.\n- The euglobulin clot Iysis test is abnormal in primary fibrinolysis but normal in DIC.\n- Aminocaproic acid must not be used in the presence of DIC without concomitant heparin.\n\n【14】 # Warnings\n- In patients with upper urinary tract bleeding, aminocaproic acid administration has been known to cause intrarenal obstruction in the form of glomerular capillary thrombosis or clots in the renal pelvis and ureters. For this reason, aminocaproic acid should not be used in hematuria of upper urinary tract origin, unless the possible benefits outweigh the risk.\n- Subendocardial hemorrhages have been observed in dogs given intravenous infusions of 0.2 times the maximum human therapeutic dose of aminocaproic acid and in monkeys given 8 times the maximum human therapeutic dose of aminocaproic acid.\n- Fatty degeneration of the myocardium has been reported in dogs given intravenous doses of aminocaproic acid at 0.8 to 3.3 times the maximum human therapeutic dose and in monkeys given intravenous doses of aminocaproic acid at 6 times the maximum human therapeutic dose.\n- Rarely, skeletal muscle weakness with necrosis of muscle fibers has been reported following prolonged administration. Clinical presentation may range from mild myalgias with weakness and fatigue to a severe proximal myopathy with rhabdomyolysis, myoglobinuria, and acute renal failure. Muscle enzymes, especially creatine phosphokinase (CPK) are elevated. CPK levels should be monitored in patients on long-term therapy. Aminocaproic acid administration should be stopped if a rise in CPK is noted. Resolution follows discontinuation of aminocaproic acid; however, the syndrome may recur if aminocaproic acid is restarted.\n be considered when skeletal myopathy occurs. One case of cardiac and hepatic lesions observed in man has been reported. The patient received 2 g of aminocaproic acid every 6 hours for a total dose of 26 g.

There have been some reports of dry ejaculation during the period of aminocaproic acid treatment. These have been reported to date only in hemophilia patients who received the drug after undergoing dental surgical procedures. However, this symptom resolved in all patients within 24 to 48 hours of completion of therapy.\n\n【18】 # Drug Interactions\nThere is limited information regarding Aminocaproic acid (oral) Drug Interactions in the drug label.\n\n【19】 # Use in Specific Populations\n\n【20】 ### Pregnancy\nPregnancy Category (FDA): C\n not known whether aminocaproic acid can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. aminocaproic acid should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.\nPregnancy Category (AUS):\n- Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) Pregnancy Category\nThere is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Aminocaproic acid (oral) in women who are pregnant.\n\n【21】 ### Labor and Delivery\nThere is no FDA guidance on use of Aminocaproic acid (oral) during labor and delivery.\n\n【22】 ### Nursing Mothers\n- It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when aminocaproic acid is administered to a nursing woman.\n\n【23】 ### Pediatric Use\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Aminocaproic acid (oral) with respect to pediatric patients.\n\n【24】 ### Geriatic Use\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Aminocaproic acid (oral) with respect to geriatric patients.\n\n【25】 ### Gender\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Aminocaproic acid (oral) with respect to specific gender populations.\n\n【26】 ### Race\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Aminocaproic acid (oral) with respect to specific racial populations.\n\n【27】 ### Renal Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Aminocaproic acid (oral) in patients with renal impairment.\n\n【28】 ### Hepatic Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Aminocaproic acid (oral) in patients with hepatic impairment.\n\n【29】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Aminocaproic acid (oral) in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n\n【30】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\nThere is no FDA guidance one the use of Aminocaproic acid (oral) in patients who are immunocompromised.\n\n【31】 # Administration and Monitoring\n\n【32】 ### Administration\n- Oral\n\n【33】 ### Monitoring\n- Muscle enzymes, especially creatine phosphokinase (CPK) are elevated. CPK levels should be monitored in patients on long-term therapy.\n\n【34】 # IV Compatibility\nThere is limited information regarding IV Compatibility of Aminocaproic acid (oral) in the drug label.\n\n【35】 # Overdosage\n- A few cases of acute overdosage with aminocaproic acid administered intravenously have been reported. The effects have ranged from no reaction to transient hypotension to severe acute renal failure leading to death. One patient with a history of brain tumor and seizures experienced seizures after receiving an 8 gram bolus injection of aminocaproic acid.\n- The single dose of aminocaproic acid causing symptoms of overdosage or considered to be life-threatening is unknown. Patients have tolerated doses as high as 100 grams while acute renal failure has been reported following a dose of 12 grams.\n- The intravenous and oral LD50 of aminocaproic acid were 3.0 and 12.0 g/kg, respectively, in the mouse and 3.2 and 16.4 g/kg, respectively, in the rat. An intravenous infusion dose of 2.3 g/kg was lethal in the dog. On intravenous administration, tonic-clonic convulsions were observed in dogs and mice.\n- No treatment for overdosage is known, although evidence exists that aminocaproic acid is removed by hemodialysis and may be removed by peritoneal dialysis. Pharmacokinetic studies have shown that total body clearance of aminocaproic acid is markedly decreased in patients with severe renal failure.\n\n【36】 # Pharmacology\n\n【37】 ## Mechanism of Action\n\n【38】 ## Structure\n- Aminocaproic acid is soluble in water, acid, and alkaline solutions; it is sparingly soluble in methanol and practically insoluble in chloroform.\n- aminocaproic acid oral solution for oral administration, contains 0.25 g/mL of aminocaproic acid with methylparaben 0.20%, propylparaben 0.05%, edetate disodium 0.30% as preservatives and the following inactive ingredients: sodium saccharin, sorbitol solution, citric acid anhydrous, natural and artificial raspberry flavor and an artificial bitterness modifier.\n- Each aminocaproic acid (aminocaproic acid) t, for oral administration contains 500 mg or 1000 mg of aminocaproic acid and the following inactive ingredients: povidone, crospovidone, stearic acid, and magnesium stearate.\n\n【39】 ## Pharmacodynamics\nThere is limited information regarding Pharmacodynamics of Aminocaproic acid (oral) in the drug label.\n\n【40】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n- The fibrinolysis-inhibitory effects of aminocaproic acid appear to be exerted principally via inhibition of plasminogen activators and to a lesser degree through antiplasmin activity.\n- In adults, oral absorption appears to be a zero-order process with an absorption rate of 5.2 g/hr. The mean lag time in absorption is 10 minutes. After a single oral dose of 5 g, absorption was complete (F=. Mean ± SD peak plasma concentrations (164 ± 28 mcg/mL) were reached within 1.2 ± 0.45 hours.\n- After oral administration, the apparent volume of distribution was estimated to be 23.1 ± 6.6 L (mean ± SD). Correspondingly, the volume of distribution after intravenous administration has been reported to be 30.0 ± 8.2 L. After prolonged administration, aminocaproic acid has been found to distribute throughout extravascular and intravascular compartments of the body, penetrating human red blood cells as well as other tissue cells.\n- Renal excretion is the primary route of elimination. Sixty-five percent of the dose is recovered in the urine as unchanged drug and 11% of the dose appears as the metabolite adipic acid. Renal clearance (116 mL/min) approximates endogenous creatinine clearance. The total body clearance is 169 mL/min. The terminal elimination half-life for aminocaproic acid is approximately 2 hours.\n\n【41】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\nThere is limited information regarding Nonclinical Toxicology of Aminocaproic acid (oral) in the drug label.\n\n【42】 # Clinical Studies\nThere is limited information regarding Clinical Studies of Aminocaproic acid (oral) in the drug label.\n\n【43】 # How Supplied\n- Aminocaproic acid oral solution, 0.25 g/mL\n- Each mL of raspberry-flavored oral solution contains 0.25 g/mL of aminocaproic acid.\n- 16 Fl.

{"seq_id": "4c972070-b6e9-47f5-8f6a-bccc5c9be088", "title": null, "text": "【0】 Polycephaly\n been used for other meanings of \"head\".  The term is derived from the stems poly- meaning 'many' and kephal- meaning \"head\", and encompasses bicephaly and dicephaly (both referring to two-headedness).  A variation is an animal born with two faces on a single head, a condition known as diprosopus.  In medical terms these are all congenital cephalic disorders.\nThere are many occurrences of multi-headed animals, in real life as well as in mythology.  In heraldry and vexillology, the double-headed eagle is a common symbol, though no such animal is known to have ever existed.\nBicephalic or tricephalic animals are the only type of multi-headed creatures seen in the real world and form by the same process as conjoined twins: the zygote begins to split but fails to completely separate.  One extreme example of this is the condition of craniopagus parasiticus, whereby a fully developed body has a parasitic twin head joined at the skull.\n\n【1】 # Occurrences\nTwo-headed people and animals, though rare, have long been known to exist and documented.  The \"Scottish brothers\" were conjoined twins, allegedly dicephalic, born 1460 (dates vary).  (Human conjoined twins, not all of the dicephalic type, have been documented since the year 945.)\n\n【2】 ## Novelty and study\nPolycephalic animals often make local news headlines when found.  The most commonly observed two-headed animals are tortoises and snakes.  Other species with known two-headed occurrences include cattle, sheep, pigs, cats, dogs, and fish.  In 1894, a two-headed partridge was reported in Boston, Massachusetts. It was noas a dicephalic animal for surviving into adulthood with two perfect heads.  Scientists have published in modern journals about dissecting such animals since at least the 1930s.  A 1929 paper studied the anatomy of a two-headed kitten.\nPolycephalic animals, due to their rarity, are a subject of novelty.  \"We\", a two-headed albino rat snake born in captivity in 2000, was scheduled to be auctioned on eBay with an expected price tag of $150,000 (£87,, though their policy of not trading in live animals prevented the sale. On 2006-10-31, the World Aquarium announced that \"We\" was adopted by Nutra Pharma Corporation, a biotechnology company developing treatments using modified cobra venom and cobratoxin. \"We\" died of natural causes at age eight in June 2007.\nTwo-headed farm animals sometimes travel with animal side shows to county fairs.  Many museums of natural history contain preserved two-headed animals.  The Museum of Lausanne in Lausanne, Switzerland, and the Ripley's Believe It Or Not! museum in Gatlinburg, Tennessee, have collections of preserved two-headed animals.\n\n【3】 ## Anatomy and fitness\nEach head of a polycephalic animal has its own brain, and they somehow share control of the organs and limbs, though the specific structure of the connections varies.  Animals often move in a disoriented and dizzy fashion, with the brains \"arguing\" with each other; some animals simply zig-zag without getting anywhere  Snake heads may attack and even attempt to swallow each other.  Thus, polycephalic animals survive poorly in the wild compared to normal monocephalic animals.\nMost two-headed snakes only live for a few months, though some have been reported to live a full life and even reproduced with the offspring born normal.   A two-headed black rat snake with separate throats and stomachs survived for 20 years.  \"We\", the two-headed albino rat snake, survived in captivity for 8 years before passing away.   There is some speculation that the inbreeding of snakes in captivity increases the chances of a two-headed birth.\nA famous successful modern case is that of the human dicephalic twins Abigail and Brittany Hensel, born in 1990.  The twins have two heads, two hearts, four lungs, and two spinal cords, and share the other organs.  Each twin controls the limbs on her \"side\", and with coordination can walk, run, and play piano.\n\n【4】 ## One or two animals?\nIt is difficult to draw the line between what is considered \"one animal with two heads\" or \"two animals that share a body.\"  With humans, dicephalic conjoined twins such as Abigail and Brittany Hensel are considered \"twins\", i.e. two individuals .This makes sense as there is a range of conjoinedness, and non-dicephalic conjoined twins may be barely-conjoined and separable by surgery, as is the case with Chang and Eng Bunker.  Although the Hensel twins only have one pair of arms and legs total, each head controls one \"side\" of the body's limbs.  On the other hand, Syafitri, born 2006 in Indonesia, was given one name by her parents because she only had one heart.  With other animals, polycephaly is usually described as \"one animal with two heads.\" One of the heads, especially in three-headed animals, may be poorly developed and malformed, and not \"participate\" much.\n\n【5】 # Oldest occurrence\n\n【6】 # List of recent occurrences\n\n【7】 ## Humans\nDicephalic conjoined twins (dicephalus dipus):\n- In 1990, Abigail and Brittany Hensel were born in Minnesota, United States\n- In 2003, Sohna and Mohna were born in India\n- In 2004, Rebeca Martinez was born in the Dominican Republic with an extra head but died 7 hours after surgery.\n- In 2005, Egyptian Naglaa Mohamed gave birth to Manar who had the head and a remnant of a torso of another child attached. Surgery was performed for separation.   Naglaa Mohamed made an appearance on the Oprah Winfrey show with her surviving  child.\n- In 2006, Syafitri was born in Indonesia\n- In 2007, Mary Grace and Mary Divine Asis was born in the Philippines having only one heart. \n\n【8】 ## Non-human animals\n\n【9】 ### Cats\nThere have been numerous reports of two-faced cats; most die soon after birth.  Reports of two-headed kittens are common, relative to other animals, because of their status as household pets.  Recent two-headed kittens inclu\n- On 2000-06-07, Image, a two-faced kitten, was born on and died later that year in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n- On 2005-03-08, Deuce, a two-faced kitten, was born in Lake City, Florida, and was euthanased shortly thereafter, having come down with pneumonia.\n- On 2006-06-12, Gemini, a two-faced kitten was born in Glide, Oregon.\n- On 2006-07-12, Tiger, a two-faced kitten was born in Grove City, Ohio.\nPolycephalic cats in museums inclu\n- The Museum of Lausanne in Lausanne, Switzerland, preserves a two-headed kitten (pictured).\n- The Laing Museum in the small town of Newburgh, Fife, Scotland, preserves the stuffed body of a two-headed kitten born in the 19th century on Mugdrum Island.\n- The Georgia State Capitol in Atlanta, Georgia, has a full body taxidermy of a two-faced kitten.\n\n【10】 ### Cattle\n- A head mount of a two-headed calf is on display in the Museum at the Georgia State Capitol Building in Atlanta, Georgia.\n- A two-faced calf is preserved at the Douglas County Museum in Waterville, Washington. The calf lived for ten days after birth.\n- The Ripley's Believe It or Not! museum in Gatlinburg, Tennessee, has full body taxidermy of a two-headed calf.\n displays a full body taxidermy of a two-headed calf.\n- A two-headed calf mount can be found at the Old State House in Hartford, CT\n- A full taxidermy of a two headed calf can be found in Melton Mowbray museum, Leicestershire, Uk\n- A full taxidermy of a two headed calf can be found in the Museum of Marxell (in the Northern Black Forest in Germany). The calf was born by a local cow and died shortly after birth by natural causes.\n\n【11】 ### Pigs\n- In 1998, Rudy, a two-headed pig was born in Iowa.\n\n【12】 ### Goats and sheep\n- In 2006, a two-headed lamb was born in Shandong, China.\n- The Ripley's Believe It Or Not! museum in Gatlinburg, Tennessee, has a mount.\n\n【13】 ### Reptiles\n- A two-headed black rat snake with separate throats and stomachs survived for 20 years.\n- There are several preserved two-headed snakes on display in the Museum at the Georgia State Capitol Building in Atlanta.\nTwo-headed turtles and tortoises are rare but not unknown.  Recent discoveries inclu\n- In 1999, a three-headed turtle was discovered in Tainan, Taiwan, by a villager named Lin Chi-fa.\n- In 2003, a two-headed angulate tortoise was discovered in South Africa, with the only other known case in the region reported in the early 1980s.\n- In  2004, Solomon and Sheba, a two-headed Mediterranean spur-thighed tortoise was born in Dorchester, England.\n- In 2005, a two-headed olive ridley sea turtle was found in Costa Rica by the World Wildlife Fund.\n reported in Havana, Cuba, in 2005.\n featured on a local television program, and again on another program in late 2006.\n- As of 2006, a living two-headed tortoise named Janus is being displayed in the Museum of Natural History of Geneva.\n- There is a full body mount of a crocodile with two heads located at the Georgia State Capital on the top level.\n\n【14】 # Mythological occurrences\n\n【15】 ## Greek mythology\nGreek mythology contains a number of multi-headed creatures. Typhon, a vast grisly monster with a hundred heads and a hundred serpents issuing from his thighs, is often described as having several offspring with Echidna, a creature with the body of a serpent but the face of a beautiful woman. Their offspring account for all the major monsters of Greek mythos, including:\n- The Nemean Lion – a lion often depicted with multiple heads\n- Cerberus – a monstrous three-headed dog that guards the gate to Hades\n- Ladon – a sometimes hundred-headed serpentlike dragon that guards the garden of the Hesperides and is overcome by Heracles\n- Chimera – sometimes depicted with the heads of a goat and a lion\n- The Lernaean Hydra – an ancient nameless serpent-like chthonic water beast that possessed numerous heads\n- Orthrus – a two-headed dog owned by Geryon\n- The Hecatonchires were giants with fifty heads and one hundred arms. The word \"Hecatonchire\" means \"hundred arms\". They were the sons of Gaia, and Uranus.\n said to have fathered Scylla, a giant monster with six dogs' heads, which terrorises Odysseus and his crew.\n\n【16】 ## Other mythologies\n- Balaur, a dragon with three, seven or twelve heads, in Romanian mythology\n- Bune, a dragon with the heads of a dog, a griffin, and a man, in Christian demonology\n- Janus, a two- or four-faced god in Roman mythology\n- Kaliya, a multi-headed snake vanquished by Krishna in Indian mythology\n- Nehebkau, a two-headed snake in Egyptian mythology\n- Orochi, an eight-headed snake in Japanese mythology\n- Ravana, the ten-headed King of Lanka from the Hindu smriti Ramayana\n- Svantevit, four-headed god of war and divination in Slavic mythology\n- Triglav (meaning \"three headed\") is a god or complex of gods in Slavic mythology\n- Zmey Gorynych, a dragon in Slavic mythology\n\n【17】 # Modern Fiction\nModern fiction does not like anatomical variation as much as mythology, perhaps because of the need to give specific detais, which is difficult to do if the thing one is describing is impossible.

It  starts the organic synthesis of a complex enantiopure chemical compound from a stock of readily available enantiopure substances. Common chiral starting materials include monosaccharides and amino acids. The built-in chirality is then preserved in the remainder of the reaction sequence.\nThis strategy is especially helpful if the desired molecule bears a great resemblance to cheap enantiopure natural products. Otherwise, a long, tortuous synthesis involving many steps with attendant losses in yield may be required. At times, it may be difficult to find a suienantiopure starting material; other techniques may prove more fruitful.\nGeneral methods used in chiral pool synthesis are the use of protecting groups, and functional group interconversion (FGI).\n\n【2】 # Examples\nChiral pool synthesis is used to build a part of the epothilone molecule (an alternative to Paclitaxel), from readily available enantiopure (-)-pantolactone.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

This will take you through the steps necessary to upload a picture onto WikiDoc. Next, go to the page where you want the image, click edit source, bring cursor to the area where you want the image to appear and write this co\nQ: How do I hyperlink a term?\n click the 🔗 Hyperlink button located on visual edit). This will show you the pages that exist on WikiDoc corresponding to the term that you want to hyperlink.\nQ: I cannot hyperlink a term?\nA: If you cannot hyperlink a term, it may have two possible causes. The first one is that a page for that term does not exist on WikiDoc. The second reason, which is the more common of the two is that a page for the term exists but is named differently; for example, consider the following sentence: Hypertrophy of the left ventricle may lead to the following EKG changes\\. Note that a page for \"left ventricular hypertrophy\" exists but since you wrote \"hypertrophy of the left ventricle\", the platform is unable to detect your combination of terminologies. Therefore, if such a case occurs, try changing the terminology combination to match existing pages.\n\n【2】 A: Click edit source, bring the cursor to the line below the command for image. Write the following code \n- Watch a video tutorial \n\n【3】 Q: How do I create redirects for my chapter?\nA: Creating a redirect: For example, to create a redirect so that someone searching for the synonym Alport syndrome would be directed to the hereditary nephritis page, type Alport syndrome into the main search box on Wikidoc. If the page has not been created, it will say \"There were no results matching this query\". Click where it says \"create the page Alport syndrome on this Wiki!\", which will take you directly to the edit box. Type in the edit box #redirectHereditary nephritis Click the save button at the bottom of the edit box.\nQ: Why can't I see the right side of divisions/microchapters on my page?A: Open the page in question, click on \"edit source\" and make sure the command box starts with \"__NOTOC__\" followed by \"page title\" enclosed in curvy brackets in the second line. This command translates into the of divisions/microchapters for the page in question.\nQ: How do I report epidemiology in the \"Epidemiology and Demographics\" section?\nA: The epidemiology has to be reported as per 100,000 individuals according to the template for WikiDoc. For example, if the prevalence of a disease is 1.2 percent, it means every 1.2 individuals per 100 population. This must be converted to rate per 100,000 population. Therefore, 1.2 per 100 will be reported as 0.0012 per 100,000 individuals.\nQ: How do I write the \"Patient information\" section?\nA: The patient information section should be written at an \"eighth grade level\" which means that if an eighth grader is reading through, he or she should be able to understand what is being said. Use of medical jargon and complex medical terms should be avoided. You can use the CDC website to find information for the patient information section for most diseases.\nQ: What do I write under the \"Diagnostic Study of Choice\" section?\nA: The \"Diagnostic Study of Choice\" section must include the gold standard test used for that particular diseases. Please note, some diseases may have clinical criteria as the gold standard test for diagnosis, therefore, this section may include these criteria.\n\n【4】 Q: How do I create/develop \"Differential Diagnoses\" section?\nA: The \"Differential Diagnosis\" section must include all the differentials of the disease based on its clinical presentation.\nQ: What is the \"Resident Survival Guide\" and how do I approach it?\nA: Some disease conditions have \"Resident Survival Guides\" as a part of the microchapter. These disease states are commonly encountered medical emergencies seen in clinical practice and demand a guideline-derived approach to their management. The \"Resident Survival Guide\" entails disease management algorithms from clinical/laboratory recognition of such disease states and methodological management approach based on standard of care. All Resident Survival Guides must be generated using published management guidelines.\nQ: How do I create an animated GIF for images?\nA: An animated GIF image may be required to identify/mark an abnormal finding seen on a radiograph or histopathological image. In order to make this GIF, download and save the image to your computer. Next, open the image using \"Paint\" program in your computer. Use the \"circle tool\" to mark the abnormal finding in the image. Now you have two copies of the same image, one unmarked and the other marked. Next, go to / and upload both these images to the website. Set the animation speed at 2400 milliseconds. Download the animated GIF and upload it to your chapter on WikiDoc the same way you would upload an image.\n- Watch a video tutorial \nQ: What do I do when there are no published primary/secondary prevention methods for the disease?\nA: If there are no published primary/secondary prevention methods for the disease, do not leave the section blank.

These cells are bipolar neurons with a dendrite facing the interior space of the nasal cavity and an axon that travels along the olfactory nerve to the olfactory bulb.\n\n【3】 ## Structure\nMany tiny hair-like cilia protrude from the olfactory receptor cell's dendrite into the mucus covering the surface of the olfactory epithelium.  The surface of these cilia is covered with olfactory receptors, a type of G protein-coupled receptor. Each olfactory receptor cell expresses only one type of olfactory receptor, but many separate olfactory receptor cells express olfactory receptors which bind the same set of odors.  The axons of olfactory receptor cells which bind the same odors glomeruli in the olfactory bulb.\n\n【4】 ## Function\nA given olfactory receptor can bind to a variety of odor molecules with varying affinities. The activated olfactory receptor in turn activates the intracellular G-protein GOLF (GNAL), and adenylate cyclase and production of Cyclic AMP opens ion channels in the cell membrane, resulting in an influx of sodium and calcium ions into the cell. This influx of positive ions causes the neuron to depolarize, generating an action potential.\n\n【5】 ## Regeneration\nIndividual olfactory receptor neurons are replaced approximately every 40 days by neural stem cells residing in the olfactory epithelium.  The regeneration of olfactory receptor cells, as one of the only few instances of adult neurogenesis in the central nervous system, has raised considerable interest in dissecting the pathways for neural development and differentiation in adult organisms.\n\n【6】 # In insects\nIn insects, olfactory receptor neurons typically reside on the antenna. Much like in vertebrates, axons from the sensory neurons converge into glomeruli in the antennal lobe.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

These case definitions and reporting guidelines were used by CDC and the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs during the mandatory Department of Defense (DoD) and voluntary U.S. DHHS smallpox vaccination programs that were designed to increase national preparedness in the event of a biologic terrorism attack .\nAdverse reactions caused by smallpox vaccination range from mild and self-limited to severe and life-threatening. During the recent smallpox vaccination programs, CDC, DoD, and the joint Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)-Armed Forces Epidemiological Board (AFEB) Smallpox Vaccine Safety Working Group (SVS WG) relied on surveillance data from the smallpox pre-eradication era to estimate frequencies of adverse reactions expected during these vaccination programs. These estimates might be limited because the targeted population during the 1960s was mostly children who had never been previously vaccinated; the recent program targeted healthy adults, some of whom had received smallpox vaccines . Furthermore, adverse reactions during the 1960s were classified and reported by providers on the basis of subjective clinical diagnosis, and standard collection or analytical tools were not applied to the clinical data . Without explicit criteria for identifying cases for public health surveillance, state health departments and individual practitioners often apply different criteria for reporting similar cases . Surveillance data for adverse reactions after smallpox vaccination must be aggressively pursued and standardized to assess accurately the frequency of adverse events after smallpox vaccination.\nThis report describes the case definitions used to classify reported adverse events during the DHHS smallpox vaccination program. The overall safety surveillance system and related findings are reported elsewhere .\n\n【1】 # Reporting Guidelines\nThese surveillance case definitions establish reporting criteria for prospective or retrospective classification of cases\n\n【2】 # Case Definition and Classification\nACIP-AFEB SVS WG was responsible for safety oversight of the DHHS and DoD smallpox preparedness programs. The majority of the case definitions for vaccinia adverse reactions were drafted by the Vaccinia Case Definition Development working group in collaboration with ACIP-AFEB SVS WG. The Vaccinia Case Definition Development working group membership included CDC and DoD medical epidemiologists, smallpox eradication experts, ophthalmologists, dermatologists, cardiologists, and infectious-disease specialists. These work groups contributed to the development of case definitions by completing literature searches, translating publications, coordinating or participating in meetings, collecting or analyzing data, investigating cases, providing subject-matter expertise, and drafting and revising case definitions. The case definition for fetal vaccinia was developed by CDC and DoD for use in the development of the National Smallpox Vaccine in Pregnancy Registry .\nFor all cases, exposure to vaccinia is required; vaccination, close contact with a recent vaccinee, or intrauterine exposure can fulfill this criterion. Vaccinia virus can be transmitted from the vaccination site to close contacts of persons who received smallpox vaccine, and these contacts can experience the same adverse reactions as vaccinees.\nSmallpox vaccine adverse events can be divided into several categories. Localized reactions include a superinfection of the vaccination site or regional lymph nodes and robust take (RT). Unintentional transfer of vaccinia virus includes transfer from the vaccination site to elsewhere on the vaccinee's body and is called inadvertent autoinoculation. When the virus is transferred from the vaccinee to a close contact, it is called contact transmission. In either case, if the virus is transferred to the eye and surrounding orbit, it is referred to as ocular vaccinia. Diffuse dermatologic complications include two groups. The first group (hypersensitivity rashes) includes nonspecific, postvaccination rash, erythema multiforme minor, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. These lesions are not thought to contain vaccinia virus, and because these terms are defined elsewhere in the dermatologic literature, they not included in this report. The second group of diffuse dermatologic complications is thought to be caused by replicating vaccinia virus that can be recovered from the rash of generalized vaccinia (GV) (usually a benign, self-limiting condition), eczema vaccinatum (EV) (often associated with substantial morbidity), and progressive vaccinia (PV) (which is generally fatal). Rare adverse reactions include fetal vaccinia and postvaccinial central nervous system diseases such as post-vaccinial encephalitis or encephalomyelitis. Other reactions previously reported but not well described include the newly characterized cardiac adverse reaction, myo/pericarditis (M/P) or the newly described cardiac adverse event dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), which has not been yet been demonstrated to be etiologically linked.\n\n【3】 # Localized Reactions\n\n【4】 # Superinfection of the Vaccination Site or Regional Lymph Nodes\n might be expected.\nDistinguishing superinfection of the vaccination site or regional lymph nodes can be particularly challenging because both a bacterial cellulitis and a variant of the normal major reaction or RT have similar signs and symptoms.\n\n【5】 # Robust Take\nAn RT is a vaccinial cellulitis and is defined as >3 inches (7.5 cm) of redness with swelling, pain, and warmth at the vaccination site. These symptoms peak on days 6-12 postvaccination and regress within the following 24-72 hours. RTs can occur in up to 16% of smallpox vaccinees . In contrast to an RT, superinfections refer to cellulitis caused by agents other than vaccinia.\n\n【6】 # Unintentional Transfer of Vaccinia Virus Inadvertent Autoinoculation\nUnintentional transfer of vaccinia virus includes transfer from the vaccination site (or probable site of inoculation in a person infected with vaccinia through contract transmission) to elsewhere on the vaccinee's (or contact's) body, which is called inadvertent autoinoculation (Box . Smallpox vaccinees or contacts can transfer vaccinia virus to their hands or fomites, which becomes a source for infection elsewhere on the body. The most common nonocular sites are the face, nose, mouth, lips, genitalia, and anus. Lesions at autoinoculation sites progress through the same stages (e.g., papular, vesicular, pustular, crusting, and scab) as the vaccination site. When autoinoculation occurs >5 days postvaccination, the developing immune response might attenuate the lesions and their progression. Persons at highest risk for inadvertent autoinoculation are children aged 1-4 years and those with disruption of the epidermis, including but not limited to abrasions and burns .\n\n【7】 # Contact Transmission\nWhen the virus is transferred from the vaccinee to a close contact, this transmission is termed contact transmission. Persons in close contact with a recent vaccinee or associated vectors (e.g., distant lesions on a vaccinee resulting from inadvertent autoinoculation, clothing, bedding, or bandages contaminated by vaccinia) might acquire vaccinia infection. Vaccinia virus is shed from the vaccination site or from dis-tant lesions caused by autoinoculation, GV, EV, or PV (Box . Viral shedding might occur until the scab detaches from the vaccination site or distant lesions; virus can survive for several days on clothing, bedding, or other fomites . Although virus exists in the scab, it is bound in the fibrinous matrix, and the scab is not thought to be highly infectious . Infection acquired through contact transmission can result in the same adverse events observed after smallpox vaccination.\n\n【8】 # Ocular Vaccinia\nIn the case of either contact transmission or inadvertent autoinoculation, if the virus is transferred to the eye and surrounding orbit, this transmission is referred to as ocular vac-cinia. Ocular vaccinial infections result from the transfer of vaccinia from the vaccine site or other lesion containing vaccinia to or near the eye. These infections account for the majority of inadvertent inoculations  (Box . Infections can be clinically mild to severe and can lead to vision loss. When suspected, ocular vaccinia infections should be evaluated with a thorough eye examination, including use of a slit lamp. These cases should be managed in consultation with an ophthalmologist.\n\n【9】 # Diffuse Dermatologic Complications\nDiffuse dermatologic complications include two groups. The first includes erythema multiforme minor and Stevens-Johnson syndrome, which are clinically defined elsewhere in the der-Superinfection of the vaccination site or regional lymph nodes is defined as a nonvaccinial superinfection (e.g., superinfection caused by bacterial, fungal, atypical, or viral organisms) that produces a local inflammatory response at the site of vaccination and can present with the same signs and symptoms as vaccinia virus replication at the vaccination site.\n\n【10】 # Case definition for superinfection of the vaccination site or regional lymph nodes\nA suspected case of superinfection of the vaccination site or regional lymph nodes is defined by the following criteria:\n- vaccination site or regional lymph nodes with three or more of the following findings: -dolor (pain and/or tenderness), -calor (warmth), -rubor (redness), and -other (regional lymphadenopathy; lymphangitic streaking; edema, induration and/or swelling; fluctuance; and blister with pus or honey-crusted plaque); and - temporal criterion: -onset or peak symptoms occur from day of vaccination to day 5 after vaccination and/or day 13-60 after vaccination (excludes days 6-12 after vaccination); and - clinical course: -clinical criteria persist or worsen for hours to days after vaccination; patient report is adequate.\n\n【11】 # BOX 1. Surveillance case definition for superinfection of the vaccination site or regional lymph nodes after smallpox vaccination for use in smallpox vaccine adverse event monitoring and response\nA confirmed case of superinfection of the vaccination site or regional lymph nodes is defined by the following criteria:\n- vaccination site or regional lymph nodes with three or more of the following findings:\n-dolor (pain and/or tenderness), -calor (warmth), -rubor (redness), and -other (regional lymphadenopathy; lymphangitic streaking; edema, induration and/or swelling; fluctuance; and blister with pus or honey-crusted plaque); and - temporal criterion: -symptoms occur from day of vaccination to 60 days after vaccination (inclusive); and - laboratory criteria having one or more of the following findings:\n-positive results of pathogenic culture (e.g., bacterial, fungal, atypical, or nonvaccinial viral culture), -positive microscopy results (e.g., Gram stain, silver stain, acid-fast bacillus stain, or darkfield), and -positive result of bioburden testing- of the vaccinia vaccine vial; or - radiographic findings: -findings consistent with superinfection (e.g., lymphadenopathy or abscess) by magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography scan, or ultrasound.\nmatologic literature .\n\n【12】 # Generalized Vaccinia\n should be differentiated from EV, which typically occurs in persons with a history of atopic dermatitis and is often associated with systemic illness.\n\n【13】 # Eczema Vaccinatum\nPersons with a history of atopic dermatitis (i.e., eczema) are at highest risk for EV (Box . Onset of the characteristic lesions can occur concurrently or shortly after the occurrence of the reaction at the vaccination site. EV cases resulting from Inadvertent autoinoculation occurs when a person who has received smallpox vaccine or experienced inoculation from contact might physically transfer vaccinia virus from vaccination or contact site to another part of the body through scratching or through inanimate objects such as clothing, dressings, or bedding. The most common sites of inadvertent autoinoculation, nonocular are the face, nose, mouth, lips, genitalia, and anus. Lesions at autoinoculation sites progress through the same papular, vesicular, and pustular stages as the vaccination site. When autoinoculation occurs more than 5 days postvaccination, the developing immune response might attenuate the lesions and their progression. Persons at highest risk for inadvertent autoinoculation are children aged 1-4 years and those with disruption of the epidermis, including, but not limited to, abrasions or burns.\n\n【14】 # Case definition for inadvertent autoinoculation (nonocular)\nA suspected case of inadvertent autoinoculation is defined by the following criteria:\n- affected person has been recently vaccinated and had one or more lesions at one or more sites beyond the boundaries of the dressing that was used. Lesions progress morphologically through papule, vesicle, pustule, and scab,- and\n\n【15】 # BOX 2. Surveillance case definition for inadvertent autoinoculation (nonocular) for use in smallpox vaccine adverse event monitoring and response\n- lesions appear up to 10 days after the period beginning with initial vaccination or contact through final resolution and scarring of lesions at vaccination or contact inoculation site. A probable case of inadvertent autoinoculation meets the criteria for a suspected case and - does not meet the case definition for generalized vaccinia*, eczema vaccinatum, or progressive vaccinia, and - other likely etiologies (e.g., bacterial or viral infection) have been excluded. A confirmed case of inadvertent autoinoculation meets the criteria for a suspected or probable case of inadvertent autoinoculation and has the following laboratory evidence of vaccinia infection (on the basis of testing skin lesions distant from the vaccination site in a vaccinee):\n- positive test results for vaccinia polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay or antigen detection techniques (e.g., direct fluorescent assay or direct fluorescent antibody), or - demonstration of vaccinia virus by culture. Early diagnosis of EV and administration of VIG is helpful to reduce associated morbidity and mortality. Two thirds of potential smallpox vaccinees failed to recall an exclusionary dermatologic condition such as atopic dermatitis (eczema) in themselves or their close contacts . Poor recall and inconsistent diagnosis of atopic dermatitis contributes to a challenging screening program to exclude persons at risk for EV . Therefore, when evaluating vaccinees or close contacts of recent vaccinees with a clinical presentation consistent with EV, despite a negative self-reported history of atopic dermatitis or Darier's disease, clinicians should consider EV and assess for treatment with VIG.\n\n【16】 # Progressive Vaccinia\n can occur. PV typically occurs in persons with an underlying humoral or cellular immune deficit. Management of PV should include aggressive therapy with VIG or second line agent cidofovir, intensive monitoring, and tertiary-level supportive care .\n\n【17】 # Rare Reactions Fetal Vaccinia\nRarely, smallpox vaccination of a pregnant woman can result in fetal vaccinia (Box . Transmission to the fetus can occur any time during pregnancy. The route of transmission is unknown but is presumed to be through viremia. Abortion, stillbirth, or live birth (usually premature followed by death) or birth of a surviving but pox-scarred infant can occur after the mother's exposure to vaccinia. Fetal or newborn skin lesions have been described as macular, papular, vesicular, pustular, or as scars or areas of epidermolysis . Contact transmission of vaccinia virus occurs when virus shed from smallpox vaccination sites or from distant lesions in persons with inadvertent autoinoculation, generalized vaccinia (GV), eczema vaccinatum (EV), or progressive vaccinia (PV) is transferred to another person. Virus might be shed until the scab heals. The virus can survive for several days on clothing, bedding, or other inanimate surfaces. An unvaccinated or nonrecently vaccinated person in close contact (i.e., touching a person's lesions or vaccination site, clothing, bedding, or bandages) with a vaccinee or their inanimate objects might acquire vaccinia infection. Infection acquired through contact transmission can result in inadvertent autoinoculation from the exposure site to additional sites (including ocular vaccinia) or can result in other adverse reactions.\n\n【18】 # Case definition for contact transmission (nonocular)\nA suspected case of contract transmission is defined as - the development one or more lesions that progress through papule, vesicle, or pustule stages; - history of close contact with -someone who has received the vaccine <3 weeks before the exposure, or -someone who has had autoinoculation GV, EV, and PV diagnosed; and - lesions appear 3-9 days after vaccinia exposure. A probable case of contact transmission meets the case definition for suspected case, and other likely etiologies (e.g., bacterial or viral infection) have been excluded.\nFor a confirmed case of contact transmission, laboratory evidence of vaccinia infection exists on the basis of testing skin lesions in a close contact of a known vaccinee. Laboratory evidence of vaccinia infection includes\n- positive test results for vaccinia polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay or antigen detection techniques (e.g., direct fluorescent antibody) or - demonstration of vaccinia virus by culture. Note: Histopathologic examination showing typical orthopox cytopathic changes or electron microscopy of biopsy specimens revealing orthopox virus is strongly suggestive of infection with vaccinia and should be confirmed by subsequent PCR or culture.\n\n【19】 # BOX 3. Surveillance case definition for contact transmission (nonocular) for use in smallpox vaccine adverse event monitoring and response\n\n【20】 # Postvaccinial Central Nervous System Disease\nAnother rare adverse reaction is postvaccinial central nervous system (CNS) disease such as postvaccinial encephalitis (PVE) or encephalomyelitis (PVEM). CNS disease after smallpox vaccination is most common among infants aged <12 months  (Box . Clinical symptoms reflect cerebral or cerebellar dysfunction with headache, fever, vomiting, altered mental status, lethargy, seizures, and coma. CNS lesions have been reported in the cerebrum, medulla, and spinal cord. Both PVE and PVEM have been described . No clinical criteria, radiologic findings, or laboratory tests exist that are di-agnostic for PVE or PVEM. Other infectious or toxic etiologies should be considered and ruled out; the diagnosis of PVE or PVEM after smallpox vaccination is a diagnosis of exclusion.\n\n【21】 # Cardiac Myo/pericarditis\nAn adverse reaction previously reported but not well described is myo/pericarditis. During 1950-1970, both myocarditis and pericarditis were reported after smallpox vaccination in Europe and Australia, where the vaccinia strains Ocular vaccinia is the appearance of lesions suspicious for vaccinia in or near the eye in a vaccinee (or close contact of a vaccinee) up to 10 days after the period beginning with initial vaccinia exposure through final resolution and scarring of lesions at vaccination site or exposure site, to include periocular- involvement, lid involvement (blepharitis  ), conjunctival involvement (conjunctivitis  ), and/or corneal involvement (keratitis  ).\n\n【22】 # Case definition for ocular vaccinia\nA suspected case of ocular vaccinia is defined as the new onset of erythema or edema of the conjunctiva (conjunctivitis), eyelid (blepharitis), or periocular area or inflammation of the cornea (keratitis) in a recent vaccinee (or close contact of vaccinee) that cannot be ascribed to another ocular diagnosis and - Temporal criteria of -onset after vaccinia exposure but not more than 10 days after the period beginning with initial vaccinia exposure through final resolution and scarring of lesions at vaccination site or exposure site or -onset during the presence of visible vaccinia lesions before scab separation.\nA probable case of ocular vaccinia is the presentation in or near the eye of lesions consistent with vaccinia infection to include formation of vesicles that progress to pustules that umbilicate and indurate in a manner similar to a normal vaccinia reaction (Note: see exceptions/differences to conjunctival and cornea clinical presentation footnotes  and  ) and - Temporal criteria of -onset after vaccinia exposure but not more than 10 days after the period beginning with initial vaccinia exposure through final resolution and scarring of lesions at vaccination site or exposure site or -onset during the presence of visible vaccinia lesions before scab separation. A confirmed case of ocular vaccinia meets the criteria as a probable or suspected case of ocular vaccinia with laboratory evidence of vaccinia infection (testing lesions on or near the eye). Laboratory evidence includes -positive test results for vaccinia polymerase chain reaction assay or antigen detection techniques (e.g., direct fluorescent antibody) or -demonstration of vaccinia virus by culture.\n\n【23】 # BOX 4. Surveillance case definition for ocular vaccinia for use in smallpox vaccine adverse event monitoring and response\n- Periocular involvement (generally above the brow or below the inferior orbital rim) Papules, vesicles, or pustules not involving the ocular adnexa, lids, lid margins, or canthi.  Blepharitis: (lid involvement): Mild -few pustules, mild edema, and no fever; Severe -pustules, edema, hyperemia, lymphadenopathy (preauricular or submandibular), cellulitis, and fever.  Conjunctivitis (involvement of membrane that lines inner surface of the eyelid and exposed surface of the eyeball, excluding the cornea): Conjunctiva might be inflamed (red) with serous or mucopurulent discharge if lesions involve the conjunctiva or cornea. Symptoms of ocular irritation (foreign body sensation) might be present with onset of erythema. Conjunctival lesions typically form vesicles that rapidly ulcerate and form raised \"moist appearing\" white lesions (rather than pustules that scab) before final resolution: Mild -mild hyperemia or edema, no membranes or focal lesions; Severe -marked hyperemia, edema, membranes, focal lesions, lymphadenopathy (preauricular and/or submandibular), and fever.  Keratitis (corneal involvement): Corneal lesions might present as a grey-appearing superficial punctuate keratitis that might later coalesce to form a geographic epithelial defect resembling herpes simplex keratitis. Stromal corneal lesions might present as small subepithelial opacities resembling those observed in epidemic keratoconjunctivitis, might be associated with epithelial defect, and might progress to corneal haze/clouding: Mild -grey epitheliitis, no epithelial defect, and no stromal haze or infiltrate (cloudy cornea); Moderate -epithelial defect; Severe -ulcer, stromal haze, or infiltrate.\n\n【24】 # MMWR February 3, 2006\n can appear as a regional form that is characterized by extensive vesiculation around the vaccination site or as an eruption localized to a single body region. The skin lesions of GV are thought to contain virus spread by the hematogenous route. Primary vaccinees are at higher risk for GV than revaccinees. GV is usually self-limited among immunocompetent hosts. Vaccinia immune globulin (VIG) might be beneficial in the rare case where an immunocompetent person appears systemically ill. GV is often more severe among persons with underlying immunodeficiency, and these patients might benefit from early intervention with VIG.\nNotes:  Systemic symptoms might be present.\n At early onset of some cases, skin lesions might be macules or slightly elevated papules; in late cases, lesions might have developed scabs.  History or clinical signs of eczema/atopic dermatitis or Darier's disease or severe illness should prompt evaluation for eczema vaccinatum.  Presence of acute or chronic exfoliative, erosive, or blistering skin disease (e.g., acute burn and epidermolytic hyperkeratosis) should prompt consideration of multiple inadvertent inoculations.  A vaccinial skin eruption characterized by grouped vesicles or pustules close to or surrounding the vaccination site but do not appear to be satellite lesions (e.g., on the basis of the presence of a large number of lesions and evidence that the lesions are caused by hematogenous spread of vaccinia) might constitute a regional form of generalized vaccinia.\n\n【25】 # Case definition for generalized vaccinia\nA probable case of generalized vaccinia occurs in persons recently vaccinated or in a close contact of a recent vaccinee and meets the following criteria:\n- a vesicular or pustular eruption at one or more body areas distant from the vaccination site or inadvertent inoculation site, - skin eruption occurring approximately 4-19 days after smallpox vaccination or contact with someone vaccinated against smallpox, - lesions follow approximately the same morphologic progression as a primary vaccination site (i.e., papule, vesicle, pustule, scab, and scar), - unlikely that autoinoculation accounts for skin eruption, and - other likely etiologies have been excluded. A confirmed case of generalized vaccinia can occur in a recent vaccinee, a known close contact of a recent vaccinee, or someone with no known contact but who otherwise meets the criteria for a probable case and no laboratory evidence of vaccinia infection (on the basis of testing skin lesions distal from vaccination site in a vaccinee or distal to likely inoculation site ) exists in a close contact of a known vaccinee or in a patient who is not known to be a close contact.\n- Laboratory evidence of vaccinia infection includes -demonstration of vaccinia virus by culture or -histopathologic examination shows typical orthopox cytopathic changes, and either polymerase chain reaction assay or antigen detection techniques (e.g., direct fluorescent antibody) revealing vaccinia or electron microscopy of biopsy specimens revealing orthopox virus are strongly suggestive of infection with vaccinia and should be confirmed by subsequent culture.\n\n【26】 # BOX 5. Surveillance case definition for generalized vaccinia after smallpox vaccination for use in smallpox vaccine adverse event monitoring and response\nused are considered more reactogenic than the New York City Board of Health (NYCBOH) vaccine used in the United States . In the United States, six cases were reported before the resumption of smallpox vaccination in late 2002 .\nFindings from the DHHS and DoD smallpox programs support a causal relation between smallpox vaccination with the NYCBOH strain and myo/pericarditis . Myo/pericarditis refers to inflammatory disease of the myocardium, pericardium, or both. The clinical presentation of inflammatory heart disease can include pain, dyspnea, and palpitations that range from subtle to severe. Results of specific cardiac diagnostic testing are variable. The case definition (Box  was designed to include the spectrum of abnormalities found in inflammatory heart disease .\n\n【27】 # Dilated Cardiomyopathy\nAn adverse event noted in temporal association to smallpox vaccination but not demonstrated to be linked etiologically to smallpox vaccination is dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). DCM is a known sequelae of viral myocarditis and can present weeks to months after acute infection . Although DCM has not been reported in association with vaccinia vaccination, three DCM cases with symptom onset after smallpox vaccination were identified among DHHS vaccinees .\nEczema vaccinatum (EV) is a localized or generalized papular, vesicular, pustular, or erosive rash syndrome that can occur anywhere on the body, with a predilection for areas currently or previously affected by atopic dermatitis lesions. Persons with a history of atopic dermatitis are at highest risk for EV. Onset of the characteristic lesions can be noted either concurrently with or shortly after the development of the local vaccinial lesion in vaccinees. EV cases resulting from secondary transmission usually appear with skin eruptions approximately 5-19 days after the suspected exposure. EV lesions follow the same dermatologic course (progression) as the vaccination site in a vaccinee, and confluent or erosive lesions can occur. The rash is often accompanied by fever and lymphadenopathy, and affected persons are frequently systemically ill. EV tends to be most severe among first-time vaccinees, young children, and unvaccinated close contacts of vaccinees. Before the availability of vaccinia immune globulin (VIG), this condition had a high mortality. Establishing the diagnosis early and treating with VIG is crucial in reducing mortality.\nNotes:  Although a history consistent with eczema/atopic dermatitis or Darier's disease (i.e., keratosis follicularis) is included in the surveillance definition for EV, clinicians evaluating vaccinees or close contacts of recent vaccinees with a presentation consistent with EV who do not report having one of these dermatologic conditions should still consider EV as a clinical diagnosis and assess for treatment with VIG.  Lesions of EV are in approximately the same stage of morphologic development as each other and progress.\n\n【28】 # Case definition for eczema vaccinatum\nA probable case of EV occurs in persons recently vaccinated or in a known close contact of a recent vaccinee and meets the following criteria:\n- a history of or current exfoliative skin condition consistent with a diagnosis of eczema/atopic dermatitis or Darier's disease; and\n\n【29】 # BOX 6. Surveillance case definition for eczema vaccinatum after smallpox vaccination for use in smallpox vaccine adverse event monitoring and response\n- multiple skin lesions that developed -in a vaccinated person concurrently or soon after lesion at vaccination site or in a close contact of a recent vaccinee up to 3 weeks after exposure, if time of relevant exposure is known, -are distant from the vaccination or likely inoculation site (i.e., are unlikely to be satellite lesions), and -are or have become vesicular/pustular sometime during their evolution (i.e., do not remain macular or papular). Erosive or ulcerative lesions might be observed; and - other likely etiologies have been excluded such as eczema herpeticum (which can be particularly difficult to distinguish), smallpox, chickenpox, disseminated herpes zoster, or pustular (bacterial) impetigo. A confirmed case of EV can occur in a recent vaccinee, a known close contact of a recent vaccinee, or someone with no known contact but who otherwise meets the criteria for a probable case and laboratory evidence of vaccinia infection exists (on the basis of testing skin lesions distal from vaccination site in a vaccinee or distal to likely inoculation site, if identifiable) in a close contact of a known vaccinee or in a patient who is not known to be a close contact.\n- Laboratory evidence of vaccinia infection includes -demonstration of vaccinia virus by culture or -polymerase chain reaction assay or antigen detection techniques (e.g., direct fluorescent antibody) revealing vaccinia, histopathologic examination showing typical orthopox cytopathic changes, and electron microscopy of biopsy specimens revealing orthopox virus are strongly suggestive of infection with vaccinia and should be confirmed by subsequent culture.\n\n【30】 # MMWR February 3, 2006\n\n【31】 # Case Classification\n might be determined on the basis of other evidence in instances in which vaccinia presence is not a pathognomonic feature of the entity under surveillance (e.g., myocarditis or pericarditis, both of which are believed to be an immune-mediated response to vaccination rather than mediated through vaccinia viral infection).\nClassification of certain smallpox adverse vaccine reactions can be confounded by lack of information or the absence of pathognomonic findings. This is illustrated by the limited un-Progressive vaccinia (PV) refers to continued vaccinia virus replication with progressive infection of skin surrounding the vaccination site or inadvertent inoculation site and sometimes the occurrence of secondary metastatic lesions in a person with underlying immune deficit (humoral or cellular). The condition is rare, severe, and often lethal. The description of the vaccination site lesion is usually that of a necrotic lesion; however, this is not the only presentation described with PV. Lesions can appear \"clean,\" fungated, piled-up, well-demarcated, or have bacterial superinfection.\n\n【32】 # Case definition for progressive vaccinia\nA suspected case of PV occurs in persons recently vaccinated or in a known close contact of a recent vaccinee and meets the following criteria:\n- have a known or suspected depressed or defective immune system (suspicion might arise as result of clinical suspicion of PV); and - have a vaccination site lesion or inadvertent inoculation site with one of the following criteria: -no or minimal inflammatory response around lesion associated with a nonhealing or enlarging vaccination lesion, -progressive expansion at or after 15 days of vaccination, or -Failure to heal or failure of lesion to regress at or after 15 days of vaccination; and - other likely etiologies (e.g., bacterial superinfection) have been excluded. A probable case of PV occurs in persons recently vaccinated or in a known close contact of a recent vaccinee and meets the following criteria:\n- a known or suspected depressed or defective immune system and - a vaccination site lesion or inadvertent inoculation site with one of the following criteria: -no or minimal inflammatory response around lesion associated with a nonhealing or enlarging vaccination lesion, -progressive expansion at or after 21 days of vaccination, or -failure to heal or failure of lesion to regress at or after 21 days of vaccination; and - other likely etiologies (e.g., bacterial superinfection) have been excluded. A confirmed case of PV can occur in a recent vaccinee, a known close contact of a recent vaccinee, or someone with no known contact but who otherwise meets the criteria for a suspected case and laboratory evidence of vaccinia infection (on the basis of testing skin lesions at least 15 days after vaccination or likely time of inoculation in a close contact of a recent vaccinee or in persons with no known contact with a vaccinee) exist Laboratory evidence of vaccinia infection include - demonstration of vaccinia virus by culture or - histopathologic examination showing typical orthopox cytopathic changes, and either polymerase chain reaction assay or antigen detection techniques (e.g., direct fluorescent antibody) revealing vaccinia or electron microscopy of biopsy specimens revealing orthopox virus are strongly suggestive of infection with vaccinia and should be confirmed by subsequent culture.\n\n【33】 # BOX 7. Surveillance case definition for progressive vaccinia for use in smallpox vaccine adverse event monitoring and response\n been described. Vaccinia infection in products of conception occurs rarely.\n\n【34】 # Case definition for fetal vaccinia\nA suspected case of fetal vaccinia is the presence of any skin lesion in a fetus or newborn exposed to vaccinia virus in utero and no other attribucause.\nA probable case of fetal vaccinia is the presence of multiple skin lesions that might include macules, papules, vesicles, pustules, scars, ulcers, areas of maceration, or epidermolysis (blisters/bullae) in a fetus or newborn exposed to vaccinia in utero and no other attribucause.\nA confirmed case of fetal vaccinia meets the criteria for a probable case and has laboratory evidence for vaccinial infection:\nLaboratory criteria for diagnosis includes - positive test results for vaccinia virus by polymerase chain reaction assay or antigen detection techniques (e.g., direct fluorescent antibody), or - demonstration of vaccinia virus by culture. Vaccinia infection: Fetus, newborn, or product of conception with laboratory evidence of infection and without any clinical symptoms or signs.\n\n【35】 # BOX 8. Surveillance case definition for fetal vaccinia for use in smallpox vaccine adverse event monitoring and response\nderstanding of the vaccinia virus' pathogenesis and the relevance of vaccinia testing in conditions such as postvaccinial CNS diseases and fetal vaccinia. No large-scale study examining the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) of smallpox vaccinees exists; therefore, the significance of the presence or absence of vaccinia neutralizing antibodies or vaccinia virus recovered from the CSF of a vaccinee with CNS findings is not fully understood. Testing for the presence or absence of vaccinia virus cannot confirm or refute a smallpox vaccine-associated etiology for these conditions. Conversely, the inability to recover vaccinia virus from burnt-out lesions from an infant exposed to vaccinia in utero and born with skin lesions com-patible with fetal vaccinia does not mean that intrauterine infection did not occur. To address these limitations, the suspected category for these adverse reactions allows a clinically compatible case with indeterminate or no testing to remain under consideration.\n\n【36】 # Vaccinia Laboratory Diagnostics\n should be completed for these viruses.\nLaboratory testing for vaccinia is still largely a research tool assisting the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of adverse reactions after smallpox vaccination. Testing is available through the Laboratory Response Network (LRN) , which can be accessed through state and local health departments with confirmatory testing at CDC. Diagnostic techniques that can aid in the detection of vaccinia include electron microscopy (EM), viral culture, and PCR . Although these tests can identify orthopoxviruses, only certain PCR tests or biologic characterization of viral growth on chick chorioallantoic membrane specifically identifies the presence of vaccinia virus. Positive results for EM, PCR, and viral culture should be interpreted with caution. EM or culture results compatible with orthopox virus and presumed to be vaccinia might be another zoonotic orthopox virus or, in the worst case scenario, variola itself. Experience with vaccinia diagnostics is limited. Molecular contamination resulting in false-positive PCR results can occur. Therefore, use of appropriate controls is essential. PCR techniques, which test for orthopoxvirus nucleic acid presence, at LRN have undergone multicenter validation studies, and these data along with clinical experience with these assays is being compiled to enable the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to review the test reagents and assay for wider diagnostic use . Serologic testing of single serum samples for vaccinia is of limited value because it cannot discern existing immunity from recent infection. Testing of paired acute and convalescent sera antibody titers is rarely available during initial assessment of a suspected vaccinia adverse event .\n\n【37】 # Conclusions\nSurveillance case definitions rely on a constellation of clinical, laboratory, and epidemiologic criteria for classification. They are not intended to replace clinical judgment and should not be used to direct individual patient care, assess causality, or determine disability compensation or reimbursement for medical care. The definitions have been developed specifically for the surveillance of adverse events during the voluntary DHHS civilian smallpox preparedness and response program and might not apply to vaccinees in other settings (e.g., clini-\n\n【38】 # BOX 10. Surveillance case definition for myo/pericarditis for use in smallpox vaccine adverse event monitoring and response\n\n【39】 # Myo/pericarditis\nMyo/pericarditis is defined as a spectrum of disease caused by inflammation of the myocardium and/or pericardium. Patients might have symptoms and signs consistent with myocarditis, pericarditis, or both. For the purpose of surveillance reporting, patients with myocarditis or pericarditis will be reported as having myo/pericarditis. These categories are intended for surveillance purposes and not for use in individual diagnosis or treatment decisions.\n\n【40】 # Case definition for acute myocarditis\nA suspected case of acute myocarditis is defined by the following criteria and the absence of evidence of any other likely cause of symptoms or findings below:\n- presence of dyspnea, palpitations, or chest pain of probable cardiac origin in a patient with either one of the following:\n-electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities beyond normal variants, not documented previously, including -ST-segment or T-wave abnormalities, -paroxysmal or sustained atrial or ventricular arrhythmias, -AV nodal conduction delays or intraventricular conduction defects, or -continuous ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring that detects frequent atrial or ventricular ectopy or -Evidence of focal or diffuse depressed left-ventricular (LV) function of indeterminate age identified by an imaging study (e.g., echocardiography or radionuclide ventriculography). A probable case of acute myocarditis, in addition to the above symptoms and in the absence of evidence of any other likely cause of symptoms, has one of the following:\n- elevated cardiac enzymes, specifically, abnormal levels of cardiac troponin I, troponin T, or creatine kinase myocardial band (a troponin test is preferred);\n- evidence of focal or diffuse depressed LV function identified by an imaging study  indicating myocardial inflammation. A case of acute myocarditis is confirmed if histopathologic evidence of myocardial inflammation is found at endomyocardial biopsy or autopsy.\n\n【41】 # Case definition for acute pericarditis\nA suspected case of acute pericarditis is defined by the presence of - typical chest pain (i.e., pain made worse by lying down and relieved by sitting up and/or leaning forward) and - no evidence of any other likely cause of such chest pain. A probable case of acute pericarditis is a suspected case of pericarditis, or a case in a person with pleuritic or other chest pain not characteristic of any other disease, that, in addition, has one or more of the following:\n- pericardial rub, an auscultatory sign with one to three components per beat, - ECG with diffuse ST-segment elevations or PR depressions without reciprocal ST depressions that are not previously documented, or - echocardiogram indicating the presence of an abnormal collection of pericardial fluid (e.g., anterior and posterior pericardial effusion or a large posterior pericardial effusion alone). Note: A case of acute pericarditis is confirmed if histopathologic evidence of pericardial inflammation is evident from pericardial tissue obtained at surgery or autopsy.\n\n【42】 # Surveillance Results and Outcome\nThe voluntary DHHS civilian smallpox preparedness and response program established adverse event case monitoring capacity and response within CDC and state and local health departments. Data collected were derived from the standardized case definitions and enabled rapid classification, reporting, and the ability to compare adverse reaction surveillance data from various sources. Accurate classification of vaccinia adverse reactions is necessary for appropriate use of VIG and cidofovir for the treatment of select vaccinia reactions. cal trials). These surveillance case definitions might not apply to the international community, which administers non-NYCBOH vaccinia strains and faces different considerations in health-care use and surveillance systems. These case definitions are a component of a dynamic surveillance process. As knowledge and experience increase, they might be modified or improved. Ongoing input from health-care providers and health departments are important for the successful implementation and use of these case definitions. Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is defined by the World Health Organization as a disease of the heart muscle characterized by dilatation and impaired contraction of the left ventricle or both ventricles. It might be idiopathic, familial/genetic, viral, and/or immune, alcoholic/toxic, or associated with recognized cardiovascular disease in which the degree of myocardial dysfunction is not explained by the abnormal loading conditions or the extent of ischemic damage. Histology is nonspecific. Presentation is usually with heart failure, which is often progressive. Arrhythmias, thromboembolism, and sudden death are common and can occur at any stage. Despite full cardiac workup, the etiology of DCM often cannot be determined. Because other viruses are known to cause DCM, the occurrence of DCM after smallpox vaccination is plausible, although not previously described. Because histologic findings of DCM are often nonspecific, endomyocardial biopsy is not likely to confirm an etiologic role for vaccinia but might rule out other known etiologies of DCM (e.g., sarcoidosis and amyloidosis). The following case definition describes the structural and functional cardiac criteria and clinical conditions required to define a case of DCM for use in the smallpox adverse events monitoring and response activity.\n\n【43】 # Case definition for dilated cardiomyopathy after smallpox vaccination\nSmallpox vacinees are defined as having DCM if they meof the following criteria:\n- cardiac muscle dysfunction exists, characterized by ventricular dilatation (e.g., left ventricular enddiastolic dimension >55 mm) and impaired contraction of one or both ventricles (e.\nPostvaccinial central nervous system disease is an inflammation of the parenchyma of the central nervous system after smallpox vaccination. When the inflammation occurs in the brain it is called \"encephalitis,\" and when it occurs in the spinal cord it is called \"myelitis.\" Confirmation of diagnosis is made only on the basis of the demonstration of central nervous system (CNS) inflammation by histopathology or neuroimaging, but might be suggested by clinical features.*\n\n【44】 # Case definition for encephalitis\nA suspected case of encephalitis is defined as the presence of the acute onset of\n- encephalopathy (e.g., depressed or altered level of consciousness, lethargy, or personality change lasting >24 hours) - clinical evidence suggestive of cerebral inflammation to include one of the following:\n-fever (temperature >100°F ) or hypothermia (temperature 5 white blood cells/mm , -presence of focal neurologic deficit, -electroencephalography findings consistent with encephalitis, -neuroimaging findings on magnetic resonance imaging consistent with acute inflammation (with or without meninges) or demyelination of the nervous system, or -seizures (either new onset or exacerbation of previously controlled seizures); and - no alternative (investigated) etiologies are found for presenting sign and symptoms. A probable case of encephalitis is defined by the acute onset of - encephalopathy as outlined for a suspected case, and - two or more of the criterion listed for suspected encephalitis as clinical evidence suggestive of cerebral inflammation, and - no alternative (investigated) etiologies are found for presenting sign and symptoms. A confirmed case of encephalitis is defined as - demonstration of acute cerebral inflammation (with or without meninges) or demyelination by histopathology and - no alternative (investigated) etiologies are found for presenting sign and symptoms.\n\n【45】 # Case definition for acute myelitis\nA suspected case of myelitis is defined as presence of the acute onset of - myelopathy  or demyelination of the spinal cord, and - no alternative (investigated) etiologies are found for presenting sign and symptoms. A probable case of myelitis is defined by the acute onset of - myelopathy as outlined for a suspected case, and - two or more of the criterion listed for suspected myelitis as evidence suggestive of spinal cord inflammation, and - no alternative (investigated) etiologies are found for presenting sign and symptoms. A confirmed case of myelitis is defined by - demonstration of acute spinal cord inflammation (with or without meninges) or demyelination by histopathology, and - no alternative (investigated) etiologies are found for presenting sign and symptoms.\nNote: Cases fulfilling the criteria for both encephalitis and myelitis in any category would be classified as encephalomyelitis.\n\n【46】 # BOX 9. Surveillance case definition for postvaccinial central nervous system disease after smallpox vaccination for use in smallpox vaccine adverse event monitoring and response\n- Some cases of postvaccinial encephalomyelitis might be caused by direct infection of the CNS by vaccinia virus, resulting in acute cytotoxic neuronal damage and inflammation. However, laboratory evidence of virus replication is lacking in the majority of cases and might be attributo immunopathological mechanisms instead. In the majority of cases, histopathologic findings similar to other \"postinfectious\" encephalitides are found, suggestive of an inflammatory demyelinating condition (acute disseminated encephalitis/encephalomyelitis ). The distinction between these two pathologic mechanisms might be difficult to make clinically in the early stages of illness. A diagnosis of ADEM might be favored by a longer interval of onset after vaccination; magnetic resonance imaging findings of multifocal areas of increased signal on T2, fluid attenuation inversion recovery, and diffusion weighted imaging sequences, suggestive of acute demyelination; and an absence of CSF pleocytosis.\n\n【47】 # The Vaccinia Case Definition Development Working Group\nContinuing Nursing Education (CNE). This activity for 1.9 contact hours is provided by CDC, which is accredited as a provider of continuing education in nursing by the American Nurses Credentialing Center's Commission on Accreditation.\n\n【48】 # Goal and Objectives\nThis MMWR provides surveillance guidelines for adverse reactions after smallpox vaccination. The case definitions and classifications were developed by CDC, in conjunction with staff of the Department of Defense, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices-Armed Forces Epidemiological Board Smallpox Vaccine Safety Working Group, and smallpox subject-matter experts. The goal of this report is to provide the case definitions used to classify reported adverse events after smallpox vaccination during the 2003 Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) smallpox vaccination program. Upon completion of this educational activity, the reader should be able to  identify the known adverse reactions to smallpox vaccination and be familiar with their case definitions,  recognize the importance of reporting adverse events after smallpox vaccination,  describe those adverse reactions after smallpox vaccination that require laboratory confirmatory testing for vaccinia, and  describe when and how to report all adverse events after vaccination.\nTo receive continuing education credit, please answer all of the following questions.\n\n【49】 # Normal vaccination reactions are often confused with…\nA. superinfection of the vaccination site.

It is not possible to reliably predict which patients with DVT will develop PTS.\n\n【1】 # Specific risk factors for PTS:\n- Recurrent ipsilateral DVT: Increases risk of PTS by 6-fold (by damaging already compromised venous valves or aggravating venous outflow obstruction). - Extent of initial DVT: Risk of PTS is 2-4 fold higher after proximal (especially iliofemoral) versus distal (calf) DVT. - Higher body mass index: Increases risk of PTS.\n- Quality of oral anticoagulation: PTS risk increases if the initial anticoagulation is inadequate (e.g. subtherapeutic INR >50% time during first three months of treatment) but risk is not affected by the intensity or duration of long-term anticoagulation. - Residual thrombosis on ultrasound: Modest (odds ratio of  increased risk of PTS.\n- Persistent elevation of D-dimer: Elevated levels of D-dimer in the weeks to months after DVT may be a modest risk factor for PTS. - DVT in pregnancy: Increases the risk of PTS.\nAge, sex, inherited thrombophilia and whether the DVT was unprovoked or secondary (due to surgery, trauma or cancer) do not appear to influence the likelihood of PTS. Furthermore, as compared with vitamin K antagonist treatment, treatment with low molecular weight heparin and direct oral anticoagulants was shown to be associated with a lower risk of PTS but these results need to be confirmed.\nA clinical prediction model, the SOX-PTS score, was recently developed to identify patients at increased risk of developing PTS. High-risk predictors were index DVT affecting the iliac vein, body mass index ≥35 kg/m 2 , and moderate-severe Villalta score severity category at the time of DVT diagnosis. Compared with patients with a score of 0, those with a score of ≥4 had an odds ratio of 5.9 for developing PTS. External validation of the score will be required before it can be put into clinical use.\n\n【2】 # PREVENTION OF PTS (TABLE : Primary and secondary prevention of DVT\nThe best way to prevent PTS is to prevent DVT. As ipsilateral DVT recurrence is a strong risk factor for PTS, preventing recurrent DVT by providing therapeutic and adequate duration of anticoagulation for the initial DVT is important.\n\n【3】 # Thrombolysis\n- Although anticoagulant therapy is the mainstay of treatment for DVT , thrombolysis may be considered for those at high risk of developing PTS. Currently, selection of patients for these thrombolytic techniques is done on a case-by-case basis, and is typically reserved for select patients with extensive (e.g. iliofemoral) thrombosis, onset of symptoms less than 14 days, low risk of bleeding, and long life expectancy. - Thrombolytic therapy in conjunction with heparin to treat acute DVT leads to higher rates of vein patency and better preservation of valve function than the use of heparin alone. - Catheter-directed thrombolysis, which involves infusion of thrombolytic therapy through a catheter inserted directly into the affected vein, is considered to have a lower bleeding risk than systemic thrombolysis; however, this intervention is still associated with an increased risk of major bleeding compared to anticoagulant therapy. - Pharmacomechanical catheter-directed thrombolysis (PCDT) involves infusion of thrombolytic therapy through a catheter inserted directly into the affected vein, along with catheter-based devices that can break up clots. - Three contemporary randomized trials of PCDT did not demonstrate a reduction in the overall frequency of PTS in otherwise unselected patients with proximal DVT or in those with iliofemoral DVT compared to anticoagulant therapy. In one study, PTS severity was reduced and, hence, venous disease quality of life appeared better in patients with iliofemoral DVT who received lytic therapy compared to those randomized to standard care. However, in the second randomized trial, lytic therapy did not significantly affect quality of life; both the generic as well as disease-specific patient-reported health-related quality of life scores showed a similar improvement in both groups during follow-up. However, long term-follow-up data showed that benefit of thrombolytic therapy became more apparent and significant with time. Longer follow-up (>2 years) is needed to appropriately assess efficacy of thrombolysis.\n\n【4】 # Elastic Compression Stockings (ECS)\n- There are conflicting RCT data on the long-term effectiveness of ECS.\n- Two previous small open label trials reported that ECS were effective in preventing PTS, but a more recent large, multicenter, placebo-controlled trial showed no evidence of benefit of active compression stocking used for two years to prevent PTS. Thus, routine use of ECS for two years to prevent PTS in DVT patients is no longer recommended. - A recent multicenter trial showed that if one decides to prescribe ECS to prevent PTS, individualized duration of therapy based on post-thrombotic symptoms/signs is non-inferior to standard duration of therapy of 24 months. - In patients with significant DVT-related swelling, ECS should be tried to relieve symptoms and used for as long as the patient finds them to be effective. - If stockings are used, knee-length and thigh-length ECS have similar physiologic effects; kneelength are easier to apply, more comforand less costly.\n\n【5】 # TREATMENT OF PTS:\nThere are few treatment options for symptomatic PTS .\n- Regular daily use of good-quality ECS as well as exercise may reduce leg swelling and discomfort. - Exercise training program was reported to improve patients' QOL and PTS symptoms.\n- Intermittent pneumatic compression sleeve units can help severe, intracPTS symptoms or severe edema; however they are cumbersome and expensive. - The por, battery-powered Venowave intermittent compression device benefits some patients with moderate to severe PTS. - There is no evidence that diuretics or \"venoactive\" drugs are effective for PTS-related edema or other manifestations. - Post-thrombotic venous ulcers are treated with compression therapy, leg elevation and topical dressings but can be refractory to therapy and tend to recur. Consultation with a dermatologist or wound clinic is often helpful. - Surgical or endovascular treatments for PTS such as venous valve repair, venous bypass and venous stents have only been evaluated in small patient series at single, specialized centers and appear to be of limited value. The ongoing NIH/NHLBI-funded Chronic Venous Thrombosis: Relief With Adjunctive Catheter-Directed Therapy (C-TRACT Trial) will determine if the use of image-guided, endovascular therapy is effective to reduce PTS disease severity and improve quality of life in patients with disabling iliac-obstructive PTS (NCT. \n\n【6】 # SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS:\n\n【7】 # Pediatrics\n- The incidence of PTS is reported to be as high as 15% in children with DVT.\n- There are no pediatric studies evaluating safety and efficacy of therapy for PTS.\n- Symptomatic management of PTS in children may follow adult guidelines.\n- Pediatricians with expertise in thromboembolism should manage, where possible, pediatric patients with DVT.

The number of surgical procedures performed in the United States continues to rise, and surgical patients are initially seen with increasingly complex comorbidities. It is estimated that approximately half of SSIs are deemed prevenusing evidence-based strategies. OBJECTIVE To provide new and updated evidence-based recommendations for the prevention of SSI. EVIDENCE REVIEW A targeted systematic review of the literature was conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library from 1998 through April 2014. A modified Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to assess the quality of evidence and the strength of the resulting recommendation and to provide explicit links between them. Of 5759 titles and abstracts screened, 896 underwent full-text review by 2 independent reviewers. After exclusions, 170 studies were extracted into evidence s, appraised, and synthesized. FINDINGS Before surgery, patients should shower or bathe (full body) with soap (antimicrobial or nonantimicrobial) or an antiseptic agent on at least the night before the operative day. Antimicrobial prophylaxis should be administered only when indicated based on published clinical practice guidelines and timed such that a bactericidal concentration of the agents is established in the serum and tissues when the incision is made. In cesarean section procedures, antimicrobial prophylaxis should be administered before skin incision. Skin preparation in the operating room should be performed using an alcohol-based agent unless contraindicated. For clean and clean-contaminated procedures, additional prophylactic antimicrobial agent doses should not be administered after the surgical incision is closed in the operating room, even in the presence of a drain. Topical antimicrobial agents should not be applied to the surgical incision. During surgery, glycemic control should be implemented using blood glucose target levels less than 200 mg/dL, and normothermia should be maintained in all patients. Increased fraction of inspired oxygen should be administered during surgery and after extubation in the immediate postoperative period for patients with normal pulmonary function undergoing general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation. Transfusion of blood products should not be withheld from surgical patients as a means to prevent SSI.This guideline is intended to provide new and updated evidence-based recommendations for the prevention of SSI and should be incorporated into comprehensive surgical quality improvement programs to improve patient safety.# S\nurgical site infections (SSIs) are infections of the incision or organ or space that occur after surgery. 1 Surgical patients initially seen with more complex comorbidities 2 and the emergence of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens increase the cost and challenge of treating SSIs.  The prevention of SSI is increasingly important as the number of surgical procedures performed in the United States continues to rise. 6,7 Public reporting of process, outcome, and other quality improvement measures is now required, 8,9 and reimbursements 10 for treating SSIs are being reduced or denied. It has been estimated that approximately half of SSIs are prevenby application of evidence-based strategies. 11\n\n【1】 # Methods\n be found in e of the Supplement.\n Comments were aggregated and reviewed with the writing group and at another HICPAC meeting. Based on the comments received, the literature search was updated, and new data were incorporated into a revised draft. Further input was provided by HICPAC during a public teleconference in May 2015. Final HICPAC input was provided via a vote by majority rule in July 2015. After final HICPAC input, CDC updated the draft document and obtained final CDC clearance and coauthor approval.\n\n【2】 # Recommendation Categories\nRecommendations were categorized using the following standard system that reflects the level of supporting evidence or regulations: - Category IA: A strong recommendation supported by high to moderate-quality evidence suggesting net clinical benefits or harms. - Category IB: A strong recommendation supported by low-quality evidence suggesting net clinical benefits or harms or an accepted practice (eg, aseptic technique) supported by low to very low-quality evidence. - Category IC: A strong recommendation required by state or federal regulation. - Category II: A weak recommendation supported by any quality evidence suggesting a trade-off between clinical benefits and harms. - No recommendation/unresolved issue: An issue for which there is low to very low-quality evidence with uncertain trade-offs between the benefits and harms or no published evidence on outcomes deemed critical to weighing the risks and benefits of a given intervention.\n\n【3】 # Recommendations\nCore In 2006, approximately 80 million surgical procedures were performed in the United States at inpatient hospitals (46 million) 7 and ambulatory hospital-affiliated or freestanding (32 million) settings. 6 Between 2006 and 2009, SSIs complicated approximately 1.9% of surgical procedures in the United States. 19 However, the number of SSIs is likely to be underestimated given that approximately 50% of SSIs become evident after discharge. 20 Estimated mean attribucosts of SSIs range from $10 443 in 2005 US dollars to $25 546 in 2002 US dollars per infection. 11 Costs can exceed $90 000 per infection when the SSI involves a prosthetic joint implant 21,22 or an antimicrobial-resistant organism. 23 The Core of this guideline (e of the Supplement) includes recommendations for the prevention of SSI that are generalizable across surgical procedures, with some exceptions as mentioned below.\nParenteral 9B. The search did not identify randomized controlled trials that evaluated soaking prosthetic devices in antiseptic solutions before implantation for the prevention of SSI. (No recommendation/ unresolved issue.)\n10. Randomized controlled trial evidence was insufficient to evaluate the trade-offs between the benefits and harms of repeat application of antiseptic agents to the patient's skin immediately before closing the surgical incision for the prevention of SSI. (No recommendation/unresolved issue.)\n\n【4】 # Prosthetic Joint Arthroplasty Prevention efforts should targsurgical procedures but especially those in which the human and financial burden is greatest.\nIn 2011, primary total knee arthroplasty accounted for more than half of the 1.2 million prosthetic joint arthroplasty procedures (primary and revision) performed in the United States, followed by total hip arthroplasty and hip hemiarthroplasty. 24 Primary shoulder, elbow, and ankle arthroplasties are much less common. By 2030, prosthetic joint arthroplasties are projected to increase to 3.8 million procedures per year.  Infection is the most common indication for revision in total knee arthroplasty 28 and the third most common indication in total hip arthroplasty. 28 By 2030, the infection risk for hip and knee arthroplasty is expected to increase from 2.18% 22 to 6.5% and 6.8%, respectively. 25 In addition, owing to increasing risk and the number of individuals undergoing prosthetic joint arthroplasty procedures, the total number of hip and knee prosthetic joint infections is projected to increase to 221 500 cases per year by 2030, at a cost of more than $1.62 billion. 22,25 The Prosthetic Joint Arthroplasty section contains recommendations that are applicable to these procedures (e of the Supplement).\n\n【5】 # Blood Transfusion\n11A (No recommendation/unresolved issue (No recommendation/ unresolved issue.) 14. For prosthetic joint arthroplasty patients receiving systemic corticosteroid or other immunosuppressive therapy, recommendation 1E applies: in clean and clean-contaminated procedures, do not administer additional antimicrobial prophylaxis doses after thesurgical incision is closed in the operating room, even in the presence of a drain. (Category IA-strong recommendation; highquality evidence.)\nIntra-articular Corticosteroid Injection 15 and 16 (No recommendation/ unresolved issue 20D. The search did not identify studies evaluating biofilm control agents, such as biofilm dispersants, quorum sensing inhibitors, or novel antimicrobial agents, for the prevention of biofilm formation or SSI in prosthetic joint arthroplasty. (No recommendation/ unresolved issue.)\n\n【6】 # Conclusions\n can be used as a resource for professional societies or organizations to develop more detailed implementation guidance or to identify future research priorities. The paucity of robust evidence across the entire guideline created challenges in formulating recommendations for the prevention of SSI. Nonetheless, the thoroughness and transparency achieved using a systematic review and the GRADE approach to address clinical questions of interest to stakeholders are critical to the validity of the clinical recommendations.\nThe number of unresolved issues in this guideline reveals substantial gaps that warrant future research. A select list of these unresolved issues may be prioritized to formulate a research agenda to advance the field. Adequately powered, well-designed studies that assess the effect of specific interventions on the incidence of SSI are needed to address these evidence gaps. Subsequent revisions to this guideline will be guided by new research and technological advancements for preventing SSIs. management, analysis, and interpretation of the data; and preparation, review, and approval for submission of the manuscript for publication.

The supplementary material is inclusive and recommended for anyone with a thirst for the evidence supporting these recommendations. Unfortunately, in many cases the authors make no recommendation with respect to support or harm if the level of the evidence was low or very low or if they were unable to judge trade-offs between harms and benefits of the proposed intervention because of lack of outcomes. The authors ultimately provide 42 statements, including 8 Category 1A, 4 Category 1B, 5 Category II, and 25 areas for which they made no recommendation or considered the area unresolved. The fact that most statements were unresolved, especially regarding prosthetic joint surgery, shows our investigators where we should be putting forth our efforts in clinical trials. There is a lot of opportunity to learn how we can provide more effective care to our patients.\nThe 12 Category 1A and Category 1B recommendations are based on moderate or high-quality evidence, and we should be using these recommendations in our practice. These key areas include (but are not limited to) the use of antimicrobial prophylaxis to achieve bactericidal concentrations in serum and tissues, including before cesarean section, and are limited to during the operation. Furthermore, we should not be using antibiotics because the patient has a drain, whether or not a prosthetic joint is in place. These recommendations are likely to be the most difficult to operationalize because some surgeons and practices have had difficulty confining antibiotic use to just 24 hours after a clean or clean-contaminated procedure, let alone when a drain is in place. Glycemic control should be achieved in all patients, with a glucose target less than 200 mg/dL. Normothermia should be maintained, and a higher fraction of inspired oxygen should be used in patients with normal Related article page 784", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Although the clinical relevance of this finding is unknown, it is possible that concomitant administration of telithromycin with drugs that are substrates of OATP family members could result in increased plasma concentrations of the co-administered drug.\n\n【3】 ## In vivo interactions\nStudies were performed to evaluate the effect of CYP 3A4 inhibitors on telithromycin and the effect of telithromycin on drugs that are substrates of CYP 3A4 and CYP 2D6. In addition, drug interaction studies were conducted with several other concomitantly prescribed drugs.\n\n【4】 ### CYP 3A4 inhibitors\nA multiple-dose interaction study with itraconazole showed that Cmax of telithromycin was increased by 22% and AUC by 54%.\nA multiple-dose interaction study with ketoconazole showed that Cmax of telithromycin was increased by 51% and AUC by 95%.\nWhen telithromycin was given with 240 mL of grapefruit juice after an overnight fast to healthy subjects, the pharmacokinetics of telithromycin were not affected.\n\n【5】 ### CYP 3A4 substrates\nSteady-state peak plasma concentrations of cisapride (an agent with the potential to increase QT interval) were increased by 95% when co-administered with repeated doses of telithromycin, resulting in significant increases in QTc. (\nWhen simvastatin was co-administered with telithromycin, there was a 5.3-fold increase in simvastatin Cmax, an 8.9-fold increase in simvastatin AUC, a 15-fold increase in the simvastatin active metabolite Cmax, and a 12-fold increase in the simvastatin active metabolite AUC. (\nIn another study, when simvastatin and telithromycin were administered 12 hours apart, there was a 3.4-fold increase in simvastatin Cmax, a 4.0-fold increase in simvastatin AUC, a 3.2-fold increase in the active metabolite Cmax, and a 4.3-fold increase in the active metabolite AUC. (\nConcomitant administration of telithromycin with intravenous or oral midazolam resulted in 2- and 6-fold increases, respectively, in the AUC of midazolam due to inhibition of CYP 3A4-dependent metabolism of midazolam. (\n\n【6】 ### CYP 2D6 substrates\nThere was no pharmacokinetic effect on paroxetine when telithromycin was co-administered.\nWhen metoprolol was co-administered with telithromycin, there was an increase of approximately 38% on the Cmax and AUC of metoprolol, however, there was no effect on the elimination half-life of metoprolol. Telithromycin exposure is not modified with concomitant single-dose administration of metoprolol. (\n\n【7】 ### Other drug interactions\nThe plasma peak and trough levels of digoxin were increased by 73% and 21%, respectively, in healthy volunteers when co-administered with telithromycin. However, trough plasma concentrations of digoxin (when equilibrium between plasma and tissue concentrations has been achieved) ranged from 0.74 to 2.17 ng/mL. There were no significant changes in ECG parameters and no signs of digoxin toxicity. (\nWhen theophylline was co-administered with repeated doses of telithromycin, there was an increase of approximately 16% and 17% on the steady-state Cmax and AUC of theophylline. Co-administration of theophylline may worsen gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea and vomiting, especially in female patients. It is recommended that telithromycin should be taken with theophylline 1 hour apart to decrease the likelihood of gastrointestinal side effects.\nTelithromycin has been shown to decrease the Cmax and AUC of sotalol by 34% and 20%, respectively, due to decreased absorption.\nWhen co-administered with telithromycin in healthy subjects, there were no pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic effects on racemic warfarin.\nWhen oral contraceptives containing ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel were co-administered with telithromycin, the steady-state AUC of ethinyl estradiol did not change and the steady-state AUC of levonorgestrel was increased by 50%. The pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic study showed that telithromycin did not interfere with the antiovulatory effect of oral contraceptives containing ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel.\nThere was no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interaction of ranitidine or antacids containing aluminum and magnesium hydroxide on telithromycin.\nDuring concomitant administration of rifampin and KETEK in repeated doses, Cmax and AUC of telithromycin were decreased by 79%, and 86%, respectively.

The concentration of drug necessary to effect viral replication by 50 percent (EC ranged from 3.7 to 5.8 μM (1 μM = 0.28 mcg/mL) and 0.07 to 1.0 μM against HIV-1IIIB and HIV-1BaL, respectively, and was 0.26 ± 0.18 μM against 8 clinical isolates. The EC50 values of abacavir against different HIV-1 clades (A-G) ranged from 0.0015 to 1.05 μM, and against HIV-2 isolates, from 0.024 to 0.49 μM. Ribavirin (50 μM) had no effect on the anti–HIV-1 activity of abacavir in cell culture.\nLamivudine: The antiviral activity of lamivudine against HIV-1 was assessed in a number of cell lines (including monocytes and fresh human peripheral blood lymphocytes) using standard susceptibility assays. EC50 values were in the range of 0.003 to 15 μM (1 μM = 0.23 mcg/mL). HIV-1 from therapy-naive subjects with no amino acid substitutions associated with resistance gave median EC50 values of 0.429 µM (range: 0.200 to 2.007 µM) from Virco (n = 92 baseline samples from COLA and 2.35 µM (1.37 to 3.68 µM) from Monogram Biosciences (n = 135 baseline samples from ESS. The EC50 values of lamivudine against different HIV-1 clades (A-G) ranged from 0.001 to 0.120 µM, and against HIV-2 isolates from 0.003 to 0.120 μM in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Ribavirin (50 μM) decreased the anti–HIV-1 activity of lamivudine by 3.5 fold in MT-4 cells.\nThe combination of abacavir and lamivudine has demonstrated antiviral activity in cell culture against non-subtype B isolates and HIV-2 isolates with equivalent antiviral activity as for subtype B isolates. Abacavir/lamivudine had additive to synergistic activity in cell culture in combination with the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) emtricitabine, stavudine, tenofovir, zalcitabine, zidovudine; the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) delavirdine, efavirenz, nevirapine; the protease inhibitors (PIs) amprenavir, indinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir; or the fusion inhibitor, enfuvirtide. Ribavirin, used in combination with interferon for the treatment of HCV infection, decreased the anti-HIV-1 potency of abacavir/lamivudine reproducibly by 2- to 6-fold in cell culture.\n\n【3】 ## Resistance\n been obtained from subjects failing abacavir/lamivudine-containing regimens. Genotypic characterization of abacavir/lamivudine-resistant viruses selected in cell culture identified amino acid substitutions M184V/I, K65R, L74V, and Y115F in HIV-1 RT.\nGenotypic analysis of isolates selected in cell culture and recovered from abacavir-treated subjects demonstrated that amino acid substitutions K65R, L74V, Y115F, and M184V/I in HIV-1 RT contributed to abacavir resistance. Genotypic analysis of isolates selected in cell culture and recovered from lamivudine-treated subjects showed that the resistance was due to a specific amino acid substitution in HIV-1 RT at codon 184 changing the methionine to either isoleucine or valine (M184V/I). In a trial of therapy-naive adults receiving ZIAGEN 600 mg once daily (n =  or 300 mg twice daily (n =  in a background regimen of lamivudine 300 mg and efavirenz 600 mg once daily (CNA, the incidence of virologic failure at 48 weeks was similar between the 2 groups (11% in both arms). Genotypic (n =  and phenotypic analyses (n =  of virologic failure isolates from this trial showed that the RT substitutions that emerged during abacavir/lamivudine once-daily and twice-daily therapy were K65R, L74V, Y115F, and M184V/I. The abacavir- and lamivudine-associated resistance substitution M184V/I was the most commonly observed substitution in virologic failure isolates from subjects receiving abacavir/lamivudine once daily (56%, 10/ and twice daily (40%, 8/.\nThirty-nine percent (7/ of the isolates from subjects who experienced virologic failure in the abacavir once-daily arm had a >2.5-fold decrease in abacavir susceptibility with a median-fold decrease of 1.3 (range: 0.5 to  compared with 29% (5/ of the failure isolates in the twice-daily arm with a median-fold decrease of 0.92 (range: 0.7 to . Fifty-six percent (10/ of the virologic failure isolates in the once-daily abacavir group compared with 41% (7/ of the failure isolates in the twice-daily abacavir group had a >2.5-fold decrease in lamivudine susceptibility with median-fold changes of 81 (range 0.79 to > and 1.1 (range 0.68 to > in the once-daily and twice-daily abacavir arms, respectively.\n\n【4】 ## Cross-Resistance\nCross-resistance has been observed among NRTIs. Viruses containing abacavir and lamivudine resistance-associated amino acid substitutions, namely, K65R, L74V, M184V, and Y115F, exhibit cross-resistance to didanosine, emtricitabine, lamivudine, tenofovir, and zalcitabine in cell culture and in subjects. The K65R substitution can confer resistance to abacavir, didanosine, emtricitabine, lamivudine, stavudine, tenofovir, and zalcitabine; the L74V substitution can confer resistance to abacavir, didanosine, and zalcitabine; and the M184V substitution can confer resistance to abacavir, didanosine, emtricitabine, lamivudine, and zalcitabine.\nThe combination of abacavir/lamivudine has demonstrated decreased susceptibility to viruses with the substitutions K65R with or without the M184V/I substitution, viruses with L74V plus the M184V/I substitution, and viruses with thymidine analog mutations (TAMs: M41L, D67N, K70R, L210W, T215Y/F, K219 E/R/H/Q/N) plus M184V.

Drugs predominantly metabolized by the CYP450 2D6 isozyme include the following drug classes: tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, beta-blockers, antiarrhythmics class 1C (e.g., flecainide and propafenone) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors Type B. Coadministration of terbinafine ts should be done with careful monitoring and may require a reduction in dose of the 2D6-metabolized drug. In a study to assess the effects of terbinafine on desipramine in healthy volunteers characterized as normal metabolizers, the administration of terbinafine resulted in a 2-fold increase in Cmax and a 5-fold increase in area under the curve (AUC). In this study, these effects were shown to persist at the last observation at 4 weeks after discontinuation of terbinafine ts. In studies in healthy subjects characterized as extensive metabolizers of dextromethorphan (antitussive drug and CYP2D6 probe substrate), terbinafine increases the dextromethorphan/dextrorphan metabolite ratio in urine by 16- to 97-fold on average. Thus, terbinafine may convert extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers to poor metabolizer status.\nIn vitro studies with human liver microsomes showed that terbinafine does not inhibit the metabolism of tolbutamide, ethinylestradiol, ethoxycoumarin, cyclosporine, cisapride and fluvastatin. In vivo drug-drug interaction studies conducted in healthy volunteer subjects showed that terbinafine does not affect the clearance of antipyrine or digoxin. Terbinafine decreases the clearance of caffeine by 19%. Terbinafine increases the clearance of cyclosporine by 15%.\nThe influence of terbinafine on the pharmacokinetics of fluconazole, cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole), zidovudine or theophylline was not considered to be clinically significant.\n lead to a substantial increase in the systemic exposure (Cmax and AUC) of terbinafine when concomitantly administered.\nThere have been spontaneous reports of increase or decrease in prothrombin times in patients concomitantly taking oral terbinafine and warfarin, however, a causal relationship between terbinafine ts and these changes has not been established.\nTerbinafine clearance is increased 100% by rifampin, a CYP450 enzyme inducer, and decreased 33% by cimetidine, a CYP450 enzyme inhibitor. Terbinafine clearance is unaffected by cyclosporine. There is no information available from adequate drug-drug interaction studies with the following classes of drugs: oral contraceptives, hormone replacement therapies, hypoglycemics, phenytoins, thiazide diuretics, and calcium channel blockers.\n7.2 Food Interactions\nAn evaluation of the effect of food on terbinafine ts was conducted.

In a more restricted sense, scientist refers to individuals who use the  scientific method.  The person may be an expert in one or more areas of science. This article focuses on the more restricted use of the word.\n\n【1】 # Etymology\nHistorically, scientists were termed \"natural philosophers\" or \"men of science\"; they were men of knowledge. Science and philosophy were roughly synonymous. William Whewell coined the term scientist in 1833 to describe an expert in the study of nature, but this term did not gain wide acceptance till the turn of the 19th century. By the twentieth century, the modern notion of science as a special brand of information about the world, practiced by a distinct group and pursued through a unique method, was essentially in place.\n\n【2】 # Description\nScience and technology have continually modified human existence. As a profession, the scientist of today is widely recognised.  Scientists include theoreticians who mainly develop new models to explain existing data, and experimentalists who mainly test models by making measurements — though in practice the division between these activities is not clear-cut, and many scientists perform both.\n been creative mathematicians. There is a continuum from the most theoretical to the most empirical scientists with no distinct boundaries. By personality, interests, training and professional activity, there is little difference between applied mathematicians and theoretical physicists.\nScientists can be motivated in several ways. Many have a desire to understand why the world is as we see it and how it came to be. They exhibit a strong curiosity about reality. Other motivations are recognition by their peers and prestige, or the desire to apply scientific knowledge for the benefit of peoples health, the nations, the world, nature or industries. Only few scientists count generating personal wealth as an important driving force behind their science.\n\n【3】 ## Scientists versus Engineers\nEngineers and scientists are often confused in the minds of the general public, with the former being closer to applied science. While scientists explore nature in order to discover general principles, engineers apply established principles drawn from mathematics and science in order to develop economical solutions to technical problems.  In short, scientists study things whereas engineers build things.  But there are plenty of instances where significant accomplishments are made in both fields by the same individual.  Scientists often perform engineering tasks in designing experimental equipment and building prototypes, and some engineers do first-rate scientific research. Mechanical, electrical, chemical and aerospace engineers are often at the forefront of scientific investigation of new phenomena and materials. Peter Debye received a degree in electrical engineering and a doctorate in physics before eventually winning a Nobel Prize in chemistry. Similarly, Paul Dirac, one of the founders of quantum mechanics, began his academic career as an electrical engineer before proceeding to mathematics and later theoretical physics. Claude Shannon, a theoretical engineer, founded modern information theory.\n\n【4】 # Historical Scientists\nAn early scientific method which emphasized experimentation was first used by the Iraqi Arab physicist and polymath Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen), circa 1021 AD, in his Book of Optics, and he has been described as the \"first scientist\" for this reason.\n a priest.\n musicians.\nIn the late 19th century, Louis Pasteur, an organic chemist, discovered that microorganisms can cause disease. A few years earlier, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr., the American physician, poet and essayist, noted that sepsis in women following childbirth was spread by the hands of doctors and nurses, four years before Semmelweis in Europe. There are many compelling stories in medicine and biology, such as the development of ideas about the circulation of blood from Galen to Harvey. The flowering of genetics and molecular biology in the 20th century is replete with famous names. Ramón y Cajal won the Nobel Prize in 1906 for his remarkable observations in neuroanatomy.\nSome see a dichotomy between experimental sciences and purely \"observational\" sciences such as astronomy, meteorology, oceanography and seismology. But astronomers have done basic research in optics, developed charge-coupled devices, and in recent decades have sent space probes to study other planets in addition to using the Hubble Telescope to probe the origins of the Universe some 14 billion years ago. Microwave spectroscopy has now identified dozens of organic molecules in interstellar space, requiring laboratory experimentation and computer simulation to confirm the observational data and starting a new branch of chemistry. Computer modeling and numerical methods are techniques required of students in every field of quantitative science.\nThose considering science as a career often look to the frontiers. These include cosmology and biology, especially molecular biology and the human genome project. Other areas of active research include the exploration of matter at the scale of elementary particles as described by high-energy physics, and nanotechnology, which hopes to develop electronics including microscopic computers, and perhaps artificial intelligence. Although there have been remarkable discoveries with regard to brain function and neurotransmitters, the nature of the mind and human thought still remain.\n\n【5】 # Types of scientists", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Usually this variation in the conductivity is caused by a change in heart rate, autonomic tone, vagal tone, or drugs.  At a more fundamental level, the abnormality is thought to be due to changes in calcium handling in the sarcoplastic reticulum.  The following complexes, either alone or in combination, may exhibit electrical alternans due to changes in electrical conduction: the P wave, the PR interval, the QRS complex, or the RR interval.

For advice on shared decision making, follow the recommendations in NICE's guideline on shared decision making.\n\n【10】 ## Information and support at the time of diagnosis\nThe consultant neurologist should ensure that people with MS, and with their agreement their family members or carers, are offered oral and written information at the time of diagnosis. This should include, but not be limited to, information about:\nwhat MS is\ntreatments, including disease‑modifying therapies\nsymptom management\nhow support groups, local services, social services and national charities are organised and how to get in touch with them\n-nline resources\nlegal requirements such as notifying the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA; see the DVLA webpage on multiple sclerosis and driving) and legal rights including social care, employment rights and benefits. \nDiscuss with the person with MS and their family members or carers whether they have social care needs and if so refer them to social services for assessment. Ensure the needs of children of people with MS are addressed. \nOffer the person with MS a face‑to‑face follow‑up appointment with a healthcare professional with expertise in MS to take place within 6 weeks of diagnosis. \n\n【11】 ## Ongoing information and support\nExplain to people with MS that they should have a comprehensive review of their care at least once a year and what this should cover  the section on comprehensive review). Advise them to ask their healthcare professional for a review if it has not taken place. \nReview information, support and social care needs regularly. Continue to offer information and support to people with MS or their family members or carers even if this has been declined previously. \nEnsure people with MS and their family members or carers have a management plan that includes who to contact if their symptoms change significantly. \nExplain to people with MS that the possible causes of symptom changes inclu\nanother illness such as an infection\nfurther relapse\nchange of disease status (for example progression). \nTalk to people with MS and their family members or carers about the possibility that the condition might lead to cognitive problems. \nProvide ongoing information and support tailored to the person's changing needs or circumstances, for example, when planning to have children, if their MS is changing to a more progressive phase or as their MS becomes more advanced. \nExplain to carers (including young carers) about their right to a carer's assessment and tell them about other sources of information and support that may be available  NICE's guideline on supporting adult carers and the Young Carers  Regulations . \n\n【12】 ## Information and support for people planning to have children or who are pregnant\nAsk the person with MS soon after diagnosis and at regular intervals if they have any plans for starting or extending their family now or in the future, either through pregnancy or adoption. \nExplain to people with MS that they should discuss with their healthcare professionals if they are planning to start or extend their family or become pregnant. In particular, ensure that people taking disease-modifying treatments understand that they should tell their healthcare professionals straight away if they are trying to become pregnant or if they become pregnant. \nExplain to people with MS, and their partners if appropriate, that MS should not stop them from planning a family. Offer the opportunity to talk with a healthcare professional with knowledge of MS to answer any questions they have. For example, this may include discussing the following:\nthat fertility is not affected by MS\nthat pregnancy can be well managed in people with MS\nthe risk of the child developing MS\ntaking vitamin D and folic acid supplements before and during pregnancy  NICE's guidelines on vitamin D and maternal and child nutrition)\npossible changes to medicine use before and during pregnancy\nthat pregnancy does not increase the risk of disease progression\nthat relapses may decrease during pregnancy and may increase 3 to 6 months after childbirth before returning to pre-pregnancy rates\nthat birth options and pain relief choices available (including epidurals) should not be affected by MS\nthat breastfeeding is safe unless the person with MS is taking certain disease-modifying treatments\nsupport that may be available with caring for and supporting children. \nDiscuss caring for a child and the possible impact of MS symptoms, such as fatigue, and how these could be managed. \n\n【13】 ## Information and support for people as MS becomes more advanced, including those approaching the end of their life\nGive people with MS that is becoming more advanced and their family members or carers information and support covering:\nsocial isolation and feelings of depression\nmobility aids and home adaptations\n-ther support available, such as legal rights including social care, employment rights and benefits, and the right to a carer's assessment  recommendation 1.2.. \nExplain to people with advanced MS and their family members or carers about the services available (for example, occupational therapy, palliative care and social services) and give them support to access them if needed. \nFor advice on identifying people who may be approaching the end of their life and providing information and support, follow the recommendations in NICE's guideline on end of life care for adults. \nWhen appropriate, explain to the person with MS (and their family members or carers if the person wishes) about advance care planning and power of attorney. Think about discussing advance care planning early if you expect the person's ability to communicate, cognitive status or mental capacity will deteriorate. Follow the recommendations on advance care planning in NICE's guideline on decision making and mental capacity. \nFor a short explanation of why the committee made the 2022 recommendations and how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on providing information and support .\nFull details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review A: information and support for patients, their families and carers.\n\n【14】 # Coordination of care\nFor general advice on continuity of care and relationships follow the recommendations in NICE's guideline on patient experience in adult NHS services.\nOffer the person with MS an appropriate single point of contact with knowledge of MS services to coordinate care and help them access services. \nCare for people with MS using a coordinated multidisciplinary approach. Involve professionals who can best meet the needs of the person with MS and who have expertise in managing MS including:\nMS nurses\nconsultant neurologists\nphysiotherapists with expertise in MS and occupational therapists\nspeech and language therapists, psychologists, dietitians, social care, continence specialists and specialist neuropharmacists or specialist MS pharmacists\nconsultants in rehabilitation medicine\nprimary healthcare team. \nFor a short explanation of why the committee made the 2022 recommendation and how it might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on coordination of care .\nFull details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review B: coordination of care.\n\n【15】 # Modifiable risk factors for relapse or progression of MS\n\n【16】 ## Exercise\nEncourage people with MS to exercise. Advise them that regular exercise may have beneficial effects on their MS and does not have any harmful effects on their MS. \n\n【17】 ## Smoking\nAdvise people with MS not to smoke and explain that it will increase the progression of disability. ( \n\n【18】 ## Vaccinations\nOffer vaccinations in line with advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccinations and Immunisation and the Green Book: Immunisation against infectious disease for people with MS and their carers. \n\n【19】 # MS symptom management and rehabilitation\nThe guideline does not make recommendations for all symptoms that occur in people with MS. Some symptoms are addressed in other NICE guidelines and these are referenced where relevant.\nDetermine how often the person with MS will need to be seen based on:\ntheir needs, and those of their family and carers and\nthe frequency of visits needed for different types of treatment (such as review of disease‑modifying therapies, rehabilitation and symptom management). \nWhen prescribing medicines for symptom management in people with MS, ensure that local arrangements for prescribing, supply and treatment review follow NICE's guideline on medicines optimisation. \n\n【20】 ## Fatigue\nAsk people with MS if they are experiencing fatigue, sudden tiredness or a change in their energy levels affecting their daily living. \nDo not assume that the person's fatigue is always caused by MS. Assess for other causes and manage these or refer the person for management if indicated. Other causes of fatigue may inclu\nsleep problems\nsymptoms of MS, such as pain, spasticity and bladder dysfunction\nside effects of medicines\nillnesses, such as infections, anaemia and thyroid dysfunction\nanxiety and depression  NICE's guidelines on generalised anxiety disorder and panic disorder in adults and depression in adults with a chronic physical health problem). \nExplain that MS‑related fatigue may be brought on by heat or biological, physical and emotional stress. \nOffer people with MS and fatigue a personalised discussion about how they can be supported to self-manage their fatigue. This could inclu\nidentifying goals and priorities\nadvice on conserving their energy\nreviewing lifestyle factors such as diet and exercise\nusing stress management and wellbeing approaches such as mindfulness and cognitive behavioural techniques to help with day-to-day activities. \nAdvise people that aerobic, resistive and balance exercises, including yoga and pilates, may be helpful in treating MS‑related fatigue. \nExplain to people that there is no evidence that a specific diet will improve fatigue in people with MS, but that a healthy diet will benefit their general health. \nFor people with MS with moderately impaired mobility (an EDSS  score of greater than or equal to , consider a combination of:\na programme of supervised aerobic and moderate progressive resistance activity and\ncognitive behavioural techniques. \nDo not use vitamin B12 injections to treat fatigue in people with MS. \nDo not offer hyperbaric oxygen to treat fatigue in people with MS. \n the section on non-pharmacological management of mobility problems and fatigue.\nFor a short explanation of why the committee made the 2022 recommendations and how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on assessment and non-pharmacological management of fatigue .\nFull details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review C: non-pharmacological management of fatigue.\n\n【21】 Discuss with the person with MS whether a medicine to treat fatigue might be an option for them. Explain that there are potential risks, benefits and safety concerns for the possible treatment options. \nIf a person with MS wishes to try a medicine for fatigue, refer them to a specialist to fully discuss the treatment options. \nUse shared decision making to decide whether to try a medicine for fatigue and which would be most sui Taking into account the needs, priorities and preferences of the person with MS, and the risks and benefits of each treatment, consider any of the following:\namantadine:\nsee the BNF for amantadine dosages\nmodafinil, except in people who are pregnant or planning pregnancy:\nsee the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) safety advice on modafinil for advice on monitoring and cautions for use, including cardiovascular monitoring before and during treatment\nfollow the MHRA safety advice on modafinil and pregnancy for people who are able to get pregnant, including explaining the risks, advising on effective contraception and explaining that modafinil may reduce the effectiveness of steroidal contraceptives\nuse the lowest effective dose\nselective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI):\nuse the lowest dose recommended for licensed indications\n NICE's information on prescribing medicines.\nRegularly review treatment to monitor effectiveness, safety and acceptability, adjust the dose, and decide whether to continue or stop the medicine:\nAgree the frequency of review with the person with MS, taking into account the medicine that they are taking, the need for dose adjustments and the person's preferences and circumstances.\nFor more information, see the section on medication review in NICE's guideline on medicines optimisation and, for reviewing SSRIs, see the section on reviewing medicines in NICE's guideline on medicines associated with dependence or withdrawal symptoms. \nWhen the person with MS is on a sdose of a medicine for fatigue, subsequent prescriptions may be issued by another prescriber as part of a shared-care agreement under the direction of the initiating specialist prescriber. For more information about shared care, see NHS England's guidance on responsibility for prescribing between primary and secondary/tertiary care. \nFor a short explanation of why the committee made these recommendations and how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on pharmacological management of fatigue .\nFull details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review D: pharmacological management of fatigue.\n\n【22】 ## Mobility problems\n recommendation 1.4.1 for advice on encouraging exercise in people with MS.\nFor guidance on functional electrical stimulation for drop foot, see the NICE interventional procedures guidance on functional electrical stimulation for drop foot of central neurological origin.\nEnsure people with MS and mobility problems have access to an assessment to establish individual goals and discuss ways to achieve them. This would usually involve rehabilitation specialists and physiotherapists with expertise in MS. \nDo not offer fampridine to treat mobility problems in people with MS. Fampridine is a clinically effective treatment for some people, but it is not cost effective at the current list price. This recommendation does not apply to people who have already started treatment with fampridine in the NHS, who should be able to continue treatment until they and their NHS clinician think it appropriate to stop.\nFor a short explanation of why the committee made this recommendation and how it might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on pharmacological management of mobility problems .\nFull details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review E: pharmacological management of mobility.\n\n【23】 Consider vestibular rehabilitation for people with MS who have fatigue or mobility problems associated with limited standing balance. \nConsider supervised exercise programmes involving moderate progressive resistance training and aerobic exercise to treat people with MS who have mobility problems or fatigue. \nHelp the person with MS continue to exercise, for example, by referring them to a physiotherapist with expertise in MS or to exercise referral schemes. \nIf more than 1 of the interventions recommended for mobility or fatigue are sui, offer treatment based on which the person prefers and whether they can continue the activity after the treatment programme ends. \nEncourage people with MS to keep exercising after treatment programmes end for longer-term benefits  NICE's guideline on behaviour change: individual approaches). \n\n【24】 ## Spasticity\nSuspect spasticity when a person with MS presents with any of the following:\ninvoluntary muscle movements (spasms)\nmuscle stiffness\npain and restriction with certain movements or positions causing difficulty in performing various activities\na change in their mobility or upper limb function. \nAssess people with MS and suspected spasticity for factors that might worsen spasticity, for example, pressure ulcers, bladder and bowel dysfunction and infections, poor posture or positioning, and pain. Provide support and information to help people with MS, and their families and carers if appropriate, to prevent and manage these factors. \nDiscuss with the person the balance between the benefits and harms of treating spasticity. In particular, explain that some people use their spasticity to maintain their posture and ability to stand, walk or transfer, and that treatment with muscle relaxants may adversely affect this. \nConsider oral baclofen as a first-line drug treatment to treat spasticity in people with MS who have specific treatment goals such as improving mobility or easing pain and discomfort. Take into account any contraindications, comorbidities and the person's preferences. \n the 2019 MHRA drug safety update on pregabalin, gabapentin and risk of abuse and dependence.\nWhen using oral baclofen or gabapentin to treat spasticity in people with MS, explain to the person that they should:\nincrease the dose gradually in at least 2‑week increments to optimise symptom improvement or until they reach the maximum dose they can tolerate\nstop taking the medicine if there is no benefit at the maximum tolerated dose (explain that baclofen can cause harm if stopped suddenly and that special precautions may be needed when stopping specific medicines)\n the BNF and the summary of product characteristics for baclofen and gabapentin for advice on optimising dosage and stopping treatment and, if relevant, treating people with renal impairment and older people. For more information on reviewing and withdrawing gabapentin, see NICE's guideline on medicines associated with dependence or withdrawal symptoms.\nConsider a combination of oral baclofen and gabapentin for people with MS if:\nindividual medicines do not provide adequate relief or\n the 2019 MHRA drug safety update on pregabalin, gabapentin and risk of abuse and dependence.\nIf spasticity is causing significant impairments in mobility, posture or function and initial treatments are unsuccessful, refer to a multidisciplinary team experienced in the management of spasticity for assessment and treatment planning. \nFor guidance on THC:CBD spray for treating spasticity in people with MS, see the recommendations on spasticity in NICE's guideline on cannabis-based medicinal products. \nFor a short explanation of why the committee made these recommendations and how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on spasticity .\nFull details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review F: pharmacological management of spasticity.\n\n【25】 ## Oscillopsia\n NICE's information on prescribing medicines and the 2019 MHRA drug safety update on pregabalin, gabapentin and risk of abuse and dependence.\n NICE's information on prescribing medicines.\nRefer the person with MS for specialist advice if there is no improvement in oscillopsia after treatment with gabapentin and memantine or if side effects prevent continued use. \n\n【26】 ## Emotional lability\n NICE's information on prescribing medicines.\n\n【27】 ## Pain\nAssess and investigate the cause of pain to establish a diagnosis and offer treatment specific to the cause of the pain. \n NICE's guideline on depression in adults with a chronic physical health problem. \nTreat neuropathic pain in people with MS and refer people to pain services according to NICE's guideline on neuropathic pain in adults. \nBe aware that musculoskeletal pain is common in people with MS and is usually secondary to problems with immobility, spasticity and posture. Assess musculoskeletal pain and offer treatment appropriate to the cause, for example see the sections on managing mobility problems and spasticity, and NICE's guideline on low back pain and sciatica in over 16s. \nFor a short explanation of why the committee made these recommendations and how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on pain .\nFull details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review G: non-pharmacological management of pain.\n\n【28】 ## Cognitive and memory problems\nBe aware that the symptoms of MS can include cognitive problems, including memory problems, that the person may not immediately recognise or associate with their MS. \nAssess cognition as part of the person's comprehensive review. Tailor the assessment to the person's needs, for example, use a clinic interview or brief formal assessment, or consider referral for a full neuropsychological assessment if needed. \nBe aware that anxiety, depression, difficulty sleeping, fatigue and medication can affect cognition. Assess for and offer management appropriate for these issues in people with MS and cognitive or memory problems (for example, see the section on fatigue and NICE's guidelines on generalised anxiety disorder and panic disorder in adults and depression in adults with a chronic physical health problem). \nConsider referring people with MS and persisting cognitive impairments to an occupational therapist and/or a neuropsychologist to assess and manage these symptoms according to the person's needs. \nFor a short explanation of why the committee made these recommendations and how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on cognitive and memory problems .\nFull details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review H: non-pharmacological management of memory and cognitive problems.\n\n【29】 ## Ataxia and tremor\nThe evidence was reviewed for the pharmacological management of ataxia and tremor, and the committee made a recommendation for research.\nFor a short explanation of why the committee only made a recommendation for research, see the rationale section on pharmacological management of ataxia and tremor .\nFull details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review I: pharmacological management of ataxia and tremor.\n\n【30】 ## Dystonia and tremor\nFor guidance on deep brain stimulation for tremor and dystonia, see the NICE interventional procedures guidance on deep brain stimulation for tremor and dystonia (excluding Parkinson's disease).\n\n【31】 # Comprehensive review\nEnsure all people with MS have a comprehensive review of all aspects of their care at least once a year. \nEnsure the comprehensive review is carried out by healthcare professionals with expertise in MS and its complications. Involve different healthcare professionals with expertise in specific areas of the review if needed. \nTailor the comprehensive review to the needs of the person with MS assessing:\nMS symptoms:\nmobility and balance including falls\nneed for mobility aids including wheelchair assessment\nuse of arms and hands\nmuscle spasms and stiffness\ntremor\nbladder, bowel and sexual function  NICE's guidelines on urinary incontinence in neurological disease and faecal incontinence in adults)\nsensory symptoms and pain\nspeech and swallowing  NICE's guideline on nutrition support for adults)\nvision\ncognitive symptoms\nfatigue\ndepression and anxiety  NICE's guidelines on depression in adults with a chronic physical health problem and generalised anxiety disorder and panic disorder in adults)\nsleep\nrespiratory function.\nMS disease course:\nevidence of progression\nevidence of active disease\nrelapses in past year\neligibility for disease-modifying treatments  the section on other treatments)\nthe nature and extent of disability (which should be documented).\nGeneral health:\nweight\nsmoking, alcohol and recreational drugs\nexercise\naccess to routine health screening and contraception\ncare of other chronic conditions.\nSocial activity and participation:\nfamily and social circumstances\ndriving and access to transport\nemployment (for example, the need for vocational support or rehabilitation)\naccess to daily activities and leisure.\nCare and carers:\npersonal care needs\nsocial care needs\naccess to adaptations and equipment at home. \nRefer any issues identified during the comprehensive review of the person with MS to members of the MS multidisciplinary team and other appropriate teams so that they can be managed. \nEnsure people with MS are offered a medicines review in line with NICE's guidelines on medicines adherence and medicines optimisation. \nEnsure people with MS have their bone health regularly assessed and reviewed in line with NICE's guideline on osteoporosis. \nEnsure people with MS and severely reduced mobility are regularly assessed and reviewed for risk of contractures (shortening of tendons, muscles or ligaments that limits joint movement). \nCheck people with MS and severely reduced mobility at every contact for areas at risk of pressure ulcers  NICE's guideline on pressure ulcers). \nDiscuss the care provided by carers and care workers as part of the person's care plan. Ensure that carers (including young carers) know about their right to a carer's assessment  NICE's guideline on supporting adult carers for recommendations on identifying, assessing and meeting the caring, physical and mental health needs of families and carers and the Young Carers  Regulations . \nRefer people with MS to palliative care services for symptom control and for end of life care when appropriate. \n\n【32】 # Relapse and exacerbation\n\n【33】 ## Recognising a relapse\nDiagnose a relapse of MS if the person:\ndevelops new symptoms or\nhas worsening of existing symptomsand these last for more than 24 hours in the absence of infection or any other cause after a speriod of at least 1 month. \nBefore diagnosing a relapse of MS:\nrule out infection – particularly urinary tract and respiratory infections and\ndiscriminate between the relapse and fluctuations in disease or progression. \nDo not routinely diagnose a relapse of MS if symptoms are present for more than 3 months. \n\n【34】 ## Treating acute relapse of MS\nDevelop local guidance and pathways for timely treatment of relapses of MS. Ensure follow up is included in the guidance and pathway. \nAssess and offer treatment for relapses of MS that affect the person's ability to perform their usual tasks, as early as possible and within 14 days of onset of symptoms. \nNon‑specialists should discuss a person's diagnosis of relapse and whether to offer steroids with a healthcare professional with expertise in MS because not all relapses need treating with steroids. \nOffer treatment for relapse of MS with oral methylprednisolone 0.5 g daily for 5 days. \nConsider intravenous methylprednisolone 1 g daily for 3 to 5 days as an alternative for people with MS:\nin whom oral steroids have failed or not been tolerated or\nwho need admitting to hospital for a severe relapse or monitoring of medical or psychological conditions such as diabetes or depression. \nDo not prescribe steroids at lower doses than methylprednisolone 0.5 g daily for 5 days to treat an acute relapse of MS. \nDo not give people with MS a supply of steroids to self‑administer at home for future relapses. \n\n【35】 ## Information about treating a relapse with steroids\nDiscuss the benefits and risks of steroids with the person with MS, taking into account the effect of the relapse on the person's ability to perform their usual tasks and their wellbeing. \nExplain the potential complications of high‑dose steroids, for example temporary effects on mental health (such as insomnia, depression, confusion and agitation) and worsening of blood glucose control in people with diabetes. \nGive the person with MS and their family members or carers (as appropriate) information that they can take away about side effects of high‑dose steroids in a format that is appropriate for them. \nEnsure that the MS multidisciplinary team is told that the person is having a relapse, because relapse frequency may influence which disease-modifying therapies are chosen and whether they need to be changed. \n\n【36】 ## Medical, therapy and social care needs at time of relapse or exacerbation\nIdentify whether the person having a relapse of MS or their family members or carers have social care needs and if so refer them to social services for assessment. \nOffer inpatient treatment to the person having a relapse of MS if their relapse is severe or if it is difficult to meet their medical and social care needs at home. \nExplain that a relapse of MS may have short‑term effects on cognitive function. \nIdentify whether the person with MS having a relapse or exacerbation needs additional symptom management, rehabilitation or consideration for disease-modifying treatments. \n\n【37】 # Other treatments\n\n【38】 ## Disease-modifying treatments\nNICE has published technology appraisal guidance on disease-modifying treatments for MS. For full details, see NICE's technology appraisal guidance on multiple sclerosis.\n\n【39】 ## Vitamin D\nDo not offer vitamin D solely for the purpose of treating MS. \n\n【40】 ## Omega fatty acids compounds\nDo not offer omega‑3 or omega‑6 fatty acid compounds to treat MS. Explain that there is no evidence that they affect relapse frequency or progression of MS. \n\n【41】 # Terms used in this guideline\nThis section defines terms that have been used in a particular way for this guideline.\n\n【42】 ## Advanced MS\nMS is described as 'advanced' when it has progressed to the point where a person is severely affected by their symptoms and has significant ongoing physical or cognitive impairment (this typically happens in the late stages of primary and secondary progressive MS). People with advanced MS are unable to carry out most of their usual activities of daily living independently and need other people to assist them. The term is used to describe the level of burden rather than the type or duration of the MS.# Recommendations for research\nThe guideline committee has made the following recommendations for research.\n\n【43】 # Key recommendations for research\n\n【44】 ## Coordination of care\nWhat is the clinical and cost effectiveness of processes of care, including the role of multiple sclerosis (MS) specialist nurses and other healthcare professionals, to improve care coordination and health outcomes in adults with MS?

\nFor a short explanation of why the committee made the recommendation for research, see the rationale section on pharmacological management of ataxia and tremor .\nFull details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review I: pharmacological management of ataxia and tremor.\n# Rationale and impact\nThese sections briefly explain why the committee made the recommendations and how they might affect practice.\n\n【57】 # Diagnosing multiple sclerosis\nRecommendations 1.1.1 to 1.1.9\n\n【58】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThe recommendations were updated to reflect changes to the McDonald criteria, revised 2017 , which are expected to speed up diagnosis and reduce the chance of misdiagnosis. The committee agreed that the previous recommendations on diagnosis are still relevant, but made some updates based on their experience and changes to practice since 2014.\nThe committee retained the recommendations on symptoms and features of multiple sclerosis (MS), highlighting that symptoms can be wide-ranging and listing the most common symptoms and those that would make a diagnosis unlikely.\nThe committee agreed that assessments to exclude alternative diagnoses need to be tailored to the person, according to their presenting symptoms. They decided that a list of blood tests would not be helpful and that tests would need to be decided on an individual basis.\nThe committee agreed that a consultant neurologist should be responsible for the diagnosis of MS, using the history, examination, MRI and other test findings, and by following the revised McDonald criteria. To meet the updated criteria, dissemination of lesions in the nervous system in space and time needs to be demonstrated, and all lesions visible on an MRI scan can contribute to the criteria, irrespective of whether they have caused symptoms (symptomatic lesions) or have not caused symptoms (asymptomatic lesions). A positive finding of cerebrospinal fluid oligoclonal bands can now be used in place of dissemination of lesions in some circumstances. The criteria have been developed for people experiencing clinically isolated syndrome, which means that they must present with symptoms suggestive of an inflammatory demyelinating condition.\nThe committee agreed to retain the previous recommendation on reviewing people with suspected MS who do not meet the McDonald criteria, but added the example of reviewing people annually, which is in line with current practice. They agreed that information should be provided so that people understand why they need to be reviewed regularly and who to contact if their symptoms change or they have concerns.\nThe committee supported the importance of providing information and advice on resources at the time of diagnosis.\n\n【59】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\nThe recommendations are expected to help to reduce variation between services and clinicians. The recommendations reflect current clinical practice and are not expected to increase the number of referrals or the cost of making a diagnosis and therefore will not have a substantial resource impact.\nReturn to recommendations\n\n【60】 # Providing information and support\nRecommendations 1.2.4 and 1.2.9 to 1.2.18\n\n【61】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThe committee noted that people who were diagnosed with MS a long time ago may not be offered an annual review.  They highlighted the importance of informing people with MS and their carers that they should have a regular comprehensive review so that they can ensure that this takes place at least once a year and covers all of their needs.\nThe evidence showed that MS has a significant impact on carers and that information and support for them was often lacking. Carers are not always aware of the support available to them and often do not have the information they need as circumstances change for the person with MS. The committee agreed that carers should be aware of their right to a carer's assessment and highlighted that this should include assessments for young carers.\n noted that the timing of information was important and agreed that information and support should be provided according to the changing needs or circumstances of the person with MS. Considering pregnancy and approaching more advanced disease were identified as particular situations in which information and support needs should be reviewed. The committee made specific recommendations for these groups.\nNo evidence was identified on the information and support needs for people diagnosed with clinically isolated syndrome, and the committee therefore made a recommendation for research on information and support for people with clinically isolated syndrome.\nRecommendations from the previous version of the guideline were updated and new recommendations added, based on qualitative evidence and the committee's experience. The committee agreed that the recommendations should apply to both women and men planning to start a family, where appropriate, and to people considering adoption as well as those planning pregnancy.\nThe committee agreed that discussions about starting or extending a family should happen early to ensure that people with MS have time to make decisions and plan for the future. They agreed that healthcare professionals should proactively ask about and discuss the person's plans for having children. The committee noted that some people with MS assume that they cannot have children and do not ask for advice. Although there was limited evidence supporting early information giving, the committee agreed that, based on their experience, it is important to start these discussions soon after diagnosis.\nThe committee noted that some disease-modifying treatments should not be taken during pregnancy because of the risk of harm to the unborn baby. Therefore, they highlighted that people taking these treatments need to inform their healthcare professional straight away if they are trying to get pregnant or become pregnant.\nThe evidence showed that people with MS often have concerns about the impact of MS on having a family. The committee agreed that MS should not be a barrier to planning a family, because pregnancies can be well managed and additional support may be available. Many people with MS may feel like they are not able to have children, so the committee agreed that people with MS should be able to discuss the possibilities before making these decisions.\n apply to people with MS.\n identified where better information and support could improve the experience and wellbeing of people with MS and their carers, including legal rights, employment rights, benefits and carer assessments.\nBased on the evidence and their experience, the committee agreed that people with advanced MS and their carers need information and support to navigate services so that they can access extra support as their needs change.\n\n【62】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\nThe recommendations are in line with current good practice. Overall, the committee did not think these recommendations would have a significant resource impact.\nReturn to recommendations\n\n【63】 # Coordination of care\nRecommendation 1.3.1\n\n【64】 ## Why the committee made the recommendation\nThe committee updated the 2014 recommendation to emphasise that the point of contact should have knowledge of MS services to coordinate the person's care and help them access relevant healthcare professionals. The available clinical and health economic evidence was limited, so the committee were not able to specify that the point of contact should have knowledge of MS because this may represent a change in practice and a significant resource impact. Instead, a point of contact with access to appropriate healthcare services was specified to allow for different service configurations; for example, the point of contact would be able to access a healthcare professional who can contact the person with MS and respond to their concerns. The committee acknowledged the lack of evidence in this area and made a recommendation for research on coordination of care for people with MS to support future guidance in this area.\n\n【65】 ## How the recommendation might affect practice\nThe recommendation emphasises that the point of contact should have knowledge of MS services. This should not result in a large change in practice and therefore will not have a significant resource impact.\nReturn to recommendation\n\n【66】 # Assessment and non-pharmacological management of fatigue\nRecommendations 1.5.3 to 1.5.9 and 1.5.11\n\n【67】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nAlthough a large number of studies have been published since the previous version of the guideline, the committee agreed that the new evidence was too limited in quality to change most of the existing recommendations. However, the new evidence did further support the 2014 recommendations on managing MS-related fatigue.\nFatigue may not always be identified and treated, so the committee agreed by informal consensus that people with MS should be asked about the presence of fatigue. Causes of fatigue other than MS may sometimes be missed, so the committee highlighted the importance of checking for other possible causes, to ensure appropriate management.\nThere was some evidence that fatigue or energy management interventions and wellbeing techniques, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and mindfulness, are beneficial. However, the committee agreed that the evidence was not sufficient to recommend formal programmes because of limitations in the studies. Instead, the committee recognised that using elements of these approaches could be helpful and included in discussions about self-management options.\nBased on their experience, the committee agreed that a fatigue management discussion should be offered, which is routinely provided in current practice. This would be a tailored discussion that could include goals and priorities for each person, advice on energy conservation, review of lifestyle factors and the use of stress reduction and wellbeing techniques, including cognitive behavioural principles for managing day-to-day activities and mindfulness-based techniques.\nThe committee agreed that the previous recommendation on advice about the possible benefits of aerobic, balance and stretching exercises, including yoga, was still supported by the evidence. In addition, there was some evidence of benefit for progressive resistive exercises and pilates.\n included in the discussion of fatigue management.\nThe committee agreed that the evidence still supported the previous recommendation on considering a programme of aerobic and moderate progressive resistance activity combined with cognitive behavioural techniques to treat fatigue in people with significantly impaired mobility (EDSS  score of at least . This was based on clinical evidence, modest economic evidence (covering the ExIMS study,  and the original economic analysis from the previous version of the guideline supporting the cost effectiveness of combined exercise programmes. The committee noted that this should be a supervised programme provided to the person with MS, rather than self-directed exercise, and that it should be tailored to the needs and abilities of the person.\nNo randomised controlled trial evidence was identified for hyperbaric oxygen to treat MS-related fatigue in people with MS. The committee were concerned that this intervention is being used despite the lack of evidence, sometimes at the expense of the person with MS or through charities. They agreed that it should not be used, based on the lack of evidence, their clinical experience and the high cost involved.\nA recommendation for research on identifying clinically and cost-effective interventions for the non-pharmacological management of fatigue was developed to encourage further research in this area.\n\n【68】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\nThe recommendations on assessment and offering people a personal tailored discussion about fatigue management do not represent a change in practice. Discussion of fatigue management is provided routinely in current practice by occupational therapists, MS nurses or physiotherapists. It does not typically involve a specific, structured fatigue management programme but includes some elements of fatigue management, such as advice on energy conservation. Similarly, the inclusion of stress and wellbeing techniques does not refer to structured interventions but allows the opportunity to use some elements of these techniques as part of the fatigue management discussion, which the committee agreed are used as part of fatigue management discussions in current practice.\nSupervised aerobic and moderate progressive resistance programmes with cognitive behavioural techniques for people with an EDSS score of at least 4 was recommended in the 2014 guideline based on clinical- and cost-effectiveness analysis. Physiotherapists and occupational therapists typically apply CBT principles like goal setting as part of exercise interventions in current practice, and this does not need to be a formal CBT intervention delivered by a psychologist. The committee agreed that this would not represent a change in practice.\nRecommendations covering advice on exercises for MS-related fatigue (which would be self-directed exercise rather than supervised programmes provided to the person with MS) and following the principles of a healthy diet are consistent with current good practice, as is the recommendation not to offer hyperbaric oxygen.\nAs none of the recommendations represent a change in current practice these recommendations are not expected to have a resource impact.\nReturn to recommendations\n\n【69】 # Pharmacological management of fatigue\nRecommendations 1.5.12 and 1.5.16\n\n【70】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThe evidence for treating fatigue with amantadine, modafinil or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in people with MS was limited but showed some benefit for each medicine. The lack of good evidence comparing the different treatments meant that the committee were unable to recommend one in preference to the others or an order in which these treatments should be considered. However, they agreed that fatigue can have a significant impact on the person's daily activities and that, in their clinical experience, it can improve with pharmacological treatment in some people.\nAmantadine, modafinil and SSRIs are not licensed for treating fatigue in people with MS and there are safety issues associated with their use, so they should only be started by a specialist in MS. The committee agreed that the potential benefits of effective treatment may outweigh the risks for people whose quality of life is severely affected by fatigue. However, they highlighted that people with MS should be fully informed about the possible risks and benefits, and make a shared decision with a specialist about whether to try a medicine and which would be most sui, taking into account their needs, priorities and preferences. They agreed that it is important that people can access pharmacological treatment options and that they can be considered before trying non-pharmacological treatments in people for whom a rapid response is a priority.\nThe committee highlighted the particular safety concerns for modafinil, including that it should not be used by people who are pregnant or planning pregnancy, and that precautions should be taken if prescribing it for people able to get pregnant, in line with the 2020 Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) safety advice on modafinil. The committee noted additional advice for modafinil on monitoring, stopping treatment and cautions for use in the 2014 MHRA safety advice on modafinil and advice in the summary of product characteristics for modafinil and amantadine. Based on their experience, the committee highlighted the importance of starting people on a low dose of modafinil, such as 100 mg once a day.\nThe committee agreed that people taking these medicines would need to have regular reviews to monitor effectiveness and safety, adjust dosages and ensure that treatment is stopped if it is ineffective or the person experiences adverse effects. If treatment is effective and the person is on a sdose of their medicine, the committee agreed that responsibility for prescribing could be transferred to primary care under a shared-care arrangement.\nA recommendation for research on the pharmacological management of fatigue was made to support future research in this area.\n\n【71】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\n be an increase in the use of shared-care arrangements for prescribing these medicines in primary care.\nThere may be a resource impact due to cardiovascular monitoring from the increased use of modafinil in a broader range of clinical settings, including primary care. However, the recommendations may result in a decrease in the use of amantadine, which has a greater unit cost than modafinil and SSRIs. Therefore, the overall resource impact of the recommendations is unlikely to be significant.\nReturn to recommendations\n\n【72】 # Pharmacological management of mobility problems\nRecommendation 1.5.18\n\n【73】 ## Why the committee made the recommendation\nFampridine was shown to be effective in treating lack of mobility in some people with MS, but not all. A health economic analysis was carried out for this guideline update, which included modelling an initial 4‑week assessment to identify which people with MS respond to and would then continue fampridine treatment. Based on the current list price, fampridine was not found to be a cost-effective treatment and so the committee made a recommendation to not offer fampridine for the management of mobility problems.\n\n【74】 ## How the recommendation might affect practice\nThis recommendation does not represent a change in practice and therefore will not have a resource impact.\nReturn to recommendation\n\n【75】 # Spasticity\nRecommendations 1.5.24 to 1.5.32\n\n【76】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThere was very limited new evidence on pharmacological management of spasticity. Only 1 study comparing intrathecal baclofen to usual care in a post-stroke population was identified. This evidence was insufficient to make any new recommendations or significant changes to the previous guideline recommendations. Therefore, the committee updated the 2014 recommendations based on their experience and knowledge of current practice.\n highlighted that it is important to emphasise that the management of spasticity in MS should be tailored to the needs of the person and their specific treatment goals because spasticity can vary significantly in people with MS and change at different stages in the course of their disease. The committee agreed that the previous recommendation on assessing for and treating factors that may exacerbate symptomatic spasticity should be retained.\nThe committee were aware that some people with MS use their spasticity to support them in maintaining posture when transferring or standing, and they agreed that the treatment of spasticity can have the potential to cause greater levels of disability. It was, therefore, agreed that the balance of risks and harms of treatment need to be fully discussed with the person before agreeing treatment.\n a potential increased risk of respiratory depression (as advised by the MHRA) when using gabapentin in combination with other CNS depressants, and people with neurological disease (such as MS) may be at higher risk of this. The committee discussed the safety issues for gabapentin and agreed that illegal diversion and misuse are of particular concern. However, they agreed that gabapentin can be an effective treatment and should still be an option for treating spasticity in MS if oral baclofen is not tolerated or unsuccessful. Prescribers should follow the MHRA safety advice on evaluating people for a history of drug abuse and checking for misuse and dependence. The committee noted that gabapentin is now a class C controlled substance and prescribers will need to follow the statutory requirements for its use.\nBased on their experience, the committee agreed that information should be added to the previous recommendation on using these medicines to clarify the importance of gradually increasing the doses of medicine to reach the optimal dosage.\nThe committee agreed that if a person's treatment goals are not being met by treatment with baclofen or gabapentin (alone or in combination), and appropriate physical assessments and precipitating or prolonging factors have been addressed, other treatment approaches should be considered, which may be delivered by a service dedicated to the more specialist management of spasticity. The committee updated the recommendation in the 2014 guideline on referral to specialist services to include multidisciplinary teams, which is consistent with current clinical practice.\nA recommendation for research on identifying clinical and cost-effective pharmacological interventions for the management of spasticity was developed to encourage further research in this area.\n\n【77】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\nThe recommendations reflect current best practice in the approach to the assessment and management of spasticity in people with MS. The committee recognised that not all clinicians would have direct access to specialist spasticity management services to deliver treatments beyond initial pharmacological approaches. However, services that specialise in the management of spasticity should be available at a regional level, ideally as part of a network.\nIt is not anticipated that the updated recommendations will result in significantly greater resource use to support the assessment and treatment of spasticity in people with MS. There may be resource savings realised through a reduction in complications caused by inappropriate treatment or untreated spasticity.\nReturn to recommendations\n\n【78】 # Pain\nRecommendations 1.5.37 to 1.5.40\n\n【79】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThe causes of pain in people with MS are varied. It may be neuropathic, caused by MS nerve damage; or secondary to immobility, spasticity or posture issues; or it may be unrelated to MS and caused by other comorbid conditions. Pain is sometimes assumed to be neuropathic in people with MS when it may have a different cause. Based on their experience, the committee agreed that the first step in managing pain is to investigate and establish the cause. If the underlying cause is correctly identified, it will prevent unnecessary treatment and possible side effects, and ensure pain is managed correctly.\n affect the way the person deals with pain. Therefore, it is important that healthcare professionals are mindful of this complex interaction and that people are offered support and advice if pain is affecting their mental wellbeing.\nThe evidence on non-pharmacological management of pain was limited. The interventions and outcomes were varied, and the study sizes were small. There was some evidence of benefit from interventions such as yoga, relaxation massage, mindfulness, CBT and transcutaneous direct current stimulation and hypnosis with neurofeedback. However, the committee agreed that the evidence was insufficient to make any recommendations for or against particular non-pharmacological interventions. The committee therefore made a recommendation for research on non-pharmacological interventions for pain to support future research in this area.\n acknowledged that spasticity can play a major part in musculoskeletal pain. Therefore, the committee highlighted that musculoskeletal pain should be assessed and treatment offered that is appropriate to and addresses the cause of the pain.\n\n【80】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\nAssessing and investigating the cause of pain is consistent with current best practice. The committee noted that assessment can be done by many different healthcare professionals, such as a rehabilitation physician, a GP, a neurologist, a physiotherapist or an MS nurse. They discussed that this would usually just involve history taking, but for some people further investigations such as scans may be needed. Although there may be costs associated with further investigations, it was agreed that these are likely to be offset by identifying the cause of pain and offering appropriate treatment.\nAcknowledging the impact of pain on mental health would not result in a change in practice or significant resource impact.\nReturn to recommendations\n\n【81】 # Cognitive and memory problems\nRecommendations 1.5.41 to 1.5.44\n\n【82】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\n made to encourage the use of particular tests or scales for measuring different cognitive functions and improve the ability to pool and interpret data in the future.\nBased on their experience, the committee highlighted the need for cognitive symptoms to be assessed as part of the comprehensive review. This assessment is important for people with cognitive symptoms, because their cognitive profile needs to be established before decisions about any interventions can be made, based on their impairments. It was agreed that the type of cognitive assessment needed would differ depending on the person's needs. This might involve a clinical interview with or without carer input or a brief formal neuropsychological assessment. It was noted that a full neuropsychological assessment may be needed in people with a more complex presentation, for example, if fatigue and other disorders may be contributing to cognitive impairments.\nIn the absence of new evidence, the committee agreed that the previous recommendations on cognition and memory problems should be retained and updated based on their experience and agreed by informal consensus. They agreed that medication should be added to the list of factors that may affect cognition, and that appropriate management of these factors should be offered.\nThe committee agreed that the recommendation on referral for assessment and management of cognitive impairment should be updated so that referral can be to an occupational therapist, or a neuropsychologist as needed, rather than both, in line with current practice. Referral and the assessment and management of cognitive impairment should be tailored to the person's individual needs, because the cognitive profile of each person is likely to differ.\n\n【83】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\nCognitive assessment is usually available if the person has been offered a referral, although there may be some regional differences. It was noted that a simple assessment takes 10 to 15 minutes and does not need specific expertise. This type of assessment may be a change in practice for some services, but it is unlikely to have a significant resource impact. A full, longer neuropsychological assessment is a more costly assessment. However, it was noted that only a very small proportion of people are likely to need this longer assessment and future assessments are not as resource intensive as the baseline assessment. Given that only a small number of people would need this more expensive assessment (fewer than 1% of the MS population) and that it may already be current practice for some services, it was not thought to represent a significant resource impact.\n have access to a neuropsychologist.\nReturn to recommendations\n\n【84】 # Pharmacological management of ataxia and tremor\n\n【85】 ## Why the committee did not make recommendations\nThere was a lack of evidence for pharmacological management of ataxia and tremor in people with MS. Only 1 new study was identified, which compared botulinum toxin with a placebo. This study was analysed alongside a similar study included in the previous guideline, but the committee agreed that this evidence was insufficient to make recommendations for or against its use. Botulinum toxin is not generally used in current practice for ataxia and tremor, and this use is off label. A recommendation for research on the pharmacological management of ataxia and tremor was developed to support future research in this area.# Context\nMultiple sclerosis (MS) is an acquired chronic immune-mediated inflammatory condition of the central nervous system, affecting both the brain and spinal cord. It affects approximately 130,000 people in the UK. It is the most common cause of serious physical disability in adults of working age.\nPeople with MS typically develop symptoms in their late 20s, experiencing visual and sensory disturbances, limb weakness, gait problems, and bladder and bowel symptoms. They may initially have partial recovery, but over time develop progressive disability.\nThe cause of MS is unknown. It is believed that an abnormal immune response to environmental triggers in people who are genetically predisposed results in immune-mediated acute, and then chronic, inflammation. The initial phase of inflammation is followed by a phase of progressive degeneration of the affected cells in the nervous system. MS is a potentially highly disabling disorder with considerable personal, social and economic consequences. People with MS live for many years after diagnosis with a significant impact on their ability to work, as well as an adverse and often highly debilitating effect on their quality of life and that of their families.\nThis guideline updates and replaces NICE's 2014 guideline (CG. It includes updated recommendations on diagnosis, information and support, coordination of care and management of MS-related symptoms. The guideline does not cover all symptoms and problems associated with MS. Some areas are addressed in other NICE guidance, for example, urinary symptoms and swallowing, and these are referenced where appropriate. Many of the interventions used in rehabilitation to alleviate symptoms, such as non-pharmacological interventions for ataxia and tremor, interventions for weakness, cardiorespiratory fitness, sensory loss, visual problems (apart from oscillopsia), and secondary complications of immobility such as deconditioning and contractures, have not been covered because these are beyond the scope of the guideline. Many of these problems are complex and need personalised assessment and management strategies carried out by healthcare professionals with appropriate expertise in rehabilitation and MS.\nThe guideline does not cover the use of disease-modifying treatments. However, NICE has published technology appraisal guidance on these treatments  the NICE technology appraisal guidance on multiple sclerosis for more information).\n attend specialised tertiary services, often established to provide and monitor disease-modifying therapies.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

About 1 percent of the U.S. population has hyperthyroidism. Some diseases, such as Graves’ disease, thyroid nodules and thyroiditis, are associated with the cause of hyperthyroidism. Hyperthyroidism can affect your metabolism. Usual signs and symptoms include goiter, increased appetite but weight loss, palpitation, hypertension, increased sensitivity to heat and perspiration, nervousness and hand tremors. The Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH) test is a very sensitive and useful test to identify the disorder. Other examinations include the T3 and T4 test, radioactive iodine uptake test and thyroid scan. Treatment options of hyperthyroidism depends on the cause, age, physical condition and the severity of symptoms. Usual treatment measures are medications, radioactive iodine and thyroidectomy. The common side effect of radioactive iodine and thyroidectomy is hypothyroidism. The patient will need to take thyroid hormone supplement to restore normal hormone levels.\n\n【3】 ## What are the symptoms of Hyperthyroidism?\nSymptoms of hyperthyroidism vary from person to person. Usual signs include the following:\n- Goiter\n- Increased appetite, but weight loss\n- Palpitation\n- Hypertension\n- Increased sensitivity to heat and perspiration\n- Nervousness, anxiety or irritability, difficulty sleeping\n- Hand tremors\n- Fatigue, muscle weakness\n- Changes in menstrual patterns (usually lighter flow, less frequent periods) in women\n cause these symptoms. Only a doctor can tell for sure. A person with any of these symptoms should tell the doctor so that the problems can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible.\n\n【4】 ## Who is at highest risk?\n- Graves’ disease\n- Thyroid nodules\n- Thyroiditis\n- Too much iodine ingestion\n- Over-medicating with synthetic thyroid hormone\n\n【5】 ## Diagnosis\n- Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH) test: This is a very sensitive and useful test and usually used as the first test to identify the disorder. The TSH test is based on the feedback between TSH and thyroid hormone. Patients with hyperthyroidism may show a lower reading than normal people.\n- T3 and T4 test: This test may show the levels of T3 and T4 in your blood. In patients with hyperthyroidism, the levels of one or both of these hormones in your blood will be higher than normal.\n- Thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI) test: This test may help diagnose Graves' disease, which has this kind of antibody.\n- Radioactive iodine uptake test: This test can detect the iodine uptake function of your thyroid gland and help diagnose the cause of hyperthyroidism. For example, low levels of iodine uptake might be a sign of thyroiditis, whereas high levels could indicate Graves’ disease.\n help diagnose the cause of hyperthyroidism by providing images of nodules and other possible thyroid irregularities.\nOther diseases with similar symptoms:\n- Autonomic nerve dysfunction\n- Coronary artery disease\n- Goiter\n- Schizophrenia\n- Thyroid cancer\n\n【6】 ## When to seek urgent medical care?\nCall your health care provider if symptoms of hyperthyroidism develop. If you experience either of the following symptoms, seeking urgent medical care as soon as possible:\n- Palpitation\n- Severe hypertension\n\n【7】 ## Treatment options\nUsual treatment measures of hyperthyroidism include medications, radioactive iodine, and surgery. Treatment options depends on the cause, age, physical condition and the severity of symptoms.\n- Medications: Antithyroid medications, such as methimazole (Tapazole) and propylthiouracil (PTU), are used to block the production of thyroid hormone. Symptoms may begin to improve in 6 to 12 weeks and the whole treatment period may last for at least a year. Beta blockers, for example propranolol, may be used to relieve symptoms such as palpitation, nervousness,hypertension, sweating and shaking.\n- Radioactive iodine: This kind of treatment may destroy the thyroid gland and stop the excess production of hormones. During this period, the patient takes radioactive iodine by mouth. A common side effect is permanent hypothyroidism, which needs thyroid supplements.\n- Surgery: Thyroidectomy is another type of treatment option. The possible side effect after surgery is hypothyroidism. Patients need to take thyroid hormone supplements to restore normal hormone levels.\n\n【8】 ## Contraindicated medications\nPatients diagnosed with hyperthyroidism should avoid using the following medications:\n- Levothyroxine\n- PhentermineIf you have been diagnosed with hyperthyroidism, consult your physician before starting or stopping any of these medications.\n\n【9】 ## Where to find medical care for Hyperthyroidism?\nDirections to Hospitals Treating Hyperthyroidism\n\n【10】 ## Prevention\n- For hyperthyroidism caused by too much iodine ingestion, the method of prevention is decreasing iodine ingestion and a regular check of thyroid hormone levels in the blood.\n- For hyperthyroidism caused by over-medicating with synthetic thyroid hormone, giving the appropriate dose to patients and a regular check of thyroid hormone levels in the blood may be important.\n\n【11】 ## What to expect (Outlook/Prognosis)?\nMany cases of hyperthyroidism are generally trea Prognosis depends on whether or not the patient has severe complications.\n\n【12】 ## Possible Complications\n\n【13】 #", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

In most cases, these events could be treated symptomatically.\nDepression of any severity was reported in 26% of subjects who received 9 mcg INFERGEN monotherapy and was the most common adverse reaction resulting in study drug discontinuation.\nINFERGEN 15 mcg three times a week monotherapy as subsequent treatment was associated with a greater incidence of leukopenia and granulocytopenia. One or more dose reductions for any causes were required in up to 36% of subjects.\n\n【3】 ## Combination Treatment with INFERGEN/Ribavirin Clinical Trials\nThe most common adverse reactions in the combination treatment with INFERGEN/ribavirin trial are listed in  and included fatigue (76%), nausea (45%), flu-like symptoms (40%), headache (42%), arthralgia (31%), and myalgia (29%), neutropenia (40%), leukopenia (29%), insomnia (39%), and depression (26%).\nAdverse reactions led to early study discontinuation in 104 (21%) of subjects; more subjects discontinued from the 15 mcg INFERGEN group (64 versus . Fatigue, anemia, and depression were the most common adverse reactions resulting in study drug discontinuation. A higher proportion of subjects who received the recommended starting dose of 15 mcg (52%) than the 9 mcg dose group (40%) required INFERGEN dose modifications due to adverse reactions, primarily due to neutropenia/leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and fatigue/weakness. A total of 14% of subjects experienced serious adverse reactions, the most common of which were neutropenia (2%), suicidal ideation (1%), and hyperuricemia (1%).\n\n【4】 ### Laboratory Values\nHemoglobin and Hematocr\nIn the combination INFERGEN/ribavirin trial, 88% of subjects had decreases in hemoglobin levels of ≥2 g/dL from baseline. Of these, 27% had hemoglobin levels decrease to ≤10 g/dL, and underwent dose reductions of ribavirin. Anemia or hemolytic anemia led to study drug discontinuation in 10 subjects.\nWhite Blood Cells: INFERGEN treatment is associated with decreases in mean values for both total white blood cell (WBC) count and ANC. By the end of initial monotherapy treatment, mean decreases from baseline of 19% for WBCs and 23% for ANC were observed. These effects reversed during the post treatment observation period. In two INFERGEN-monotherapy treated subjects ANC levels decreased to below 500 × 106 cells/L. In both cases, the ANC values returned to clinically acceplevels with INFERGEN dose reductions and were not associated with infections.\nMean decreases from baseline up to 23% for WBCs and up to 27% for ANC were observed for subjects subsequently retreated with INFERGEN monotherapy. Two subjects experienced reversible reductions in ANC to less than 500 × 106 cells/L.\nIn the combination INFERGEN/ribavirin trial, leukopenia was reported in 24% and 34% of 9 mcg and 15 mcg treated subjects, respectively. More subjects treated with 15 mcg experienced lymphopenia than did those treated with 9 mcg: 14% versus 7%. ANC levels <0.75 x 109/L were observed in 21% of subjects treated with 9 mcg and 27% of those treated with 15 mcg; no subjects experienced significant infections associated with low ANC levels.\nPlatelets: INFERGEN treatment is associated with alterations in platelet count. Decreases in mean platelet count of 16% compared to baseline were seen by the end of INFERGEN monotherapy treatment. These decreases were reversed during the post treatment observation period. Three percent of subjects had platelets decrease to less than 50 × 109 cells/L, which necessitated dose reduction.\nMore subjects treated with 15 mcg in the INFERGEN/ribavirin combination trial experienced a decrease in platelet counts <40 × 109/L, 3% versus 1% in the 9 mcg dose group. None of the subjects had platelet counts <25 × 109/L. One subject in the 15 mcg group had Grade 4 thrombocytopenia 127 days after the start of treatment, was hospitalized for this event, and treatment with both study drugs was discontinued; the event resolved 8 days later.\nTriglycerides: Mean values for serum triglyceride increased shortly after the start of administration of INFERGEN monotherapy, with increases of 41%, compared with baseline, at the end of the treatment period. Seven percent of the subjects developed values which were at least 3 times above pretreatment levels during treatment. This effect was reversed after discontinuation of treatment.\nIn the INFERGEN/ribavirin combination trial, 7% of subjects in the 15 mcg dose group experienced increases in triglyceride levels over baseline levels at week 48 compared to 2% in the 9 mcg dose group. There were no differences in the proportion of subjects who had ≥Grade 3 triglyceride elevations: 2% in both dose groups.\nThyroid Function: INFERGEN monotherapy treatment was associated with biochemical changes consistent with hypothyroidism including increases in TSH and decreases in T4 mean values. Increases in TSH to greater than 7 mU/L were seen in 10% of 9 mcg INFERGEN-treated subjects either during the treatment period or the 24-week post treatment observation period. Thyroid supplements were instituted in approximately one-third of these subjects.\nIn the combination INFERGEN/Ribavirin trial, mean increases in TSH levels from baseline were greater for the 15 mcg group compared with the 9 mcg group; 14% and 3%, respectively, at Week 12 and 54% and 0% at Week 48. No serious adverse events, discontinuations or dose modifications were related to abnormalities in thyroid function.\nUric Acid: Grade 4 (>10 mg/dL) uric acid levels were commonly observed in both INFERGEN/ribavirin treatment groups: 23 in the 9 mcg and 26 in the 15 mcg group. One subject in the 9 mcg group and three in the 15 mcg group experienced serious adverse events related to elevated uric acid levels. Four subjects in the 15 mcg had INFERGEN/ribavirin temporarily interrupted due to elevated uric acid levels.\n\n【5】 ## Immunogenicity\nThe number of subjects developing positive binding antibody responses was similar in the 9 mcg INFERGEN (11%) and 3 MIU IFN α-2b groups (15%) in monotherapy studies. The titer of neutralizing antibodies to interferon was not measured. Following cessation of interferon therapy, the number of subjects with a positive antibody response declined.\nIn the INFERGEN/ribavirin combination study, approximately 13% of subjects in the 15 mcg and 18% in the 9 mcg arms developed low-titer neutralizing antibodies to INFERGEN. The clinical and pathological significance of the appearance of serum neutralizing antibodies is unknown. No apparent correlation of antibody development to clinical response was observed. The incidence of binding antibody was approximately 31%.\nThe detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies for INFERGEN with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading.\n\n【6】 ## Postmarketing Experience\nThe following adverse reactions have been identified and reported during post-approval use of INFERGEN. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily and from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate the frequency of the reaction or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.\nApplication site\ninjection site reaction, including injection site necrosis ulcer, and bruising\nEar and Labyrinth\nhearing loss, hearing impairment\nGastrointestinal\nabdominal distention, gastrointestinal bleeding, gastritis\nHepatobiliary\nhepatic enzyme elevations, including ALT and AST elevation, abnormal hepatic function, hyperbilirubinemia, jaundice, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy\nInfections\nsepsis\nMetabolism and Nutritional\ndehydration\nMusculoskeletal\nrhabdomyolysis, arthritis, bone pain\nNervous\nspeech disorder, ataxia, gait abnormal, convulsions, loss of consciousness, memory impairment, tremors, visual field defect\nPsychiatric\ndelusions, hallucinations\nSkin and Subcutaneous\nbruising, pyoderma gangrenosum, toxic epidermal necrolysis\nVascular Disorders\nHemorrhage", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

There is a Black Box Warning for this drug as shown here.  Common adverse reactions include dysgeusia, sedation, and throat irritation.\n\n【4】 # Adult Indications and Dosage\n\n【5】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Adult)\n\n【6】 # Indications\n- ADASUVE is a typical antipsychotic indicated for the acute treatment of agitation associated with schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder in adults.\n- \"Psychomotor agitation\" is defined in DSM-IV as \"excessive motor activity associated with a feeling of inner tension.\" Patients experiencing agitation often manifest behaviors that interfere with their care (e.g., threatening behaviors, escalating or urgently distressing behavior, self-exhausting behavior), leading clinicians to the use of rapidly absorbed antipsychotic medications to achieve immediate control of the agitation.\n- The efficacy of ADASUVE was established in one study of acute agitation in patients with schizophrenia and one study of acute agitation in patients with bipolar I disorder.\n\n【7】 # Limitations of Use:\n- As part of the ADASUVE REMS Program to mitigate the risk of bronchospasm, ADASUVE must be administered only in an enrolled healthcare facility.\n\n【8】 # Dosing\n- ADASUVE must be administered only by a healthcare professional. ADASUVE is administered by oral inhalation only. The recommended dose for acute agitation is 10 mg administered by oral inhalation, using a single-use inhaler. Administer only a single dose within a 24-hour period .\nRequired Examination Prior to Dosing\nPrior to administering ADASUVE, screen all patients for a history of asthma, COPD, or other pulmonary disease, and examine patients (including chest auscultation) for respiratory signs (e.g. wheezing).\n\n【9】 # DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS\n- ADASUVE is an inhalation powder supplied in a single-use, disposable inhaler containing 10 mg of loxapine base.\n\n【10】 ## Off-Label Use and Dosage (Adult)\n\n【11】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Loxapine (inhalation) in adult patients.\n\n【12】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Loxapine (inhalation) in adult patients.\n\n【13】 # Pediatric Indications and Dosage\n\n【14】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Pediatric)\nThere is limited information regarding FDA-Labeled Use of Loxapine (inhalation) in pediatric patients.\n\n【15】 ## Off-Label Use and Dosage (Pediatric)\n\n【16】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Loxapine (inhalation) in pediatric patients.\n\n【17】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Loxapine (inhalation) in pediatric patients.\n\n【18】 # Contraindications\nADASUVE is contraindicated in patients with the following:\n- Current diagnosis or history of asthma, COPD, or other lung disease associated with bronchospasm.\n- Acute respiratory symptoms or signs (e.g., wheezing).\n- Current use of medications to treat airways disease, such as asthma or COPD\n- History of bronchospasm following ADASUVE treatment\n- Known hypersensitivity to loxapine or amoxapine. Serious skin reactions have occurred with oral loxapine and amoxapine.\n\n【19】 # Warnings\nBronchospasm\n- ADASUVE can cause bronchospasm that has the potential to lead to respiratory distress and respiratory arrest . Administer ADASUVE only in an enrolled healthcare facility that has immediate access on-site to equipment and personnel trained to manage acute bronchospasm, including advanced airway management (intubation and mechanical ventilation).\n- Prior to administering ADASUVE, screen patients regarding a current diagnosis or history of asthma, COPD, and other lung disease associated with bronchospasm, acute respiratory symptoms or signs, current use of medications to treat airways disease, such as asthma or COPD; and examine patients (including chest auscultation) for respiratory abnormalities (e.g., wheezing). Monitor patients for symptoms and signs of bronchospasm (i.e., vital signs and chest auscultation) at least every 15 minutes for a minimum of one hour following treatment with ADASUVE . ADASUVE can cause sedation, which can mask the symptoms of bronchospasm.\n- Because clinical trials in patients with asthma or COPD demonstrated that the degree of bronchospasm, as indicated by changes in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV, was greater following a second dose of ADASUVE, limit ADASUVE use to a single dose within a 24 hour period.\n- Advise all patients of the risk of bronchospasm. Advise them to inform the healthcare professional if they develop any breathing problems such as wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, or cough following treatment with ADASUVE.\nADASUVE REMS to Mitigate Bronchospasm\n- Because of the risk of bronchospasm, ADASUVE is available only through a restricted program under a REMS called the ADASUVE REMS.Required components of the ADASUVE REMS are:\n- Healthcare facilities that dispense and administer ADASUVE must be enrolled and comply with the REMS requirements. Certified healthcare facilities must have on-site access to equipment and personnel trained to provide advance airway management, including intubation and mechanical ventilation.\n- Wholesalers and distributors that distribute ADASUVE must enroll in the program and distribute only to enrolled healthcare facilities.\nIncreased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis\n- Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at increased risk of death. Analyses of 17 placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drug-treated patients of 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the cases of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies can be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear. ADASUVE is not approved for the treatment of elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis.\nNeuroleptic Malignant Syndrome\n- Antipsychotic drugs can cause a potentially fatal symptom complex termed Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS). Clinical manifestations of NMS include hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmia). Associated features can include elevated serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) concentration, rhabdomyolysis, elevated serum and urine myoglobin concentration, and renal failure. NMS did not occur in the ADASUVE clinical program.\n- The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. It is important to consider the presence of other serious medical conditions (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection, heat stroke, primary CNS pathology, central anticholinergic toxicity, extrapyramidal symptoms, or drug fever).\n- The management of NMS should inclu\n- If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. The patient should be carefully monitored, since recurrences of NMS have been reported.\nHypotension and Syncope\n- ADASUVE can cause hypotension, orthostatic hypotension, and syncope. Use ADASUVE with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, or conditions that would predispose patients to hypotension (dehydration, hypovolemia, or treatment with antihypertensive medications or other drugs that affect blood pressure or reduce heart rate).\n- In the presence of severe hypotension requiring vasopressor therapy, the preferred drugs may be norepinephrine or phenylephrine. Epinephrine should not be used, because beta stimulation may worsen hypotension in the setting of ADASUVE-induced partial alpha blockade.\n- In short-term (24-hour) placebo-controlled trials of patients with agitation associated with schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder, hypotension occurred in 0.4% and 0.8% in the ADASUVE 10 mg and placebo groups, respectively. There were no cases of orthostatic hypotension, postural symptoms, presyncope or syncope. A systolic blood pressure ≤ 90 mm Hg with a decrease of ≥ 20 mm Hg occurred in 1.5% and 0.8% of the ADASUVE 10 mg and placebo groups, respectively. A diastolic blood pressure ≤ 50 mm Hg with a decrease of ≥15 mm Hg occurred in 0.8% and 0.4% of the ADASUVE 10 mg and placebo groups, respectively.\n- In 5 Phase 1 studies in normal volunteers, the incidence of hypotension was 3% and 0% in ADASUVE 10 mg and the placebo groups, respectively. The incidence of syncope or presyncope in normal volunteers was 2.3% and 0% in the ADASUVE and placebo groups, respectively. In normal volunteers, a systolic blood pressure ≤ 90 mm Hg with a decrease of ≥ 20 mm Hg occurred in 5.3% and 1.1% in the ADASUVE and placebo groups, respectively. A diastolic blood pressure ≤ 50 mm Hg with a decrease of ≥ 15 mm Hg occurred in 7.5% and 3.3% in the ADASUVE and placebo groups, respectively.\nSeizures\n- ADASUVE lowers the seizure threshold. Seizures have occurred in patients treated with oral loxapine. Seizures can occur in epileptic patients even during antiepileptic drug maintenance therapy. In short term (24 hour), placebo-controlled trials of ADASUVE, there were no reports of seizures.\nPotential for Cognitive and Motor Impairment\n- ADASUVE can impair judgment, thinking, and motor skills. In short-term, placebo-controlled trials, sedation and/or somnolence were reported in 12% and 10% in the ADASUVE and placebo groups, respectively. No patients discontinued treatment because of sedation or somnolence.\n- The potential for cognitive and motor impairment is increased when ADASUVE is administered concurrently with other CNS depressants . Caution patients about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that therapy with ADASUVE does not affect them adversely.\nCerebrovascular Reactions, Including Stroke, in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis\n- In placebo-controlled trials with atypical antipsychotics in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis, there was a higher incidence of cerebrovascular adverse reactions (stroke and transient ischemic attacks), including fatalities, compared to placebo-treated patients. ADASUVE is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis .\nAnticholinergic Reactions Including Exacerbation of Glaucoma and Urinary Retention\n- ADASUVE has anticholinergic activity, and it has the potential to cause anticholinergic adverse reactions including exacerbation of glaucoma or urinary retention. The concomitant use of other anticholinergic drugs (e.g., antiparkinson drugs) with ADASUVE could have additive effects.\n\n【20】 # Adverse Reactions\n\n【21】 ## Clinical Trials Experience\n- The following adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling:\n- Hypersensitivity (serious skin reactions)\n- Bronchospasm\n- Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis\n- Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome\n- Hypotension and syncope\n- Seizure\n- Potential for Cognitive and Motor Impairment\n- Cerebrovascular Reactions, Including Stroke, in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis\n- Anticholinergic Reactions Including Exacerbation of Glaucoma and Urinary Retention\n\n【22】 # Clinical Trials Experience\n- Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.\n- The following findings are based on pooled data from three short-term (24-hour), randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials (Studies 1, 2, and  of ADASUVE 10 mg in the treatment of patients with acute agitation associated with schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder. In the 3 trials, 259 patients received ADASUVE 10 mg, and 263 received placebo.\n- Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions: In the 3 trials in acute agitation, the most common adverse reactions were dysgeusia, sedation, and throat irritation. These reactions occurred at a rate of at least 2% of the ADASUVE group and at a rate greater than in the placebo group. (Refer to .\nAirway Adverse Reactions in the 3 Trials in Acute Agitation\n- Agitated patients with Schizophrenia or Bipolar Disorder: In the 3 short-term (24-hour), placebo-controlled trials in patients with agitation associated with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder (Studies 1, 2, and , bronchospasm (which includes reports of wheezing, shortness of breath and cough) occurred more frequently in the ADASUVE group, compared to the placebo group: 0% (0/ in the placebo group and 0.8% (2/ in the ADASUVE 10 mg group. One patient with schizophrenia, without a history of pulmonary disease, had significant bronchospasm requiring rescue treatment with a bronchodilator and oxygen.\nBronchospasm and Airway Adverse Reactions in Pulmonary Safety Trials\n- Clinical pulmonary safety trials demonstrated that ADASUVE can cause bronchospasm as measured by FEV1, and as indicated by respiratory signs and symptoms in the trials. In addition, the trials demonstrated that patients with asthma or other pulmonary diseases, such as COPD are at increased risk of bronchospasm. The effect of ADASUVE on pulmonary function was evaluated in 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical pulmonary safety trials in healthy volunteers, patients with asthma, and patients with COPD. Pulmonary function was assessed by serial FEV1 tests, and respiratory signs and symptoms were assessed. In the asthma and COPD trials, patients with respiratory symptoms or FEV1 decrease of ≥ 20% were administered rescue treatment with albuterol (metered dose inhaler or nebulizer) as required. These patients were not eligible for a second dose; however, they had continued FEV1 monitoring in the trial.\nHealthy Volunteers: In the healthy volunteer crossover trial, 30 subjects received 2 doses of either ADASUVE or placebo 8 hours apart, and 2 doses of the alternate treatment at least 4 days later. The results for maximum decrease in FEV1 are presented in  No subjects in this trial developed airway related adverse reactions (cough, wheezing, chest tightness, or dyspnea).\nAsthma Patients: In the asthma trial, 52 patients with mild-moderate persistent asthma (with FEV1 ≥ 60% of predicted) were randomized to treatment with 2 doses of ADASUVE 10 mg or placebo. The second dose was to be administered 10 hours after the first dose. Approximately 67% of these patients had a baseline FEV1 ≥ 80% of predicted. The remaining patients had an FEV1 60-80% of predicted. Nine patients (17%) were former smokers. As shown in  and , there was a marked decrease in FEV1 immediately following the first dose (maximum mean decreases in FEV1 and % predicted FEV1 were 303 mL and 9.1%, respectively). Furthermore, the effect on FEV1 was greater following the second dose (maximum mean decreases in FEV1 and % predicted FEV1 were 537 mL and 14.7 %, respectively). Respiratory-related adverse reactions (bronchospasm, chest discomfort, cough, dyspnea, throat tightness, and wheezing) occurred in 54% of ADASUVE-treated patients and 12% of placebo-treated patients. There were no serious adverse events. Nine of 26 (35%) patients in the ADASUVE group, compared to one of 26 (4%) in the placebo group, did not receive a second dose of study medication, because they had a ≥ 20% decrease in FEV1 or they developed respiratory symptoms after the first dose. Rescue medication (albuterol via metered dose inhaler or nebulizer) was administered to 54% of patients in the ADASUVE group  and 12% in the placebo group (1 patient after the first dose and 2 patients after the second dose).\nCOPD Patients: In the COPD trial, 53 patients with mild to severe COPD (with FEV1 ≥ 40% of predicted) were randomized to treatment with 2 doses of ADASUVE 10 mg or placebo. The second dose was to be administered 10 hours after the first dose. Approximately 57% of these patients had moderate COPD ; 32% had severe disease (GOLD Stage III); and 11% had mild disease (GOLD Stage I). As illustrated in  there was a decrease in FEV1 soon after the first dose (maximum mean decreases in FEV1 and % predicted FEV1 were 96 mL and 3.5%, respectively), and the effect on FEV1 was greater following the second dose (maximum mean decreases in FEV1 and % predicted FEV1 were 125 mL and 4.5%, respectively). Respiratory adverse reactions occurred more frequently in the ADASUVE group (19%) than in the placebo group (11%). There were no serious adverse events. Seven of 25 (28%) patients in the ADASUVE group and 1of 27 (4%) in the placebo group did not receive a second dose of study medication because of a ≥ 20% decrease in FEV1 or the development of respiratory symptoms after the first dose. Rescue medication (albuterol via MDI or nebulizer) was administered to 23% of patients in the ADASUVE group: 8% of patients after the first dose and 21% of patients after the second dose, and to 15% of patients in the placebo group.\n- FEV1 categories are cumulative; i.e. a subject with a maximum decrease of 21% is included in all 3 categories. Patients with a ≥ 20% decrease in FEV1 did not receive a second dose of study drug.\n- Patients with a ≥ 20% decrease in FEV1 did not receive a second dose of study drug and are not included in the curves beyond hour 10.\n occurred.\n- In the 3 short-term (24-hour), placebo-controlled trials of ADASUVE in 259 patients with agitation associated with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, extrapyramidal reactions occurred. One patient (0.4%) treated with ADASUVE developed neck dystonia and oculogyration. The incidence of akathisia was 0% and 0.4% in the placebo and ADASUVE groups, respectively.\nDystonia (Antipsychotic Class Effect: Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during treatment with ADASUVE. Dystonic symptoms include spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, difficulty swallowing or breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue.\n- Acute dystonia tends to be dose-related, but can occur at low doses, and occurs more frequently with first generation antipsychotic drugs such as ADASUVE. The risk is greater in males and younger age groups.\nCardiovascular Reactions: Tachycardia, hypotension, hypertension, orthostatic hypotension, lightheadedness, and syncope have been reported with oral administration of loxapine.\n\n【23】 ## Postmarketing Experience\nThere is limited information regarding Postmarketing Experience of Loxapine (inhalation) in the drug label.\n\n【24】 # Drug Interactions\nCNS Depressants\n- ADASUVE is a central nervous system (CNS) depressant. The concurrent use of ADASUVE with other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, opioid analgesics, benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, sedative/hypnotics, muscle relaxants, and/or illicit CNS depressants) can increase the risk of respiratory depression, hypotension, profound sedation, and syncope. Therefore, consider reducing the dose of CNS depressants if used concomitantly with ADASUVE.\nAnticholinergic Drugs\n- ADASUVE has anticholinergic activity. The concomitant use of ADASUVE and other anticholinergic drugs can increase the risk of anticholinergic adverse reactions including exacerbation of glaucoma and urinary retention.\n\n【25】 # Use in Specific Populations\n\n【26】 ### Pregnancy\nPregnancy Category (FDA):\n- Pregnancy Category\nPregnancy Category (AUS):\n- Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) Pregnancy Category\nThere is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Loxapine (inhalation) in women who are pregnant.\n\n【27】 ### Labor and Delivery\nThere is no FDA guidance on use of Loxapine (inhalation) during labor and delivery.\n\n【28】 ### Nursing Mothers\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Loxapine (inhalation) with respect to nursing mothers.\n\n【29】 ### Pediatric Use\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Loxapine (inhalation) with respect to pediatric patients.\n\n【30】 ### Geriatic Use\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Loxapine (inhalation) with respect to geriatric patients.\n\n【31】 ### Gender\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Loxapine (inhalation) with respect to specific gender populations.\n\n【32】 ### Race\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Loxapine (inhalation) with respect to specific racial populations.\n\n【33】 ### Renal Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Loxapine (inhalation) in patients with renal impairment.\n\n【34】 ### Hepatic Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Loxapine (inhalation) in patients with hepatic impairment.\n\n【35】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Loxapine (inhalation) in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n\n【36】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\nThere is no FDA guidance one the use of Loxapine (inhalation) in patients who are immunocompromised.\n\n【37】 # Administration and Monitoring\n\n【38】 ### Administration\n- Inhalation\n\n【39】 ### Monitoring\nThere is limited information regarding Monitoring of Loxapine (inhalation) in the drug label.\n\n【40】 # IV Compatibility\nThere is limited information regarding IV Compatibility of Loxapine (inhalation) in the drug label.\n\n【41】 # Overdosage\nSigns and Symptoms of Overdosage\n- As would be expected from the pharmacologic actions of loxapine, the clinical findings may include CNS depression, unconsciousness, profound hypotension, respiratory depression, extrapyramidal symptoms, and seizure.\nManagement of Overdosage\n- For the most up to date information on the management of ADASUVE overdosage, contact a certified poison control center (1-800-222-1222 or ). Provide supportive care including close medical supervision and monitoring. Treatment should consist of general measures employed in the management of overdosage with any drug. Consider the possibility of multiple drug overdosage. Ensure an adequate airway, oxygenation, and ventilation. Monitor cardiac rhythm and vital signs. Use supportive and symptomatic measures.\n\n【42】 # Pharmacology\n\n【43】 ## Mechanism of Action\n- The mechanism of action of loxapine in the treatment of agitation associated with schizophrenia is unknown. However, its efficacy could be mediated through a combination of antagonism of central dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2A receptors. The mechanism of action of loxapine in the treatment of agitation associated with bipolar I disorder is unknown.\n\n【44】 ## Structure\n- ADASUVE, a typical antipsychotic, is an inhalation powder of loxapine supplied in a single-use, disposable inhaler containing 10 mg of loxapine base. ADASUVE is a drug-device combination product.\nActive Ingredient: Loxapine (base). Loxapine, a dibenzoxazepine compound, represents a subclass of tricyclic antipsychotic agents, chemically distinct from the thioxanthenes, butyrophenones, and phenothiazines. Chemically, it is 2-Chloro-11-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl) dibenz   oxazepine.\n- ADASUVE is a single-use, drug-device combination product that provides rapid systemic delivery by inhalation of a thermally-generated aerosol of loxapine. Oral inhalation through the product initiates the controlled rapid heating of a thin film of excipient-free loxapine to form a thermally-generated drug vapor. The vapor condenses into aerosol particles that are dispersed into the airstream created by the patient inhaling through the mouthpiece.\n- Each product is packaged inside a sealed foil pouch. The product is a white to off-white plastic unit, with a mouthpiece on one end and a pull-tab protruding from the other end.\n- Removal of a pull-tab from the product renders it ready for use, as indicated by illumination of a green light. After inhalation through the mouthpiece, successful dosing is signaled by the green light turning off.\n- Under standardized in vitro test conditions, ADASUVE, 10 mg delivers 9.1 mg of loxapine out of the mouthpiece.\n\n【45】 ## Pharmacodynamics\n- Loxapine acts as an antagonist at central serotonin and dopamine receptors, with high affinity for serotonin 5-HT2A and dopamine D1, D2, D3, and D4 receptors (Ki values of 2 nM, 18 nM, 10 nM, 21 nM, 9 nM, respectively). Some of the adverse effects of loxapine may be related to the antagonism of histamine H1 (somnolence), muscarinic M1 (anticholinergic), and adrenergic α2 (orthostatic hypotension) receptors (Ki values of 15 nM, 117 nM and 250 nM, respectively).\nThorough QTc Study\n- ADASUVE did not prolong the QTc interval. The effect of ADASUVE on QTc prolongation was evaluated in a randomized, double-blinded, positive- (moxifloxacin 400 mg) and placebo-controlled parallel study in healthy subjects. A total of 48 healthy subjects were administered ADASUVE 10 mg. In this study with a demonstrated ability to detect small effects, the upper bound of the 90% confidence interval (CI) for the largest placebo-adjusted, baseline-corrected QTc based on individual correction method was below 10 milliseconds, the threshold for regulatory concern.\n\n【46】 ## Pharmacokinetics\nAbsorption: The single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of loxapine following administration of single doses of ADASUVE 10 mg in healthy adult subjects are presented in  and \n- Administration of ADASUVE resulted in rapid absorption of loxapine, with a median time of maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) of 2 minutes. Loxapine exposure in the first 2 hours after administration (AUC0-2h) was 66.7 ngh/mL for the 10 mg dose. As a consequence of the very rapid absorption of loxapine after oral inhalation, there is substantial variability in the early plasma concentrations of loxapine. The mean plasma loxapine concentrations following administration of ADASUVE were linear over the clinical dose range. AUC0-2h, AUCinf, and Cmax increased in a dose-dependent manner.\nDistribution: Loxapine is removed rapidly from the plasma and distributed in tissues. Animal studies following oral administration suggest an initial preferential distribution in the lungs, brain, spleen, heart, and kidney. Loxapine is 96.6% bound to human plasma proteins.\nMetabolism: Loxapine is metabolized extensively in the liver following oral administration, with multiple metabolites formed. The main metabolic pathways inclu\nExcretion: Excretion occurs mainly in the first 24 hours. Metabolites are excreted in the urine in the form of conjugates and in the feces unconjugated. The terminal elimination half-life (T1/ ranged from 6 to 8 hours.\nTransporter Interaction: In vitro studies indicated that loxapine was not a substrate for p-glycoprotein (P-gp): however, loxapine inhibited P-gp.\nSpecial Populations:\nPharmacokinetics in Smokers: Loxapine exposures in nonsmokers and smokers are similar, with geometric mean ratios of 92%, 85%, and 99% for AUC0-2h, AUCinf, and Cmax respectively. No dosage adjustment is recommended based on smoking status.\nDemographic Effects: There were no clinically significant differences in loxapine pharmacokinetics following administration of ADASUVE in subgroups based on age, weight, body mass index, gender, or race.\n\n【47】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\nCarcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\nCarcinogenesis: No adequate studies have been conducted.\nMutagenesis: Loxapine did not cause mutation or chromosomal aberration when tested in vitro and in vivo. Loxapine was negative in the Ames gene mutation assay, the human peripheral blood lymphocyte chromosomal aberration assay, and in the in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay up to 40 mg/kg (20-fold the MRHD on mg/m2 basis).\n- Loxapine metabolite 8-OH-loxapine was not mutagenic in the in vitro Ames reverse mutation assay and was not clastogenic in the in vitro human peripheral blood lymphocyte chromosomal aberration assay.\nImpairment of Fertility: Loxapine had no effects on fertility or early embryonic development in male rats or in male and female rabbits following oral administration. Mating was decreased in female rats because these animals were in persistent diestrus, an expected pharmacologic effect for this class of compounds. This occurred at doses approximately 0.2- and 1-fold the MRHD of 10 mg/day on a mg/m2 basis.\nAnimal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology\n- In the rat, minimal and reversible squamous metaplasia of the larynx was observed after daily inhalation exposure of loxapine for 14 days at 1.7 to 13 mg/kg/day (approximately 2- to 13-fold the MRHD of 10 mg/day on a mg/m2 basis, respectively). This finding was considered a nonspecific particle impaction effect. Mammary hyperplasia in males and females and ovarian follicular cysts and mucification of vaginal epithelium in female rats were observed at all doses, with partial or complete recovery at the end of 14 days of treatment. In the dog, no effects on the respiratory tract or reproductive tissues were observed after inhalation exposure to loxapine for 28 days at doses up to 1.8 mg/kg/day (approximately 6-fold the MRHD of 10 mg/day on a mg/m2 basis).\n\n【48】 # Clinical Studies\n- The efficacy of ADASUVE 10 mg in the acute treatment of agitation associated with schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder was established in two short-term (24-hour), randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose trials. Study 1 included 344 patients who met DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia. Study 2 included 314 patients who met DSM-IV criteria for bipolar I disorder, manic or mixed episodes with or without psychotic features.\n- Patients were judged by the clinical investigators to be clinically agitated, with a level of agitation that met or exceeded a specific severity threshold as measured by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale-Excited Component (PEC). The PEC is an investigator-rated instrument consisting of 5 items: poor impulse control, tension, hostility, uncooperativeness, and excitement. Each item is scored on a scale from 1 to 7 (1 = absent, 4 = moderate, 7 = extreme). Thus, the total PEC score can range from 5 to 35. For enrollment in the studies, patients had to have a PEC score of ≥ 14, with at least one individual item score ≥ 4.\n- Patients whose agitation was related to acute alcohol or drug intoxication were excluded. Patients with clinically significant acute or chronic pulmonary disease (e.g., asthma, COPD, chronic bronchitis, and emphysema) were excluded from the trials.\n- The primary efficacy endpoint in both trials was the mean change from baseline in the PEC score, assessed 2 hours following dosing. The key secondary endpoint was the mean Clinical Global Impression Improvement (CGI-I) Scale score at two hours. The CGI-I is an investigator-rated global assessment of symptom improvement, scored on a scale of 1 to 7: 1 = very much improved; 4 = no change from baseline; 7 = very much worse.\n- In both studies, mean baseline PEC scores were similar in all treatment groups, averaging 17.3 to 17.7 , with individual patient scores ranging from 14 to 31, indicating predominantly moderate levels of agitation. The mean baseline Clinical Global Impression Severity Scale (CGI-S) score in both studies was 4 (moderately ill). In Study 2, 69% of patients had a current manic episode, and 31% had a mixed/manic episode.\n- In Studies 1 and 2, treatment with ADASUVE was statistically significantly superior to placebo on the mean change in PEC score at 2 hours . In both studies, the effect of ADASUVE was apparent at 10 minutes following dosing s 9 and .\n- Examination of population subsets (age, race, and gender) on the primary endpoint did not reveal any differential responsiveness on the basis of these subgroupings.\n- s 9 and 10 show the decreases in PEC score at each time point assessed in the trials. In both trials, the decrease in agitation with ADASUVE was apparent at each time point tested .\n- The results of the secondary endpoint, CGI-I scores, are shown in \n\n【49】 # How Supplied\n- ADASUVE (loxapine) inhalation powder is supplied as:\n- ADASUVE 10 mg (NDC 57844-510- is a single-use, disposable inhaler containing 10 mg of loxapine, provided in a sealed foil pouch.

There is no consistently reliable test that can distinguish Parkinson's disease from other conditions that have a similar clinical presentation. The diagnosis is primarily based on a clinical history and examination.\nParkinson's disease is one of the most common neurological conditions. It is estimated to affect up to 160 people per 100,000, with an annual incidence in the UK of 15 to 20 per 100,000.\nPeople with Parkinson's disease classically present with the symptoms and signs described as 'parkinsonism': these include bradykinesia (slow movements), rigidity, rest tremor (shaking) and postural instability (loss of balance).\nThe symptoms of parkinsonism are not always a result of Parkinson's disease. Other causes include side effects of medicines, vascular disease, and less common degenerative conditions such as progressive supranuclear palsy and multiple system atrophy.\nParkinson's disease has historically been recognised as a primary movement disorder; however, other symptoms may be prominent, such as depression, cognitive impairment and dementia. In the later stages of the disease, people may develop pain and autonomic disturbances (such as dizziness and fainting, and problems with sweating, heart rate, digestion, vision and sexual function). These other symptoms are sometimes described as the 'non-motor' manifestations of Parkinson's disease. The condition may progress to cause significant impairments, adversely affecting quality of life and, indirectly, the quality of life of family and carers.# Recommendations for research\nThe guideline committee has made the following recommendations for research. The committee's full set of research recommendations is detailed in the full guideline.\n\n【45】 # Combination treatment for Parkinson's disease dementia\nWhat is the effectiveness of combination treatment with a cholinesterase inhibitor and memantine for people with Parkinson's disease dementia if treatment with a cholinesterase inhibitor alone is not effective or no longer effective?\n\n【46】 ## Why this is important\nThe guideline committee felt that cholinesterase inhibitors, memantine and combination therapy with both treatments are all reasonable clinical options, but noted that some people do not tolerate cholinesterase inhibitors well due to side effects. The evidence base for memantine was considerably weaker than for cholinesterase inhibitors, and therefore there would be value in either additional trials of memantine compared with placebo (in people for whom cholinesterase inhibitors are not an option), or non-inferiority studies compared with cholinesterase inhibitors.\nIn clinical practice, memantine is often added to a cholinesterase inhibitor when it is no longer proving effective, but there is no evidence base for this and randomised trials to establish whether there is additional benefit would be valuable. Both of these questions could potentially be answered in a single study with 3 arms of memantine monotherapy, cholinesterase inhibitor monotherapy and combination treatment.\n\n【47】 # Orthostatic hypotension treatment\nFor people with Parkinson's disease, what is the most effective pharmacological treatment for orthostatic hypotension?\nParticular interventions and comparisons of interest are:\nmidodrine compared with fludrocortisone (primary comparison)\npyridostigmine\nephedrine\npseudoephedrine.\n\n【48】 ## Why this is important\nThe guideline committee felt that orthostatic hypotension was an important practical problem, common in people with Parkinson's disease and a contributor to falls and injuries. The current best pharmacological treatment is not yet established and research in this area would help to determine this. The randomised controlled trials that have previously been undertaken have only provided low-quality evidence (because of both small sample sizes and weaknesses in the trial designs) and cover only a subset of the comparisons of interest, making future research in this area of value.\n\n【49】 # Psychotic symptoms (hallucinations and delusions)\nWhat is the effectiveness of rivastigmine compared with atypical antipsychotic drugs for treating psychotic symptoms (particularly hallucinations and delusions) associated with Parkinson's disease?\n\n【50】 ## Why this is important\nRivastigmine is commonly used to treat Parkinson's disease psychosis because it has shown some effectiveness in improving behavioural symptoms in people with Parkinson's disease dementia. At present, no evidence exists to support the efficacy of rivastigmine in treating people with Parkinson's disease whose symptoms are predominantly psychotic. It would be beneficial to undertake primary research in this area to determine the most effective treatment options for managing Parkinson's disease psychosis.\n\n【51】 # Rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder treatment\nWhat is the best first-line treatment for rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) in people with Parkinson's disease?\n\n【52】 ## Why this is important\nThe guideline committee highlighted the importance of minimising RBD, for both people with Parkinson's disease and their carers, particularly because of potential safety concerns. Only 1 paper was found to address optimal management, and this involved people in whom first-line treatment had failed. With multiple possible treatment options and no current evidence on what the most effective first-line treatment is, research (in the form of randomised controlled trials) in this area would be beneficial.\n\n【53】 # Physiotherapy\nDoes physiotherapy started early in the course of Parkinson's disease, as opposed to after motor symptom onset, confer benefits in terms of delaying symptom onset and/or reducing severity?\n\n【54】 ## Why this is important\nThe guideline committee felt that physiotherapy was beneficial for those earlier in the course of the disease as it may delay or lessen problems associated with symptoms, as well as for those who have developed symptoms and problems. At present, no substantial evidence exists to support the efficacy of physiotherapy as an early intervention to prevent the onset or reduce severity of motor symptoms, because most of the trials have been conducted in people who have already developed motor symptoms.\nIf physiotherapy were shown to have a beneficial effect in either delaying the onset or decreasing the severity of symptoms, this would have a substantial beneficial impact on the quality of life of people with Parkinson's disease and their family and carers. Relevant trials would not compare physiotherapy with no physiotherapy, but rather early physiotherapy (at the time of diagnosis) with physiotherapy offered at the current standard times in the UK.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

In general, they are  small, unilateral, and hormonally inactive. They are rich in adipose tissue and hematopoietic elements. Most lesions are small and asymptomatic. Adrenolipomas are usually detected incidentally in autopsy or by imaging studies performed for other reasons. Most tumors are unilateral, they show no predilection to one peculiar side. Symptoms of adrenolipoma include abdominal pain, haematuria, and abdominal fullness. Surgery is the mainstay of treatment.\n\n【2】 # Historical Perspective\nAdrenolipoma was first discovered by Gierke in 1905.\n\n【3】 # Classification\nMyelolipomas are classified into 4 type based on their clinicopathologic patterns:\n- Isolated adrenal myelolipoma\n- Adrenal myelolipoma with acute hemorrhage\n- Extra-adrenal myelolipoma\n- Myelolipoma associated with other adrenal diseases.\n\n【4】 # Pathophysiology\n- Myelolipomas are usually less than 4 cm in size occasionally measuring more than 10 cm in size.\n- Extra-adrenal sites for myelolipomas include the retroperitoneum, thorax, and pelvis.\n involve both adrenals.\n- One hypothesis suggests that stimuli, such as necrosis, inflammation, infection, or stress could cause adrenocortical cell metaplasia\n- If chronically present these stimulants lead to the development of neoplasms.\n- This hypothesis is supported by the increased incidence of the lesion in the advanced years of life.\n- On gross pathologic examination, a cut section of a myelolipoma has a variegated appearance consisting of bright yellow areas of fat, dark red areas of hematopoietic myeloid tissue, and areas with intermixed red and yellow components.\n- On histopathologic examination, myelolipomas are predominantly composed of fatty areas with interspersed hematopoietic tissue components.\nThese fatty elements and hematopoietic areas may be clearly separated, or they are often intermixed.\nTissue analysis often reveals a variable amalgamation of myeloid and erythroid cells, megakaryocytes, and occasionally lymphocytes.\nIn an isolated adrenal myelolipoma, a peripheral rim of normal adrenal cortical tissue can be commonly identified distinctly from the mass.\nRarely the myelolipomas can contain osteoid tissue in addition to the myeloid tissue.\nThe hemorrhagic areas may be partly replaced by fibrotic tissue or may undergo calcification\n- These fatty elements and hematopoietic areas may be clearly separated, or they are often intermixed.\n- Tissue analysis often reveals a variable amalgamation of myeloid and erythroid cells, megakaryocytes, and occasionally lymphocytes.\n- In an isolated adrenal myelolipoma, a peripheral rim of normal adrenal cortical tissue can be commonly identified distinctly from the mass.\n- Rarely the myelolipomas can contain osteoid tissue in addition to the myeloid tissue.\n- The hemorrhagic areas may be partly replaced by fibrotic tissue or may undergo calcification\n\n【5】 # Causes\nThere are no established causes for adrenolipoma. However, Adrenal myelolipoma is often associated with conditions which can be considered as adrenal stimulants such as\n- Cushing's disease\n- Obesity\n- Hyperlipidemia\n- Hypertension\n- Diabetes\n- Stressful lifestyle\n- Unbalanced diet\n\n【6】 # Differentiating Adrenolipoma from other Disease\nAdrenolipoma must be differentiated from retroperitoneal liposarcoma, adrenal teratoma, and adrenocortical carcinoma.\n\n【7】 # Epidemiology and Demographics\n- The incidence of adrenolipoma is approximately 0.8-4 per 100,000 individuals worldwide.\n- Adrenolipoma affects men and women equally.\n- Adrenolipomas are usually recognized in adults, either incidentally at ultrasound or computed topography or may present with vague abdominal symptoms if complicated by hemorrhage.\n\n【8】 # Risk Factors\nThere are no established risk factors.\n\n【9】 # Screening\nThere is insufficient evidence to recommend routine screening for adrenolipoma.\n\n【10】 # Complications\nCommon complications of adrenolipoma include Cushing syndrome, Conn syndrome, congenital adrenal hyperplasia and retroperitoneal haemorrhage.\n\n【11】 # Diagnosis\n\n【12】 ## History and Symptoms\nSymptoms of adrenolipoma include abdominal pain, haematuria, and abdominal fullness.\n\n【13】 ## Laboratory Findings\nThere are no associated laboratory findings among the majority of patients with adrenolipoma.\n\n【14】 ## Abdominal X-Ray\nThere are no abdominal X-ray findings associated with adrenolipoma.\n\n【15】 ## CT\nAbdominal CT scan may be helpful in the diagnosis of adrenolipoma.\n\n【16】 ## MRI\nAbdominals MRI may be helpful in the diagnosis of adrenolipoma.\n\n【17】 ## Ultrasonography\nOn ultrasound, adrenolipoma is characterized by heterogenous mass of mixed hyper- and hypoechoic components.\n\n【18】 ## Other Diagnostic Studies\nOther diagnostic studies for adrenolipoma include fine needle aspiration and fluorodeoxyglucose uptake (FDG).\n\n【19】 # Treatment\n\n【20】 ## Medical Therapy\nThere is no treatment for adrenolipoma; the mainstay of therapy is supportive care.\n\n【21】 ## Surgery\n- Surgery is the mainstay of treatment of large adrenolipomas. Management of adrenal myelolipoma is decided based upon the size of lesion and presence of symptoms.\n- Small lesions measuring less than 5 cm, and those who are asymptomatic are usually monitored via imaging over a period of one to two years.\n- Symptomatic tumors or myelolipomas larger than 7 cm should undergo elective surgical excision.\nThe approach is based on the reported incidence of life-threatening emergencies caused by spontaneous rupture and hemorrhage within large lesions.\nConventional or endoscopic access may be chosen according to the size of the tumor.\nMini-invasive and endoscopic techniques are best utilized for smaller-sized lesions, depending on the expertise of the operator.\nConventional methods including transabdominal, lumbar, subcostal or posterior access laparotomy operations have all been described in the literature.\nAn extraperitoneal approach is preferable as it leads to quicker recovery of the patient and lesser postoperative complications.\nThe midline approach is indicated for masses larger than 10 cm or in cases where there are adhesions and infiltration of the surrounding structures.\nFollow up is mandatory regardless of which surgical method has been employed.\n- The approach is based on the reported incidence of life-threatening emergencies caused by spontaneous rupture and hemorrhage within large lesions.\n- Conventional or endoscopic access may be chosen according to the size of the tumor.\n- Mini-invasive and endoscopic techniques are best utilized for smaller-sized lesions, depending on the expertise of the operator.\n- Conventional methods including transabdominal, lumbar, subcostal or posterior access laparotomy operations have all been described in the literature.\n- An extraperitoneal approach is preferable as it leads to quicker recovery of the patient and lesser postoperative complications.\n- The midline approach is indicated for masses larger than 10 cm or in cases where there are adhesions and infiltration of the surrounding structures.\n- Follow up is mandatory regardless of which surgical method has been employed.\n\n【22】 ## Primary Prevention\nThere are no preventive measurements available for adrenolipoma.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "f2861854-c793-4576-8a29-11d4cc8d7aa9", "title": null, "text": "【0】 Organic food\nOrganic foods are produced according to certain production standards, meaning they are grown without the use of conventional pesticides, artificial fertilizers, human waste, or sewage sludge, and that they were processed without ionizing radiation or food additives.  Livestock are reared without the routine use of antibiotics and without the use of growth hormones. In most countries, organic produce must not be genetically modified.\nOrganic food production is legally regulated. Currently, the United States, the European Union, Japan and many other countries require producers to obtain organic certification in order to market food as organic.\nHistorically, organic farms have been relatively small family-run farms — which is why organic food was once only available in small stores or farmers' markets. However, since the early 1990s organic food has had growth rates of around 20% a year, far ahead of the rest of the food industry, in both developed and developing nations. As of April 2008, organic food accounts for 1-2% of food sales worldwide. Future growth is expected to range from 10-50% annually depending on the country.\n\n【1】 # Identifying organic food\nProcessed organic food usually contains only organic ingredients, or where there are a number of ingredients, at least a minimum percentage of the plant and animal ingredients must be organic (95% in the United States and Australia). Any non-organically produced ingredients must still meet requirements. Foods claiming to be organic must be free of artificial food additives, and are often processed with fewer artificial methods, materials and conditions (no chemical ripening, no food irradiation, and no genetically modified ingredients, etc.).\n be required to be produced using energy-saving technologies and packaged using recyclable or biodegradable materials when possible.\nEarly consumers interested in organic food would look for non-chemically treated, fresh or minimally processed food. They mostly had to buy directly from growers: \"Know your farmer, know your food\" was the motto. Personal definitions of what constituted \"organic\" were developed through firsthand experience: by talking to farmers, seeing farm conditions, and farming activities. Small farms grew veges (and raised livestock) using organic farming practices, with or without certification, and the individual consumer monitored. As demand for organic foods continues to increase, high volume sales through mass outlets such as supermarkets are rapidly replacing the direct farmer connection. However, for supermarket consumers, food production is not easily observable, and product labelling, like \"certified organic\", is relied on. Government regulations and third-party inspectors are looked to for assurance. A \"certified organic\" label is usually the only way for consumers to know that a processed product is \"organic\".\n\n【2】 ## Legal definition\nTo be certified organic, products must be grown and manufactured in a manner that adheres to standards set by the country they are sold in:\n- Australia: NASAA Organic Standard\n- Britain: Organic Farmers and Growers Organic Standards and the Soil Association\n- Canada: Canada Gazette, Government of Canada\n- European Union: EU-Eco-regulation\nSweden: KRAV\n- Sweden: KRAV\n- India:  NPOP, (National Program for Organic Production)\n- Japan: JAS Standards.\n- United States: National Organic Program (NOP) Standards\n\n【3】 # Environmental impact\nSeveral surveys and studies have attempted to examine and compare conventional and organic systems of farming. The general consensus across these surveys is that, in the short term, organic farming is less damaging for the following reasons:\n- Organic farms do not consume or release synthetic pesticides into the environment — some of which have the potential to harm soil, water and local terrestrial and aquatic wildlife.\n- Organic farms are better than conventional farms at sustaining diverse ecosystems, i.e., populations of plants and insects, as well as animals.\n- When calculated either per unit area or per unit of yield, organic farms use less energy and produce less waste, e.g., waste such as packaging materials for chemicals.\nHowever, many critics of organic farming methods believe that the increased land needed to farm organic food could potentially destroy the rainforests and wipe out many ecosystems. \n\n【4】 ## Yield\nOne study found a 20% smaller yield from organic farms using 50% less fertilizer and 97% less pesticide.  Studies comparing yields have had mixed results. Supporters claim that organically managed soil has a higher quality and higher water retention. This may help increase yields for organic farms in drought years. One study of two organic farming systems and one conventional found that, in one year's severe crop season drought, organic soybean yields were 52% and 96% higher than the conventional system and organic maize yields were 37% higher in one system, but 62% lower in the other.\nOne study from the Danish Environmental Protection Agency found that, area-for-area, organic farms of potatoes, sugar beet and seed grass produce as little as half the output of conventional farming.  Findings like these, and the dependence of organic food on manure from low-yield cattle, has prompted criticism from many scientists that organic farming is environmentally unsound and incapable of feeding the world population. Among these critics are Norman Borlaug, father of the \"green revolution,\" and winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, who asserts that organic farming practices can at most feed 4 billion people, after expanding cropland dramatically and destroying ecosystems in the process.\nHowever a recent study  compiling research from 293 different comparisons into a single study to assess the overall efficiency of the two agricultural systems has concluded that\n-rganic methods could produce enough food on a global per capita basis to sustain the current human population, and potentially an even larger population, without increasing the agricultural land base (from the abstract)\n found that while in developed countries, organic systems on average produce 92% of the yield produced by conventional agriculture, organic systems produce 80% more than conventional farms in developing countries, because the materials needed for organic farming are more accessible than synthetic farming materials to farmers in poor countries.\n\n【5】 ## Energy Efficiency\n consistent in showing that organic farms are more energy efficient. However, alternative views hold that this may be deceptive, based on fossil fuel usage but ignoring energy costs of plowing and other laborious practices used on organic farms to maintain yields.\n\n【6】 ## Pesticides and farmers\nThere have been many studies on the health effects of pesticide exposure to those who work on farms. Even when pesticides are used correctly, they still end up in the air and bodies of farm workers. Through these studies, organophosphate pesticides have become associated with acute health problems such as abdominal pain, dizziness, headaches, nausea, vomiting, as well as skin and eye problems. In addition, there have been many other studies that have found pesticide exposure is associated with more severe health problems such as respiratory problems, memory disorders, dermatologic conditions, cancer, depression, neurologic deficits, miscarriages, and birth defects. Summaries of peer-reviewed research have examined the link between pesticide exposure and neurological outcomes and cancer in organophosphate-exposed workers.\nImported fruits and veges from South America are more likely to contain high level of pesticides, even pesticides banned for use in the United States. Migratory birds, such as Swainson’s hawks, have wintering grounds in Argentina where thousands of them were found dead from monocrotophos insecticide poisoning.\n\n【7】 ## Pesticide residue\nA study published in 2002 showed that \"Organically grown foods consistently had about one-third as many residues as conventionally grown foods.\"\nMonitoring of pesticide residues in the United States is carried out by the Pesticide Data Program (part of USDA, which was created in 1990. It has since tested over 60 different types of food for over 400 different types of pesticides - with samples collected close to the point of consumption. Their most recent results found in 2005 that:\nSeveral studies corroborate this finding by having found that while 77 percent of conventional food carries synthetic pesticide residues, only about 25 percent of organic food does.\nA study published by the National Research Council in 1993 determined that for infants and children, the major source of exposure to pesticides is through diet. A recent study in 2006 measured the levels of organophosphorus pesticide exposure in 23 schoolchildren before and after replacing their diet with organic food. In this study it was found that levels of organophosphorus pesticide exposure dropped dramatically and immediately when the children switched to an organic diet. Food residue limits established by law are set specifically with children in mind and consider a child's lifetime ingestion of each pesticide.\nThere are controversial data on the health implications of certain pesticides. For example, the herbicide Atrazine has been shown in some experiments to be a teratogen, causing demasculinization in male frogs exposed to small concentrations.  Under the effects of Atrazine, male frogs were found to have greatly increased occurrencesof either malformed gonads, or testicular gonads which contain non-degenerate eggs. Effects were however significantly reduced in high concentrations, as is consistent with other teratogens affecting the endocrine system, such as estradiol.\nOrganic farming standards do not allow the use of synthetic pesticides, but they do allow the use of specific pesticides derived from plants. The most common organic pesticides, accepted for restricted use by most organic standards, include Bt, pyrethrum, and rotenone. Some organic pesticides, such as rotenone, have high toxicity to fish and aquatic creatures with some toxicity to mammals. It causes Parkinson's disease if injected into rats.\nThe United States Environmental Protection Agency and state agencies periodically review the licensing of suspect pesticides, but the process of de-listing is slow. One example of this slow process is exemplified by the pesticide Dichlorvos, or DDVP, which as recently as the year 2006 the EPA proposed its continued sale. The EPA has almost banned this pesticide on several occasions since the 1970s, but it never did so despite considerable evidence that suggests DDVP is not only carcinogenic but dangerous to the human nervous system — especially in children.\n\n【8】 # Taste and nutritional value\nThe biggest study ever of organic food was completed in 2007 (which has neither been peer-reviewed nor published yet ) and found that organic fruit and veges contain up to 40% more antioxidants than conventional equivalents, and that the was 90% for organic milk. The 4-year study was funded by the European Union and was the largest of its kind ever undertaken.\n rated higher than those grown conventionally. These differences are attributed to the greater soil quality resulting from organic farming techniques compared to those of conventional farming.\nSome studies have shown higher nutrient levels in organic fruit and veges compared with conventionally grown products. However, due to the difficulty with designing such experiments, the evidence was not considered conclusive until the release of the University of Sheffield study in 2007  above).\nA 2002 meta-analysis (a review of all past studies on the subject) found no proof that organic food offers greater nutritional values, more consumer safety or any distinguishable difference in taste.\nA new report published in March 2008 by The Organic Center, which promotes organic food, claims that organic food is on average 25% more nutritious than conventional food.\n\n【9】 # Cost\nOrganic products typically cost 10 to 40% more than similar conventionally produced products. Processed organic foods vary in price when compared to their conventional counterparts. An Australian study by Choice magazine in 2004 found processed organic foods in supermarkets to be 65% more expensive, but noted this was not consistent.\nPrices may be higher because organic produce is produced on a smaller scale, and may need to be milled or processed separately. Furthermore, there is an increase in shipping costs from more centralized production in otherwise regional markets. In the case of dairy and eggs, the animal's requirements such as the number of animals that can be raised per acre, or the breed of animal and its feed conversion ratio affects the cost.\n\n【10】 # Related movements\nVarious alternative organic standards are emerging. They generally bypass formal certification, which can be expensive and cumbersome, and provide their own definition of organic food. One such, the Authentic Food standard, proposed by leading US organic farmer Eliot Coleman, includes criteria that are incompatible with current agribusiness:\n- Fresh fruits and veges, milk, eggs and meat products are produced within a 50-mile radius of their place of their final sale.\n- The seed and storage crops (grains, beans, nuts, potatoes, etc.) are produced within a 300-mile radius of their final sale.\n- Only traditional processed foods such as cheese, wine, bread and lactofermented products may claim, \"Made with Authentic ingredients.\"\n implementing new approaches to defining and buying food. Community-supported agriculture (CSA) is one such approach, that cuts out all the middlemen by having consumers partner with local farmers. CSA members prepurchase \"shares\" in a season's harvest, and pick up their weekly portions from distribution sites. Thus, consumers provide direct financing for farms, participate in the risks and rewards of annual growing conditions, and participate with farmers in distribution networks.\nCSA is one example of \"buying locally,\" which is often valued by both the organic food consumer and producer. Generally speaking, locally-grown seasonal food can be brought to market more quickly than food that has to be transported long distances, and therefore can be better tasting and to some degree more nutritious by virtue of its freshness. Additionally, the act of buying foods that are locally-grown benefits local farmers and other employers. This local food approach is seen as a direct investment in one's own community and a way to reduce economic dependence.\n often linked with the fair trade movement, based on the principle that social and environmental sustainability are inextricably interdependent.\n related to the organic movement. Michael Pollan, author of “The Omnivore's Dilemma”, notes that in the whole chain of food production and distribution, only one-fifth of the energy is used on the farm, the rest in distribution. Yet a report published by DEFRA, Britain's environment and farming ministry, concluded that shifts toward a local food production and distribution system, as advocated by many organic food proponents, would actually increase the amount of energy being invested in food due to the a higher level of small-scale transport systems, which suffer from inefficiencies compared to standard large-scale supermarket systems.\nAs highlighted by a recent New York Times article, food supply is a global issue that will become increasingly prominent in the near future.  \"Everywhere, the cost of food is rising sharply. Whether the world is in for a long period of continued increases has become one of the most urgent issues in economics.  \\.  Farmers the world over are producing flat-out. American agricultural exports are expected to increase 23 percent this year to $101 billion, a record. The world’s grain stockpiles have fallen to the lowest levels in decades.\n'Everyone wants to eat like an American on this globe,' said Daniel W. Basse of the AgResource Company, a Chicago consultancy. 'But if they do, we’re going to need another two or three globes to grow it all.'\"  Given the debate around Organic's ability to match the yields of conventional methods and the rising global demand for food, this debate is likely to see increased scrutiny in the future.\n\n【11】 # Facts and statistics\nWhile organic food accounts for 1–2% of total food sales worldwide, the organic food market is growing rapidly, far ahead of the rest of the food industry, in both developed and developing nations.\n- World organic food sales jumped from US $23 billion in 2002 to $40 billion in 2006.\n- The world organic market has been growing by 20% a year since the early 1990s, with future growth estimates ranging from 10-50% annually depending on the country.\n\n【12】 ## North America\n- Organic food sales have grown by 17 to 20 percent a year for the past few years while sales of conventional food have grown at only about 2 to 3 percent a year.\n- In 2003 organic products were available in nearly 20,000 natural food stores and 73% of conventional grocery stores.\n- Organic products account for 2.6% of total food sales in the year 2005.\n- Two thirds of organic milk and cream and half of organic cheese and yogurt are sold through conventional supermarkets.\n- Organic food sales surpassed $1 billion in 2006, accounting for 0.9% of food sales in Canada.\n- Organic food sales by grocery stores were 28% higher in 2006 than in 2005. \n- British Columbians account for 13% of the Canadian population, but purchased 26% of the organic food sold in Canada in 2006. \n\n【13】 ## Europe\nIn the European Union (EU 3.9% of the total utilized agricultural area is used for organic production. The countries with the highest proportion of organic land are Austria (11%) and Italy (8., followed by Czech Republic and Greece (both 7.2%). The lowest s are shown for Malta (0.1%), Poland (0.6%) and Ireland (0.8%)\n- 11.6% of all farmers produced organically in 2007. The government has created incentives to increase the to 20% by 2010.\n- 4.9% of all food products sold in Austrian supermarkets (including discount stores) in 2006 were organic. 8000 different organic products were available in the same year.\n- Since 2005 all school lunches must be organic by law.\n- In 2005 168,000 ha of land were under organic management. 7 percent of Polish consumers buy food that was produced according to the EU-Eco-regulation. The value of the organic market is estimated at 50 million Euros .\n- Organic food sales increased from just over £100 million in 1993/94 to £1.21 billion in 2004 (an 11% increase on .\n\n【14】 ## Caribbean\n- After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1990, agricultural inputs that had previously been purchased from Eastern bloc countries were no longer available in Cuba, and many Cuban farms converted to organic methods out of necessity. Consequently, organic agriculture is a mainstream practice in Cuba, while it remains an alternative practice in most other countries. Although some products called organic in Cuba would not satisfy certification requirements in other countries (crops may be genetically modified, for example), Cuba exports organic citrus and citrus juices to EU markets that meet EU organic standards. Cuba's forced conversion to organic methods may position the country to be a global supplier of organic products.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Wolpoff, paleoanthropologists most closely associated with the multiregional hypothesis include   James Calcagno, John Hawks and Erik Trinkaus.\nThe alternative theory is the recent single-origin hypothesis (or Out-of-Africa model). While Out of Africa has clearly emerged as the mainstream view since the 1990s, advocates of the Multiregional Hypothesis point to some recent genetic data, continuing the debate between the two viewpoints.\n\n【1】 # Classification of hominid species\nEvaluation of the Multiregional theory revolves around the assumption or non-assumption of species barriers between early hominids.\n considered a descendant of early migrants.\n\n【2】 # History\n\n【3】 ## Polygenism\nAn older theory is Polygenic evolution, a multiple origins theory in which the different human populations or races had independent origins and evolved in isolation from each other.  Held by many scholars of the 19th century such as Haeckel and Klaatsch, and even some of the 20th, such as Carleton S. Coon, it is biologically impossible since all populations of a monophyletic taxonomical group, like the human species, must have a single origin with a common ancestor. Polygenism is sometimes mistaken for Multiregional evolution, because they are both hypotheses of evolution within a single species. However, Polygenic evolution depends on isolation of populations while Multiregional evolution requires population interactions and interbreeding so that genetic changes can spread throughout the human range, especially when they are promoted by natural selection.  According to the Multiregional hypothesis, geographic differences between human populations are the results of climatic variation, isolation by distance, sexual selection, and historical accidents (genetic drift).\n\n【4】 ## Weidenreich-Coon\nThe Multiregional Hypothesis has its origin in the work of Franz Weidenreich in the 1930s.  At that time, Weidenreich originated the \"Weidenreich Theory of Human Evolution\" based on his examination of Peking Man.  Weidenreich was an anatomist and observed numerous anatomical characteristics that Peking Man had in common with modern Asians.  The Weidenreich Theory stated that human races have evolved independently in the Old World from Homo erectus to Homo sapiens sapiens, while at the same time there was gene flow between the various populations.  According to the theory proposed by Weidenreich, genes that were generally adaptive (such as those for intelligence) flowed relatively rapidly from one part of the world to the other, while those that were locally adaptive, would not.  This is the direct opposite to theories of human evolution that have been popularized in the press with one superior race (e.g. Modern Humans) displacing other races (e.g. Neanderthals).  A vocal proponent of the Weidenreich theory was Carleton Coon.\n\n【5】 # Regional Continuity (Wolpoff)\nThe term \"multiregional hypothesis\" was first coined in the early 1980s by Milford H. Wolpoff and a group of associates as an explanation for the apparent similarities of the remains from the Homo erectus and Homo sapiens inhabiting the same region. This phenomenon was termed regional continuity and baffled the scientists at first. These scientists explained the apparent regional continuity by claiming Homo erectus and Homo sapiens were the same species and there had been just enough interbreeding to cause an overall global development towards the latter, but without stamping out the regional adaptation that had been developed by the former. Such a delicate balance seemed unlikely and puzzled the anthropologists.\nEventually, Milford H. Wolpoff proposed an explanation based on clinal variation that would allow for the necessary balance. This was the multiregional hypothesis. It theorizes that Homo erectus, Neanderthals, Homo sapiens and other humans were a single species. This species arose in Africa two million years ago as Homo erectus and then spread out over the world, developing adaptations to regional conditions.\nFor periods of time some populations became isolated, developing in a different direction. But through a complicated process involving  continuous interbreeding, replacement, genetic drift and other vehicles of evolution, adaptations that were an advantage anywhere on earth would spread, keeping the development of the species in the same overall direction, while maintaining adaptations to regional factors.\n with many common features.\n\n【6】 # Hybrid-origin theory\nThe hybrid-origin hypothesis of human origins argues that all or at least some of the genetic variation between the contemporary human races is attributo genetic inheritance from at least two widely divergent hominid species, or subspecies, that were geographically dispersed throughout Africa, Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent, prior to the evolution of modern Homo sapiens sapiens (according to hybrid-origin theory, approximately 35,000 years ago).\nHominid populations, put forward by the hybrid-origin theory as sources for genetic admixture, include Homo neanderthalensis and Peking Man (a subspecies of Homo erectus), and Cro-Magnon man (who physically and culturally  differs significantly from Homo erectus).\nThis theory was first introduced in 1971 by the British psychologist Stan Gooch.\nHere is a brief summary of Gooch's theory (from Guardians of the Ancient Wisdom :\n- From other human species, Cro-Magnon man evolves in Northern India during millions of years of isolation, develops and practices sun worship and hunting magic; the culture is patriarchal.\n- Elsewhere during the same period, different forms of Neanderthal evolve in Europe and the Middle East, while moon worship and earth magic is developed and practiced; the culture is matriarchal.\n- Around 35,000 years b.p. Cro-Magnon abandons India and heads west through the Middle East into Europe, overrunning Neanderthal.  By 25,000 years ago, the predominant type in Europe is Cro-Magnon.\n- In the Middle East a hybrid population, a cross between the Cro-Magnon and Neanderthal types, emerges.  Pure Neanderthal has largely ceased to exist either here or in Europe.\n ceased to exist, driven out of north and west Europe, into southern Europe, by renewed glaciation, absorbed by the hybrid type (that is, ourselves).\n migrated back into Africa (during glaciation in Europe the Sahara had become well-watered, grassy plains) and back into India and then on to China.  In these places the mixed type further mingled with the local Neanderthal types.\nAccording to this theory the resulting hybrid 'Homo sapiens sapiens', was superior to both its ancestors due to what is commonly termed hybrid vigour.\n\n【7】 # Fossil evidence\nStudies on past population bottlenecks that can be inferred from molecular data have led Multiregionalists to conclude that the recent single-origin hypothesis is untenable because there are no population size bottlenecks affecting all genes that are more recent than the one at the beginning of the species, some 2 million years ago. Multiregionalists claimed that the discovery of a possible hybrid Homo sapiens X neanderthalensis fossil child at the Abrigo do Lagar Velho rock-shelter site in Portugal in 1999 further supports the  Multiregional hypothesis, by reflecting the inter-mixture of diverse human populations. Other archaeologists dispute this: \"the analysis by Duarte of the Lagar Velho child's skeleton is a brave and imaginative interpretation, of which it is unlikely that a majority of paleoanthropologists will consider proven.\" \nIn an article appearing in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in 2007, Erik Trinkaus has brought together the available data, which shows that early modern humans did exhibit evidence of Neandertal traits.\n\"When you look at all of the well dated and diagnostic early modern European fossils, there is a persistent presence of anatomical features that were present among the Neandertals but absent from the earlier African modern humans,\" Trinkaus said. \"Early modern Europeans reflect both their predominant African early modern human ancestry and a substantial degree of admixture between those early modern humans and the indigenous Neandertals.\"\nProponents of the multiregional hypothesis point to a recent Australian study of an ancient Aboriginal skeleton known as Mungo Man. Genetic tests show the mitochondrial DNA of Mungo Man to be from a mtDNA lineage with no descendants today. Yet Mungo man is an anatomically modern human and has been dated to be at least 40,000 years old. These proponents interpret the study to mean that mtDNA does not reflect ancestry or divergence times, and this interpretation is supported by the discovery that the gene is subject to natural selection.\nA recent, non-fossilized discovery of one metre-tall, small-brained (350 cc), Homo floresiensis, on the Indonesian island of Flores, might imply populations of Homo erectus survived very late, and gave rise to even later, physically dwarfed isolated  \"erectus\" groups. However, this possibility does not address the Multiregional hypothesis, which is only about the human species, and the evidence is marred by the possibility that the single dwarf cranium found on Flores might have been pathological.\n\n【8】 # Genetic evidence\nProponents of the Multiregional or Hybrid-origin hypothesis point to the study of divided deply in time, in scale of 1MYA, genetic linaeges and interpret it as genetic evidence for inter-breeding between 'Humans' and other 'hominids'.\n- Microcephalin. \n- RRM2P4 region on X chromosome.\n- PDHA1 locus on X chromosome.\n\n【9】 # Criticism of Multiregionalism\nMultiregional evolution contrasts with the mainstream \"Recent African Origin\" (RAO) theory. According to that theory, human evolution was a consequence of many cases of species replacement, as newer species replaced older ones across the human range.  Modern human origins, according to the RAO, is the most recent example of species replacement.\nAspects of multiregionalism have been criticized as not being based on objective scientific observation. Some critics even argue that multiregionalism may be motivated by ethnocentrism and is meant to instill beliefs of purity of lineage.\nMultiregionalists have long claimed that modern Europeans are descended from the Neanderthals. In 1997, DNA testing performed on a Neanderthal skeleton showed modern humans and Neanderthals last shared a common ancestor between 500,000 and 800,000 years ago, and furthermore that all modern humans, from the ethnic Siberians to the !Kung people of Africa, are more closely related to each other than to the Neanderthals -- further evidence supporting the Out-of-Africa theory.\nAnother example is the case of Peking man, a fossil skull of homo erectus found in China dating to possibly 400,000 years. Some Paleoanthropologists in China have asserted that the modern Chinese are descendents of earlier forms of humans such as Peking Man. However, Chinese geneticists performed microsatellite analysis on the Chinese population in 1998 and discovered genetic similarities with Africans, yielding the first evidence that the Chinese descended from Africa.  A recent study undertaken by Jin Li showed no inter-breeding between modern human immigrants to East Asia and Homo erectus, contradicting the Peking Man-origin hypothesis and affirming that the Chinese descended from Africans. In 2001, Chinese geneticists analyzed Y chromosomes in Chinese people and concluded that all Chinese samples contained a mutated gene M168G which is a marker believed to have appeared in the last 79,000 years on a number of Africans.\n favors a single origin. This is because mainly in Africa is there a sensible progression of fossils over the last 3 million years that shows the various intermediate stages of evolution from the most archaic ancestors to modern man.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

The proportion of subjects who reported neuropsychiatric adverse events through Week 4 was 17% (62/ in the DELSTRIGO group and 49% (177/ in the EFV/FTC/TDF group. At Week 48, the prevalence of neuropsychiatric adverse events was 12% (44/ in the DELSTRIGO group and 22% (81/ in the EFV/FTC/TDF group.\n- The percentages of subjects with selected laboratory abnormalities (that represent a worsening from baseline) who were treated with doravirine or DRV+r in DRIVE-FORWARD, or DELSTRIGO or EFV/FTC/TDF in DRIVE-AHEAD are presented in \n- For DRIVE-FORWARD and DRIVE-AHEAD, changes from baseline at Week 48 in LDL-cholesterol, non-HDL-cholesterol, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and HDL-cholesterol are shown in \n- The LDL and non-HDL comparisons were pre-specified and are summarized in  The differences were statistically significant, showing superiority for doravirine for both parameters. The clinical benefit of these findings has not been demonstrated.\n\n【17】 ## Postmarketing Experience\nThere is limited information regarding Doravirine Postmarketing Experience in the drug label.\n\n【18】 # Drug Interactions\n- Co-administration of doravirine with a CYP3A inducer decreases doravirine plasma concentrations, which may reduce doravirine efficacy. Co-administration of doravirine and drugs that are inhibitors of CYP3A may result in increased plasma concentrations of doravirine.\n-  shows significant drug interactions with doravirine.\n- No clinically significant changes in concentration were observed for doravirine when co-administered with the following agents: dolutegravir, TDF, lamivudine, elbasvir and grazoprevir, ledipasvir and sofosbuvir, ritonavir, ketoconazole, aluminum hydroxide/magnesium hydroxide/simethicone containing antacid, pantoprazole, and methadone.\n- No clinically significant changes in concentration were observed for the following agents when co-administered with doravirine: dolutegravir, lamivudine, TDF, elbasvir and grazoprevir, ledipasvir and sofosbuvir, atorvastatin, an oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel, metformin, methadone, and midazolam.\n\n【19】 # Use in Specific Populations\n\n【20】 ### Pregnancy\nPregnancy Category (FDA): \nPregnancy Exposure Registry\n- There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in individuals exposed to doravirine during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by calling the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry (APR) at 1-800-258-4263.\nRisk Summary\n- No adequate human data are available to establish whether or not doravirine poses a risk to pregnancy outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental effects were observed when doravirine was administered at exposures ≥8 times the exposure in humans at the recommended human dose (RHD) of doravirine.\n\n【21】 Animal Data\n- Doravirine was administered orally to pregnant rabbits (up to 300 mg/kg/day on gestation days (GD) 7 to  and rats (up to 450 mg/kg/day on GD 6 to 20 and separately from GD 6 to lactation/postpartum day . No significant toxicological effects on embryo-fetal (rats and rabbits) or pre/post-natal (rats) development were observed at exposures (AUC) approximately 9 times (rats) and 8 times (rabbits) the exposure in humans at the RHD. Doravirine was transferred to the fetus through the placenta in embryo-fetal studies, with fetal plasma concentrations of up to 40% (rabbits) and 52% (rats) that of maternal concentrations observed on gestation day 20.\nPregnancy Category (AUS): \nThere is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Doravirine in women who are pregnant.\n\n【22】 ### Labor and Delivery\nThere is no FDA guidance on use of Doravirine during labor and delivery.\n\n【23】 ### Nursing Mothers\nRisk Summary\n- The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that HIV-1-infected mothers in the United States not breastfeed their infants to avoid risking potential transmission of HIV-1 infection.\n- It is unknown whether doravirine is present in human milk, affects human milk production, or has effects on the breastfed infant. Doravirine is present in the milk of lactating rats  DATA). Because of the potential for  HIV-1 transmission (in HIV-negative infants),  developing viral resistance (in HIV-positive infants), and  serious adverse reactions in a breastfed infant, instruct mothers not to breastfeed if they are receiving doravirine.\nData\n- Doravirine was excreted into the milk of lactating rats following oral administration (450 mg/kg/day) from gestation day 6 to lactation day 14, with milk concentrations approximately 1.5 times that of maternal plasma concentrations observed 2 hours post dose on lactation day 14.\n\n【24】 ### Pediatric Use\n- Safety and efficacy of doravirine have not been established in pediatric patients less than 18 years of age.\n\n【25】 ### Geriatic Use\n- Clinical trials of doravirine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, caution should be exercised in the administration of doravirine in elderly patients, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.\n\n【26】 ### Gender\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Doravirine with respect to specific gender populations.\n\n【27】 ### Race\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Doravirine with respect to specific racial populations.\n\n【28】 ### Renal Impairment\n- No dosage adjustment of doravirine is required in patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment. Doravirine has not been adequately studied in patients with end-stage renal disease and has not been studied in dialysis patients.\n\n【29】 ### Hepatic Impairment\n- No dosage adjustment of doravirine is required in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment. Doravirine has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C).\n\n【30】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Doravirine in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n\n【31】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\nThere is no FDA guidance one the use of Doravirine in patients who are immunocompromised.\n\n【32】 # Administration and Monitoring\n\n【33】 ### Administration\n- The recommended dosage regimen of doravirine in adults is one 100 mg t taken orally once daily with or without food.\n- If doravirine is co-administered with rifabutin, increase doravirine dosage to one t twice daily (approximately 12 hours apart) for the duration of rifabutin co-administration.\n\n【34】 ### Monitoring\nThere is limited information regarding Doravirine Monitoring in the drug label.\n\n【35】 # IV Compatibility\nThere is limited information regarding the compatibility of Doravirine and IV administrations.\n\n【36】 # Overdosage\nThere is limited information regarding Doravirine overdosage.  If you suspect drug poisoning or overdose, please contact the National Poison Help hotline (1-800-222- immediately.\n\n【37】 # Pharmacology\n\n【38】 ## Mechanism of Action\n- Doravirine is an antiretroviral drug.\n\n【39】 ## Structure\n- Doravirine has a molecular formula of C17H11ClF3N5O3 and a molecular weight of 425.75.\n- It has the following structural formula:\n\n【40】 ## Pharmacodynamics\n- In a Phase 2 trial evaluating doravirine over a dose range of 0.25 to 2 times the recommended dose of doravirine, (in combination with FTC/TDF) in HIV-1 infected subjects with no antiretroviral treatment history, no exposure-response relationship for efficacy was identified for doravirine.\nCardiac Electrophysiology\n- At a doravirine dose of 1200 mg, which provides approximately 4 times the peak concentration observed following the recommended dose of doravirine, doravirine does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent.\n\n【41】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n- Doravirine pharmacokinetics are similar in healthy subjects and HIV-1-infected subjects. Doravirine pharmacokinetics are provided in \nSpecific Populations\n- No clinically significant difference on the pharmacokinetics of doravirine were observed based on age (18 to 78 years of age), sex, and race/ethnicity, mild to severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance (CLcr) >15 mL/min, estimated by Cockcroft-Gault), or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B). The pharmacokinetics of doravirine in patients with end-stage renal disease or undergoing dialysis, severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C), or <18 years of age is unknown.\nPatients with Renal Impairment\n- In a study comparing 8 subjects with severe renal impairment to 8 subjects without renal impairment, the single dose exposure of doravirine was 43% higher in subjects with severe renal impairment. In a population pharmacokinetic analysis, renal function did not have a clinically relevant effect on doravirine pharmacokinetics. Doravirine has not been studied in patients with end-stage renal disease or in patients undergoing dialysis.\nPatients with Hepatic Impairment\n- No clinically significant difference in the pharmacokinetics of doravirine was observed in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score B) compared to subjects without hepatic impairment. Doravirine has not been studied in subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score C).\nDrug Interaction Studies\n- Doravirine is primarily metabolized by CYP3A, and drugs that induce or inhibit CYP3A may affect the clearance of doravirine. Co-administration of doravirine and drugs that induce CYP3A may result in decreased plasma concentrations of doravirine. Co-administration of doravirine and drugs that inhibit CYP3A may result in increased plasma concentrations of doravirine.\n- Doravirine is not likely to have a clinically relevant effect on the exposure of medicinal products metabolized by CYP enzymes. Doravirine did not inhibit major drug metabolizing enzymes in vitro, including CYPs 1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 3A4, and UGT1A1 and is not likely to be an inducer of CYP1A2, 2B6, or 3A4. Based on in vitro assays, doravirine is not likely to be an inhibitor of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, P-glycoprotein, BSEP, OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, MATE1, and MATE2K. Drug interaction studies were performed with doravirine and other drugs likely to be co-administered or commonly used as probes for pharmacokinetic interactions. The effects of co-administration with other drugs on the exposure (Cmax, AUC, and C of doravirine are summarized in  A single doravirine 100 mg dose was administered in these studies unless otherwise noted.\n- Based on drug interaction studies conducted with doravirine, no clinically significant drug interactions have been observed following the co-administration of doravirine and the following drugs: dolutegravir, ritonavir, TDF, lamivudine, elbasvir and grazoprevir, ledipasvir and sofosbuvir, ketoconazole, aluminum hydroxide/magnesium hydroxide/simethicone containing antacid, pantoprazole, atorvastatin, an oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel, metformin, methadone, and midazolam.\n\n【42】 ## Microbiology\nMechanism of Action\n- Doravirine is a pyridinone non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor of HIV-1 and inhibits HIV-1 replication by non-competitive inhibition of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT). Doravirine does not inhibit the human cellular DNA polymerases α, ß, and mitochondrial DNA polymerase γ.\nAntiviral Activity in Cell Culture\n- Doravirine exhibited an EC50 value of 12.0±4.4 nM against wild-type laboratory strains of HIV-1 when tested in the presence of 100% normal human serum (NHS) using MT4-GFP reporter cells. Doravirine demonstrated antiviral activity against a broad panel of primary HIV-1 isolates (A, A1, AE, AG, B, BF, C, D, G, H) with EC50 values ranging from 0.6 nM to 10.0 nM.\nAntiviral Activity in Combination with other HIV Antiviral Agents\n- The antiviral activity of doravirine in cell culture was not antagonistic when combined with the NNRTIs delavirdine, efavirenz, etravirine, nevirapine, or rilpivirine; the NRTIs abacavir, didanosine, emtricitabine, lamivudine, stavudine, tenofovir DF, or zidovudine; the PIs darunavir or indinavir; the gp41 fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide; the CCR5 co-receptor antagonist maraviroc; or the integrase strand transfer inhibitor raltegravir.\nResistance \nIn Cell Culture\n- Doravirine-resistant strains were selected in cell culture starting from wild-type HIV-1 of different origins and subtypes, as well as NNRTI-resistant HIV-1. Observed emergent amino acid substitutions in RT included: V106A, V106M, V106I, V108I, H221Y, F227C, F227I, F227L, F227V, M230I, L234I, P236L, and Y318F.\nIn Clinical Trials\n- In the doravirine treatment arms of the DRIVE-FORWARD and DRIVE-AHEAD trials (n=, 11 subjects showed the emergence of doravirine-associated resistance substitutions in their HIV among 28 (39%) subjects in the resistance analysis subset (subjects with HIV-1 RNA greater than 400 copies per mL at virologic failure or early study discontinuation and having resistance data). Emergent doravirine resistance-associated substitutions in RT included one or more of the following: A98G, V106I, V106A, V106M/T, V108I, E138G/K, Y188L, H221Y, P225H, F227C, F227C/R, and Y318Y/F. Seven of 11 (64%) subjects with emergent doravirine-associated resistance substitutions showed doravirine phenotypic resistance and all of them had at least a 100-fold reduction in doravirine susceptibility (range >97- to >211–fold reduction in doravirine susceptibility). The other 4 virologic failures who had only amino acid mixtures of NNRTI resistance substitutions showed doravirine phenotypic fold-changes of less than 2-fold. Of the 28 subjects in the resistance analysis subset, 8 subjects (29%) developed genotypic and/or phenotypic resistance to the other drugs (abacavir, lamivudine, emtricitabine, or TDF) in the regimens of the DRIVE-FORWARD and DRIVE-AHEAD trials. The resistance-associated substitutions that emerged were RT M41L (n=, A62V (n=, K65R (n=, T69T/A (n=, and M184V (n=.\n- In the DRV+r treatment arm of the DRIVE-FORWARD trial (n=, no subjects showed the emergence of darunavir-associated resistance substitutions among 9 subjects with resistance data and none of the subjects had emergent resistance to lamivudine or TDF. In the EFV/FTC/TDF treatment arm of the DRIVE-AHEAD trial (n=, 12 subjects showed the emergence of efavirenz-associated resistance substitutions among 20 (60%) subjects in the resistance analysis subset and genotypic resistance to emtricitabine or tenofovir developed in 5 evaluable subjects; emergent resistance-associated substitutions were RT K65R (n=, D67G/K70E (n=, L74V/V75M/V118I (n=, and M184V/I (n=.\nCross-Resistance\n- A panel of 96 diverse clinical isolates containing NNRTI-associated substitutions was evaluated for susceptibility to doravirine. Clinical isolates containing the Y188L substitution alone or in combination with K103N or V106I, V106A in combination with G190A and F227L, or E138K in combination with Y181C and M230L showed greater than 100-fold reduced susceptibility to doravirine.\n- Cross-resistance has been observed among NNRTIs. Treatment-emergent doravirine resistance-associated substitutions can confer cross resistance to efavirenz, etravirine, nevirapine, and rilpivirine. Of the 7 virologic failures who developed doravirine phenotypic resistance, all had phenotypic resistance to nevirapine, 6 had phenotypic resistance to efavirenz, 4 had phenotypic resistance to rilpivirine, and 3 had partial resistance to etravirine based on the Monogram PhenoSense assay.\n\n【43】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\nCarcinogenesis\n- Doravirine was not carcinogenic in long-term oral carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats at exposures up to 6 and 7 times, respectively, the human exposures at the RHD. A statistically significant incidence of thyroid parafollicular cell adenoma and carcinoma seen only in female rats at the high dose was within the range observed in historical controls.\nMutagenesis\n- Doravirine was not genotoxic in a battery of in vitro or in vivo assays, including microbial mutagenesis, chromosomal aberration in Chinese hamster ovary cells, and in in vivo rat micronucleus assays.\nImpairment of fertility\n- There were no effects on fertility, mating performance or early embryonic development when doravirine was administered to rats at systemic exposures (AUC) approximately 7 times the exposure in humans at the RHD.\n\n【44】 # Clinical Studies\n- The efficacy of doravirine is based on the analyses of 48-week data from two randomized, multicenter, double-blind, active controlled Phase 3 trials (DRIVE-FORWARD, NCT02275780 and DRIVE-AHEAD, NCT in HIV-1 infected subjects with no antiretroviral treatment history (n=.\n- In DRIVE-FORWARD, 766 subjects were randomized and received at least 1 dose of either doravirine once daily or darunavir 800 mg + ritonavir 100 mg (DRV+r) once daily each in combination with emtricitabine/tenofovir DF (FTC/TDF) or abacavir/lamivudine (ABC/3TC) selected by the investigator. At baseline, the median age of subjects was 33 years, 16% were female, 27% were non-white, 4% had hepatitis B and/or C virus co-infection, 10% had a history of AIDS, 20% had HIV-1 RNA greater than 100,000 copies/mL, 86% had CD4+ T-cell count greater than 200 cells/mm3, 13% received ABC/3TC, and 87% received FTC/TDF; these characteristics were similar between treatment groups.\n- In DRIVE-AHEAD, 728 subjects were randomized and received at least 1 dose of either DELSTRIGO (DOR/3TC/TDF) or EFV 600 mg/FTC 200 mg/TDF 300 mg once daily. At baseline, the median age of subjects was 31 years, 15% were female, 52% were non-white, 3% had hepatitis B or C co-infection, 14% had a history of AIDS, 21% had HIV-1 RNA greater than 100,000 copies/mL, and 88% had CD4+ T-cell count greater than 200 cells/mm3; these characteristics were similar between treatment groups.\n- Week 48 outcomes for DRIVE-FORWARD and DRIVE-AHEAD are provided in  Side-by-side tabulation is to simplify presentation; direct comparisons across trials should not be made due to differing trial designs.\n- In DRIVE-FORWARD, the mean CD4+ T-cell counts in the doravirine and DRV+r groups increased from baseline by 193 and 186 cells/mm3, respectively.\n- In DRIVE-AHEAD, the mean CD4+ T-cell counts in the DELSTRIGO and EFV/FTC/TDF groups increased from baseline by 198 and 188 cells/mm3, respectively.\n\n【45】 # How Supplied\n- Each doravirine t contains 100 mg of doravirine, is white, oval-shaped and film-coated, and is debossed with the corporate logo and 700 on one side and plain on the other side. Each bottle contains 30 ts (NDC 0006-3069- with silica gel desiccant and is closed with a child-resistant closure.\n\n【46】 ## Storage\n- Store doravirine in the original bottle. Keep the bottle tightly closed to protect from moisture. Do not remove the desiccant.\n- Store doravirine at 20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F); excursions permitted to 15°C to 30°C (59°F to 86°F).\n\n【47】 # Images\n\n【48】 ## Drug Images\n\n【49】 ## Package and Label Display Panel\n\n【50】 # Patient Counseling Information\nDrug Interactions\n- Inform patients that doravirine may interact with certain other drugs; therefore, advise patients to report to their healthcare provider the use of any other prescription or nonprescription medication or herbal products, including St. John's wort.\n- For patients concomitantly receiving rifabutin, take one t of doravirine twice daily (approximately 12 hours apart).\nImmune Reconstitution Syndrome\n- Inform patients that in some patients with advanced HIV infection (AIDS), signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV treatment is started. It is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body's immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious symptoms. Advise patients to inform their healthcare provider immediately of any symptoms of infection.\nDosing Instructions\n- Advise patients to take doravirine every day at a regularly scheduled time with or without food. Inform patients that it is important not to miss or skip doses as it can result in development of resistance. If a patient forgets to take doravirine, tell the patient to take the missed dose right away, unless it is almost time for the next dose. Advise the patient not to take 2 doses at one time and to take the next dose at the regularly scheduled time.\nPregnancy Registry\n- Inform patients that there is an antiretroviral pregnancy registry to monitor fetal outcomes in pregnant individuals exposed to doravirine.\nLactation\n- Instruct mothers with HIV-1 infection not to breastfeed because HIV-1 can be passed to the baby in breast milk.\n\n【51】 # Precautions with Alcohol\nAlcohol-Doravirine interaction has not been established.

Even these cosmic rays have too high an energy to originate from the solar photosphere. The coronal cloud in close proximity to the Sun may be a source or create them as it bombards the chromosphere from above.\n\"In particular we recognize a first trace of Vela, brightest gamma and radio galactic source, and smeared sources along Galactic Plane and Center .\"\n\"The main correlated map is the 408 MHz one. The first astronomical source that seem to correlate is the main multiplet along CenA. This AGN source, the nearest extragalactic one, sits in the same direction of a far Centaurus Cluster (part of the Super-Galactic Plane). The blurring by random galactic magnetic field might spread the nearest AGN event along the same Super-Galactic Plane, explaining the AUGER group miss-understanding .\"\n\n【1】 # Emissions\n\"Seyfert galaxies were originally noted for the strength and broadening of their emission lines, and as a class were later characterized by the high ionization states of many of the atomic and ionized species producing these lines. This composite spectrum of the archetypal Seyfert NGC 4151 shows the wide variety of emission lines present, from the Lyman limit at 912 A to the mid-infrared at about 9 microns. It uses spectra taken with apertures several arcseconds in size, so as to reproduce the usual spectrum mixing broad and narrow-line components. From 912-1800 A, the data come from the Shuttle-borne Hopkins Ultraviolet Telescope; from 1800-3200 A, from the mean of three measurements by the International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) taken at similar brightness levels; from 3200-4000A, from an observation at Kitt Peak National Observatory, with the continuum rescaled to match the adjacent spectra; from 4000-8000 A, a CCD observation obtained at the Lick Observatory 3-m Shane telescope by Alexei Filippenko; from 8000 A to 1 microns, an observation using the same telescope by Donald Osterbrock and collaborators, carefully corrected for atmospheric absorption; from 0.9-2.4 microns, measurements by Rodger Thompson at Steward Observatory's 2,3-m Bok telescope, and on into the infrared, from the Infrared Space Observatory provided by Eckhard Sturm. Because NGC 4151 is irregularly variable, some of the spectral components have been scaled to make the various pieces match for this presentation (so the relative strengths of lines in very different spectral regions may not be accurate).\"\n\n【2】 \"The spectra of active galactic nuclei are noteworthy in showing species with a large range in ionization at once, from neutral ions such as  and  to highly ionized cases such as  and . Even hot stars such as light up gaseous nebulae in our galaxy cannot ionize gas as highly as these ions require, so that both a strong source of hard radiation and a wide range in gas density must be present to see such spectra.\"\n\n【3】 # Standard candles\n“Accurate distances to celestial objects are key to establishing the age and energy density of the Universe and the nature of dark energy.”\n“A distance measure using active galactic nuclei (AGN) has been sought for more than forty years, as they are extremely luminous and can be observed at very large distances.”\n emit their own light signature. With both emissions in range of data gathering telescopes, all that’s needed is a way to measure the time it takes between the radiation signal and the ionization point. The process is called reverberation mapping.\"\n“We use the tight relationship between the luminosity of an AGN and the radius of its broad line region established via reverberation mapping to determine the luminosity distances to a sample of 38 AGN.”\n“All reliable distance measures up to now have been limited to moderate redshift — AGN will, for the first time, allow distances to be estimated to z~4, where variations of dark energy and alternate gravity theories can be probed.”\n\"The AGN Hubble  The luminosity distance indicator τ is plotted as a function of redshift for 38 AGN with H lag measurements. On the right axis the luminosity distance and distance modulus (m-M) are shown using the surface brightness fluctuations distance to NGC3227 as a calibrator. The current best cosmology is plotted as a solid line. The line is not fit to the data but clearly follows the data well. Cosmologies with no dark energy components are plotted as dashed and dotted lines. The lower panel shows the logarithm of the ratio of the data compared to the current cosmology on the left axis, with the same values but in magnitudes on the right. The red arrow indicates the correction for internal extinction for NGC3516. The green arrow shows where NGC7469 would lie using the revised lag estimate. NGC7469 is our largest outlier and is believed to be an example of an object with a misidentified lag.\"\n“The scatter due to observational uncertainty can be reduced significantly. A major advantage held by AGN is that they can be observed repeatedly and the distance to any given object substantially refined.”\n“The ultimate limit of the accuracy of the method will rely on how the BLR (broad-line emitting region) responds to changes in the luminosity of the central source. The current tight radius-luminosity relationship indicates that the ionisation parameter and the gas density are both close to constant across our sample.”\n\n【4】 # Continua\nThe radio continuum from an active galactic nucleus is always due to a jet. It shows a spectrum characteristic of synchrotron radiation.\n\n【5】 # BL Lacertae objects\nA BL Lacertae object or BL Lac object is a type of active galaxy with an active galactic nucleus (AGN) and is named after its prototype, BL Lacertae. In contrast to other types of active galactic nuclei, BL Lacs are characterized by rapid and large-amplitude flux variability and significant optical polarization.\nAll known BL Lacs are associated with core dominated radio sources, many of them exhibiting superluminal motion.\nQSO B0323+022 is a BL Lacertae object. The image at right is taken with the ESO New Technology Telescope (NTT) using the R filter.\n\n【6】 # Relativistic jets\nIn the images at right are the effects of charged particles apparently moving six times the speed of light.\n\"We see almost a dozen clouds which appear to be moving out from the galaxy's center at between four and six times the speed of light. These are all located in a narrow  jet of gas streaming out from the region of the black hole at the galaxy's center\".\n\"We believe this apparent speed translates into an actual velocity just slightly below that of light itself.\"\n\"The speeds reported are two to three times faster than the fastest motions previously recorded in M87, the only nearby galaxy to show evidence for superluminal motion.\"\n\"This discovery goes a long way towards confirming that radio galaxies, quasars and exotic BL Lac objects are basically the same beast, powered by super massive black holes, and differ only in orientation with respect to the observer\".\n\"Here we have, for the first time, a fairly normal radio galaxy with both excellent evidence for a super-massive black hole, as well as superluminal jet speeds similar to those seen in distant quasars and BL Lac objects.\"\n\"This is the first time superluminal motion has been seen with any optical telescope, and this discovery was made possible by the extremely fine resolution obtained by Hubble\".\n\"The structure of relativistic jets in  AGN on scales of light days reveals how energy propagates through jets, a process that is fundamental to galaxy evolution.\"\nTheir lengths can reach several thousand or even hundreds of thousands of light years. The hypothesis is that the twisting of magnetic fields in the accretion disk collimates the outflow along the rotation axis of the central object, so that when conditions are sui, a jet will emerge from each face of the accretion disk. If the jet is oriented along the line of sight to Earth, relativistic beaming will change its apparent brightness. The mechanics behind both the creation of the jets and the composition of the jets are still a matter of much debate in the scientific community; it is hypothesized that the jets are composed of an electrically neutral mixture of electrons, positrons, and protons in some proportion.\nA relativistic jet emitted from the AGN of M87 is traveling at speeds between four and six times the speed of light.\n\"The term 'superluminal motion' is something of a misnomer.  While it accurately describes the speeds measured, scientists still believe the actual speed falls just below the speed of light.\"\n\"It's an illusion created by the finite speed of light and rapid motion\".\n\"Our present understanding is that this 'superluminal motion' occurs when these clouds move towards Earth at speeds very close to that of light, in this case, more than 98 percent of the speed of light.  At these speeds the clouds nearly keep pace with the light they emit as they move towards Earth, so when the light finally reaches us, the motion appears much more rapid than the speed of light. Since the moving clouds travel slightly slower than the speed of light, they do not actually violate Einstein's theory of relativity which sets light as the speed limit.\"\n\n【7】 # Theoretical active galactic nuclei\nDef. a \"compact region at the center of a galaxy that has a much higher than normal luminosity over at least some portion, and possibly all, of the electromagnetic spectrum\" is called an active galactic nucleus.\nDef. a \"structure formed by matter falling into a gravitational source such as a galaxy, black hole, or protostar\" is called an accretion disk or accretion disc.\n\n【8】 # Cosmic rays\nAt right is an image indicating the range of cosmic-ray energies. The flux for the lowest energies (yellow zone) is mainly attributed to solar cosmic rays, intermediate energies (blue) to galactic cosmic rays, and highest energies (purple) to extragalactic cosmic rays.\nThere is \"a correlation between the arrival directions of cosmic rays with energy above 6 x 1019 electron volts and the positions of active galactic nuclei (AGN) lying within ~75 megaparsecs.\"\n\n【9】 # Neutrons\n\"Due to nγ collisions of the ultrarelativistic neutrons with the submillimeter-IR photons, the neutrons with Lorentz factors Γ > Γesc  should degrade in the region r ≤ rmx responsible for the low-frequency radiation of  AGN.\"\n\n【10】 # Gamma rays\nIn March 2010 it was announced that active galactic nuclei are not responsible for most gamma-ray background radiation. Though active galactic nuclei do produce some of the gamma-ray radiation detected here on Earth, less than 30% originates from these sources. The search now is to locate the sources for the remaining 70% or so of all gamma-rays detected. Possibilities include star forming galaxies, galactic mergers, and yet-to-be explained dark matter interactions.\nMost gamma-ray emitting sources are actually gamma-ray bursts, objects which only produce gamma radiation for a few milliseconds to thousands of seconds before fading away. Only 10% of gamma-ray sources are non-transient sources. These steady gamma-ray emitters include pulsars, neutron stars, and black hole candidates such as active galactic nuclei.\n\n【11】 # X-rays\n\"odels in which γ-rays are absorbed in collisions with X-rays producing nonthermal electron-positron pairs, which in turn radiate further X-rays .\"\n\"he reprocessing of radiation by e+ e- pairs could be a sufficiently robust mechanism to yield the canonical spectrum, independent of the details of the particle acceleration mechanism and the parameters of the source, such as the X- and γ-ray luminosity, L, and the size, R.\"\n\"he hard X-ray spectrum of a growing number of  AGN  the 1-30 keV X-ray emission has four distinct components\":\n- \"an incident power law spectrum with a spectral index αix ≃ 0.9,\"\n- \"an emission line at the energy ~6.4 keV (interpreted as a fluorescent iron K-line),\"\n- \"an absorption edge at 7-8 keV (interpreted as an iron K-edge), and\"\n- \"a broad excess of emission with respect to the underlying power law at energies ≳ 10 keV (interpreted as Compton reflection from cold  material).\" \n\n【12】 # Super soft X-rays\nSupersoft active galactic nuclei reach luminosities up to 1045 erg/s.\n\n【13】 # Reds\n\"The combination of X-ray absorption, red near-IR continuum, polarized optical continuum, and broad lines in the majority of 2MASS  AGNs suggests that they are viewed at an intermediate line of sight with respect to dusty, nuclear material (e.g., torus/disk/wind), as has been proposed for the similarly polarized  BAL  QSOs.\"\n\n【14】 # Superluminals\nFor active galactic nuclei (AGNs) \"bright jet features typically exhibit apparent superluminal speeds and accelerated motions.\"\nAGN \"jets with the fastest superluminal speeds all tend to have high Doppler boosted radio luminosities.  there is a correlation between intrinsic jet speed and intrinsic (de-beamed) luminosity\".\nThe AGN showing superluminal motion in B1950 are\n- 0003+380 S4 0003+38 J0006.1+3821 z=0.229 quasar\n- 0003-066 NRAO 005 \\. z=0.3467 BL Lac\n- 0007+106 III Zw 2 \\. z=0.0893 radio galaxy\n- 0010+405 4C +40.01 \\. z=0.256 quasar\n- 0015-054 PMN J0017-0512 J0017.6-0510 z=0.226 quasar\n- 0016+731 S5 0016+73 ··· z=1.781 quasar\n- 0048-097 PKS 0048-09 J0050.6-0929 z=0.635 BL Lac\n- 0055+300 NGC 315 ··· z=0.0165 radio galaxy\n- 0059+581 TXS 0059+581 J0102.7+5827 z=0.644 quasar\n- 0106+013 4C +01.02 J0108.6+0135 z=2.099 quasar\n- 0109+224 S2 0109+22 J0112.1+2245 z=0.265 BL Lac\n- 0109+351 B2 0109+35 ··· z=0.450 quasar\n- 0110+318 4C +31.03 J0112.8+3208 z=0.603 quasar\n- 0111+021 UGC 00773 ··· z=0.047 BL Lac\n- 0116-219 OC -228 J0118.8-2142 z=1.165 quasar.\n From its movement as it was leaving its source in µas y-1, S4 0003+38 before it left its source was moving at 2.62±0.84c, left its source at a back projected date of 2003.01±0.24, continued accelerating to 4.63±0.32c, then began to decelerate successively at each observation epoch from 0.67±0.20, 0.36±0.32, to 0.16±0.26.\nThe second image at right is of apparent superluminal motion in NGC 315.

The picture shows the variable parsec-scale structure of the jet in this active galactic nucleus. The features observed correspond to ejected plasma regions traveling at relativistic speeds. Those appear to be larger than the speed of light due to projection effects. The sixteen images are spaced by their relative time intervals. The images show that a major radio flux-density outburst in 1996 was followed by a particularly bright plasma ejection associated with a superluminal jet component. This major event was followed by trailing features in its evolution. A similar event is seen after mid 2001. The jet dynamics in this source is revealed: a plasma injection into the jet beam leads to the formation of multiple shocks that travel at different speeds downstream (ranging from 3c to 6c) and interact with each other and with the ambient medium. This is in agreement with numerical relativistic magnetohydrodynamic structural and emission simulations of jets.\"\n\"Images were taken at 15 GHz with the full Very Long Baseline Array as part of the 2cm Survey/MOJAVE collaboration. The observing runs usually last 8 hr and the total observing time on source is approximately 50 minutes. The typical dynamic range in the images is of 1000:1 (the lowest shown flux density is typically of 1-2 mJy/beam). The images are convolved with a common restoring beam of 0.5x1.0 milliarcseconds (P.A. of 0 deg). The image alignment is (arbitrary) to the brightness peak. The superluminal speeds of the features in the jet were determined from a detailed analysis of multiple Gaussian model fits to the observed visibilities.\"\n\n【15】 # Warm–hot intergalactic medium\nThe warm–hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) refers to a sparse, warm-to-hot (105 to 107 K) plasma that  exist in the spaces between galaxies and \\. contain 40–50% of the baryons (that is, 'normal matter' which exists as plasma or as atoms and molecules, in contrast to dark matter) in the universe at the current epoch. Because of the high temperature of the medium, it is more readily observed from the ultraviolet and low energy X-ray emission. This was detected in the 0.4–0.6 keV energy band as of 2010 using the orbiting XMM-Newton observatory. This emission forms 12% ± 5% of the diffuse X-ray background radiation.\nWithin the WHIM, gas shocks are created as a result of active galactic nuclei, along with the gravitationally-driven processes of merging and accretion. Part of the gravitational energy supplied by these effects is converted into thermal emissions of the matter by collisionless shock heating.\nIn May 2010 a giant reservoir of WHIM was detected by the Chandra X-ray Observatory lying along the wall shaped structure of galaxies (Sculptor Wall) some 400 million light-years from Earth.\n\"These computer simulations  show a swarm of dark matter clumps around our Milky Way galaxy. Some of the dark-matter concentrations are massive enough to spark star formation. Thousands of clumps of dark matter coexist with our Milky Way galaxy, shown in the center of the top panel. The green blobs in the middle panel are those dark-matter chunks massive enough to obtain gas from the intergalactic medium and trigger ongoing star formation, eventually creating dwarf galaxies. In the bottom panel, the red blobs are ultra-faint dwarf galaxies that stopped forming stars long ago.\"\n\n【16】 # Galaxies\n\n【17】 # Milky Way\n Due to its distance, and the fact that we see the orbit at a steep angle as the cloud falls towards the black hole, only the position, not the shape, of the cloud can be discerned in this image. The stretching of the cloud is seen in observations of its velocity, which allow astronomers to work out where on its orbit the different parts of the cloud are now located.\nThese observations show how a gas cloud  now passing close to the supermassive black hole at the centre of the galaxy is being ripped apart. The horizontal axis shows the extent of the cloud along its orbit and the vertical axis shows the velocities of different parts of the cloud. The cloud is now dramatically stretched out and the velocity of the front is several million km/h different from that of the tail.\nThese observations  from ESO’s Very Large Telescope, using the SINFONI instrument, show how a gas cloud is being stretched and ripped apart as it passes close to the supermassive black hole at the centre of the galaxy. The horizontal axis shows the extent of the cloud along its orbit and the vertical axis shows the velocities of different parts of the cloud during the last ten years. The cloud is now  dramatically stretched out and the velocity of the front is several million km/h different from that of the tail.\n\n【18】 # NGC 507\n known as rp 229, CGCG 502-67, MCG 5-4-44, PGC 5098, UGC 938, and V V 207, is a lenticular galaxy in the constellation Pisces. It was described as being \"very faint\", \"pretty large\", \"round\", \"brighter in the middle\", and \"south of NGC 508\" by John Louis Emil Dreyer in the New General Catalogue. It was discovered by William Herschel on September 12, 1784.\n allowed an estimate of the power required to produce the bubbles, which are each about 10,000 light years in diameter. Surprisingly, the analysis indicates that most of the energy released by the infalling gas goes into producing jets of high-energy particles that create the huge bubbles, rather than into an outpouring of light as observed in many active galactic nuclei.\n\n【19】 # NGC 1097\nAt right is a \"olour-composite image of the central 5,500 light-years wide region of the spiral galaxy NGC 1097 , obtained with the NACO adaptive optics on the VLT.

The galaxy has an angular extent of 3.3 '× 2.1', an apparent brightness of +11.2 mag. It is about 180 million light years away from the solar system and has a diameter of about 215,000 light years. It has an active galactic nucleus.\n\n【21】 # NGC 3393\n\"I'm still on a roll with the active galactic nuclei (AGN) and here is the latest, with thanks to Mitchell Revalski for the list of interesting objects to investigate. I had the usual trouble with this one trying to balance the colors while making the illuminated filaments easy to discern. In many galaxies, the details near the nucleus are not so important to convey, and it is therefore ok if it's all a bright ball. Here, the image is quite dark to accommodate the details in the core.\"\n\"We're quite used to seeing spiral galaxies with uniformly yellowish cores full of old stars, so when something blue or green is spotted, it seems a bit odd, and that's one of the ways astronomers can find these fascinating galaxies.

Spectroscopy is kind of like a fingerprint in light, and whatever spikes and dips in the graph appear tell a story about how far the light traveled, what elements are present, and what's happening to those elements.\"\n tell us this?

To begin with, it is a pure-disc galaxy. Like other spirals, it has a flat disc permeated by dark lanes of material and with prominent spiral arms where young stars are forming in clusters (the blue dots seen in the image). But while most spiral galaxies have a central bulge — a large group of old stars packed in a compact, spheroidal region — NGC 3621 doesn’t. In this image, it is clear that there is simply a brightening to the centre, but no actual bulge like the one in NGC 6744 (eso, for example.\n interesting as it is believed to have an active supermassive black hole at its centre that is engulfing matter and producing radiation. This is somewhat unusual because most of these so-called active galactic nuclei exist in galaxies with prominent bulges.

NGC 5548 is approximately 245 million light years away and appears in the constellation Boötes. This galaxy was studied by the Multicolor Active Galactic Nuclei Monitoring 2 m telescope.\nBy the galaxy morphological classification, this is an unbarred lenticular galaxy with tightly-wound spiral arms, while shell and tidal tail features suggest that it has undergone a cosmologically-recent merger or interaction event.\nObservation of NGC 5548 during the 1960s with radio telescopes showed an enhanced level of radio emission. Spectrograms of the nucleus made in 1966 showed that the energized region was confined to a volume a few parsecs across, where temperature were around 14000 K and the plasma had a dispersion velocity of ±450 km/s.\nThere is \"a clumpy gas stream flowing quickly outwards and blocking 90 percent of the X-rays emitted by the black hole. This activity could provide insights into how supermassive black holes interact with their host galaxies.\"\n\"The discovery of the unusual behaviour in NGC 5548 is the result of an intensive observing campaign using major ESA and NASA space observatories: ESA’s X-ray Multi-Mirror Mission (XMM-Newton), the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, NASA’s Swift, NASA’s Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR), NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory, and ESA's International Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory (INTEGRAL).\"\n\"An active galaxy is a galaxy which hosts an active galactic nucleus (AGN). An AGN is a compact region at the centre of a galaxy that has a much higher than normal luminosity. The high level of radiation, sometimes across the whole of the electromagnetic spectrum, is thought to be a result the supermassive black hole at the centre pulling in mass from the surroundings.\"\n\"There are other galaxies that show gas streams near a black hole, but this is the first time that a stream like this has been seen to move into the line of sight.\"\n\"This is the first direct evidence for the long-predicted shielding process that is needed to accelerate powerful gas streams, or winds, to high speeds.\"\n\"We were very lucky. You don’t normally see this kind of event with objects like this. It tells us more about the powerful ionised winds that allow supermassive black holes in the nuclei of active galaxies to expel large amounts of matter. In larger quasars than NGC 5548, these winds can regulate the growth of both the black hole and its host galaxy.\"\n\"As matter spirals down into a black hole it forms a flat disc, known as an accretion disc. The disc is heated so much that it emits X-rays, near to the black hole, and less energetic ultraviolet radiation further out. The ultraviolet radiation can create winds strong enough to blow gas away from the black hole, which otherwise would have fallen into it. But, the winds only come into existence if their starting point is shielded from X-rays.\"\n\"Earlier observations had seen the effects of both X-rays and ultraviolet radiation on a region of warm gas for away from the black hole, but these most recent observations have shown the presence of a new gas stream between the disc and the original cloud. The newly discovered gas stream in the archetypal Seyfert galaxy NGC 5548 — one of the best-studied sources of this type over the past half-century — absorbs most of the X-ray radiation before it reaches the original cloud, shielding it from X-rays and leaving only the ultraviolet radiation. The same stream shields gas closer to the accretion disc. This makes the strong winds possible, and it appears that the shielding has been going on for at least three years.\"\n“There were dramatic changes since the last observation with Hubble in 2011. We saw signatures of much colder gas than was present before, indicating that the wind had cooled down, due to a strong decrease in the ionising X-ray radiation from the nucleus.\"\n\"NGC 5548’s persistent wind, which has been known about for two decades, reaches velocities exceeding 3.5 million kilometres per hour. But, a new wind has arisen which is much stronger and faster than the persistent wind.\"\n\"The new wind reaches speeds of up to 18 million kilometres per hour, but is much closer to the nucleus than the persistent wind. The new gas outflow blocks 90 percent of the low-energy X-rays that come from very close to the black hole, and it obscures up to a third of the region that emits the ultraviolet radiation at a distance of a few light-days from the black hole.\"\n\"Strong X-ray absorption by ionised gas has been seen in several other sources, and it has been attributed for instance to passing clouds.\"\n\"However, in our case, thanks to the combined XMM-Newton and Hubble data, we know this is a fast stream of outflowing gas very close to the nucleus\"\n\"It may even originate from the accretion disc.\"\n\n【27】 # UGC 6093\nUGC 6093 is classified as an active galaxy, which means that it hosts an active galactic nucleus.\n\"This image, captured by the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope’s Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC, shows a galaxy named UGC 6093. As can be easily seen, UGC 6093 is something known as a barred spiral galaxy — it has beautiful arms that swirl outwards from a bar slicing through the galaxy’s centre. It is classified as an active galaxy, which means that it hosts an active galactic nucleus, or AGN: a compact region at a galaxy’s centre within which material is dragged towards a supermassive black hole. As this black hole devours the surrounding matter it emits intense radiation, causing it to shine brightly.\"\n\"But UGC 6093 is more exotic still. The galaxy essentially acts as a giant astronomical laser that spews out light at microwave, not visible, wavelengths — this type of object is dubbed a megamaser (maser being the term for a microwave laser). Megamasers such as UGC 6093 can be some 100 million times brighter than masers found in galaxies like the Milky Way.\"\n\"Hubble’s WFC3 observes light spanning a range wavelengths — from the near-infrared, through the visible range, to the near-ultraviolet. It has two channels that detect and process different light, allowing astronomers to study a remarkable range of astrophysical phenomena; for example, the UV-visible channel can study galaxies undergoing massive star formation, while the near-infrared channel can study redshifted light from galaxies in the distant Universe. Such multi-band imaging makes Hubble invaluable in studying megamaser galaxies, as it is able to untangle their intriguing complexity.\"\n\n【28】 # IC 4970\n\"This composite image of data from three different telescopes shows an ongoing collision between two galaxies, NGC 6872 and IC 4970. X-ray data from NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory is shown in purple, while Spitzer Space Telescope's infrared data is red and optical data from ESO's Very Large Telescope (VLT) is colored red, green and blue.\"\n\"Astronomers think that supermassive black holes exist at the center of most galaxies. Not only do the galaxies and black holes seem to co-exist, they are apparently inextricably linked in their evolution. To better understand this symbiotic relationship, scientists have turned to rapidly growing black holes -- so-called active galactic nucleus (AGN) -- to study how they are affected by their galactic environments.\"\n\"The latest data from Chandra and Spitzer show that IC 4970, the small galaxy at the top of the image, contains an AGN, but one that is heavily cocooned in gas and dust. This means in optical light telescopes, like the VLT, there is little to see. X-rays and infrared light, however, can penetrate this veil of material and reveal the light show that is generated as material heats up before falling onto the black hole n as a bright point-like source).\"\n\"Despite this obscuring gas and dust around IC 4970, the Chandra data suggest that there is not enough hot gas in IC 4970 to fuel the growth of the AGN. Where, then, does the food supply for this black hole come from? The answer lies with its partner galaxy, NGC 6872. These two galaxies are in the process of undergoing a collision, and the gravitational attraction from IC 4970 has likely pulled over some of NGC 6872's deep reservoir of cold gas n prominently in the Spitzer data), providing a new fuel supply to power the giant black hole.\"\n\n【29】 # 3C 279\n one of the brightest and most variable sources in the gamma ray sky monitored by the Fermi Space Telescope.\nApparent superluminal motion was detected during observations first made in 1973 in a jet of material departing from the quasar.\nIn the second image down on the right, (a) is validation of Continuous High-Resolution Image Reconstruction Using Patch Priors (CHIRP) on data from the Boston University Blazar Group demonstrating superresolution  and (b) is a comparison of CHIRP (trained on natural images) and BiSpectrum Maximum Entropy Method (BSMEM) on reconstructing a black hole model image (courtesy A. Broderick) from simulated data.\n\n【30】 # MCG+01-38-005\n\"Phenomena across the universe emit radiation spanning the entire electromagnetic spectrum — from high-energy gamma rays, which stream out from the most energetic events in the cosmos, to lower-energy microwaves and radio waves.\"\n\"Microwaves, the very same radiation that can heat up your dinner, are produced by a multitude of astrophysical sources, including strong emitters known as masers (microwave lasers), even stronger emitters with the somewhat villainous name of megamasers, and the centers of some galaxies. Especially intense and luminous galactic centers are known as active galactic nuclei. They are in turn thought to be driven by the presence of supermassive black holes, which drag surrounding material inwards and spit out bright jets and radiation as they do so.\"\n\"The two galaxies shown here, imaged by the Hubble Space Telescope, are named MCG+01-38-004 (the upper, red-tinted one) and MCG+01-38-005 (the lower, blue-tinted one). MCG+01-38-005 is a special kind of megamaser; the galaxy’s active galactic nucleus pumps out huge amounts of energy, which stimulates clouds of surrounding water. Water’s constituent atoms of hydrogen and oxygen are able to absorb some of this energy and re-emit it at specific wavelengths, one of which falls within the microwave regime. MCG+01-38-005 is thus known as a water megamaser!\"\n\"Astronomers can use such objects to probe the fundamental properties of the universe. The microwave emissions from MCG+01-38-005 were used to calculate a refined value for the Hubble constant, a measure of how fast the universe is expanding. This constant is named after the astronomer whose observations were responsible for the discovery of the expanding universe and after whom the Hubble Space Telescope was named, Edwin Hubble.\"\n\n【31】 # Circinus galaxy\n\"Resembling a swirling witch's cauldron of glowing vapors, the black hole-powered core of a nearby active galaxy appears in this colorful NASA Hubble Space Telescope image. The galaxy lies 13 million light-years away in the southern constellation Circinus.\"\n\"This galaxy is designated a type 2 Seyfert, a class of mostly spiral galaxies that have compact centers and are believed to contain massive black holes. Seyfert galaxies are themselves part of a larger class of objects called Active Galactic Nuclei or AGN. AGN have the ability to remove gas from the centers of their galaxies by blowing it out into space at phenomenal speeds. Astronomers studying the Circinus galaxy are seeing evidence of a powerful AGN at the center of this galaxy as well.\"\n\"Much of the gas in the disk of the Circinus spiral is concentrated in two specific rings - a larger one of diameter 1,300 light-years, which has already been observed by ground-based telescopes, and a previously unseen ring of diameter 260 light-years.\"\n\"In the Hubble image, the smaller inner ring is located on the inside of the green disk. The larger outer ring extends off the image and is in the plane of the galaxy's disk. Both rings are home to large amounts of gas and dust as well as areas of major \"starburst\" activity, where new stars are rapidly forming on timescales of 40 - 150 million years, much shorter than the age of the entire galaxy.\"\n\"At the center of the starburst rings is the Seyfert nucleus, the believed signature of a supermassive black hole that is accreting surrounding gas and dust. The black hole and its accretion disk are expelling gas out of the galaxy's disk and into its halo (the region above and below the disk). The detailed structure of this gas is seen as magenta-colored streamers extending towards the top of the image.\"\n\"In the center of the galaxy and within the inner starburst ring is a V-shaped structure of gas. The structure appears whitish-pink in this composite image, made up of four filters. Two filters capture the narrow lines from atomic transitions in oxygen and hydrogen; two wider filters detect green and near-infrared light. In the narrow-band filters, the V-shaped structure is very pronounced. This region, which is the projection of a three-dimensional cone extending from the nucleus to the galaxy's halo, contains gas that has been heated by radiation emitted by the accreting black hole. A \"counter-cone,\" believed to be present, is obscured from view by dust in the galaxy's disk. Ultraviolet radiation emerging from the central source excites nearby gas causing it to glow. The excited gas is beamed into the oppositely directed cones like two giant searchlights.\"\n\"\n\n【32】 # Hickson Compact Group 59\n see many apparently smaller, probably more distant, galaxies visible in the background. Hickson groups display many peculiarities, often emitting in the radio and infrared and featuring active star-forming regions. In addition their galaxies frequently contain Active Galactic Nuclei powered by supermassive black holes, as well large quantities of dark matter.\"\n\"The NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope's Advanced Camera for Surveys, using the Wide Field Channel, captured this image of HCG059 in 2007. The picture was created from images taken through blue, yellow and near-infrared filters (F435W, F606W and F814W). The total exposure times per filter were 57 minutes, 41 minutes and 35 minutes respectively. The field of view is about 3.4 arcminutes across.\"\n\n【33】 # Galactic mergers\n\"A team of astronomers studied over 1400 galaxies snapped by Hubble in the COSMOS survey, to test the hypothesis that galactic mergers trigger active galactic nuclei (AGN). In order to make this a blind test, the team modelled and removed the active nucleus (which normally appears as a bright spot) from each galaxy, and then cosmetically added a similar mark to the galaxies without an AGN, to make them visually indistinguishable. This explains the black dot visible near the centre of each of these images.\"\n\"They then categorised the galaxies, according to whether they showed no sign of recent mergers (top), minor signs (middle row) or clear signs of disruption from a recent merger (bottom).\"\n\"Analysing these results, they found that galaxies with active nuclei (left) and those with inactive nuclei (right) showed no statistically significant difference in the proportion that had undergone mergers. This means that processes other than galactic mergers must trigger AGN activity.\"\nThe Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS) is a Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Treasury Project to survey a two square degree equatorial field with the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS). The largest survey ever undertaken by HST, the project incorporates commitments from observatories around the world, such as the Very Large Array radio observatory, the European Space Agency's XMM-Newton satellite, and Japan's eight meter Subaru telescope. At the moment, more than 150 astronomers around the world actively contribute to the project.\nThe project's primary goal is to study the relationship between large scale structure (LSS) in the universe and dark matter, the formation of galaxies, and nuclear activity in galaxies. This includes careful analysis of the dependence of galaxy evolution on environment. The survey covers 2 square degrees of  sky in the constellation Sextans.\n\n【34】 # SDSSJ0150+2725\n\"Though the bright, light-speckled foreground galaxy on the left is eye-catching, it is far from the most intriguing object in this NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope image. In the upper part of the frame, the light from distant galaxies has been smeared and twisted into odd shapes, arcs, and streaks. This phenomenon indicates the presence of a giant galaxy cluster, which is bending the light coming from the galaxies behind it with its monstrous gravitational influence.\"\n\"This cluster, called SDSSJ0150+2725, lies some three billion light-years away and was first documented by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), hence its name. The SDSS uses a 2.5-metre optical telescope located at the Apache Point Observatory in New Mexico to observe millions of objects and create detailed 3D maps of the Universe. This particular cluster was part of the Sloan Giant Arcs Survey (SGAS), which detected galaxy clusters with strong lensing properties; their gravity stretches and warps the light of more distant galaxies sitting behind them, creating weird and spectacular arcs such as those seen here.\"\n emit strong radio signals thought to be from active galactic nuclei (AGN) at their centers, suggesting that the activity from both the AGN and any ongoing star formation is fuelled by cold gas found within the host galaxies.\"\n\n【35】 # SDSS J1336-0331\n\"At first glance, it may seem as though this image was taken through a faulty lens, but the mind-bending distortions visible in this Hubble Wide Field Camera 3 impressive image are actually caused by a cosmic phenomenon.\"\n\"The bright object at the centre of the frame is the galaxy cluster SDSS J1336-0331. The enormous gravitational influence of the cluster warps the very shape and fabric of its environment (the spacetime around it) creating an effect known as strong gravitational lensing. Through this the light from background galaxies in the line of sight to the observer are bent into fantastic arcs. This effect is very useful for studying distant background galaxies.\"\n showed that star formation in older BCGs no longer significantly contributes to the galaxy’s growth; instead, the stellar growth occurs through mergers, the collision of two galaxies. Violent, gas-rich major mergers can trigger intense bursts of star formation in their aftermath.\"\n\n【36】 # SDSS J1354+1327\n\"Researchers using a suite of telescopes including the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope have spotted a supermassive black hole blowing huge bubbles of hot, bright gas — one bubble is currently expanding outwards from the black hole, while another older bubble slowly fades away. This cosmic behemoth sits within the galaxy at the bottom of this image, which lies 900 million light-years from Earth and is known as SDSS J1354+1327. The upper, larger, galaxy is known as SDSS J1354+1328.\"\n\"Supermassive which can have a mass equivalent to billions of suns, are found in the centre of most galaxies (including the Milky Way). These black holes are able to “feed” on their surroundings, causing them to shine brilliantly as Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). However, this feeding process is not continuous as it depends on how much matter is available for the black hole to consume; if the surrounding material is clumpy and irregular, an AGN can be seen turning “off” and “on”, and flickering over long cosmic timescales.\"\n\"This clumpy accretion is what scientists believe has happened with the black hole in SDSS J1354+1327. Scientists believe these two outflows of material are the result of the black hole burping out material after two different feeding events. The first outburst created the fading southern relic: a cone of gas measuring 33 000 light-years across. Around 100 000 years later, a second burst spawned the more compact and radiant outflow emanating from the top of the galaxy: a cone of shocked gas some 3300 light-years across.\"\n\n【37】 # Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey\n\"More than 12 billion years of cosmic history are shown in this unprecedented, panoramic, full-color view of thousands of galaxies in various stages of assembly.\"\n\"This image, taken by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope, was made from mosaics taken in September and October 2009 with the newly installed Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC and in 2004 with the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS). The view covers a portion of the southern field of a large galaxy census called the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS), a deep-sky study by several observatories to trace the formation and evolution of galaxies.\"\n\"The final image combines a broad range of colors, from the ultraviolet, through visible light, and into the near-infrared. Such a detailed multi-color view of the universe has never before been assembled in such a combination of color, clarity, accuracy, and depth.\"\n\"Hubble's sharp resolution and new color versatility, produced by combining data from the two cameras, are allowing astronomers to sort out the various stages of galaxy formation. The image reveals galaxy shapes that appear increasingly chaotic at each earlier epoch, as galaxies grew through accretion, collisions, and mergers. The galaxies range from the mature spirals and ellipticals in the foreground, to smaller, fainter, irregularly shaped galaxies, most of which are farther away, and therefore existed farther back in time. These smaller galaxies are considered the building blocks of the larger galaxies we see today.\"\n\"Astronomers are using this multi-color panorama to trace many details of galaxy assembly over cosmic time, including the star-formation rate in galaxies, the rate of mergers among galaxies, and the abundance of weak active galactic nuclei.\"\n\"The image shows a rich tapestry of 7,500 galaxies stretching back through most of the universe's history. The closest galaxies seen in the foreground emitted their observed light about a billion years ago. The farthest galaxies, a few of the very faint red specks, are seen as they appeared more than 13 billion years ago, or roughly 650 million years after the Big Bang. This mosaic spans a slice of space that is equal to about a third of the diameter of the full Moon (10 arcminutes).\"\n\"The new Hubble view highlights a wide variety of stages in the galaxy assembly process. Ultraviolet light taken by WFC3 shows the blue glow of hot, young stars in galaxies teeming with star birth. The orange light reveals the final buildup of massive galaxies about 8 billion to 10 billion years ago. The near-infrared light displays the red glow of very distant galaxies – in a few cases as far as 12 billion to 13 billion light-years away – whose light has been stretched, like a toy Slinky, from ultraviolet light to longer-wavelength infrared light due to the expansion of the universe.\"\n\"In this ambitious use of Hubble's observing time, astronomers used 96 Hubble orbits to make the ACS optical observations of this slice of the GOODS field and 104 orbits to make the WFC3 ultraviolet and near-infrared exposures. WFC3 peered deeper into the universe in this study than comparable near-infrared observations from ground-based telescopes. This set of unique new Hubble observations reveals galaxies to about 27th magnitude in brightness over a factor of 10 in wavelength. That's over 250 million times fainter than the unaided eye can see in visual light from a dark ground-based site.\"\n\n【38】 # Wisconsinian glacial\nWisconsinian glacial began at 80,000 yr BP.\nThe \"emission phenomena observed in active galactic nuclei  the production of compact radio sources separating at superluminal speeds\".\nOutbursts \"of cosmic ray electrons from the Galactic Center  penetrate the Galaxy relatively undamped and  to have a major impact on the Solar System through their ability to vaporize and inject cometary material into the interplanetary environment.  such 'superwave', passing through the Solar System toward the end of the Last Ice Age,  responsible for producing major changes in the Earth's climate and for indirectly precipitating the terminal Pleistocene extinction episode.

These galaxies contain active galactic nuclei, or quasars, in their centers. These are luminous objects powered by the rapid growth of supermassive black holes. The obscured quasars show much higher levels of high-energy X-ray emission because the less energetic X-rays are mostly absorbed by gas.\"\n\n【41】 # EXOSAT\nThe European X-ray Observatory Satellite (EXOSAT), originally named HELOS, was an X-ray telescope operational from May 1983 until April 1986 and in that time made 1780 observations in the X-ray band of most classes of astronomical object including active galactic nuclei, stellar coronae, cataclysmic variables, white dwarfs, X-ray binaries, clusters of galaxies, and supernova remnants.\n The instrumentation includes two low-energy imaging telescopes (LEIT) with Wolter I X-ray optics (for the 0.04-2 keV energy range), a medium-energy experiment using Ar/CO2 and Xe/CO2 detectors (for 1.5-50 keV), a Xe/He gas scintillation spectrometer (GSPC) (covering 2-80 keV), and a reprogrammable onboard data-processing computer. Exosat was capable of observing an object (in the direct-pointing mode) for up to 80 hours and of locating sources to within at least 10 arcsec with the LEIT and about 2 arcsec with GSPC.\n\"Thirty-four years ago, on 26 May 1983, ESA’s Exosat satellite was launched by a Thor-Delta rocket from Vandenburg Airforce Base, California, USA, and was taken over by mission controllers at ESOC, the European Space Operations Centre, Darmstadt, Germany.\"\n\"Designed to observe and detect high-energy sources, Exosat was the first ESA mission to study the Universe at X-ray wavelengths, and one of the first uncrewed satellites to feature an on-board computer.\"\n\"By placing the satellite in an elliptical orbit, mission teams were able to operate the instruments for 76 hours of each revolution.\"\n\"In its three-year life, the mission observed a wide variety of objects, including active galactic nuclei, X-ray binary systems, supernova remnants and clusters of galaxies.\"\n\"The results that Exosat obtained were very useful to scientists, and led to several new discoveries. The most important of these was probably the discovery of quasi-periodic oscillations in low-mass X-ray binary stars and X-ray pulsars, a phenomenon unknown before Exosat.

To the right of the water tanks is the ESO New Technology Telescope (NTT), which had its first light on 23 March 1989. This 3.58-metre telescope was the first ever to have a computer-controlled main mirror, which could adjust its shape during observations to optimise image quality. The octagonal enclosure housing the NTT is another technological breakthrough, ventilated by a system of flaps that makes air flow smoothly across the mirror, reducing turbulence and leading to sharper images.\n observes variable stars, gamma-ray bursts and active galactic nuclei.\nIn the foreground on the right is a building nicknamed the sarcofago (sarcophagus). This houses the TAROT (Télescope à Action Rapide pour les Objets Transitoires, or Rapid Action Telescope for Transient Objects), which started work at La Silla on 15 September 2006.\n\n【44】 # Tuorla Observatory\nTuorla is located about 12 kilometres from Turku in the direction of Helsinki. The observatory is at an altitude of 60.6 m above sea level (asl).\nA new observatory was needed because the old Iso-Heikkilä Observatory close to the centre of Turku started suffering heavy light pollution from nearby city and especially industrial areas to the south of the observatory. A new place was found in Tuorla, which is one of the small villages in (former) Piikkiö municipality.\n international telescopes like the Nordic Optical Telescope are in use. The one meter Dall-Kirkham reflector  is the largest optical telescope in Finland.\nThe main area of research in Tuorla is active galactic nuclei; about half of the researchers are working on the topic. Other areas are dark matter, cosmology, astrodynamics, binary stars, solar neighborhood, solar physics and astrobiology.

This treatment is said to work at the subtlest or \"quantum\" level of the individual.\n\n【3】 # Research on MVM\nThe National Institutes of Health, the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, and the National Center for Research Resources have funded research on the Transcendental Meditation program, which is considered an application of Maharishi Ayurveda.

It is an obligate parasite that can colonize the gastrointestinal tract resulting in the gastroenteritis and diarrhea characteristic of cryptosporidiosis.   Unlike C. parvum, which has a rather broad host range, C. hominis is almost exclusively a parasite of humans.   As a result, C. hominis has a low zoonotic potential compared to C. parvum.   It is spread through the fecal-oral route usually by drinking water contaminated with oocyst laden feces. \n\n【2】 # Characteristics\nC. hominis shares many similar characteristics with C. parvum including identical oocyst morphology and life-cycle.  As a result, C. hominis is most easily differentiated from C. parvum through genetic analysis at specific loci. \nIn The Netherlands, C. hominis is responsible for an autumnal spike in cases of cryptosporidiosis, though reasons for this spike remain unclear. \n\n【3】 # Life cycle\nThe  life cycle of Cryptosporidium hominis is similar to that of others of the genus with infective sporozoites from ingested oocysts invading gut epithelium.  From there, they undergo merogony and generate merozoites which escape and can reinvade additional cells and form a secondary meront.  The secondary meront then releases secondary merozoites which reinvade and undergo gametogony forming micro and macrogametocytes.  The gametocytes can then fuse forming a zygote which starts the cycle again.\n\n【4】 # Treatment\nThough symptoms in most immunocompetent persons will resolve without treatment, Nitazoxanide has been approved for treatment of diarrhea resulting from cryptosporidiosis.  The effectiveness of Nitazoxanide in immunocompromised patients, however, is uncertain and current treatments revolve around boosting the host immune system to aid in symptom resolution.

Drugs of this type are generally well absorbed after ingestion.\nSigns and Symptoms:\n- The signs and symptoms of overdose of benzonatate have been reported within 15-20 minutes. If capsules are chewed or dissolved in the mouth, oropharyngeal anesthesia will develop rapidly, which may cause choking and airway compromise.\n- CNS stimulation may cause restlessness and tremors which may proceed to clonic convulsions followed by profound CNS depression. Convulsions, coma, cerebral edema and cardiac arrest leading to death have been reported within 1 hour of ingestion.\nTreatment:\n- In case of overdose, seek medical attention immediately. Evacuate gastric contents and administer copious amounts of activated charcoal slurry. Even in the conscious patient, cough and gag reflexes may be so depressed as to necessitate special attention to protection against aspiration of gastric contents and orally administered materials. Convulsions should be treated with a short-acting barbiturate given intravenously and carefully titrated for the smallest effective dosage. Intensive support of respiration and cardiovascular-renal function is an essential feature of the treatment of severe intoxication from overdosage.\n- Do not use CNS stimulants.\n\n【41】 # Pharmacology\n\n【42】 ## Mechanism of Action\n- Benzonatate acts peripherally by anesthetizing the stretch receptors located in the respiratory passages, lungs, and pleura by dampening their activity and thereby reducing the cough reflex at its source. It begins to act within 15 to 20 minutes and its effect lasts for 3 to 8 hours. Benzonatate has no inhibitory effect on the respiratory center in recommended dosage.\n\n【43】 ## Structure\n- Benzonatate, a non-narcotic oral antitussive agent, is 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, 26-nonaoxaoctacosan-28-yl p(butylamino) benzoate; with a molecular weight of 603.7.\n- Each soft gelatin capsule, for oral administration, contains 100 mg or 200 mg benzonatate USP.

Marston really wanted to develop a unit of measurement of 'mental energy'. He did not develop the DISC test or assessment. In fact, he never used it as an assessment at all. However, in 1930, a friend did use it as an assessment in a book on success and it was published as one of the first in the newly emerging field of Self-Help publications.\n\n【2】 # Method\nThe tests classify four aspects of behavior by testing a person's preferences in word associations (compare with Myers-Briggs Type Indicator). DISC is an acronym for:\n- Dominance - relating to control, power and assertiveness\n- Influence - relating to social situations and communication\n- Steadiness (submission in Marston's time)- relating to patience, persistence, and thoughtfulness\n- Conscientiousness (or caution, compliance in Marston's time) - relating to structure and organization\nThese four dimensions can be grouped in a grid with D and I sharing the top row and representing extroverted aspects of the personality, and C and S below representing introverted aspects. D and C then share the left column and represent task-focused aspects, and I and S share the right column and represent social aspects. In this matrix, the horizontal dimension represents a factor of \"Assertive\" or \"Passive\", while the vertical represents \"Open\" vs. \"Guarded\". \n- Dominance: People who score high in the intensity of the 'D' styles factor are very active in dealing with problems and challenges, while low D scores are people who want to do more research before committing to a decision. High \"D\" people are described as demanding, forceful, egocentric, strong willed, driving, determined, ambitious, aggressive, and pioneering. Low D scores describe those who are conservative, low keyed, cooperative, calculating, undemanding, cautious, mild, agreeable, modest and peaceful.\n- Influence: People with High I scores influence others through talking and activity and tend to be emotional. They are described as convincing, magnetic, political, enthusiastic, persuasive, warm, demonstrative, trusting, and optimistic. Those with Low I scores influence more by data and facts, and not with feelings. They are described as reflective, factual, calculating, skeptical, logical, suspicious, matter of fact, pessimistic, and critical.\n- Steadiness:(Submission in Marston's time): People with High S styles scores want a steady pace, security, and don't like sudden change. Low S intensity scores are those who like change and variety. High S persons are calm, relaxed, patient, possessive, predic, deliberate, s, consistent, and tend to be unemotional and poker faced. People with Low S scores are described as restless, demonstrative, impatient, eager, or even impulsive.\n- Conscientious: (Compliance in Marston's time): Persons with High C styles adhere to rules, regulations, and structure. They like to do quality work and do it right the first time. High C people are careful, cautious, exacting, neat, systematic, diplomatic, accurate, tactful. Those with Low C scores challenge the rules and want independence and are described as self-willed, stubborn, opinionated, unsystematic, arbitrary, and careless with details.\nA common general public misconception is that if one is described as having either a D, I, S, or C style that all people are simply categorized into one of four types. The 1970's work by Dr John Geier brought DISC into practical application with substantive research. The Geier research delineated the distinct differences of persons within the 4 factor styles with the advent of the Classical Pattern definitions. It was found that there are distinct differences between persons within each of the 4 style profiles. For example not all D's behave in the same way. The same is accurate for the other styles of behavior.\n\n【3】 # The Success Insights Wheel\nThe DISC styles have been broken down further into a colorful wheel divided into eight parts. The four core DISC types plus four blends with adjacent types are given names, with their brief descriptions:\n- Conductor - Core D - direct and results-oriented\n- Persuader - Core D, influenced I - optimistic and flexible\n- Promoter - Core I - verbal and trusting\n- Relater - Core I, influenced S - cooperative team player\n- Supporter - Core S - accommodating and persistent\n- Coordinator - Core S, influenced C - cautious and self-disciplined\n- Analyzer - Core C - precise and detail-oriented\n- Implementer - Core C, influenced D - creative and indecisive\nThe wheel consists of five concentric rings. The eight \"descriptive styles\" lie on the outer ring, numbered 1-8. The next three rings consist of 16 segments each, numbered from 9-24, 25-40 and 41-56 respectively, where you can have even further blended types such as a \"Conducting Persuader\" , or an Implementing Analyzer . The third ring in will consist of the same blends, but considered \"flexible\" types. The inner ring only has four quadrants, numbered 57-60, corresponding to the original pure types only. (In the sample reports given, nobody scores in these two inner rings).  The wheel plots both the person's Natural Style and Adapted Style.\n used with the PIAV \"Six Attitudes\". \n another version of the Insights wheel with different names.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Clinical studies have not been conducted in the pediatric population.\n\n【15】 ## Off-Label Use and Dosage (Pediatric)\n\n【16】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Estradiol patch in pediatric patients.\n\n【17】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Estradiol patch in pediatric patients.\n\n【18】 # Contraindications\nClimara is contraindicated in women with any of the following conditions:\n- Undiagnosed abnormal genital bleeding\n- Known, suspected, or history of breast cancer\n- Known or suspected estrogen-dependent neoplasia\n- Active DVT, PE, or a history of these conditions\n- Active arterial thromboembolic disease (for example, stroke and MI), or a history of these conditions\n- Known anaphylactic reaction or angioedema with Climara\n- Known liver impairment or disease\n- Known protein C, protein S, or antithrombin deficiency, or other known thrombophilic disorders\n- Known or suspected pregnancy\n\n【19】 # Warnings\nCardiovascular Disorders\n- An increased risk of stroke and DVT has been reported with estrogen-alone therapy. An increased risk of PE, DVT, stroke and MI has been reported with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Should any of these occur or be suspected, estrogen with or without progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately.\n- Risk factors for arterial vascular disease (for example, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, tobacco use, hypercholesterolemia, and obesity) and/or venous thromboembolism (VTE) (for example, personal history or family history of VTE, obesity, and systemic lupus erythematosus) should be managed appropriately.\nStroke\n- In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, a statistically significant increased risk of stroke was reported in women 50 to 79 years of age receiving daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone compared to women in the same age group receiving placebo (45 versus 33 per 10,000 women-years). The increase in risk was demonstrated in year 1 and persisted. Should a stroke occur or be suspected, estrogen-alone therapy should be discontinued immediately.\nSubgroup analyses of women 50 to 59 years of age suggest no increased risk of stroke for those women receiving CE (0.625 mg)-alone versus those receiving placebo (18 versus 21 per 10,000 women-years).1\nIn the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, a statistically significant increased risk of stroke was reported in women 50 to 79 years of age receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women in the same age group receiving placebo (33 versus 25 per 10,000 women years). The increase in risk was demonstrated after the first year and persisted.1 Should a stroke occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately.\nCoronary Heart Disease\n- In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, no overall effect on coronary heart disease (CHD) events (defined as nonfatal MI, silent MI, or CHD death) was reported in women receiving estrogen-alone compared to placebo2.\n- Subgroup analyses of women 50 to 59 years of age suggest a statistically non-significant reduction in CHD events (CE -alone compared to placebo) in women with less than 10 years since menopause (8 versus 16 per 10,000 women-years).1\n- In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, there was a statistically non-significant increased risk of CHD events reported in women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women receiving placebo (41 versus 34 per 10,000 women-years).1 An increase in relative risk was demonstrated in year 1, and a trend toward decreasing relative risk was reported in years 2 through 5.\n- In postmenopausal women with documented heart disease (n = 2,, average 66.7 years of age, in a controlled clinical trial of secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study ), treatment with daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) demonstrated no cardiovascular benefit. During an average follow-up of 4.1 years, treatment with CE plus MPA did not reduce the overall rate of CHD events in postmenopausal women with established coronary heart disease. There were more CHD events in the CE plus MPA-treated group than in the placebo group in year 1, but not during the subsequent years. A total of 2,321 women from the original HERS trial agreed to participate in an open label extension of HERS, HERS II. Average follow-up in HERS II was an additional 2.7 years, for a total of 6.8 years overall. Rates of CHD events were comparable among women in the CE plus MPA group and the placebo group in HERS, HERS II, and overall.\nVenous Thromboembolism\n- In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, the risk of VTE (DVT and PE) was increased for women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone compared to placebo (30 versus 22 per 10,000 women-years), although only the increased risk of DVT reached statistical significance (23 versus 15 per 10,000 women-years). The increase in VTE risk was demonstrated during the first 2 years3. Should a VTE occur or be suspected, estrogen-alone therapy should be discontinued immediately.\n demonstrated. The increase in VTE risk was demonstrated during the first year and persisted4. Should a VTE occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately.\n- If feasible, estrogens should be discontinued at least 4 to 6 weeks before surgery of the type associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, or during periods of prolonged immobilization.\nMalignant Neoplasms\nEndometrial Cancer:\n- An increased risk of endometrial cancer has been reported with the use of unopposed estrogen therapy in a woman with a uterus. The reported endometrial cancer risk among unopposed estrogen users is about 2 to 12 times greater than in non-users, and appears dependent on duration of treatment and on estrogen dose. Most studies show no significant increased risk associated with use of estrogens for less than 1 year. The greatest risk appears associated with prolonged use, with increased risks of 15- to 24-fold for 5 to 10 years or more. This risk has been shown to persist for at least 8 to 15 years after estrogen therapy is discontinued.\n- Clinical surveillance of all women using estrogen-alone or estrogen plus progestin therapy is important. Adequate diagnostic measures, including directed or random endometrial sampling when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in postmenopausal women with undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal genital bleeding.\n- There is no evidence that the use of natural estrogens results in a different endometrial risk profile than synthetic estrogens of equivalent estrogen dose. Adding a progestin to estrogen therapy in postmenopausal women has been shown to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer.\nBreast Cancer\n- The most important randomized clinical trial providing information about breast cancer in estrogen-alone users is the WHI substudy of daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone. In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, after an average follow-up of 7.1 years, daily CE-alone was not associated with an increased risk of invasive breast cancer (relative risk (RR) 0.5.\n- The most important randomized clinical trial providing information about breast cancer in estrogen plus progestin users is the WHI substudy of daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg). After a mean follow-up of 5.6 years, the estrogen plus progestin substudy reported an increased risk of invasive breast cancer in women who took daily CE plus MPA.\n- In this substudy, prior use of estrogen-alone or estrogen plus progestin therapy was reported by 26 percent of the women. The relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.24, and the absolute risk was 41 versus 33 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.86, and the absolute risk was 46 versus 25 cases per 10,000 women-years for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported no prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.09, and the absolute risk was 40 versus 36 cases per 10,000 women-years for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. In the same substudy, invasive breast cancers were larger, were more likely to be node positive, and were diagnosed at a more advanced stage in the CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) group compared with the placebo group. Metastatic disease was rare, with no apparent difference between the two groups. Other prognostic factors, such as histologic subtype, grade and hormone receptor status did not differ between the groups6.\n suggest that the risk of breast cancer was greater, and became apparent earlier, with estrogen plus progestin therapy as compared to estrogen-alone therapy. However, these studies have not generally found significant variation in the risk of breast cancer among different estrogen plus progestin combinations, doses, or routes of administration.\n- The use of estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin has been reported to result in an increase in abnormal mammograms requiring further evaluation.\n- All women should receive yearly breast examinations by a healthcare provider and perform monthly breast self-examinations. In addition, mammography examinations should be scheduled based on patient age, risk factors, and prior mammogram results.\nOvarian Cancer:\n- The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy reported a statistically non-significant increased risk of ovarian cancer. After an average follow-up of 5.6 years, the relative risk for ovarian cancer for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 1.58 (95 percent CI, 0.77-3.. The absolute risk for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 4 versus 3 cases per 10,000 women-years.7 In some epidemiological studies, the use of estrogen plus progestin and estrogen-only products, in particular for 5 or more years, has been associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer. However, the duration of exposure associated with increased risk is not consistent across all epidemiologic studies, and some report no association.\nProbable Dementia\n- In the WHIMS estrogen-alone ancillary study of WHI, a population of 2,947 hysterectomized women 65 to 79 years of age was randomized to daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone or placebo.\n- After an average follow-up of 5.2 years, 28 women in the estrogen-alone group and 19 women in the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia. The relative risk of probable dementia for CE-alone versus placebo was 1.49 (95 percent CI, 0.83-2.. The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE-alone versus placebo was 37 versus 25 cases per 10,000 women-years8.\n- In the WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study, a population of 4,532 postmenopausal women 65 to 79 years of age was randomized to daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) or placebo. After an average follow-up of 4 years, 40 women in the CE plus MPA group and 21 women in the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia.The relative risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 2.05 (95 percent CI, 1.21-3.. The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 45 versus 22 cases per 10,000 women-years8.\n- When data from the two populations in the WHIMS estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin ancillary studies were pooled as planned in the WHIMS protocol, the reported overall relative risk for probable dementia was 1.76 (95 percent CI, 1.19-2.. Since both ancillary studies were conducted in women 65 to 79 years of age, it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women8.\nGallbladder Disease\n- A 2- to 4-fold increase in the risk of gallbladder disease requiring surgery in postmenopausal women receiving estrogens has been reported.\nHypercalcemia\n- Estrogen administration may lead to severe hypercalcemia in women with breast cancer and bone metastases. If hypercalcemia occurs, use of the drug should be stopped and appropriate measures taken to reduce the serum calcium level.\nVisual Abnormalities\n- Retinal vascular thrombosis has been reported in women receiving estrogens. Discontinue medication pending examination if there is sudden partial or complete loss of vision, or a sudden onset of proptosis, diplopia, or migraine. If examination reveals papilledema or retinal vascular lesions, estrogens should be permanently discontinued.\nAddition of a Progestin When a Woman Has Not Had a Hysterectomy\n- Studies of the addition of a progestin for 10 or more days of a cycle of estrogen administration, or daily with estrogen in a continuous regimen, have reported a lowered incidence of endometrial hyperplasia than would be induced by estrogen treatment alone. Endometrial hyperplasia may be a precursor to endometrial cancer.\n- There are, however, possible risks that may be associated with the use of progestins with estrogens compared to estrogen-alone regimens. These include an increased risk of breast cancer.\nElevated Blood Pressure\n- In a small number of case reports, substantial increases in blood pressure have been attributed to idiosyncratic reactions to estrogens. In a large, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, a generalized effect of estrogens on blood pressure was not seen.\nHypertriglyceridemia\n- In women with pre-existing hypertriglyceridemia, estrogen therapy may be associated with elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis. Consider discontinuation of treatment if pancreatitis occurs.\nHepatic Impairment and/or Past History of Cholestatic Jaundice\n- Estrogens may be poorly metabolized in women with impaired liver function. For women with a history of cholestatic jaundice associated with past estrogen use or with pregnancy, caution should be exercised, and in the case of recurrence, medication should be discontinued.\nHypothyroidism\n receiving estrogens may require increased doses of their thyroid replacement therapy. These women should have their thyroid function monitored in order to maintain their free thyroid hormone levels in an acceprange.\nFluid Retention\n- Estrogens may cause some degree of fluid retention. Women with conditions that might be influenced by this factor, such as a cardiac or renal impairment, warrant careful observation when estrogen-alone is prescribed.\nHypocalcemia\n- Estrogen therapy should be used with caution in women with hypoparathyroidism as estrogen-induced hypocalcemia may occur.\nExacerbation of Endometriosis\n- A few cases of malignant transformation of residual endometrial implants have been reported in women treated post-hysterectomy with estrogen-alone therapy. For women known to have residual endometriosis post-hysterectomy, the addition of progestin should be considered.\nHereditary Angioedema\n- Exogenous estrogens may exacerbate symptoms of angioedema in women with hereditary angioedema.\nExacerbation of Other Conditions\n- Estrogen therapy may cause an exacerbation of asthma, diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, migraine, porphyria, systemic lupus erythematosus, and hepatic hemangiomas and should be used with caution in women with these conditions.\nLaboratory Tests\n- Serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol levels have not been shown to be useful in the management of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms and moderate to severe symptoms of vulvar and vaginal atrophy.\nDrug-Laboratory Test Interactions\n- Accelerated prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and platelet aggregation time; increased platelet count; increased factors II, VII antigen, VIII antigen, VIII coagulant activity, IX, X, XII, VII-X complex, II-VII-X complex, and beta-thromboglobulin; decreased levels of antifactor Xa and antithrombin III, decreased antithrombin III activity; increased levels of fibrinogen and fibrinogen activity; increased plasminogen antigen and activity.\n- Increased TBG levels leading to increased circulating total thyroid hormone, as measured by protein-bound iodine (PBI), T4 levels (by column or by radioimmunoassay) or T3 levels by radioimmunoassay. T3 resin uptake is decreased, reflecting the elevated TBG. Free T4 and free T3 concentrations are unaltered. Women on thyroid replacement therapy may require higher doses of thyroid hormone.\n- Other binding proteins may be elevated in serum, for example, corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), leading to increased total circulating corticosteroids and sex steroids, respectively. Free hormone concentrations, such as testosterone and estradiol, may be decreased. Other plasma proteins may be increased (angiotensinogen/renin substrate, alpha-l-antitrypsin, ceruloplasmin).\n- Increased plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and HDL2 cholesterol subfraction concentrations, reduced low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentration, and increased triglyceride levels.\n- Impaired glucose tolerance.\n\n【20】 # Adverse Reactions\n\n【21】 ## Clinical Trials Experience\n- Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.\n- The data described below reflect pooled data from 5 clinical trials of Climara. A total of 614 women were exposed to Climara for 3 months (193 women at 0.025 mg per day, 201 women at 0.05 mg per day, 194 women at 0.1 mg per day) in randomized, double-blind trials of clinical efficacy versus placebo and versus active comparator. All women were postmenopausal, had a serum estradiol level of less than 20 pg/mL, and a minimum of five moderate to severe hot flushes per week or a minimum of 15 hot flushes per week of any severity at baseline. Included in this are an additional 25 postmenopausal hysterectomized women exposed to Climara 0.025 mg per day for 6 to 24 months (N=16 at 24 months) in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of Climara for the prevention of osteoporosis.\n\n【22】 ## Postmarketing Experience\nThe following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of the Climara transdermal system. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.\n- Genitourinary System:\n- Changes in bleeding pattern, pelvic pain\n- Breast:\n- Breast cancer, breast pain, breast tenderness\n- Cardiovascular:\n- Changes in blood pressure, palpitations, hot flashes\n- Gastrointestinal:\n- Vomiting, abdominal pain, abdominal distension, nausea\n- Skin:\n- Alopecia, hyperhidrosis, night sweats, urticaria, rash\n- Eyes:\n- Visual disturbances, contact lens intolerance,\n- Central Nervous System:\n- Depression, migraine, paresthesia, dizziness, anxiety, irritability, mood swings, nervousness, insomnia, headache\n- Miscellaneous:\n- Fatigue, menopausal symptoms, weight increase, application site reaction, anaphylactic reactions\n\n【23】 # Drug Interactions\nMetabolic Interactions\n- In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that estrogens are metabolized partially by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A. Therefore, inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4 may affect estrogen drug metabolism. Inducers of CYP3A4 such as St. John’s wort (hypericum perforatum) preparations, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, and rifampin may reduce plasma concentrations of estrogens, possibly resulting in a decrease in therapeutic effects and/or changes in the uterine bleeding profile. Inhibitors of CYP3A4 such as erythromycin, clarithromycin, ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir and grapefruit juice may increase plasma concentrations of estrogens and may result in side effects.\n\n【24】 # Use in Specific Populations\n\n【25】 ### Pregnancy\nPregnancy Category (FDA):\n- Climara should not be used during pregnancy. There appears to be little or no increased risk of birth defects in children born to women who have used estrogens and progestins as oral contraceptives inadvertently during early pregnancy.\nPregnancy Category (AUS): \nThere is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Estradiol (transdermal) in women who are pregnant.\n\n【26】 ### Labor and Delivery\nThere is no FDA guidance on use of Estradiol (transdermal) during labor and delivery.\n\n【27】 ### Nursing Mothers\n- Climara should not be used during lactation. Estrogen administration to nursing women has been shown to decrease the quantity and quality of the breast milk. Detecamounts of estrogens have been identified in the breast milk of women receiving estrogen therapy. Caution should be exercised when the Climara transdermal system is administered to a nursing woman.\n\n【28】 ### Pediatric Use\n- Climara is not indicated in children. Clinical studies have not been conducted in the pediatric population.\n\n【29】 ### Geriatic Use\n- There have not been sufficient numbers of geriatric women involved in clinical studies utilizing Climara to determine whether those over 65 years of age differ from younger subjects in their response to Climara.\nThe Women’s Health Initiative Studies\n- In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy (daily CE -alone versus placebo), there was a higher relative risk of stroke in women greater than 65 years of age.\n- In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy (daily CE  plus MPA  versus placebo), there was a higher relative risk of nonfatal stroke and invasive breast cancer in women greater than 65 years of age.\nThe Women’s Health Initiative Memory Study\n- In the WHIMS ancillary studies of postmenopausal women 65 to 79 years of age, there was an increased risk of developing probable dementia in women receiving estrogen-alone or estrogen plus progestin when compared to placebo.\n- Since both ancillary studies were conducted in women 65 to 79 years of age, it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women8.\n\n【30】 ### Gender\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Estradiol (transdermal) with respect to specific gender populations.\n\n【31】 ### Race\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Estradiol (transdermal) with respect to specific racial populations.\n\n【32】 ### Renal Impairment\n- In postmenopausal women with end stage renal disease (ESRD) receiving maintenance hemodialysis, total estradiol serum levels are higher than in normal subjects at baseline and following oral doses of estradiol. Therefore, conventional transdermal estradiol doses used in individuals with normal renal function may be excessive for postmenopausal women with ESRD receiving maintenance hemodialysis.\n\n【33】 ### Hepatic Impairment\n- Estrogens may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function and should be administered with caution.\n\n【34】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Estradiol (transdermal) in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n\n【35】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\nThere is no FDA guidance one the use of Estradiol (transdermal) in patients who are immunocompromised.\n\n【36】 # Administration and Monitoring\n\n【37】 ### Administration\nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\n be considered to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. A woman without a uterus does not need a progestin. In some cases, however, hysterectomized women with a history of endometriosis may need a progestin.\n- Use of estrogen-alone, or in combination with a progestin, should be with the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman. Postmenopausal women should be re-evaluated periodically as clinically appropriate to determine if treatment is still necessary.\nTreatment of Moderate to Severe Vasomotor Symptoms due to Menopause\n- Start therapy with 0.025 mg per day applied to the skin once weekly. Therapy should be started at the lowest effective dose and the shortest duration consistent with the treatment goals. Attempts to taper or discontinue the medication should be made at 3 to 6 month intervals.\nTreatment of Moderate to Severe Symptoms of Vulvar and Vaginal Atrophy due to Menopause\n- Start therapy with 0.025 mg per day applied to the skin once weekly. Therapy should be started at the lowest effective dose and the shortest duration consistent with the treatment goals. Attempts to taper or discontinue the medication should be made at 3 to 6 month intervals.\nTreatment of Hypoestrogenism due to Hypogonadism, Castration, or Primary Ovarian Failure\n- Start therapy with 0.025 mg per day applied to the skin once weekly. The dose should be adjusted as necessary to control symptoms. Clinical responses (relief of symptoms) at the lowest effective dose should be the guide for establishing administration of the Climara transdermal system, especially in women with an intact uterus.\nPrevention of Postmenopausal Osteoporosis\n- Start therapy with 0.025 mg per day applied to the skin once weekly.\nApplication of the Climara Transdermal System\nSite Selection:\n- The adhesive side of Climara should be placed on a clean, dry area of the lower abdomen or the upper quadrant of the buttock.\n- Climara should not be applied to or near the breasts.\n- The sites of application must be rotated, with an interval of at least 1-week allowed between applications to the same site.\n- The area selected should not be oily, damaged, or irritated. The waistline should be avoided, since tight clothing may rub the transdermal system off.\n be avoided.\nApplication:\n- Climara should be applied immediately after opening the pouch and removing the protective liner.\n- Climara should be pressed firmly in place with the fingers for at least 10 seconds, making sure there is good contact, especially around the edges.\n- If the system lifts, apply pressure to maintain adhesion.\n- In the event that a system should fall off reapply it to a different location. If the system cannot be reapplied, a new system should be applied for the remainder of the 7-day dosing interval.\n- Only one system should be worn at any one time during the 7-day dosing interval.\n- Swimming, bathing, or using a sauna while using Climara has not been studied, and these activities may decrease the adhesion of the system and the delivery of estradiol.\nRemoval of the Climara Transdermal System\n- Removal of Climara should be done carefully and slowly to avoid irritation of the skin.\n- Should any adhesive remain on the skin after removal of the Climara system, allow the area to dry for 15 minutes. Then gently rubbing the area with an oil-based cream or lotion should remove the adhesive residue.\n- Used patches still contain some active hormones. Each patch should be carefully folded in half so that it sticks to itself before throwing it away.\nDOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS\n- Climara (estradiol transdermal system), 0.025 mg per day—each 6.5 cm2 system contains 2 mg of estradiol\n- Climara (estradiol transdermal system), 0.0375 mg per day—each 9.375 cm2 system contains 2.85 mg of estradiol\n- Climara (estradiol transdermal system), 0.05 mg per day—each 12.5 cm2 system contains 3.8 mg of estradiol\n- Climara (estradiol transdermal system), 0.060 mg per day—each 15 cm2 system contains 4.55 mg of estradiol\n- Climara (estradiol transdermal system), 0.075 mg per day—each 18.75 cm2 system contains 5.7 mg of estradiol\n- Climara (estradiol transdermal system), 0.1 mg per day—each 25.0 cm2 system contains 7.6 mg of estradiol\n\n【38】 ### Monitoring\n receiving estrogens may require increased doses of their thyroid replacement therapy. These women should have their thyroid function monitored in order to maintain their free thyroid hormone levels in an acceprange.\n\n【39】 # IV Compatibility\nThere is limited information regarding the compatibility of Estradiol (transdermal) and IV administrations.\n\n【40】 # Overdosage\n- Overdosage of estrogen may cause nausea, vomiting, breast tenderness, abdominal pain, drowsiness and fatigue, and withdrawal bleeding in women. Treatment of overdose consists of discontinuation of Climara therapy with institution of appropriate symptomatic care.\n\n【41】 # Pharmacology\n\n【42】 ## Mechanism of Action\n- Endogenous estrogens are largely responsible for the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system and secondary sexual characteristics. Although circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions, estradiol is the principal intracellular human estrogen and is substantially more potent than its metabolites, estrone and estriol at the receptor level.\n- The primary source of estrogen in normally cycling adult women is the ovarian follicle, which secretes 70 to 500 mcg of estradiol daily, depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle. After menopause, most endogenous estrogen is produced by conversion of androstenedione, which is secreted by the adrenal cortex, to estrone in the peripheral tissues. Thus, estrone and the sulfate conjugated form, estrone sulfate, are the most abundant circulating estrogens in postmenopausal women.\n- Estrogens act through binding to nuclear receptors in estrogen-responsive tissues. To date, two estrogen receptors have been identified. These vary in proportion from tissue to tissue.\n- Circulating estrogens modulate the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and FSH, through a negative feedback mechanism. Estrogens act to reduce the elevated levels of these hormones seen in postmenopausal women.\n\n【43】 ## Structure\n- Climara (estradiol transdermal system), is designed to release estradiol continuously upon application to intact skin. Six (6.5, 9.375, 12.5, 15, 18.75 and 25 cm systems are available to provide nominal in vivo delivery of 0.025, 0.0375, 0.05, 0.06, 0.075 or 0.1 mg respectively of estradiol per day. The period of use is 7 days. Each system has a contact surface area of either 6.5, 9.375, 12.5, 15, 18.75 or 25 cm2, and contains 2, 2.85, 3.8, 4.55, 5.7 or 7.6 mg of estradiol USP respectively. The composition of the systems per unit area is identical.\n- Estradiol USP is a white, crystalline powder, chemically described as estra-1,3,5-triene-3, 17β-diol. It has an empirical formula of C18 H24 O2 and molecular weight of 272.38. The structural formula is:\n- The Climara transdermal system comprises three layers. Proceeding from the visible surface toward the surface attached to the skin, these layers are:\n- A translucent polyethylene film.\n- An acrylate adhesive matrix containing estradiol USP.\n- A protective liner of siliconized or fluoropolymer-coated polyester film is attached to the adhesive surface and must be removed before the system can be used.\n- The active component of the transdermal system is estradiol. The remaining components of the transdermal system (acrylate copolymer adhesive, fatty acid esters, and polyethylene backing) are pharmacologically inactive.\n\n【44】 ## Pharmacodynamics\n- There are no pharmacodynamic data for Climara.\n\n【45】 ## Pharmacokinetics\nAbsorption\n- Transdermal administration of Climara produces mean serum concentrations of estradiol comparable to those produced by premenopausal women in the early follicular phase of the ovulatory cycle. The pharmacokinetics of estradiol following application of the Climara transdermal system were investigated in 197 healthy postmenopausal women in six studies. In five of the studies, the Climara transdermal system was applied to the abdomen, and in a sixth study, application to the buttocks and abdomen were compared.\n- The Climara transdermal delivery system continuously releases estradiol which is transported across intact skin leading to sustained circulating levels of estradiol during a 7-day treatment period. The systemic availability of estradiol after transdermal administration is about 20 times higher than that after oral administration. This difference is due to the absence of first pass metabolism when estradiol is given by the transdermal route.\n\n【46】 - Dose proportionality was demonstrated for the Climara 6.5 cm2 transdermal system as compared to the Climara 12.5 cm2 transdermal system in a 2-week crossover study with a 1-week washout period between the two-transdermal systems in 24 postmenopausal women.\n demonstrated for the Climara transdermal system (12.5 cm2 and 25 cm in a 1-week study conducted in 54 postmenopausal women. The mean steady state levels (Cavg) of the estradiol during the application of Climara 25 cm2 and 12.5 cm2 on the abdomen were about 80 and 40 pg/mL, respectively.\n- In a 3-week multiple application study in 24 postmenopausal women, the 25 cm2 Climara transdermal system produced average peak estradiol concentrations (Cmax) of approximately 100 pg/mL. Trough values at the end of each wear interval (Cmin) were approximately 35 pg/mL. Nearly identical serum curves were seen each week, indicating little or no accumulation of estradiol in the body. Serum estrone peak and trough levels were 60 and 40 pg/mL, respectively.\n- In a single dose, randomized, crossover study conducted to compare the effect of site of application, 38 postmenopausal women wore a single Climara 25 cm2 transdermal system for 1 week on the abdomen and buttocks. The estradiol serum concentration profiles are shown in  Values of Cmax and Cavg were, respectively, 25 percent and 17 percent higher with the buttock application than with the abdomen application.\n- The relative standard deviation of each pharmacokinetic parameter after application to the abdomen averaged 50 percent, which is indicative of the considerable intersubject variability associated with transdermal drug delivery. The relative standard deviation of each pharmacokinetic parameter after application to the buttock was lower than that after application to the abdomen (for example, for Cmax 39 percent versus 62 percent, and for Cavg 35 percent versus 48 percent).\nDistribution\n- The distribution of exogenous estrogens is similar to that of endogenous estrogens. Estrogens are widely distributed in the body and are generally found in higher concentrations in the sex hormone target organs. Estrogens circulate in the blood largely bound to SHBG and albumin.\nMetabolism\n undergo enterohepatic recirculation via sulfate and glucuronide conjugation in the liver, biliary secretion of conjugates into the intestine, and hydrolysis in the intestine followed by reabsorption. In postmenopausal women, a significant proportion of the circulating estrogens exist as sulfate conjugates, especially estrone sulfate, which serves as a circulating reservoir for the formation of more active estrogens.\nExcretion\n- Estradiol, estrone, and estriol are excreted in the urine along with glucuronide and sulfate conjugates.\nAdhesion\n- An open-label study of adhesion potentials of placebo transdermal systems that correspond to the 6.5 cm2 and 12.5 cm2 sizes of Climara was conducted in 112 healthy women of 45 to 75 years of age. Each woman applied both transdermal systems weekly, on the upper outer abdomen, for 3 consecutive weeks. It should be noted that lower abdomen and upper quadrant of the buttock are the approved sites of application for Climara.\n- The adhesion assessment was done visually on Days 2, 4, 5, 6, 7 of each week of transdermal system wear. A total of 1,654 adhesion observations were conducted for 333 transdermal systems of each size.\n- Of these observations, approximately 90 percent showed essentially no lift for both the 6.5 cm2 and 12.5 cm2 transdermal systems. Of the total number of transdermal systems applied, approximately 5 percent showed complete detachment for each size. Adhesion potentials of the 18.75 cm2 and 25 cm2 sizes of transdermal systems (0.075 mg per day and 0.1 mg per day) have not been studied.\n\n【47】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\nCarcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\n- Long-term continuous administration of natural and synthetic estrogens in certain animal species increases the frequency of carcinomas of the breast, uterus, cervix, vagina, testis, and liver.\n\n【48】 # Clinical Studies\nEffects on Vasomotor Symptoms\n- A study of 214 women 25 to 74 years of age met the qualification criteria and were randomly assigned to one of the three treatment groups: 72 to the 0.05 mg estradiol patch, 70 to the 0.1 mg estradiol patch, and 72 to placebo. Potential subjects were postmenopausal women in good general health who experienced vasomotor symptoms. Natural menopause patients had not menstruated for at least 12 months and surgical menopause patients had undergone bilateral oophorectomy at least 4 weeks before evaluation for study entry. In order to enter the 11-week treatment phase of the study, potential subjects must have experienced a minimum of five moderate to severe hot flushes per week, or a minimum of 15 hot flushes of any severity per week, for 2 consecutive weeks. Women wore the patches in a cyclical fashion (three weeks on and one week off).\n- During treatment, all subjects used diaries to record the number and severity of hot flushes. Subjects were monitored by clinic visits at the end of weeks 1, 3, 7, and 11 and by telephone at the end of weeks 4, 5, 8, and 9.\n- Adequate data for the analysis of efficacy was available from 191 subjects. The results are presented as the mean ± SD number of flushes in each of the 3 treatment weeks of each 4-week cycle. In the 0.05 mg estradiol group, the mean weekly hot flush rate across all treatment cycles decreased from 46 ± 6.5 at baseline to 20 ± 3 (-67 percent). The 0.1 mg estradiol group had a decline in the mean weekly hot flush rate from 52 ± 4.4 at baseline to 16 ± 2.4 (-72 percent). In the placebo group, the mean weekly hot flush rate declined from 53 ± 4.5 at baseline to 46 ± 6.5 (-18.1 percent). Compared with placebo, the 0.05 mg and 0.1 mg estradiol groups showed a statistically significantly larger mean decrease in hot flushes across all treatment cycles (P<0.. When the response to treatment was analyzed for each of the three cycles of therapy, similar statistically significant differences were observed between both estradiol treatment groups and the placebo group during all treatment cycles.\n- In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study of 187 women receiving Climara 0.025 mg per day or placebo continuously for up to three 28-day cycles, the Climara 0.025 mg per day dosage was shown to be statistically better than placebo at weeks 4 and 12 for relief of both the frequency and severity of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms.\n: Mean Change from Baseline in the Number of Moderate to Severe\nVasomotor Symptoms Intent to Treat (ITT)\nEffects on Bone Mineral Density\n- A two-year clinical trial enrolled a total of 175 healthy, hysterectomized, postmenopausal, non-osteoporotic (that is, lumbar spine bone mineral density >0.9 gm/cm women at 10 study centers in the United States. A total of 129 subjects were allocated to receive active treatment with 4 different doses of estradiol patches (6.5, 12.5, 15, 25 cm and 46 subjects were allocated to receive placebo patches. Seventy-seven percent of the randomized subjects (100 on active drug and 34 on placebo) contributed data to the analysis of percent change of anterior-posterior (A-P) spine BMD, the primary efficacy variable  . A statistically significant overall treatment effect at each timepoint was noted, implying bone preservation for all active treatment groups at all timepoints, as opposed to bone loss for placebo at all timepoints.\n- : Mean Percent Change from Baseline in Lumbar Spine (A-P View) Bone Mineral Density By Treatment\nand Time Last Observation Carried Forward\n- : Mean Percent Change from Baseline in Lumbar Spine (A-P View) Bone Mineral Density By Treatment and Time Last Observation Carried Forward\n statistically significantly different from placebo for all active treatment groups. This is based on 74 percent of the randomized subjects (95 on active drug and 34 on placebo).\nWomen's Health Initiative Studies\n- The WHI enrolled approximately 27,000 predominantly healthy postmenopausal women in two substudies to assess the risks and benefits of daily oral CE (0.625 mg)-alone or in combination with MPA (2.5 mg) compared to placebo in the prevention of certain chronic diseases. The primary endpoint was the incidence of CHD (defined as nonfatal MI, silent MI and CHD death), with invasive breast cancer as the primary adverse outcome. A \"global index\" included the earliest occurrence of CHD, invasive breast cancer, stroke, PE, endometrial cancer (only in the CE plus MPA substudy), colorectal cancer, hip fracture, or death due to other causes. These substudies did not evaluate the effects of CE-alone or CE plus MPA on menopausal symptoms.\nWHI Estrogen-Alone Substudy\n- The WHI estrogen-alone substudy was stopped early because an increased risk of stroke was observed, and it was deemed that no further information would be obtained regarding the risk and benefits of estrogen-alone in predetermined primary endpoints.\n- Results of the estrogen-alone substudy, which included 10,739 women (average 63 years of age, range 50 to 79: 75.3 percent White, 15.1 percent Black, 6.1 percent Hispanic, 3.6 percent Other) after an average follow-up of 7.1 years, are presented in \n- For those outcomes included in the WHI \"global index\" that reached statistical significance, the absolute excess risks per 10,000 women-years in the group treated with CE-alone was 12 more strokes, while the absolute risk reduction per 10,000 women-years was 7 fewer hip fractures.9 The absolute excess risk of events included in the \"global index\" was a non-significant 5 events per 10,000 women-years. There was no difference between the groups in terms of all-cause mortality.\n\n【49】 - Timing of initiation of estrogen-alone therapy relative to the start of menopause may affect the overall risk-benefit profile. The WHI estrogen-alone substudy stratified by age showed in women 50 to 59 years of age a non-significant trend toward reduced risk for CHD  and overall mortality .\nWHI Estrogen Plus Progestin Substudy\n- The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy was stopped early. According to the predefined stopping rule, after an average follow-up of 5.6 years of treatment, the increased risk of invasive breast cancer and cardiovascular events exceeded the specified benefits included in the \"global index\". The absolute excess risk of events included in the “global index” was 19 per 10,000 women-years.\n- For those outcomes included in the WHI “global index” that reached statistical significance after 5.6 years of follow-up, the absolute excess risks per 10,000 women-years in the group treated with CE plus MPA were 7 more CHD events, 8 more strokes, 10 more PEs, and 8 more invasive breast cancers, while the absolute risk reduction per 10,000 women-years were 6 fewer colorectal cancers and 5 fewer hip fractures.\n- Results of the CE plus MPA substudy, which included 16,608 women (average 63 years of age, range 50 to 79; 83.9 percent White, 6.5 percent Black, 5.4 percent Hispanic, 3.9 percent Other), are presented in  . These results reflect centrally adjudicated data after an average follow-up of 5.6 years.\n- Timing of initiation of estrogen plus progestin therapy relative to the start of menopause may affect the overall risk benefit profile. The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy stratified by age showed in women 50 to 59 years of age a non-significant trend toward reduced risk for overall mortality .\nWomen's Health Initiative Memory Study\n- The WHIMS estrogen-alone ancillary study of WHI enrolled 2,947 predominantly healthy hysterectomized postmenopausal women 65 to 79 years of age (45 percent were 65 to 69 years of age; 36 percent were 70 to 74 years of age; 19 percent were 75 years of age and older) to evaluate the effects of daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone on the incidence of probable dementia (primary outcome) compared to placebo.\n- After an average follow-up of 5.2 years, the relative risk of probable dementia for CE-alone versus placebo was 1.49 (95 percent CI, 0.83-2.. The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE-alone versus placebo was 37 versus 25 cases per 10,000 women-years. Probable dementia as defined in the study included Alzheimer’s disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD) and mixed types (having features of both AD and VaD). The most common classification of probable dementia in the treatment group and the placebo group was AD. Since the ancillary study was conducted in women 65 to 79 years of age, it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women.\n- The WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study enrolled 4,532 predominantly healthy postmenopausal women 65 years of age and older (47 percent were 65 to 69 years of age; 35 percent were 70 to 74 years of age; and 18 percent were 75 years of age and older) to evaluate the effects of daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) on the incidence of probable dementia (primary outcome) compared to placebo.\n- After an average follow-up of 4 years, the relative risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 2.05 (95 percent CI, 1.21-3.. The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 45 versus 22 cases per 10,000 women-years. Probable dementia as defined in the study included AD, VaD and mixed types (having features of both AD and VaD). The most common classification of probable dementia in the treatment group and the placebo group was AD. Since the ancillary study was conducted in women 65 to 79 years of age, it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women.\n- When data from the two populations were pooled as planned in the WHIMS protocol, the reported overall relative risk for probable dementia was 1.76 (95 percent CI, 1.19-2.. Differences between groups became apparent in the first year of treatment. It is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women.\n\n【50】 # How Supplied\n- Climara (estradiol transdermal system), 0.025 mg per day — each 6.5 cm2 system contains 2 mg of estradiol USP\n- Individual Carton of 4 systems NDC 50419-454-04\n- Climara (estradiol transdermal system), 0.0375 mg per day — each 9.375 cm2 system contains 2.85 mg of estradiol USP\n- Individual Carton of 4 systems NDC 50419-456-04\n- Climara (estradiol transdermal system), 0.05 mg per day — each 12.5 cm2 system contains 3.8 mg of estradiol USP\n- Individual Carton of 4 systems NDC 50419-451-04\n- Climara (estradiol transdermal system), 0.06 mg per day — each 15 cm2 system contains 4.55 mg of estradiol USP\n- Individual Carton of 4 systems NDC 50419-459-04\n- Climara (estradiol transdermal system), 0.075 mg per day — each 18.75 cm2 system contains 5.7 mg of estradiol USP\n- Individual Carton of 4 systems NDC 50419-453-04\n- Climara (estradiol transdermal system), 0.1 mg per day — each 25 cm2 system contains 7.6 mg of estradiol USP\n- Individual Carton of 4 systems NDC 50419-452-04\n\n【51】 ## Storage\n- Store at 20°C to 25°C (66°F to 77°F); excursions permitted between 15°C and 30°C (59°F and 86°F).

Severe, rarely fatal anaphylactic-like reactions to NSAIDs have been reported in such patients.\nCoronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG)\n- Caldolor is contraindicated for the treatment of peri-operative pain in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.\n\n【18】 # Warnings\nCardiovascular Thrombotic Events\n- Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, myocardial infarction and stroke, which can be fatal. All NSAIDs, both COX-2 selective and nonselective, may have a similar risk. Patients with known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease may be at greater risk. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in patients treated with an NSAID, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the signs and/or symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.\n- Two large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10-14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke.\n- There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID does increase the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events.\nGastrointestinal Effects: Risk of Ulceration, Bleeding, and Perforation\n- NSAIDs, including ibuprofen, can cause serious GI adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occur in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3-6 months and in about 2-4% of patients treated for one year. These trends continue with longer duration of use, increasing the likelihood of developing a serious GI event at some time during the course of therapy. However, even short-term therapy is not without risk.\n- Prescribe NSAIDs, including Caldolor, with extreme caution in those with a prior history of ulcer disease or GI bleeding. Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who use NSAIDs have a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to treated patients with neither of these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids or anticoagulants, longer duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status. Most reports of spontaneous fatal GI events are in elderly or debilitated patients, and therefore special care should be taken in treating this population.\n- To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event in patients treated with an NSAID, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible duration. Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulcerations and bleeding during NSAID therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI event is suspected. This should include discontinuation of the NSAID until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. For high-risk patients, alternate therapies that do not involve NSAIDs should be considered.\nHepatic Effects\n- Borderline elevations of one or more liver tests may occur in up to 15% of patients taking NSAIDs, including ibuprofen. These laboratory abnormalities may progress, may remain unchanged, or may be transient with continuing therapy. Noelevations of ALT or AST (approximately three or more times the upper limit of normal) have been reported in approximately 1% of patients in clinical trials with NSAIDs. In addition, rare cases of severe hepatic reactions have been reported, including jaundice, fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis and hepatic failure, some with fatal outcomes. A patient with symptoms and/or signs suggesting liver dysfunction, or with abnormal liver test values, should be evaluated for evidence of the development of a more severe hepatic reaction while on therapy with ibuprofen. If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), ibuprofen should be discontinued.\nHypertension\n- NSAIDs, including ibuprofen, can lead to onset of new hypertension or worsening of pre-existing hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Use NSAIDs, including ibuprofen, with caution in patients with hypertension throughout the course of therapy.\n- Patients taking ACE inhibitors, thiazides, or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs.\nCongestive Heart Failure and Edema\n- Fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients taking NSAIDs. Use Caldolor with caution in patients with fluid retention or heart failure.\nRenal Effects\n- Use caution when initiating treatment with Caldolor in patients with considerable dehydration.\n been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics or ACE inhibitors, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.\n- No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of Caldolor in patients with advanced renal disease. If Caldolor therapy must be initiated in patients with advanced renal disease, closely monitor the patient's renal function.\nAnaphylactoid Reactions\n- As with other NSAIDs, anaphylactoid reactions may occur in patients without known prior exposure to ibuprofen. Caldolor is contraindicated in patients with the aspirin triad. This symptom complex typically occurs in asthmatic patients who experience rhinitis with or without nasal polyps, or who exhibit severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs.\nSerious Skin Reactions\n- NSAIDs, including ibuprofen, can cause serious skin adverse reactions such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. These serious events may occur without warning. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of serious skin manifestations, and to discontinue Caldolor at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity.\nPregnancy\n- Starting at 30 weeks gestation, Caldolor, and other NSAIDs, should be avoided by pregnant women as premature closure of the ductus arteriosus in the fetus may occur.\nMasking Inflammation and Fever\n- The pharmacological activity of ibuprofen in reducing fever and inflammation may diminish the utility of these diagnostic signs in detecting complications of presumed noninfectious, painful conditions.\nHematological Effects\n- Caldolor must be diluted prior to use. Infusion of the drug product without dilution can cause hemolysis.\n- Anemia may occur in patients receiving NSAIDs, including ibuprofen. This may be due to fluid retention, occult or gross GI blood loss, or an incompletely described effect on erythropoiesis. In patients on long-term treatment with NSAIDs, including ibuprofen, check hemoglobin or hematocrit if they exhibit any signs or symptoms of anemia or blood loss.\n- NSAIDs inhibit platelet aggregation and have been shown to prolong bleeding time in some patients. Unlike aspirin, their effects on platelet function are less severe quantitatively, of shorter duration, and reversible. Carefully monitor patients who may be adversely affected by alterations in platelet function, such as those with coagulation disorders or patients receiving anticoagulants.\nPre-existing Asthma\n- Patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma. The use of aspirin in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma has been associated with severe bronchospasm, which can be fatal. Since cross-reactivity between aspirin and NSAIDs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, including bronchospasm, Caldolor is contraindicated in patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity and should be used with caution in all patients with pre-existing asthma.\nOphthalmological Effects\n- Blurred or diminished vision, scotomata, and changes in color vision have been reported with oral ibuprofen. Discontinue ibuprofen if a patient develops such complaints, and refer the patient for an ophthalmologic examination that includes central visual fields and color vision testing.\nAseptic Meningitis\n- Aseptic meningitis with fever and coma has been observed in patients on oral ibuprofen therapy. Although it is probably more likely to occur in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and related connective tissue diseases, it has been reported in patients who do not have underlying chronic disease. If signs or symptoms of meningitis develop in a patient on ibuprofen, give consideration to whether or not the signs or symptoms are related to ibuprofen therapy.\nMonitoring\n- Because serious GI tract ulcerations and bleeding can occur without warning symptoms, physicians should monitor for signs or symptoms of GI bleeding.\n- Patients on long-term treatment with NSAIDs should have CBC and chemistry profiles checked periodically. If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver or renal disease develop, systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash), or abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, discontinue Caldolor.\n\n【19】 # Adverse Reactions\n\n【20】 ## Clinical Trials Experience\n- The following serious adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in the labeling:\n- Cardiovascular thrombotic events.\n- Gastrointestinal effects\n- Hepatic effects\n- Hypertension\n- Congestive heart failure and edema\n- Renal effects\n- Anaphylactoid reactions\n- Serious skin reactions\n- The most common adverse reactions reported in clinical studies are nausea, flatulence, vomiting, and headache.\n- The most common reason for discontinuation due to adverse events in controlled trials of Caldolor is pruritus (<1%).\n\n【21】 # Clinical Studies Experience\n- Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be compared directly to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.\n- During clinical development, 560 patients were exposed to Caldolor, 438 in pain and 122 with fever. In the pain studies, Caldolor was started intra-operatively and administered at a dose of 400 mg or 800 mg every six hours for up to three days. In the fever studies, Caldolor was administered at doses of 100 mg, 200 mg, or 400 mg every four or six hours for up to 3 days.\n- The most frequent type of adverse reaction occurring with oral ibuprofen is gastrointestinal.\nPain Studies\n receiving morphine as needed for post-operative pain.\nFever Studies\n- Fever studies were conducted in febrile hospitalized patients with malaria and febrile hospitalized patients with varying causes of fever. In hospitalized febrile patients with malaria, the adverse reactions observed in at least two Caldolor-treated patients included abdominal pain and nasal congestion.\n- In hospitalized febrile patients (all causes), adverse reactions observed in more than two patients in any given treatment group are presented in the below.\n\n【22】 ## Postmarketing Experience\nThere is limited information regarding Postmarketing Experience of Ibuprofen (injection) in the drug label.\n\n【23】 # Drug Interactions\nAspirin\n- When ibuprofen is administered with aspirin, ibuprofen's protein binding is reduced, although the clearance of free ibuprofen is not altered. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known; however, as with other NSAIDs, concomitant administration of Caldolor and aspirin is not generally recommended because of the potential for increased adverse effects.\nAnticoagulants\n- The effects of warfarin and NSAIDs on GI bleeding are synergistic, such that the users of both drugs together have a higher risk of serious GI bleeding than users of either drug alone.\nACE Inhibitors\n- NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors. This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking NSAIDs concomitantly with ACE inhibitors.\nDiuretics\n- Clinical studies and postmarketing observations have shown that ibuprofen can reduce the natriuretic effects of furosemide and thiazides in some patients. This response has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. During concomitant therapy with NSAIDs, observe patients closely for signs of renal failure, as well as to assure diuretic efficacy .\nLithium\n- NSAIDs have produced elevations of plasma lithium levels and a reduction in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15%, and the renal clearance of lithium decreased by 20%. This effect has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by the NSAID. Thus, when NSAIDs and lithium are administered concurrently, observe patients carefully for signs of lithium toxicity.\nMethotrexate\n- NSAIDs have been reported to competitively inhibit methotrexate accumulation in rabbit kidney slices. This indicates that NSAIDs may enhance the toxicity of methotrexate. Use caution when NSAIDs are administered concomitantly with methotrexate.\nH-2 Antagonists\n- In studies of human volunteers, co-administration of cimetidine or ranitidine with ibuprofen had no substantive effect on ibuprofen serum concentrations.\n\n【24】 # Use in Specific Populations\n\n【25】 ### Pregnancy\nPregnancy Category (FDA):\n- Teratogenic effects - Pregnancy Category C prior to 30 weeks gestation; Category D starting at 30 weeks gestation.\n- Starting at 30 weeks gestation, Caldolor, and other NSAIDs, should be avoided by pregnant women as premature closure of the ductus arteriosus in the fetus may occur. Caldolor can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman starting at 30 weeks gestation.\n- There are no adequate, well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Prior to 30 weeks gestation, Caldolor should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\n- Reproductive studies conducted in rats and rabbits have not demonstrated evidence of developmental abnormalities.\nPregnancy Category (AUS): \nThere is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Ibuprofen (injection) in women who are pregnant.\n\n【26】 ### Labor and Delivery\n- The effects of Caldolor on labor and delivery in pregnant women are unknown. In rat studies, maternal exposure to NSAIDs, as with other drugs known to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, increased the incidence of dystocia and delayed parturition, and decreased pup survival.\n\n【27】 ### Nursing Mothers\n- It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from Caldolor, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\n\n【28】 ### Pediatric Use\n- Safety and effectiveness of Caldolor for management of pain and reduction of fever has not been established in pediatric patients below the age of 17 years.\n\n【29】 ### Geriatic Use\n- Clinical studies of Caldolor did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Elderly patients are at increased risk for serious GI adverse events.\n\n【30】 ### Gender\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Ibuprofen (injection) with respect to specific gender populations.\n\n【31】 ### Race\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Ibuprofen (injection) with respect to specific racial populations.\n\n【32】 ### Renal Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Ibuprofen (injection) in patients with renal impairment.\n\n【33】 ### Hepatic Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Ibuprofen (injection) in patients with hepatic impairment.\n\n【34】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Ibuprofen (injection) in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n\n【35】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\nThere is no FDA guidance one the use of Ibuprofen (injection) in patients who are immunocompromised.\n\n【36】 # Administration and Monitoring\n\n【37】 ### Administration\n- Intravenous\n\n【38】 ### Monitoring\nThere is limited information regarding Monitoring of Ibuprofen (injection) in the drug label.\n\n【39】 # IV Compatibility\nThere is limited information regarding IV Compatibility of Ibuprofen (injection) in the drug label.\n\n【40】 # Overdosage\n- The following signs and symptoms have occurred in individuals following an overdose of oral ibuprofen: abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, and dizziness. There are no specific measures to treat acute overdosage with Caldolor. There is no known antidote to ibuprofen. In case of an overdosage, discontinue Caldolor therapy and consider contacting a regional poison control center at 1-800-222-1222.\n\n【41】 # Pharmacology\n\n【42】 ## Mechanism of Action\n- Ibuprofen's mechanism of action, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but may be related to prostaglandin synthetase inhibition. Caldolor possesses anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic activity.\n\n【43】 ## Structure\n- Caldolor contains the active ingredient ibuprofen, which is (±)-2-(p-isobutylphenyl) propionic acid. Ibuprofen is a white powder with a melting point of 74-77°C. It has a molecular weight of 206.28. It is very slightly soluble in water (<1 mg/mL) and readily soluble in organic solvents such as ethanol and acetone. The structural formula of ibuprofen is represented below:\n contains 78 mg/mL arginine at a molar ratio of 0.92:1 arginine:ibuprofen. The solution pH is about 7.4.\n- Caldolor is sterile and is intended for intravenous administration only.\n\n【44】 ## Pharmacodynamics\nThere is limited information regarding Pharmacodynamics of Ibuprofen (injection) in the drug label.\n\n【45】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n- Ibuprofen is a racemic mixture of R- and S-isomers. In vivo and in vitro studies indicate that the S-isomer is responsible for clinical activity. The R-form, while thought to be pharmacologically inactive, is slowly and incompletely (~60%) interconverted into the active S species in adults. The R-isomer serves as a circulating reservoir to maintain levels of active drug. The pharmacokinetic parameters of Caldolor determined in a study with volunteers are presented below.\n- Ibuprofen, like most NSAIDs, is highly protein bound (>99% bound at 20 mcg/mL). Protein binding is saturable, and at concentrations >20 mcg/mL binding is nonlinear. Based on oral dosing data, there is an age- or fever-related change in volume of distribution for ibuprofen.\n\n【46】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\nThere is limited information regarding Nonclinical Toxicology of Ibuprofen (injection) in the drug label.\n\n【47】 # Clinical Studies\nAnalgesia (Pain)\n- The effect of Caldolor on acute pain was evaluated in two multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies.\n- In a study of women who had undergone an elective abdominal hysterectomy, 319 patients were randomized and treated with Caldolor 800 mg or placebo administered every 6 hours (started intra-operatively) and morphine administered on an as needed basis. Efficacy was demonstrated as a statistically significant greater reduction in the mean morphine consumption through 24 hours in patients who received Caldolor as compared to those receiving placebo (47 mg and 56 mg, respectively). The clinical relevance of this finding is supported by a greater reduction in pain intensity over 24 hours for patients treated with Caldolor, even though morphine was available on an as needed basis.\n- In a study of patients who had undergone an elective abdominal or orthopedic surgery, 406 patients (87 men, 319 women) were randomized to receive Caldolor 400 mg, Caldolor 800 mg, or placebo administered every 6 hours (started intra-operatively), and morphine on an as needed basis. This study failed to demonstrate a statistically significant difference in outcome between patients receiving Caldolor 800 mg or 400 mg and placebo, although there were trends favoring the active treatments.\nAntipyretic (Fever)\n- The effect of Caldolor on fever was evaluated in two randomized, double-blind studies.\n- In a multi-center study, 120 hospitalized patients (88 men, 32 women) with temperatures of 101°F or greater were randomized to Caldolor 400 mg, 200 mg, 100 mg or placebo, administered every 4 hours for 24 hours. Each of the three Caldolor doses, 100 mg, 200 mg, and 400 mg, resulted in a statistically greater percentage of patients with a reduced temperature (<101°F) after 4 hours, compared to placebo (65%, 73%, 77% and 32%, respectively). The dose response is shown in the below.\n- In a single-center study, 60 hospitalized patients (48 men, 12 women) with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria having temperatures ≥100.4°F were randomized to Caldolor 400 mg or placebo, administered every 6 hours for 72 hours of treatment. There was a significant reduction in fever within the first 24 hours of treatment, measured as the area above the temperature 98.6°F vs. time curve for patients treated with Caldolor.\n\n【48】 # How Supplied\n- Caldolor is available in the following strengths:\n- 800 mg/8 mL (100 mg/mL)\n- Carton of 25 vials, NDC 66220-287-08\n\n【49】 ## Storage\n- Store at controlled room temperature 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F).\n\n【50】 # Images\n\n【51】 ## Drug Images\n\n【52】 ## Package and Label Display Panel\n\n【53】 # Patient Counseling Information\nThere is limited information regarding Patient Counseling Information of Ibuprofen (injection) in the drug label.\n\n【54】 # Precautions with Alcohol\n- Alcohol-Ibuprofen (injection) interaction has not been established.

If you become pregnant while taking lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide, call your doctor immediately. Lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide may harm the fetus.\n\n【2】 # Why this medication is prescribed\nThe combination of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide is used to treat high blood pressure. Lisinopril is in a class of medications called angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. It works by decreasing certain chemicals that tighten the blood vessels, so blood flows more smoothly. Hydrochlorothiazide is in a class of medications called diuretics ('water pills'). It works by causing the kidneys to get rid of unneeded water and salt from the body into the urine.\n\n【3】 # How this medication should be used\nThe combination of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide comes as a t to take by mouth. It is usually taken once a day with or without food. To help you remember to take lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide, take it around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\nLisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide controls high blood pressure but does not cure it. Continue to take lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide even if you feel well. Do not stop taking lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide without talking to your doctor.\n\n【4】 # Other uses for this medicine\nThis medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\n【5】 # Special precautions\nBefore taking lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazi\n- tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, benazepril (Lotensin), captopril (Capoten), enalapril (Vasotec), fosinopril (Monopril), moexipril (Univasc), quinapril (Accupril), ramipril (Altace), trandolapril (Mavik), sulfa drugs, or any other medications.\n- tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking.

Therefore, this procedure should only be used with special arrangements for clinical governance, consent, and audit or research. Find out what special arrangements mean on the NICE interventional procedures guidance page.\nFor adults with dysphagia not caused by a stroke, there is insufficient evidence on efficacy to support the use of this procedure. Therefore, this procedure should only be used in the context of research. Find out what only in research means on the NICE interventional procedures guidance page.\nClinicians wishing to do transcutaneous neuromuscular electrical stimulation for adults with oropharyngeal dysphagia after a stroke should:\nInform the clinical governance leads in their NHS trusts.\nEnsure that patients understand the procedure's safety and efficacy, as well as any uncertainties about these and provide them with clear written information to support shared decision-making. In addition, the use of NICE's information for the public on transcutaneous neuromuscular electrical stimulation is recommended.\nAudit and review clinical outcomes of all patients having transcutaneous neuromuscular electrical stimulation for oropharyngeal dysphagia. NICE has identified relevant audit criteria and has developed NICE's interventional procedure outcomes audit tool (which is for use at local discretion).\nFurther research on transcutaneous neuromuscular electrical stimulation for oropharyngeal dysphagia in adults should address patient selection, variations in technique, the need for retreatments and long-term outcomes.# The condition, current treatments and procedure\n\n【3】 # The condition\nDifficulty in swallowing (dysphagia) can be caused by neurological impairment affecting the muscles of the oropharynx. It can happen because of a stroke, traumatic brain injury, disorders of cerebral development, neurodegenerative conditions and major head and neck surgery (for example, to remove cancer). Dysphagia may lead to malnutrition, dehydration and aspiration pneumonia.\n\n【4】 # Current treatments\nTreatment options depend on the cause and severity of the dysphagia. Conservative treatments involve swallowing therapy to help the patient relearn swallowing techniques and strengthen oropharyngeal muscles. In severe cases, nasogastric tubes or percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tubes may be used to provide nutritional support.\n\n【5】 # The procedure\n promotes recovery of cortical control of swallowing.\nNMES is usually done by a speech and language therapist after appropriate diagnosis and patient selection. Therapists need appropriate training to use the procedure. The speech and language therapist places electrodes in selected positions on the patient's neck. Small electrical currents are then passed through the electrodes to stimulate the peripheral nerve supply of the pharyngeal or laryngeal muscles. Stimulus intensity may be at a low sensory level, or at a higher motor level to trigger muscle contractions. Under the supervision of the therapist, the patient exercises their swallowing muscles while having concurrent electrical stimulation. Treatment duration recommendations vary by device, but can be up to 1 hour. The mild electrical stimulation can produce feelings ranging from tingling and warmth, to a 'grabbing' sensation.\nThe position of the electrodes and levels of current used vary from patient to patient. There is a range of NMES devices that use different electrode designs, positions and stimulus intensities. At an initial assessment, videofluoroscopy or clinical observation may be used to optimise the placement of treatment electrodes and to determine an appropriate stimulus intensity.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

There may be difficulty breathing, dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), and/or dyspepsia (discomfort in the upper abdomen), especially if the lump becomes large.\nThe most common locations for a thyroglossal cyst is midline or slightly off midline, between the isthmus of the thyroid and the hyoid bone or just above the hyoid bone. A thyroglossal cyst can develop anywhere along a thyroglossal duct, though cysts within the tongue or in the floor of the mouth are rare.\nA thyroglossal cyst will move upwards with protrusion of the tongue.\nThyroglossal cysts are associated with an increased incidence of ectopic thyroid tissue. Occasionally, a lingual thyroid can be seen as a flattened strawberry-like lump at the base of the tongue.\nVery rarely, the persistent duct can become cancerous, called thyroglossal duct carcinoma. In the case of thyroglossal duct carcinoma, the cancerous cells are ectopic thyroid tissue that has been deposited along the thyroglossal duct and usually follows exposure to radiation.\n\n【3】 # Embryology\nThe thyroglossal tract arises from the foramen cecum at the junction of the anterior two-thirds and posterior one-third of the tongue.

Although generally benign the cyst will be removed if the patient exhibits difficulty in breathing or swallowing, or if the cyst is infected.

Take account of administration costs, dosage, price per dose and commercial arrangements.\nThese recommendations are not intended to affect treatment with faricimab that was started in the NHS before this guidance was published. People having treatment outside these recommendations may continue without change to the funding arrangements in place for them before this guidance was published, until they and their NHS clinician consider it appropriate to stop.\nWhy the committee made these recommendations\nDiabetic macular oedema is usually treated first with aflibercept or ranibizumab, which are already recommended by NICE for treating diabetic macular oedema if the eye has a central retinal thickness of 400 micrometres or more when treatment starts. Faricimab is another treatment option that works in a similar way.\n suggests similar clinical effectiveness.\nA cost comparison suggests faricimab has similar costs and overall health benefits to aflibercept or ranibizumab. So, faricimab is recommended for treating diabetic macular oedema if it is used in the same population as aflibercept and ranibizumab.# Information about faricimab\n\n【3】 # Marketing authorisation indication\nFaricimab (Vabysmo, Roche) is indicated for 'the treatment of adults with visual impairment due to diabetic macular oedema'.\n\n【4】 # Dosage in the marketing authorisation\nThe dosage schedule is available in the summary of product characteristics for faricimab.\n\n【5】 Faricimab costs £857 for 1 vial of 120 mg per 1 ml solution for injection (excluding VAT; company submission, accessed April .\nThe company has a commercial arrangement. This makes faricimab available to the NHS with a discount. The size of the discount is commercial in confidence. It is the company's responsibility to let relevant NHS organisations know details of the discount.# Committee discussion\n the committee papers for full details of the evidence.\n\n【6】 # Comparators\n\n【7】 ## Aflibercept and ranibizumab are appropriate comparators\n aware that NICE's technology appraisal guidance 349 recommends dexamethasone intravitreal implant if the diabetic macular oedema does not respond to non-corticosteroid treatment, or such treatment is unsui The committee concluded that aflibercept and ranibizumab were the appropriate NICE-recommended comparators.\n\n【8】 # Clinical evidence\n\n【9】 ## Evidence from 2 clinical trials, YOSEMITE and RHINE, shows similar clinical effectiveness of faricimab and aflibercept\nClinical evidence for faricimab compared with aflibercept came from 2 clinical trials. These were YOSEMITE and RHINE. Both were phase 3 randomised controlled trials that compared faricimab (using the dosing regimen in the marketing authorisation) with aflibercept in 1,259 adults. After the initial loading doses specified in the summary of product characteristics, aflibercept was given every 8 weeks and faricimab was administered as needed, with a maximum gap of 16 weeks between injections (a personalised treatment interval). The primary outcome measure was the mean change in best corrected visual acuity from baseline to 1 year. The evidence suggested that both treatments were similarly effective and had similar adverse events. The company had to break trial randomisation to provide subgroup results in people with central retinal thickness of 400 micrometres, which added uncertainty compared with results for the whole populations (these results are considered confidential by the company so cannot be presented here). Also, because there is only data up to 100 weeks, there is some uncertainty about how many faricimab injections are needed beyond the first 2 years. Despite these uncertainties, the committee considered that faricimab is likely to be similarly clinically effective as aflibercept.\n\n【10】 ## Faricimab is likely to have similar clinical effectiveness as ranibizumab\nThe company did a network meta-analysis comparing faricimab with ranibizumab and aflibercept. Similar to the clinical trial subgroup evidence, for the network meta-analysis the company had to break randomisation to get subgroup results for people with central retinal thickness of 400 micrometres. This made the subgroup results of the network meta-analysis uncertain (these results are academic in confidence so cannot be presented here). The ERG considered that the network meta-analysis results were potentially unreliable due to the use of inappropriate statistical methods and incorrect dosing. The committee noted that the width of the confidence intervals made it difficult to say if the treatments have similar clinical effectiveness. But clinical opinion suggests that the treatments are similarly effective. Also, the network meta-analysis results show that faricimab has comparable ocular adverse events to ranibizumab and aflibercept. The committee concluded that there was sufficient evidence of similar clinical efficacy for faricimab compared with ranibizumab.\n\n【11】 # Cost comparison\n\n【12】 ## Faricimab is likely to be cost saving or have similar costs compared with aflibercept or ranibizumab\nThe company base case assumed there would be fewer injections and monitoring visits needed for faricimab compared with the comparators. But clinical experts explained that in NHS clinical practice faricimab may have a similar dosing regimen as aflibercept and ranibizumab. They explained that this is to reduce the inconsistencies in clinical practice and chance of error in busy clinical settings. Because of this, along with the lack of long-term data, the committee considered scenarios in which the number of injections and monitoring visits was the same for faricimab, aflibercept and ranibizumab after the initial loading doses. The committee acknowledged that if the time needed between injections is lengthened, then the cost of faricimab would reduce. When taking account of the commercial arrangements for all treatments, the committee was satisfied that the total cost associated with faricimab was similar or lower than aflibercept or ranibizumab (the exact results are confidential and cannot be reported here). The committee agreed that choosing the least expensive option from the available treatment options at the same point in the pathway was appropriate. The committee therefore recommended faricimab for treating diabetic macular oedema in line with the previous recommendations for aflibercept and ranibizumab.\n\n【13】 # Other factors\n\n【14】 ## There are no equality issues relevant to the recommendations\nThe committee did not identify any equality issues.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

During these episodes, the liver cells have a reduced ability to release a digestive fluid called bile. Because the problems with bile release occur within the liver (intrahepatic), the condition is described as intrahepatic cholestasis. Episodes of cholestasis can last from weeks to months, and the time between episodes, during which there are usually no symptoms, can vary from weeks to years.\nThis condition is called benign because it does not cause lasting damage to the liver. However, episodes of liver dysfunction occasionally develop into a more severe, permanent form of liver disease known as progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis. BRIC and PFIC are sometimes considered to be part of a spectrum of intrahepatic cholestasis disorders of varying severity.\n\n【2】 # Classification\nBRIC is divided into two types, BRIC1 and BRIC2, based on the genetic cause of the condition. The signs and symptoms are the same in both types.\n\n【3】 # Pathophysiology\nMutations in the ATP8B1 gene cause benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis type 1 (BRIC, and mutations in the ABCB11 gene cause benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis type 2 (BRIC. These two genes are involved in the release (secretion) of bile, a fluid produced by the liver that helps digest fats.\nThe ATP8B1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that helps to control the distribution of lipids in the membranes of liver cells. This function likely plays a role in maintaining an appropriate balance of bile acids, a component of bile. This process, known as bile acid homeostasis, is critical for the normal secretion of bile and the proper functioning of liver cells. Although the mechanism is unclear, mutations in the ATP8B1 gene result in the buildup of bile acids in liver cells. The imbalance of bile acids leads to the signs and symptoms of BRIC1.\nThe ABCB11 gene provides instructions for making a protein called the bile salt export pump (BSEP). This protein is found in the liver, and its main role is to move bile salts (a component of bile) out of liver cells. Mutations in the ABCB11 gene result in a reduction of BSEP function. This reduction leads to a decrease of bile salt secretion, which causes the features of BRIC2.\nThe factors that trigger episodes of BRIC are unknown.\nSome people with BRIC do not have a mutation in either the ATP8B1 or ABCB11 gene. In these individuals, the cause of the condition is unknown.\nBoth types of BRIC are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\nSome people with BRIC have no family history of the disorder. These cases arise from mutations in the ATP8B1 or ABCB11 gene that occur in the body's cells after conception and are not inherited.\n\n【4】 # Epidemiology and Demographics\nBRIC is a rare disorder. Although the prevalence is unknown, this condition is less common than the related disorder PFIC, which affects approximately 1 in 50,000 to 100,000 people worldwide.\n\n【5】 # Diagnosis\n\n【6】 ## History and symptoms\nThe first episode of cholestasis usually occurs in an affected person's teens or twenties. An attack typically begins with severe itchiness, followed by yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes a few weeks later. Other general signs and symptoms that occur during these episodes include a vague feeling of discomfort, irritability, nausea, vomiting, and a lack of appetite. A common feature of BRIC is the reduced absorption of fat in the body, which leads to excess fat in the feces. Because of a lack of fat absorption and loss of appetite, affected individuals often lose weight during episodes of cholestasis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

A nonpneumonia ARI hospitalization was defined as a record with any of the following ICD-9-CM codes assigned as the primary diagnosis: 381-383 (otitis media and mastoiditis), 460-466 (acute respiratory infections, including acute bronchitis, bronchiolitis, acute nasopharyngitis, sinusitis, pharyngitis, tonsillitis, laryngitis, tracheitis, and other acute upper respiratory infections), 487 (influenza, excluding 487., 490 (bronchitis), 491 (chronic bronchitis), or 493 (asthma).#\n declined after introduction of PCV7, indicating that the decreases in pneumonia hospitalizations likely were not the result of a shift in coding of respiratory hospitalizations to nonpneumonia ARI codes. In addition, the analysis suggests that the declines were unlikely to result from a reduction in total hospitalization rates. The transient increase in all-cause pneumonia rates from 2004 to 2005 might reflect increased circulation of respiratory viruses or other seasonal variation.\nAlthough many nonpneumonia ARI diagnoses traditionally have not been considered manifestations of S. pneumoniae infection, recent data indicate that the pneumococcus might contribute to a wider range of childhood respiratory illness than previously thought. A randomized clinical trial performed in child care centers in Israel suggested that immunization with a 9-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine reduced reported episodes of upper respiratory infections, lower respiratory infections, and otitis media by 15%, 16%, and 17%, respectively . Furthermore, in a trial of 9-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine among South African children, vaccinated children had 45% fewer influenza A-associated pneumonia episodes than unvaccinated children, suggesting that S. pneumoniae might be a copathogen in illnesses diagnosed as influenza .\n have decreased since introduction of PCV7 . In addition, the proportion of all hospitalizations that were attributo pneumonia or nonpneumonia ARI decreased significantly, suggesting that the declines were unlikely to result from a secular reduction in overall hospitalization rate.\n might reduce pneumonia hospitalization rates .  . Although only 1%-4% of those infected with LACV develop any symptoms, children aged <16 years are at highest risk for severe neurologic disease and possible long-term sequelae  antibodies in umbilical cord serum at delivery. The infant was born healthy with normal neurologic and cognitive functions and no LACV symptoms. Further investigation is needed to confirm the potential for intrauterine LACV transmission and to identify immediate and long-term health risks posed to infants. Because of the potential for congenital infection, pregnant women in areas where LACV is endemic should be advised to avoid mosquitoes; health-care providers should monitor for LACV infection and sequelae among infants born to women infected with LACV during pregnancy.\nIn August 2006, a previously healthy woman aged 43 years in week 21 of her pregnancy was admitted to a West Virginia hospital after experiencing severe headaches, photophobia, stiff neck, fever, weakness, confusion, and a red papular rash. The patient had reported a 3-month history of severe headaches, which were diagnosed initially as migraines and treated with morphine for pain. Two previous pregnancies had proceeded without complication, and each resulted in delivery of a healthy infant. The patient's medical history included anxiety, depression, and hypothyroidism, for which she received ongoing thyroid hormone replacement therapy.\nAfter hospital admission, analysis of cerebrospinal fluid revealed an elevated white blood cell count (556 cells/mm , elevated protein (66 mg/dL), and normal glucose (55 mg/dL). A diagnostic panel for viral encephalitis was performed, and the patient's serum was determined positive for the presence of LACVspecific IgM and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies by immunofluorescence assay and for IgM by capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) . The patient's serum was negative for IgM and IgG antibodies to the other three diseases in the diagnostic panel: eastern equine encephalitis, western equine encephalitis, and St. Louis encephalitis. A diagnosis of La Crosse encephalitis was made, and supportive therapy was initiated. During hospitalization, the patient experienced a low-grade fever and exhibited panleukocytosis (absolute neutrophil count: 12,800/µL), which persisted after discharge despite resolution of clinical signs.\n were tested for neutralizing antibodies to the closely related Jamestown Canyon virus by PRNT to rule out potential cross-reactivity. Umbilical cord and placental tissue were tested for LACV RNA by reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Data were collected regarding the infant's health at delivery and through routine well-child visits during the first 6 months of life.\n LACV-specific IgM antibodies were detected in umbilical cord serum, although no evidence of LACV RNA was detected in umbilical cord tissue or placental tissue by RT-PCR .\nThe mother declined collection of additional specimens of infant serum for confirmation of congenital LACV infection. Maternal serum collected at 11 weeks postpartum was positive for LACV IgG antibodies but negative for IgM. Except for intermittent nasal congestion associated with upper respiratory infections, the infant remained healthy and exhibited appropriate growth and development through the first 6 months of life. No neurologic abnormalities or decreased cognitive functions were observed. Editorial Note: This report summarizes the first case of symptomatic LACV infection identified during pregnancy. Congenital LACV infection of the fetus was suggested through identification of IgM antibodies in umbilical cord serum, although the newborn was asymptomatic and development was normal. Although unlikely to cross the placental barrier, LACV IgM antibodies detected in cord serum might have been attributo transplacental leakage induced by uterine contractions that disrupt placental barriers during labor, which has been documented for anti-Toxoplasma IgM antibodies . Because specificity of standard laboratory techniques used to detect LACV IgM antibodies in cord serum or newborn serum is unknown, a follow-up evaluation of infant serum is necessary to confirm congenital infection. However, in this case, the mother declined collection of any additional specimens from her infant.\nCertain infectious diseases have more severe clinical presentations in pregnant women . Symptomatic LACV infection is rare among adults; therefore, effects of pregnancy on the risk for or severity of illness are unknown. Because LACV-specific IgM can be present for as long as 9 months after infection , LACV might not have been responsible for the symptoms reported during this woman's pregnancy. However, the woman resided in an area where LACV is known to be endemic; during 2006, 16 (24%) of 67 LACV cases in the United States reported to CDC occurred in West Virginia, including three other cases from the same county as this patient.  Although antimicrobial treatment of pregnant women often is controversial because of limited information regarding efficacy and risk to the developing infant , certain in vitro evidence indicates that the antiviral agent ribavirin might be useful for treating LACV infection in nonpregnant patients . However, supportive treatment continues as the standard of care for managing all LACV patients .\nCongenital infection with other arboviral diseases has been reviewed and documented previously . Although no human congenital infection with a bunyavirus of the California serogroup has been reported, congenital infection with other bunyaviruses of the Bunyamwera serogroup has been associated with macrocephaly. In addition, animal studies have determined that infection with LACV during pregnancy can cause teratogenic effects in domestic rabbits, Mongolian gerbils, and sheep .\n might be reasonable to evaluate the potential for maternal-infant transmission and to determine the suitability for continued breastfeeding. Additional investigations are needed to confirm the potential for congenital infection with LACV and to identify immediate and long-term health risks LACV poses to infants.\n\n【1】 # Updated Guidelines for the Use of Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests in the Diagnosis of Tuberculosis\nGuidelines for the use of nucleic acid amplification (NAA) tests for the diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) were published in 1996  and updated in 2000 . Since then, NAA testing has become a routine procedure in many settings because NAA tests can reliably detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria in specimens 1 or more weeks earlier than culture . Earlier laboratory confirmation of TB can lead to earlier treatment initiation, improved patient outcomes, increased opportunities to interrupt transmission, and more effective public health interventions .\n\n【2】 # Background\nConventional tests for laboratory confirmation of TB include acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear microscopy, which can produce results in 24 hours, and culture, which requires 2-6 weeks to produce results .\n have been used clinically (e.g., NAA tests based on analyte specific reagents, often called \"home-brew\" or \"in-house\" tests) .\nCompared with AFB smear microscopy, the added value of NAA testing lies in its  greater positive predictive value (>95%) with AFB smear-positive specimens in settings in which nontuberculous mycobacteria are common and  ability to confirm rapidly the presence of M. tuberculosis in 50%-80% of AFB smear-negative, culture-positive specimens (3,. Compared with culture, NAA tests can detect the presence of M. tuberculosis bacteria in a specimen weeks earlier than culture for 80%-90% of patients suspected to have pulmonary TB whose TB is ultimately confirmed by culture . These advantages can impact patient care and TB control efforts, such as by avoiding unnecessary contact investigations or respiratory isolation for patients whose AFB smear-positive specimens do not contain M. tuberculosis.\nDespite being commercially available for more than a decade , NAA tests for TB have not been widely used in the United States largely because of  an uncertainty as to whether NAA test results influence case-management decisions or TB control activities;  a lack of information on the overall costeffectiveness of NAA testing for TB; and  a lack of demand from clinicians and public health authorities. However, recent studies showed that  clinicians already rely on the NAA test result as the deciding factor for the initiation of therapy for 20%-50% of TB cases in settings where NAA testing is a routine practice .\nIn response to the increasing demand for NAA testing for TB and recognition of the importance of prompt laboratory results in TB diagnosis and control, ACET requested that APHL and CDC convene a panel to evaluate the available information (e.g., current practices, existing guidelines, and publications) and to propose new guidelines for the use of NAA tests for TB diagnosis. The panel met in June 2008 and included TB clinicians; TB control officials; laboratory directors or supervisors from small, medium, and large public health laboratories, hospital laboratories, and commercial laboratories; and representatives from the TB Regional Training and Medical Consultation Centers, ACET, APHL, and CDC. In brief, the panel recommended  that NAA testing become a standard practice in the United States to aid in the initial diagnosis of patients suspected to have TB, rather than just being a reasonable approach, as suggested in previously published guidelines . On the basis of the panel's report and consultations with ACET, CDC developed revised guidelines.\n\n【3】 # Updated Recommendation\nNAA testing should be performed on at least one respiratory specimen from each patient with signs and symptoms of pulmonary TB for whom a diagnosis of TB is being considered but has not yet been established, and for whom the test result would alter case management or TB control activities. The following testing and interpretation algorithm is proposed.  .\n\n【4】 # Revised Testing and Interpretation Algorithm\n\n【5】 # Cautions\n can help reduce inappropriate use of fluoroquinolones as empiric monotherapy of pneumonias, a practice which is suspected to lead to development of fluoroquinolone-resistant M. tuberculosis and delays in initiating appropriate anti-TB therapy .\nTo maximize benefits of NAA testing, the interval from specimen collection to communication of the laboratory report to the treating clinician should be as brief as possible. NAA test results should be available within 48 hours of specimen collection. Laboratorians should treat an initial positive NAA test result as a critical test value, immediately report the result to the clinician and public health authorities, and be available for consultation regarding test interpretation and the possible need for additional testing.\nAlthough NAA testing is recommended to aid in the initial diagnosis of persons suspected to have TB, the currently available NAA tests should not be ordered routinely when the clinical suspicion of TB is low, because the positive predictive value of the NAA test is <50% for such cases . Clinicians, laboratorians, and TB control officials should be aware of the appropriate uses of NAA tests.\nClinicians should interprlaboratory results on the basis of the clinical situation. A single negative NAA test result should not be used as a definitive result to exclude TB, especially when the clinical suspicion of TB is moderate to high. Rather, the negative NAA test result should be used as additional information in making clinical decisions, to expedite testing for an alternative diagnosis, or to prevent unnecessary TB treatment. Consultation with a TB expert should be considered if the clinician is not experienced in the interpretation of NAA tests or the diagnosis and treatment of TB.\nAlthough FDA-approved NAA tests for TB are eligible for Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement, the costs of adding NAA testing to the routine testing of respiratory specimens from patients suspected to have TB might be considerable (e.g., operating costs exceed $100 per MTD test) . However, NAA testing has the potential to provide overall cost savings to the treatment center and TB control program through reduced costs for isolation, reduced costs of contact investigations of persons who do not have TB, and increased opportunities to prevent transmission. Within the parameters of these guidelines, each TB control or treatment program should evaluate the overall costs and benefits of NAA testing in deciding the value and optimal use of the test in their setting.\nBecause the testing algorithm includes NAA testing of AFB smear-negative specimens, laboratories must use an FDA-approved test for such specimens or a test produced and validated in accordance with applicable FDA and Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) regulations.  However, the performance of in-house tests or FDA-approved tests used for nonapproved indications (off-label use) is variable , and insufficient information is available to provide recommendations on the use of such tests for the diagnosis of TB. Their use should be guided by the clinical context, and the results of such tests should be interpreted on the basis of performance in the local laboratory and in validation studies.\nFor procedural and economic reasons, NAA testing might be impractical in laboratories with a small volume of testing. Referral of samples for NAA testing to high-volume laboratories might be preferable to improve cost-efficiency, proficiency, and turnaround times. The New York and Florida Fast Track Programs are successful NAA testing services that could serve as models for a regional service .\nInformation is limited regarding NAA test performance for nonrespiratory specimens or specimens from patients under treatment . NAA results often remain positive after culture results become negative during therapy. Further research is needed before specific recommendations can be made on the use of NAA testing in the diagnosis of extrapulmonary TB and TB in children who cannot produce sputum; however, evidence exists for the utility of such testing in individual cases .\nThese guidelines do not address the use of molecular tests for detecting drug resistance, which is an urgent public health and diagnostic need. No molecular drug-susceptibility tests (DSTs) have been approved by FDA for use in the United States, although well-characterized molecular DSTs are commercially available in Europe and elsewhere.  Nonetheless, a proposed revision of the Diagnostic Standards and Classification of Tuberculosis in Adults and Children  is likely to support the use of molecular DSTs for AFB smear-positive sputum sediments from TB patients who are suspected to have drugresistant disease or who are from a region or population with a high prevalence of drug resistance.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

These salts, e.g. potassium manganate, are the conjugate base of the hypothetical species manganic acid, H2MnO4.  Manganate salts are intermediates in the industrial synthesis of potassium permanganate.  Occasionally permanganate and manganate salts are confused, but they behave quite differently.\n\n【1】 # Structure\nMnO42− is tetrahedral, being structurally related to other tetrahedral oxides such permanganate and osmium tetroxide.  Salts of MnO42−, SO42−, and CrO42− are usually isostructural or nearly so, which means that they form solid solutions and have similar solubilities.  Unlike sulfate and chromate, however, MnO42− is paramagnetic.\n\n【2】 # Synthesis\n potassium manganate\nManganate ion is sin water only under strongly basic conditions. Consequently, salts are found with electropositive metals, such as Na+, K+, and Ba2+ that do not form insoluble hydroxides.  Manganates can be prepared by oxidation of MnO2 or by reduction of permanganate.\nNote that O2 is insufficiently oxidizing to further convert Mn(VI) to Mn(VII).  Thus, the Mn(VI)/Mn(VII) oxidation is effected using stronger oxidants including O3 or Cl2.\n\n【3】 # Reactions\nMnO42− is the conjugate base of the hypothetical manganic acid, H2MnO4, which is too unsto be isolated.  The half-deprotonated acid has, however, been examined.  Thus, the pKa of HMnO4− has been determined as 7.1.  MnO42− is about 100 times more basic than the acetate ion.  At lower pH's, the manganate ion will disproportionate to permanganate ion and manganese dioxi\n\n【4】 # Permanganate, manganate, hypomanganate, and manganite\n been generated by treatment of KMnO4 in 10M KOH with H2O2.  The pKa of HMnO42− is 13.7, which indicates that solutions of hypomanganate contain significant amounts of the protonated form even at high pH's.  Oxidations of alkenes by permanganate are proposed to proceed via the intermediacy of \"esters\" of hypomanganate, that is, species of the type MnO22− where R is an alkyl group.\nThe brown-colored manganite ion, a Mn(IV) species, in turn is produced by dissolving its parent acid anhydride MnO2 in strong alkali.  Alternatively, MnO44− can be generated by reduction of MnO43−.\n\n【5】 # Uses\nBaMnO4 and K2MnO4 are used to oxidize primary and secondary alcohols.  Primary alcohols are oxidised to aldehydes, then carboxylic acids. Secondary alcohols are oxidised to ketones. Tertiary alcohols cannot be oxidised in this way. Its use is similar to that for the Jones reagent.\n\n【6】 # Literature cited\n- ^ Nyholm R.S. Woolliams P.R. . \"\"Manganates(VI)\"\". Inorganic Syntheses.

The laser is then used to cut the resected tissue into smaller pieces before their removal.\nA further evolution of the procedure is holmium laser enucleation of the prostate, in which the intact prostatic lobes are removed with the holmium laser and then passed into the bladder where they are cut into smaller pieces before removal.\n\n【4】 # Efficacy\nThe studies reviewed showed that holmium laser prostatectomy is at least as effective as TURP at improving bladder neck obstruction, symptom scores and quality of life. Duration of catheterisation and hospital stay were reported to be shorter than for TURP. However, the studies were characterised by short follow-up periods and small sample sizes. For more details refer to 'Sources of evidence'.\nThe Specialist Advisors considered holmium laser prostatectomy to be established practice and preferable in many cases to TURP, requiring a shorter stay in hospital. Some Specialist Advisors were concerned about the completeness of evacuation of debris from the bladder after the procedure.\n\n【5】 # Safety\nThe studies revealed no significant differences in safety between holmium laser prostatectomy and TURP. Blood loss was reported to be lower with holmium laser prostatectomy than with TURP. For more details refer to 'Sources of evidence'.\n noted that there was less blood loss with this procedure than with TURP.# Further information\n\n【6】  of evidence\nThe evidence considered by the Interventional Procedures Advisory Committee is described in the interventional procedure overview of holmium laser prostatectomy.\n\n【7】 # Information for patients\nNICE has produced information for patients and carers on this procedure. It explains the nature of the procedure and the guidance issued by NICE, and has been written with patient consent in mind.# Other NICE recommendations on holmium laser prostatectomy\nFurther recommendations have been made as part of the clinical guideline on lower urinary tract symptoms published in May 2010, as follows:\nIf offering surgery for managing voiding lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) presumed secondary to benign prostatic enlargement (BPE), offer monopolar or bipolar transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), monopolar transurethral vaporisation of the prostate (TUVP) or holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP). Perform HoLEP at a centre specialising in the technique, or with mentorship arrangements in place.\nClinical and cost-effectiveness evidence was reviewed in the development of this guideline which has led to this more specific recommendation. More information about this guideline is available in NICE's guideline on lower urinary tract symptoms in men on the NICE website.\nThe IP guidance on holmium laser prostatectomy remains current, and should be read in conjunction with the clinical guideline.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

The defect may be anterior (Morgagni's hernia) or posterolateral (Bochdalek hernia). Migration of abdominal organs into the thoracic cavity, pulmonary hypoplasia and respiratory failure at birth can occur.\nCurrent management of CDH in neonates usually involves initial ventilatory support and supportive care, to allow labile cardiopulmonary physiology to improve, followed by surgical reduction of the hernia, usually through an abdominal approach, and repair of the diaphragmatic defect.\n\n【4】 # Outline of the procedure\nThe aim of this procedure is to reduce the herniated abdominal organs and repair the diaphragmatic defect. It is normally carried out for posterolateral Bochdalek defects.\nThoracoscopic repair of CDH in neonates is carried out with the patient under general anaesthesia and in the lateral decubitus position. Between 2 and 4 trocars can be used, with CO2 insufflation of the pleural space to partially collapse the lung sufficiently to achieve good exposure of the defect and to reduce the herniated viscera within the abdomen. Following reduction, the diaphragm is repaired using non-absorbable interrupted sutures or patches (if defects are relatively large). Where technically possible, posterolateral diaphragm stitches are passed around the ribs and tied extracorporeally. Patients usually require temporary chest drain insertion and ventilatory support.\ns 2.3 and 2.4 describe efficacy and safety outcomes from the published literature that the Committee considered as part of the evidence about this procedure.

It aims to improve the diagnosis and management of infective gastroenteritis and appropriate escalation of care.\n\n【2】 # Introduction\nInfective gastroenteritis in young children is characterised by the sudden onset of diarrhoea, with or without vomiting. Most cases are due to an enteric virus, but some are caused by bacterial or protozoal infections. The illness usually resolves without treatment within days; however, symptoms are unpleasant and affect both the child and family or carers. Severe diarrhoea can quickly cause dehydration, which may be life threatening.\nGastroenteritis is very common, with many children having more than one episode a year. Parents and carers often manage their child's illness at home, and may not seek professional advice. However, many parents and carers do seek advice from healthcare professionals either remotely . In a UK study, diarrhoeal illness accounted for 16% of medical presentations to a major paediatric emergency department . Although most children with gastroenteritis do not need to be admitted to hospital, many are treated as inpatients each year and often remain in hospital for several days – thereby exposing other vulnerable hospitalised children to the illness. Gastroenteritis is a significant burden on health service resources.\nThe management of gastroenteritis in children is multifaceted. There is evidence of variation in clinical practice, which may have a major impact on the use of healthcare resources.\n considers when care should be escalated – from home management through to hospital admission.\nThe guideline will assume that prescribers will use a drug's summary of product characteristics to inform their decisions for individual patients.# Recommendations\nPeople have the right to be involved in discussions and make informed decisions about their care, as described in NICE's information on making decisions about your care.\nMaking decisions using NICE guidelines explains how we use words to show the strength (or certainty) of our recommendations, and has information about prescribing medicines (including off-label use), professional guidelines, standards and laws (including on consent and mental capacity), and safeguarding.\nThe following guidance is based on the best available evidence. The full guideline gives details of the methods and the evidence used to develop the guidance.\nFor the purposes of this guideline, an 'infant' is defined as a child younger than 1 year. 'Remote assessment' refers to situations in which a child is assessed by a healthcare professional who is unable to examine the child because the child is geographically remote from the assessor (for example, telephone calls to NHS Direct).\n\n【3】 # Diagnosis\n\n【4】 ## Clinical diagnosis\nSuspect gastroenteritis if there is a sudden change in stool consistency to loose or watery stools, and/or a sudden onset of vomiting.\nIf you suspect gastroenteritis, ask about:\nrecent contact with someone with acute diarrhoea and/or vomiting and\nexposure to a known source of enteric infection (possibly contaminated water or food) and\nrecent travel abroad.\nBe aware that in children with gastroenteritis:\ndiarrhoea usually lasts for 5–7 days, and in most it stops within 2 weeks\nvomiting usually lasts for 1–2 days, and in most it stops within 3 days.\nConsider any of the following as possible indicators of diagnoses other than gastroenteritis:\nfever:\ntemperature of 38°C or higher in children younger than 3 months\ntemperature of 39°C or higher in children aged 3 months or older\nshortness of breath or tachypnoea\naltered conscious state\nneck stiffness\nbulging fontanelle in infants\nnon-blanching rash\nblood and/or mucus in stool\nbilious (green) vomit\nsevere or localised abdominal pain\nabdominal distension or rebound tenderness.\n\n【5】 ## Laboratory investigations\nConsider performing stool microbiological investigations if:\nthe child has recently been abroad or\nthe diarrhoea has not improved by day 7 or\nthere is uncertainty about the diagnosis of gastroenteritis.\nPerform stool microbiological investigations if:\nyou suspect septicaemia or\nthere is blood and/or mucus in the stool or\nthe child is immunocompromised.\nNotify and act on the advice of the public health authorities if you suspect an outbreak of gastroenteritis.\nIf stool microbiology is performed:\ncollect, store and transport stool specimens as advised by the investigating laboratory\nprovide the laboratory with relevant clinical information.\nPerform a blood culture if giving antibiotic therapy.\nIn children with Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) infection, seek specialist advice on monitoring for haemolytic uraemic syndrome.\n\n【6】 # Assessing dehydration and shock\n\n【7】 ## Clinical assessment\nDuring remote or face-to-face assessment ask whether the child:\nappears unwell\nhas altered responsiveness, for example is irrior lethargic\nhas decreased urine output\nhas pale or mottled skin\nhas cold extremities.\nRecognise that the following are at increased risk of dehydration:\nchildren younger than 1 year, particularly those younger than 6 months\ninfants who were of low birth weight\nchildren who have passed more than five diarrhoeal stools in the previous 24 hours\nchildren who have vomited more than twice in the previous 24 hours\nchildren who have not been offered or have not been able to tolerate supplementary fluids before presentation\ninfants who have stopped breastfeeding during the illness\nchildren with signs of malnutrition.\nUse  to detect clinical dehydration and shock.\n\n【8】 ##  Symptoms and signs of clinical dehydration and shock\nInterpret symptoms and signs taking risk factors for dehydration into account  recommendation 1.2.1.. Within the category of 'clinical dehydration' there is a spectrum of severity indicated by increasingly numerous and more pronounced symptoms and signs. For clinical shock, one or more of the symptoms and/or signs listed would be expected to be present. Dashes (–) indicate that these clinical features do not specifically indicate shock. Symptoms and signs with red flags may help to identify children at increased risk of progression to shock.

Communicable Disease and Public Health 7:362–384.# Recommendations for research\nThe Guideline Development Group has made the following recommendations for research, based on its review of evidence, to improve NICE guidance and patient care in the future. The Guideline Development Group's full set of recommendations for research is detailed in the full guideline  section .\n\n【22】 # Assessing dehydration and shock\n\n【23】 ## Why this is important\nEvidence from a systematic review  suggests that some symptoms and signs (for example, prolonged capillary refill time, abnormal skin turgor and abnormal respiratory pattern) are associated with dehydration, measured using the accepted 'gold standard' of the difference between pre-hydration and post-hydration weight. However, 10 of the 13 included studies were not blinded and had ill-defined selection criteria. Moreover, all these studies were conducted in secondary care where children with more severe dehydration are managed.\nMost children with gastroenteritis can and should be managed in the community  but there is a lack of evidence to help primary care healthcare professionals correctly identify children with more severe dehydration. Symptoms and signs that researchers may wish to investigate include overall appearance, irritability or lethargy, urine output, sunken eyes, absence of tears, changes in skin colour or warmth of extremities, dry mucous membranes, depressed fontanelle, heart rate, respiratory rate and effort, character of peripheral pulses, capillary refill time, skin turgor and blood pressure.\n\n【24】 # Administration of ORS solution by nasogastric tube\nIn children who do not tolerate oral rehydration therapy, is ORS solution administration via nasogastric tube cost effective, safe and accepin treating dehydration compared with intravenous fluid therapy?\n\n【25】 ## Why this is important\nOral rehydration therapy is normally preferable to intravenous fluid therapy for rehydration in children with gastroenteritis. However, some children may not tolerate oral rehydration therapy, either because they are unable to drink ORS solution in adequate quantities or because they persistently vomit. In such cases, ORS solution could be administered via a nasogastric tube, rather than changing to intravenous fluid therapy. This overcomes the problem of ORS solution refusal. Continuous infusion of ORS solution via a nasogastric tube might reduce the risk of vomiting. A well-conducted randomised controlled trial is needed to assess the cost effectiveness, safety and acceptability of rehydration using nasogastric tube administration of ORS solution compared with intravenous fluid therapy.\n\n【26】 # Fluid management\nIn children who require intravenous fluid therapy for the treatment of dehydration, is rapid rehydration safe and cost effective compared with the common practice of rehydration over 24 hours?\n\n【27】 ## Why this is important\nMost children with clinical dehydration should be treated with oral rehydration therapy, but some require intravenous fluid therapy because they are shocked or they cannot tolerate oral rehydration therapy. Rehydration with oral rehydration therapy is usually carried out over a period of 4 hours. Rehydration with intravenous fluid therapy has traditionally been undertaken slowly – typically over 24 hours. The National Patient Safety Agency has advised that intravenous fluid deficit replacement should be over 24 hours or longer. ( Consequently, children will remain dehydrated and in hospital for a prolonged period. The World Health Organization's manual for physicians and other senior health workers on the treatment of diarrhoea recommends that intravenous rehydration should be completed in 3 to 6 hours. Many experts now support rapid intravenous rehydration, suggesting that it allows oral fluids to be starter earlier and can shorten the duration of hospital treatment. Randomised controlled trials are needed urgently to examine the safety and cost effectiveness of rapid intravenous rehydration regimens compared with slow intravenous rehydration.\n\n【28】 # Other therapies: ondansetron\nIn children with persistent vomiting caused by gastroenteritis, is oral ondansetron cost effective and safe compared with placebo therapy?\n\n【29】 ## Why this is important\n be undertaken to evaluate its use in primary care.\n\n【30】 # Other therapies: probiotics\nAre probiotics effective and safe compared with a placebo in the treatment of children with gastroenteritis in the UK? Which specific probiotic is most effective and in what specific treatment regimen?\n\n【31】 ## Why this is important\nThe available studies of probiotic therapy frequently report benefits, particularly in terms of reduced duration of diarrhoea or stool frequency. However, most of the published studies have methodological limitations. Moreover, there is great variation in the specific probiotics evaluated and in the treatment regimens used. Many of these studies were conducted in developing countries where the response to probiotic therapy may differ. Good-quality randomised controlled trials should be conducted in the UK to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of specific probiotics, using clearly defined treatment regimens and outcome measures.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

According to a 2009 meta-analysis of 12 second-generation antidepressants, reboxetine was no more effective than placebo, and was \"significantly less\" effective, and less accep, than the other drugs in treating the acute-phase of adults with unipolar major depression.\nThe British MHRA said in September 2011 that the study had several limitations, and that \"Overall the balance of benefits and risks for reboxetine remains positive in its authorised indication.\" A UK and Europe-wide review of available efficacy and safety data has confirmed that reboxetine has benefit over placebo in its authorised indication. Efficacy was clearly shown in patients with severe or very severe depression.\n showed that nearly three quarters of the data on patients who took part in trials of reboxetine were not published by Pfizer until now.\n\n【3】 ## Panic disorder\nIn a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial reboxetine significantly improved the symptoms of panic disorder. Another randomised controlled trial that compared paroxetine to reboxetine found that paroxetine significantly outperformed reboxetine as a treatment for panic disorder. Despite this discouraging finding an open-label trial examining the efficacy of reboxetine in SSRI-resistant panic disorder demonstrated significant benefit from reboxetine treatment.\n\n【4】 ## Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder\nNumerous clinical trials have provided support for the efficacy of reboxetine in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in both the short and long-term and in both children/adolescents and adults.\n\n【5】 ## Other uses\n attenuate olanzapine-induced weight gain.\n\n【6】 # Adverse effects\nIncidence of adverse effects\nVery common (>10% incidence) adverse effects inclu\n- Insomnia\n- Nausea\n- Excessive sweating\n- Dry mouth\n- Constipation\nCommon (1-10%) adverse effects inclu\n- Appetite loss\n- Agitation\n- Anxiety\n- Headache\n- Dizziness\n- Paraesthesia\n- Akathisia\n- Dysgeusia\n- Accommodation disorder\n- Tachycardia\n- Palpitations\n- Vasodilatation\n- Hypotension (low blood pressure)\n- Hypertension (high blood pressure)\n- Vomiting\n- Rash\n- Sensation of incomplete bladder emptying\n- Urinary tract infection\n- Dysuria (painful or very difficult urination)\n- Urinary retention\n- Chills\n- Erectile dysfunction\n- Ejaculatory pain\n- Ejaculatory delay\nUncommon (0.1-1%) adverse effects inclu\n- Mydriasis\n- Vertigo\nRare (<0.1%) adverse effects inclu\n- Glaucoma\nUnknown frequency adverse effects inclu\n- Hyponatraemia (low blood sodium)\n- Aggressive behaviour\n- Hallucination\n- Suicidal Ideation/behaviour\n- Increased intraocular pressure\n- Peripheral coldness\n- Raynaud`s phenomenon\n- Allergic dermatitis\n- Testicular pain\n- Irritability\nOverall in the aforementioned 2009 meta-analysis reboxetine was significantly less well-tolerated than the other 11 second-generation antidepressants compared in the analysis.\n\n【7】 ## Contraindications\nReboxetine is contraindicated in narrow-angle glaucoma, cardiovascular disease, epilepsy, bipolar disorder, urinary retention, prostatic hypertrophy, patients concomitantly on MAOIs and those hypersensitive to reboxetine or any of its excipients.\n\n【8】 ## Interactions\nBecause of its reliance on CYP3A4, reboxetine O-desethylation is markedly inhibited by papaverine and ketoconazole. It weakly inhibits CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. Reboxetine is an intermediate-level inhibitor of P-glycoprotein, which gives it the potential to interact with ciclosporin, tacrolimus, paroxetine, sertraline, quinidine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine.\n\n【9】 ## Overdose\nReboxetine is considered a relatively low-risk antidepressant in overdose. The symptoms are as follows:\n- Sweating\n- Tachycardia\n- Changes in blood pressure\n\n【10】 # Pharmacology\nPharmacodynamics\nReboxetine is a fairly selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (NRI) with approximately 20.4x selectivity for the norepinephrine transporter over the serotonin transporter. Despite this selectivity reboxetine does slightly inhibit the reuptake of serotonin at therapeutic doses.\nReboxetine has been found to inhibit both brain and cardiac GIRKs, a characteristic it shares with the norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor atomoxetine.\nBinding profile\nPharmacokinetics\nBoth the (R,R)-(–) and (S,S)-(+)-enantiomers of reboxetine are predominantly metabolized by the CYP3A4 isoenzyme.\n three minor metabolites—Phenol A, Phenol B, and UK1, Phenol B being the most minor.\n\n【11】 # Chemistry\nReboxetine has two chiral centers. Thus, four stereoisomers may exist, the (R,R)-, (S,S)-, (R,S)-, and (S,R)-isomers. The active ingredient of reboxetine is a racemic mixture of two enantiomers, the (R,R)-(–)- and (S,S)-(+)-isomer.\n\n【12】 # Society and culture\n\n【13】 ## Brand names\nEdronax is the brand name of reboxetine in every English-speaking country that has approved it for clinical use. Brand names include (where  denotes a product that is no longer marketed):\n- Davedax (IT)\n- Edronax (AU, AT, BE, CZ, DK, FI, DE, IE, IL, IT, MX, NZ, NO, PH, PL, PT, RU, ZA, SE, CH, TH, TR, UK)\n- Irenor (ES)\n- Norebox (ES)\n- Prolift (AR, BR, CL, VE)\n- Solvex (DE)\n- Yeluoshu (CN)\n- Zuolexin (CN)", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "df26eacd-8ec4-429f-b49c-80083ff2c7da", "title": null, "text": "【0】 Looked-after children and young people\n\n【1】 This guideline covers how organisations, practitioners and carers should work together to deliver high-quality care, splacements and nurturing relationships for looked-after children and young people. It aims to help these children and young people reach their full potential and have the same opportunities as their peers.\n\n【2】 # Context\nAs of 31 March 2020, there are 80,080 looked-after children and young people in England, with the total number of children being looked after increasing yearly since 2010. Most of the looked-after children are cared for in foster placements (72%), with 14% in connected care, and 13% in residential care, secure units or semi-independent living accommodation. In addition to these, 7% of looked-after children are placed with birth parents.\n include domestic abuse, serious harm, exposure in the home or community to alcohol, drug misuse or violence. All looked-after children and young people will have experienced trauma in some way.\nEvery child in care is a unique child with individual strengths and needs. However, the physical, emotional and mental health of some looked-after children and young people will have been compromised by neglect or abuse. The rate of mental health disorders in the general population aged 5 to 15 is 10%. However, for those who are looked after, it is 45%, and 72% for those in residential care. In addition, frequent placement moves can keep looked-after children and young people from receiving the support they need by disrupting treatment plans and access to services. Frequent placement moves are linked to poorer mental health and a lessened sense of belonging. Practitioners and services involved with the child need to work collaboratively to assess and review the child's needs and how these can best be met. Key statutory guidance for promoting the health and wellbeing of looked-after children is available from the Department for Education and the Department of Health and Social Care.\n at a greater risk of poor educational outcomes\nOnce a child or young person enters care, a suiplacement will be sought for them. Looked-after children leaving care most commonly return home to their birth parents (29%), but two-thirds of children who return home to birth parents re-enter care within 5 years. However, as of December 2019, although the number of children entering care has been rising year after year, the number of children ceasing to be looked after during the year due to adoption has been falling down to 3,570 from a peak of 5,360 in 2015. This has increased pressures on health and social care providers to continue to provide high-quality care with existing resources. Reductions in adoptions have been partially compensated for with increases in Special Guardianship Orders, which increased from 3,550 to 3,700 in the same period. Statutory support for the transition out of care into adoption, including preparing adopters and arranging contact, is outlined in the Department for Education's statutory guidance on adoption.\n have poorer outcomes on key measures such as housing, health, employment, and continuing in education and training post‑16\nLocal authorities have a statutory duty to support looked-after children and young people. Partners cooperate to produce individual care plans covering health, education and placement. In addition, clinical commissioning groups, NHS England and Public Health England have a statutory duty to support local authorities to meet their health needs. The Children Act 1989, Children Act 2004, Care Standards Act 2000, Care Planning, Placement and Case Review Regulations 2010, Children and Social Work Act 2017, Fostering Services Regulations 2011, Children and Adoption Act 2006 and accompanying regulations and statutory guidance provide the legal framework for local authorities, providers of fostering services and children's homes. Other relevant safeguarding legislation and statutory guidance includes the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006, Working Together to Safeguard Children 2018, Children's Act 1989 Guidance and Regulations and Keeping Children Safe in Education 2021.\nDespite the gap in health and educational outcomes between looked-after children and young people and the general population outlined above, research suggests that the longer children remain in care, the better they can improve in these areas. And, accounting for their disadvantages, they can do better than children not in care.\n recognises that looked-after children and young people experience inequality, and these recommendations seek to ensure that their needs are at the centre of any plans being made and are adequately met. This requires special attention and expertise.\nThe guideline covers support provided to looked-after children and young people and care leavers (from birth to age , and their families and carers (including birth parents, connected carers, prospective adoptive parents and special guardians). This includes all who are classed as 'looked-after' under a full or interim local authority care order, whether temporary or long term. For example, it covers looked-after children and young people on remand, those temporarily looked-after under section 20 of the Children Act 1989, and those preparing to leave care. The guideline covers all parts of the care pathway, from entry of looked-after people into the care system, to support provided when moving into permanency and out of care into independent living.\n does not cover those on the edge of care and their families.\nThe guideline committee wished to acknowledge that the impact of the COVID‑19 pandemic on looked-after children and young people's mental and emotional health and wellbeing, as well as their educational progress, cannot be underestimated.\nAlthough children and young people have been less affected by the virus than adults in terms of infection and mortality rates, the committee raised concerns about lost learning and greater safeguarding risks to this vulnerable group during lockdown. COVID‑19 has disrupted practitioners' relationships with children and families, and the longer-term impact on the voluntary and charisector is unknown.\n been increasingly delivered remotely using digital technology.\n led to more children being referred to children's services who had not previously been known to local authorities and children's social care, leading to a greater impact on the system.# Recommendations\nPeople have the right to be involved in discussions and make informed decisions about their care, as described in NICE's information on making decisions about your care.\nMaking decisions using NICE guidelines explains how we use words to show the strength (or certainty) of our recommendations, and has information about prescribing medicines (including off-label use), professional guidelines, standards and laws (including on consent and mental capacity), and safeguarding.\nThis guideline should be read alongside NICE's guideline on children's attachment.\n\n【3】 # Diversity\nBe aware that many looked-after children and young people are from groups that may face additional disadvantage. Ensure that their needs are met and that they do not face further marginalisation. These groups include those from black, Asian and other minority ethnic groups, Gypsy, Roma and Traveller communities, and those from different religious backgrounds, as well as other groups such as refugees and unaccompanied asylum-seeking children, disabled people with complex needs, autistic children and young people, children and young people with a learning disability or neurodevelopmental disability, lower socioeconomic groups and people who identify as LGBTQ+.\nFor a short explanation of why the committee made this recommendation and how it might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on diversity .\nFull details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review D: barriers and facilitators for supporting positive relationships among looked-after children and young people.\n\n【4】 # Supporting positive relationships\n\n【5】 ## Positive relationships in the care network\nEnsure that the care network around a looked-after child or young person consists of positive relationships. These are characterised by:\ngenuine caring – being treated by carers as 'one of their own'\navailability – being there when needed\nreliability – providing promised support in a timely manner\nlistening that is engaged and non-judgemental\ncontinuity of relationships\npromoting agency and shared decision making that is appropriate to developmental age\nproviding well-communicated and fair discipline and boundaries\npersistence and understanding, to respond to behaviours that challenge and to support positive behaviours\npositive role models who offer guidance.\nIf the looked-after child or young person has speech, language and communication problems (whether or not these have been previously diagnosed), refer them to speech and language therapists, if needed, for assessment and for advice on how to communicate effectively with them.\n\n【6】 ## Sibling relationships\nConsider interventions and support to improve the relationship between siblings in care, including biological siblings who live apart and non-biological siblings who live together (for example, other looked-after children or young people in the placement, and the carer's biological or adopted children). Take into account safeguarding issues and the looked-after child or young person's preferences.\nFor primary-school-aged children, or those needing greater assistance, ensure that the primary carers are present during interventions to improve relationships between siblings in care. Components of this intervention should inclu\nstructured conversation around relationships and conflict resolution\nincentivised cooperation, for example shared activities and outings to encourage prosocial, cooperative behaviour\nshared activities with coaching in prosocial skills using life story work.\nConsider relationship coaching independently from the carer for adolescent siblings in care.\nOffer carers support to help them understand and maintain ssibling relationships before offering interventions to improve the relationship between siblings in care.\n\n【7】 ## Relationships with the birth family\nRespect the wishes of looked-after children and young people about contact arrangements (where and who with) and take them into account when making plans. Balance them against safeguarding considerations and the risk of repeating trauma.\nProvide contact supervisors for contact with birth families if this is necessary for safeguarding, or if it will help support the relationship between the looked-after child or young person and the birth family. Ensure that the looked-after child or young person always has the same contact supervisor if possible.\nContact supervisors should receive training in:\nsafeguarding the looked-after child or young person, including trauma-informed training in recognising signs of distress (including in babies and in non-verbal children and young people) and how and when to end a session\nproviding emotional support for the looked-after child or young person, including in transition to and from contact with the birth family\nproviding support for and feedback to birth parents to help them build positive relationships during contact\nknowing when to support, and how to reduce support when necessary\nrecord keeping and sharing information with the broader care team.\nConsider the need for more intense contact supervision (in terms of monitoring and feedback provided) between the birth family and looked-after child or young person in the early stages of care placements, with reduced intensity as needs decrease over time.\nProvide interpreting services for contact supervisors if the people taking part in contact are non-English speaking. Consider any additional communication support as needed, for example sign language.\n take account of the possibility of ongoing unmonitored online contact and ensure that the time spent in digital or social media contact and the content of these interactions is appropriate.\nConsider the contact needs of children placed out of their local area – for example, additional support for the birth family to attend contact centres.\n\n【8】 ## Relationships with social workers\nSupport the looked-after child or young person's allocated social worker, to reduce professional turnover. Support could include, for example:\nsupervision with regular meetings to check on the wellbeing of workers, and reflect on practices that promote positive relationships  recommendation 1.2.\nconsultation for complex and specialist problems  recommendation 1.4.\n recommendation 1.3..\nManagers of social workers should use and review ways of working to reduce duplication of effort, increase staff retention and enable more one-to-one time between social workers and looked-after children and young people (for example, by improving administrative support).\nLocal authorities and partner agencies should collect and review data on staff turnover to assess the impact on looked-after children and young people and the success of existing staff support systems. They should use this data to inform action plans to support greater continuity of practitioners working directly with looked-after people and care leavers.\nIf possible, social workers should tell looked-after children, young people, care leavers, and primary carers pre-emptively, and in a manner appropriate to developmental age, about upcoming changes in their job that will affect their relationship with the looked-after child or young person. This should include a joint meeting in person between the previous and new social worker and the looked-after child or young person. Recognise the emotional impact of such changes and provide an opportunity to say goodbye.\n\n【9】 ## Mentoring\nConsider programmes (with professional oversight) to support mentoring relationships. For example, by pairing looked-after young people with near peers with care experience to provide positive role models, particularly for looked-after young people with social, emotional and mental wellbeing needs.\n\n【10】 ## Friendship\nTo support overnight stays with friends, ensure that safeguarding checks are completed in good time so as not to cause a barrier to relationships.\nConsider providing funding to support contact with friends (for example, for travel or activities), particularly for friendships that existed before the looked-after child or young person entered care.\n\n【11】 ## Placement stability\nProvide out-of-hours support services (separate from those provided for carers) for looked-after children and young people to help resolve urgent problems, and tell looked-after children and young people about these options. Services could be provided, for example, through social workers 'on call', voluntary or independent agency helplines or advocacy organisations.\nAdopt a proactive approach to identify children and young people who may be likely to present out-of-hours (for example, they may show early warning signs such as skipping school, lying or stealing), for whom out-of-hours support could be planned ahead of time.\nDiscuss the priorities and needs of carers sensitively and transparently with the looked-after child or young person in a manner appropriate to developmental age. For example, if placements are at risk of breakdown, social workers should facilitate communication between the carers and the looked-after child or young person (and birth parents if relevant) to try to resolve problems.\nIf a placement changes:\nDiscuss the reasons for this with the looked-after child or young person in a way they can understand and that is appropriate to their developmental age.\nOffer the child or young person emotional support, if possible by a practitioner they have an existing relationship with.\nUse ongoing life story work to help them process changes in placement.\nProvide the new carer with appropriate health information in good time before the new placement starts (for example, the health plan recommendations, any new health concerns, health contacts and upcoming health appointments).\n\n【12】 ## Serious behavioural problems\nConsider multidimensional treatment foster care for looked-after adolescents with a history of persistent offending behaviour.\nFor guidance on service design and delivery for learning disabilities and behaviour that challenges, see NICE's guideline on learning disabilities and behaviour that challenges.\n\n【13】 ## Disorganised attachment\nFor guidance on attachment difficulties, see the NICE guideline on children's attachment.\nFor a short explanation of why the committee made these recommendations and how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on supporting positive relationships .\nFull details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in:\nevidence review A: interventions to support care placement stability for looked-after children and young people\nevidence review B: barriers and facilitators for supporting care placement stability among looked-after children and young people\nevidence review C: interventions to support positive relationships for looked-after children, young people and care leavers\nevidence review D: barriers and facilitators for supporting positive relationships among looked-after children and young people\nevidence review F: interventions to promote physical, mental, and emotional health and wellbeing of looked-after children, young people and care leavers\nevidence review G: barriers and facilitators for promoting physical, mental and emotional health and wellbeing of looked-after children and young people and care leavers.\n\n【14】 # Valuing carers\nThese recommendations cover support for primary carers, including foster carers, connected carers, key workers in residential care and birth parents (when the looked-after child or young person is placed with the birth parent).\n\n【15】 ## Supporting and involving carers\nInvolve and value the carer's input in decision making in the broader care team, and keep carers fully informed about a looked-after child or young person's care plan.\nProvide out-of-hours support services for carers to help resolve urgent problems, for example through social workers working 'on call', emergency duty teams or out-of-hours service, voluntary or independent agency helplines, or carer peer support associations.\nEnsure that carers log any help sought outside of usual operational hours as part of their routine and urgent reports.\nFacilitate peer support for carers at accessible times and places, including online if people may find it difficult to attend a physical meeting.\nAs part of the care plan, think about the need for planned respite care (or 'support care') for carers.\nEnsure that respite (or support) care is used in the looked-after child or young person's best interests and explain this to the looked-after child or young person. For example, make use of short breaks that are fun for the child or young person, such as staying with relatives or extended carer family.\nUse a respite (or support care) carer who the child or young person is familiar with if possible, and take into account the skills or training needed to meet the looked-after child or young person's assessed need.\nKeep carers fully informed and updated about the support services available to carers and looked-after children and young people in their local authority.\nInform the looked-after child or young person's carers about any interventions used to support the looked-after child or young person, including the purpose of these interventions.\nFor further guidance on support for adult carers, follow the NICE guideline on supporting adult carers.\nFor a short explanation of why the committee made these recommendations and how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on supporting and involving carers .\nFull details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in:\nevidence review A: interventions to support care placement stability for looked-after children and young people\nevidence review B: barriers and facilitators for supporting care placement stability among looked-after children and young people.\n\n【16】 ## Training for carers\nPlan training for carers so that it is delivered before it is needed. Think about the need for multiagency involvement in training programmes and ensure that the organisations involved agree the source of funding between them.\nSupervising social workers should work with carers to assess the needs of the looked-after child or young person, to inform and tailor training and development needs for the carers.\nProvide a schedule of mandatory training for carers, excluding birth parents. Ensure that this training covers:\nTherapeutic, trauma-informed parenting (covering attachment-informed, highly supportive and responsive relational care).\nSafeguarding procedures.\nHow to communicate effectively and sensitively (for example, using de-escalation techniques).\nLife story work to promote a positive self-identity, which has a consistent, child-focused and planned approach  the section on life story work for identity and wellbeing).\nHow to be an educational advocate (this part of the training should be delivered by practitioners from the virtual school).\nIdentifying problems with, and supporting, good oral health, diet and personal hygiene (particularly among those coming into care).\nEncouraging positive relationships and sexual identity (covering issues such as consent, encouraging healthy intimate relationships, 'coming out' and transitioning).\nSelf-care for carers, preventing burnout and coping with placements ending.\nThe importance of health assessments, supporting attendance and issues of consent for medical treatment.\nRecord keeping and sharing the information in the record with the looked-after child or young person in a constructive and positive way, considering the need for confidentiality, and the impact the record may have on the looked-after child or young person. Training can be delivered in person (for example, at home or in community group settings) or virtually.\nProvide targeted support and training for birth parents if reunification is a possibility or if the child or young person is to remain in placement with the birth parent. This should be provided through transition planning with family support teams.\nThink about providing tailored training for carers if there are specific needs related to race, ethnicity and culture. This could include, for example, understanding and respecting cultural and religious identity (including dietary requirements or preferences), and understanding specific hair and skin care needs.\nProvide tailored training for carers if there are specific needs relating to special educational needs, long-term health conditions and disabilities, for example sensory and communication needs. Training could be provided through specialist healthcare teams and voluntary organisations.\nBased on the individual needs and developmental age of the looked-after child or young person, consider more intensive training methods for carers to support the delivery of therapeutic, trauma-informed caregiving. These methods should use video feedback, coaching and observation, role play, and follow-up booster sessions and be delivered by trained facilitators.\nEnsure that trauma-informed training covers:\nunderstanding behaviour as a form of communication and as a response to trauma\nunderstanding, recognising and processing triggers for trauma responses\nunderstanding attachment and loss.\nEnsure that trainers for carers are trauma informed and have a good understanding of attachment issues and therapeutic approaches.\nEnsure that new permanent or long-term carers are trained and prepared so that there is continuity of care and support, including therapeutic support if needed, between placements.\nFor a short explanation of why the committee made these recommendations and how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on training for carers .\nFull details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in:\nevidence review A: interventions to support care placement stability for looked-after children and young people\nevidence review B: barriers and facilitators for supporting care placement stability among looked-after children and young people\nevidence review C: interventions to support positive relationships for looked-after children, young people and care leavers.\n\n【17】 # Safeguarding\nLocal authorities should facilitate a multidisciplinary approach to safeguarding looked-after children and young people, recognising that, like other children, looked-after children may need a full safeguarding response despite already being in care. This approach should:\ninclude all relevant agencies in meetings to address safeguarding concerns\nfacilitate the sharing of data between agencies\nseek the views of looked-after children and young people and their carers, to ensure that responses to safeguarding risks are effective and accep, for example by coordinating safeguarding responses for siblings in care.\nHold safeguarding meetings to bring together practitioners from multiple agencies involved in the care and support of looked-after children and young people, such as: social care; fostering, residential and connected care; education and the virtual school; healthcare; voluntary agencies; housing services; emergency services; policing; and immigration.\nLocal authorities should seek specialist support to address safeguarding risks outside the home (contextual safeguarding), exploitation and children missing from care. This practitioner should lead and facilitate safeguarding meetings and build clear lines of accountability. The practitioner could be, for example, a missing person's coordinator or another trauma-informed specialist with knowledge of exploitation and safeguarding issues in the looked-after population.\nAssess the safeguarding risk of a looked-after child or young person using data shared across agencies. This could include data on vulnerabilities:\nat the individual level (such as those captured by risk-assessment tools)\nat the group level (red flags specific to subpopulations such as young girls and boys, trafficked children and unaccompanied asylum-seeking children)\nat the community level (gathered from community-level health and mental health data, area deprivation indexes, number of county lines operating in a single area and area-specific missing person reports).\nUse training and review meetings to ensure that practitioners and carers working directly with looked-after children and young people are:\nable to recognise critical moments for looked-after people; that is, times when they may be more open to change and receiving help\naware of the early signs of, and risk factors for, gang involvement, exploitation and going missing\nfamiliar with how to report concerns.\nPromote positive relationships (including broader relationships such as those with carers, siblings and practitioners) as the main way to prevent exploitation and children going missing from care  recommendation 1.2..\nProvide tailored support for the looked-after child or young person to prevent exploitation, by addressing issues specific to young girls and boys, trafficked children and unaccompanied asylum-seeking children (for example, addressing issues of self-esteem, domestic abuse, negative relationships and previous exploitation).\nReview the case files of looked-after children and young people who have been the subject of safeguarding meetings, to help the safeguarding partnership learn and develop future safeguarding responses (or to inform best practice).\nFor a short explanation of why the committee made these recommendations and how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on safeguarding .\nFull details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review G: barriers and facilitators for promoting physical, mental and emotional health and wellbeing of looked-after children and young people and care leavers.\n\n【18】 # Health and wellbeing\n\n【19】 ## Building expertise about trauma and raising awareness\nEnsure that all practitioners working with looked-after children and young people are aware of the impact of trauma (including developmental trauma) and attachment difficulties and appropriate responses to these, to help them build positive relationships and communicate well.\nEnsure that practitioners and carers working with unaccompanied asylum-seeking children are aware of the issues that affect this group, including health needs, safeguarding issues, language and culturally sensitive care needs, and the danger of going missing.\nEnsure that there is sufficient specialist professional expertise to support, and provide consultation for, looked-after children and young people with more complex needs. This could be provided through more intensive (responsive) trauma-informed training, or by sharing expertise across agencies.\nFor a short explanation of why the committee made these recommendations and how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on building expertise about trauma and raising awareness .\nFull details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in:\nevidence review C: interventions to support positive relationships for looked-after children, young people and care leavers\nevidence review D: barriers and facilitators for supporting positive relationships among looked-after children and young people\nevidence review E: interventions and approaches to support practitioners in completing physical and mental health and wellbeing assessments (and act on findings during the care journey) for looked-after children and young people\nevidence review G: barriers and facilitators for promoting physical, mental and emotional health and wellbeing of looked-after children and young people and care leavers.\n\n【20】 ## Physical and mental health and wellbeing assessments\nIn line with statutory guidance, when a child or young person enters care, local authorities must ensure that healthcare teams are informed as soon as possible about the legal status of the looked-after child or young person and why they have entered care (within 5 working days, as specified by the Care Planning, Placement and Case Review Regulations . Get consent to share this information from an adult with parental responsibility, or from the looked-after child or young person directly if appropriate.\nWhen a child or young person enters care, social workers should:\nMake a formal request for the initial health assessment, giving the reasons that the child or young person is coming into the care system.\nAsk for consent from the birth parents (or from another adult with parental responsibility, or from the looked-after young person directly if appropriate) to access and share information from the child health record.\nAsk for consent from the birth parents to share their own health information, and ask them to complete a parental health questionnaire to help with this. If the birth mother has agreed to share her health information, ask the relevant hospital about her health during pregnancy. All this information should be available in time for the looked-after child or young person's initial health assessment.\nEnsure that statutory review health assessments for a looked-after child or young person are carried out by the same healthcare professional each time, if possible.\nConsider the need for confidential and private access to healthcare for looked-after young people, for example if phone use or internet use are restricted because of safeguarding needs, or when seeking out sexual health advice or treatment. For guidance on one-to-one interventions to prevent sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and contraceptive services, see NICE's guidelines on STIs and contraceptive services.\nHealthcare professionals should compile a history of the looked-after child or young person's health from the information they hold in the health records and additional information given to healthcare professionals from other teams, to give practitioners and carers a clear sense of their past, present, and likely future physical and mental health needs.\nBe aware that care leavers are very likely to request access to their health and social care records. Practitioners should ensure that the language used in the records and the way events are captured are sensitive and empathetic.\nOffer a culturally appropriate, registered interpreter to communicate in person with looked-after children and young people for the initial health assessment if language is a barrier to communication. If language remains a barrier to communication, think about the need for a culturally appropriate, registered interpreter to be available in person for subsequent health and social care assessments.\nOffer unaccompanied asylum-seeking children tailored initial health assessments that address risks arising from their country of origin and journey to the UK. Inclu\ndiet and nutrition, including nutritional deficiencies such as vitamin D deficiency\ngastrointestinal symptoms\n-ral health\ntuberculosis screening and general immunisation status\nsexual health, tailored to the individual (for example, testing for sexually transmitted diseases; and being aware of signs of assault and abuse, including abuse linked to faith and culture such as female genital mutilation and breast flattening). For guidance on one-to-one interventions to prevent sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and under‑18 conceptions, see NICE's guidelines on STIs and contraceptive services\n-ther infectious diseases and bloodborne infections, for example HIV and hepatitis testing\nsensory issues not previously identified because of lack of screening, for example hearing, vision or mobility problems\nan assessment of mental health, with referral to specialist mental health teams if indicated\nsleep disturbances.\nAfter looked-after children and young people (including babies) have had their initial health assessment, consider the need for an additional specialist mental and emotional health assessment once the looked-after child or young person has begun to form a relationship with the primary carer. This could be, for example, up to a year or by the first review health assessment.\nHealthcare professionals responsible for the care of looked-after children and young people should review whether care recommendations in the health plan have been completed, particularly if the child or young person has been moved out of area, checking with the professionals concerned across agencies.\nFor guidance on the diagnosis and management of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and young people, see NICE's guideline on ADHD.\nFor guidance on the recognition, referral and diagnosis of autistic spectrum disorder, see NICE's guideline on autism spectrum disorder in under 19s: recognition, referral and diagnosis.\nFor guidance on the recognition, assessment and treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), see NICE's guideline on PTSD.\nFor a short explanation of why the committee made these recommendations and how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on physical and mental health and wellbeing assessments .\nFull details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review E: interventions and approaches to support practitioners in completing physical and mental health and wellbeing assessments (and act on findings during the care journey) for looked-after children and young people.\n\n【21】 ## Mental health and child and adolescent mental health services\nTo avoid delays in care, provide intermediate therapeutic or specialist support for the care network around looked-after children and young people who are on a waiting list for child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS), for example a specialist outreach team. This should not be used as a replacement for CAMHS.\nOffer a range of dedicated CAMHS that are tailored to the needs of looked-after children and young people – for example, making them longer term, more trauma informed and relationship based.\nOffer preventive services based on assessed need  recommendation 1.5., with timely delivery to prevent serious mental health problems that need tier 3 or 4 specialist services.\nBe aware that children moving placements must not lose their place in the waiting list for CAMHS, as there is a statutory right to not lose a place in a waiting list for a health service.\nProvide specialist, trauma-informed mental health and emotional wellbeing support for unaccompanied asylum-seeking children. Take into account cultural sensitivities (for example, the different perspectives of unaccompanied asylum-seeking children about mental health services) and that symptoms of trauma could come to the surface over the long term.\nFor a short explanation of why the committee made these recommendations and how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on mental health and child and adolescent mental health services .\nFull details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in:\nevidence review F: interventions to promote physical, mental, and emotional health and wellbeing of looked-after children, young people and care leavers\nevidence review G: barriers and facilitators for promoting physical, mental and emotional health and wellbeing of looked-after children and young people and care leavers.\n\n【22】 ## Life story work for identity and wellbeing\nStart life story work as soon as possible after the looked-after child or young person enters care, to support care placement and emotional stability, rather than as an intervention to deliver once placements are s\nSchedule regular, dedicated times for life story work to help the looked-after child or young person make sense of their journey through the care system and beyond, their significant relationships and their identity.\nEnsure that life story work is done in the setting preferred by the looked-after child or young person, and conducted by a named carer or practitioner with whom they have a continuous and close relationship. This named person may change over the period in care.\nInclude the following in life story work for looked-after children and young people:\nthe present – identity, strengths and significant relationships\nthe past – reasons for entering care and for any placement breakdowns, important memories and relationships\nthe future – building independence, careers, hopes and dreams.\nTake a flexible approach to life story work, and tailor it to the developmental age and needs of the looked-after child or young person. The content could include life mapping, pictures, art, narratives, and toys or play.\nCompile life story work in 1 place (such as a ring binder) and build on this in each session. Give the child or young person control over who this is shared with and how it is stored. Help them to choose a safe and secure storage option.\nEnsure that life story work for looked-after children and young people captures and embraces ethnicity, cultural and religious identity, as well as other personal aspects of identity, for example, sexual identity or disabilities.\nEnsure that a social worker oversees the life story work if another carer or practitioner is carrying out the work. For example, the social worker may share background information to support the carer or practitioner carrying out life story work, with the looked-after child or young person's consent.\nThink about and plan how to carry out life story work for looked-after children and young people, with sibling groups, in a manner appropriate to developmental age. This may inclu\npreparing siblings for navigating conversations with older siblings or siblings not in care\ndeciding whether it is appropriate to deliver life story work sessions in a sibling group or individually\ndetermining whether conversations will include sensitive information.\nEnsure that the experience and skillset of the practitioner or carer delivering life story work for looked-after children and young people is sufficient to deliver good quality work, particularly in complex situations.\nExplain to the looked-after child or young person's wider support network that life story work is ongoing, so that they can support it as needed. For example, if sensitive or emotional information has been discussed with the child or young person during life story work, schools may need to be informed.\nPlan regular reviews of how life story work may affect contact arrangements and the looked-after child or young person's relationship with their birth family. Use information from these reviews to adjust the support provided. This could include, for example, involving birth families in life story work to encourage consistencies in narratives explored, and helping the looked-after child or young person with reframing previous relationships.\nFor a short explanation of why the committee made these recommendations and how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on life story work for identity and wellbeing .\nFull details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review B: barriers and facilitators for supporting care placement stability among looked-after children and young people.\n\n【23】 ## Relationships and wellbeing activities\nPromote a positive relationship between the primary carer and the looked-after child or young person as the main way to support the social, emotional and mental wellbeing of the looked-after child or young person.\nWhen making safer caring plans, think about a looked-after child or young person's need for:\nPhysical touch and affection as a part of a healthy relationship with male and female primary carers. Take into account any adverse childhood experiences.\nPlay, particularly for babies and young children.\nDevelop the interests of looked-after children and young people to help them develop their identity and to find peer support and new friendships. Do this by helping them to find, and setting aside time, for outings, interest groups and other activities that will help them to build skills. These may inclu\n-ne-to-one activities accompanied by the primary carer (at least initially) to promote opportunities for listening and positive relationship building (for example, visiting outdoor green spaces such as parks)\nfunded, supported and facilitated activities (such as school clubs, for example making use of the pupil premium grant as determined in the personal education plan) specifically to address emotional health and wellbeing needs\nactivities or outings to support identity, for example community support groups, cultural or religious activities, events or festivals\nactivities to bring together children, carers and practitioners in informal settings, for example group outdoor activities.\nFor guidance on managing obesity and promoting physical activity, follow NICE's guidelines on preventing obesity, identifying, assessing and managing obesity, weight management and physical activity for children and young people.\nFor a short explanation of why the committee made these recommendations and how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on relationships and wellbeing activities .\nFull details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review G: barriers and facilitators for promoting physical, mental and emotional health and wellbeing of looked-after children and young people and care leavers.\n\n【24】 # Learning and education\n\n【25】 ## Readiness for starting or changing school\nConsider the following to support social competence and emotional stability in looked-after children:\nearly years education, including playgroups\n-ther opportunities to encourage child-led play.\nThe virtual school should plan bespoke, individual transition support for supporting readiness for school and resilience in looked-after children and young people moving between schools and settings (including those moving out of care to permanency). This includes:\nmoving from preschool to primary school\nmoving from primary to secondary school\nmoving in the middle of a school year\nreturning to school after an extended absence. Individual transition support for school moves may include structured visits to the school beforehand, school preparation for the carer, meeting the designated teacher, catch-up support and handover between designated teachers (for example, drawing from weekly diaries and life story work).\nThink about providing multidisciplinary specialist support for transition between school placements, tailored to the looked-after child or young person's needs and alongside or part of the virtual school and the team around the child – for example, including healthcare professionals in transition support for looked-after people who have health conditions that affect their education.\nFor a short explanation of why the committee made these recommendations and how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on readiness for starting or changing school .\nFull details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review H: interventions to support readiness for school in looked-after children and young people.\n\n【26】 ## Support in schools\nInform looked-after children and young people and their carers of:\ntheir rights to educational support and\nthe purpose of the pupil premium grant for education and how it is distributed by the virtual school.\nSchools should ensure that behavioural management policies reflect trauma-informed practices and cover attachment issues.\nSchools should ensure that the designated teacher is a consistent advocate for the looked-after child or young person's educational progress.\nThe designated teacher should:\ncollaborate with school staff (who the looked-after child or young person is most comforwith), primary carers and named practitioners in the personal education plan and the education health and care plan\nprovide timely assessment and ongoing monitoring of learning needs, particularly in times of transition between educational placements\nrefer for specialist support when needed (for example, educational or clinical psychology), and be aware of the impact of trauma on learning and behaviour\nbe aware of special educational needs and link up with the special educational needs coordinator\nliaise with specialist looked-after children nurse teams if a health problem has been identified that affects education\nwork to ensure that young people are able to access the most appropriate and inspirational educational opportunities, especially post‑16\nhave regular one-to-one informal conversations with the looked-after child or young person and their primary carer, at a frequency informed by the looked-after child or young person.\nFor a short explanation of why the committee made these recommendations and how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on support in schools .\nFull details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in:\nevidence review G: barriers and facilitators for promoting physical, mental and emotional health and wellbeing of looked-after children and young people and care leavers\nevidence review K: barriers to, and facilitators for, supporting learning needs of looked-after children and young people.\n\n【27】 ## Virtual schools\nEnsure that the virtual school includes all of the following:\nearly years expertise\na special educational needs coordinator\na post‑16 coordinator.\nEnsure that the virtual school covers early years provision, incorporating information from nurseries and health visitors (such as the Ages and Stages Questionnaire) and other involved health services. Complete the early years personal education plan and link it to the foundation stage profile if possible.\nEnsure that the virtual school special educational needs coordinator is trained in the special educational needs and disability legal framework so they can help looked-after children and young people access all the provision and support that the law entitles them to.\nThe post‑16 coordinator in the virtual school should help looked-after young people navigate opportunities for training and education (including further and higher education, and apprenticeships) and available funding streams to support these.\nEnsure that the expertise in the virtual school reflects the needs and profile of the school-aged population it serves. For example, the population may include unaccompanied asylum-seeking children, trafficked children, children with a history of exploitation, and looked-after children on remand or in secure settings.\nMake virtual school heads the key enabler for service collaboration and a link between named specialists in the following:\nsocial workers\nindependent reviewing officers\nschool admissions and further or higher education admissions\n-ther virtual schools if a looked-after child or young person is placed out of area\ndesignated teachers\nschool improvement services\ndesignated practitioners working with looked-after children and young people who have a health need, including mental health services or therapeutic services.\nLocal authorities should simplify and merge meetings about looked-after children and young people if possible. For example, education, health and care plan meetings for looked-after children and young people and personal education plan meetings may benefit from occurring together.\nInclude healthcare professionals in multiagency review meetings for looked-after children and young people who have additional health needs that affect their education.\nFor a short explanation of why the committee made these recommendations and how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on virtual schools .\nFull details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review K: barriers to, and facilitators for, supporting learning needs of looked-after children and young people.\n\n【28】 ## Improving educational outcomes\nTo improve educational outcomes, such as literacy and numeracy, in primary-school-aged looked-after children:\n-ffer paired reading\nconsider individual or small group tutoring (for example, by trained foster carers, trained volunteers or professional tutors).\nEnsure that interventions for improving education in secondary-school-aged looked-after young people are regularly evaluated to check they are appropriate for the user and effective as part of the personal education plan.\nAssess the language and communication needs of unaccompanied asylum-seeking children:\nOffer English language lessons to those who are not fluent in English.\nConsider intensive English lessons for those with no previous knowledge of English.\nConsider the need for virtual schools to increase specialist education support for unaccompanied asylum-seeking children – for example, by providing designated staff members, and additional English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) support.\nFor a short explanation of why the committee made these recommendations and how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on improving educational outcomes .\nFull details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in:\nevidence review I: interventions to support learning needs for school-aged looked-after children and young people\nevidence review K: barriers to, and facilitators for, supporting learning needs of looked-after children and young people.\n\n【29】 ## Data collection, sharing and publication in education\nThe responsible local authorities should collect, publish and monitor information on educational provision for their looked-after children and young people, in particular those missing education (for example, those in schools that do not have a Department for Education number, or those on permanent or fixed-term exclusions). This may include unaccompanied asylum-seeking children and those with a history, or high risk of, exploitation.\nLocal authorities should agree and share a strategy for reducing the number of looked-after children and young people missing from education.\nLocal authorities, working with the virtual school, should develop a mechanism to check the spending of the total pupil premium grant, beyond the information recorded in the personal education plan, and evaluate the impact of the spending on the looked after child or young person.\nFor a short explanation of why the committee made these recommendations and how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on data collection, sharing and publication in education .\nFull details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review K: barriers to, and facilitators for, supporting learning needs of looked-after children and young people.\n\n【30】 ## Further and higher education\nVirtual schools should collaborate with universities and colleges to support looked-after young people to access higher or further education. Ways to do this could inclu\nresidential experiences and visits to university or college campuses, mentoring by near peers in higher or further education, and coaching\nlocal opportunities such as university access schemes and college support programmes\nencouraging self-identification as a care leaver, once in university or college, to help them access support such as financial bursaries.\nEnsure that looked-after young people are aware of the possibility of re-entering education when older (up to age  with the financial support of their local authority.\nPersonal advisers, with the support of the post‑16 coordinator, should help care leavers to understand the funding and support available for re-entering education, as part of the care offer, once they have left care.\nVirtual schools should support a looked-after young person's entry into careers and training. Ways to do this could include providing:\ncareers support and advice\ncurrent local opportunities such as work experience placements, apprenticeships and internships (particularly those targeted at looked-after young people and care leavers).\nFor a short explanation of why the committee made these recommendations and how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on further and higher education .\nFull details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review J: interventions to support entry into further or higher education or training in looked-after children and young people.\n\n【31】 # Transition between care placements and to permanent placements\nThese recommendations cover support for all permanent carers, including long-term foster carers, special guardians, connected carers, adopters, key workers in residential care and reunified birth parents.\n\n【32】 ## Before transition\nWhen planning transition between care placements, social workers should aim to have a good match between the permanent carers and the looked-after child or young person:\nassess the child or young person's case history and care needs, and the carers' strengths, support and training needs (including the length of time needed for training), then\ndiscuss relationship dynamics with the looked-after child or young person and their prospective carers.\nDuring the transition period, support the foster carer and permanent carer relationship. Help to manage foster carer expectations during the planning stage (for example, the need for the permanent carer to be in the foster carer's house at times, using non-judgemental supportive language with new carers and understanding the emotional challenges for the foster carer of 'letting go').\nIn the planning stage, discuss the need for longer-term contact and longer-term contact arrangements with the current foster carer, for example contact by letter or email or meeting up once the looked-after child or young person has settled in their new placement.\nEncourage and help the permanent carer's family and support network, including other children in the home, to be involved when a looked-after child or young person moves into their new placement – for example, by offering a family and friends training day before the placement.\nConsider support, by trained staff, for birth parents with substance and alcohol misuse to support reunification. If the support is given, carry it out alongside court processes, such as family drug and alcohol courts.\nThink about providing relational, emotional and mental health support for birth parents and families, alongside court processes, to support reunification.\nContinue mental health support and support for drug and alcohol abstinence after reunification.\nConsider concurrent planning to speed up the transition to permanent placements. If concurrent planning is used, ensure that carers and birth parents are well informed about the risk of late changes to the permanency plan.\nFor guidance on support for drug and alcohol abstinence and behaviour change, follow NICE's guidance on lifestyle and wellbeing.\nFor a short explanation of why the committee made these recommendations and how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on before transition between care placements and to permanent placements .\nFull details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in:\nevidence review L: interventions to support looked-after children and young people transitioning out of care to living with adoptive or birth parents or special guardians, or into connected care\nevidence review M: barriers to, and facilitators for, supporting looked-after children and young people in transition out of care to living with their adoptive or birth parents or special guardians, or into connected care.\n\n【33】 ## During transition\nDuring transition to a new permanent or long-term placement, think about the need for a more integrated experience for looked-after children (including non-verbal children) and young people that takes into account previous significant caregiving relationships. This could be achieved, for example, by creating opportunities for current and new carers to meet, developing positive carer-to-carer relationships and sharing information (such as familiar routines, emotional responses and diet) before the placement move.\nWhen a looked-after child or young person moves between care placements or out of care to permanent placements, ensure that:\ncontact support takes into account the need for continuity with their existing social network (for example, previous friendships), especially if the care or educational placement is in a new area and\nthe transition period allows sufficient time for new social connections to form and for coming to terms with the loss of previous relationships.\nTo ensure that the permanency process is focused on the looked-after child or young person, set aside time for 'checking in' with them. Checking in should consist of careful observation and listening, writing a record of the conversation, and sharing the perspective of the looked-after child or young person to feed into shared decision making about transition arrangements.\n be present during check-ins, particularly for non-verbal children and young people, and children and young people with learning difficulties.\nDuring transition to any new placement, social workers should give prospective carers a profile of the child and their care journey as a history of the care the looked-after child or young person has received. The information can be obtained from the statutory health reports, reports from school and the social worker's assessment.\n\n【34】 Risk factors for placement instability and long-term physical and emotional health, such as:\nfamily health history\nprevious exposures to drug or substance use, domestic violence and abuse, or neglect\n-ther medical history, including antenatal health problems and antenatal exposure to alcohol or illicit drugs  recommendation 1.5.\nsignificant relationships and previous significant conflicts in these relationships (especially concerning contact)\nsignificant negative events, for example behaviour with potential for harm to others (with context and timeline of previous events)\nprevious placement moves and reasons for them.\nProtective factors to build on, from life story work:\nstrengths and hopes for the future\nsignificant positive relationships with family members, friends and adults\nhow behaviours have been successfully supported in previous settings\nfaith, communities and religion\nroutines\n'things that are enjoyed', such as games, shopping and favourite food\ninterests, activities and achievements.\nFor emergency care placements that become long-term placements, review what information the carer has been given about the child or young person, and give them more if needed.\nEnsure that there is continuity of the care practitioners who help in the handover of information for new carers, if possible.\nEnsure that there is continuity of education (through virtual schools with oversight of a virtual school head) when a looked-after child or young person is placed out of their local authority area. Ensure that the current school provides a handover of information to the new school as part of the personal education plan.\nEnsure that there is continuity of healthcare for the looked-after child or young person so that any physical and mental health and wellbeing support can continue in the new placement. This includes making sure that any ongoing referrals and existing specialist care are transferred to healthcare services in the new location, before their move to a new placement.\nWhen supporting adoptive parents or other carers, recognise that they may still be learning to parent. Use non-judgemental language and ensure that they are aware of their rights to receive support.\nFor a short explanation of why the committee made these recommendations and how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on during transition between care placements and to permanent placements .\nFull details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review M: barriers to, and facilitators for, supporting looked-after children and young people in transition out of care to living with their adoptive or birth parents or special guardians, or into connected care.\n\n【35】 ## After transition\nWhen social workers give information about a looked-after child or young person's care history to the new carer, they should:\ninvolve the looked-after child or young person, if appropriate and the child or young person is willing, drawing from continuous life story work\nthink about involving the child or young person in sharing information, after enough time has passed for a relationship of trust to form with the new carer.\nEnsure that the looked-after child or young person can keep in contact with their previous carers and friends after the placement move, if the child or young person wants to and would benefit from it.\nAgencies should seek feedback from carers and adopters and the child or young person to improve their transition services, after the adoption order is made.\nFacilitate peer support for permanent carers – for example, by setting up and moderating social media networks and fun group outings for face-to-face peer support.\nAsk experienced volunteer permanent carers to help permanent carers with strategies to manage more specialist problems – for example, when there is emotional distance in the relationship between adoptive parent and child, and with looked-after children and young people who have severe behavioural or mental health problems, or special educational needs.\nFor a short explanation of why the committee made these recommendations and how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on after transition between care placements and to permanent placements .\nFull details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review M: barriers to, and facilitators for, supporting looked-after children and young people in transition out of care to living with their adoptive or birth parents or special guardians, or into connected care.\n\n【36】 # Transition out of care to independence\n\n【37】 ## Extended care\nEncourage and support young people leaving care to stay in their current care placement until at least age 18. Explore the possibility of staying with current carers beyond age 18.\nTake into account the increased risk to young people (aged 16 to  posed by breakdowns in placement that lead to moves into inappropriate housing. Whenever possible, avoid using unregulated housing, particularly for young people at higher risk of exploitation or risk-taking behaviour. If a move to unregulated housing is planned, thoroughly document the risks and the plans to mitigate these, and review this regularly.\n\n【38】 ## Needs assessment\nPersonal advisers, working with social workers, should assess the needs of looked-after young people when transitioning out of care to independence. Take into account:\nprevious life story work\nproblem-solving skills and practical skills, including life skills such as financial literacy, budgeting and household management\nphysical and mental health support and long-term health needs, for example managing treatments and appointments\neducation, training and employment\nfinancial resources\ncommunication needs\nsocial network (assessing gaps, connectedness, isolation, and both negative and supportive relationships).\nBased on the needs assessment, consider providing the following support for care leavers:\nAccess to health services, including registering with a GP, dentist, optician, sexual health services and therapists (for those with complex healthcare needs), and extending access to CAMHS (to support continuity of care) or alternative emotional and wellbeing services such as online support, face-to-face counselling or group work. If needed, continue services beyond age 18 until care has been transferred to adult services.\nSupport for gaps in social network.\nLife skills training.\nSupport for pregnancy and parenting.\nJob preparation services, job searching and career advice.\nFlexible funding to support career development, for example for specialist equipment.\nSuiand ongoing accommodation (through the leaving care team working together with other housing services), for example supported housing.\nProvide the following services to give care leavers a safety net:\ndrop-in services\nmore frequent meetings with their personal adviser, if the care leaver wants them\nfacilitated peer support groups.\n\n【39】 ## Plans and support for care leavers\nTell care leavers and their primary carers:\nabout the rights of care leavers to statutory support (related to care-leaver status such as child in care and relevant child support) and extended support from age 18 to 25 (including reopening pathway planning and contact with the local authority)\nthat care leavers can receive the full level of support to re-enter education up to age 25.\nExplicitly outline the support available to care leavers in a care offer, and ensure that this can be accessed easily by care leavers up to age 25.\nConsider using virtual meetings to help meet the needs of care leavers who are living outside of their responsible authority.\nSchedule pathway plan reviews to occur near significant milestones if possible, for example education, training or employment application deadlines.\nExplain to care leavers and their primary carers how the pathway plan works, and the care leaver's rights associated with pathway planning – for example, that they can request an additional pathway plan review.\nTell care leavers and their primary carers of the rights of care leavers to advocacy services, to ensure that they receive the statutory provision they are entitled to and that advocacy services are provided in good time to support them with significant milestones.\nWhen developing pathway plans for care leavers, include clear timeframes for actions, and who is responsible for completing the action.\nQuality assure and review pathway plans for care leavers to ensure that improvements in outcomes are achieved.\nPersonal advisers should tell care leavers about services available in their area to support independence. These could include work experience opportunities, apprenticeships and college support.\nFor further guidance on transition from child to adult services, particularly for those with complex health needs and disabilities, follow NICE's guideline on transition from children's to adults' services for young people using health or social care services.\nFor a short explanation of why the committee made these recommendations and how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on transition out of care to independence .\nFull details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in:\nevidence review N: interventions and approaches to support looked-after young people transitioning out of care into independent living\nevidence review O: barriers to, and facilitators for, supporting and developing looked-after young people to transition out of care into independent living.\n\n【40】 ## Support for care leavers in further and higher education\nConsider the need for extended care beyond age 18 for care leavers:\nin higher and further education\nwith special educational needs and disabilities.\nVirtual school heads should take into account educational opportunities for care leavers beyond traditional further or higher education when deciding whether to extend support.\nFor care leavers who move away to college or university, ensure that there is continuity of housing during holidays, with meaningful social support. This support could include 'buddying' systems for peer support, mentoring from older student volunteers on campus, and other social opportunities for care leavers to tackle isolation during the holidays.\nFor a short explanation of why the committee made these recommendations and how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on support for care leavers in further and higher education .\nFull details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in:\nevidence review N: interventions and approaches to support looked-after young people transitioning out of care into independent living\nevidence review O: barriers to, and facilitators for, supporting and developing looked-after young people to transition out of care into independent living.\n\n【41】 ## Feedback to improve services\nEncourage children and young people in care and care leavers to give feedback about their care placement and the services they receive. This could be done, for example, through children in care councils, care leaver forums and surveys.\nWhen seeking feedback, specifically seek out the views of children and young people who are looked after out of area.\nInclude feedback in decision making to improve services.\nFor a short explanation of why the committee made these recommendations and how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on feedback to improve services .\nFull details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in:\nevidence review N: interventions and approaches to support looked-after young people transitioning out of care into independent living\nevidence review O: barriers to, and facilitators for, supporting and developing looked-after young people to transition out of care into independent living.\n\n【42】 # Forum for strategic leadership and best practice\nUse forums to help communication and bring together expertise and leadership from all agencies providing care for looked-after children and young people, as well as representatives of looked-after children and young people and their carers, and care leavers.\nUse forums for looked-after children and young people to highlight examples of exemplary practice, review recent research, align and improve tools used for health and risk assessments, educate practitioners, understand one another's roles and responsibilities (and identify important gaps in provision of services), standardise language (for example, job titles and the names of risk-assessment tools and procedures) and agree a partnership approach to practice.\nFor a short explanation of why the committee made these recommendations and how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on forum for strategic leadership and best practice .\nFull details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review E: interventions and approaches to support practitioners in completing physical and mental health and wellbeing assessments (and act on findings during the care journey) for looked-after children and young people.\n\n【43】 # Terms used in this guideline\nThis section defines terms that have been used in a particular way for this guideline. For other definitions see the NICE glossary and the Think Local Act Personal Care and Support Jargon Buster.\n\n【44】 ## Ages and Stages Questionnaire\nThe Ages and Stages Questionnaire provides developmental and social–emotional screening for children between birth and age 6. It draws on parents' knowledge and is widely used in practice to pinpoint developmental progress and catch developmental delays in young children.\n\n【45】 ## Attachment\nA deep and long-lasting emotional bond between 2 people. For example, it includes the child seeking to be close to their caregiver when they feel upset or threatened, with the caregiver responding sensitively and appropriately to their needs. Attachment disorder is a recognised mental disorder that affects a very small minority of children experiencing attachment problems. Insecure attachment patterns and disorganised attachment are more common and are indicators of possible dysfunction in a child's attachment system that can lead to poor outcomes.\n\n【46】 ## Carer\nThe primary carer of the looked-after child or young person – that is, the adult who has primary responsibility for the day-to-day care of the looked-after child or young person.\n\n【47】 ## Care network\nThe carers and professionals who support the looked-after child or young person, including, for example, foster carers, social workers, healthcare professionals and educational professionals.\n\n【48】 ## Concurrent planning\nUsually for babies and young children who are likely to need adoption but who have a chance of being reunited with their birth family. In concurrent planning, concurrent carers are approved as both foster and adoptive parents. They act as foster carers while the courts decide whether or not a child can return to their birth family. During this time, the children see their parents regularly in supervised contact centres and the concurrent carers support the birth family's efforts to regain the care for their child.\n\n【49】 ## Connected carers\nRelatives, friends or other people who have a pre-existing relationship with the looked-after child or young person. If a child or young person cannot live with their parents, connected carers can become their approved foster carers. The child formally remains a looked-after child or young person.\n\n【50】 ## Contact supervisors\nThe role of a contact supervisor is to unobtrusively observe contact between looked-after children and young people and their parents or other family members during their arranged visits, to ensure that all contact is safe and positive.\n\n【51】 ## Contextual safeguarding\nks to recognise the risks to the child or young person that occur outside the home and respond to these to keep them safe. The risks can include violence and abuse from, for example, the person's neighbourhood or school, or social media.\n\n【52】 ## Foster carers\n live in long-term foster care placements if a return home is not possible.\n\n【53】 ## Health plan\nPart of each looked-after child and young person's care plan. It is written after the initial and review health assessments. Health needs or concerns are identified and actions are formulated into the health plan to address the health concern. It is incorporated into the child's care plan. The health plan is reviewed after each subsequent health assessment and at the child's looked-after review, or as circumstances change, to ensure that health actions have been completed.\n\n【54】 ## Initial health assessment\nA statutory health assessment for looked-after children and young people that must be completed within 20 working days of coming into care. It must be completed by a doctor who is registered with the General Medical Council and holds a licence to practise.\n\n【55】 ## Life story work\nA social work intervention that aims to help children and young people in care begin to understand and accept their personal history and future. Life story books are often used to give a visual aid and reminder of important events or feelings.\n\n【56】 ## Multidimensional treatment foster care\nMultidimensional treatment foster care (now called Treatment Foster Care Oregon) is a solo foster placement with a specially trained foster family for between 9 and 12 months. It includes intensive support from a multidisciplinary team, with 24‑hour support from the programme supervisor. The intention is to change behaviour through promoting positive role models. During the placement, the young person's behaviour is closely monitored and good behaviour is rewarded. Family therapy is provided for birth parents, and they are taught the same strategies in preparation for reuniting them with their child. Also known as intensive fostering.\n\n【57】 ## Non-verbal\nNot yet able or unable to talk – for example, because they are too young or they have a disability.\n\n【58】 ## Paired reading\nIn paired reading, looked-after children read alongside a partner, such as their primary carer. This helps the child practise their spelling, comprehension and pronunciation. Attentive and responsive feedback by the carer throughout helps the child to achieve reading fluency.\n\n【59】 ## Personal adviser\nLocal authorities provide personal advisers to care leavers up until they reach the age of 25. The personal adviser ensures that a care leaver is given the correct level of support to achieve independence. They should have a practical knowledge of the issues facing care leavers as they make their transition into adulthood and the legal requirements for support.\n\n【60】 ## Personal education plan\nThis is a document describing a course of action to help a looked-after child or young person reach their full academic and life potential. All children in care must have a personal education plan as part of their care plan. It is a legal requirement for every young person in care of statutory school age to have their personal education plan reviewed at least 3 times each academic year.\n\n【61】 ## Permanency\nThe conditions that lead to a child or young person experiencing security and continuity in their relationships, particularly those of belonging to a committed family. In a permanency plan, a looked-after child or young person is assessed and prepared for long-term care that meets their needs, and takes into account their wishes and feelings. In a care and placement order, it has been agreed that a child or young person will not return home to their birth family, and parental rights and responsibilities are transferred to another carer, for example an adoptive parent.\n\n【62】 ## Practitioner\nA paid professional providing direct care for looked-after children and young people. Practitioners may include social workers, independent review officers, educational professionals, healthcare professionals and therapists.\n\n【63】 ## Prosocial\nProsocial behaviour is social behaviour that benefits other people, characterised by actions that show concern for the feelings and welfare of other people – for example, helping, cooperating and sharing.\n\n【64】 ## Randomised controlled trial\nTrials in which participants (or clusters) are randomly allocated to receive either intervention or control. If well implemented, randomisation should ensure that intervention and control groups differ only in their exposure to treatment.\n\n【65】 ## Safer caring plan\nEnables foster carers to consider potentially abusive or risky situations that may arise in the foster home and create a plan to minimise risks.\n\n【66】 ## Shared decision making\nA joint process in which a healthcare professional works together with a person to reach a decision about care. It involves choosing tests and treatments based both on evidence and on the person's individual preferences, beliefs and values. It makes sure the person understands the risks, benefits and possible consequences of different options through discussion and information sharing.\n\n【67】 ## Special guardians\nPeople or a person appointed by a Special Guardianship Order for children and young people who would benefit from a legally secure placement but cannot live with their birth parents. A birth parent cannot apply to discharge the order unless they have the permission of the court to do so, but the order does not end the legal relationship between the child and the birth parents (as in adoption).\n\n【68】 ## Staying put\nWhen a foster placement becomes a 'staying put' arrangement, the young person staying put is no longer a looked-after child but is a care leaver. They are therefore entitled to support (for example, a personal adviser) as a care leaver but will remain in the foster home. However, the former foster carer is no longer officially a foster carer for that young adult.\n\n【69】 ## Support network\nThis covers carers, professionals, friends, birth family and any other supportive adults who provide formal or informal support to the looked-after child or young person.\n\n【70】 ## Unaccompanied asylum-seeking children\nChildren and young people who have left their country of origin without the care or protection of their parents or carers and are seeking asylum in the UK.\n\n【71】 ## Virtual school\nThe virtual school champions progress and educational attainment of looked-after children and young people in the local authority. The virtual school is not 'attended' but provides coordination of educational services for looked-after children and young people at a strategic and operational level. Looked-after children and young people within the local authority remain the responsibility of the school at which they are enrolled.# Recommendations for research\nThe guideline committee has made the following recommendations for research.\n\n【72】 # Key recommendations for research\n\n【73】 ##

Why the committee made the recommendation\n understood that looked-after children and young people themselves constitute a vulnerable group and therefore certain subgroups of looked-after children and young people may be disadvantaged in multiple ways. Based on their own knowledge and experience, as well as focus group and interview-based evidence, the committee recognised that ensuring these groups are not marginalised, and that their needs are met, may need additional attention and expertise.\n\n【84】 ## How the recommendation might affect practice\nThis recommendation is not expected to need significant additional resources. It is the statutory duty of local authorities to ensure that children and young people in their care are not disadvantaged or marginalised as a result of their protected characteristics.\nReturn to recommendation\n\n【85】 # Supporting positive relationships\n\n【86】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nRecommendations 1.2.1 and 1.2.2\nThe committee discussed that supporting positive relationships is often spoken about as an aim of care, but it may be poorly defined in practice. A large amount of evidence from the UK based on interviews and focus groups (qualitative evidence) considered the factors that help to build these relationships. In many cases, the committee observed that looked-after children and young people were not asking for more specific interventions or programmes. On the contrary, they often perceived an excess of practitioners involved with their daily lives. Rather, they wanted genuine caring relationships that reflected core principles outlined in this recommendation.\nThe committee considered that a common barrier to these relationships lay in the ability of the looked-after child or young person to communicate. They were aware that the prevalence of speech and language problems is higher among children who grow up in disadvantaged homes and experience neglect, which includes many in the care system. Implementing this recommendation could result in more timely referrals to speech and language therapists, if needed.\nRecommendations 1.2.3 to 1.2.6\nThe committee looked at robust study designs (randomised controlled trials) on interventions aimed at enhancing the relationship between siblings in care. The evidence from these showed that the interventions improved the quality of sibling interaction and reduced aggressive behaviour.\n non-biological siblings they were living with (biological or adopted children of the carer). However, they noted that harm could result if safeguarding considerations were not taken into account because facilitated sibling relationships may not always be beneficial. Therefore, these interventions were not to be recommended in every case.\n teach the carer new methods for mediating sibling relationships.\nThe committee emphasised that training to promote positive sibling relationships should start at the time of placement. However, based on their own experience, the committee agreed that the relationship between siblings needs to be sbefore any activity-based interventions could be attempted. This could be achieved by support targeted at helping carers understand and maintain ssibling relationships – for example, in the home setting with a professional who is trained in mediating strategies.\nRecommendations 1.2.7 to 1.2.13\nOne of the key themes of the interviews and focus groups was the need for those in the care network to form a relationship with the child or young person and with other practitioners within the network and use shared decision making. This is to support the person's capacity to act independently to make their own choices. The committee were keen to highlight this, particularly for contact arrangements, and agreed that the child or young person's ability to choose who to have contact with should be supported. They noted the need to balance this against any safeguarding risks.\n discussed that using contact supervisors can be helpful if the birth family is receptive to support and feedback to improve the quality of contact.\nEvidence based on interviews and focus groups in the UK showed that it is important to not overwhelm looked-after children and young people with too many practitioners, and to promote continuity of relationships with practitioners. The committee agreed that retaining the same contact supervisors for a looked-after child or young person, if possible, would help to provide this continuity.\nThe committee discussed the fact that contact supervisors sometimes share intimate experiences and vulnerable moments with the looked-after child or young person and their birth family. Based on their own experience, the committee considered that if the role of the contact supervisor was more developed, there would be the potential to better support birth family relationships, give greater feedback of information to the care team and have better safeguarding. The committee therefore agreed that more training was needed for contact supervisors to improve the contact experience.\nEvidence based on interviews and focus groups showed that contact may need a high level of support at the start of placements. However, this could, in some cases, be hindered by high levels of monitoring, and decreasing levels of support may be needed as time progresses. Therefore, the committee considered that a more cautious approach to contact may be needed in the early stages of care placements, adjusting supervision intensity according to needs over time.\n stressed that non-English contact supervision needs an interpreter present to make good safeguarding and support possible.\nThe committee discussed interview- and focus group-based evidence on social-media-based contact. They recognised that such resources could help ongoing relationships much more easily than traditional methods because social media is easily accessible for young people and needs little organisation, but unobserved contact online could pose serious dangers by bypassing safeguarding measures. The committee therefore agreed that safeguarding considerations need to always take into account the possibility of online contact. For example, if social media contact was permitted in cases with moderate safeguarding considerations, it would be important for the content of interactions to be monitored and the amount of time spent communicating managed.\nLarge amounts of UK-based interview and focus group evidence considered positive relationships and contact arrangements and how these might be supported. However, no themes considered how social media influences contact arrangements or how this might be facilitated by carers and the risks be managed. The committee agreed that research is needed to determine the effectiveness of support mechanisms and interventions to manage the use of social media in care placements, particularly among those at risk of exploitation  the recommendation for research on using and safeguarding social media in contact with birth parents).\nBased on committee experience and knowledge, the committee sought to highlight the extra support that may be needed for children who are placed out of area. Geographical distance may present an obstacle to their ability to remain in contact with family and friends. Support to help overcome this could include financial support to help birth parents pay travel costs and attend contact sessions.\nRecommendations 1.2.14 to 1.2.17\n mean that any information given to the child or young person would be done in a way that they can understand and accept, particularly when a carer transition is approaching.\nBased on committee experience and knowledge, and some interview and focus group-based evidence, the committee recognised the need for more support for social workers to prevent burnout, which can lead to greater turnover in staff and loss of continuity for looked-after children and young people. The committee considered factors that could help prevent burnout at work, as well as improving the amount of time available for direct care. These included supervision with regular check-ins and a focus on reflective practice; consultation for complex and specialist problems; and trauma-informed training to promote positive relationships, as well as more practical support to increase the time available for direct one-to-one work.\nThe committee noted that when social workers are trauma informed, they can make sense and meaning of how the child or young person is behaving in relationships, in the context of their experiences. As the lead professional, they can influence how the network views the child or young person, what language is used and how it will be most helpful to support them in more helpful positive relationships. This is the ripple effect of different levels of trauma training for the network.\n needed that prioritised more time for direct care between social workers and looked-after children and young people. The committee agreed that if managers use and review systems to free up more time for direct care, this could both increase professional retention, and enable more one-to-one time between social workers and looked-after children and young people.\nUK intervention and focus group evidence on the impact of professional moves (particularly those of the allocated social worker) on looked-after children and young people supported the committee's own experience that local authorities do not have good systems for monitoring the level of social worker turnover. They agreed that if local authorities could collect and review data on turnover among their frontline staff and reflect on its impact on looked-after children and young people, this would help local authorities assess the success of staff support systems. They could then develop action plans to keep turnover as low as possible.\nThere was substantial UK-based interview and focus group evidence that looked-after children and young people reacted strongly against the changing of social workers they had built a positive relationship with. The committee discussed the complexity of addressing this issue. Turnover of social workers was frequent as a result of workload, burnout or the need to change work for career progression. Drawing on this evidence and their own experience, the committee noted that these reasons were often not well communicated to looked-after children and young people, and social workers were perceived to simply disappear. The committee agreed this could be ameliorated by informing looked-after children and young people pre-emptively and transparently about changes of social workers, taking care to recognise the emotional impact of such changes and providing an opportunity to say goodbye.\n discussed the problem of the departing social worker and primary carers not giving a consistent message about the reason for leaving. They agreed that this problem could be reduced by informing primary carers in advance about the reasons for professional transitions, particularly if strong relationships had formed.\nRecommendation 1.2.18\n noted that professional oversight of safeguarding was important to prevent inappropriate or negative relationships forming, and that a significant mentor–mentee age gap would be advisable.\nRecommendations 1.2.19 and 1.2.20\nBased on UK-based interview and focus group studies, and their own experience and knowledge, the committee considered the importance of friendship groups to looked-after children and young people. They recognised that looked-after children and young people may rely on these friendships to play a greater supportive role because of the lack of close relationships of other kinds (for example, with the birth family). As a result, the committee were concerned that contact with friends, particularly those from before coming into care, or other placements in care, should be supported if possible.\n aware of some of the barriers faced by looked-after children and young people seeking to have 'normal' relationships with peers while in the care system. Sleepovers can be a normal part of such relationships. However, looked-after children and young people can feel stigmatised and exposed if such plans are delayed or prohibited as a result of waiting for safeguarding checks on the family they wish to sleep over with.\nRecommendations 1.2.21 to 1.2.25\n suggested that looked-after children and young people felt the disparity if an out-of-hours call service was available for carers when one was not provided for them. This could lead to a sense of power imbalance and insecurity.\nThe committee agreed that out-of-hours support should be available for looked-after children and young people. However, they recognised that employing an on-call social worker may need substantial changes to contracts or add expense to already stretched social care budgets. So they agreed that other options might be used to fill this gap. In addition, identifying people at 'higher risk' for presenting out of hours could help with planning out-of-hours service provision.\nThere was strong UK-based interview and focus group evidence on the importance of shared decision making, including all agendas being laid out transparently to help the looked-after child or young person make their own decisions. For example, the committee discussed occasions when an option for a new placement was 'dressed up' as a great opportunity, when in reality, the young person was being nudged into the placement because of financial pressures, for the local authority, or because the foster carer had decided to end the current placement. The committee agreed that it was better to discuss the reasons for placement breakdown openly, giving emotional support built into ongoing life story work and using accessible and age-appropriate communication.\nThe committee noted that there was little evidence for interventions to support placement stability in residential care. They therefore made a recommendation for more research on interventions to support placement stability in residential care).\nRecommendations 1.2.26 and 1.2.27\nEvidence based on robust studies of multidimensional treatment foster care in adolescents largely covered youth offenders referred from the criminal justice system, or populations with significant pre-existing behavioural and conduct disorders. The committee were impressed by the evidence of effectiveness, particularly evidence showing reduced involvement with the criminal system and reduced rates of violent crime and imprisonment across these populations. So, they agreed that this intervention would be suifor looked-after young people with behavioural issues that are significant and persistent enough to merit regular involvement of the criminal system.\nThe committee recognised that behaviours that challenge can be a form of communication and may occur as a response to trauma. In addition, behaviours that challenge may be more common in people with learning disabilities - which are themselves more common among looked-after children and young people. The committee therefore agreed to cross-refer to existing relevant NICE guidance.\nRecommendation 1.2.28\n relevant to looked-after children and young people.\n\n【87】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\nTrauma-informed training may have a limited resource impact because it could be incorporated into existing training for social workers. The committee recognised that existing training has limited capacity for additional material, but they agreed that trauma-informed training was a priority for inclusion. There are freely available resources for trauma-informed training and, although there would be a cost associated with adapting these resources for purpose, these costs are expected to be minimal.\n need a culture change that focuses on reflective practice and increasing the amount of direct one-to-one time social workers get with looked-after people. Improving systems to increase professional retention, enable more one-to-one time between social workers and looked-after children and young people, and reduce duplication of effort, could be less costly than purchasing additional social worker time.\nCollection and review of data on staff turnover, and development of action plans to address high levels of turnover, are likely to be associated with administrative costs in collating data that is already collected. However, lower levels of staff turnover would allow for better continuity of care and minimise the negative impact of personnel changes on looked-after children and young people, the benefits of which are considered to outweigh the small costs associated with this recommendation.\nProviding consultation for complex and specialist problems is likely to need additional personnel time and resources to implement. The committee noted that expertise for this can often be found 'in-house' rather than needing to fund a new role or external training agency, but in some cases an initial investment may be needed to build up expertise within the local authority. Where consultation can be from more advanced social workers or from multiagency professionals in the network, this should not incur significant cost. Consultation provided by specialist agencies and professions may need to be bought in, for example from experts on sexually harmful behaviour.\nThere are currently limited services specifically aimed at siblings, although there is generally funding already available for shared activities and days out for siblings from local authority leisure budgets. Interventions to promote sibling relationships are potentially costly, but if they could be delivered by trained youth workers rather than graduate-level practitioners, or if existing roles could be adapted to deliver these interventions, this could help contain costs. Similarly, funding to support contact with friends could come from local authority leisure budgets, and there are several activities that are freely available, such as visits to local parks.\nMentoring interventions by peers with experience of the care process would often be carried out on a voluntary basis or through informal peer-to-peer interactions and would not need an increase in resources. Some additional costs may be incurred in providing professional oversight to mentoring programmes, which would need organisation and the processing of, for example, DBS (Disclosure and Barring Service) checks.\nContact supervisors are already a part of the care team, and any additional training needed could be incorporated into existing training, so the recommendation is expected to have a small impact on resource use. Similarly, translation services are already available in NHS settings when needed, so these should not be a substantial extra cost. A child's right of expression is mandated by statutory guidance so expenditures on translation services are justified.\nFacilitating online contact, and the additional safeguarding considerations, is not expected to have an impact on current resource use because these contacts are likely to replace other forms of contact that would need similar management.\nResources needed to support the birth family to attend contact centres for children placed outside of their local area are most likely to consist of travel expenses. Although there may be some financial implications as a result of this recommendation, facilitating contact is a statutory duty and so expenditure by local authorities is justified.\nMultidimensional treatment foster care is a resource-intensive intervention and will be associated with high implementation and running costs. But when used in adolescents with a history of persistent offending behaviour, these upfront costs are likely to be offset by the lower recurring monthly costs and additional health and social benefits from the intervention compared with usual residential care. A costing analysis comparing these costs of multidimensional treatment foster care with residential care is detailed in evidence review F: interventions to promote physical, mental, and emotional health and wellbeing of looked-after children, young people and care leavers. Additionally, improving the outcomes for adolescents who are offenders will reduce the greater impact on social care and judicial sectors.\nReturn to recommendations\n\n【88】 # Supporting and involving carers\nRecommendations 1.3.1 to 1.3.10\n\n【89】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThe committee discussed UK-based interview and focus group evidence that carers often feel their input is not valued. They agreed that carers have the most intimate knowledge of the looked-after child or young person, so their perspective and the information they provide are important alongside professional input for decision making by the broader care team.\n agreed that carers should log any help sought outside usual operational hours.\n heard from experts that peer support could help fill the gaps in support left by overburdened social care systems and social workers. Carers may offer support to each other that is more accessible and available than from practitioners, and such support only needs to be facilitated and moderated to prevent the transfer of misinformation. Creating online spaces for this could be both cheaper and more accessible than hosting in-person groups.\nThe committee discussed UK-based interview and focus group evidence showing that respite (or support) care was valued. They agreed that it was vitally important to offer carers rest, to prevent burnout and subsequent placement breakdown. They noted that some carers may feel that their caregiving duties prevent them from going on holiday or travelling.\n builds up a network of supportive adults for the child or young person and childcare options for carers. In addition, the respite (or support) care period can be more easily seen as being in the best interests of the looked-after child or young person if it is an enjoyable break for them – for example, through short breaks to stay with relatives.\n discussed the importance of the person who is providing respite (or support) care having the skills needed to support the individual needs of the looked-after child or young person.\nThe committee looked at UK-based interview and focus group evidence on resource constraints, stretched services, information gaps between carers and practitioners and reactive care (responding to problems as they arise, rather than anticipating). They found that carers were often unaware of the services available for support from their local authority and partner agencies, and therefore felt as though certain services had been kept hidden to save costs. The committee agreed that carers need to be fully informed about the support available before the placement starts. This enables carers to negotiate the support they need, and empowers them to act on a more equal footing with practitioners.\nThe committee saw UK-based interview and focus group evidence showing that carers (particularly shorter-term foster carers) are often unaware of ongoing interventions for a child placed with them, such as life story or relationship work. They agreed that informing carers about the contents and aims of interventions to support placement stability was in the best interests of the child, and would improve continuity of care with marginal costs.\nThe committee recognised that there was an additional set of recommendations for carers in the NICE guideline on supporting adult carers, and that these recommendations may be relevant for some carers of older looked-after children and young people.\n\n【90】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\n reduce funding pressures.\nHowever, the committee recognised that the availability of alternative options may vary between local authorities. To provide out-of-hours services with social workers 'on call' would need a contract change for social workers, but they agreed this could be done by reallocating existing social worker time from day work to out-of-hours work. This contract change and reallocation would have cost implications, but the committee agreed that having social worker availability for out-of-hours emergencies and urgent problems could allow for problems to be addressed more quickly. This would help to avoid more significant costs and adverse consequences (for example, placement breakdown, self-harm, hospital visits and police being called).\nFacilitating accessible peer support for carers is unlikely to have a substantial impact on resources, because most would be peer led and would not need much additional personnel time or physical resources from the local authority. Message boards may need to be moderated to prevent misinformation, but this could save time and resources by helping to resolve issues that would otherwise need the attention of care staff.\nRespite (or support) care for carers to prevent placement breakdown is already broadly available in the care system. Costs vary depending on individual needs and local funding streams. The committee recommended the approach to respite (or support) care that should be taken if respite (or support) care is needed, rather than necessarily recommending additional respite (or support) care beyond what is already provided.\nReturn to recommendations\n\n【91】 # Training for carers\nRecommendations 1.3.11 to 1.3.20\n\n【92】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nBased on their experience and knowledge, the committee recognised that, in practice, training – such as behaviour management training – is often delivered reactively, in response to difficulties that a carer is currently experiencing. This threatens placement stability because the carer may feel underprepared and under-supported to continue the placement. The committee advocated a greater emphasis on forward planning support for carers (before placement) based on the recognised and documented needs of the individual child, and involving other agencies as needed.\n included child-training components). This evidence covered a wide range of training programmes. The committee agreed that the evidence broadly supported the benefit of parent-training interventions in tackling child behaviour problems, and in improving the child–carer relationship.\nHowever, they noted that the components of these training interventions may differ. Common components in the interventions studied included teaching and information giving focused on different aspects of parenting theory such as sensitive caregiving, attachment, social interaction learning theory, being trauma informed and broader behavioural management techniques. To support teaching, some interventions used video-feedback techniques, and others used homework or home assignments, role play, coaching, practical activities and follow-up booster sessions.\nThe committee noted that training can be expensive, and it is likely that different carers would need a different intensity of training. To reduce costs, a mandatory schedule of training could be delivered as a tutorial (perhaps virtually) to all carers. The committee were aware that mandatory training, for example for foster carers, may already be extensive. However, rather than recommending additional capacity to deliver more training, the committee sought to recommend which topics were most important to include in existing training schedules for carers. In addition to these, more intensive methods could be used with carers of looked-after children and young people who have more severe emotional and behavioural problems.\nBased on their experience and knowledge, they agreed that how to provide consistent, child-focused and planned life story work to promote positive self-identity, would be an important addition to the mandatory schedule of training for all foster carers.\nThe committee were not aware of any widely available training for carers on how to be an educational advocate. In their experience, some carers are good at it naturally, but this is not consistent. For example, some may feel a responsibility for providing a home for their child but not see educational advocacy as part of their 'role'. The committee agreed such training is necessary as part of the mandatory training for carers. The importance of involving the primary carer was backed up by UK-based interview and focus group evidence suggesting that looked-after children and young people preferred carer-delivered educational support (as opposed to interventions delivered by other adults or professionals), because of fears of yet more transient practitioners developing a relationship with them and then leaving.\nThe committee discussed subgroups of carers who may need more individualised training. Using their own experience and knowledge, they considered birth parents in situations in which reunification is a possibility or when the child or young person remains in placement with the birth parent. They recognised that joining mandatory training schedules may not be ideal for birth parents who may have significant personal challenges to overcome and need additional support.\nThe committee used UK-based interview and focus group studies and their own experience and knowledge to consider other subgroups of carers who may need specialised training. They looked at evidence highlighting the challenges for carers of adapting to a looked-after child or young person's cultural, religious or dietary needs. For example, the committee recognised that certain ethnic groups may have hair and skin care needs that a carer would be expected to support. Likewise, carers of looked-after children and young people with special educational needs, long-term health conditions and disabilities may need specific training.\nUK-based interview and focus group evidence and expert testimony both suggested the importance of a knowledge of trauma in those caring for the looked-after population. Based on their experience and knowledge, the committee agreed what trauma-informed training should cover. They recognised that there are multiple levels to this training, from simple awareness of trauma-related issues (for all carers and practitioners working with looked-after children and young people) to training in trauma-responsive care, which may be needed for more specialised carers and practitioners. For effective delivery of training programmes, the committee agreed it was important for trainers themselves to have a good understanding of trauma and attachment disorders as well as the various effective therapeutic approaches.\n discussed evidence on a parent-training intervention for looked-after young people with behaviour that challenges or more severe mental health problems who are moving out of restrictive care and into the community. This showed that it could help maintain their school placement and prevent a return to that care. The committee agreed that, in temporary placements for which training and development needs had been identified and delivered for current carers, new carers in the follow-on or permanent placements would need the same training to provide consistent care. This would help continuity of behaviour management approaches and trauma- and attachment-informed, high-support and high-nurturing relational care. The committee noted that this was particularly true for connected carers, who enter the fostering system quicker than mainstream carers. Often a child or young person is placed with them while assessments are ongoing and there is little time for preparation and training.\n\n【93】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\nFamily support services already offer behavioural management support to birth families, but available training for foster carers and, particularly, other kinds of carers, is more variable.\nTraining in educational advocacy for carers would be delivered by the virtual school. This could be delivered at low cost, virtually or in person.\nTailored support and training for birth parents if reunification is a possibility should already be available through transition plans with family support teams, and should not incur additional cost.\nCultural or religious needs, or needs related to race or ethnicity may need more tailored training for carers who have no expertise in these areas. Although this may come at some additional cost to time or resources, these looked-after children and young people form a minority of the overall looked-after population. In addition, it is a statutory duty to ensure that looked-after children and young people do not receive poorer care on the basis of race or religion.\nTailored support and training for carers if there are special educational needs and disabilities can be provided through specialist healthcare teams and voluntary organisations (for example, the National Autistic Society and the Independent Provider of Special Education Advice), thereby helping to keep costs down. Trauma-informed training and therapeutic parenting training for all foster carers is part of current practice in some local authorities. The recommendations will reduce variation in practice across the country. Intensive, specialist training given in the home is likely to incur substantial costs in some areas that do not already provide it, but these could be partially offset by preventing placement breakdown. Placement breakdown is associated with significant short-term costs because of increased social care case management work and the need for additional placement arrangements, some of which will be high-cost emergency placements. In addition, placement instability can have long-term consequences, contributing to further disruption of looked-after children and young people's social and emotional relationships, sense of belonging and educational outcomes.\nMandatory training schedules already exist for carers (particularly foster carers) and it is anticipated that trauma-informed training, and other recommended training components, could be incorporated into these sessions without the need for extra training capacity in many cases. For example, the committee noted that there is often already mandatory training on de-escalation that could feasibly be altered or updated to include trauma-informed practice. There are freely available resources for trauma-informed training and other kinds of training. Although there would be a cost associated with adapting these resources for purpose, these costs are expected to be minimal.\nReturn to recommendations\n\n【94】 # Safeguarding\nRecommendations 1.4.1 to 1.4.8\n\n【95】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\n addressing additional contextual safeguarding risks. These risks are more commonly an issue among those in care.\nThe committee discussed ways in which local authorities could facilitate multiagency working and data sharing. They suggested that meetings were needed to bring together practitioners and facilitate information exchange. Based on expert testimony and their own experience, the committee agreed that representatives from education, care, healthcare for looked-after children, and external services could provide vital perspectives on safeguarding looked-after children and young people. Experts told the committee that it was very important to include the views of looked-after children (particularly those with special educational needs or disabilities) and their carers when shaping responses to exploitation and missing children. This supports shared decision making and makes responses effective, accessible and accepto looked-after children and young people and their carers.\nBased on expert testimony, the committee considered that leadership was needed to organise successful multiagency review meetings, bring practitioners on board and help define clear lines of accountability. The committee considered that leadership in multiagency working would be best provided by a specialist in contextual safeguarding, exploitation and missing children in the looked-after population. If such a practitioner was not readily available, the committee considered that local authorities could build capacity by investing in training a trauma-informed specialist with knowledge of exploitation and safeguarding issues in the looked-after population.\nBased on expert testimony, the committee discussed the kinds of data that are most readily available and useful across agencies to inform the safeguarding of looked-after children and young people, and assess the risk of exploitation in any given placement. The committee considered routinely collected indicators at the community level: area deprivation indexes, community-level health and mental health data, number of county lines operating in a single area and missing person reports per 1,000 population (which were considered particularly linked to risk of trafficking).\nThe committee, in light of their experience and expert testimony, noted that risks and 'red flags' may be different for certain subgroups, such as young girls and boys and unaccompanied asylum-seeking children, as well as the approaches needed to protect from exploitation or going missing. For example, young girls in particular may be at risk of sexual assault, domestic abuse, and attempts through social media and otherwise to coerce and undermine self-esteem.\nThe committee heard from experts about the need for practitioners and carers working with looked-after children and young people to be able to spot and communicate safeguarding risks. Based on this, the committee discussed the training needs of practitioners working with looked-after children and young people. The committee acknowledged that training is not inexpensive. However, training on the signs of exploitation or abuse, and 'red flags' for going missing, and how to 'flag' or report concerns about these could be included in the regular training schedule for all practitioners working with looked-after children and young people.\nThe committee discussed how else multiagency working and review meetings could help to re-enforce and educate about 'reachable or critical moments'. That is, moments when looked-after children and young people at risk of criminal exploitation and grooming could be spotted and interventions employed at the earliest possible moment, particularly when looked-after children and young people could be more open to change and receiving support. Experts told the committee that any intervention could constitute a critical moment, for example attending an A&E department.\nLikewise, evidence based on UK-based interview and focus group studies and expert testimony about gangs, criminal exploitation and going missing from care strongly suggested that establishing a network of strong, supportive, positive relationships is the primary mechanism to protect looked-after people from these risks.\n suggested to the committee that certain subgroups of looked-after young people may need more tailored care to address issues that increase their risk. These groups include young girls, who may have issues of low self-esteem, and be at risk of targeting on social media; children with a history of trafficking; and unaccompanied asylum-seeking children who have been subject to previous trauma or exploitation. The committee were aware that tailored support for these groups is already offered through well-established organisations such as Abianda.\nBased on their experience and knowledge, and on hearing from experts, the committee discussed that safeguarding meetings offer an opportunity to educate and inform health and social care practitioners (for example, by bringing the perspective of emergency services to social workers). The committee were keen that learning opportunities were not lost and that a review of case files could help to spot mistakes or areas in which best practice could improve.\n\n【96】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\nTailored support for groups at particular risk from exploitation groups is an important and necessary safeguarding consideration for vulnerable groups. Existing organisations that already focus on these groups can help to supply such support, so this recommendation is unlikely to have a substantial additional resource impact. As well as improving outcomes for these groups, this tailored support may help to avoid future costs associated with negative outcomes, for example legal costs and costs associated with placement breakdown if relationships have deteriorated.\nNecessary data are captured in most areas, but the information often needs to be better shared. This is unlikely to need increased resources because the data sharing mechanisms and roles for multidisciplinary teams already exist, and the emphasis of the recommendations is on bringing this work together. Using standardised language for things such as risk assessment tools, processes and personnel titles across agencies and geographical areas is not expected to be resource intensive. It can be achieved over time by greater communication between agencies and local authorities.\nTraining in risk indicators is unlikely to have a substantial resource impact because it would probably be absorbed into and prioritised in existing staff training. Likewise, training to recognise suimoments to reach out to the child could be incorporated into existing training for foster carers and social workers.\nReturn to recommendations\n\n【97】 # Building expertise about trauma and raising awareness\nRecommendations 1.5.1 to 1.5.3\n\n【98】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\n help practitioners working with looked-after children and young people to better understand them and communicate more effectively with them.\nUK-based evidence from interview and focus group studies and expert testimony highlighted specific issues faced by unaccompanied asylum-seeking children. The committee agreed that those who were working with unaccompanied asylum-seeking children needed to have additional awareness of the specific risks facing this group and issues that may arise when providing care.\nThe committee noted that when social workers or other care professionals are trauma informed, they can make sense and meaning of how the child or young person is forming and maintaining relationships, in the context of their experiences. As the lead practitioner, they can influence how the network views the child or young person, what language is used and how it will be most helpful to support them in more helpful positive relationships. This is the ripple effect of different levels of trauma training for the network.\n\n【99】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\nAdditional training on the specific needs of unaccompanied asylum-seeking children, including invited feedback from children that were once cared for in these circumstances, and specialist organisations in the voluntary sector, could be provided as part of existing in-house training. Funding should already be available through general funds that support routine training and activities (for example, team awareness days) for healthcare professionals.\nConsultation may be provided from more experienced social workers or from multiagency professionals in the network, so it should not incur cost. However, the committee were aware that such consultation work would mean less time for case work, and therefore would incur some time costs. Consultation provided by specialist agencies and professions may need to be bought in, for example experts on sexually harmful behaviour.\nReturn to recommendations\n\n【100】 # Physical and mental health and wellbeing assessments\nRecommendations 1.5.4 to 1.5.16\n\n【101】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThere is a statutory requirement for the responsible authority to notify in writing the child or young person's healthcare team (for example, the specialist looked-after children's health team), clinical commissioning group and registered medical practitioner about arrangements for the child or young person's placement. But based on their own experience and knowledge, the committee noted that this was often not sufficiently carried out in practice. That is, the notification is often delayed, or does not give both the looked-after child or young person's legal status and the reason why they have been entered into care.\n considered that the request for the initial health assessment should be detailed enough to provide the social care context for the child or young person coming into care.\nUK-based interview and focus group studies frequently emphasised that looked-after children and young people and their carers appreciate continuity of care practitioners. The committee discussed the importance of having a continuous healthcare professional who is familiar with the looked-after child or young person, and their medical and social history, to perform routine health assessments. They agreed this is important both to promote a trusting relationship between the child or young person and the medical practitioner and to improve adherence with health plans, and to help the practitioner to spot changes in the health needs of the child or young person to support better care.\nBased on their own experience and knowledge, the committee considered the needs of children and young people trying to access confidential healthcare. For example, use of the phone or internet may be restricted, particularly in residential care. The committee recognised that these measures may be in place to support safeguarding, but an unintended consequence could be difficulty or embarrassment when trying to access sexual health advice or treatment.\nThe committee highlighted that the initial health assessment is an important event for looked-after children and young people because it allows their existing needs to be identified and forms the base of an individualised care plan. The committee were therefore concerned that the initial health assessment should include an accurate and comprehensive review of the person's health history.\nEvidence from UK-based interview and focus group studies suggested the need for carers to receive more complete and better-quality information about the child or young person at the start of care, which could include a compilation and summary of health records. The committee noted that work to compile records is done inconsistently across local authorities. The committee considered that compiling good records had the potential to transform the care of looked-after children and young people by facilitating the flow of information between agencies and preventing identified needs and actions in the health plan from becoming lost.\nUsing some interview and focus group-based studies and their own expertise and knowledge, the committee considered the fact that care leavers very often request access to their health and social care records. Care leavers may do this to help make sense of their own journey through the care system. However, if the language used in the records is depersonalising or judgemental, this can result in significant emotional hurt and offence. The committee therefore agreed that health and social care practitioners should be aware of this risk.\nEvidence from UK-based interview and focus group research and from expert testimony strongly supported the need for a culturally appropriate, registered interpreter to communicate in person with looked-after children and young people for the initial health assessment. And, if language remains a barrier to communication, for the same service at subsequent health and social care assessments. However, the committee noted this was particularly important for the first health assessment, which must be thorough and capture all aspects of health needs accurately to provide appropriate support. The committee considered in-person translations to be particularly important because of the difficulty receiving interpretation services over the phone. Unaccompanied asylum-seeking children were especially in need of these services.\n frequently found to have problems with their sleep schedule as a result of travelling long distances, often with continuously disturbed sleep. So the committee agreed that tailored initial health assessments should address the additional risks to unaccompanied asylum-seeking children as a result of their country of origin and journey to the UK.\nThe committee considered mental health screening for children who were entering care. Some evidence (which had a higher risk of bias due to the study design) showed that using an in-depth assessment identified more children needing support and helped with providing early interventions than with the current initial health assessment. The committee agreed that current initial health assessments were often insufficiently detailed to pick up mental health needs and it was important for healthcare professionals to consider the need for a specialist mental and emotional health assessment after the initial health assessment. This is particularly important for babies and children because their mental health needs are often missed. Based on committee experience and knowledge, the committee noted that this second assessment is better carried out once the looked-after child or young person has begun to form a relationship with the primary carer because mental health may improve as a result of a secure attachment relationship.\n considered the problem of actions in the health plan not being followed up or completed (either within a reasonable timeframe or at all). Based on this evidence and their own experience, they agreed it was important that the completion of actions in the health plan be reviewed to ensure the agreed service has been provided. This would need multidisciplinary input because some actions may be undertaken by other agencies.\nThe committee recognised the higher prevalence of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism and post-traumatic stress disorder among looked-after children and young people. They were aware of existing NICE guidelines on the identification and diagnosis of these conditions and their subsequent management, and agreed to cross-refer to these.\n\n【102】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\nThe initial health assessment is a statutory requirement so there should not be any additional costs to the system, although auditing the health plan may need additional time from the team of health professionals involved. A detailed and well-documented plan can help with timely provision of care, thereby avoiding costs of delay and an overall negative experience for the looked-after child or young person.\nHealthcare professionals performing the initial health assessment for unaccompanied asylum-seeking children may need additional training on the specific physical and emotional needs of these children, and on risk factors associated with specific countries of origin or route of travel, and the context of the child's journey. This training, including feedback from children that were once cared for in these circumstances and testimonies from specialist organisations in the voluntary sector, could be provided as part of existing in-house training. Funding should already be available through general funds that support routine training and activities (for example, team awareness days) for healthcare professionals.\nSpecialised interpretation services incur costs, but a child's right of expression is mandated by statutory guidance so expenditures on such services are justified.\nReturn to recommendations\n\n【103】 # Mental health and child and adolescent mental health services\nRecommendations 1.5.17 to 1.5.21\n\n【104】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nUK-based evidence from interview and focus group studies frequently highlighted the frustration felt by looked-after children, young people and their carers about delays and waiting lists for mental health support. The committee considered the common problem of delayed support for child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS), and systems that they had seen in practice to help avoid the delay of therapeutic support for looked-after children and young people. For example, therapeutic social workers, systems for outreach connected to CAMHS (for example, a psychologist or another worker embedded within CAMHS), or a specialist looked-after children and young people team within CAMHS.\n from interview and focus group studies, highlighted the harm that can be done by introducing a child or young person to a new therapist, only for the therapist to change once CAMHS have taken over care. This can lead to demoralisation and disengagement from mental health interventions. Therefore, the committee agreed that intermediate therapeutic or specialist support should be provided for the care network around looked-after children and young people, rather than to looked-after people themselves. The committee were keen to stress that this intermediate support was only to address the delay, and should not be a replacement for CAMHS itself.\nFurther interview-based and focus group-based evidence and expert testimony reflected how CAMHS are often inappropriate and not designed for the needs of looked-after children and young people. Traditional techniques such as behavioural-therapy-based interventions are not always suifor looked-after children and young people, who may need interventions that are more relationship based and trauma informed.\nOne committee member stated that some CAMHS teams have specialist looked-after children's services, but this is variable across the UK. The committee agreed it was important to encourage prioritised specialist services to be incorporated into CAMHS, to prevent the need for tier 3 or 4 services further down the line.\nBased on their own experience, the committee were aware that children and young people could lose their place in the waiting list for CAMHS as a result of moving placements to a new location. This may be more likely to happen to children and young people who most need the attention of CAMHS to help maintain placement stability. Committee members were aware that continuity of CAMHS waiting lists could be maintained by virtual schools co-opting CAMHS or other dedicated services for looked-after children and young people in CAMHS.\nExpert testimony highlighted the likelihood that all unaccompanied asylum-seeking children had experienced some form of trauma, as a minimum through the separation from their own parents, and that health and social care practitioners supplying care for this vulnerable population need specialist training. The committee agreed the importance of taking into account the different perspectives of unaccompanied asylum-seeking children in a mental health service setting.\n reflected the importance of cultural sensitivity and awareness of potential traumatic symptoms in unaccompanied asylum-seeking children. For example, they may have highly stigmatising views of mental health problems, based on previous cultural ideas, and may be reluctant to admit the experience of trauma or problems with mental health.\nThe committee noted that unaccompanied asylum-seeking children were likely to need a tailored approach to mental health support, but there was insufficient evidence to recommend any specific intervention. Therefore, they made a recommendation for research on supporting mental health of unaccompanied asylum-seeking children.\n\n【105】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\nProviding dedicated CAMHS services for looked-after children and young people may have substantial resource implications if an expansion of the existing CAMHS services and capacity is needed. However, these dedicated services for looked-after children and young people are mandated by statutory guidance and the recommendations are only reinforcing the statutory provision of these services. Alternative interventions (trauma-informed and those focusing more on relationships) may not necessarily come at greater cost than traditional behavioural approaches. However, tailored approaches would have greater adherence (for example, fewer non-attendances and less disengagement), thereby resulting in greater effectiveness. The committee considered that greater engagement in mental health services at an earlier stage can reduce the risk of more serious mental health problems, avoid the substantial long-term costs and consequences incurred when these issues go unidentified, and reduce the need for the higher tier treatments later down the line (where the greatest pressure on CAMHS services was suggested to be).\nIntermediate therapeutic or specialist support for the care network around looked-after children and young people, to reduce waiting times, may need some restructuring of services and additional cost. However, in some parts of the country, existing services could fill this gap – for example, therapeutic social workers, CAMHS outreach systems (for example, a psychologist or another worker embedded within CAMHS), or a specialist looked-after children and young people team within CAMHS.\nReturn to recommendations\n\n【106】 # Life story work for identity and wellbeing\nRecommendations 1.5.22 to 1.5.33\n\n【107】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nUK-based evidence based on interview and focus group studies showed that forming positive relationships was probably the best possible intervention to prevent placement instability. Life story work has the potential for building relationships (for example, by sharing joint activities). In addition, it is a trauma-focused technique that could help with discussing and negotiating care plans (by outlining felt priorities and experiences). However, evidence showed that life story work was often neglected or poorly completed in practice, was often started late in the care process, and was given little priority or investment. This supported the committee's own experience and knowledge. The committee discussed the importance of standardising life story work and starting it at the earliest opportunity after entry into care. They agreed this could support placement and emotional stability by helping the looked-after child or young person make sense of their journey through care.\n be supported by having it conducted by a carer or practitioner that the looked-after child or young person has a close and continuous relationship with. The committee agreed it was important for this work to take place in the context of a safe and continuous relationship, because conversations would be of a personal nature.\nThe committee discussed the key components of life story work, based on their experience and knowledge. They agreed that this work consists of building a narrative that focuses first on the present identity and strengths before moving onto the past and reasons for entering care, and finally turning thoughts to planning for and building hope towards the future.\nBased on committee experience and knowledge, and some interview and focus group evidence, the committee then considered how this may be achieved. Techniques such as life mapping, use of pictures, art, written narratives, toys and play have been used successfully. The committee agreed that these discussions should be compiled in 1 place and built on during regular sessions. They thought that the approach should be flexible according to the needs and response of the looked-after child or young person and should be a shared experience, in a setting preferred by the looked-after child or young person. However, they recognised that compiling life story work in 1 physical place could come with the danger of sensitive information being read by others (for example, peers in residential care).\nThe committee took into account their own experience and knowledge in considering the role that life story work could play in cultivating a positive self-image and identity – that is, one that embraces the looked-after child or young person's ethnic, cultural or religious differences, as well as sexual identity and disabilities.\n allow the social worker to provide additional information to support the carer or practitioner carrying out the life story work.\nBased on their own experience, the committee considered life story work that involves more people than the practitioner and the looked-after child or young person. For example, sometimes it may be useful to carry out life story work with siblings as a group or pair, because they may have had very different perspectives of shared life events that need to be reconciled. The committee agreed that the need for shared life story work should be carefully planned to ensure it did not destabilise sibling relationships, for example by divulging sensitive information. In addition, particularly for complex situations such as these, it was important for the experience and skillset of the practitioner carrying out the life story work to match the complexity of the care situation. This may need the direct attention of a social worker rather than the primary carer.\nBased on their own experience and knowledge, the committee agreed that the network around looked-after children and young people was important to support ongoing life story work. The committee considered it vital that the idea and purpose of life story work and its importance was expressed to the social work team, carers, educational staff, and birth family. Broader social networks can then be engaged in the work when needed. Birth families may need to encourage consistency in narratives explored and reframing previous relationships.\n\n【108】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\nLife story work is mandated by statutory guidance for all looked-after children and young people with a plan for adoption. It is already current practice and these recommendations can be easily integrated into the process. Although the recommendations may necessitate a higher standard of life story work (for example, with more detail and more time devoted to it) in some cases, the committee agreed that these changes were necessary for the work to be effective and achieve its aims. Training to ensure a consistent approach to life story work could be incorporated into existing training. Social worker oversight for life story work conducted by another practitioner is anticipated to have minimal resource implications because the work is either already being conducted by the social worker or would simply need the social worker to be informed of the content of that work.\nReturn to recommendations\n\n【109】 # Relationships and wellbeing activities\nRecommendations 1.5.34 to 1.5.37\n\n【110】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nUK-based interview and focus group-based evidence frequently emphasised that positive relationships were the most important aspect of care to looked-after children and young people and care leavers, and that, along with placement stability, they are most linked to social, emotional and mental wellbeing. They discussed that the cornerstone of positive relationships was the relationship with the primary carer. So they agreed that, before recommending specific interventions to support social, emotional and mental wellbeing, the focus of support needs to start with a scare placement and a strong supportive relationship with the primary carer.\nInterview-based and focus group-based evidence showed that some primary carers, for example in residential care or foster care, had concerns about giving physical touch and affection to looked-after children and young people. The committee discussed that physical affection, particularly for younger looked-after children, could be a major source of emotional stability and wellbeing, and yet it may be denied in some cases because of the primary carers' desire to be protected from any form of allegation. They agreed that, in some cases, it may be necessary to proactively promote or encourage appropriate physical affection (for example, through play) and that the need for physical touch and affection as a part of a healthy relationship with the primary carer should be taken into account in safer caring plans.\nA variety of evidence reflected the importance of shared activities to help bond relationships with peers, practitioners or carers. The committee considered that peer support could be particularly important among looked-after children and young people because, given the absence of strong family ties, they may place more emotional investment in friendships and other non-conventional relationships (for example, with care practitioners). They agreed that it was important to support the interests and hobbies of looked-after children and young people by setting aside time for outings that would help them invest in these interests, as well as in their close relationships.\nThe committee considered that looked-after children and young people are more likely to be overweight and obese than standard norms and many come into care with a poor nutritional status. They recognised a gap in good quality research for interventions to help improve diet and exercise, as well as other lifestyle factors such as drug and alcohol use, among looked-after children and young people, and made a recommendation for research on promoting physical exercise, and a healthy diet and lifestyle. In the absence of good quality research to support interventions to improve diet and exercise among looked-after children and young people, the committee cross-referred to existing NICE guidance on physical activity, obesity prevention and weight management in children and young people.\n\n【111】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\nFacilitating and supporting activities such as school clubs would be unlikely to have a significant resource impact. Funding for group activities may have more substantial resource implications, so these would need to be limited to freely available or inexpensive activities. Some group activities, particularly school clubs, could be prioritised for funding through the pupil premium grant.\nReturn to recommendations\n\n【112】 # Readiness for starting or changing school\nRecommendations 1.6.1 to 1.6.3\n\n【113】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThe committee considered US-based evidence on therapeutic playgroups for children in kindergarten entering second grade aged 7 to 8. These resulted in improved parent-rated social competence and emotional stability. But this evidence was from a small trial with no long-term follow up. Because of this, and the expense of running therapeutic playgroups, the committee did not recommend them specifically. But they agreed that early years education should include opportunities to improve socialisation, such as early years education in playgroups, as well as other opportunities to encourage child-led play.\n reduced aggressive behaviours. A similar programme for secondary-school-aged children resulted in improved emotional, social and behavioural scores, and reduced substance use.\nThe committee considered the broadly positive findings for readiness for school interventions, alongside the problems with study quality and assessment of effectiveness. But they highlighted that, particularly for a child returning to school after prolonged absence, the need of a child to cope with the possibility of peers and parents of other children finding out about their 'looked-after' situation could be traumatic, and that this is particularly a risk if the child is receiving special interventions for education. Other evidence from UK-based interview and focus group studies suggested that looked-after children and young people did not necessarily want more professionals or programmes in their lives.\n agreed that transition to a new school placement may need input from professionals beyond those in education.\n\n【114】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\n currently supported by the virtual school. Additional interventions to support the transition can be prioritised through the pupil premium grant, which is part of statutory education funding provision for looked-after children and young people.\nReturn to recommendations\n\n【115】 # Support in schools\nRecommendations 1.6.4 to 1.6.7\n\n【116】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThe committee heard from experts that educational resources were available to support looked-after children and young people, but they may not be being spent in the most effective way. The committee agreed that ensuring that looked-after people and their carers know about their rights to educational support (for example, the purpose of the pupil premium grant for education, and how it is distributed), and including special educational provision under the special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) legal framework, would encourage accountability in spending.\nThe committee discussed the importance of trauma-informed practices for all practitioners working with looked-after people. Based on expert testimony, and on interview and focus group-based evidence describing the needs of looked-after people with trauma, the committee considered that standard behavioural policies in schools may not be adequate or may even be harmful for young people with a history of trauma and disorganised attachment. They agreed that it was important for schools and regulators to understand the impact of behaviour management policies on trauma.\n come from the primary carer. However, the committee agreed that, in many cases, the foster carer's role in their child's education had not been sufficiently encouraged.\nThe committee agreed that the role of the designated teacher is carried out with variable quality across the UK. Therefore, the committee felt it important to outline the key principles of practice that this role should include to improve the advocacy relationship with the looked-after child or young person in school settings. They discussed the need for the designated teacher to collaborate with those who have the best information to support and direct the looked-after child or young person's educational path. The committee used their own experience and knowledge to identify personnel as useful partners for this.\nThe committee used interview and focus group-based evidence and their own experience and knowledge to clarify the role further. They discussed evidence in which carers had identified and organised the diagnosis of educational issues themselves (such as dyslexia). They considered that it would be better for the on-site educational advocate (the designated teacher) to identify and organise such assessments, and in a more timely manner. Therefore, the committee agreed that the designated teacher should ensure ongoing monitoring of learning needs, particularly during placement transition (which can be a time of greater educational and emotional challenges).\n considered that multiagency review meetings, including those from the virtual school and the designated teacher, may need input from professionals beyond those in education. Therefore, they agreed that a designated teacher needs to be sufficiently competent to refer for specialist support if necessary.\nThe committee emphasised that 1 of the most important roles of the designated teacher (acting as educational advocate) was to 'check in' with the looked-after child or young person regularly, whether or not they have any special educational needs. Check-ins can help to develop a rapport with the looked-after child or young person and build a supportive relationship. Because interview and focus group-based evidence highlighted the importance of maintaining confidentiality about care status whenever possible, especially in school, the committee were keen that these check-ins should not add more stigmatising and formal meetings to the looked-after child or young person's schedule. Rather, the designated teacher could have regular one-to-one informal conversations with them. The committee agreed that the frequency of these conversations should be informed by the looked-after child or young person themselves, because some may favour less intense supervision.\n\n【117】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\nAdvocacy by a named teacher is not anticipated to need significant additional resources because this is already part of the statutory role of the designated teacher. The committee recognised that there are time-resource implications in performing this role to a high standard.\nReturn to recommendations\n\n【118】 # Virtual schools\nRecommendations 1.6.8 to 1.6.15\n\n【119】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThe committee noted that no consistent model of a virtual school was apparent across the country but that some common features could be identified. As part of this, there was a discussion about the constituent members within a virtual school and the external services that should be linked through the virtual school.\nThe committee discussed including early years practitioners within the virtual school. Based on expert testimony and their own experience, they noted that early years expertise was not statutory in virtual schools. Smaller numbers of looked-after children in the early years group meant they were often allocated relatively small budgets. The same was true at the other end of the educational age range: early years and over‑16 groups are not well provisioned, with most money devoted to school-aged children and young people.\nThe committee considered there was a need for early years expertise alongside the virtual school head to provide oversight of interventions to support the early years education of looked-after children, and champion educational services for children during the pivotal younger years. Based on their experience and knowledge, the committee suggested that information to support this role needed to be brought in through collaboration with nurseries and health visitors and using routinely collected data.\nExpert testimony highlighted the need for closer working between the virtual school head and the special educational needs (SEN) service. The virtual school team needs to have a breadth and depth of knowledge across social care, education and health and to understand the legislation for each area. Very few social care staff have a working knowledge of the SEN code of practice or the legislation that underpins it. As a result, the committee considered the need for someone with SEN experience in the virtual school, ideally a special educational needs coordinator or someone with SEN specialism or training.\nBased on their own expertise, the committee considered that the inclusion of a post‑16 coordinator in the virtual school could help bridge the gap in information for those in care hoping to achieve higher or further education – for example, by helping with the application processes for entrance to college, university or further training (and support while there). Therefore, help was needed to help looked-after young people aspiring to further education to navigate the available support.\nThe committee recognised that the expertise needed within the virtual school was likely to vary based on the demographics of the population being served. Therefore, they considered the need to take into account the prevalence of groups of special interest in each local authority when expertise for the virtual school is being recruited. They noted that the prevalence of some groups of special interest varied significantly between local authorities.\nAs a result of expert testimony, the committee recognised that often, virtual school heads had not been properly empowered or used, and their role had not been properly defined. In some cases, the virtual school head may be a peripheral , rather than a key leader enacting change in the local authority. Therefore, the committee agreed that, to be able to complete its statutory duties, the virtual school head should be considered the key leader and enabler for the collaboration of educational services for looked-after children and young people.\nExpert testimony outlined the range of professionals with a statutory remit to work with, and promote, the needs and wellbeing of children and young people in care and education. These professionals are asked to work together, but the expert noted that this often does not happen sufficiently in practice. In the experience of the expert, a clear bridge is needed between the services, and when this role is taken up by the virtual school, the links work much better. The committee agreed and outlined a list of services for which the virtual school head should act as a 'bridge'.\n considered the importance of including the health perspective in multiagency review meetings when health problems impacted education.\n\n【120】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\nEvery school in the UK is obliged to employ a special educational needs coordinator, so ensuring that one is part of the virtual school team would not incur additional resources. Some virtual schools may not have an existing early years practitioner, so there would be resource implications from adding another staff member to the team. However, it is possible that such expertise could be found, or developed (using training), in existing professionals in the virtual school.\nReviewing meeting structures and condensing them into fewer meetings if possible would not need additional resources because it would reduce the number of meetings being organised and held.\nThe recommendation for virtual school heads to form a bridge between named specialists in education, social, health and mental healthcare is not anticipated to have a significant resource impact because these roles already exist and would not need an additional staff member at the virtual school.\nReturn to recommendations\n\n【121】 # Improving educational outcomes\nRecommendations 1.6.16 to 1.6.19\n\n【122】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThe committee considered evidence from robustly designed studies about interventions tested mainly in primary-school-aged children. There was some evidence that tutoring by foster parents or volunteers improved maths and some literacy scores; these were outcomes that the committee considered to be important. However, the evidence base had some problems in quality and the committee noted that some carers may not want to take on the responsibility for tutoring because this can blur the line between the carer and educator roles.\nThe committee considered that flexibility was important when choosing the tutoring style that best suits the child and the placement. Evidence from studies with weaker designs (non-randomised controlled trial) showed that a paired reading intervention greatly improved reading age over the course of the intervention. Although, again, the evidence was limited, the committee were impressed by the reported size of effect.\n provide an important mentoring role.\nThe committee discussed tutoring among looked-after young people attending secondary school. They noted that a large amount of money is spent on tutoring, but there is a lack of evidence on its effectiveness for looked-after young people. The committee therefore did not recommend a specific intervention but instead agreed, based on their own experience, that interventions for improving education in secondary-school-aged looked-after children are regularly evaluated.\nUK-based evidence from interviews and focus group studies and expert testimony showed the importance that unaccompanied asylum-seeking children placed on educational attainment and learning English. The committee agreed that teaching an unaccompanied asylum-seeking child to speak English fluently was 1 of the first steps to helping them acclimatise to the country, settle with their primary carer, build positive social networks and succeed educationally. Therefore, the committee agreed that English language lessons were important for those who are not fluent, and recommended that intensive lessons be considered for those with no previous knowledge of English.\nLikewise, the committee recognised that additional support would be necessary in mainstream educational settings for those who did not speak English fluently. So they agreed that virtual schools should consider increased specialist educational provision for unaccompanied asylum-seeking children.\nThe committee noted a gap in the evidence base on the use of therapeutic interventions in current practice such as art therapy, play therapy, occupational therapy, music therapy and psychotherapy. The committee highlighted these interventions as being known to have a positive impact on educational, social and emotional outcomes in broader populations of children. They made a recommendation for research on therapeutic interventions for promoting school stability and learning to assess the effectiveness of these interventions on improved learning outcomes, school attendance and exclusion to help address this evidence gap.\n\n【123】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\nThere was no published cost-effectiveness evidence for most of the learning interventions but the resource impact for the recommended interventions is expected to be low. There may be some hidden costs such as carer or volunteer time, training, travel and administrative support.\nPaired reading is currently provided to all children in primary schools, so no additional resource is needed. Infrastructure may be needed for extra support or training for foster carers on active reading and to train volunteer paired readers. Virtual schools may be best placed to deliver training in paired reading to foster parents. The only extra costs involved should be for foster carers actually attending training, and costs may be even lower if delivered virtually.\nIndividual or small group tutoring delivered by trained foster carers or trained volunteers would have a low resource impact, but using professional tutors would have higher cost implications.\nThese interventions can be prioritised for funding through the pupil premium grant, which is part of statutory education funding provision for looked-after children and young people.\nThis trauma-informed training for teachers could be incorporated into the existing provision for behavioural management training, so is not anticipated to have a substantial resource impact.\nReturn to recommendations\n\n【124】 # Data collection, sharing and publication in education\nRecommendations 1.6.20 to 1.6.22\n\n【125】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nEvidence from expert testimony highlighted the importance of developing systems of accountability by gathering and sharing data that could help monitor and evaluate services around education for looked-after children and young people. They noted that no data was being collected on the responsibility of local authorities to secure education provision. For example, many looked-after children and young people are not placed on a school roll (defined by having a Department for Education number) by their corporate parent. In addition, there may be a culture of ignoring statutory responsibilities in this area because of lack of oversight, use of unregistered provision, and 'ghost rolls'.\nThe committee discussed evidence from expert testimony about placement of children in unregistered schools, which results in their data not being captured in national attainment s. This may create a perverse incentive for local authorities not to secure appropriate provision in order to artificially improve national attainment s. The committee agreed that local authorities should collect and publish information on the educational provision for looked-after children, with a particular focus on children missing education as well as the strategy for reducing that number.\nThe committee discussed expert testimony on the lack of accountability for how the pupil premium grant was being spent. Schools and local authorities do not routinely collect data to demonstrate that education funding for looked-after children and young people is being spent within the terms of the grant. This hampers the ability to evaluate the spending of the pupil premium grant to improve outcomes or to ensure that the funds are used directly for the benefit of looked-after children and young people. The committee noted that the Department for Education have acknowledged that they are not able to hold local authorities accounfor either spending of the pupil premium grant or provision of educational placements, because of the lack of available data. Therefore, the committee agreed that the spending of the total pupil premium grant within local authorities needs to be tracked to develop a mechanism of accountability.\n\n【126】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\n existing mechanisms for checking local authority spending, so checking educational spending for looked-after children and young people could be incorporated into existing spending checks.\nReturn to recommendations\n\n【127】 # Further and higher education\nRecommendations 1.6.23 to 1.6.26\n\n【128】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThe committee considered evidence from robustly designed studies on interventions to help looked-after young people aspire to, and be equipped for, higher education. They acknowledged that entry into further or higher education is very different for looked-after children and young people than for the wider population. For example, they have broadly lower expectations of ever attending higher education and may consider this to be something that they are not able to achieve. Interventions need to be tailored accordingly.\nParticularly, evidence from a study of individual coaching and group mentoring, with a summer visit and stay at a university campus, showed improvements in several measures of readiness for post-secondary education. Most importantly, there was a considerable improvement in post-secondary participation at 6‑month follow-up in the intervention group.\n recognised that care leavers often want to keep their care history private.\n weighed up the potential harm caused by pushing looked-after young people into higher education when this might not be the best option for them. The evidence did not report whether looked-after young people enrolled in college or higher education thrived or completed their courses. But this is a concern that applies to all young people not just those who are looked after.\n considered that looked-after young people may be more ready to re-enter education when older. They discussed that their personal advisers are well placed to outline the options to do this. However, the young people would benefit from the support of post‑16 coordinators who would have more in-depth knowledge of the funding and support available.\n important for looked-after young people considering other routes into further education and training. The committee believed careers support and advice, work experience placements, and internships to be useful and available routes into good careers for looked-after young people. Careers support and advice was strongly needed, targeted at looked-after young people because they need an extra level of support and signposting.\n\n【129】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\nThe resource impact of these recommendations to help looked-after young people enter higher or further education or training is expected to be low, although some apparently low-cost interventions funded by local authorities, such as volunteer coaching programmes, are likely to be associated with expenses for travel, management and administration. But the resource impact generally is expected to be small compared with the potential benefits of improved education, employability and independence. In addition, there is a possibility that the UK pupil premium grant may be extended to 16- and 17‑year‑olds in the near future.\nIt is not possible to make a robust judgement about the potential resource impact to local authorities of recommendations on university access schemes, residential experience and visits on university campus, mentoring by near peers in higher education, and coaching, because uptake is too uncertain to predict. Interventions such as residential experiences and campus visits would be delivered by universities and colleges themselves, although facilitated by the virtual school. Likewise, some interventions may simply involve signposting people to local programmes and schemes that are university, college or third-sector funded, so the resource impact for local authorities would be low.\nReturn to recommendations\n\n【130】 # Before transition between care placements and to permanent placements\nRecommendations 1.7.1 to 1.7.9\n\n【131】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nDrawing on UK-based evidence from interview and focus group studies indicating it was important to have a good match between carers and the looked-after children and young people, the committee recommended that careful consideration in transition planning should be given to the matching of carers and the looked-after child or young person. In assessing the strengths of the carers, committee members described how they translate the child's needs into what the parenting challenge and task looks like for the carers, and how the carers can best bolster the placement and help meet these needs.\n highlighted how the relationship between foster carer and adopter could support the move into permanency. Good communication and support can improve this relationship, for example by helping to manage expectations of the foster carer during the planning stage. These measures could help to avoid an adversarial relationship forming between carers, rather than a supportive relationship that allows for a more integrated experience for the looked-after child or young person during transition.\nThe committee disagreed with perspectives in some of the interview and focus group-based evidence that suggested it was beneficial for the looked-after child or young person to experience the short sharp shock of a foster carer stepping away completely and immediately. Rather, they supported a less traumatic approach that facilitated ongoing communication with current carers if the child or young person wanted this.\nThe committee looked at interview and focus group-based evidence on facilitating the involvement of the new permanent or long-term carer's extended family. For example, the extended family may help by providing respite (or support) care. The committee agreed that involving family and friends early in the placement was particularly important for helping them to engage with the new family relationship. But they stated that respite (or support) care in the early stages could damage the formation of attachment with the primary carer. Based on their own knowledge and expert testimony, the committee noted that family and friends training days, which are offered through adoption agencies in some local authorities, were helpful.\nFor birth families involved in substance misuse, the committee considered evidence on 2 interventions to support reunification: recovery coaching and family drug and alcohol courts. This included evidence based on robust study designs, and some weaker forms of evidence (not from randomised controlled trials). Recovery coaching was associated with greater reunification and more sand long-lasting relationships than services as usual. UK family drug and alcohol courts were associated with improvements in reunification and longevity of reunification compared with ordinary care proceedings. The committee considered that providing independent support for families at the same time as child welfare court processes could support reunification. They agreed that, if reunification had occurred, support needed to continue after reunification to help the permanent placement to last, with clear plans for follow-up. Instead of recommending recovery coaching specifically, the committee recommended substance and alcohol misuse support, by trained staff, with a cross referral to NICE lifestyle and wellbeing guidance (which includes managing substance and alcohol addiction, and behaviour change).\n recommended that mental health support continues alongside court processes. The committee made a recommendation for research about the benefit of mental health support to promote reunification.\n showed 2 particular issues with it. One was that prospective adopters and birth parents found that late changes in the care plan could be particularly distressing for them. And prospective adoptive parents found that the intensive contact arrangements could be taxing for both themselves and the child (in terms of frequency and distance travelled while establishing new routines and building relationships).\nThe committee discussed concurrent planning as something that was already practised, with success, in certain parts of the UK. However, they considered that carers and birth parents should be well informed of the inherent difficulties of such a strategy and the possibility of late changes to the care plan meaning that adoption or reunification may not occur as anticipated.\n\n【132】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\nIt is not possible to make a robust judgement about the potential resource impact of setting up concurrent planning processes to speed up transition time to permanency, or of carrying out substance and alcohol misuse support alongside court processes, because uptake is too uncertain to predict. However, these processes are already available in some parts of the UK.\nSome local authorities already offer family and friends training days through adoption agencies, and there is existing provision for this training, so it is unlikely that extending this to all areas will have large resource implications.\nReturn to recommendations\n\n【133】 # During transition between care placements and to permanent placements\nRecommendations 1.7.10 to 1.7.20\n\n【134】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nUK-based evidence from interview and focus group studies suggested the need for a more integrated experience for looked-after children and young people that takes into account the significance of previous caregiving relationships. For example, the importance of foster carers for preparing and supporting adoptive parents, focusing on the emotional state of the child or young person during the busy transition out of care, and prospective adoptive carers wanting more information about previous care experiences and health.\n beneficial for the looked-after child or young person to see positive relationships forming between their current carers and their prospective permanent carers in the period before and after transition.\n take into account whether the looked-after child or young person has other significant relationships with which they would like support to maintain. Such support could help create a more overlapping transition that gives more time for new connections to form and to process the loss of old ones.\n be needed.\nUK-based evidence from interview and focus group studies showed that good clear information before transition was extremely important to new foster carers and prospective adopters. The committee considered the types of information that should be given to a new carer during the process of transition between care placements or out of care, based on their own knowledge and expertise. It was important that this should give new carers a clear sense of the chronology of the care process for the child or young person.\n agreed the importance of briefing the new carer in person, rather than leaving the carer to make sense of the information by themselves. A social care practitioner who has had continuous oversight of the child or young person's history in care would be ideally placed to do this.\n cover behaviour with the potential for significant harm to others (for example, sexual, violent or fire-setting). However, they highlighted it was important for prospective carers to have the context to these events so they could assess them properly.\n stated that this information giving should not simply be a record of negative life events, but that the record should lend equal weight to factors that could support the success of the placement. These include the looked-after child or young person's strengths, hopes for the future, significant positive relationships (with peers and adults), interests and activities, as well as how behaviours had been successfully supported in previous settings. The committee recognised the importance of ongoing life story work to draw out these factors.\n considered the case of emergency foster placements, for which it may not be possible to deliver all information immediately. If it becomes clear these placements will be longer term, the carer may need more information to carry out their nurturing and safeguarding roles. For example, carers often need support to understand why a child or young person is behaving in a certain way in order to respond appropriately. As well as knowing about safeguarding issues, they need to know why children and young people are looked after, which family members pose a risk and why.\nThere was lot of UK-based evidence from interview and focus group studies showing that children and carers value continuity of care practitioners. The committee agreed that consistency in the practitioners who help in the handover of information for new permanent carers could reduce the sense of instability during transition, and support positive relationships.\nBased on expert testimony and their own knowledge, the committee discussed the issue of a continuing education plan when a child or young person is moved outside their local authority area. The committee considered the need for someone who has an overview of the child or young person's educational needs and can help place the child or young person in education that matches their needs. They agreed that this could be assisted by having a transition plan and 'handover' from the old to the new school placement (for example, from 1 designated teacher to another) as part of the personal education plan.\n discussed the need for continuity of healthcare as the looked-after child or young person moves to their new placement. The committee agreed that if regular mental health, physical health or dental support had been provided in the old placement, new referrals local to the new placement need to be in place before the transition, to promote continuity of care.\nExpert testimony from an adoptive parent and organisations representing adopters highlighted the importance of language during the transition period. In particular, adoptive parents (who may have no experience of parenting) may feel judged by the child's foster carers. Often, adopters feel this is a highly sensitive time when they do not want to complain or do anything to jeopardise the placement. The committee therefore highlighted the need for transition teams and foster carers to consider these issues and adjust language accordingly.\n\n【135】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\nMost recommendations are not particularly resource intensive, generally focusing on continuity of healthcare and education, parent and carer training, peer support and the detailed chronology of care process for the individual. Many recommendations focus on ensuring continuity of existing processes, or on processes that are already in place in some areas.\nHowever, extra resources may be needed for those that need more professional time to produce (such as the summarised history of care) or training and preparation for long-term carers.\nGiving opportunities for current and new carers to meet before a placement move, and facilitating ongoing communication, should not have substantial resource implications because these can be incorporated into existing transition planning. Similarly, supporting existing social networks to allow time in the transition period for the looked-after child or young person to form new social connections is not expected to be resource intensive because this can be incorporated into existing transition planning.\nReturn to recommendations\n\n【136】 # After transition between care placements and to permanent placements\nRecommendations 1.7.21 to 1.7.25\n\n【137】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThe committee considered whether it would be useful for the looked-after child or young person to give their own perspective on their journey in care to their prospective carer if the child or young person is willing, drawing from existing life story work. This could aid transparency and help the looked-after child or young person feel in control of their information. However, the committee considered that this may be better occurring once the looked-after child or young person and carer have begun to develop a stronger attachment relationship.\nUK-based evidence from interview and focus group studies and expert testimony highlighted the power imbalance perceived by adoptive parents, who may feel unable to complain about the transition process because of fears about jeopardising the placement. The committee considered that although there was little that could be done about this during the transition period (other than making permanency carers aware of their rights to receive support), agencies would benefit from seeking feedback from foster carers and adopters after the permanence order is made, and they could use this to improve the delivery of transition services.\nThere was very good UK-based interview and focus group evidence, supported by expert testimony, that peer support was useful for adopters and permanent carers. Peer support groups could often give the personalised support and availability that social care teams could not. The committee noted that effective peer support could be achieved in a variety of ways.\n the potential for specialised peer support groups to help deal with specific problems in permanency placements. Experienced permanent carers could be linked up with other permanent carers in need of support to provide tailored advice and empathy that may not be covered by the expertise of the support team.\nThe committee noted that few studies reported long-term placement durability outcomes, including post-permanency outcomes showing that the looked-after child or young person was thriving in their new long-term placement. In addition, there was insufficient evidence on the perspective of adopters and long-term permanency carers about the transition out of care and how this could be improved. The committee therefore made a recommendation for research on interventions to support stability of permanent placements to encourage more evidence in these areas.\n\n【138】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\nFacilitating accessible peer support for permanent carers (such as adopters) is unlikely to have a substantial impact on resources, because most would be peer led and not need much additional personnel time or physical resources from the local authority. Message boards may need to be moderated to prevent misinformation but, overall, peer support could save time and resources by helping to resolve issues that would otherwise need the attention of care staff, or that, if left without support, could lead to placement instability.\nReturn to recommendations\n\n【139】 # Transition out of care to independence\n\n【140】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nRecommendations 1.8.1 and 1.8.2\nThe committee considered evidence from a study, using less robust research designs (not randomised controlled trials), describing outcomes of participants who had left care at different ages. Those who were still in care placements between the ages of 17 and 23 were less likely to be involved in property crimes (men) or convicted or arrested (women). Those who had left care aged 18 or 19 had worse outcomes for time to arrest and time to first violent offence.\nOther UK-based evidence from interview and focus group studies suggested that many care leavers experienced what felt like a cliff edge moving into independence too early. Therefore, the committee recommended that, wherever possible, looked-after young people approaching independence should be encouraged and helped to stay in their current care placement until at least the age of 18.\nThe committee noted that for some, staying put in their care placements beyond age 18 could be beneficial. However, this was complicated by the fact that carers may be paid less for young people over 18. (Levels of financial support to former foster carers are agreed and specified within each local authority's staying put policy.) In addition, the ability to take on other foster placements may be compromised by allowing an adult who has left care to stay on the premises. Therefore, the committee agreed that the possibility for staying put should be explored with all carers before leaving care, even though this may not be possible in many cases.\nSupported by expert testimony, and experience in the committee, the committee considered the danger faced by those whose care placement broke down between the ages of 16 and 17. This may lead to placement in unregulated housing at a young age, when vulnerability and the risk of exploitation may be high. The committee agreed that it was very important to avoid using unregulated housing if at all possible, particularly among those at high risk of exploitation.\nRecommendations 1.8.3 to 1.8.5\nA needs assessment is already a requirement in pathway planning (beginning at age 15 and completed before age . But based on evidence from UK interview and focus group studies reflecting the unmet need of some care leavers after leaving care, the committee agreed that this process needed to be more rigorous and incorporate previous life story work to identify the person's strengths (for example, problem-solving skills and practical skills) and needs.\n some evidence of benefit for various specific aftercare services from evidence based on studies with weaker designs (not randomised controlled trials).\nThe committee therefore discussed the descriptions of the independent living services in the studies and recommended some core principles of care for supporting looked-after young people moving into independence. The committee sought to link the needs assessment for care leavers to the services provided in the transition out of care to independence.\nUK-based evidence based on interview and focus group studies highlighted how care leavers are often lost in the gap between child and adult health services and that they often face a great amount of loneliness and mental strain. This matched the committee's own knowledge and experience. So they agreed that the care leaver's existing mental health, health and dental care needed to be supported by ensuring registration with GP services and access to dental services. In addition, the committee suggested ways of plugging the gap between adult and child services until the transfer to adult services can be completed – for example, by extending access to CAMHS or providing alternative emotional and wellbeing services such as online support, face-to-face counselling or group work.\nThe committee noted that independent living services described in the evidence reviewed covered several interventions that had components supporting mental health. However, few reported mental health or general health-specific outcomes. Recognising the higher than usual rates of mental illness and health problems among care leavers, the committee recommended that more research was needed on interventions to promote the health and mental health of care leavers  the recommendation for research on continuing support for the physical and mental health needs of care leavers).\n a common component of independent living services described in the rest of the reviewed evidence.\nEvidence showed the usefulness of and need for various common components of independent living services. For example, ongoing accommodation support is a common component of independent living services and is valued by care leavers. The committee agreed that it was important and emphasised that organising this through the leaving care team working together with other housing services would promote continuity of oversight during the transition out of care.\nThe committee discussed interview and focus group evidence about the experience of the short sharp shock of independence, and that care leavers were not 'allowed' to make mistakes. For example, care leavers may initially reject support but then regret it. The committee therefore agreed that services that help to provide safety netting should be available for all care leavers to help prevent deterioration in housing stability, connectedness and economic independence. Based on their experience and knowledge, they suggested that the following services could be provided for care leavers without substantial cost to local authorities: drop-in services (for local guidance and signposting), possibility of more frequent meetings with their personal adviser (for individualised guidance and support) and facilitated care leavers peer support groups (to support relationships after care, mentoring, and share ideas and resources).\nRecommendations 1.8.6 to 1.8.15\nBased on their knowledge and experience, the committee considered that many of the problems young people encounter when transitioning out of care stem from a lack of accountability of local authorities in following and communicating statutory guidance. Care leavers may be unaware of the importance of the pathway plan for agreeing the support they will be given after transition.\nSome examples the committee discussed included informing care leavers that if something is in their pathway plan and is signed, it constitutes an agreement that the local authority will provide that service, and that care leavers do not have to sign their pathway plan until they are happy with it and may request a review. The committee agreed the need for practitioners to communicate this.\n agreed that other aspects that need to be communicated included rights to extended support beyond age 18 (for example, support to re-enter education), and rights to advocacy services to improve adherence to statutory requirements, and to take full advantage of rights under statutory law.\nThe committee considered the need for all of this information about support available to care leavers in their local authorities to be made explicit and easily accessible as outlined in statutory guidelines. They noted that, in practice, care leavers often did not know how to find their care offer and some websites outlining the care offer were not kept up to date.\nBased on their own experience and knowledge, the committee considered that virtual meetings could help bridge the gap between care leavers and their personal advisers to help them continue to access support when they had moved out of area.\nBased on their own experience, the committee recognised the need for pathway plans to anticipate significant milestones (such as reaching the end of qualifications or training) to help support next steps into greater independence.\n discussed the need for quality assessments to check that the actions were actually completed in the agreed timeframe.\nFrom the committee's experience, the support available to care leavers is likely to differ considerably by area. So they agreed that efforts to raise care leavers' awareness of local opportunities for support in independent living were needed.\n\n【141】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\nSupporting young people staying in their current placement until at least age 18 is not expected to have significant resource implications. If a foster carer is happy to continue the placement beyond 18, the cost of this (for example, the potential loss of the foster carer to the system) is offset by the benefits of improved outcomes for those who have support for longer beyond their in‑care placement.\nThe committee acknowledged that avoiding the use of unregulated housing for looked-after young people under 18 would have potential resource implications. However, these resource impacts can be justified on equity grounds, because any reasonable person would not consider the use of unregulated housing to be appropriate for anyone under 18. Therefore, it would be unfair and a social injustice to have looked-after young people endure such living conditions simply because of their looked-after status.\nThese recommendations should not have substantial additional resource implications because most of them cover care processes that are statutory across the UK, although they are completed with variable quality. For example, many of the possible interventions for preparing care leavers for independent living are currently available across the UK, but with variable access.\nSome of the recommended interventions to support care leavers may have resource implications, such as supported housing and increased mental health support to plug the gap between child and adult services. However, the provision of these is already a statutory requirement if based on a good individual needs assessment.\n be necessary to help prevent misinformation spreading. However, this intervention could save time and resources by helping to resolve issues that would otherwise need the attention of transition teams.\nReturn to recommendations\n\n【142】 # Support for care leavers in further and higher education\nRecommendations 1.8.16 to 1.8.18\n\n【143】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\n considered the high prevalence of those with special educational needs or disabilities among care leavers. Because this group may not progress as quickly in education, the committee agreed that they, especially, may need extended educational support.\n discussed the issue of university students living away from home and agreed that continuity of housing during holidays was needed for care leavers in college or university to prevent housing instability between terms. This was supported by evidence showing that housing was often cited as the reason for care leavers dropping out of courses in higher and further education.\nBased on their experience and knowledge, and evidence showing that isolation may remain a problem even with appropriate housing, the committee agreed that a good level of social support was needed from social care and university teams. Based on evidence showing the benefit of peer support and mentoring interventions, the committee agreed that facilitating a 'buddying system' for peer support, mentoring from older students on campus to tackle isolation during the holidays or providing other social opportunities for care leavers could be beneficial.\n\n【144】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\nHousing support during university holidays may not cost a substantial amount because many universities already offer the option for care leavers to stay on in their halls of residence in holiday times.\nReturn to recommendations\n\n【145】 # Feedback to improve services\nRecommendations 1.8.19 to 1.8.21\n\n【146】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nDrawing on UK-based evidence from interview and focus group studies suggesting that shared decision making should be a cornerstone of care provided for looked-after children and young people, the committee discussed the need for a mechanism to incorporate the feedback of looked-after children, young people and care leavers moving into independence back into the services provided. Interview and focus group evidence suggested that children in care councils specifically may facilitate such feedback, although something more focused on care leavers, such as care leavers forums or surveys, was needed to improve services during the transition into independence.\nThe committee recognised particularly that those who were looked after out of area may be most vulnerable to receiving inadequate statutory support. Therefore, they considered it important that the views of these looked-after children, young people and care leavers were captured and used to improve services.\n\n【147】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\nThese recommendations are not expected to have substantial resource costs, because care leavers may be encouraged to give feedback in numerous ways. Care leaver councils may have more running costs in terms of facilitation and organisation, but the extent to which local authorities will use these councils is uncertain.\nReturn to recommendations\n\n【148】 # Forum for strategic leadership and best practice\nRecommendations 1.9.1 and 1.9.2\n\n【149】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nBased on evidence from interview, focus group studies, studies with more robust study designs and committee experience and knowledge, the committee considered the benefit of facilitated multiagency working to help systems adapt to local challenges. They were particularly interested in the use of regular broad-system meetings, or forums, for care providers to exchange information and to provide the opportunity to adapt care systems to meet the needs of looked-after children and young people.\n agreed that these meetings would help standardise the different agencies' use of language, risk-assessment tools, and job titles and roles. The committee agreed that such forums could adapt to situations specific to the local authority – for example, increasing numbers of unaccompanied asylum-seeking children or increasing risks of going missing in care. The committee agreed that risk-assessment tools were useful to determine increased risk of exploitation at the individual level (for example, someone placed out of area is at increased risk), but it needed to be standardised across local authorities and agencies.\n\n【150】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\n help to bring costs down.\nThe committee noted that, in many cases, various boards, groups and councils already exist within local authorities. Partnerships with these could be organised to bring leaders together from several sectors.

Rituximab is licensed for the first-line treatment of people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia in combination with chemotherapy. Rituximab is administered intravenously, once every 4 weeks for a total of six cycles; a complete course of treatment with rituximab lasts 24 weeks. Dosing is calculated according to body surface area, with an initial dose of 375 mg/m² followed by 500 mg/m² for all subsequent doses. Six cycles of rituximab equate to a total dose of 2875 mg/m². The summary of product characteristics states that rituximab should be administered under the close supervision of an experienced physician, and in an environment where full resuscitation facilities are immediately available.\nThe most frequently observed adverse events in people receiving rituximab are infusion-related reactions, including cytokine release syndrome. The majority of these reactions occur during the first infusion. Serious but rare adverse events associated with rituximab include neutropenia and leucopenia (including febrile neutropenia), infections (predominantly bacterial and viral) and cardiovascular events (hypotension, hypertension, arrhythmias and angina). Very rare serious adverse events include hepatitis B reactivation and progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy. For full details of side effects and contraindications, see the summary of product characteristics.\nRituximab is available in 100 mg (10 ml) and 500 mg (50 ml) vials. The cost of a 100 mg vial is £174.63, and of a 500 mg vial is £873.15 (excluding VAT; 'British national formulary'  edition . For a person with a body surface area of 1.93 m², the cost of rituximab for the first dose is £1397 and for subsequent doses £1746 including wastage of excess rituximab. The total cost of rituximab is £10,128 per course. Costs may vary in different settings because of negotiated procurement discounts.# The manufacturer's submission\nThe Appraisal Committee (appendix A) considered evidence submitted by the manufacturer of rituximab for the first-line treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and a review of this submission by the Evidence Review Group (ERG; appendix B).\nThe manufacturer's submission compared rituximab in combination with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide combination therapy. This comparison was based on the CLL-8 trial, a phase III randomised controlled trial. The CLL-8 trial was a multicentre, open-label, parallel-group study in people with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. In the CLL-8 trial a total of 817 people were randomised to receive either fludarabine and cyclophosphamide or rituximab in combination with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide; data were reported on 810 people. The median age of trial participants was 61 years and 74% of participants were men. Participants had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1, and 95% of participants had Binet stage B or C disease. People with Binet stage A disease (n =  were enrolled into the trial until a protocol amendment stopped further enrolment.\nTrial participants were randomised to six cycles of treatment, with an interim staging after three cycles. People with progressive or sdisease at interim staging were offered alternative treatments by their clinicians outside the trial. People in the control group whose disease did not respond to treatment did not cross over to the treatment group, but could be offered rituximab-containing regimens. People whose disease showed a partial or complete response at the interim staging received all six cycles of treatment. Each cycle of 28 days consisted of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide chemotherapy (fludarabine  and cyclophosphamide  on days 1, 2 and  with or without rituximab (375 mg/m² on day 0 of cycle 1, 500 mg/m² on day 1 of cycles 2-. All trial treatments were administered intravenously.\nThe primary outcome of the trial was progression-free survival, defined as the time between randomisation and the date of the first documented disease progression, relapse or death by any cause. Secondary outcomes were event-free survival, overall survival, disease-free survival, duration of response, time to new chronic lymphocytic leukaemia treatment and response rates. Quality-of-life data were collected in the trial using the Spitzer Quality of Life Index and the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer-Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC-QLQC.\n enrolled 46 people (8%) with p53 deletion, a chromosome abnormality associated with a poorer prognosis.\n reported an overall response rate of 86.1% in the rituximab in combination with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide group and 72.7% in the fludarabine and cyclophosphamide group. At this point median overall survival had not been reached and the trial reported a hazard ratio of 0.64 (95% CI 0.41 to 1.00, p = 0..\n submitted analyses of data from the CLL-8 trial collected from three follow-up points of a longer duration. After a median duration of follow-up of 25.4 months, the reported median progression-free survival was 42.8 months in the rituximab in combination with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide group and 32.5 months in the fludarabine and cyclophosphamide group, with a hazard ratio of 0.60 (95% CI 0.48 to 0.76, p < 0.. At the end of this follow-up period the statistically significant difference in overall survival was not maintained (hazard ratio 0.72, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.09, p = 0.. However, the data remained highly censored, because the majority of people were still alive. A further analysis after a median follow-up of 25.5 months reported a rate of progression-free survival of 76.6% in the rituximab in combination with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide group and 62.3% in the fludarabine and cyclophosphamide group (p < 0.. At this follow-up point, the CLL-8 trial reported an overall response rate of 95% in the rituximab in combination with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide group and 88% in the fludarabine and cyclophosphamide group (p = 0.. The overall survival rate was 91% in the rituximab in combination with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide group and 88% in the fludarabine and cyclophosphamide group (p = 0.. In a further analysis after a median follow-up of 26.4 months the reported mean progression-free survival was 37.1 months in the rituximab in combination with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide group and 30.8 months in the fludarabine and cyclophosphamide group (p < 0.. The hazard ratio for progression-free survival was 0.6 (95% CI 0.47 to 0.75, p < 0.. Mean overall survival was 47.7 months in the rituximab in combination with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide group and 48.2 months in the fludarabine and cyclophosphamide group (p = 0..\nThe manufacturer presented a number of subgroup analyses. For the people with the p53 mutation the hazard ratio for progression-free survival was 0.6 (95% CI 0.31 to 1.. The hazard ratio for progression-free survival for people with Binet stage A disease was 0.13 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.61, p = 0., Binet stage B disease was 0.46 (95% CI 0.32 to 0.63, p < 0. and Binet stage C disease was 0.88 (95% CI 0.58 to 1.33, p = 0.. The CLL-8 trial was not powered to detect differences in treatment effect for any of these subgroups.\nIn the CLL-8 trial, 77% of people in the rituximab in combination with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide group experienced a grade 3 or 4 adverse event compared with 62% in the fludarabine and cyclophosphamide group. In the rituximab in combination with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide group 46% of people experienced a serious adverse event; this was 41% of people in the fludarabine and cyclophosphamide group. The main adverse events were haematological toxicities, with neutropenia, leucopenia, febrile neutropenia and pancytopenia having a higher incidence (at least 2% difference) in the rituximab in combination with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide group, and thrombocytopenia, anaemia and pyrexia having a higher incidence (at least 2% difference) in the fludarabine and cyclophosphamide group. There were no differences in the rate of other adverse events between the trial groups.\nThe manufacturer provided data from four uncontrolled phase II trials on the efficacy and tolerability of combining rituximab with different chemotherapy regimens. The combination chemotherapies included fludarabine, pentostatin, cyclophosphamide and mitoxantrone for the first-line treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. One of the studies (n =  compared a group of people treated with rituximab in combination with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide with a group of people who had been treated with fludarabine-based regimens in the past and provided data with a median follow-up of 6 years. For the group receiving rituximab the rate of overall survival after 6 years was 77% with a 95% overall response rate. Median time to progression was 80 months. In comparison with the historical control group, rituximab in combination with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide was associated with statistically significant overall survival and was the strongest independent predictor of survival (hazard ratio 0.48, p < 0..\n\n【3】 The manufacturer's submission presented an economic analysis comparing rituximab in combination with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, and rituximab in combination with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide with chlorambucil. The manufacturer developed a three-state Markov model with a cycle length of 1 month and a 15-year time horizon (to represent a lifetime horizon). The health states in the model were 'progression-free survival', 'progressed', or 'death'. People entered the model in the progression-free survival health state. The probability of transition from the progression-free survival to the progressed health state was taken from the groups in CLL-8. For the transition from the progression-free survival to the death health state, trial data were used and supplemented with Office of National Statistics data to inform the background mortality rate. Transition from the progressed to the progression-free survival health state was not possible. For the transition from the progressed to the death health state, data for people from both groups of the trial were aggregated and a single probability from the trial applied as there was a non-significant difference in survival following progression between the groups in the trial.\nIn the model the drug costs were calculated assuming a body surface area of 1.93 m², which reflects the average body surface area of the people in the CLL-8 trial. The CLL-8 trial used fludarabine and cyclophosphamide administered intravenously, but it is more common to use oral chemotherapy in the UK. In the model it was assumed that the efficacy of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide is the same regardless of the route of administration if the dosage is adjusted to ensure equivalent bioavailability. The costs of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide treatment in the model were adjusted to allow for the difference in the route of administration. The drug costs for rituximab were £1397 for the first cycle of treatment and £1746 for subsequent cycles. For six cycles of treatment the total drug cost of rituximab was £10,128. The total drug costs of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and chlorambucil were calculated as £2790, £22 and £286, respectively. In the base case, all people received six cycles of therapy unless disease progression occurred before the end of the six cycles.\n added for the pharmacist's time to prepare the infusion.\nThe utility values used in the manufacturer's submission were taken from a Health Technology Assessment report  that assessed the cost effectiveness of fludarabine as a first-line treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. A utility of 0.8 was attached to the progression-free survival health state and 0.6 to the progressed health state. The estimates of utility were not preference based, and were estimated by the authors of the Health Technology Assessment report from condition-specific health-related quality-of-life data. No disutility for adverse events was included in the model. The manufacturer provided an interim analysis of 11 people from an observational study of utility in people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. The value for progression-free survival was consistent with that used in the manufacturer's submission. No conclusions could be drawn about the utility value appropriate for the progressed health state, as data for only two people were available.\n provided an estimate of the incremental cost effectiveness of rituximab in combination with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide in comparison with chlorambucil. The incremental QALY gain was 1.91 at an incremental cost of £12,250, giving an ICER of £6422 per QALY gained. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis suggested that the probability of rituximab in combination with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide being cost effective in comparison with chlorambucil was 100% at both £20,000 and £30,000 per QALY gained.\nA sensitivity analysis was presented in the manufacturer's submission using different parametric models for the progression-free survival extrapolation. Additional sensitivity analyses were completed as follows:\nincluding costs for adverse events\nincluding costs for febrile neutropenia episodes (as in CLL-\nincreasing and decreasing supportive care costs for the health states by 50%\nassuming utility values for the health states such that the difference in the values between the health states was 0.4 and 0.1. The assumption of a similar rate of adverse events for chlorambucil and fludarabine and cyclophosphamide was tested by assuming no bone-marrow transplants, fewer transfusions and less febrile neutropenia for the chlorambucil arm. One-way sensitivity analyses suggested that the results were not sensitive to a variety of parameter assumptions including utility values, monthly supportive care costs and drug administration costs. The results were sensitive to the function used to extrapolate progression-free survival (exponential, Gompertz), and the highest ICER reported (using a Gompertz function) was £22,661 per QALY gained.\n included a scenario analysis to explore the impact on the ICER of using intravenous administration of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide chemotherapy instead of oral administration. This analysis demonstrated that the ICER was not sensitive to assumptions about the mechanism of administration. A further scenario analysis modelled the cost effectiveness of rituximab in combination with chemotherapy agents other than fludarabine and cyclophosphamide. The results of this analysis suggested that the QALY gain from combining rituximab with chemotherapy would need to decrease to about 40% of that in the base case, all else remaining the same, for the ICER for rituximab to increase to over £30,000 per QALY gained.\nAt the request of the ERG, the manufacturer performed a further one-way sensitivity analysis to explore the impact on the ICER of using alternative assumptions about different mortality rates between the progression-free survival and progressed health states. The manufacturer increased the mortality rate in the rituximab in combination with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide group by 315% so that the life years gained in both treatment groups were the same (0.24 QALYs). In this scenario the incremental QALY gain was 0.24 at an incremental cost of £7226, giving an ICER of £30,336 per QALY gained.\nThe ERG considered that all the relevant studies had been identified. The ERG noted that the manufacturer's submission was based on only one completed clinical trial, and that this was unpublished. However, it considered this study to be of good quality. In addition, it noted that this study used intravenous administration of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide rather than oral administration which is normally used in UK clinical practice. The ERG considered the study population was appropriate. It noted that the subgroup of people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and the p53 deletion was only considered in relation to progression-free survival and not assessed in the cost–utility model. The ERG considered that the main comparators used in the cost-effectiveness analysis (fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, and chlorambucil) were appropriate. It noted that the mixed treatment comparison provided estimates of clinical effectiveness comparing rituximab in combination with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide with additional comparators, including alemtuzumab, fludarabine monotherapy and bendamustine. The ERG considered that the mixed treatment comparison completed by the manufacturer was appropriate.\nThe ERG considered the fact that in the manufacturer's economic model people in the progressed health state could not move back into the progression-free survival health state was unrealistic due to the natural history of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. People with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia may receive further treatment at progression, which may then result in further periods of progression-free survival. The relapsing nature of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia means that subsequent relapses are less likely to respond to further treatment. This implies that subsequent relapses are likely to be associated with higher disease-related mortality. Therefore, the ERG considered that the manufacturer's assumption of a constant hazard of death after progression may not be appropriate. The ERG highlighted that the overall effect of the aggregated progressed health state and constant hazard of death from this health state was to imply a correlation between progression-free survival and overall survival which it did not consider had been empirically demonstrated in the manufacturer's submission. The ERG further considered that the sensitivity analyses presented by the manufacturer did not fully investigate the uncertainty associated with the extent to which gains in progression-free survival led to gains in overall survival.\nThe ERG performed an exploratory analysis of the comparison of rituximab in combination with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide. First, it conducted a component analysis to examine the relative contributions to utility gain from the gain in progression-free survival and the gain in overall survival. This analysis showed that progression-free survival contributed to 0.24 QALYs and overall survival to 0.64 QALYs (of a total gain of 0.88 QALYs). The ERG concluded that this demonstrated that in the model the majority of the benefit is derived from overall survival, making it sensitive to changes in assumptions about overall survival benefits from rituximab. The ERG noted that within the model, because a single transition probability is attached to all people in the progressed health state, the benefit in overall survival is derived almost entirely from the different rate of transfer from the progression-free health state to the progressed health state.\nThe ERG repeated the analysis completed by the manufacturer  section 3. that removed the differences in overall survival between the two groups in the model. This was done by decreasing the probability of death in the progressed health state for the fludarabine and cyclophosphamide group. A decrease in the probability of death in the fludarabine and cyclophosphamide group to 57% of the base-case level removed the difference in overall survival between the groups and resulted in a QALY gain of 0.24 at an incremental cost of £7228 and an ICER of £30,304 per QALY gained. When assuming no difference in overall survival between the two treatment groups in the analysis, the results suggested that the probability of rituximab in combination with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide being cost effective compared with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide at £20,000 per QALY gained was 29% and at £30,000 per QALY gained was 49%. The ERG identified that if it is assumed that there is no difference in overall survival between the rituximab in combination with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide and fludarabine and cyclophosphamide groups, the model outputs become sensitive to the assumed utility differences between the progression-free and the progressed health states. If the difference in utility between the health states is reduced by 0.1 (that is from 0.2 to 0., the ICER increases to £60,302 per QALY gained.\nThe ERG completed another exploratory analysis that assumed that the actual overall survival benefit from treatment with rituximab was somewhere between the manufacturer's base case and the assumption of no overall survival benefit. The ERG incorporated this assumption into the probabilistic sensitivity analysis by adding an additional variable, in which the decrease in probability of death in the fludarabine and cyclophosphamide group was sampled as a uniform distribution between 1 and 0.574. The results suggested that rituximab in combination with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide had a 72% probability of being cost effective compared with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide at £20,000 per QALY gained and 88% probability of being cost effective at £30,000 per QALY gained.\nIn response to consultation on the appraisal consultation document, the manufacturer submitted additional evidence in support of the combination of rituximab with chlorambucil compared with chlorambucil alone. The manufacturer presented data from four randomised controlled trials in follicular lymphoma, another low-grade B-cell cancer with a relapsing and remitting course. In these studies the addition of rituximab to a range of chemotherapy regimens showed a benefit in progression-free survival and response rates. A further phase II trial of rituximab in combination with chlorambucil in 29 people with a range of low-grade lymphoproliferative disorders showed an overall response rate of 89%, with a complete response rate of 63%.\n provided additional economic analysis comparing rituximab in combination with chlorambucil with chlorambucil alone. This used the same model as the original submission, with a number of amendments. The age of the cohort was increased to 70 years to reflect the fact that people treated with chlorambucil in routine clinical practice are generally older than those treated with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide. The baseline risk for the chlorambucil group was taken from the mixed treatment comparison included in the original submission. It was assumed that the hazard ratio for the addition of rituximab to fludarabine and cyclophosphamide observed in the CLL-8 trial (0. could be applied to this baseline risk to estimate the effect of adding rituximab to chlorambucil. Drug and administrative costs for rituximab and chlorambucil were included and all other model inputs and assumptions remained the same. Assuming the same hazard ratio meant the relative effect of adding rituximab to chlorambucil was the same as adding rituximab to fludarabine and cyclophosphamide. However, the absolute treatment effect would be smaller because single agent chlorambucil is less effective than fludarabine and cyclophosphamide. The analysis suggested the incremental QALY gain was 0.51 at an incremental cost of £11,570, giving an ICER of £22,490 per QALY gained. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis using the 95% CIs around the assumed hazard ratios showed an 18.6% probability of the ICER being below £20,000 per QALY gained and a 99.7% probability of the ICER being below £30,000 per QALY gained.\n noted that a single arm phase II trial is underway of rituximab in combination with chlorambucil in people with untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia who are not fit for fludarabine-based treatment. The primary objective of the study is a safety analysis of the combination of rituximab and chlorambucil. Secondary objectives inclu\nFull details of all the evidence are in the manufacturer's submission and the ERG report.# Consideration of the evidence\n took into account the effective use of NHS resources.\n\n【4】 # Clinical effectiveness\nThe Appraisal Committee discussed current standard clinical management of people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. The Committee heard from clinical specialists that approximately 90% of people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia are asymptomatic and that diagnosis may be made as a chance finding on routine blood testing. People who are asymptomatic may not need immediate treatment, although some will need treatment later in life. The Committee heard that fludarabine in combination with cyclophosphamide is frequently used for people who need immediate treatment. However, chlorambucil alone is normally used for people with poor performance status or comorbidities, especially impaired renal function. The Committee heard from patient experts that people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia who need treatment will often have a series of treatments following first-line treatment, with further lines of treatment used after each relapse. The Committee specifically considered the clinical management of people whose chronic lymphocytic leukaemia has the p53 mutation. The Committee heard from clinical specialists that these people have a poorer prognosis and are usually treated with alternative treatments (for example, alemtuzumab) rather than chemotherapy.\n shown survival benefits for people treated with rituximab-containing regimens, although results may have been influenced by changing clinical management, such as earlier identification of people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. On balance, the Committee was persuaded that the benefits observed in progression-free survival and response rate were likely to lead to a gain in overall survival, although currently this would be difficult to quantify.\n provided evidence from uncontrolled phase II trials that reported the benefits of adding rituximab to other chemotherapy regimens for the first-line treatment of people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. The Committee discussed the methodological limitations of obtaining an estimate of clinical effectiveness from uncontrolled and historical comparison studies. In addition, the Committee discussed the further evidence from comparative studies of follicular lymphoma provided by the manufacturer in response to consultation on the appraisal consultation document. The Committee was specifically mindful of comments from consultees about the addition of rituximab to chlorambucil for the treatment of people who are unable to tolerate fludarabine therapies. It accepted that it was reasonable to expect that rituximab would be of benefit when added to any chemotherapy regimen. However, the Committee considered that the additional comparative studies provided by the manufacturer involved the use of more toxic regimens than chlorambucil and were likely to have enrolled people who were on average younger and had a better performance status than people treated with chlorambucil in clinical practice. The Committee were not persuaded that the estimates of treatment effects from different studies were transferable. The Committee heard from clinical specialists that they considered that there was no evidence to support adding rituximab to chlorambucil, but that there was an ongoing trial investigating this. The Committee concluded that there was considerable uncertainty about the relative clinical benefit associated with adding rituximab to chemotherapy regimens other than fludarabine and cyclophosphamide in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.\nThe Committee was aware that fludarabine and cyclophosphamide were administered intravenously in the CLL-8 trial. It heard from clinical specialists that these chemotherapy agents were routinely administered orally in the NHS. The Committee accepted that the efficacy of both methods of administration was equivalent as long as doses were adjusted to ensure equivalent bioavailability.\nThe Committee heard from patient experts that progression-free survival was associated with a marked improvement in quality of life compared with the symptomatic progressed state. Patient experts commented that the first treatment-induced remission was likely to be the longest and associated with the most substantial improvements in quality of life. For this reason people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia valued having a choice of first-line treatments.\n\n【5】 # Cost effectiveness\nThe Committee discussed the economic model submitted by the manufacturer. It noted that the manufacturer had only presented estimates of cost effectiveness for rituximab in combination with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, and that this was compared with fludarabine in combination with cyclophosphamide and chlorambucil monotherapy. The Committee heard from clinical specialists that for those people for whom chlorambucil was the most appropriate treatment (that is, people with poor performance status or comorbidities), rituximab in combination with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide would not be considered an appropriate treatment option. Therefore the Committee was not persuaded that the comparison of rituximab in combination with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide with chlorambucil was valid as the chemotherapy regimens were used in different populations and such a choice between the two treatments was not expected to be clinically meaningful.\nThe Committee reviewed the manufacturer's economic model and the critique of it by the ERG. The Committee noted that the model was based on all people entering the model in the progression-free survival health state and moving to the progressed health state, and did not allow people to move from the progressed health state to the progression-free survival health state. The Committee was mindful that the economic model allowed for costs of subsequent lines of therapy to be included but noted that this did not allow any benefit from further therapy to be taken into account. More importantly a single transition probability from the progressed health state to death was applied to people from both trial groups in the progressed health state. The Committee recognised that although the manufacturer had not assumed any relative advantage in survival following progression, the use of a single transition probability from the progressed health state to death had the effect of associating improved progression-free survival with improved overall survival. The Committee considered that the assumed association between progression-free survival and overall survival in the model could overestimate the benefits of the clinical effectiveness of rituximab as taken from the CLL-8 trial, because this had not demonstrated a statistically significant difference in overall survival between treatment groups.\nThe Committee discussed the analysis by the ERG that suggested that two-thirds of the QALY gain (0.64 out of 0. in the model was because of the modelled improvement in overall survival, which is driven by gain in progression-free survival being reflected in gain in overall survival. The Committee noted that when the overall survival benefit was removed from the model the ICER increased from £13,000 to £30,000 per QALY gained. The Committee recognised therefore that the assumption about the amount of gain in overall survival from treatment with rituximab was an important assumption in the economic model and the use of different assumptions could have a large impact on the estimates of cost effectiveness.\n\n【6】 The Committee discussed the additional exploratory analysis done by the ERG using an assumption that the actual survival benefit from treatment with rituximab was somewhere between that presented in the base case and an assumption that there was no gain in survival  section 3.. The Committee noted that the probability, using the base-case utilities (that is, 0.80 for the progression-free survival health state and 0.60 for the progressed health state), of rituximab in combination with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide being cost effective at £20,000 per QALY gained was 71% and at £30,000 per QALY gained was 87%. On balance, the Committee was persuaded that even taking into account the additional uncertainty about the utility values, the economic analysis had demonstrated that rituximab in combination with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide for the first-line treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia was a cost-effective use of NHS resources.\nThe Committee considered the economic analysis provided by the manufacturer after consultation on the appraisal consultation document. It examined the assumptions used in the economic modelling for the comparison of rituximab and chlorambucil with chlorambucil alone. The Committee noted that the economic analysis assumed that the hazard ratio observed in the CLL-8 trial was exactly transferable to other chemotherapy regimens. However, the Committee noted that subgroup analyses of the CLL-8 trial demonstrated that there were differences in effect between different subgroups of patients based on age and staging. The Committee recognised that the marketing authorisation for rituximab allowed its use with any chemotherapy regimen. However, the Committee was not persuaded that the relative effects of the treatment or hazard ratio were transferable between various chemotherapies combined with rituximab and between different subgroups of people.\n aware that the analysis did not allow for the possibility of increased costs and disutilities because of adverse events that a population with poorer performance status or comorbidities may experience. The Committee considered that these uncertainties could make the ICER for rituximab in combination with chlorambucil considerably less favourable.\nThe Committee agreed that the uncertainty regarding the relative clinical effectiveness and the assumptions that had to be included in the additional economic analysis did not support the clinical and cost effectiveness of the use of rituximab in combination with chlorambucil. The Committee was therefore not persuaded that it could recommend rituximab in combination with chlorambucil as a cost-effective use of NHS resources. The Committee noted that the group of patients who are not suifor a regimen of fludarabine in combination with cyclophosphamide, and who might therefore be treated with rituximab in combination with chlorambucil, would include a high proportion of people with poor performance status or comorbidities. The Committee considered whether the equalities legislation and the requirement for fairness meant that it should make a positive recommendation for rituximab in combination with chlorambucil for this group. However the Committee noted that a negative recommendation for rituximab in combination with chlorambucil did not appear to have an impact on any group protected by the equalities legislation. It is not obvious that there is a clear correlation between the comorbidity factors which rendered this patient group unsuifor certain chemotherapies and 'disability' as defined in the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. The Committee could not be satisfied that a negative recommendation of rituximab in combination with chlorambucil represented less favourable treatment or loss of benefit, given the lack of clear evidence as to the relative clinical effectiveness of rituximab in combination with chlorambucil in this particular patient group. Given the lack of evidence for both the clinical and cost effectiveness of this combination, the Committee could not justify a positive recommendation of rituximab in combination with chlorambucil.\nThe Committee was aware that new data on the combination of rituximab with chlorambucil in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia would soon be available. It considered that even though this was not a comparative trial, the data could potentially provide more certain estimates of cost effectiveness of rituximab in combination with chlorambucil. The Committee therefore agreed that the current guidance should be reviewed when all data from the ongoing trial become available.# Related NICE guidance\nFludarabine monotherapy for the first-line treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.

Please be sure to attach your CV and or biographical sketch.\nMania (from Greek μανία and that from μαίνομαι - mainomai, \"to rage, to be furious\") is a severe medical condition characterized by extremely elevated mood, energy, unusual thought patterns and sometimes psychosis. There are several possible causes for mania, but it is most often associated with bipolar disorder, where episodes of mania may cyclically alternate with episodes of clinical depression. These cycles may relate to diurnal rhythms and environmental stressors. Mania varies in intensity, from mild mania (known as hypomania) to full-blown mania with psychotic features (hallucinations and delusions).\n been associated with creativity and artistic talent.\n\n【1】 # Symptoms\nSymptoms of mania include rapid speech, racing thoughts, decreased need for sleep, hypersexuality, euphoria, impulsiveness, grandiosity, and increased interest in goal-directed activities. Mild forms of mania, known as hypomania, cause little or no impairment, but most people who suffer from prolonged hypomania due to bipolar disorder develop full mania.\nAnother symptom of mania is racing thoughts during which the sufferer is excessively distracted by unimportant stimuli. This negative experience creates an inability to function and an absentmindedness where the manic individual's thoughts totally preoccupy him or her, making him or her unable to keep track of time or be aware of anything besides the neurological pattern of thoughts.\nManic symptoms include irritability, anger or rage, delusions, hypersensitivity, hypersexuality, hyper-religiosity, hyperactivity, impulsiveness, racing thoughts, talkativeness, pressure to keep talking or rapid speech,  and grandiose ideas and plans, decreased need for sleep (e.g. feels rested after 3 or 4 hours of sleep).  In manic and hypomanic cases, the afflicted person may engage in out of character behavior such as questionable business transactions, wasteful expenditures of money, risky sexual activity, abnormal social interaction, or highly vocal arguments uncharacteristic of previous behaviors.  These behaviors increase stress in personal relationships, problems at work and increases the risk of altercations with law enforcement as well as being at high risk of impulsively taking part in activities potentially harmful to self and others.\n often be complicated by the sufferer's lack of judgment and insight regarding periods of exacerbation of symptoms.  Manic patients are frequently grandiose, obsessive, impulsive, irri, belligerent, and frequently deny anything is wrong with them.  Because mania frequently encourages high energy and decreased perception of need or ability to sleep, within a few days of a manic cycle, sleep-deprived psychosis may appear, further complicating the ability to think clearly.  Racing thoughts and misperceptions lead to frustration and decreased ability to communicate with others.\n feel irri, frustrated, and may experience derealization.\nA mnemonic used to remember the symptoms of mania is DIGFAST:\n- D = Distractibility\n- I = Indiscretion\n- G = Grandiosity\n- F = Flight of ideas\n- A = Activity increased\n- S = Sleep (decreased need for)\n- T = Talkativeness (pressured speech)\n\n【2】 # Mixed states\nMania can be experienced at the same time as depression, in a mixed episode. Dysphoric mania is primarily manic and agitated depression is primarily depressed. This has caused speculation amongst doctors that mania and depression are two independent axes in a bipolar spectrum, rather than opposites.\n manic have the energy needed to commit the act and the thoughts of depression that would lead them initially to suicide.\n\n【3】 # Hypomania\nHypomania is a lowered state of mania that does little to impair function or decrease quality of life according.  In hypomania there is less need for sleep, goal motivated behavior and increased metabolism.  Though the elevated mood and energy level typical of hypomania could be seen as a benefit, mania itself generally has many undesirable consequences including suicidal tendencies.\n\n【4】 # Associated disorders\nA single manic episode is sufficient to diagnose Bipolar I Disorder.  Hypomania may be indicative of Bipolar II Disorder or Cyclothymia.  However, if prominent psychotic symptoms are present for a duration significantly longer than the mood episode, a diagnosis of Schizoaffective Disorder is more appropriate.\n\n【5】 # Medical treatment\nBefore beginning treatment for mania, careful differential diagnosis must be performed to rule out non-psychiatric causes.\nAcute mania in bipolar disorder is typically treated with mood stabilizers and/or antipsychotic medication. Note that these treatments need to be prescribed and monitored carefully to avoid harmful side-effects such as neuroleptic malignant syndrome with the antipsychotic medications. It may be necessary to temporarily admit the patient involuntarily until the patient is stabilized.  Antipsychotics and mood stabilizers help stabilize mood of those with mania or depression. They work by blocking the receptor for the neurotransmitter dopamine and allowing serotonin to still work, but in diminished capacity.\nWhen the symptoms of mania have gone, long-term treatment then focuses on prophylactic treatment to try to stabilize the patient's mood, typically through a combination of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy.\n used for prophylaxis. More recent drug solutions include lamotrigine.\n\n【6】 # Psychopharmacology\n appear to play important roles. The temporal lobe is involved in speech, listening, reading, word association and contains the amygdala, the almond shaped emotional center for the brain. The left amygdala is more active in women who are manic and the orbitofrontal cortex is less active .  Emotional stimulation creates the ability for life events to be stored more vividly in the memory. In women, the amygdala becomes similar to one of a manic woman during sex combined with menstruation.\nBipolar disorder is different for men than it is for women. Mania affects the hypothalamus and the pituitary-adrenal-axis by causing it to secrete hormones in different amounts, that accounts for hypersexuality, changes in metabolism, and misdiagnosis as hormonal imbalance.  Because the hormone problem stems from a neurological problem hormone therapy isn't the best solution.  If serotonin levels are s, hormones secreted by the pituitary gland will stabilize.  Bipolar disorder is similar to a thought disorder combined with hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism.\nIn the study done by Brentwood VA Medical Center in Los Angeles, California, antidepressants were taken during mania.  One third of bipolar patients developed antidepressant induced mania from their healthy state and one fourth developed antidepressant induced rapid cycling from their healthy state.  For those with type II bipolar disorder, antidepressants decrease the gaps between the depression and mania .\n\n【7】 # Mania and over the counter drugs\nPhenylpropanolamine (PPA) is a sympathomimetic drug similar in structure to amphetamine which was formerly present in over 130 medications, primarily decongestants, cough/cold remedies, and anorectic agents.\nA report on PPA, from the Dept. of Psychiatry, F. Edward Hebert School of Medicine, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, Maryland. Pharmacopsychiatry 1988 stated:\nPPA is no longer available in any medication in the United States as of the year 2000.\n\n【8】 # Personal accounts\nIn Electroboy: A Memoir of Mania by Andy Behrman, he describes his experience of mania as \"the most perfect prescription glasses with which to see the  appears in front of you like an oversized movie screen\" .  Behrman indicates early in his memoir that he sees himself not as a person suffering from an uncontrollable disabling illness, but as a director of the movie that is his vivid and emotionally alive life.  \"When I'm manic, I'm so awake and alert, that my eyelashes fluttering on the pillow sound like thunder\" .", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Serious neurological sequelae may sometimes occur.\n be used to reduce nerve pain in the short term.

Using fluoroscopic guidance, an introducer needle is inserted into the affected disc. A small radiofrequency probe is then inserted through the needle and into the disc. The probe delivers radiofrequency energy to create a plasma field at its tip, which causes ablation of the tissue at temperatures of 40–70°C. When it has reached a pre‑determined depth the probe is removed, coagulating the tissue as it is withdrawn. Around 6 channels are created during the procedure, the number of channels depending on the amount of tissue reduction needed. The aim is to remove tissue from the disc nucleus without damaging surrounding structures.# Efficacy\nThis section describes efficacy outcomes from the published literature that the Committee considered as part of the evidence about this procedure. For more detailed information on the evidence, see the interventional procedure overview.\nA systematic review of 27 studies, including 3211 patients treated by percutaneous coblation, reported that pain measured on a visual analogue scale (VAS; range 0–10, where 0 is no pain and 10 is the greatest imaginable pain) decreased after percutaneous coblation from 7.27 (n= at baseline to 2.84 at 3 months (n=612, p<0., 3.03 at 12 months (n=702, p<0., and 3.69 at 24 months (n=92, p<0..

A non‑randomised comparative study of 160 patients treated by percutaneous coblation or open discectomy reported that the VAS score for pain reduced from 7.9 and 8.0 at baseline to 2.2 and 1.8, respectively, at 12 month follow‑up (p values not reported).\nA randomised controlled trial (RCT) of 118 patients treated by percutaneous coblation alone, percutaneous coblation combined with nerve root steroid injection, or epidural steroid injection reported that the mean numeric rating scale for pain decreased from 7.15, 7.29 and 7.31 at baseline to 2.27, 2.14 and 3.44, respectively, at 12‑month follow‑up (p<0.001 for all 3 compared with baseline; p<0.001 for percutaneous coblation compared against epidural injection).

{"seq_id": "97008c08-4fac-4bd6-9b4a-550be8423014", "title": null, "text": "【0】 Emergency Alert System\nThe Emergency Alert System (EAS) is a national system in the U.S. put into place in 1994, superseding the Emergency Broadcast System (EBS) and is jointly coordinated by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Federal Emergency Managemant Agency (FEMA), and the National Weather Service (NWS).  The official EAS is designed to enable the President of the United States to speak to the United States within 10 minutes (this official federal EAS has never been activated).  The EAS regulations and standards are governed by the Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau of the FCC. Each State and several territories have their own EAS plan.\n\n【1】 Listen to:Template:Audio\n\n【2】 # Technical concept\nMessages in the EAS are comprised of four parts: a digitally encoded SAME header, an attention signal, an audio announcement, and a digitally encoded end-of-message marker.\nThe Template:Audio is the most critical part of the EAS design. It contains information about who originated the alert (the President, state or local authorities, the National Weather Service, or the broadcaster), a short, general description of the event (tornado, flood, severe thunderstorm), the areas affected (up to 32 counties or states), the expected duration of the event (in minutes), the date and time it was issued (in UTC), and an identification of the originating station.  (\n30+ radio stations are designated as National Primary Stations in the Primary Entry Point (PEP) System to distribute Presidential messages to other broadcast stations and cable systems. The Emergency Action Notification is the notice to broadcasters that the President of the United States or his designee will deliver a message over the EAS via the PEP system. \"You {AM and FM broadcasters} will hear the following Emergency Action Notification\nMessage from the EAS decoder. This is an Emergency Action Notification requested by the White House. All broadcast stations will follow activation procedures in the EAS Operating Handbook for a national\nlevel emergency. The President of the United States or his representative will shortly deliver a message over the Emergency Alert System.\" \nBecause the header lacks error detection codes it is repeated three times for redundancy.  EAS decoders compare the received headers against one another, looking for an exact match between any two, eliminating most errors which can cause an activation to fail.  The decoder then decides whether to ignore the message or whether to relay it on the air based on whether the message applies to the local area served by the station (following parameters set by the broadcaster).\nThe SAME header bursts are followed by an Template:Audio which lasts between eight and 25 seconds, depending on the originating station. The tone is Template:Audio on a NOAA Weather Radio station, while on commercial broadcast stations, it consists of a \"two tone\" combination of 853 Hz and 960 Hz sine waves and is the same attention signal used by the older Emergency Broadcast System.  The \"two tone\" system is no longer required as of 1998 and is to be used only for audio alerts before EAS messages. Like the EBS, the attention signal is followed by a voice message describing the details of the alert.\nThe message ends with three bursts of the AFSK \"EOM\", or End of Message, which is the text NNNN, preceded each time by the binary 10101011 calibration.\nThe White House has endorsed the migration to the Common Alerting Protocol and FEMA is in the process of testing implementation.\n\n【3】 # Station requirements\nThe FCC requires all broadcast stations to install and maintain EAS decoders and encoders at their control points.  These decoders continuously monitor the signals from other nearby broadcast stations for EAS messages.  For reliability, at least two other source stations must be monitored, one of which must be a designated local primary.  Stations are to retain the latest version of the EAS handbook.\n be kept electronically inside the unit as long as there is access to an external printer or method to transfer them to a personal computer.\n transmit a visual message. A text \"crawl\" is displayed at the top of the screen.  A color coded \"crawl\" system is often used where the color signifies the  priority of the message.  Some television stations transmit only the visual message which is outside of the requirements.  A television station may be used for monitoring by another station and thus the audio is necessary.\n\n【4】 Some stations may be non-participating, and do not relay messages.  Instead they transmit a message instructing listeners/viewers to tune to another station for the information, and they must then suspend their operation.\n\n【5】 # Testing the System\nAll EAS equipment must be tested weekly.  The required weekly test (RWT) consists of the header and the end-of-message SAME bursts.  The RWT need not contain an audio message nor are voice or graphic messages announcing the test are required, although many stations will provide them as a courtesy to the listener or viewer.  Television stations are not required to transmit a video message for weekly tests.  RWTs are scheduled by the station, alternating between night and day, and are not relayed.\nOn cable systems before the start of the EAS test, all of a system's channels are redirected to one analog channel which is received on all tiers of service, but doesn't usually give out news or weather information (such as the TV Guide Network, QVC, HSN, or a public access station), where the test occurs from the local headend office or from the system's master office elsewhere in the region.  Newer technology allows cable DVR and video on demand systems to interrupt playback of a program for an EAS test.  After the test ends, the one channel usually remains on screen for 5-10 addition seconds before the original station/network is returned to.\nRequired Monthly Tests (RMTs) are generally originated by the primary relay station or a State's EAS agency, relayed by broadcast and cable stations. RMTs are conducted with the following procedure:\n- Normal programming is suspended, and an announcement may be made such as: \"This is a test of the Emergency Alert System. This is only a test.\"\n- The SAME Header burst is sent, perhaps followed by an attention signal.\n- Another voice message is sent, which runs something like this:\n\"This is a coordinated monthly test of the broadcast stations in your area. Equipment that can quickly warn you during emergencies is being tested.  If this had been an actual emergency such as (insert types of messages that may occur in the geographic area) , official messages would have followed the alert tone.  This concludes this test of the Emergency Alert System.\"\n- The SAME EOM burst is sent.\nRMTs must be performed between 8:30AM and local sunset during odd numbered months, and local sunset to 8:30AM for even months.  Received tests must be retransmitted inside 60 minutes from receipt.\nAn RWT is not required during a calendar week in which an RMT is scheduled.  No testing has to be done at all during a calendar week in which the EAS has been legitimately activated. Occasionally a periodic national test may be conducted.\n\n【6】 # Additions and proposals\nThe number of event types in the national system has grown to eighty.  At first, almost all but three of the events were weather-related, the remaining types dedicated for civil emergencies.  Since then, several classes of non-weather emergencies have been added, including, in most states, the AMBER Alert System for child abduction emergencies.\n\n【7】 # EAS for consumers\nEAS is designed to be useful for the entire public, not just those with SAME-capable equipment.  However, several consumer-level radios do exist, especially weather radio receivers, which are available to the public through both mail-order and retailers like Radio Shack, Circuit City, and several others.  Other specialty receivers for AM/FM/ACSSB(R)(LM(R)) are available only through mail-order, or in some places from federal, state, or local governments, especially where there is a potential hazard nearby such as a nuclear plant or chemical factory.  These radios come pre-tuned to a station in each area that has agreed to provide this service to local emergency management officials and agencies, often with a direct link back to the plant's safety system or control room for instant activation should an evacuation or other emergency arise.\nThe ability to narrow messages down so that only the actual area in danger is alerted is extremely helpful in preventing false warnings, which was previously a major tune-out factor.  Instead of sounding for all warnings within a station's area, SAME-decoder radios now sound only for the counties they are programmed for.  When the alarm sounds, anyone with the radio knows that the danger is nearby and protective action should be taken.  For this reason, the goal of the National Weather Service is that each home should have both a smoke detector and a SAME weather radio.\nA private website called the Emergency Email Network offers to send an email or SMS text message to registered users in the event of an EAS activation.  Some desktop weather monitoring programs, such as WeatherBug, offer a computer alert during emergencies.\nCurrently under development is new infrastructure called the Digital Emergency Alert System.  This system would allow the transmission of emergency alerts directly to citizens and responders without the need for a special receiver.  These alerts would be sent to users of computers, mobile phones, pagers, and other devices.\n\n【8】 # Incidents\n . . the EAS was not activated nationally or regionally in New York or Washington during the terrorist attacks on the nation.\" Richard Rudman, then chairman of the EAS National Advisory Committee explained that near immediate coverage in the national media meant that the media itself provided the warning or alert of what had happened at what might happen as quickly as the information could be distributed. \"Some events really do serve as their own alerts and warnings. With the immediate live media coverage, the need for an EAS warning was lessened.\" 34 PEP stations were kept  on high alert for use if the President had decided to order an Emergency Action Notification. \"PEP is really is a last-ditch effort to get a message out if the president cannot get to the media.\" \n Officials at the Office of Emergency Management announced that the activation and broadcast of the Emergency Alert System was in error due to possibly the wrong button being pressed. \"State police said they received no calls related to the erroneous alert.\"\n This was followed by dead air and then WGN-AM  radio (the station designated to simulcast the alert message) being played on almost every television and radio station in the Chicago area and throughout much of Illinois . The accidental EAN activation was caused when a government contractor installing a new satellite receiver as part of a new national delivery path incorrectly left the receiver connected and wired to the state EOC's EAS transmitter before final closed circuit testing of the new delivery path had been completed. \n\n【9】  in some songs.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Such devices are often based on microscopic phenomena such as thermal noise or the photoelectric effect or other quantum phenomena. These processes are, in theory, completely unpredic, and the theory's assertions of unpredictability are subject to experimental test. A quantum-based hardware random number generator typically contains an amplifier to bring the output of the physical process into the macroscopic realm, and a transducer to convert the output into a digital signal.\n be built from macroscopic phenomena, such as playing cards, dice, and the roulette wheel. The presence of unpredictability in these phenomena can be justified by the theory of unsdynamical systems and chaos theory. These theories suggest that even though macroscopic phenomena are deterministic in theory under Newtonian mechanics, real-world systems evolve in ways that cannot be predicted in practice because one would need to know the micro-details of initial conditions and subsequent manipulation or change.\nAlthough dice have been mostly used in gambling, and in recent times as 'randomizing' elements in games (e.g. role playing games), the Victorian scientist Francis Galton described a way to use dice to explicitly generate random numbers for scientific purposes, in 1890. Though some gamblers believe they can control their throws of dice enough to win at dice games (a claim which has been long debated), no one has produced a way to exploit the claimed effect in either generating or attacking physical randomness sources.\nHardware random number generators are often relatively slow, and they may produce a biased sequence (i.e., some values are more common than others). Whether a hardware random number generator is suifor a particular application depends on the details of both the application and the generator.\n\n【1】 # Pseudo-random generators\n being readily, even trivially, predic\nAlgorithmic information theory defines a sequence of bits as non-random if it can be produced by some computer program that is shorter than that sequence (Chaitin-Kolmogorov randomness). Pseudo-random number generators fail that test dramatically. They can usually be programmed in a few thousand bits, but can produce far larger sequences, with periods so long no currently plausible computer or combination of them could exhaust a single period before the heat death of the Universe.\nThere are several informal definitions of randomness, usually based on either a lack of discernible patterns in a sequence, or the unpredictability of the sequence or various aspects of it by, generally, the most puissant possible adversary. Output from well-designed pseudo-random number generators should pass assorted statistical tests probing for non-randomness  NIST Special Publication 800-22, Knuth, The Art of Computer Programming, vol. 2, and RFC 4086 for details of many such tests).\nThe sequences such generators produce always have patterns, in one sense, since the algorithm that generates them has a finite state, and must, eventually, repeat one of those states. Given the original state of the generator, and the implementation of the algorithm, a pseudo-random number generator of this sort is totally predic Given even partial knowledge of that state, they are often insecure for many purposes. On the other hand, it has become relatively easy to produce pseudo-random number generators that are guaranteed not to repeat on any currently plausible computer within a time-frame that is millions of times longer than the age of the universe. It is an open question whether it is always possible, in some practical way, to distinguish the output of such a  pseudo-random number generator from that of a perfectly random source, without knowledge of the generator's internal state. Much of modern cryptography rests on the assumption that ciphers can be constructed whose output is indistinguishable from random noise without knowledge of a secret key used in the algorithm.\n\n【2】 # Uses\nUnpredicrandom numbers were first investigated in the context of gambling, and many randomizing devices such as dice, shuffling playing cards, and roulette wheels, were first developed for use in gambling. Fairly produced random numbers are vital to electronic gambling and ways of creating them are sometimes regulated by governmental gaming commissions.\n evident in ancient writings, for example in the Book of Numbers (33:, Moses commands the Israelites to apportion the land by lot (Template:Lang-he). And the drawing of lots, often pottery shards, are well attested in the Classical world of Greece and Rome. Some of these very shards have been archeologically recovered.\n\n【3】 # Early attempts\nOne early way of producing random numbers was by a variation of the same machines used to play keno or select lottery numbers.  Basically, these mixed numbered ping-pong balls with blown air, perhaps combined with mechanical agitation, and use some method to withdraw balls from the mixing chamber. This method gives reasonable results in some senses, but the random numbers generated by this means are expensive. The method is inherently slow, and is unusable in most automated situations, (i.e., with computers).\nIn 1927, Cambridge University Press published a book of Random sampling numbers, arranged by a statistician, Leonard Henry Caleb Tippett, which contained 41,600 digits taken from English parishes listed in census records. Other random number s were published in that era, including one by R. A. Fischer and another by the U.S. Interstate Commerce Commission in 1949 with over 100,000 random digits.\n Nothing up my sleeve numbers.\n\n【4】 # Physical phenomena with random properties\nThere are two fundamental sources of practical quantum mechanical physical randomness: quantum mechanics at the atomic or sub-atomic level and thermal noise (some of which is quantum mechanical in origin). Quantum mechanics predicts that certain physical phenomena, such as the nuclear decay of atoms, are fundamentally random and cannot, in principle, be predicted. (For a discussion of empirical verification of quantum unpredictability, see Bell test experiments.)  And, because we live at a finite, non-zero temperature, every system has some random variation in its state; for instance, molecules of air are constantly bouncing off each other in a random way.  (  This randomness is a quantum phenomenon as well. (\nBecause the outcome of quantum-mechanical events cannot in principle be predicted, they are the 'gold standard' for random number generation. Some quantum phenomena used for random number generation inclu\n- Shot noise, a quantum mechanical noise source in electronic circuits. A simple example is a lamp shining on a photodiode. Due to the uncertainty principle, arriving photons create noise in the circuit. Collecting the noise for use poses some problems, but this is an especially simple random noise source.\n- A nuclear decay radiation source (as, for instance, from some kinds of commercial smoke detectors), detected by a Geiger counter attached to a PC.\n- Photons travelling through a semi-transparent mirror, as in the commercial product, Quantis from id Quantique.  The mutually exclusive events (reflection — transmission) are detected and associated to \"0\" or \"1\" bit values respectively.\nThermal phenomena are easier to detect. They are (somewhat) vulnerable to attack by lowering the temperature of the system, though most systems will stop operating at temperatures (e.g., ~150 K) low enough to reduce noise by a factor of two. Some of the thermal phenomena used inclu\n- Thermal noise from a resistor, amplified to provide a random voltage source.\n- Avalanche noise generated from an avalanche diode, or Zener breakdown noise from a reverse-biased zener diode.\n- Atmospheric noise, detected by a radio receiver attached to a PC (though much of it, such as lightning noise, is not properly thermal noise, but most likely a chaotic phenomenon).\nAnother variable physical phenomenon that is easy to measure is clock drift.\nIn the absence of quantum effects or thermal noise, other phenomena that tend to be random, although in ways not easily characterized by laws of physics, can be used. When several such sources are combined carefully (as in, for example, the Yarrow algorithm or Fortuna CSPRNGs), enough entropy can be collected for the  creation of cryptographic keys and nonces, though generally at restricted rates. The advantage is that this approach needs, in principle, no special hardware. The disadvantage is that a sufficiently knowledgable attacker can surreptitiously modify the software or its inputs, thus reducing the randomness of the output, perhaps substantially. The primary source of randomness typically used in such approaches is the precise timing of the interrupts caused by mechanical input/output devices, such as keyboards and disk drives, various system information counters, etc.\nThis last approach must be implemented carefully and may be subject to attack if it is not. For instance, the generator built into the Linux kernel, which combines several such sources, may be vulnerable to an attack . The random number generator used for cryptographic purposes in an early version of the Netscape browser was certainly vulnerable (and was promptly changed).\n always be taken when amplifying low-level noise to keep out spurious signals, such as power line hum and unwanted broadcast transmissions, and to avoid adding bias during acquisition and amplification. In some simple designs, the fluctuating logic value is converted to an RS-232 type signal and presented to a computer's serial port. Software then sees this series of logic values as bursts of \"line noise\" characters on an I/O port. More sophisticated systems may format the bit values before passing them into a computer.\nAnother approach is to feed an analog noise signal to an analog to digital converter, such as the audio input port built into most personal computers. The digitized signal may then be processed further in software to remove bias. However, digitization is itself often a source of bias, sometimes subtle, so this approach requires considerable caution and care.\nSome have suggested using digital cameras, such as webcams, to photograph chaotic macroscopic phenomena. A group at Silicon Graphics  imaged Lava lamps to generate random numbers. U.S. Patent 5,732,138 One problem was determining whether the chaotic shapes generated were actually random -- the team decided that they are in properly operating Lava lamps.  Other chaotic scenes could be employed, such as the motion of streamers in a fan air stream or, probably, bubbles in a fish tank (fish optional). The digitized image will generally contain additional noise, perhaps not very random, resulting from the video to digital conversion process.\nA higher quality device might use two sources and eliminate signals that are common to both— depending on the sources and their physical locations, this reduces or eliminates interference from outside electric and magnetic fields.  This is often recommended for gambling devices, to reduce cheating by requiring attackers to exploit bias in several \"random bit\" streams.\nThe Commodore C64 provided a hardware random number generator, included in its soundchip, the MOS Technology SID 6581. Random bytes are fetchable by a read on the correct memory address on the 6581.\n\n【5】 ## Clock drift\nThere are several ways to measure and use clock drift as a source of randomness.\nThe Intel 80802 Firmware Hub chip included a hardware RNG using two free running oscillators, one fast and one slow. A thermal noise source (non-commonmode noise from two diodes) is used to modulate the frequency of the slow oscillator, which then triggers a measurement of the fast oscillator. That output is then debiased using a von Neumann type decorrelation step  below). The output rate of this device is somewhat less than 100,000 bit/s. This chip was an optional component of the 840 chipset family that supported an earlier Intel bus. It is not included in modern PCs.\nAll VIA C3 microprocessors have included a hardware RNG on the processor chip since 2003. Instead of using thermal noise, raw bits are generated by using four freerunning oscillators which are designed to run at different rates. The output of two are XORed to control the bias on a third oscillator, whose output clocks the output of the fourth oscillator to produce the raw bit. Minor variations in temperature, silicon characteristics, and local electrical conditions cause continuing oscillator speed variations and thus produce the entropy of the raw bits. To further ensure randomness, there are actually two such RNGs on each chip, each positioned in different environments and rotated on the silicon. The final output is a mix of these two generators. The raw output rate is tens to hundreds of megabits per second, and the whitened rate is a few megabits per second. User software can access the generated random bit stream using new non-privileged machine language instructions.\nA software implementation of a related idea on ordinary hardware is included in CryptoLib, a cryptographic routine library (JB Lacy, DP Mitchell, WM Schell, CryptoLib: Cryptography in software, Proc 4th USENIX Security Symp, pg 1-17, . The algorithm is called truerand. Most modern computers have two crystal oscillators, one for the real-time clock and one for the primary CPU clock; truerand exploits this fact. It uses an operating system service that sets an alarm, running off the real-time clock. One subroutine sets that alarm to go off in one clock tick (usually 1/60th of a second). Another then enters a while loop waiting for the alarm to trigger. Since the alarm will not always trigger in exactly one tick, the least significant bits of a count of loop iterations, between setting the alarm and its trigger, will vary randomly, possibly enough for some uses. Truerand doesn't require additional hardware, but in a multi-tasking system great care must be taken to avoid non-randomizing interference from other processes (e.g., in the suspension of the counting loop process as the operating system scheduler starts and stops assorted processes).\n\n【6】 # Dealing with bias\nThe bit-stream from such systems is prone to be biased, with either 1s or 0s predominating.  There are two approaches to dealing with bias and other artifacts. The first is to design the RNG to minimize bias inherent in the operation of the generator. One method to correct this feeds back the generated bit stream, filtered by a low-pass filter, to adjust the bias of the generator.  By the central limit theorem, the feedback loop will tend to be well-adjusted 'almost all the time'. Ultra-high speed random number generators often use this method. Even then, the numbers generated are usually somewhat biased.\n\n【7】 ## Software whitening\nA second approach to coping with bias is to reduce it after generation  (in software or hardware). Even if the above hardware bias reduction steps have been taken, the bit-stream should still be assumed to contain bias and correlation. There are several techniques for reducing bias and correlation, often known by the name \"whitening\" algorithms, by analogy with the related problem of producing white noise from a correlated signal.\nJohn von Neumann invented a simple algorithm to fix simple bias, and reduce correlation. It considers bits two at a time, taking one of three actions: when two successive bits are equal, they are not used as a random bit; a sequence of 1,0 becomes a 1; and a sequence of 0,1 becomes a zero.  This eliminates simple bias, and is easy to implement as a computer program or in digital logic. This technique works no matter how the bits have been generated. It cannot assure randomness in its output, however.  What it can do (with significant numbers of discarded bits) is transform a random bit stream with a frequency of 1's different from 50% into a stream closer to that frequency.\nAnother technique for improving a near random bit stream is to exclusive-or the bit stream with the output of a high-quality cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator such as  Blum Blum Shub or a good stream cipher.  This can cheaply improve decorrelation and digit bias.\nA related method which reduces bias in a near random bit stream is to take two or more uncorrelated near random bit streams, and exclusive or them together.  Let the probability of a bit stream producing a 0 be 1/2 + e, where -1/2 ≤ e ≤ 1/2. Then e is the bias of the bitstream.  If two uncorrelated bit streams with bias e are exclusive-or-ed together, then the bias of the result will be 2e².  This may be repeated with more bit streams. (.\nSome designs apply cryptographic hash functions such as MD5, SHA-1, or RIPEMD-160 or even a CRC function to all or part of the bit stream, and then use the output as the random bit stream. This is attractive, partly because it is relatively fast compared to some other methods, but depends entirely on qualities in the hash output for which there may be little theoretical basis.\n\n【8】 ## PRNG with periodically refreshed random key\nOther designs use what are believed to be true random bits as the key for a high quality block cipher algorithm, taking the encrypted output as the random bit stream. Care must be taken in these cases to select an appropriate block mode, however. In some implementations, the PRNG is run for a limited number of digits, while the hardware generating device produces a new seed.\n\n【9】 # Using observed events\nSoftware engineers without true random number generators often try to develop them by measuring physical events available to the software. An example is measuring the time between user keystrokes, and then taking the least significant bit (or two or three) of the count as a random digit. A similar approach measures task-scheduling, network hits, disk-head seek times and other internal events. One Microsoft design includes a very long list of such internal values  the CSPRNG article).\n risky because the supposed user-generated event (e.g., keystrokes) can be spoofed by a sufficiently ingenious attacker, allowing control of the \"random values\" used by the cryptography.\nHowever, with sufficient care, a system can be designed that produces cryptographically secure random numbers from the sources of randomness available in a modern computer. The basic design is to maintain an \"entropy pool\" of random bits that are assumed to be unknown to an attacker.  New randomness is added whenever available (for example, when the user hits a key) and an estimate of the number of bits in the pool that cannot be known to an attacker is kept. Some of the strategies in use inclu\n- When random bits are requested, return that many bits derived from the entropy pool (by a cryptographic hash function, say) and decrement the estimate of the number of random bits remaining in the pool.  If not enough unknown bits are available, wait until enough are available.  This is the top-level design of the \"/dev/random\" device in Linux, written by Theodore Ts'o and used in many other Unix-like operating systems. It provides  high-quality random numbers so long as the estimates of the input randomness are sufficiently cautious.  The Linux \"/dev/urandom\" device is a simple modification which disregards estimates of input randomness, and is therefore rather less likely to have high entropy as a result.\n- Maintain a stream cipher with a key and IV obtained from an entropy pool.  When enough bits of entropy have been collected, replace both key and IV with new random values and decrease the estimated entropy remaining in the pool.  This is the approach taken by the yarrow library. It provides resistance against some attacks and conserves hard-to-obtain entropy.\n\n【10】 # Problems\nIt is very easy to misconstruct hardware or software devices which attempt to generate random numbers.  Also, most 'break' silently, often producing decreasingly random numbers as they degrade. A physical example might be the rapidly decreasing radioactivity of the smoke detectors mentioned earlier. Failure modes in such devices are plentiful and are complicated, slow, and hard to detect.\nBecause many entropy sources are often quite fragile, and fail silently, statistical tests on their output should be performed continuously. Many, but not all, such devices include some such tests into the software that reads the device.\n random number generator attack.\n\n【11】 ## Estimating entropy\nThere are mathematical techniques for estimating the entropy of a sequence of symbols. None are so reliable that their estimates can be fully relied upon; there are always assumptions which may be very difficult to confirm. These are useful for determining if there is enough entropy in a seed pool, for example, but they cannot, in general, distinguish between a true random source and a pseudo-random generator.\n\n【12】 ## Performance checks\nHardware random number generators should be constantly monitored for proper operation. RFC 4086 and FIPS Pub 140-2 include tests which can be used for this. Also see the documentation for the New Zealand cryptographic software library cryptlib.\nSince many practical designs rely on a hardware source as an input, it will be useful to at least check that the source is still operating. Statistical tests can often detect failure of a noise source, such as a radio station transmitting on a channel thought to be empty, for example. Noise generator output should be sampled for testing before being passed through a \"whitener.\" Some whitener designs can pass statistical tests with no random input. While detecting a large deviation from perfection would be a sign that a true random noise source has become degraded, small deviations are normal and can be an indication of proper operation. Correlation of bias in the inputs to a generator design with other parameters (e.g., internal temperature, bus voltage) might be additionally useful as a further check. Unfortunately, with currently available (and foreseen) tests, passing such tests is not enough to be sure the output sequences are random. A carefully chosen design, verification that the manufactured device implements that design and continuous physical security to insure against tampering may all be needed in addition to testing for high value uses.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

There are no changes to screening for overt diabetes (diabetes present before conception) in early pregnancy. This can be done in high-risk women with a hemoglobin A1c (A1c) or fasting plasma glucose if an A1c is unreliable. 2. This update suggests an option for GDM screening using an A1c and random plasma glucose. The use of this option should be based on each institution's clinical capacity and/or an individual's willingness to undergo screening during COVID-19. 3. We continue to reinforce the importance of healthy lifestyle for all women throughout pregnancy  resources below). 4. Postpartum screening for maternal dysglycemia should be deferred until after the COVID-19 pandemic is over. We do not recommend bringing women to an in-person healthcare appointment solely for an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) postpartum. 5. Whenever possible and using clinical judgement, clinicians should use telehealth devices (video or phone calls) to care for patients in order to reduce potential COVID-19 exposure to women and healthcare providers.# Introduction\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has already had a profound effect on both pregnant women and our interprofessional diabetes and pregnancy teams. Given this, we present GDM screening options to try to minimize exposure to pregnant women and limit healthcare resource utilization while still providing quality care. The risk of exposure to COVID-19 must be weighed against the benefit of widespread glucose screening and treatment of GDM. These guideline updates are temporary in nature and designed with the goal of preventing excess maternal and fetal morbidity rather than the current approach which is much more sensitive in detecting GDM cases. Once the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, GDM screening should revert to recommendations in the 2018 Diabetes Canada Clinical Practice Guidelines .\nWe have developed an alternate screening option which includes a provision for disruption to the OGTT, which may occur due to decrease laboratory staffing or locations, public health recommendations, or due to patient concern about COVID exposure during this test.\n\n【1】 # EARLY SCREENING\nWe recommend no changes to screening for overt diabetes early in pregnancy The test of choice continues to be an A1c or a fasting plasma glucose if an A1c is unreliable. All women screened in early pregnancy with negative testing should be re-screened at 24-28 weeks gestation.\n\n【2】 # REGULAR (24-28 WEEKS) SCREENING\nAnticipating that the COVID-19 pandemic may substantially reduce access to, capacity for, and safety of attending for laboratory testing in different regions at different times, we recommend an alternative screening strategy for GDM outside 2018 Diabetes Canada Clinical Practice Guidelines . We recommend that the decision to shift to using this alternative screening strategy be made at an institutional (or district / regional level, as applicable) rather than by individual clinicians.\n\n【3】 # Current GDM screening, as per 2018 CPG  may continue if there are only minimal disruptions to capacity for lab testing or treatment of GDM.\n- These recommend screening all pregnant women without pre-existing diabetes using a 50 g glucose challenge followed by a 75 g OGTT in those with a 1-hour glucose of 7.8-11.0 mmol/L .\nThis ALTERNATIVE SCREENING STRATEGY should be used if the COVID-19 pandemic causes severe disruptions to laboratory testing and treatment, and/or patient refusal.:\n- All pregnant women without pre-existing diabetes will be SCREENED WITH AN A1c & NON-FASTING, RANDOM PLASMA GLUCOSE\n- Women with an A1c of < 5.7% and a random plasma glucose < 11.1 mmol/L require no further testing or treatment.\n- Those with an A1c of  5.7% or a random plasma glucose of  11.1 mmol/L are identified as having GDM and should be referred to the interprofessional diabetes and pregnancy healthcare team.\n\n【4】 # Rationale:\nOf all the available screening tests, we chose an A1c and a random plasma glucose as they are easy, widely accessible, do not require fasting, and require minimal laboratory resources compared to other screening tests. Non-fasting labwork provides flexibility for women to attend for testing and may reduce the burden on laboratories, while potentially increasing the sensitivity of the glucose test. We recognize that this alternative screening option will miss many women with GDM as an A1c of 5.7% has high specificity (96% ) but low sensitivity (25% ) . This strategy is aimed at identifying only the highest risk women. A random plasma glucose of ≥ 11.1 mmol/l was chosen by consensus in order to avoid missing a woman with quite elevated glucose levels but in whom an A1c is unreliable (for example because of a hemoglobinopathy) . Testing can be repeated if previously negative at any time if there is a high clinical suspicion of diabetes.\nThe alternative screening strategy is displayed in  \n\n【5】 # POSTPARTUM SCREENING FOR TYPE 2 DIABETES\nPostpartum screening for maternal dysglycemia should be deferred until after the COVID-19 pandemic has ended. We do not recommend bringing women back solely for an OGTT.\n\n【6】 # VIRTUAL MANAGEMENT OF WOMEN WITH GESTATIONAL DIABETES\nWe suggest that, whenever possible and using clinical judgement, clinicians use telehealth devices (video or phone calls) to care for individuals in order to reduce exposure to women and healthcare providers. This can include initial and follow-up visits. When in-person visits are conducted as part of routine obstetric care, every effort should be made to share key clinical data (eg weight, blood pressure) obtained with subspecialty teams including the interprofessional diabetes and pregnancy teams.\n consider the use of video conference platforms to host virtual GDM classes and teach insulin injections.\nResources: Diabetes Canada and SOGC websites have helpful online resources:\n-  -  Information regarding healthy lifestyle can be found here:\n- /.

{"seq_id": "98763968-1b1b-41d5-b59d-4175cbd8d446", "title": null, "text": "【0】 ESFP\nESFP (Extroverted Sensing Feeling Perceiving) is one of the sixteen personality types which is used in the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) and is based on the well-known research of Carl Jung. Carl Jung first developed the theory that every person has their own psychological type. Myers and Briggs further developed Jung’s Theory. The MBTI preferences indicate the differences in people based on the following:\n-\tHow they focus their attention or get their energy (Extraversion or Introversion)\n-\tHow they perceive or take in information (Sensing or Intuition)\n-\tHow they prefer to make decisions (Thinking or Feeling)\n-\tHow they orient themselves to the external world (Judging or Perceiving)\nAs a person uses their preference in each of these areas, they develop what Jung and Myers defined as psychological type, which is an underlying personality pattern resulting from the dynamic interaction of their four preferences, environmental influences, and their own personal tendencies. People are likely to develop behaviors, skills, and attitudes based on their particular type. Each personality type has its own potential strengths as well as areas which need improvement.\n\n【1】 # MBTI Cognitive Functions\nThe attributes of each personality form a hierarchy.  This represents the person's \"default\" pattern of behavior in their day to day life. The Dominant is the personality type's preferred role, the task they feel most comforwith.  The auxiliary function is the role they feel the next most comforwith.  It serves to support and expand on the dominant function.  One of these first two will always be an information gathering function (sensing or intuition) and the other will be a decision making function(thinking or feeling) in some order. The tertiary function is less developed than the Dominant and Auxiliary functions, but develops as the person matures and provides roundness of ability.  The inferior function is the personality types Achilles' heel. This is the function they are least comforwith. Like the tertiary function, this function strengthens with maturity.\n- Dominant Extroverted Sensing (Se)\n- Auxiliary Introverted Feeling (Fi)\n- Tertiary Extroverted Thinking (Ti)\n- Inferior Introverted Intuition (Ni)\n\n【2】 # ESFP (Extraverted Sensing with Introverted Feeling)\nAccording to the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, people with ESFP preferences live life to the fullest. They live in the moment and find great enjoyment in people and material comforts. They rarely let conventions interfere with their lives and find creative ways to meet human needs.\nESFPs are excellent team players, focused on completing the task at hand with a maximum amount of fun and a minimum amount of discord.\n\n【3】 # Characteristics of ESFPs\nESFPs are interested in people and take pleasure in new experiences. Because they learn more by doing rather from studying or reading, they tend to rush into things, learning as they go. ESFPs are most likely to be\n-\tObservant\n-\tPractical, realistic, and specific\n-\tActive, involved in immediate experiences.\nESFPs make decisions by using their own personal standards. They use their Feeling judgment internally to make decisions by identifying and empathizing with others. They are good at interpersonal interactions and often play the role of peacemaker. Thus, ESFPs are likely to be\n-\tGenerous, optimistic, and persuasive\n-\tWarm, sympathetic, and tactful\nESFPs are keen observers of human behavior. Being attentive and observant by nature, they quickly sense what is happening with other people and immediately respond to their individual needs. They are especially good at mobilizing people to deal with crises.\n\n【4】 # How Others May Perceive Them\nESFPs get a lot of satisfaction out of life and are fun to be around. Their exuberance and enthusiasm draw others to them. They are flexible, adap, congenial, and easygoing. They seldom plan ahead, trusting their ability to respond in the moment and deal effectively with whatever presents itself. They dislike structure and routine and will generally find ways to bend the rules.\n learn by interacting with their environment. They usually dislike theory and written explanations. Traditional schools can be difficult for ESFPs, though they do extremely well when they see the relevance and are allowed to interact with people or the subject area being studied is of interest to them. Others usually see ESFPs as\n-\tResourceful and supportive\n-\tGregarious, fun-loving, playful, and spontaneous\n\n【5】 # Potential Areas for Growth\nSometimes life circumstances do not support ESFPs in the development and expression of the Feeling and Sensing preferences.\n-\tIf they have not developed their Feeling preference, ESFPs may get caught up in the interactions of the moment, with no mechanism for weighing, evaluating, or anchoring themselves.\n-\tIf they have not developed their Sensing preference, they may focus on the sensory data available in the moment. Their decisions may then be limited to gratification of the sensual desires, particularly those involving interactions with other people.\nIf ESFPs do not find a place where they can use their gifts and be appreciated for their contributions, they usually feel frustrated and may\n-\tBecome distracted and overly impulsive\n-\tHave trouble accepting and meeting deadlines\n-\tCan be hypersensitive and internalize others’ actions and decisions\nIt is natural for ESFPs to give less attention to their non-preferred Intuitive and Thinking parts. If they neglect these too much, they may\n-\tFail to look at long-term consequences, acting on immediate needs of themselves and others\n-\tAvoid complex or ambiguous situations and people\n-\tPut enjoyment ahead of obligations\nUnder great stress, ESFPs may feel overwhelmed internally by negative possibilities. They then put energy into developing simplistic global explanations for their negativity.\n\n【6】 # Things to Remember about Personality Type\nEach person is unique and there is not a right or wrong type. The purpose of learning about your type is to help you understand yourself better and to enhance your relationships with others. Your results on the MBTI suggest your probable type based on the choices you made when you answered the questions; however, only you know your true preference. Lastly, type does not explain everything. Human personality is much more complex.\n\n【7】 1. Myers, Isabel Briggs .

However, two other enzymes, tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TRP and TRP2, are required for a normal melanization process leading to eumelanin synthesis. In B16 melanoma cells, we demonstrated that stimulation of melanogenesis by cAMP-elevating agents results in an increase in tyrosinase, TRP1, and TRP2 expression. cAMP, through a cAMP-dependent protein kinase pathway, stimulates TRP1 and TRP2 promoter activities in both B16 mouse melanoma cells and normal human melanocytes. Regulation of the TRP1 and TRP2 promoters by cAMP involves a M box and an E box.\"\n\"icrophthalmia, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, strongly stimulates the transcriptional activities of the TRP1 and TRP2 promoters, mainly through binding to the M boxes.\"\n\"In mammals, pigmentation results from the synthesis and distribution of melanin in the skin, hair bulbs, and eyes. Melanin synthesis (melanogenesis) takes place in the melanocyte after differentiation of the nonpigmented precursor, the melanoblast . Three melanocyte-specific enzymes, tyrosinase, tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TRP, and TRP2, are involved in this enzymatic process that converts tyrosine to melanin pigments. Although these proteins have similar structures and features, they are expressed by different genes and possess distinct enzymatic activities.

They can be applied to any set of data that are naturally arranged into a tree, but have most applications in computational phylogenetics, especially in maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood searches of phylogenetic trees, which seek to identify one among many possible trees that best explains the evolutionary history of a particular gene or species.\n\n【1】 # Basic tree rearrangements\nThe simplest tree-rearrangement, known as nearest-neighbor interchange, exchanges the connectivity of four subtrees within the main tree. Because there are three possible ways of connecting four subtrees, and one is the original connectivity, each interchange creates two new trees. Exhaustively searching the possible nearest-neighbors for each possible set of subtrees is the slowest but most optimizing way of performing this search. An alternative, more wide-ranging search, subtree pruning and regrafting (SPR), selects and removes a subtree from the main tree and reinserts it elsewhere on the main tree to create a new node. Finally, tree bisection and reconnection (TBR) detaches a subtree from the main tree at an interior node and then attempts all possible connections between branches of the two trees thus created. The increasing complexity of the tree rearrangement technique correlates with increasing computational time required for the search, although not necessarily with their performance.\n\n【2】 # Tree fusion\nThe simplest type of tree fusion begins with two trees already identified as near-optimal; thus, they most likely have the majority of their nodes correct but may fail to resolve individual tree \"leaves\" properly; for example, the separation ((A,B),(C,D)) at a branch tip versus ((A,C),(B,D)) may be unresolved. Tree fusion swaps these two solutions between two otherwise near-optimal trees. Variants of the method use standard genetic algorithms with a defined objective function to swap high-scoring subtrees into main trees that are high-scoring overall.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

People having treatment outside this recommendation may continue without change to the funding arrangements in place for them before this guidance was published, until they and their NHS clinician consider it appropriate to stop.\nWhy the committee made these recommendations\nTreatment options for relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma are limited and there is no standard care. After 2 previous therapies, treatment may include rituximab plus lenalidomide or rituximab plus chemotherapy.\nClinical evidence suggests that follicular lymphoma responds to treatment with mosunetuzumab, so the cancer may not get worse as quickly. But these results are from a trial that did not compare mosunetuzumab with placebo or any other treatment options. Indirect comparisons of mosunetuzumab with other treatment options are very uncertain with inconsistent results.\nThe cost-effectiveness estimates for mosunetuzumab are highly uncertain and do not represent a cost-effective use of NHS resources. So, mosunetuzumab is not recommended for routine use in the NHS.\nMosunetuzumab cannot be recommended with managed access. This is because mosunetuzumab is not likely to be cost effective. Also, more data collected in the Cancer Drugs Fund would not resolve the high level of uncertainty.# Information about mosunetuzumab\n\n【3】 # Marketing authorisation indication\nMosunetuzumab (Lunsumio, Roche) is indicated for 'the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL) who have received at least two prior systemic therapies'.\n\n【4】 # Dosage in the marketing authorisation\nThe dosage schedule is available in the summary of product characteristics for mosunetuzumab.\n\n【5】 Mosunetuzumab costs £220 per 1 mg/1 ml concentrate for solution for infusion vial and £6,600 per 30 mg/30 ml concentrate for solution for infusion vial (excluding VAT; company submission). The cost per course of treatment is £66,660 for 8 cycles and £126,600 for 17 cycles.\nThe company has a commercial arrangement, which would have applied if mosunetuzumab had been recommended.# Committee discussion\n the committee papers for full details of the evidence.\n\n【6】 # The condition and current treatment\n\n【7】 ## Unmet need\nFollicular lymphoma is a type of indolent, low-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The patient expert noted that it is an incurable cancer that will return and people with the condition will need subsequent treatment for life. They explained that there is always the fear of relapse when living with the disease. Clinical experts noted that survival and remission duration worsen with each successive relapse. They explained that there is no current standard care and a lack of treatment options. This creates difficult treatment choices from a mixed basket of options for relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma. The clinical experts explained that when selecting treatment, factors such as a person's age, frailty and wishes are considered. The patient expert noted that people value alternatives to chemotherapy. Stakeholders commented on the draft guidance that mosunetuzumab could provide an extra line of treatment. The committee concluded that new treatment options would be welcomed by patients and clinicians.\n\n【8】 ## Current treatment\nClinical experts noted that in previously treated follicular lymphoma, treatment options inclu\nlenalidomide with rituximab  NICE technology appraisal guidance on lenalidomide with rituximab for previously treated follicular lymphoma)\n-binutuzumab with bendamustine  NICE technology appraisal guidance on obinutuzumab with bendamustine for treating follicular lymphoma after rituximab) and\nrituximab plus chemotherapy followed by rituximab maintenance therapy. They explained that for rituximab plus chemotherapy, people are likely to have rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone (R‑CHOP), rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisolone (R‑CVP) or rituximab plus bendamustine. Clinical experts noted that after first-line treatment, R‑CHOP and R‑CVP may be favoured over rituximab plus bendamustine. This is because rituximab plus bendamustine can be associated with greater toxicity. They noted that people aged over 70 do not tolerate bendamustine well. The committee noted that older people in mutual carer relationships would benefit from a non-chemotherapy treatment. Clinical experts explained that because of the long natural history of follicular lymphoma, some people have had potentially less effective treatments such as rituximab plus chemotherapy at second line. Others have had newer options such as rituximab plus lenalidomide or obinutuzumab plus bendamustine. So, the treatment landscape is complicated and changing. The experts noted that at third line and beyond, treatment choice will be influenced by previous therapy. This means people will have either rituximab plus lenalidomide if they have not had it before, or rituximab plus chemotherapy if they previously had rituximab plus lenalidomide. Rituximab plus chemotherapy may include rituximab plus bendamustine if a person is well enough and has not already had it. The NHS England Cancer Drugs Fund clinical lead noted that across second- and third-line treatment, more people currently have rituximab plus bendamustine than rituximab plus lenalidomide in NHS practice. The committee noted that obinutuzumab plus bendamustine is rarely used third line, so it is not a relevant comparator for this appraisal. The committee concluded that treatments used at third line or later are rituximab plus lenalidomide and rituximab plus chemotherapy, which may include rituximab plus bendamustine.\n\n【9】 # Clinical evidence\n\n【10】 ## Study population and generalisability\nGO29781 was a phase 2, multicentre, single-arm, non-comparative study in people with relapsed or refractory haematologic malignancies expected to express the CD20 antigen. Clinical evidence for mosunetuzumab is from a pivotal cohort of 90 people with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma who have had at least 2 previous therapies that included both an anti‑CD20 inhibitor and an alkylating agent. Patients had a median age of 60. The company noted that its clinical advisers considered the study population broadly representative of people who have had 2 or more previous treatments for follicular lymphoma in UK clinical practice, in terms of age (UK median age around , daily functioning, disease stage and prognosis. The EAG noted that only 2% of people in the study were from the UK and most were from the US (44%). Clinical experts confirmed that the study population broadly reflects UK clinical practice. They noted that the study population had a higher proportion of people with factors known to be associated with poorer outcomes for follicular lymphoma that is treated at third line or later. More than 50% of people in the study had cancer that was refractory to both an anti‑CD20 inhibitor and an alkylating agent. Also, more than 50% had disease progression within 24 months after the first systemic therapy. The committee concluded that the study population included people with a poor prognosis and was broadly generalisable to UK clinical practice.\n\n【11】 ## Outcomes and results\nThe primary efficacy endpoint in the GO29781 pivotal cohort was complete response as assessed by an independent review facility. In the primary analysis (March , 58% of people who had mosunetuzumab had a complete response. This was statistically significantly higher than a historical control complete response rate of 14% in a similar patient population. After a median follow up of 18 months (August , 60% of people who had mosunetuzumab had a complete tumour response. Median progression-free survival with mosunetuzumab was 17.9 months. Median overall survival was not reached. Clinical experts stated that the complete response rate seen with mosunetuzumab was very encouraging. The committee noted that it would have liked to have seen results from a phase 3 trial of mosunetuzumab compared with standard care treatments. The lack of any comparative data makes it difficult to interpret the trial results. The company explained that a phase 3 trial was planned with idelalisib as the comparator, but this did not go ahead because of emerging safety findings for the comparator drug class. The committee noted that the most common adverse event in the single-arm study of mosunetuzumab was cytokine release syndrome, which was seen in more than 40% of people. However, more than 95% of people with cytokine release syndrome had less severe events (grade 1 or . The company noted that cytokine release syndrome usually happened in the first treatment cycle on day 15 when the dose level was being increased. They added that it could be effectively managed with good clinical awareness and preventative treatment when starting mosunetuzumab. Clinical experts noted that mosunetuzumab was well tolerated after 1 month. It was not associated with lingering effects that would be seen with chemotherapy, and the need for treatment every 3 weeks after the first cycle of mosunetuzumab was manageable. The experts explained that mosunetuzumab could be administered in non-specialist centres if staff are trained to identify and manage cytokine release syndrome. The committee concluded that mosunetuzumab was potentially a promising new treatment option in relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma.\n\n【12】 # Indirect treatment comparisons\n\n【13】 ## Comparators\n concluded that rituximab plus bendamustine is a reasonable comparator, but whether it is representative of other types of rituximab plus chemotherapy is highly uncertain.\n\n【14】 ## Comparison with rituximab plus lenalidomide\n stated that stem cell transplant is increasingly uncommon in this population so is less relevant. The EAG noted that having several unmatched variables in the MAIC leads to high uncertainty in the results and the potential for bias, with the amount and direction of bias unclear. It added that the selection of covariates in the analysis had failed to maximise the effective sample size available to represent the efficacy of mosunetuzumab. The committee concluded that the indirect comparison of mosunetuzumab with rituximab plus lenalidomide was not matched for some important variables, making it highly uncertain with a potential for bias.\n\n【15】 ## Comparison with rituximab plus bendamustine\nFor the comparison of mosunetuzumab with rituximab plus bendamustine, the company used the CONTRALTO and GO29365 studies of rituximab plus bendamustine, which had individual patient data. Therefore, propensity score analyses were done. In these, an estimate of treatment effect is calculated after accounting for differences in covariates believed to be prognostic factors or treatment-effect modifiers across the treatment groups. The company explored several approaches and after technical engagement selected an inverse probability of treatment weighting method. In this, subjects are weighted by the inverse probability of treatment. This is done to balance the baseline characteristics between individuals in 2 separate studies and remove confounding. The company explained that the selection of variables in the analysis was based on improving the overall balance of these. The EAG noted that generally the important prognostic factors and effect modifiers were included in the analysis. It suggested that it was unclear whether double-refractory status should have been included in the analysis because it had wide standard errors making it unreliable. It noted that when the interaction of double-refractory status with treatment arm was included, there was an impact in the mosunetuzumab arm but a neutral effect in the rituximab plus bendamustine arm. The clinical plausibility of this is unclear. The committee concluded that there was some uncertainty associated with the indirect comparison of mosunetuzumab with rituximab plus bendamustine.\n\n【16】 ## Results of indirect treatment comparisons\n concluded that the inconsistencies within them made them very unreliable.\n\n【17】 # Economic model\n\n【18】 ## Company's modelling approach\n concluded that an alternative approach could help inform decision making in the comparison of mosunetuzumab with rituximab plus lenalidomide.\n\n【19】 ## Survival distributions selected\n be representative of other types of rituximab plus chemotherapy  section 3.. The company and EAG selected a log normal distribution for both the mosunetuzumab and rituximab plus bendamustine arms. The company and EAG agreed on using an exponential distribution to model overall survival in the mosunetuzumab and rituximab plus bendamustine arms. The committee concluded that the company and EAG agreed on most survival distributions and all would be considered.\n\n【20】 ## Overall survival modelling\n noted that pooling overall survival data had a substantial impact on the cost-effectiveness estimate for mosunetuzumab compared with rituximab plus bendamustine. The committee noted that the EAG's approach assumed that both treatments have the same overall survival, whereas the clinical experts expected people to live longer with mosunetuzumab. The company and EAG took different approaches to model survival for the 2 comparisons, and the EAG preferred to pool overall survival. The committee concluded that it would consider both approaches.\n\n【21】 ## Plausibility of the company's survival modelling\n concluded that the EAG scenarios could be plausible even though they are conservative.\n\n【22】 ## Utility values\n noted that it was not known whether the utility value for post-progression from the Wild abstract represented people on subsequent treatment or not. The EAG noted that Wild data has a much larger difference in utility value between the progression-free and post-progression states than the GO29781 study cohort. It noted that both potential sources have limitations. So, the EAG preferred not to change the utility values in its base case, which are from the GO29781 study cohort. The committee considered that the company and EAG took different approaches and both were associated with some uncertainty. It concluded that it preferred the GO29781 study cohort values because they were from a clinical study of people having mosunetuzumab, while Wild may not be a robust source and could not be validated.\n\n【23】 ## Subsequent therapy assumptions\nThe company's model applied subsequent treatment costs from the point of disease progression for all treatment arms. The EAG noted that this reflected what might happen in clinical practice. It added that this approach produced a bias towards lower costs in favour of mosunetuzumab. This is because progression-free survival and time on treatment is assumed to be equal for the comparators, but not for mosunetuzumab. After the first committee meeting, the company and EAG agreed on the distribution of subsequent treatments. These included rituximab plus lenalidomide (35%), rituximab plus chemotherapy (25%) and other non-rituximab-based chemotherapy (10%) for the mosunetuzumab and rituximab plus bedamustine treatment arms. In the rituximab plus lenalidomide arm it was assumed that people would not have rituximab plus lenalidomide as their subsequent therapy. So, in this arm subsequent treatment types included rituximab plus chemotherapy (50%) and other non-rituximab-based chemotherapy (20%). The committee noted that the subsequent therapy assumptions were informed by clinical advice. The EAG noted that it was possible that some people would have previous treatment with rituximab plus lenalidomide but not have it as their most recent previous therapy. This was not accounted for in the EAG's and company's updated base cases. The committee concluded that the company's subsequent treatment assumptions are likely to reflect clinical practice.\n\n【24】 # Cost-effectiveness estimates\n\n【25】 ## Company and EAG cost-effectiveness estimates\n noted that in the EAG's preferred model, life-years gained were the same for mosunetuzumab and rituximab plus lenalidomide. For the comparison with rituximab plus bendamustine, the mosunetuzumab ICER was above £30,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained in the company's updated base case and substantially higher than £30,000 per QALY gained in the EAG base case. In a scenario analysis, the EAG explored the impact on its preferred base case of changing the utility values  section 3. for the comparison of mosunetuzumab and rituximab plus bendamustine. The committee noted that using the utility values from Wild reduced the cost-effectiveness estimate of the EAG's preferred base case by a large amount, but the ICER remained substantially above £30,000 per QALY gained. The committee noted that for both comparisons the ICERs for the EAG base cases do not include any potential overall survival benefit for mosunetuzumab, which may be plausible but conservative  section 3.. The committee concluded that, based on the ICERs presented, mosunetuzumab does not represent a cost-effective use of NHS resources.\n\n【26】 ## Cost-effective estimates are highly uncertain\nNICE's guide to the methods of technology appraisal notes that above a most plausible ICER of £20,000 per QALY gained, judgements about the acceptability of a technology as an effective use of NHS resources will specifically consider the degree of certainty and uncertainty around the ICER. The committee will be more cautious about recommending a technology if it is less certain about the ICERs presented. The committee noted the high level of uncertainty in the cost-effectiveness estimate caused by:\na single-arm trial being the primary source of clinical evidence for mosunetuzumab  sections 3.3 and 3.\nissues with the indirect treatment comparisons including the comparators and the representativeness of rituximab plus bendamustine for other types of rituximab plus chemotherapy  section 3., variables included  sections 3.6 and 3., differences between the study populations included and the reliability and plausibility of the results  section 3.\nimmaturity and sparsity of efficacy estimates included in the model  section 3.\nlimitations in the data used to inform the utility values  section 3..The committee concluded that the cost-effectiveness estimates are highly uncertain.\n\n【27】 ## Mosunetuzumab is not cost effective\n associated with considerable uncertainty. The committee concluded that mosunetuzumab did not represent a cost-effective use of NHS resources so could not be recommended for routine commissioning.\n\n【28】 # Managed access\n\n【29】 ## Criteria for managed access not met\n noted that comparator studies cannot form part of a managed access agreement. The company confirmed that there are no ongoing comparative trials to provide more robust, controlled evidence on mosunetuzumab monotherapy at third line or later for relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma. The committee highlighted that, because the indirect treatment comparisons were highly uncertain, a trial comparing mosunetuzumab with standard care comparators is needed. The committee appreciated that managed access is designed to resolve uncertainties, but it did not think that it would sufficiently resolve the high level of uncertainty in this submission  section 3.. Also, it had not seen evidence that mosunetuzumab had plausible potential to be cost effective, because the company and EAG base cases were both greater than £30,000 per QALY gained  section 3.. The committee concluded that mosunetuzumab did not meet the criteria to be considered for a recommendation with managed access.\n\n【30】 # Other factors\n\n【31】 ## Potential equality issue\n noted that its recommendation applies to all people within the marketing authorisation indication for mosunetuzumab  section 2.. The committee concluded that this is not an equality issue.\nNICE's advice about conditions with a high degree of severity did not apply.\n\n【32】 ## Innovation\nThe committee noted that mosunetuzumab is the first of a new class of drugs in this setting with a unique mode of action. New treatment options would be welcomed by patients and clinicians  section 3. in an area where there is no current standard care  section 3.. Clinical experts advised that mosunetuzumab can be used after multiple previous treatments and in chemotherapy-resistant relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma. The committee considered whether mosunetuzumab was innovative. It recalled that the economic modelling of mosunetuzumab was highly uncertain. Because of this, it was possible that there were some benefits of mosunetuzumab not captured in the modelling. So, it concluded that mosunetuzumab may be innovative but there is a high level of uncertainty in the evidence presented. It would like to consider innovation together with the exploration of other uncertainties in the model, along with evidence of any uncaptured benefits.\n\n【33】 # Conclusion\nMosunetuzumab is not recommended for treating relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma after 2 or more systemic therapies.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

It covers identifying changing needs, planning for the future, and delivering services including health, social care and housing. It aims to support people to access the services they need as they get older.\n\n【2】 # Context\n face specific challenges associated with their learning disability. Many people with learning disabilities, especially those with milder disability, are not known to health or social services  People with learning disabilities in England 2013. Public Health England , whereas others may find it difficult to express their needs and be heard. Management of their needs will therefore be more complex than for other populations. This will create substantial pressure on services, which has not yet been fully quantified.\n have poorer health resulting from lifestyle issues such as diet and exercise for which they have not received enough advice and support.\n face barriers to accessing healthcare, including health and dental checks. The Michael report on Healthcare for all: independent inquiry into access to healthcare for people with learning disabilities  and the subsequent Confidential inquiry into premature deaths of people with learning disabilities  identified a failure of services to take account of the needs of people with learning disabilities and make reasonable adjustments. This led to misdiagnosis and, in some instances, premature death. People with learning disabilities may have an increased risk of mortality from conditions associated with their learning disability (for example, epilepsy and aspiration pneumonia). Such conditions are often diagnosed late in the course of illness.\n a barrier to accessing services.\n have particular housing and social support needs. Two‑thirds of adults with learning disabilities live with their families, usually their parents. In some instances, they may be caring for an older frail parent while they too are getting older. Eventually, ageing family carers may reluctantly explore alternative care arrangements when they are no longer able to provide long-term care. More serious is when family care ends through parental illness or death and, due to lack of future planning, the person may be moved inappropriately, or have multiple moves.\nFor people living in homes designed for adults with learning disabilities, these may be considered unsuifor them as they age, which can lead to a move. Older people with learning disabilities are thus likely to be placed in older people's residential services at a much younger age than the general population, even though this may not meet their preferences or needs, especially in relation to communication, support and activities.\nThe purpose of this guideline is to help commissioners and providers identify, plan and provide for the care and support needs of people growing older with learning disabilities and their families and carers. It covers integrated commissioning and planning; service delivery and organisation; providing accessible information, advice and support; identifying and assessing people's changing needs; care planning; and supporting access to services including health, social care, housing and end of life care. It aims to ensure that people with learning disabilities are given the help they need to access a range of services as they grow older so they can live healthy and fulfilled lives.\n covers day services, residential and nursing homes, and primary and secondary healthcare.\nA specific age limit is not used in this guideline because adults with learning disabilities typically experience age-related difficulties at different ages, and at a younger age, than the general population. The guideline does not cover people on the autistic spectrum who do not have a learning disability.\nThis guideline complements statutory duties and good practice as set out in relevant legislation and guidance. The recommendations cross-refer to legislation and other guidance where appropriate. Relevant legislation and guidance includes:\nCare Act 2014 and associated guidance\nEquality Act 2010\nMental Capacity Act 2005 (amended  and associated guidance on Deprivation of liberty safeguards\nMental Health Act 2007.\nSafeguarding is the responsibility of all practitioners. Practitioners must be familiar with, and follow, their local safeguarding procedures.# Recommendations\nPeople have the right to be involved in discussions and make informed decisions about their care, as described in your care.\nMaking decisions using NICE guidelines explains how we use words to show the strength (or certainty) of our recommendations, and has information about professional guidelines, standards and laws (including on consent and mental capacity), and safeguarding.\n\n【3】 # Overarching principles\n\n【4】 ## Access to services and person-centred care\nEnsure that people growing older with learning disabilities have the same access to care and support as everyone else. In line with the Equality Act 2010, this must be based on their needs and irrespective of:\nage\ndisability\ngender reassignment\nmarriage and civil partnership\npregnancy and maternity\nrace, religion and belief\nsex and sexual orientation\nsocioeconomic status\n-ther aspects of their identity.\nEnsure that care and support for people with learning disabilities is tailored to their needs, strengths and preferences and is not determined solely by their age or learning disability.\nService providers and commissioners must make reasonable adjustments to health, social care and housing services to ensure they are fully accessible to older people with learning disabilities and their family members and carers, in line with the Equality Act 2010.\nRecognise that people with learning disabilities may be carers, but may not see themselves as such. Ask the person if they have caring responsibilities and, if so, offer them a carer's assessment to meet their needs  NICE's guideline on supporting adult carers).\n\n【5】 ## Communicating and making information accessible\n inclu\nking advice from, or referring people to, a speech and language therapist whenever needed.\nProviding an independent interpreter (that is, someone who does not have a relationship with the person) so that people can communicate in their first language.\nFinding out before an appointment how the person prefers to communicate and receive information.\nExtending appointment times to give more time for discussion.\nGiving people written information (such as appointment letters and reminders) in different languages or in an accessible format of their choice, for example Easy Read, audio books, films or by using online resources such as specialist learning disability websites.\nProviding information on advocacy services and, if the person needs it and consents to it, providing an independent advocate who will attend appointments.\nUsing visual aids and short, clear sentences during consultations and conversations.\nTalking to the person's family members and carers if appropriate, and with the person's consent.\nProvide people with learning disabilities and their family members, carers and advocates with accessible, tailored information about:\nthe range and role of different health services (such as health checks and screening)\nhow to access health, social care and support services\nthe community and specialist services that are available, and their purpose\nhousing options that they could think about for the future\nplanning for end of life care\nfinancial issues, including wills, trusts and benefits\nhow to raise a safeguarding concern if they have one.\nSocial care and primary care practitioners should regularly review the communication needs of people with learning disabilities as they grow older to find out if they have changed. This should usually be when:\n-ther needs are being assessed, for example, during general health and dental checks\nthere is reason to believe their communication needs may have changed.\n\n【6】 ## Decision-making, mental capacity and consent\nHealth and social care practitioners must understand and take into account the Mental Capacity Act 2005 when working with people with learning disabilities, including:\nassuming the person has the mental capacity to take part in decision-making unless it is established that they lack capacity\nsupporting people to make decisions – finding out their views, encouraging them to take part in the decision-making process and ensuring all steps have been taken to help them express their views and make their own decisions\nassessing their capacity to make decisions – this assessment should take place where and with whom the person wishes\nundertaking best interests decision-making when it is established that a person does not have capacity to make a decision. (NICE's guideline on decision-making and mental capacity covers supporting people to make decisions, assessing mental capacity and best interests decision-making.)\n\n【7】 ## Involving people, family members, carers and advocates\nHealth and social care practitioners should listen to, actively involve and value key members of the person's support network in the planning and delivery of their current and future care and support, if the person agrees to this. Regularly check people's willingness and ability to be involved in this way.\nAsk people who they want to involve in planning and providing their support, regardless of whether they have close family. Be aware that some people do not have close family members, friends or carers.\nOffer independent advocacy whenever it is wanted or needed by a person with a learning disability. As a minimum, it must be offered as described in the Care Act 2014, Mental Capacity Act 2005 and Mental Health Act 2007.\nFind out and prioritise the needs and preferences of the person. Ensure these are not overshadowed by the decisions or preferences of others, including when the person lacks capacity.\nBe aware that people with learning disabilities may need support to communicate their needs or retain information. With the person's consent, share information with their family members, carers or advocate, for example about:\nany changes that might be needed to their care and support\nsymptoms, management and prognosis of the person's health conditions.\n\n【8】 # Organising and delivering care and support\n\n【9】 ## Planning and commissioning local services\nHealth and social care commissioners should have an understanding of the needs of people growing older with learning disabilities in their area and know what mainstream and specialist services are available locally to support people as they grow older.\nCommissioners should identify the number of adults in their area with a learning disability (and the number of families and carers), and use this information to identify gaps in provision, organise services and plan future provision. This could be done by encouraging GPs to develop and maintain registers of people with learning disabilities and getting information from other support services, including education and the Department for Work and Pensions.\nCommissioners and service providers should ensure family members, carers and advocates of people with learning disabilities have access to age-appropriate community support services and resources such as:\nday opportunities\nshort respite breaks (both at home and away from home)\nfamily placements\nsupport groups for family carers, including siblings, and for older people with learning disabilities who have caring responsibilities\na single point of contact for practical information, emotional support and signposting.\nCommissioners and service providers should provide housing options that meet the changing needs of people with learning disabilities as they grow older. This includes:\nmaking reasonable adjustments to support people to stay in their current housing as their physical and emotional needs change, for example providing equipment or housing adaptations\narranging housing for people with learning disabilities who are in unshousing situations, for example those who are homeless or in temporary accommodation (including people seeking asylum)\nsupported living\nresidential and nursing care, which reflect gender, sexual orientation and cultural preferences.\nCommissioners should make available locally a wide range of family and community support options to meet the needs of people with learning disabilities as they grow older, including the needs of people in later old age, and their family members and carers. These might inclu\nensuring accessible transport links are available to help people access local facilities\naccess to advocacy services.\nConsider the use of technologies such as telehealth and telecare to complement but not replace the support provided by people face to face.\nCommissioners should identify where there are gaps in community optometry, audiology and dental services for people with learning disabilities and address those gaps.\nMental health commissioners should develop protocols to ensure that people with learning disabilities, including people in later old age, have access to mainstream mental health services for older people, including dementia support.\nCommissioners and service providers should ensure that people with learning disabilities have equal access to a range of community services that reflect the cultural diversity of the local area and people's hopes, preferences, choices and abilities as they grow older.\nCommissioners and service providers should establish links between specialist learning disability services and mainstream older people's services. This could be done by bringing them together to help identify gaps and inform service development, sharing information and learning, and linking into voluntary sector umbrella groups.\nCommissioners and service providers should provide opportunities for people with learning disabilities to meet up and socialise, for instance through social clubs and support groups.\nCommissioners and service providers should ensure there is a wide range of community-based physical activity programmes available and encourage people to take part to promote their health and wellbeing. Examples include dancing, swimming, bowls, using the gym, organised walks and chair-based exercise classes.\nCommissioners and service providers should arrange accessible opportunities for people with learning disabilities to engage in education, employment and volunteering.\nLocal authorities should consider introducing schemes to make transport easier for older people with learning disabilities. For example:\nproviding free travel such as London's 'Freedom pass'\nusing minibuses as community transport\nstarting 'buddy' schemes to enable independent travel\ndeveloping transport especially for people living in rural locations\nschemes such as 'JAM' cards (Just A Minute) – which can be used to alert transport staff that people have a learning disability\nschemes to help people with a personal budget to travel to activities and self-advocacy groups.\n\n【10】 # Identifying and assessing care and support needs\n\n【11】 ## Assessing people's need for care and support\nEnsure that all assessments of care and support needs are strengths based, person centred and conducted as early as possible. Follow the recommendations on care and support needs assessment in NICE's guideline on people's experience in adult social care services.\nPractitioners carrying out assessments of care and support needs should have:\naccess to the person's full history (medical, social, psychological and the nature of their learning disability) and\nan understanding of their usual behaviour.\nPractitioners carrying out assessments of care and support needs should be alert to any changes in the person's usual behaviour. This could include how they are communicating or their activity levels, and symptoms (such as weight loss, changes in sleeping patterns or low mood) that could show something is wrong or they are unwell.\nBe aware that people growing older with learning disabilities might have difficulty communicating their health needs. When their needs change, think about whether these changes could be age-related and do not assume they are due to the person's learning disability or pre-existing condition (diagnostic overshadowing).\nPractitioners carrying out assessments of care and support needs should help people to think about what they want from life as they age. This should inclu\nasking people how they would like to spend their time and with whom, and enabling them to explore personal and sexual relationships\nencouraging them to develop support networks and to build and maintain links with friends and family and with community groups – these might include social, cultural and faith-based groups.\n\n【12】 ## Assessing the needs of family members and carers\nPractitioners carrying out assessments of care and support needs should take into account the needs, capabilities and wishes of families and carers. Also take into account that there may be mutual caring between people with learning disabilities, and their family members and carers, who are likely to be older themselves and have their own support needs.\nPractitioners must offer people who are caring for a person with a learning disability their own carer's assessment, in line with the Care Act 2014.\nBased on assessment, provide families and carers with support that meets their needs as carers  NICE's guideline on supporting adult carers).\nReview the needs and circumstances of carers at least once a year and if something significant changes  NICE's guideline on supporting adult carers).\nActively encourage carers to register themselves as a carer, for example, with their GP.\n\n【13】 # Planning and reviewing care and support\n\n【14】 ## Person-centred planning and review\nPractitioners should carry out regular person-centred planning with people growing older with learning disabilities to address their changing needs, wishes and capabilities and promote their independence. This should include planning for the future  recommendations 1.4.5 to 1.4.. Involve their family members, carers and advocates as appropriate.\nInclude transport needs in people's care and support plans, to help them get to services, appointments and activities.\nLocal authorities should plan people's care and support in a way that meets the needs of all family members, as well as the person themselves. This might include combining the personal budgets of different family members.\nGive help and information to families and carers, including siblings, as part of planning and providing support for people growing older with learning disabilities. For example, tell them about sources of support for people after a family bereavement.\n\n【15】 ## Planning for the future\nHealth and social care practitioners should work with the person and those most involved in their support to agree a plan for the future. Help them to make decisions before a crisis point or life-changing event is reached (for example, the death of a parent or a move to new housing).\nPlanning for the future should:\nbe proactive\nbe led by the person themselves with input from family members, carers or advocates as appropriate (regardless of whether they provide care and support themselves)\ninvolve a practitioner who has a good relationship with the person and communicates well with them\ninvolve practitioners who have good knowledge of local resources\ntake into account the whole of the person's life, including their hopes and dreams as well as the things they do not want to happen\ninclude considering the needs of family members and carers\nseek to maintain the person's current support and housing arrangements, if this is their preference\nbe reviewed every year and whenever the person's needs or circumstances change.\nInclude as key components of a future plan:\nHousing needs and potential solutions.\nAny home adaptations or technology that may address people's changing needs as they grow older.\nMembers of the person's support network (both paid and unpaid).\nAny help the person gives to family members, whether this will continue as they age, and the impact this may have on their health and wellbeing.\nPlanning for what will happen if someone who the person relies on dies, or is no longer able to provide care and support.\nFinancial and legal issues, for example whether someone has been appointed to have lasting power of attorney for the person.\nThe provision of information on wills, trusts and benefits.\nPlanning for unexpected changes or emergencies.\nPlanning for a time when the person may lack capacity to make decisions themselves, in line with the Mental Capacity Act 2005.\nConsideration of deprivation of liberty safeguards, for instance if planned changes to care or the care environment are likely to increase restrictions on the person.\nEnd of life care decisions – including where the person wants to be when they die. These decisions should be reviewed at least once a year.\nWhen helping the person plan where they will live in the future and who they will live with, take into account whether other family members rely on them for support.\nEncourage and support people to be active and independent at home regardless of their age or learning disability. This might include doing household tasks, making their own decisions and plans or leading group activities.\nMake reasonable adjustments to people's homes as they grow older to make it possible for them to stay in their current home if they want to. For example, consider a support phone line, daily living equipment, telehealth monitoring and home adaptations, such as shower room conversion, wider doorways or a lift between floors.\nReview at least once a year the housing needs of people who are being supported by social care staff at home.\nEnsure that the person is centrally involved in any decisions about moving from where they currently live. Also include an advocate or, if appropriate, a family member or carer.\nIf a move is agreed with the person, practitioners should work with them and their support network to start planning for this straightaway. Planning could inclu\narranging for the person to visit the new setting\ndiscussing how they will maintain their existing support networks and develop new ones.\n\n【16】 # Identifying and managing health needs\nHealthcare practitioners should encourage people growing older with learning disabilities to choose a family member, carer or advocate to bring with them to medical examinations and appointments if they would like this support.\nExplain clearly to people with learning disabilities what will happen during any medical appointments as well as their likely follow‑up care. In line with the Mental Capacity Act 2005, healthcare practitioners must take all reasonable steps to help the person understand this explanation.\n explain to their family member, carer or advocate what will happen.\nIf the person needs a medical examination, give them a choice, wherever possible, about where it takes place. Aim to do it in a place that is familiar to them, which is welcoming and appropriate to their needs.\nSupport family members and carers, for example by providing information, so that they can help people with learning disabilities to access health services.\nConsider commissioning training for people and their family members and carers in recognising changes and managing age-related conditions such as:\nblood pressure and cholesterol\ncancer\nchanges to skin condition such as itchy or fragile skin\ndementia\ndiabetes\ndysphagia (difficulty swallowing)\nepilepsy\nhearing loss and sight problems\nincontinence\n-steoporosis\nmalnutrition\nmenopausal symptoms\nmental health, including depression\nthyroid problems.\n\n【17】 ## Coordinating care and sharing information\nManagers in healthcare settings should identify a single lead practitioner to be the point of contact for people with learning disabilities and their family members, carers and advocates. This practitioner could be a member of the community learning disability team or a nurse with experience in learning disabilities.\nEnsure that everyone involved in the person's care and support shares information and communicates regularly about the person's health and any treatment they are having, for example by holding regular multidisciplinary meetings. Involve the person in all discussions.\nPrimary and secondary healthcare teams should identify at least 1 member of staff who develops specific knowledge and skills in working with people with learning disabilities and acts as a champion, modelling and sharing good practice. Use the expertise of people with learning disabilities to ensure the champion understands their needs.\nRecord a person's learning disability and any reasonable adjustments in their health records and share this information when making referrals. With the person's consent, make sure all relevant practitioners in community and acute settings can access this. Also record any specific needs or wishes, for example to do with the person's communication or mobility.\n\n【18】 ## Health checks and screening\nRecognise that people with learning disabilities may need additional health surveillance to help them identify and communicate symptoms of age-related conditions.\nOffer annual health checks to older people with learning disabilities as long as these are followed by prompt referral to specialist services wherever needed. Explain what annual health checks involve and how to arrange them. Record any actions identified by the annual health check in the person's health action plan.\nOffer older people with learning disabilities the same routine screening and health checks as other older people.\nDiscuss with people the changes that may occur with age. Ask them about and monitor them for symptoms of common age-related conditions or changes in any existing conditions, including:\nblood pressure and cholesterol\ncancer\n see recommendations 1.5.36 and 1.5..\ndiabetes\ndysphagia (difficulty swallowing)\nepilepsy\nhearing loss and sight problems\nincontinence\n-steoporosis\nmalnutrition\nmenopausal symptoms\nmental health, including depression\nthyroid problems.\nDuring a person's annual health check, give them information about other available services, including a care and support assessment under the Care Act 2014 if they have not already had one.\nDuring a person's annual health check, ask if they are registered with a dentist, how often they see the dentist and check that they understand the importance of looking after their teeth and mouth.\nGive people clear, accessible and practical information and advice about keeping well as they grow older. Tell them about, and help them access, services such as breast screening, smear tests, testicular and prostate checks, dental checks, hearing and sight tests, and podiatry.\nWhen designing and delivering breast screening services, address specific barriers to accessing breast screening among older women with learning disabilities, including support to:\nunderstand breast cancer\nunderstand the screening procedure\nbe breast aware and check their breasts regularly\nunderstand any information provided\nattend appointments.\n\n【19】 ## Primary care\nPrimary care and community services should aim to ensure that older people with learning disabilities can see the same GP and other healthcare practitioners, wherever possible, to help practitioners:\nbecome familiar with the person's medical history, which the person may have difficulty remembering themselves\nbuild good relationships and understand the person's usual behaviour and communication needs.\nGeneral practices should allocate a named member of staff to remind people with learning disabilities about appointments for screening and health examinations. This staff member should help the person attend the appointment by:\nusing each person's preferred method of communication\ngiving them information in a way they can understand\nensuring the person understands the reason for the appointment and why it is important\nfinding out their transport needs\nmaking reasonable adjustments to help the person and their carer or supporter to attend.\nIf the person is diagnosed with a health condition, give them and their family members, carers or advocate accessible information on the following (taking time to explain it to them as well):\nsymptoms and management\nbenefits, and potential side effects, of treatment\nhow to take their prescribed medicines.\nSupport people to manage their own health conditions by getting to know them and adapting health advice to suit their personal choices and the activities they already enjoy (for example, playing football).\n\n【20】 ## Dental care\nCommissioners and managers should ensure that support staff have knowledge of oral health so they can support people with learning disabilities to maintain good oral health and access dental services.\nDental practices should ensure their services are accessible to people with learning disabilities, for example by:\nreminding people about their appointments by phone\nsending letters in an accessible format, for example Easy Read\nsuggesting that the person brings a carer or supporter with them\nensuring staff have the skills to communicate with people with learning disabilities and put them at ease. For further guidance on managing oral health, see the NICE guidelines on:\n-ral health promotion: general dental practice\n-ral health for adults in care homes.\n\n【21】 ## Outpatient appointments\nHospitals should offer an opportunity for the person and a family member, carer or advocate to visit the hospital before their outpatient appointment to meet the staff who will conduct any tests or examinations, see the equipment that will be used and identify what adjustments will be needed.\n\n【22】 ## Before and during a hospital stay\nWhen planning a hospital admission, arrange a pre-admission planning meeting, including the hospital liaison team or liaison nurse, a representative of the community learning disability team, the person and their family members, carers or advocate. At this meeting:\ncomplete the pre-admission documentation, which should include information from the person's hospital passport\ndiscuss any reasonable adjustments needed, for example, arranging for the person to visit the hospital before their admission to meet the learning disability liaison nurse who will be their contact.\nHospitals should actively encourage staff to use pre-admission documents and flagging systems so that all relevant hospital staff know about the person's learning disability. At discharge, review how well this is working.\nHospitals should develop policies and guidance to enable someone chosen by the person to stay with them throughout their inpatient stay, including overnight.\nHospital staff should continue to offer health and personal care (toileting, washing, nutrition and hydration) to people with learning disabilities even if they have a family member, carer or advocate there to support them.\nFor further guidance on planning admission and admitting adults with identified social care needs to hospital, see NICE's guideline on transition between inpatient hospital settings and community or care home settings for adults with social care needs.\n\n【23】 ## Transfer of care from hospital\nIf the person agrees, invite family members, carers or advocates to pre-discharge meetings, as well as the person themselves.\nIf the discharge plan involves support from family members or carers, take into account their:\nwillingness and ability to provide support\ncircumstances, needs and aspirations\nrelationship with the person\nneed for respite (short breaks). \nGive the person (and their family members and carers) an accessible copy of their discharge plan when they are discharged, and make sure their GP has a copy within 24 hours. Make sure everyone knows what will happen next in the person's care and support. \nAfter the person is discharged, the hospital learning disability liaison nurse, community learning disability team and primary care practitioners should work together to provide ongoing support to help the person manage their health condition.\nFor further guidance on discharging adults with identified social care needs from hospital, see NICE's guideline on transition between inpatient hospital settings and community or care home settings for adults with social care needs.\n\n【24】 ## Dementia\nExplain at an early stage to people with learning disabilities (particularly people with Down's syndrome) and their family members, carers and advocates about the link between learning disabilities and dementia. Explain the signs of dementia, how it usually progresses and what support is available. Give people:\nprinted information on dementia\n-pportunities for one-to-one discussion with a professional\nadvice on communication strategies for people with dementia.\n providing training. Information and training might cover:\ntypes of dementia\nhow dementia might present in people with different learning disabilities\ncare pathways for different dementias\npractical steps to manage daily life\ncommunication skills\nhow to find further advice and ongoing support, including support groups and respite services (short breaks).\n\n【25】 # End of life care\n\n【26】 ## Access to end of life care services\nGive people growing older with learning disabilities and their family members, carers and advocates accessible, timely and person-centred information about all the potential care options available for end of life care, including hospice services.\n\n【27】 ## Making sure end of life care is person centred\nPractitioners providing end of life care should spend time getting to know the person to understand their needs. Get to know how they communicate, their cultural background, what they like and dislike, how they express pain, their health conditions and the medication they are taking. Be aware that this understanding will make it easier to identify when the person's health is deteriorating.\nIdentify who the person would like to involve in creating their end of life plan. Include the person themselves and everyone who supports them in discussions and planning.\nAsk the person regularly who they would like to involve in discussions about their end of life plan, in case they change their mind. Do this every 6 months, or more often if the person is close to the end of life.\nMake it possible for the person to die where they wish. This might include adapting their home, working with other practitioners and advocates, and talking to other residents or family members about changes that could be made (for example, moving the person to a room on the ground floor).\n\n【28】 ## Involving families and support networks\nDuring end of life care planning, talk to the person and their family members, carers or advocate to understand the person's wishes and any cultural needs at the end of their life.\nWhen providing end of life care, learn from family members, carers or advocates about the person's needs and wishes, including those associated with faith and culture, nutrition, hydration and pain management. This is particularly important if the person has difficulty communicating.\nLearning disability providers delivering care at the end of life should work collaboratively and share information with other practitioners and services involved in the person's daily life.\nSocial care providers should work in partnership with healthcare providers to share knowledge about the person and to develop expertise for end of life care.\nProvide training, information and support for family members and carers, for example, in medication, pain, nutrition and hydration, to enable the person to die where they wish.\nMake sure that key members of the person's support network have the knowledge, confidence and understanding to communicate with the person about their illness and death. This includes being able to talk to the person about symptoms, pain management and their preferences about resuscitation.\nMainstream end of life care services should make reasonable adjustments to support the person, their family members, friends and carers and other people they live with, throughout palliative and end of life care and bereavement.\nFor further guidance on end of life care, see NICE's guideline on care of dying adults in the last days of life.\n\n【29】 # Staff skills and expertise\nManagers in health and social care services should ensure that staff in older people's services have the expertise to support people growing older with learning disabilities from a wide range of backgrounds.\nManagers in health and social care services should ensure that learning disability staff have the skills and understanding to support people's changing needs as they grow older. Provide this skilled support in all settings, including people's own homes.\nManagers in health and social care services should ensure that all staff working with people with learning disabilities have skills and knowledge in:\ncommunication methods, including non-verbal communication\nbuilding good relationships with people with learning disabilities and making them feel at ease\nthe physical, mental health and sensory needs of older people with learning disabilities, related to both their age and disability\nthe application of the Mental Capacity Act 2005\nsafeguarding issues, including how to report concerns and keep people safe\ncommon health conditions to which people with learning disabilities are predisposed, for example, the earlier onset of dementia\nassessing people's changing needs as they grow older, and not assuming that any new problems are due to their learning disability when they could be symptoms of other conditions or difficulties (diagnostic overshadowing)\nthe main causes of early death in people with learning disabilities.\nManagers in health and social care services should provide opportunities for learning disability staff and practitioners working with older people to share expertise with each other as part of their knowledge and skills development.\nStaff should know what local services are available (including housing options) so they can support people with learning disabilities and their family members, carers and advocates to make informed choices about their care and support.\n\n【30】 ## Staff skills and expertise for supporting end of life care\nCommissioners and providers of end of life care should recognise the complex needs of people with learning disabilities. They should provide ongoing training for staff to ensure they have the expertise to provide good-quality coordinated care, enabling people to die in their own home or another place of their choice. Training should inclu\nhaving discussions about resuscitation intentions\nfinding out and responding to cultural preferences\nrecognising pain and discomfort\nmanaging symptoms, pain and medication\nnutrition and hydration\nunderstanding communication preferences and being able to communicate – this might include using augmentative and alternative communication methods.\nProvide in‑service training for learning disability and palliative care practitioners so they have the skills to support people at the end of life. This might include joint study days and training of professionals by people with learning disabilities and their family members and carers.\n\n【31】 # Terms used in this guideline\n\n【32】 ## Annual health check\nAn NHS initiative for adults and young people aged 14 and over with learning disabilities to provide additional health support and help to identify health conditions that could otherwise go undetected.\n\n【33】 ## Augmentative and alternative communication\nAn umbrella term that includes methods of communication to supplement or replace speech or writing for people who need support to understand or express language.\n\n【34】 ## Diagnostic overshadowing\nIn this guideline, this is used to mean the tendency to attribute all behavioural, emotional, physical and social issues to a person's learning disability or a pre-existing condition, while overlooking the possibility that they could be symptoms of other conditions or difficulties. An example would be attributing challenging behaviour to a learning disability when it could be a reaction to abdominal pain, which in turn might be symptomatic of a physical health problem.\n\n【35】 ## Family members and carers\nThis includes people who are related to the person with a learning disability and anyone else who helps to provide informal support, for example friends. It does not cover staff who are paid to provide care or support.\n\n【36】 ## Health action plan\nA personal plan for people with learning disabilities about how to stay healthy. It should detail what help and support they need to look after their health. This might include support to manage physical or mental health conditions, or actions in relation to lifestyle issues such as diet and exercise.\n\n【37】 ## Hospital passport\nA hospital passport is designed to give hospital staff useful information that is not limited to illness and health. For example, it could include details about what the person likes and dislikes in terms of physical contact or food and drink. The idea is to help hospital staff understand how to make the person feel comfor\n\n【38】 ## Lasting power of attorney\nLasting power of attorney is a legal document that lets someone appoint one or more people to make decisions on their behalf, should they be unable to. Lasting power of attorney can be made in relation to health and welfare, and property and financial affairs.\n\n【39】 ## People growing older with learning disabilities\nFor the purpose of this guideline, a learning disability is defined as meeting 3 core criteria:\nlower intellectual ability (usually an IQ of less than \nsignificant impairment of social or adaptive functioning\n-nset in childhood.\nA person's learning disability may be mild, moderate, severe or profound in severity. Learning disabilities are different from specific learning difficulties such as dyslexia, which do not affect intellectual ability.\nA specific age limit is not used to define older people because adults with learning disabilities typically experience age-related difficulties at different ages, and at a younger age than the general population. This is reflected in the guideline title 'people growing older with learning disabilities'. Within the recommendations, this long form is used at the beginning of each section but in subsequent recommendations 'people' or 'people with learning disabilities' is used as a short hand. In all cases, the intended population is 'people growing older with learning disabilities'.\n\n【40】 ## Practitioner\nIn this guideline, 'practitioner' is used to mean a health or social care practitioner who provides care and support for older people with learning disabilities.\n\n【41】 ## Support network\nAll the people who provide emotional and practical help to a person with a learning disability. A person's support network could include their family (including siblings), friends, carers, advocates, non-family members living with the person in supported housing, and members of the person's religious community.\nFor other social care terms, see the Think Local, Act Personal care and support jargon buster.# Putting this guideline into practice\nNICE has produced tools and resources to help you put this guideline into practice.\nSome issues were highlighted that might need specific thought when implementing the recommendations. These were raised during the development of this guideline. They are:\n mean challenging assumptions and looking beyond the person's learning disability to provide the support needed to help them live an active, community-involved life.\nEnsuring a well-trained and supported workforce, with the knowledge needed to support people growing older with learning disabilities. Health and social care services are structured in a way that tends to mean practitioners work in either learning disability or older people's services, and their training and support reflects this. Moving to a workforce with expertise from across both disciplines may be challenging to achieve.\nPlanning and commissioning local health, social care and housing services to meet the needs of the local population. Commissioners need to know the size of their local population of adults with learning disabilities, and any likely future growth in this population. Learning disability services are often seen as separate from other services, but all pathways of care and support need to consider the needs of people with learning disabilities in order to improve access and funding.\nPutting recommendations into practice can take time. How long may vary from guideline to guideline, and depends on how much change in practice or services is needed. Implementing change is most effective when aligned with local priorities.\nChanges should be implemented as soon as possible, unless there is a good reason for not doing so (for example, if it would be better value for money if a package of recommendations were all implemented at once).\nDifferent organisations may need different approaches to implementation, depending on their size and function. Sometimes individual practitioners may be able to respond to recommendations to improve their practice more quickly than large organisations.\nHere are some pointers to help organisations put NICE guidelines into practice:\n. Raise awareness through routine communication channels, such as email or newsletters, regular meetings, internal staff briefings and other communications with all relevant partner organisations. Identify things staff can include in their own practice straight away.\n. Identify a lead with an interest in the topic to champion the guideline and motivate others to support its use and make service changes, and to find out any significant issues locally.\n. Carry out a baseline assessment against the recommendations to find out whether there are gaps in current service provision.\n help identify local issues that will slow or prevent implementation.\n. Develop an action plan, with the steps needed to put the guideline into practice, and make sure it is ready as soon as possible. Big, complex changes may take longer to implement, but some may be quick and easy to do. An action plan will help in both cases.\n. For very big changes include milestones and a business case, which will set out additional costs, savings and possible areas for disinvestment. A small project group could develop the action plan. The group might include the guideline champion, a senior organisational sponsor, staff involved in the associated services, finance and information professionals.\n need project management support.\n. Review and monitor how well the guideline is being implemented through the project group. Share progress with those involved in making improvements, as well as relevant boards and local partners.\n our into practice pages for more information.\nAlso see Leng G, Moore V, Abraham S, editors  Achieving high quality care – practical experience from NICE. Chichester: Wiley.# Recommendations for research\nThe guideline committee has made the following recommendations for research. The full list of research recommendations is in the full guideline.\n\n【42】 # Models of care and support at home\nWhat is the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of care and support models (for example, assistive technology) for people growing older with learning disabilities to enable them to live in the family home?\n\n【43】 ## Why this is important\nThere is no evidence from studies published later than 2005 about the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of care and support models for people growing older with learning disabilities living in the family home, or about their experiences of that support. For example, we did not identify any evidence on the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of assistive technology for supporting older people with learning disabilities and their ageing family carers.\nComparative studies are needed to evaluate the costs and impact of different approaches, like assistive technology, on care and support for older people with learning disabilities in the family home. Resource use information, demonstrating the impact on paid and unpaid care (whether it increases or decreases as a result of the different support models) is needed as well as outcome data relating to families and carers. These should be supplemented by qualitative studies to explore the views and experiences of older people with learning disabilities, including those from minority backgrounds, and their families and carers, in relation to different models of support.\n\n【44】 # Identifying health conditions\nWhat is the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of different ways of identifying age-related and other physical and mental health conditions, in people growing older with learning disabilities?\nWhat can mainstream and specialist health services do to facilitate:\nearly identification of health conditions in people with learning disabilities?\nequal access to health services in people with learning disabilities?\n\n【45】 ## Why this is important\nApart from studies on annual health checks, we did not find any evidence about different methods and pathways for identifying health conditions among people growing older with learning disabilities. There is a need for effectiveness and cost-effectiveness studies using longitudinal, comparative designs to evaluate the costs and outcomes, in particular the final health outcomes, of different approaches to identifying health conditions in people with learning disabilities. These should be complemented by qualitative studies to explore the views and experiences of people with learning disabilities, including those from minority backgrounds, and their families, carers and practitioners, on the facilitators and barriers of these approaches. This includes their views on how, where and by whom these services should be provided.\n\n【46】 # Education and training programmes: self-management\nWhat is the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of education programmes to improve information and advice and to support self-management of chronic health conditions (for example, obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease) for people growing older with learning disabilities, and their family members and carers?\n\n【47】 ## Why this is important\n evidence that families and carers play a central role in supporting and advising people with learning disabilities about their health conditions and promoting healthier lifestyle choices.\nThere is currently a lack of information about the cost effectiveness of such education programmes. However, there is evidence that people with learning disabilities are more likely to have missed appointments with health professionals, do not have optimal medication management and have problems to access to healthcare more broadly, all of which can have costly consequences; some of those might be avoided or reduced through self-management.\nComparative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness studies are needed to evaluate the impact of education programmes to support self-management for people with learning disabilities. These need to be supplemented with studies exploring the views and experiences of people with learning disabilities, including those from minority backgrounds, and their families, carers and practitioners, on the accessibility and acceptability of different approaches to supporting self-management and communicating health messages.\n\n【48】 # Dementia education and training programmes for family members and carers\nWhat is the effectiveness, cost effectiveness and acceptability of training programmes (for example, in the use of life story work) for families of people growing older with learning disabilities who have dementia or are at risk of developing it?\n\n【49】 ## Why this is important\nNo evidence was found from studies published later than 2005 about the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of interventions or training programmes for family members and carers of people growing older with learning disabilities who have, or are at risk of developing dementia. There is some evidence that some family members and carers of people with learning disabilities and dementia need specialist training in dementia care.\nComparative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness studies are needed to evaluate the impact of specific interventions or training programmes for families and carers of people with learning disabilities, including for people living with conditions such as dementia. Qualitative studies are needed to explore the views and experiences of family, friends and carers of people with learning disabilities, including those from minority backgrounds, about these training programmes.\n\n【50】 # Advance planning about end of life care\nWhat is the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of advance care planning for end of life care for people growing older with learning disabilities, and their family members and carers?\nWhat processes are in place to document and follow the wishes of people growing older with learning disabilities about their decisions on end of life care?\n\n【51】 ## Why this is important\nWe identified no studies evaluating the effectiveness or cost effectiveness of advance care planning for end of life care in people growing older with learning disabilities, and their family members and carers. Such studies would help to determine how and what reasonable adjustments should be made to ensure that people with learning disabilities receive appropriate care at the end of life, and the costs and cost consequences associated with those. Longitudinal studies should have a naturalistic design with a control group to follow up families and carers who have used advance care planning for end of life care in people with learning disabilities.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

{"seq_id": "97f75a51-158b-49f5-87a9-f2067197ec4b", "title": null, "text": "【0】 This report provides updated information concerning the potential adverse events associated with vaccination for hepatitis B, poliomyelitis, measles, mumps, diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis. This information incorporates findings from a series of recent literature reviews, conducted by an expert committee at the Institute of Medicine (IOM), of all evidence regarding the possible adverse consequences of vaccines administered to children. This report contains modifications to the previously published recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and is based on an ACIP review of the IOM findings and new research on vaccine safety. In addition, this report incorporates information contained in the \"Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices: Use of Vaccines and Immune Globulins in Persons with Altered Immunocompetence\" (MMWR 1993; and the \"General Recommendations on Immunization: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)\" (MMWR  1994;. Major changes to the previous recommendations are highlighted within the text, and specific information concerning the following vaccines and the possible adverse events associated with their administration are included: hepatitis B vaccine and anaphylaxis; measles vaccine and a) thrombocytopenia and b) possible risk for death resulting from anaphylaxis or disseminated disease in immunocompromised persons; diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis vaccine (DTP) and chronic encephalopathy; and tetanus-toxoid-containing vaccines and a) Guillain-Barré syndrome, b) brachial neuritis, and c) possible risk for death resulting from anaphylaxis. These modifications will be incorporated into more comprehensive ACIP recommendations for each vaccine when such statements are revised. Also included in this report are interim recommendations concerning the use of measles and mumps vaccines in a) persons who are infected with human immunodeficiency virus and b) persons who are allergic to eggs; ACIP is still evaluating these recommendations. *In this publication, the terms \"side effects\" and \"adverse reactions\" are used interchangeably to denote the undesirable secondary effects resulting from vaccination.# INTRODUCTION\nImmunization has enabled the global eradication of smallpox (, the elimination of poliomyelitis from the Western hemisphere (, and major reductions in the incidence of other vaccine-prevendiseases in the United States . However, although immunization has successfully reduced the incidence of vaccine-prevendiseases, vaccination can cause both minor and, rarely, serious side effects. Public awareness of and controversy about vaccine safety has increased, primarily because increases in vaccine coverage resulted in an increased number of adverse events that occurred after vaccination. Such adverse events include both true reactions to vaccine and events coincidental to, but not caused by, vaccination. Despite concerns about vaccine safety, vaccination is safer than accepting the risks for the diseases these vaccines prevent. Unless a disease has been eradicated (e.g., smallpox), failure to vaccinate increases the risks to both the individual and society.\n mandated that the Institute of Medicine- (IOM) review scientific and other evidence regarding the possible adverse consequences of vaccines administered to children.\nIOM constituted an expert committee to review all available information on these vaccine adverse events; such information included epidemiologic studies, case series, individual case reports, and testimonials. To derive their conclusions, the IOM committee members created five categories of causality to describe the relationships between the vaccines and specific adverse events. The first IOM review examined certain events occurring after administration of pertussis and rubella vaccines  (. The second IOM review examined events occurring after administration of all other vaccines usually administered during childhood (i.e., diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and measles, mumps, hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenzae type b , and poliovirus vaccines)  (. Two other IOM committees have met since the findings of the second review were published. These two committees have published *An independent research organization chartered by the National Academy of Sciences.  (, an independent research organization chartered by the National Academy of Sciences. The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 mandated that IOM review scientific and other evidence (e.g., epidemiologic studies, case series, individual case reports, and testimonials) regarding the possible adverse consequences of vaccines administered to children. IOM constituted an expert committee to review and summarize all available information; this committee created five categories of causality to describe the relationships between the vaccines and specific adverse events.  IOM reviewed this adverse event again in 1994 (.  Defined in the controlled studies that were reviewed as encephalopathy, encephalitis, or encephalomyelitis.\n\n【1】 # TABLE 2.

This conclusion differs from the information contained in the ACIP recommendations because of new information that became available after IOM published this     Deaths occurred primarily among persons known to be immunocompromised.  almost all vaccine adverse events; the few exceptions generally occurred because new information that was available to ACIP had not been available when the IOM committees published their recommendations. These exceptions included a) oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) and Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), b) tetanus-toxoidcontaining vaccines and GBS, and c) DTP and chronic nervous system dysfunction. In addition, this report incorporates information contained in the \"Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices: Use of Vaccines and Immune Globulins in Persons with Altered Immunocompetence\" (MMWR 1993; and the \"General Recommendations on Immunization: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)\" (MMWR 1994;. To facilitate recognition of the new recommendations in this report, all major changes that are being made to the previously published ACIP statements are highlighted within the text. These changes include information on the following vaccines and the possible adverse events associated with their administration:\n- Hepatitis B vaccine and anaphylaxis;\n- Measles vaccine and a) thrombocytopenia and b) possible risk for death resulting from anaphylaxis or disseminated disease in immunocompromised persons;\n- DTP and chronic encephalopathy; and - Tetanus-toxoid-containing vaccines and a) GBS, b) brachial neuritis, and c) possible risk for death resulting from anaphylaxis.\nThe modifications contained in this report, and possibly other changes as new information becomes available, will be incorporated into more comprehensive ACIP recommendations for each vaccine when such statements are revised.\n\n【2】 # HEPATITIS B VACCINE\nThe following recommendations concerning adverse events associated with hepatitis B vaccination update those applicable sections in \"Hepatitis B Virus: A Comprehensive Strategy for Eliminating Transmission in the United States Through Universal Childhood Vaccination-Recommendations of the Immunization Practices Advisory Committee (ACIP)\" (MMWR 1991;.\n\n【3】 # Vaccine Side Effects and Adverse Reactions\nHepatitis B vaccines are safe to administer to adults and children. More than an estimated 10 million adults and 2 million infants and children have been vaccinated in the United States, and at least 12 million children have been vaccinated worldwide.\n\n【4】 # Vaccine-Associated Side Effects\nPain at the injection site (3%-29%) and a temperature greater than 37.7 C (1%-6%) have been among the most frequently reported side effects among adults and children receiving vaccine . In placebo-controlled studies, these side effects were reported no more frequently among vaccinees than among persons receiving a placebo . Among children receiving both hepatitis B vaccine and DTP, these mild side effects have been observed no more frequently than among children receiving only DTP.\nThe recommendation to begin hepatitis B vaccination soon after birth has raised the concern that a substantial number of infants will require an extensive medical evaluation for elevated temperatures secondary to hepatitis B vaccination. Several population-based studies to evaluate this possibility are in progress.\n\n【5】 # Adverse Events\nIn the United States, surveillance of adverse reactions indicated a possible association between GBS and receipt of the first dose of plasma-derived hepatitis B vaccine (CDC, unpublished data; . However, an estimated 2.5 million adults received one or more doses of recombinant hepatitis B vaccine during 1986-1990, and available data concerning these vaccinees do not indicate an association between receipt of recombinant vaccine and GBS (CDC, unpublished data).\nBased on reports to the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS), the estimated incidence rate of anaphylaxis among vaccine recipients is low (i.e., approximately one event per 600,000 vaccine doses distributed). Two of these adverse events occurred in children (CDC, unpublished data). In addition, only one case of anaphylaxis occurred among 100,763 children ages 10-11 years who had been vaccinated with recombinant vaccine in British Columbia (D. Scheifele, unpublished data), and no adverse events were reported among 166,757 children who had been vaccinated with plasma-derived vaccine in New Zealand (. Although none of the persons who developed anaphylaxis died, this adverse event can be fatal; in addition, hepatitis B vaccine can-in rare instances-cause a life-threatening hypersensitivity reaction in some persons (. Therefore, subsequent vaccination with hepatitis B vaccine is contraindicated for persons who have previously had an anaphylactic response to a dose of this vaccine.\nLarge-scale hepatitis B immunization programs for infants in Alaska, New Zealand, and Taiwan have not established an association between vaccination and the occurrence of other severe adverse events, including seizures and GBS (B. McMahon and A. Milne, unpublished data; . However, systematic surveillance for adverse reactions in these populations has been limited, and only a minimal number of children have received recombinant vaccine. Any presumed risk for adverse events that might be causally associated with hepatitis B vaccination must be balanced with the expected risk for hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related liver disease. Currently, an estimated 2,000-5,000 persons in each U.S. birth cohort will die as a result of HBV-related liver disease because of the 5% lifetime risk for HBV infection.\nAs hepatitis B vaccine is introduced for routine vaccination of infants, surveillance for vaccine-associated adverse events will continue to be an important part of the program despite the current record of safety. Any adverse event suspected to be associated with hepatitis B vaccination should be reported to VAERS. VAERS forms can be obtained by calling  822-7967.\n\n【6】 # POLIOMYELITIS PREVENTION\nThe following recommendations concerning adverse events associated with poliomyelitis vaccination update those applicable sections in \"Poliomyelitis Prevention: Recommendation of the Immunization Practices Advisory Committee (ACIP)\" (MMWR 1982;31:22-6,31- and \"Poliomyelitis Prevention: Enhanced-Potency Inactivated Poliomyelitis Vaccine-Supplementary Statement\" (MMWR 1987;36:795-.\n\n【7】 # Precautions and Contraindications Pregnancy\nAlthough no conclusive evidence documents the adverse effects of OPV or inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) in pregnant women and their developing fetuses, vaccination of pregnant women should be avoided. However, if immediate protection against poliomyelitis is necessary, OPV or IPV can be given.\n\n【8】 # Immunodeficiency\nPersons who have congenitally acquired immune-deficiency diseases (e.g., combined immunodeficiency, hypogammaglobulinemia, and agammaglobulinemia) should not be given OPV because of their substantially increased risk for vaccineassociated disease. Furthermore, persons who have altered immune status resulting from acquired conditions (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus  infection, leukemia, lymphoma, or generalized malignancy) or who have immune systems compromised by therapy (e.g., treatment with corticosteroids, alkylating drugs, antimetabolites, or radiation) should not receive OPV because of the theoretical risk for paralytic disease.\nIPV-and not OPV-should be used to vaccinate immunodeficient persons and their household contacts. Many immunosuppressed persons are already immune to polioviruses because of previous vaccination or exposure to wild-type virus when they were immunocompetent. Although such persons should not receive OPV, their risk for paralytic disease may be less than that of persons who have congenitally acquired immunodeficiency. Although a protective immune response to IPV in the immunodeficient patient cannot be ensured, the vaccine is safe and some protection may result from its administration. If a household contact of an immunodeficient person is vaccinated inadvertently with OPV, the OPV recipient should avoid close physical contact with the immunodeficient person for approximately 4-6 weeks after vaccination (i.e., during the period of maximum excretion of vaccine virus). If such contact cannot be avoided, rigorous hygiene and hand washing after contact with feces (e.g., after diaper changing) and avoidance of contact with saliva (e.g., by not sharing eating utensils or food) should be practiced. These practices are an accep, but probably less effective, alternative than refraining from contact. Because immunodeficiency is possible in other children born to a family in which one child is immunodeficient, OPV should not be administered to a member of such a household until the immune status of the recipient and other children in the family is documented.\n\n【9】 # Adverse Reactions OPV\nIn rare instances, administration of OPV has been associated with paralytic poliomyelitis in healthy recipients and their contacts. Very rarely, OPV has caused fatal paralytic poliomyelitis in immunocompromised persons (. Other than efforts for identifying persons with immune-deficiency conditions, no procedures are currently available to identify persons likely to experience such adverse reactions. Although the risk of vaccine-associated paralysis is extremely small for vaccinees and their susceptible, close, personal contacts, they should be informed of this risk.\nAvailable data do not indicate a measurable increased risk for GBS after receipt of OPV. Initial reports (at the time of IOM review) of two studies conducted in Finland suggested that OPV might cause GBS. These studies identified an apparent increased incidence of GBS that was temporally associated with mass OPV vaccination of children and adults who had previously received IPV .\nBecause OPV contains trace amounts of streptomycin, bacitracin, and neomycin, its use is contraindicated in persons who have previously had an anaphylactic reaction to OPV or to these antibiotics.\n\n【10】 # IPV\nNo serious side effects of currently available IPV have been documented. Since IPV contains trace amounts of streptomycin and neomycin, there is a possibility of hypersensitivity reactions in individuals sensitive to these antibiotics.\n\n【11】 # MEASLES PREVENTION\nThe following recommendations concerning adverse events associated with measles vaccination update those applicable sections in \"Measles Prevention: Recommendations of the Immunization Practices Advisory Committee\" (MMWR 1989; , and they apply regardless of whether the vaccine is administered as a single antigen or as a component of measles-rubella (MR) or measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine. Information concerning adverse events associated with the mumps component of MMR vaccine is reviewed later in this document  Mumps Prevention), and information concerning the rubella component is located in the previously published ACIP statement for rubella (.\n\n【12】 # Side Effects and Adverse Reactions\nMore than 240 million doses of measles vaccine were distributed in the United States from 1963 through 1993. The vaccine has an excellent record of safety. From 5% to 15% of vaccinees may develop a temperature of ≥103 F (≥39.4 C) beginning 5-12 days after vaccination and usually lasting several days (. Most persons with fever are otherwise asymptomatic. Transient rashes have been reported for approximately 5% of vaccinees. Central nervous system (CNS) conditions, including encephalitis and encephalopathy, have been reported with a frequency of less than one per million doses administered. The incidence of encephalitis or encephalopathy after measles vaccination of healthy children is lower than the observed incidence of encephalitis of unknown etiology. This finding suggests that the reported severe neurologic disorders temporally associated with measles vaccination were not caused by the vaccine. These adverse events should be anticipated only in susceptible vaccinees and do not appear to be age-related. After revaccination, most reactions should be expected to occur only among the small proportion of persons who failed to respond to the first dose.\n\n【13】 # Personal and Family History of Convulsions\nAs with the administration of any agent that can produce fever, some children may have a febrile seizure. Although children with a personal or family history of seizures are at increased risk for developing idiopathic epilepsy, febrile seizures following vaccinations do not in themselves increase the probability of subsequent epilepsy or other neurologic disorders. Most convulsions following measles vaccination are simple febrile seizures, and they affect children without known risk factors.\nAn increased risk of these convulsions may occur among children with a prior history of convulsions or those with a history of convulsions in first-degree family members (i.e., siblings or parents) (. Although the precise risk cannot be determined, it appears to be low.\nIn developing vaccination recommendations for these children, ACIP considered a number of factors, including risks from measles disease, the large proportion (5%-7%) of children with a personal or family history of convulsions, and the fact that convulsions following measles vaccine are uncommon. Studies conducted to date have not established an association between MMR vaccination and the development of a residual seizure disorder (. ACIP concluded that the benefits of vaccinating these children greatly outweigh the risks. They should be vaccinated just as children without such histories.\nBecause the period for developing vaccine-induced fever occurs approximately 5-12 days after vaccination, prevention of febrile seizures is difficult. Prophylaxis with antipyretics has been suggested as one alternative, but these agents may not be effective if given after the onset of fever. To be effective, such agents would have to be initiated before the expected onset of fever and continued for 5-7 days. However, parents should be alert to the occurrence of fever after vaccination and should treat their children appropriately.\nChildren who are being treated with anticonvulsants should continue to take them after measles vaccination. Because protective levels of most currently available anticonvulsant drugs (e.g., phenobarbital) are not achieved for some time after therapy is initiated, prophylactic use of these drugs does not seem feasible.\nThe parents of children who have either a personal or family history of seizures should be advised of the small increased risk of seizures following measles vaccination. In particular, they should be told in advance what to do in the unlikely event that a seizure occurs. The permanent medical record should document that the small risk of postimmunization seizures and the benefits of vaccination have been discussed.\n\n【14】 # Subacute Sclerosing Panencephalitis (SSPE)\nMeasles vaccine significantly reduces the likelihood of developing SSPE, as evidenced by the near elimination of SSPE cases after widespread measles vaccination began. SSPE has been reported rarely in children who do not have a history of natural measles infection but who have received measles vaccine. The available evidence suggests that at least some of these children may have had an unidentified measles infection before vaccination and that the SSPE probably resulted from the natural measles infection. The administration of live measles vaccine does not increase the risk for SSPE, regardless of whether the vaccinee has had measles infection or has previously received live measles vaccine .\n\n【15】 # Thrombocytopenia\nSurveillance of adverse reactions in the United States and other countries indicates that MMR vaccine can, in rare circumstances, cause clinically apparent thrombocytopenia within the 2 months after vaccination. In prospective studies, the reported incidence of clinically apparent thrombocytopenia after MMR vaccination ranged from one case per 30,000 vaccinated children in Finland ( and Great Britain ( to one case per 40,000 in Sweden, with a temporal clustering of cases occurring 2-3 weeks after vaccination (. With passive surveillance, the reported incidence was approximately one case per 100,000 vaccine doses distributed in Canada and France (, and approximately one case per 1 million doses distributed in the United States (. The clinical course of these cases was usually transient and benign, although hemorrhage occurred rarely (. Furthermore, the risk for thrombocytopenia during rubella or measles infection is much greater than the risk after vaccination. Of 30,000 schoolchildren in one Pennsylvania county who had been infected with rubella during the 1963-64 measles epidemic, 10 children developed thrombocytopenic purpura (incidence: one case per 3,000 children) (. Based on case reports, the risk for thrombocytopenia may be higher for persons who previously have had idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, particularly for those who had thrombocytopenic purpura after an earlier dose of MMR vaccine .\n\n【16】 # Revaccination Risks\nThere is no evidence of an increased risk for adverse reactions after administration of live measles vaccine to persons who are already immune to measles as a result of either previous vaccination or natural disease.\n\n【17】 # Precautions and Contraindications Pregnancy\nLive measles vaccine, when given as a component of MR or MMR, should not be given to women known to be pregnant or who are considering becoming pregnant within the next 3 months. Women who are given monovalent measles vaccine should not become pregnant for at least 30 days after vaccination. This precaution is based on the theoretical risk of fetal infection, although no evidence substantiates this theoretical risk. Considering the importance of protecting adolescents and young adults against measles, asking women if they are pregnant, excluding those who are, and explaining the theoretical risks to the others before vaccination are sufficient precautions.\n\n【18】 # Febrile Illness\nThe decision to administer or delay vaccination because of a current or recent febrile illness depends largely on the cause of the illness and the severity of symptoms. Minor illnesses, such as a mild upper-respiratory infection with or without low-grade fever, are not contraindications for vaccination. For persons whose compliance with medical care cannot be assured, every opportunity should be taken to provide appropriate vaccinations.\nChildren with moderate or severe febrile illnesses can be vaccinated as soon as they have recovered from the acute phase of the illness. This wait avoids superimposing adverse effects of vaccination on the underlying illness or mistakenly attributing a manifestation of the underlying illness to the vaccine. Performing routine physical examinations or measuring temperatures are not prerequisites for vaccinating infants and children who appear to be in good health. Asking the parent or guardian if the child is ill, postponing vaccination for children with moderate or severe febrile illnesses, and vaccinating those without contraindications are appropriate procedures in childhood immunization programs.\n\n【19】 # Allergic Reactions\nHypersensitivity reactions rarely occur after the administration of MMR or any of its component vaccines. Most of these reactions are minor and consist of a wheal and flare or urticaria at the injection site. Immediate, anaphylactic reactions to MMR or its component vaccines are extremely rare. Although >70 million doses of MMR vaccine have been distributed in the United States since VAERS was implemented in 1990, only 33 cases of anaphylactic reactions that occurred after MMR vaccination have been reported. Furthermore, only 11 of these cases a) occurred immediately after vaccination and b) occurred in persons who had symptoms consistent with anaphylaxis (CDC, unpublished data).\nIn the past, persons who had a history of anaphylactic reactions (i.e., hives, swelling of the mouth or throat, difficulty breathing, hypotension, and shock) following egg ingestion were considered to be at increased risk for serious reactions after receipt of measles-containing vaccines, which are produced in chick embryo fibroblasts. Protocols requiring caution were developed for skin testing and vaccinating persons who had had anaphylactic reactions after egg ingestion . However, the predictive value of such skin testing and the need for special protocols when vaccinating egg-allergic persons with measles-containing vaccines is uncertain. The results of recent studies suggest that anaphylactic reactions to measles-containing vaccines are not associated with hypersensitivity to egg antigens but with some other component of the vaccines. The risk for serious allergic reaction to these vaccines in egg-allergic patients is extremely low, and skin testing is not necessarily predictive of vaccine hypersensitivity . Therefore, ACIP is re-evaluating whether skin testing and the use of special protocols are routinely necessary when administering MMR or other measles-containing vaccines to persons who have a history of anaphylactic-like reactions after egg ingestion.\nMMR and its component vaccines contain hydrolyzed gelatin as a stabilizer. The literature contains a single case report of a person with an anaphylactic sensitivity to gelatin who had an anaphylactic reaction after receipt of the MMR vaccine licensed in the United States (. Similar cases have occurred in Japan (. Therefore, ACIP is currently considering recommendations for vaccination of persons who have had an anaphylactic reaction to gelatin or gelatin-containing products. In the meantime, such persons should be vaccinated with MMR and its component vaccines with extreme caution.\nMMR vaccine and its component vaccines contain trace amounts of neomycin. Although the amount present is less than that usually used for a skin test to determine hypersensitivity, persons who have experienced anaphylactic reactions to neomycin should not be given these vaccines. Most often, neomycin allergy is manifested by contact dermatitis rather than anaphylaxis. A history of contact dermatitis to neomycin is not a contraindication to receiving measles vaccine. Live measles virus vaccine does not contain penicillin.\n\n【20】 # Thrombocytopenia\nChildren who have a history of thrombocytopenic purpura or thrombocytopenia may be at increased risk for developing clinically significant thrombocytopenia after MMR vaccination. The decision to vaccinate should depend on the benefits of immunity to measles, mumps, and rubella and the risks for recurrence or exacerbation of thrombocytopenia after vaccination or during natural infections with measles or rubella. The benefits of immunization are usually greater than the potential risks, and administration of MMR vaccine is justified-particularly with regard to the even greater risk for thrombocytopenia after measles or rubella disease. However, avoiding a subsequent dose might be prudent if the previous episode of thrombocytopenia occurred in close temporal proximity to (i.e., within 6 weeks after) the previous vaccination. Serologic evidence of measles immunity in such persons may be sought in lieu of MMR vaccination.\n\n【21】 # Recent Administration of Immune Globulins\n can inhibit the response to rubella vaccine (. The effect of immune globulin preparations on the response to mumps vaccine is unknown, but commercial immune globulin preparations contain antibodies to these viruses.\nBlood (e.g., whole blood, packed red blood cells, and plasma) and other antibodycontaining blood products (e.g., immune globulin; specific immune globulins; and immune globulin, intravenous ) can diminish the immune response to MMR or its individual component vaccines. Therefore, after an immune globulin preparation is received, these vaccines should not be administered before the recommended interval s 4 and . However, the postpartum vaccination of rubella-susceptible women with the rubella or MMR vaccine should not be delayed because anti-Rho(D) IG (human) or any other blood product was received during the last trimester of pregnancy or at delivery. These women should be vaccinated immediately after delivery and, if possible, tested at least 3 months later to ensure immunity to rubella and, if necessary, to measles.\nIf administration of an immune globulin preparation becomes necessary because of imminent exposure to disease, MMR or its component vaccines can be administered simultaneously with the immune globulin preparation, although vaccineinduced immunity might be compromised. The vaccine should be administered at a site remote from that chosen for the immune globulin inoculation. Unless serologic testing indicates that specific antibodies have been produced, vaccination should be repeated after the recommended interval s 4 and .\n can vary. The recommended time intervals are extrapolated from an estimated half-life of 30 days for passively acquired antibody and an observed interference with the immune response to measles vaccine for 5 months after a dose of 80 mg IgG/kg (.  Assumes a serum IgG concentration of 16 mg/mL.  Measles vaccination is recommended for most HIV-infected children who do not have evidence of severe immunosuppression, but it is contraindicated for patients who have congenital disorders of the immune system.  Formerly referred to as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura.\n\n【22】 # TABLE 5. Suggested intervals between administration of immune globulin preparations for various indications and vaccines containing live measles virus*\n<14 days, vaccination should be repeated after the recommended interval s 4  and , unless serologic testing indicates that antibodies were produced.\n\n【23】 # Altered Immunocompetence\nNon-HIV-Infected Persons. Replication of vaccine viruses can be enhanced in persons with immune-deficiency diseases and in persons with immunosuppression, as occurs with leukemia, lymphoma, generalized malignancy, or therapy with alkylating agents, antimetabolites, radiation, or large doses of corticosteroids. Evidence based on case reports has linked measles vaccine and measles infection to subsequent death in some severely immunocompromised children. Of the >200 million doses of measles vaccine administered in the United States, fewer than five such deaths have been reported (. Patients who have such conditions or are undergoing such therapies (excluding most HIV-infected patients) should not be given live measles virus vaccine.\n can reduce the immune response to vaccines. Physicians should wait at least 3 months after discontinuation of therapy before administering a live-virus vaccine to patients who have received high systemically absorbed doses of corticosteroids for ≥2 weeks.\nHIV-Infected Persons. Because of the increased risk for severe complications associated with measles infection and the absence of serious adverse events after measles vaccination among HIV-infected persons .\nBecause of the recently reported case of pneumonitis in a measles vaccinee who had an advanced case of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) ( and because of other evidence indicating a diminished antibody response to measles vaccination among severely immunocompromised persons (, ACIP is re-evaluating the recommendations for vaccination of severely immunocompromised HIV-infected persons. In the interim, it may be prudent to withhold MMR or other measlescontaining vaccines from HIV-infected persons with evidence of severe immunosuppression, defined as either a) CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts <750 for children ages <12 months, <500 for children ages 1-5 years, or <200 for persons ages ≥6 years; or b) CD4+ T-lymphocytes constituting <15% of total lymphocytes for children ages <13 years or <14% for persons ages ≥13 years .\nACIP continues to recommend MMR for HIV-infected persons without evidence of measles immunity ( who are not severely immunocompromised . In addition, health-care providers should weigh the risks and benefits of measles vaccination or IG prophylaxis for severely immunocompromised HIV-infected patients who are at risk for measles exposure because of outbreaks or international travel.\nBecause the immunologic response to both live and killed antigen vaccines may decrease as HIV disease progresses .\n\n【24】 # Management of Patients with Contraindications to Measles Vaccine\nIf immediate protection against measles is required for persons with contraindications to measles vaccination, passive immunization with IG, 0.25 mL/kg (0.11 mL/lb) of body weight (maximum dose=15 mL), should be given as soon as possible after known exposure. Exposed symptomatic HIV-infected and other immunocompromised persons should receive IG regardless of their previous vaccination status; however, IG in usual doses may not be effective in such patients. For immunocompromised persons, the recommended dose is 0.5 mL/kg of body weight if IG is administered intramuscularly (maximum dose=15 mL). This corresponds to a dose of protein of approximately 82.5 mg/kg (maximum dose=2,475 mg). Intramuscular IG may not be needed if a patient with HIV infection is receiving 100-400 mg/kg IGIV at regular intervals and the last dose was given within 3 weeks of exposure to measles. Because the amounts of protein administered are similar, high-dose IGIV may be as effective as IG given intramuscularly. However, no data are available concerning the effectiveness of IGIV in preventing measles.\n\n【25】 # Simultaneous Administration of Vaccines\nIn general, simultaneous administration of the most widely used live and inactivated vaccines does not impair antibody responses or increase rates of adverse reactions (. The administration of MMR vaccine yields results similar to the administration of individual measles, mumps, and rubella vaccines at different sites or at different times.\nVaccines recommended for administration at 12-15 months of age can be administered at either one or two visits. There are equivalent antibody responses and no clinically significant increases in the frequency of adverse events when DTP, MMR, and OPV (or IPV) vaccines and H. influenzae type b conjugate vaccine (HbCV) are administered either simultaneously at different sites or at separate times. If a child might not be brought back for future vaccinations, all vaccines (including DTP , OPV , MMR, varicella, HbCV, and hepatitis B vaccines) may be administered simultaneously, as appropriate to the child's age and previous vaccination status.\n\n【26】 # MUMPS PREVENTION\nThe following recommendations concerning adverse events associated with mumps vaccination update those applicable sections in \"Mumps Prevention\" (MMWR 1989;38:388-92,397-, and they apply regardless of whether the vaccine is administered as a single antigen or as a component of MR or MMR vaccine. Information concerning adverse events associated with the measles component of MMR vaccine is reviewed earlier in this document  Measles Prevention), and information concerning the rubella component is located in the previously published ACIP statement for rubella (.\n\n【27】 # Adverse Effects of Vaccine Use\n have been infrequently reported. However, no evidence suggests that mumps vaccine causes residual seizure disorder (. Although sensorineural deafness following mumps vaccination has been reported rarely, the data are inadequate to distinguish vaccine from nonvaccine causation. No association has been established between mumps vaccination and pancreatic damage or subsequent development of diabetes mellitus (.\n\n【28】 # Contraindications to Vaccine Use Pregnancy\nAlthough mumps vaccine virus has been shown to infect the placenta and fetus , there is no evidence that it causes congenital malformations in humans. However, because of the theoretical risk of fetal damage, it is prudent to avoid giving live virus vaccine to pregnant women. Live mumps vaccine, when combined with rubella vaccine, should not be administered to women known to be pregnant or who are considering becoming pregnant within the next 3 months. Women vaccinated with monovalent mumps vaccine should avoid becoming pregnant for 30 days after the vaccination. Routine precautions for vaccinating postpubertal women include asking if they are or may be pregnant, excluding those who say they are, and explaining the theoretical risk to those who plan to receive the vaccine. Vaccination during pregnancy should not be considered an indication for termination of pregnancy. However, the final decision about interruption of pregnancy must rest with the individual patient and her physician.\n\n【29】 # Severe Febrile Illness\nVaccine administration should not be postponed because of minor or intercurrent febrile illnesses, such as mild upper respiratory infections. However, vaccination of persons with severe febrile illnesses should generally be deferred until they have recovered from the acute phase of the illness.\n\n【30】 # Allergic Reactions\nHypersensitivity reactions rarely occur after the administration of MMR or any of its component vaccines. Most of these reactions are minor and consist of a wheal and flare or urticaria at the injection site. Immediate, anaphylactic reactions to MMR or its component vaccines are extremely rare. Although >70 million doses of MMR vaccine have been distributed in the United States since VAERS was implemented in 1990, only 33 cases of anaphylactic reactions that occurred after MMR vaccination have been reported. Furthermore, only 11 of these cases a) occurred immediately after vaccination and b) occurred in persons who had symptoms consistent with anaphylaxis (CDC, unpublished data).\nIn the past, persons who had a history of anaphylactic reactions (i.e., hives, swelling of the mouth or throat, difficulty breathing, hypotension, and shock) following egg ingestion were considered to be at increased risk for serious reactions after receipt of mumps-containing vaccines, which are produced in chick embryo fibroblasts. Protocols requiring caution were developed for skin testing and vaccinating persons who had had anaphylactic reactions after egg ingestion . However, the predictive value of such skin testing and the need for special protocols when vaccinating egg-allergic persons with mumps-containing vaccines is uncertain. The results of recent studies suggest that anaphylactic reactions to mumps-containing vaccines are not associated with hypersensitivity to egg antigens but with some other component of the vaccines. The risk for serious allergic reaction to these vaccines in egg-allergic patients is extremely low, and skin testing is not necessarily predictive of vaccine hypersensitivity . Therefore, ACIP is re-evaluating whether skin testing and the use of special protocols are routinely necessary when administering mumps-containing vaccines to persons who have a history of anaphylactic-like reactions after egg ingestion.\nMMR and its component vaccines contain hydrolyzed gelatin as a stabilizer. The literature contains a single case report of a person with an anaphylactic sensitivity to gelatin who had an anaphylactic reaction after receipt of the MMR vaccine licensed in the United States (. Similar cases have occurred in Japan (. Therefore, ACIP is currently considering recommendations for vaccination of persons who have had an anaphylactic reaction to gelatin or gelatin-containing products. In the meantime, such persons should be vaccinated with MMR or other mumps vaccines with extreme caution.\nSince mumps vaccine contains trace amounts of neomycin (25 µg), persons who have experienced anaphylactic reactions to topically or systemically administered neomycin should not receive mumps vaccine. Most often, neomycin allergy is manifested as a contact dermatitis, which is a delayed-type (cell-mediated) immune response, rather than anaphylaxis. In such persons, the adverse reaction, if any, to 25 µg of neomycin in the vaccine would be an erythematous, pruritic nodule or papule at the site of injection after 48-96 hours. A history of contact dermatitis to neomycin is not a contraindication to receiving mumps vaccine. Live mumps virus vaccine does not contain penicillin.\n\n【31】 # Recent Injection of Immune Globulin\nThe effect of immune globulin preparations on the response to mumps vaccine is unknown, but commercial immune globulin preparations contain mumps antibodies. Therefore, monovalent mumps or rubella-mumps vaccine should be given at least 2 weeks before the administration of an immune globulin preparation or deferred until approximately 3 months after the administration of an immune globulin preparation. For suggested time intervals between administration of immune globulin preparations and vaccines containing live measles virus, refer to \n\n【32】 # Altered Immunocompetence\nIn theory, replication of the mumps vaccine virus may be potentiated in patients with immune deficiency diseases and by the suppressed immune responses that occur with leukemia, lymphoma, or generalized malignancy or with therapy with corticosteroids, alkylating drugs, antimetabolites, or radiation. In general, patients with such conditions should not be given live mumps virus vaccine. Because vaccinated persons do not transmit mumps vaccine virus, the risk of mumps exposure for those patients may be reduced by vaccinating their close susceptible contacts.\nAn exception to these general recommendations is in persons infected with HIV; asymptomatic HIV-infected children should receive MMR as soon as possible upon reaching their first birthday (, and MMR vaccine should be considered for all symptomatic HIV-infected children who do not have evidence of severe immunosuppression  Measles Prevention, Altered Immunocompetence).\n receive live mumps virus vaccine. Most experts agree that steroid therapy usually does not contraindicate administration of live virus vaccine when it is short term (i.e., <2 weeks); low to moderate dose; long-term, alternate-day treatment with short-acting preparations; maintenance physiologic doses (replacement therapy); or administered topically (skin or eyes), by aerosol, or by intraarticular, bursal, or tendon injection (. However, mumps vaccine should be avoided if systemic immunosuppressive levels are reached by prolonged, extensive, topical application.\n\n【33】 # DTP\nThe following recommendations concerning adverse events associated with DTP vaccination update those applicable sections in \"Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis: Recommendations for Vaccine Use and Other Preventive Measures-Recommendations of the Immunization Practices Advisory Committee (ACIP)\" (MMWR 1991;.\n\n【34】 # Side Effects and Adverse Reactions Following DTP Vaccination\nLocal reactions (generally erythema and induration with or without tenderness) are common after the administration of vaccines containing diphtheria, tetanus, or pertussis antigens. Occasionally, a nodule may be palpable at the injection site of adsorbed products for several weeks. Sterile abscesses at the injection site have been reported rarely (6-10 events per million doses of DTP). Mild systemic reactions such as fever, drowsiness, fretfulness, and anorexia occur frequently. These reactions are substantially more common following the administration of DTP than of DT, but they are self-limited and can be safely managed with symptomatic treatment.\nAcetaminophen is frequently given by physicians to lessen fever and irritability associated with DTP vaccination, and it may be useful in preventing seizures among febrile-convulsion-prone children. However, fever that does not begin until ≥24 hours after vaccination or persists for more than 24 hours after vaccination should not be assumed to be due to DTP vaccination. These new or persistent fevers should be evaluated for other causes so that treatment is not delayed for serious conditions such as otitis media or meningitis. Moderate-to-severe systemic events include high fever (i.e., temperature of ≥40.5 C ); persistent, inconsolable crying lasting ≥3 hours; collapse (hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode); or short-lived convulsions (usually febrile). These events occur infrequently. These events appear to be without sequelae . Other more severe neurologic events, such as a prolonged convulsion or encephalopathy, although rare, have been reported in temporal association with DTP administration.\nApproximate rates for the occurrence of adverse events following receipt of DTP (regardless of dose number in the series or age of the child) are shown in  .\nConcern about the possible role of pertussis vaccine in causing neurologic reactions has been present since the earliest days of vaccine use. Rare but serious acute neurologic illnesses, including encephalitis/encephalopathy and prolonged convulsions, have been anecdotally reported following receipt of whole-cell pertussis vaccine given as DTP  because these events are exceedingly rare, appropriately designed large studies are needed to address the question.\nDespite these methodologic difficulties, the National Childhood Encephalopathy Study (NCES) and other controlled epidemiologic studies have provided evidence that DTP can cause acute encephalopathy . This adverse event occurs rarely, with an estimated risk of zero to 10.5 episodes per million DTP vaccinations (. A detailed follow-up of the NCES indicated that children who had had a serious acute neurologic illness after DTP administration were significantly more likely than children in the control group to have chronic nervous system dysfunction 10 years later. These children with chronic nervous system dysfunction were more likely than children in the control group to have received DTP within 7 days of onset of the original serious acute neurologic illness (i.e., 12  of 367 children vs. six  of 723 children) (.\nAfter reviewing the follow-up data, IOM concluded that the NCES provided evidence of an association between DTP and chronic nervous system dysfunction in children who had had a serious acute neurologic illness after vaccination with DTP. The committee proposed three possible explanations for this association. First, the acute neurologic illness and subsequent chronic nervous system dysfunction might have been caused by DTP. Second, DTP might trigger an acute neurologic illness and subsequent chronic nervous system dysfunction in children who have underlying brain or metabolic abnormalities. Such children might experience similar chronic dysfunction in the absence of DTP vaccination if other stimuli (e.g., fever or infection) are present. Third, DTP might cause an acute neurologic illness in children who have underlying brain or metabolic abnormalities that would inevitably have led to chronic TABLE 6. Adverse events- occurring within 48 hours after vaccination with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis vaccine (DTP) nervous system dysfunction even if the acute neurologic illness had not developed ( . IOM concluded that the NCES data do not support one explanation over another.\n concluded that the results were insufficient to determine whether DTP increases the overall risk for chronic nervous system dysfunction in children.\n reviewed the study and concluded that the results were insufficient to determine whether DTP administration before the acute neurologic event influenced the potential for neurologic dysfunction 10 years later (Ad hoc Subcommittee of the NVAC, unpublished data, . ACIP concurs with this evaluation.\nAlthough the NCES examined and reported risk for the 7 days after DTP vaccination, the increased risk for serious acute neurologic illness occurred primarily during the first 3 days after DTP administration (. Thus, if an association between DTP and chronic encephalopathy exists, the risk is primarily in the first 3 days after DTP vaccination.\nAmong a subset of children who were participating in the NCES and who had infantile spasms, both DTP and DT vaccination appeared either to precipitate early manifestations of the condition or to lead to its identification by parents (. IOM reviewed this and other studies and concluded that neither vaccine causes the illness .\n tended to be vaccinated at older ages than their controls, suggesting that they might have had other unrecognized risk factors for SIDS independent of vaccination. In contrast, DTP vaccination was not associated with SIDS in several larger studies performed in the past decade (62,. In addition, none of three studies that examined unexpected deaths among infants not classified as SIDS found an association with DTP vaccination .\nIOM concluded recently that no available evidence indicates that DTP might cause transverse myelitis, other more subtle neurologic disorders (e.g., hyperactivity, learning disorders, and infantile autism), and progressive degenerative conditions of the CNS (. Furthermore, one study indicated that children who received pertussis vaccine exhibited fewer school problems than those who did not, even after adjustment for socioeconomic status (.\nRecent data suggest that infants and young children who have ever had convulsions (febrile or afebrile) or who have immediate family members with such histories are more likely to have seizures following DTP vaccination than those without such histories .\nRarely, immediate anaphylactic reactions (i.e., swelling of the mouth, breathing difficulty, hypotension, or shock) have been reported after receipt of preparations containing diphtheria, tetanus, and/or pertussis antigens. However, no deaths caused by anaphylaxis following DTP vaccination have been reported to CDC since the inception of vaccine-adverse-events reporting in 1978, a period during which more than 80 million doses of publicly purchased DTP vaccine were administered. While substantial underreporting exists in this passive surveillance system, the severity of anaphylaxis and its immediacy following vaccination suggest that such events are likely to be reported. Although no causal relation to any specific component of DTP has been established, the occurrence of true anaphylaxis usually contraindicates further doses of any one of these components. Rashes that are macular, papular, petechial, or urticarial and appear hours or days after a dose of DTP are frequently antigen-antibody reactions of little consequence or are due to other causes, such as viral illnesses, and are unlikely to recur following subsequent injections . In addition, there is no evidence for a causal relation between DTP vaccination and hemolytic anemia or thrombocytopenic purpura.\n\n【35】 # Precautions and Contraindications\n\n【36】 # General Considerations\nThe decision to administer or delay DTP vaccination because of a current or recent febrile illness depends largely on the severity of the symptoms and their etiology. Although a moderate or severe febrile illness is sufficient reason to postpone vaccination, minor illnesses such as mild upper-respiratory infections with or without low-grade fever are not contraindications. If ongoing medical care cannot be assured, taking every opportunity to provide appropriate vaccinations is particularly important.\nChildren with moderate or severe illnesses with or without fever can receive DTP as soon as they have recovered. Waiting a short period before administering DTP avoids superimposing the adverse effects of the vaccination on the underlying illness or mistakenly attributing a manifestation of the underlying illness to vaccination.\nRoutine physical examinations or temperature measurements are not prerequisites for vaccinating infants and children who appear to be in good health. Appropriate immunization practice includes asking the parent or guardian if the child is ill, postponing DTP vaccination for those with moderate or severe acute illnesses, and vaccinating those without contraindications or precautionary circumstances.\nWhen an infant or child returns for the next dose of DTP, the parent should always be questioned about any adverse events that might have occurred following the previous dose.\nA history of prematurity generally is not a reason to defer vaccination . Preterm infants should be vaccinated according to their chronological age from birth.\nImmunosuppressive therapies-including irradiation, antimetabolites, alkylating agents, cytotoxic drugs, and corticosteroids (used in greater than physiologic doses) -may reduce the immune response to vaccines. Short-term (<2-week) corticosteroid therapy or intra-articular, bursal, or tendon injections with corticosteroids should not be immunosuppressive. Although no specific studies with pertussis vaccine are available, if immunosuppressive therapy will be discontinued shortly, it is reasonable to defer vaccination until the patient has been off therapy for 1 month; otherwise, the patient should be vaccinated while still on therapy (.\n\n【37】 # Special Considerations for Preparations Containing Pertussis Vaccine\n with pertussis disease.\n\n【38】 # Contraindications\nIf any of the following events occur in temporal relationship to the administration of DTP, further vaccination with DTP is contraindicated :\n1. An immediate anaphylactic reaction. The rarity of such reactions to DTP is such that they have not been adequately studied. Because of uncertainty as to which component of the vaccine might be responsible, no further vaccination with any of the three antigens in DTP should be carried out. Alternatively, because of the importance of tetanus vaccination, such individuals may be referred for evaluation by an allergist and desensitized to tetanus toxoid if a specific allergy can be demonstrated . This is defined as an acute, severe CNS disorder occurring within 7 days following vaccination and generally consisting of major alterations in consciousness, unresponsiveness, generalized or focal seizures that persist more than a few hours, with failure to recover within 24 hours. Even though causation by DTP cannot be established, no subsequent doses of pertussis vaccine should be given. It\n\n【39】 # TABLE 7. Contraindications and precautions to subsequent vaccination with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis vaccine (DTP) Classification/Response to DTP vaccination\n\n【40】 # Contraindications\n- An immediate anaphylactic reaction.\n- Encephalopathy occurring within 7 days after vaccination.\n\n【41】 # Precautions\n- Fever ≥105 F (≥40.5 C) that is not attributed to another identifiable cause occurring within 48 hours after vaccination. - Collapse or shock-like state (i.e., a hypotonic-hyporesponsive episdode) occurring within 48 hours after vaccination. - Persistent, inconsolable crying lasting ≥3 hours and occurring within 48 hours after vaccination. - Convulsions with or without fever occurring within 3 days after vaccination. may be desirable to delay for months before administering the balance of the doses of DT necessary to complete the primary schedule. Such a delay allows time for clarification of the child's neurologic status.\n\n【42】 # Precautions\nIf any of the following events occur in temporal relation to receipt of DTP, the decision to give subsequent doses of vaccine containing the pertussis component should be carefully considered . Although these events were considered absolute contraindications in previous ACIP recommendations, there may be circumstances, such as a high incidence of pertussis, in which the potential benefits outweigh possible risks, particularly because these events are not associated with permanent sequelae (. The following events were previously considered contraindications and are now considered precautions:\n to administer acetaminophen, 15 mg/kg of body weight, at the time of vaccination and every 4 hours subsequently for 24 hours .\n\n【43】 # Vaccination of infants and young children who have underlying neurologic disorders\nInfants and children with recognized, possible, or potential underlying neurologic conditions present a unique problem. They seem to be at increased risk for the appearance of manifestations of the underlying neurologic disorder within 2-3 days after vaccination. However, more prolonged manifestations or increased progression of the disorder or exacerbation of the disorder as a result of DTP vaccination have not been recognized (. In addition, most neurologic conditions in infancy and young childhood are associated with evolving, changing neurological findings. Functional abnormalities are often unmasked by progressive neurologic development. Thus, confusion over the interpretation of progressive neurologic signs may arise when DTP vaccination or any other therapeutic or preventive measure is carried out.\nProtection against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis is as important for children with neurologic disabilities as for other children. Such protection may be even more important for neurologically disabled children. They often receive custodial care or attend special schools where the risk of pertussis is greater because DTP vaccination is avoided for fear of adverse reactions. Also, if pertussis affects a neurologically disabled child who has difficulty in handling secretions and in cooperating with symptomatic care, it may aggravate preexisting neurologic problems because of anoxia, intracerebral hemorrhages, and other manifestations of the disease. Whether and when to administer DTP to children with proven or suspected underlying neurologic disorders must be decided on an individual basis. Important considerations include the current local incidence of pertussis, the near absence of diphtheria in the United States, and the low risk of infection with Clostridium tetani. On the basis of these considerations and the nature of the child's disorder, the following approaches are recommended:\n\n【44】 # Vaccination of infants and young children who have a family history of convulsion or other CNS disorder\nA family history of convulsions or other CNS disorder is not a contraindication to pertussis vaccination (. Acetaminophen should be given at the time of DTP vaccination and every 4 hours for 24 hours to reduce the possibility of postvaccination fever .\n\n【45】 # Preparations Containing Diphtheria Toxoid and Tetanus Toxoid\nThe only contraindication to tetanus and diphtheria toxoids is a history of a neurologic or severe hypersensitivity reaction following a previous dose. Vaccination with tetanus and diphtheria toxoids is not known to be associated with an increased risk of convulsions. Local side effects alone do not preclude continued use. If an anaphylactic reaction to a previous dose of tetanus toxoid is suspected, intradermal skin testing with appropriately diluted tetanus toxoid may be useful before a decision is made to discontinue tetanus toxoid vaccination (. In one study, 94 of 95 persons with histories of anaphylactic symptoms following a previous dose of tetanus toxoid were nonreactive following intradermal testing and tolerated further tetanus toxoid challenge without incident (. One person had erythema and induration immediately following skin testing, but tolerated a full IM dose without adverse effects. Mild, nonspecific skin-test reactivity to tetanus toxoid, particularly if used undiluted, appears to be fairly common. Most vaccinees develop inconsequential cutaneous delayed hypersensitivity to the toxoid. Although very rare, severe hypersensitivity reactions may occur after receipt of tetanus-toxoid-containing vaccines; these reactions can be life-threatening (.\nPersons who experienced Arthus-type hypersensitivity reactions or a temperature of >103 F (>39.4 C) following a prior dose of tetanus toxoid usually have high serum tetanus antitoxin levels and should not be given even emergency doses of Td more frequently than every 10 years, even if they have a wound that is neither clean nor minor.\nIf a contraindication to using tetanus-toxoid-containing preparations exists for a person who has not completed a primary series of tetanus toxoid immunization and that person has a wound that is neither clean nor minor, only passive immunization should be given using tetanus IG (TIG).\nOn the basis of a) a report of a 42-year-old man who had GBS on three separate occasions after receipt of tetanus toxoid and b) evidence that a vaccine-induced immunologic response can cause GBS, IOM concluded that tetanus-toxoid-containing vaccines can trigger the onset of GBS in adults. GBS can be a life-threatening disease. Persons who have a history of GBS associated with a particular vaccine may be at increased risk for recurrent GBS after subsequent doses of that vaccine (. However, in a study in which an estimated 1.2 million doses of tetanus-containing toxoid were administered to persons >18 years of age, two cases of GBS were expected by chance alone during the 6 weeks after vaccination, and only one case was reported (CDC, unpublished data). This finding suggests that the risk for GBS after administration of tetanus toxoid is extremely low.\nNo increased risk for GBS has been observed with the use of DTP in children. In a study of 0.7 million children of preschool-ages who were vaccinated with DTP during a 7-year period, three cases of GBS were expected by chance alone during the 6 weeks after vaccination, and only two cases were reported (.\nBecause tetanus vaccination has been associated rarely with recurrence of GBS, the decision to administer additional doses of tetanus-toxoid-containing vaccine to persons who have had GBS within 6 weeks after receiving tetanus toxoid should be based on the benefits of subsequent vaccination and the risk for recurrence of GBS. For example, vaccination is usually justified for children whose primary immunization schedules are incomplete (i.e., fewer than three doses have been received); but routine booster vaccination probably is not indicated for adults who have received three or more doses.\nVaccination with tetanus-toxoid-containing vaccines has been associated with brachial neuritis in adult vaccinees, with a relative risk of 5-10 in comparison with the population-based background incidence and a 1-month attribuincidence of approximately one-half to one case per 100,000 recipients of tetanus toxoid (.\nAlthough no evidence exists that tetanus and diphtheria toxoids are teratogenic, waiting until the second trimester of pregnancy to administer Td is a reasonable precaution for minimizing any concern about the theoretical possibility of such reactions.\n\n【46】 # Misconceptions Concerning Contraindications to DTP\nSome health-care providers inappropriately consider certain conditions or circumstances as contraindications to DTP vaccination. These include the following:\n1. Soreness, redness, or swelling at the DTP vaccination site or temperature of <40.5 C (<105 F). 2. Mild, acute illness with low-grade fever or mild diarrheal illness affecting an otherwise healthy child. 3. Current antimicrobial therapy or the convalescent phase of an acute illness. 4. Recent exposure to an infectious disease. 5. Prematurity. The appropriate age for initiating vaccination among the prematurely born infant is the usual chronological age from birth . Full doses (0.5 mL) of vaccine should be used. 6. History of allergies or relatives with allergies. 7. Family history of convulsions. 8. Family history of SIDS. 9. Family history of an adverse event following DTP vaccination.\n\n【47】 # Event\nFrequency of event", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

In two similarly sized US postmarketing quinapril trials that, combined, enrolled over 3,000 black patients and over 19,000 non-blacks, angioedema was reported in 0.30% and 0.55% of blacks (in Study 1 and 2, respectively) and 0.39% and 0.17% of non-blacks. angioedema associated with laryngeal edema can be fatal. If laryngeal stridor or angioedema of the face, tongue, or glottis occurs, treatment with ACCURETIC should be discontinued immediately, the patient treated in accordance with accepted medical care, and carefully observed until the swelling disappears. In instances where swelling is confined to the face and lips, the condition generally resolves without treatment; antihistamines may be useful in relieving symptoms. Where there is involvement of the tongue, glottis, or larynx likely to cause airway obstruction, emergency therapy including, but not limited to, subcutaneous epinephrine solution 1:1000 (0.3 to 0.5 mL) should be promptly administered  PRECAUTIONS and ADVERSE REACTIONS).\n- Patients taking concomitant mTOR inhibitor (e.g. temsirolimus) therapy may be at increased risk for angioedema.\n- Intestinal angioedema\n- Intestinal angioedema has been reported in patients treated with ACE inhibitors. These patients presented with abdominal pain (with or without nausea or vomiting); in some cases there was no prior history of facial angioedema and C-1 esterase levels were normal. The angioedema was diagnosed by procedures including abdominal CT scan or ultrasound, or at surgery, and symptoms resolved after stopping the ACE inhibitor. Intestinal angioedema should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients on ACE inhibitors presenting with abdominal pain.\n- Patients With a History of angioedema\n CONTRAINDICATIONS).\n- Anaphylactoid Reactions During Desensitization\n- Two patients undergoing desensitizing treatment with Hymenoptera venom while receiving ACE inhibitors sustained life-threatening anaphylactoid reactions. In the same patients, these reactions were avoided when ACE inhibitors were temporarily withheld, but they reappeared upon inadvertent challenge.\n- Anaphylactoid Reactions During Membrane Exposure\n been reported in patients undergoing low-density lipoprotein apheresis with dextran sulfate absorption.\n- Hepatic Failure\n- Rarely, ACE inhibitors have been associated with a syndrome that starts with cholestatic jaundice and progresses to fulminant hepatic necrosis and (sometimes) death. The mechanism of this syndrome is not understood. Patients receiving ACE inhibitors who develop jaundice or marked elevations of hepatic enzymes should discontinue the ACE inhibitor and receive appropriate medical follow-up.\n- Hypotension\n- ACCURETIC can cause symptomatic hypotension, probably not more frequently than either monotherapy. It was reported in 1.2% of 1,571 patients receiving ACCURETIC during clinical trials. Like other ACE inhibitors, quinapril has been only rarely associated with hypotension in uncomplicated hypertensive patients.\n- Symptomatic hypotension sometimes associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia, and rarely acute renal failure and/or death, include patients with the following conditions or characteristi\n be enhanced in the postsympathectomy patients.\n- In patients at risk of excessive hypotension, therapy with ACCURETIC should be started under close medical supervision. Such patients should be followed closely for the first 2 weeks of treatment and whenever the dosage of quinapril or diuretic is increased. Similar considerations may apply to patients with ischemic heart or cerebrovascular disease in whom an excessive fall in blood pressure could result in myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident.\n- If excessive hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in a supine position and, if necessary, treated with intravenous infusion of normal saline. ACCURETIC treatment usually can be continued following restoration of blood pressure and volume. If symptomatic hypotension develops, a dose reduction or discontinuation of ACCURETIC may be necessary.\nImpaired Renal Function\n- ACCURETIC should be used with caution in patients with severe renal disease. thiazides may precipitate azotemia in such patients, and the effects of repeated dosing may be cumulative.\n- When the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is inhibited by quinapril, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals. In patients with severe congestive heart failure, whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (including quinapril) may be associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death.\n- In clinical studies in hypertensive patients with unilateral renal artery stenosis, treatment with ACE inhibitors was associated with increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine; these increases were reversible upon discontinuation of ACE inhibitor, concomitant diuretic, or both. When such patients are treated with ACCURETIC, renal function should be monitored during the first few weeks of therapy.\n include assessment of the renal function  DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).\n- Neutropenia/agranulocytosis\n have a collagen vascular disease, such as systemic lupus erythematosus or scleroderma. Agranulocytosis did occur during quinapril treatment in one patient with a history of neutropenia during previous captopril therapy. Available data from clinical trials of quinapril are insufficient to show that, in patients without prior reactions to other ACE inhibitors, quinapril does not cause agranulocytosis at similar rates. As with other ACE inhibitors, periodic monitoring of white blood cell counts in patients with collagen vascular disease and/or renal disease should be considered.\n- Fetal Toxicity\n- Pregnancy Category D\n- Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue ACCURETIC as soon as possible. These adverse outcomes are usually associated with use of these drugs in the second and third trimester of pregnancy. Most epidemiologic studies examining fetal abnormalities after exposure to antihypertensive use in the first trimester have not distinguished drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system from other antihypertensive agents. Appropriate management of maternal hypertension during pregnancy is important to optimize outcomes for both mother and fetus.\n- In the unusual case that there is no appropriate alternative to therapy with drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system for a particular patient, apprise the mother of the potential risk to the fetus. Perform serial ultrasound examinations to assess the intra-amniotic environment. If oligohydramnios is observed, discontinue ACCURETIC, unless it is considered life-saving for the mother. Fetal testing may be appropriate, based on the week of pregnancy. Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury. Closely observe infants with histories of in utero exposure to ACCURETIC for hypotension, oliguria, and ]  PRECAUTIONS, Pediatric Use).\nIntrauterine exposure to thiazide diuretics is associated with fetal or neonatal jaundice, thrombocytopenia, and possibly other adverse reactions that occurred in adults.\nNo teratogenic effects of quinapril were seen in studies of pregnant rats and rabbits. On a mg/kg basis, the doses used were up to 180 times (in rats) and one time (in rabbits) the maximum recommended human dose. No teratogenic effects of ACCURETIC were seen in studies of pregnant rats and rabbits. On a mg/kg (quinapril/hydrochlorothiazide) basis, the doses used were up to 188/94 times (in rats) and 0.6/0.3 times (in rabbits) the maximum recommended human dose.\n- Impaired Hepatic Function\n- ACCURETIC should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function or progressive liver disease, since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate hepatic coma. Also, since the metabolism of quinapril to quinaprilat is normally dependent upon hepatic esterases, patients with impaired liver function could develop markedly elevated plasma levels of quinapril. No normal pharmacokinetic studies have been carried out in hypertensive patients with impaired liver function.\n- systemic lupus erythematosus\n- thiazide diuretics have been reported to cause exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus.\n- Acute Myopia and Secondary Angle-Closure Glaucoma\n- Hydrochlorothiazide, a sulfonamide, can cause an idiosyncratic reaction, resulting in acute transient myopia and acute angle-closure glaucoma. Symptoms include acute onset of decreased visual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within hours to weeks of drug initiation. Untreated acute angle-closure glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss. The primary treatment is to discontinue hydrochlorothiazide as rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or surgical treatments may need to be considered if the intraocular pressure remains uncontrolled. Risk factors for developing acute angle-closure glaucoma may include a history of sulfonamide or penicillin allergy.\n\n【17】 ## PRECAUTIONS\n\n【18】 ### General\n- Derangements of Serum Electrolytes\n- In clinical trials, hyperkalemia (serum potassium ≥5.8 mmol/L) occurred in approximately 2% of patients receiving quinapril. In most cases, elevated serum potassium levels were isolated values which resolved despite continued therapy. Less than 0.1% of patients discontinued therapy due to hyperkalemia. Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia include renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, and the concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, and/or potassium-containing salt substitutes.\n sensitize or exaggerate the response of the heart to the toxic effects of digitalis. The risk of hypokalemia is greatest in patients with cirrhosis of the liver, in patients experiencing a brisk diuresis, in patients who are receiving inadequate oral intake of electrolytes, and in patients receiving concomitant therapy with corticosteroids or ACTH.\nThe opposite effects of quinapril and hydrochlorothiazide on serum potassium will approximately balance each other in many patients, so that no net effect upon serum potassium will be seen. In other patients, one or the other effect may be dominant. Initial and periodic determinations of serum electrolytes to detect possible electrolyte imbalance should be performed at appropriate intervals.\n- Chloride deficits secondary to thiazide therapy are generally mild and require specific treatment only under extraordinary circumstances (e.g., in liver disease or renal disease). Dilutional hyponatremia may occur in edematous patients in hot weather; appropriate therapy is water restriction rather than administration of salt, except in rare instances when the hyponatremia is life threatening. In actual salt depletion, appropriate replacement is the therapy of choice.\n- Calcium excretion is decreased by thiazides. In a few patients on prolonged thiazide therapy, pathological changes in the parathyroid gland have been observed, with hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia. More serious complications of hyperparathyroidism (renal lithiasis, bone resorption, and peptic ulceration) have not been seen.\n- thiazides increase the urinary excretion of magnesium, and hypomagnesemia may result.\n- Other Metabolic Disturbances\n- thiazide diuretics tend to reduce glucose tolerance and to raise serum levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, and uric acid. These effects are usually minor, but frank gout or overt diabetes may be precipitated in susceptible patients.\n- Cough\n- Presumably due to the inhibition of the degradation of endogenous bradykinin, persistent nonproductive cough has been reported with all ACE inhibitors, resolving after discontinuation of therapy. ACE inhibitor-induced cough should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cough.\n- Surgery/Anesthesia\n- In patients undergoing surgery or during anesthesia with agents that produce hypotension, quinapril will block the angiotensin II formation that could otherwise occur secondary to compensatory renin release. Hypotension that occurs as a result of this mechanism can be corrected by volume expansion.\n\n【19】 # Adverse Reactions\n\n【20】 ## Clinical Trials Experience\nACCURETIC has been evaluated for safety in 1571 patients in controlled and uncontrolled studies. Of these, 498 were given quinapril plus hydrochlorothiazide for at least 1 year, with 153 patients extending combination therapy for over 2 years. In clinical trials with ACCURETIC, no adverse experience specific to the combination has been observed. Adverse experiences that have occurred have been limited to those that have been previously reported with quinapril or hydrochlorothiazide.\nAdverse experiences were usually mild and transient, and there was no relationship between side effects and age, sex, race, or duration of therapy. Discontinuation of therapy because of adverse effects was required in 2.1% in patients in controlled studies. The most common reasons for discontinuation of therapy with ACCURETIC were cough (1.0%; see PRECAUTIONS) and headache (0.7%).\nAdverse experiences probably or possibly related to therapy or of unknown relationship to therapy occurring in 1% or more of the 943 patients treated with quinapril plus hydrochlorothiazide in controlled trials are shown below.\nClinical adverse experiences probably, possibly, or definitely related or of uncertain relationship to therapy occurring in ≥0.5% to <1.0% (except as noted) of the patients treated with quinapril/HCTZ in controlled and uncontrolled trials (N= and less frequent, clinically significant events seen in clinical trials or postmarketing experience (the rarer events are in italics) include (listed by body system):\n\n【21】 ## Postmarketing Experience\nThe following serious nonfatal adverse events, regardless of their relationship to quinapril and HCTZ combination ts, have been reported during extensive postmarketing experience:\n- BODY AS A WHOLE: Shock, accidental injury, neoplasm, cellulitis, ascites, generalized edema, hernia and anaphylactoid reaction.\n- 'CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: Bradycardia, cor pulmonale, vasculitis, and deep thrombosis.\n- DIGESTIVE SYSTEM: Gastrointestinal carcinoma, cholestatic jaundice, hepatitis, esophagitis, vomiting, and diarrhea.\n- HEMIC SYSTEM: Anemia.\n- METABOLIC AND NUTRITIONAL DISORDERS: Weight loss.\n- MUSCULOSKELETAL SYSTEM: Myopathy, myositis, and arthritis.\n- NERVOUS SYSTEM: Paralysis, hemiplegia, speech disorder, abnormal gait, meningism, and amnesia.\n- RESPIRATORY SYSTEM: Pneumonia, asthma, respiratory infiltration, and lung disorder.\n- SKIN AND APPENDAGES: Urticaria, macropapular rash, and petechiases.\n- SPECIAL SENSES: Abnormal vision.\n- UROGENITAL SYSTEM: Kidney function abnormal, albuminuria, pyuria, hematuria, and nephrosis.\n seen with ACCURETIC. In addition, the following were reported for quinapril at an incidence >0.5%: depression, back pain, constipation, syncope, and amblyopia.\nHydrochlorothiazide has been extensively prescribed for many years, but there has not been enough systematic collection of data to support an estimate of the frequency of the observed adverse reactions. Within organ-system groups, the reported reactions are listed here in decreasing order of severity, without regard to frequency.\n\n【22】 ## Clinical Laboratory Test Findings\n- Serum Electrolytes\n PRECAUTIONS.\n- Creatinine, Blood Urea Nitrogen\n- Increases (>1.25 times the upper limit of normal) in serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen were observed in 3% and 4%, respectively, of patients treated with ACCURETIC. Most increases were minor and reversible, which can occur in patients with essential hypertension but most frequently in patients with renal artery stenosis  PRECAUTIONS).\n- PBI and Tests of Parathyroid Function\n PRECAUTIONS.\n- Hematology\n WARNINGS.\n- Other (causal relationships unknown)\n- Other clinically important changes in standard laboratory tests were rarely associated with ACCURETIC administration. Elevations in uric acid, glucose, magnesium, cholesterol, triglyceride, and calcium  PRECAUTIONS) have been reported.\n\n【23】 # Drug Interactions\n- Potassium Supplements and Potassium-Sparing Diuretics\n- As noted above (\"Derangements of Serum Electrolytes\"), the net effect of ACCURETIC may be to elevate a patient's serum potassium, to reduce it, or to leave it unchanged. Potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone, amiloride, triamterene, and others) or potassium supplements can increase the risk of hyperkalemia. If concomitant use of such agents is indicated, they should be given with caution, and the patient's serum potassium should be monitored frequently.\n- Lithium\n- Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving ACE inhibitors during therapy with lithium. Because renal clearance of lithium is reduced by thiazides, the risk of lithium toxicity is presumably raised further when, as in therapy with ACCURETIC, a thiazide diuretic is coadministered with the ACE inhibitor. ACCURETIC and lithium should be coadministered with caution, and frequent monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended.\n- Tetracycline and Other Drugs That Interact with Magnesium\n- Simultaneous administration of tetracycline with quinapril reduced the absorption of tetracycline by approximately 28% to 37%, possibly due to the high magnesium content in quinapril ts. This interaction should be considered if coprescribing quinapril and tetracycline or other drugs that interact with magnesium.\n- Gold\n- Nitritoid reactions (symptoms include facial flushing, nausea, vomiting, and hypotension) have been reported rarely in patients on therapy with injecgold (sodium aurothiomalate) and concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy.\n- Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors)\n- In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with ACE inhibitors, including quinapril, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving quinapril and NSAID therapy.\n- The antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors, including quinapril may be attenuated by NSAIDs.\n- Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS)\n- Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on ACCURETIC and other agents that affect the RAS.\nDo not co-administer aliskiren with ACCURETIC in patients with diabetes. Avoid concomitant use of aliskiren with ACCURETIC in patients with renal impairment (GFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m.\n- Agents that inhibit mTOR\n- Patients taking concomitant mTOR inhibitor (e.g. temsirolimus) therapy may be at increased risk for angioedema.\n- Other Agents\n- Drug interaction studies of quinapril and other agents showed:\n- Multiple dose therapy with propranolol or cimetidine has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of single doses of quinapril.\n- The anticoagulant effect of a single dose of warfarin (measured by prothrombin time) was not significantly changed by quinapril coadministration twice daily.\n- Quinapril treatment did not affect the pharmacokinetics of digoxin.\n- No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed when single doses of quinapril and hydrochlorothiazide were administered concomitantly.\n- When administered concurrently, the following drugs may interact with thiazide diuretics.\n- Alcohol, Barbiturates, or Narcotics—potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur.\n- Antidiabetic Drugs (oral hypoglycemic agents and insulin)—dosage adjustments of the antidiabetic drug may be required.\n- Cholestyramine and Colestipol Resin—absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins. Single doses of either cholestyramine or colestipol resins bind the hydrochlorothiazide and reduce its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract by up to 85% and 43%, respectively.\n- Corticosteroids, ACTH—intensified electrolyte depletion, particularly hypokalemia.\n- Pressor Amines (e.g., norepinephrine)—possible decreased response to pressor amines, but not sufficient to preclude their therapeutic use.\nSkeletal Muscle Relaxants, Nondepolarizing (e.g., tubocurarine)—possible increased responsiveness to the muscle relaxant.\n- Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs—the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of thiazide diuretics may be reduced by concurrent administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents.\n\n【24】 # Use in Specific Populations\n\n【25】 ### Pregnancy\nPregnancy Category (FDA): D\nUse of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue ACCURETIC as soon as possible. These adverse outcomes are usually associated with use of these drugs in the second and third trimester of pregnancy. Most epidemiologic studies examining fetal abnormalities after exposure to antihypertensive use in the first trimester have not distinguished drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system from other antihypertensive agents. Appropriate management of maternal hypertension during pregnancy is important to optimize outcomes for both mother and fetus.\n- In the unusual case that there is no appropriate alternative to therapy with drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system for a particular patient, apprise the mother of the potential risk to the fetus. Perform serial ultrasound examinations to assess the intra-amniotic environment. If oligohydramnios is observed, discontinue ACCURETIC, unless it is considered life-saving for the mother. Fetal testing may be appropriate, based on the week of pregnancy. Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury. Closely observe infants with histories of in utero exposure to ACCURETIC for hypotension, oliguria, and hyperkalemia  PRECAUTIONS, Pediatric Use).\nIntrauterine exposure to thiazide diuretics is associated with fetal or neonatal jaundice, thrombocytopenia, and possibly other adverse reactions that occurred in adults.\nNo teratogenic effects of quinapril were seen in studies of pregnant rats and rabbits. On a mg/kg basis, the doses used were up to 180 times (in rats) and one time (in rabbits) the maximum recommended human dose. No teratogenic effects of ACCURETIC were seen in studies of pregnant rats and rabbits.

Exchange transfusions or dialysis may be required as a means of reversing hypotension and/or substituting for disordered renal function. Removal of quinapril, which crosses the placenta, from the neonatal circulation is not significantly accelerated by these means.\nSafety and effectiveness of ACCURETIC in children have not been established.\n\n【29】 ### Geriatic Use\nClinical studies of quinapril HCl/hydrochlorothiazide did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.\n\n【30】 ### Gender\n(Description)\n\n【31】 ### Race\n(Description)\n\n【32】 ### Renal Impairment\nRegimens of therapy with ACCURETIC need not take account of renal function as long as the patient's creatinine clearance is >30 mL/min/1.73 m2 (serum creatinine roughly ≤3 mg/dL or 265 µmol/L). In patients with more severe renal impairment, loop diuretics are preferred to thiazides. Therefore, ACCURETIC is not recommended for use in these patients.\n\n【33】 ### Hepatic Impairment\n(Description)\n\n【34】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\n(Description)\n\n【35】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\n(Description)\n\n【36】 ### Others\n(Description)\n\n【37】 # Administration and Monitoring\n\n【38】 ### Administration\nAs individual monotherapy, quinapril is an effective treatment of hypertension in once-daily doses of 10 to 80 mg and hydrochlorothiazide is effective in doses of 12.5 to 50 mg. In clinical trials of quinapril/hydrochlorothiazide combination therapy using quinapril doses of 2.5 to 40 mg and hydrochlorothiazide doses of 6.25 to 25 mg, the antihypertensive effects increased with increasing dose of either component.\nThe side effects  WARNINGS) of quinapril are generally rare and apparently independent of dose; those of hydrochlorothiazide are a mixture of dose-dependent phenomena (primarily hypokalemia) and dose-independent phenomena (e.g., pancreatitis), the former much more common than the latter. Therapy with any combination of quinapril and hydrochlorothiazide will be associated with both sets of dose-independent side effects, but regimens that combine low doses of hydrochlorothiazide with quinapril produce minimal effects on serum potassium. In clinical trials of ACCURETIC, the average change in serum potassium was near zero in subjects who received HCTZ 6.25 mg in the combination, and the average subject who received 10 to 40/12.5 to 25 mg experienced a milder reduction in serum potassium than that experienced by the average subject receiving the same dose of hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy.\nTo minimize dose-independent side effects, it is usually appropriate to begin combination therapy only after a patient has failed to achieve the desired effect with monotherapy.\nTherapy Guided by Clinical Effect\nPatients whose blood pressures are not adequately controlled with quinapril monotherapy may instead be given ACCURETIC 10/12.5 or 20/12.5. Further increases of either or both components could depend on clinical response. The hydrochlorothiazide dose should generally not be increased until 2 to 3 weeks have elapsed. Patients whose blood pressures are adequately controlled with 25 mg of daily hydrochlorothiazide, but who experience significant potassium loss with this regimen, may achieve blood pressure control with less electrolyte disturbance if they are switched to ACCURETIC 10/12.5 or 20/12.5.\nReplacement Therapy\nFor convenience, patients who are adequately treated with 20 mg of quinapril and 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide and experience no significant electrolyte disturbances may instead wish to receive ACCURETIC 20/25.\nUse in Renal Impairment\nRegimens of therapy with ACCURETIC need not take account of renal function as long as the patient's creatinine clearance is >30 mL/min/1.73 m2 (serum creatinine roughly ≤3 mg/dL or 265 µmol/L). In patients with more severe renal impairment, loop diuretics are preferred to thiazides. Therefore, ACCURETIC is not recommended for use in these patients.\n\n【39】 ### Monitoring\nThere is limited information regarding Quinapril/Hydrochlorothiazide Monitoring in the drug label.\n\n【40】 # IV Compatibility\nThere is limited information regarding the compatibility of Quinapril/Hydrochlorothiazide and IV administrations.\n\n【41】 # Overdosage\nNo specific information is available on the treatment of overdosage with ACCURETIC or quinapril monotherapy; treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. Therapy with ACCURETIC should be discontinued, and the patient should be observed. Dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, and hypotension should be treated by established procedures.\nThe oral median lethal dose of quinapril/hydrochlorothiazide in combination ranges from 1063/664 to 4640/2896 mg/kg in mice and rats. Doses of 1440 to 4280 mg/kg of quinapril cause significant lethality in mice and rats. In single-dose studies of hydrochlorothiazide, most rats survived doses up to 2.75 g/kg.\n been administered, hypokalemia may accentuate cardiac arrhythmias.\nLaboratory determinations of serum levels of quinapril and its metabolites are not widely available, and such determinations have, in any event, no established role in the management of quinapril overdose.\nNo data are available to suggest physiological maneuvers (e.g., maneuvers to change the pH of the urine) that might accelerate elimination of quinapril and its metabolites. Hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis have little effect on the elimination of quinapril and quinaprilat.\nAngiotensin II could presumably serve as a specific antagonist-antidote in the setting of quinapril overdose, but angiotensin II is essentially unavailable outside of scattered research facilities. Because the hypotensive effect of quinapril is achieved through vasodilation and effective hypovolemia, it is reasonable to treat quinapril overdose by infusion of normal saline solution.\n\n【42】 # Pharmacology\nThere is limited information regarding Quinapril/Hydrochlorothiazide Pharmacology in the drug label.\n\n【43】 ## Mechanism of Action\n stimulates the secretion of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex, thereby facilitating renal sodium and fluid reabsorption. Reduced aldosterone secretion by quinapril may result in a small increase in serum potassium. In controlled hypertension trials, treatment with quinapril alone resulted in mean increases in potassium of 0.07 mmol/L  PRECAUTIONS). Removal of angiotensin II negative feedback on renin secretion leads to increased plasma renin activity (PRA).\nWhile the principal mechanism of antihypertensive effect is thought to be through the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, quinapril exerts antihypertensive actions even in patients with low renin hypertension. Quinapril was an effective antihypertensive in all races studied, although it was somewhat less effective in blacks (usually a predominantly low renin group) than in non-blacks. ACE is identical to kininase II, an enzyme that degrades bradykinin, a potent peptide vasodilator; whether increased levels of bradykinin play a role in the therapeutic effect of quinapril remains to be elucidated.\nHydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary potassium loss, and decreases in serum potassium. The renin-aldolsterone link is mediated by angiotensin, so coadministration of an ACE inhibitor tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these diuretics.\nThe mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of thiazides is unknown.\n\n【44】 ## Structure\nACCURETIC is a fixed-combination t that combines an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, quinapril hydrochloride, and a thiazide diuretic, hydrochlorothiazide.\nQuinapril hydrochloride is chemically described as , 3R*] ]-2-amino]-1-oxopropyl]-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-3-isoquinolinecarboxylic acid, monohydrochloride. Its empirical formula is C25H30N2O5. HCl and its structural formula is:\nQuinapril hydrochloride is a white to off-white amorphous powder that is freely soluble in aqueous solvents.\nHydrochlorothiazide is chemically described as: 6-Chloro-3,4-dihydro-2H-1,2,4-benzothiadiazine-7-sulfonamide 1,1-dioxide. Its empirical formula is C7H8CIN3O4S2 and its structural formula is:\nHydrochlorothiazide is a white to off-white, crystalline powder which is slightly soluble in water but freely soluble in sodium hydroxide solution.\nACCURETIC is available for oral use as fixed combination ts in three strengths of quinapril with hydrochlorothiazi\n\n【45】 ## Pharmacodynamics\nSingle doses of 20 mg of quinapril provide over 80% inhibition of plasma ACE for 24 hours. Inhibition of the pressor response to angiotensin I is shorter-lived, with a 20-mg dose giving 75% inhibition for about 4 hours, 50% inhibition for about 8 hours, and 20% inhibition at 24 hours. With chronic dosing, however, there is substantial inhibition of angiotensin II levels at 24 hours by doses of 20 to 80 mg.\nAdministration of 10 to 80 mg of quinapril to patients with mild to severe hypertension results in a reduction of sitting and standing blood pressure to about the same extent with minimal effect on heart rate. Symptomatic postural hypotension is infrequent, although it can occur in patients who are salt- and/or volume-depleted  WARNINGS).\nAntihypertensive activity commences within 1 hour with peak effects usually achieved by 2 to 4 hours after dosing. During chronic therapy, most of the blood pressure lowering effect of a given dose is obtained in 1 to 2 weeks. In multiple-dose studies, 10 to 80 mg per day in single or divided doses lowered systolic and diastolic blood pressure throughout the dosing interval, with a trough effect of about 5 to 11/3 to 7 mm Hg. The trough effect represents about 50% of the peak effect.\nWhile the dose-response relationship is relatively flat, doses of 40 to 80 mg were somewhat more effective at trough than 10 to 20 mg, and twice-daily dosing tended to give a somewhat lower trough blood pressure than once-daily dosing with the same total dose. The antihypertensive effect of quinapril continues during long-term therapy, with no evidence of loss of effectiveness.\nHemodynamic assessments in patients with hypertension indicate that blood pressure reduction produced by quinapril is accompanied by a reduction in total peripheral resistance and renal vascular resistance with little or no change in heart rate, cardiac index, renal blood flow, glomerular filtration rate, or filtration fraction.\nTherapeutic effects of quinapril appear to be the same for elderly (≥65 years of age) and younger adult patients given the same daily dosages, with no increase in adverse events in elderly patients. In patients with hypertension, quinapril 10 to 40 mg was similar in effectiveness to captopril, enalapril, propranolol, and thiazide diuretics.\nAfter oral administration of hydrochlorothiazide, diuresis begins within 2 hours, peaks in about 4 hours, and lasts about 6 to 12 hours. Use of quinapril with a thiazide diuretic gives blood pressure lowering effect greater than that seen with either agent alone. In clinical trials of quinapril/hydrochlorothiazide using quinapril doses of 2.5 to 40 mg and hydrochlorothiazide doses of 6.25 to 25 mg, the antihypertensive effects were sustained for at least 24 hours, and increased with increasing dose of either component. Although quinapril monotherapy is somewhat less effective in blacks than in non-blacks, the efficacy of combination therapy appears to be independent of race. By blocking the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis, administration of quinapril tends to reduce the potassium loss associated with the diuretic. In clinical trials of ACCURETIC, the average change in serum potassium was near zero when 2.5 to 40 mg of quinapril was combined with hydrochlorothiazide 6.25 mg, and the average subject who received 10 to 20/12.5 to 25 mg experienced a milder reduction in serum potassium than that experienced by the average subject receiving the same dose of hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy.\n\n【46】 ## Pharmacokinetics\nThe rate and extent of absorption of quinapril and hydrochlorothiazide from ACCURETIC ts are not different, respectively, from the rate and extent of absorption of quinapril and hydrochlorothiazide from immediate-release monotherapy formulations, either administered concurrently or separately. Following oral administration of Accupril (quinapril monotherapy) ts, peak plasma quinapril concentrations are observed within 1 hour. Based on recovery of quinapril and its metabolites in urine, the extent of absorption is at least 60%. The absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is somewhat slower (1 to 2.5 hours) and more complete (50% to 80%).\nThe rate of quinapril absorption was reduced by 14% when ACCURETIC ts were administered with a high-fat meal as compared to fasting, while the extent of absorption was not affected. The rate of hydrochlorothiazide absorption was reduced by 12% when ACCURETIC ts were administered with a high-fat meal, while the extent of absorption was not significantly affected. Therefore, ACCURETIC may be administered without regard to food.\n accumulates in red blood cells, so that whole blood levels are 1.6 to 1.8 times those measured in plasma.\nSome placental passage occurred when quinapril was administered to pregnant rats. Studies in rats indicate that quinapril and its metabolites do not cross the blood-brain barrier. Hydrochlorothiazide crosses the placenta freely but not the blood-brain barrier.\nQuinaprilat is eliminated primarily by renal excretion, up to 96% of an IV dose, and has an elimination half-life in plasma of approximately 2 hours and a prolonged terminal phase with a half-life of 25 hours. Hydrochlorothiazide is excreted unchanged by the kidney. When plasma levels have been followed for at least 24 hours, the plasma half-life has been observed to vary between 4 to 15 hours. At least 61% of the oral dose is eliminated unchanged within 24 hours.\nIn patients with renal insufficiency, the elimination half-life of quinaprilat increases as creatinine clearance decreases. There is a linear correlation between plasma quinaprilat clearance and creatinine clearance. In patients with end-stage renal disease, chronic hemodialysis or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis have little effect on the elimination of quinapril and quinaprilat. Elimination of quinaprilat is reduced in elderly patients (≥65 years) and in those with heart failure; this reduction is attributo decrease in renal function  DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Quinaprilat concentrations are reduced in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis due to impaired deesterification of quinapril. In a study of patients with impaired renal function (mean creatinine clearance of 19 mL/min), the half-life of hydrochlorothiazide elimination was lengthened to 21 hours.\nThe pharmacokinetics of quinapril and quinaprilat are linear over a single-dose range of 5- to 80-mg doses and 40- to 160-mg in multiple daily doses.\n\n【47】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\nCarcinogenicity, mutagenicity, and fertility studies have not been conducted in animals with ACCURETIC.\n negative in the following genetic toxicology studies: in vitro mammalian cell point mutation, sister chromatid exchange in cultured mammalian cells, micronucleus test with mice, in vitro chromosome aberration with V79 cultured lung cells, and in an in vivo cytogenetic study with rat bone marrow. There were no adverse effects on fertility or reproduction in rats at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day (60 and 10 times the maximum daily human dose when based on mg/kg and mg/m2, respectively).\n obtained in the Aspergillus nidulans nondisjunction assay, using an unspecified concentration of hydrochlorothiazide.\nHydrochlorothiazide had no adverse effects on the fertility of mice and rats of either sex in studies wherein these species were exposed, via their diets, to doses of up to 100 and 4 mg/kg/day, respectively, prior to mating and throughout gestation.\n\n【48】 # Clinical Studies\n(Description)\n(Description)\n(Description)\n\n【49】 # How Supplied\n(Description)\n\n【50】 ## Storage\nThere is limited information regarding Quinapril/Hydrochlorothiazide Storage in the drug label.\n\n【51】 # Images\n\n【52】 ## Drug Images\n\n【53】 ## Package and Label Display Panel\n\n【54】 # Patient Counseling Information\n(Patient Counseling Information)\n\n【55】 # Precautions with Alcohol\nAlcohol-Quinapril and Hydrochlorothiazide t interaction has not been established.
