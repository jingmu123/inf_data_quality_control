Therefore, the committee made recommendations based on their knowledge and experience\n【333】 - The committee listed some topics that they thought most people with acne vulgaris would find useful in relation to the condition and their care. Among these topics, the committee noted that there were some drawbacks of treatments and that it is important to encourage people to adhere to treatment, because improvement may not be seen immediately. The committee acknowledged that general information about adherence is covered in the NICE guideline on medicines adherence to which they cross-referred\n【334】 - The committee were aware that general principles about tailoring information to people's needs and circumstance are set out in the NICE guideline on patient experience in adult NHS services and agreed that this would also be relevant to young people, the age group that acne is most common in\n【335】 - Based on their experience, the committee agreed that some people may need support from parents or carers during treatment discussions, but noted that outside of these situations parents and carers should only be involved if the person requests it\n【336】 - Because of the lack of evidence the committee made a recommendation for research on what information people with acne vulgaris would value, and what impact this would have on their satisfaction with services and shared decision making\n【337】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\n【338】 - The recommendation aims to standardise what information is provided, and how it is given. No impact on resources is expected\n A: information and support\n【340】 -\n【341】 # Skin care advice\n【342】 -\n【343】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\n【344】 - Overall, the evidence on skin care products was very limited, but what evidence was available suggested that syndet skin cleansing products used twice daily reduce inflammatory and non-inflammatory acne vulgaris lesion counts. Compared to traditional soap bars, non-alkaline (skin pH neutral or slightly acidic) syndet products are less irritant and do not form a residue layer, so they rinse off easily. Syndet cleansing products have a relatively high free fatty acid content which helps to maintain skin hydration. Although the research was carried out using a syndet bar, many syndets are now available in different formulations such as liquid or foam. The committee agreed that different formulations are probably similarly effective, so it would be reasonable to try the cheapest syndet cleansing product in the first instance. Because of the limited evidence they recommended this as general skin care advice rather than as a treatment\n【345】 - Although there was some limited evidence on the use of acidic skin cleansers and benzoyl peroxide-based face washes, the committee agreed that this was not sufficient to make a recommendation\n【346】 - No relevant evidence was identified on the use of other skin care products, such as oil-free and non-comedogenic products or make-up. Based on the committee's knowledge, oil-based and comedogenic products can make acne vulgaris worse because acne is typified by excessively oily skin and the blocking of skin pores. The committee noted that make-up should be removed at the end of the day, but because of the lack of evidence they decided they could not be prescriptive about the products that should be used for make-up removal. The committee discussed how people often pick or scratch their acne lesions. In the committee's experience this can lead to scarring, so they recommended that people are advised to avoid these behaviours. Given that the evidence on risk factors for scarring was limited the committee decided that further information was needed, and made a research recommendation on the risk factors for acne vulgaris-related scarring\n【347】 - Clinicians are frequently asked for skin care advice and it is therefore an important topic for people with acne. Because of the limited evidence the committee decided to prioritise a recommendation for research on what skin care advice is appropriate for people with acne\n【348】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\n【349】 - The committee noted that there is currently variation in the type of advice that is provided to people with acne and therefore recommendations are aimed at standardising practice\n L: risk factors for scarring due to acne vulgaris\n【351】 -\n【352】 # Diet\n【353】 - \n【354】 ## Why the committee made the recommendation\n【355】 - The committee reviewed the evidence from limited randomised controlled trials that examined the effectiveness of a low-glycaemic load diet in people with acne vulgaris\n of benefit did not outweigh the risk. However, the committee thought that it is generally useful to promote a healthy balanced diet so they added a recommendation linking to Public Health England's advice about this topic\n【357】 - Given the limited evidence the committee decided that further research is needed in this area and made a recommendation for research on the effect of dietary interventions or dietary changes on acne to encourage this\n【358】 ## How the recommendation might affect practice\n【359】 - The recommendation will not have a substantial impact on current practice\n C: dietary interventions for the treatment of acne vulgaris\n【361】 - \n【362】 # Referral to specialist care\n【363】 -\n【364】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\n【365】 - No evidence was identified comparing different criteria of referral to specialist care. The committee therefore made recommendations based on their expertise and experience. When discussing referral related to scarring the committee also considered evidence related to risk factors for scarring\n【366】 - The committee discussed what would constitute 'specialist care' and who the referral would be made to. They agreed that, in line with current advice , people who may go on to have treatment with isotretinoin should be referred to a consultant dermatologist-led team to ensure the person's safety and wellbeing\n【367】 - The committee decided that people with acne fulminans have to be urgently referred in order to be assessed within 24 hours because this condition could make people seriously unwell, potentially needing them to be admitted to hospital\n【368】 - The committee agreed that referral should take place when the diagnosis is unclear, for example when the lesion is potentially caused by another condition, or when people have severe forms of acne. Such referrals should be made so that progression of acne symptoms (such as pigmentary changes or scarring) or other issues (such as mental health) can be addressed as soon as possible, and outcomes improved\n【369】 - Because of the psychological impact that acne or acne-related scarring can have, the committee recommended that people who are persistently psychologically distressed by this could be referred. As levels of psychological distress can be interpreted in many different ways, and what may or may not count as persistent can also vary, the committee recommended that this should be judged on a case-by-case basis\n【370】 - The committee discussed the importance of the identification of risk factors for scarring so that these can be addressed to prevent this. They therefore made a recommendation for research on the risk factors for acne vulgaris-related scarring\n【371】 - The committee recognised that acne vulgaris can have a psychological and social impact on people, potentially causing anxiety or depression. It can also exacerbate pre-existing mental health conditions. They discussed that it is important to refer people to mental health services if there are serious mental health concerns to ensure people's safety. In line with the MHRA advice related to mental health adverse events related to oral isotretinoin use, the committee highlighted that awareness of possible mental health disorders or psychological distress, resulting in a need for referral to mental health services, is particularly important when considering this treatment\n【372】 - The committee agreed that it was important to raise awareness that people with an underlying condition should have their acne treated, but in addition the healthcare professional should provide condition-specific management if possible, or referral should be considered if the healthcare professional does not have expertise in management of the specific condition\n【373】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\n【374】 - The recommendations aim to reduce the variability in referral for people with acne to specialist care. Having standard criteria would also encourage more timely referrals. Timely referrals will improve outcomes and reduce the potential risk of scarring through appropriate implementation of treatment or management strategies for people with acne. There may be increased resources needed for urgent referral; however the population with acne fulminans is very small and therefore the resource impact is unlikely to be substantial\n D: referral to specialist care\n【376】 -\n【377】 # First-line treatment options\n【378】 -\n【379】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\n【380】 - Based on the evidence, the committee concluded that there were a number of pharmacological treatment options that were clinically and cost effective. For each of the 2 examined levels of acne severity (mild to moderate acne and moderate to severe acne), the identified evidence showed that a range of treatments had similar clinical and cost effectiveness. The committee recommended 5 treatments (2 treatment options for both levels of severity, 1 option specifically for mild to moderate acne and 2 options specifically for moderate to severe acne, all according to relevant evidence), with the advantages and disadvantages of each given in a to help shared decision making. The committee decided that all of these options would be given as a 12‑week course, as this was consistent with current practice and also the most common course length in the evidence\n【381】 - The committee noted that the evidence showed that combinations of topical treatments that included benzoyl peroxide, clindamycin and/or a retinoid (adapalene) were overall more effective than any of these interventions used as topical monotherapies, and this was the case for any severity of acne. The committee agreed that this was consistent with their clinical experience. The evidence also showed that a combination of 3 topical agents was less or similarly effective compared with a combination of any 2 agents, so triple therapy was not recommended\n【382】 - Topical treatments in combination with an oral tetracycline (either lymecycline or doxycycline) were recommended for moderate to severe acne, as the evidence indicated that oral tetracycline combined with a fixed combination of topical benzoyl peroxide and topical retinoid, and oral tetracycline with topical azelaic acid, were among the most clinically and cost-effective pharmacological options. The committee chose to recommend the option of azelaic acid combined with oral tetracycline because, despite its more limited evidence base, it was shown to be clinically and cost effective. It was therefore considered to be a good alternative for people who have irritation to topical retinoids, since all other options for moderate to severe acne contain a topical retinoid\n【383】 - The committee recommended either lymecycline or doxycycline because both are usually taken only once a day, which may improve adherence to the oral antibiotic treatment component compared to tetracycline and oxytetracycline which are taken twice a day. Lymecycline or doxycycline have a lower risk of side effects than minocycline (which may, for example, be associated with lupus erythematosus, hepatitis and pigmentation), and are preferred to oxytetracycline because they can be taken with food\n【384】 - Of the 5 options, 4 contain either a topical retinoid or oral tetracycline (lymecycline or doxycycline), so they should not be used during pregnancy. There was evidence that monotherapy with benzoyl peroxide was clinically and cost effective at any level of severity, albeit less so than the other 5 treatments recommended, and so this was recommended as an alternative for people when topical retinoids or oral tetracyclines are contraindicated (for example, for use during pregnancy). For people who have contraindications or who do not wish to use the treatment options in  or topical benzoyl peroxide, other treatments may be suibased on individual circumstances and clinical expertise\n【385】 - The committee also noted that some people with moderate to severe acne cannot tolerate, or have contraindications to, oral tetracyclines. These people would be at risk of complications if only topical treatment is used, so based on experience and expertise the committee recommended some alternatives that can be used\n【386】 - The committee noted that the evidence for some treatment options such as physical treatments, chemical peels and hormone-modifying treatments was limited, and therefore they made a research recommendation on the effectiveness of physical treatments (such as light devices) and on the effectiveness of chemical peels for the treatment of acne vulgaris or persistent acne vulgaris-related scarring\n【387】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\n【388】 - While the recommendations largely reflect current practice, the committee felt that treatment options including the advantages and disadvantages should be discussed with the person, which may mean additional resource use (for example, if longer or more consultations are needed). This will, however, likely lead to later benefits and reductions in resource use from better understanding and compliance with medication\n【389】 - The committee recognised that some currently available treatment options are not in the recommended list. The evidence related to this, and a detailed discussion of why some specific treatment options were not recommended, can be found in:\n E1: management options for mild to moderate acne – network meta-analyses\n F1: management options for moderate to severe acne – network meta-analyses\n E2: management options for mild to moderate acne – pairwise comparisons\n F2: management options for moderate to severe acne – pairwise comparisons\n【394】 -\n【395】 # Factors to take into account during consultations\n【396】 -\n【397】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\n【398】 - Based on experience and expertise the committee discussed that there were some general points that should be taken into account and discussed at consultation\n【399】 - The committee recognised that acne vulgaris can be the cause of psychological distress and agreed that this can be the case even if acne is mild. They decided to make a recommendation to raise the awareness of this so that the impact of acne on the person's psychological health will be taken into account during consultations\n【400】 - The committee also agreed that it is important to encourage adherence and therefore discuss the need for continued treatment with the person, because usually the positive effects of treatments only become visible after 6 to 8 weeks\n【401】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\n【402】 - Even though the recommendations are consistent with current practice, they emphasise psychological aspects and adhering to treatment regimens because both of these are important factors in the management of acne\n【403】 - Full details of the committee's discussion are in:\n D: referral to specialist care\n E1: management options for mild to moderate acne – network meta-analyses\n F1: management options for moderate to severe acne – network meta-analyses\n【407】 -\n【408】 # Factors to take into account when choosing a treatment option\n【409】 -\n【410】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\n【411】 - Based on their experience and expertise, as well as some evidence, the committee agreed that some factors related to treatments should be highlighted\n【412】 - The committee looked at evidence related to risk of scarring, which suggests that the severity and duration of acne may be risk factors for scarring. The committee noted that there is substantial uncertainty, as the studies did not control for the influence of other factors. However, they agreed that the risk factors were consistent with their knowledge and experience, so recommended that healthcare practitioners be made aware so that they can take this into account during discussions with the person\n【413】 - The evidence indicated that topical agents such as benzoyl peroxide and retinoids often cause skin irritation. Therefore, based on this and clinical experience, the committee recommended an initial alternate-day or short-contact application to help reduce skin irritation, and in doing so encourage adherence to treatment\n【414】 - Since some of the options include a topical retinoid or oral tetracyclines, the committee highlighted that these are contraindicated during pregnancy and when planning a pregnancy. Therefore use of effective contraception should be discussed with people with the potential to become pregnant\n【415】 - The committee discussed that in clinical practice it may be anticipated that oral isotretinoin treatment will be needed in future, for example based on severity. A healthcare professional may then want to choose a first-line option with an oral antibiotic, as this is a prerequisite for oral isotretinoin treatment and may also successfully treat the acne\n【416】 - The evidence showed lower clinical and cost effectiveness of oral antibiotics when used as monotherapy compared with the recommended treatment options in moderate to severe acne, and no clinical effectiveness in mild to moderate acne, and because of this as well as antibiotic stewardship the committee decided not to recommend oral antibiotics as monotherapy. They also agreed that combined topical antibiotics and oral antibiotics should not be used. There was no evidence on this, but based on experience and expertise the committee noted that such combinations are not used in current practice and agreed that without evidence this should not be introduced as an option\n【417】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\n【418】 - The advice related to antibiotics may lead to a significant change in clinical practice: currently, topical and oral antibiotics can be prescribed as long-term treatments for acne either as monotherapy or in combination with each other. The recommendation not to offer either of these forms of treatment should lead to lower antibiotic prescribing for acne, and reduce the risk of antimicrobial resistance\n and the committee's discussion are in:\n E1: management options for mild to moderate acne – network meta-analyses\n F1: management options for moderate to severe acne – network meta-analyses\n E2: management options for mild to moderate acne – pairwise comparisons\n F2: management options for moderate to severe acne – pairwise comparisons\n L: risk factors for scarring due to acne vulgaris\n【425】 -\n【426】 # Factors to take into account at review\n【427】 -\n【428】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\n【429】 - No evidence was identified for how long a treatment should be used. The committee agreed, based on their clinical experience, that first-line treatment should be continued for 12 weeks to determine if it is effective and to allow it to have the optimum effect, and then reviewed. The committee noted that an adequate response to treatment would be jointly determined by the healthcare professional and the person\n【430】 - The committee supported review at 12 weeks because their experience indicated people often stay on an ineffective treatment for too long, and having a review would prevent this. The committee also agreed that to help prevent the development of antimicrobial resistance, treatment with an oral antibiotic (as part of combined oral antibiotic and topical treatment) could be stopped at 12 weeks, while continuing with the topical treatment, if the person's acne is completely clear. If not completely cleared the antibiotic can be continued for up to a further 12 weeks (alongside the topical treatment)\n【431】 - There was a lack of evidence on the comparative effectiveness of antibiotic use according to different length of treatment times. Therefore, the committee used their knowledge and experience to recommend that treatments including topical or oral antibiotics should only last longer than 6 months in exceptional circumstances, with review at 3‑monthly intervals: the aim being to discontinue the antibiotic as soon as possible\n【432】 - The committee agreed that providing examples of exceptional circumstances would be of limited use, as these are rare and complex cases that should be assessed on an individual basis\n【433】 - The committee acknowledged that factors to take into account at review would also include discussions related to potential maintenance treatments. This would be relevant if acne has cleared, and so a cross referral was added to the maintenance section for further guidance on this\n【434】 - The committee noted that 6 months of antibiotic treatment is longer than the 12‑week course of antibiotic treatments that are currently commonly used. However, they decided that if the treatment is found to improve the acne at the 12‑week review it would be useful to continue. They also noted that recommendation 1.5.11 against antibiotic monotherapy and against combined topical antibiotic with an oral antibiotic treatment would lead to substantially lower prescribing of antibiotic treatments for acne vulgaris overall\n【435】 - The committee also took into account the principles of antimicrobial guidance and policy, as outlined in the NICE guideline on antimicrobial stewardship, as well as the World Health Organization Global action plan on antimicrobial resistance. All of these antibiotic treatments increase the risk of antimicrobial resistance, and the committee noted that healthcare professionals should be aware of the principles of antimicrobial stewardship when considering treatments for acne\n【436】 - No evidence was identified for the best further treatment option when there has been no or only a partial response at review\n【437】 - The committee therefore agreed that inadequate response to treatment should be dealt with in a stepwise approach, taking into account the number of treatment courses and severity of acne after the first treatment. If mild to moderate acne fails to respond to a 12‑week course of a topical first-line treatment, the committee decided that another option should be offered. For unresponsive moderate to severe acne, further treatment depends on whether or not the first choice was an option that contained an oral antibiotic. If it did not then this should be considered next, but if the option included an oral antibiotic then referral to a consultant dermatologist-led team can be considered. The committee discussed that in these cases a timely referral could prevent scarring\n【438】 - When mild to moderate acne vulgaris fails to respond to a second 12‑week course of treatment, the committee agreed that the person should be referred to a consultant dermatologist-led team rather than continuing courses of treatment in primary care\n【439】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\n【440】 - The recommendation of 12‑week review and a maximum 6‑month duration of antibiotic treatment for most people will lead to standardisation of practice, reducing repeated long-term antibiotic prescription and the risk of antimicrobial resistance. This in turn may result in positive associated cost savings and improved clinical outcomes. With regard to further treatment when there was no or only partial improvement, the committee noted that these recommendations are consistent with other parts of the guideline and therefore will help standardise practice\n and the committee's discussion are in:\n E1: management options for mild to moderate acne – network meta-analyses\n F1: management options for moderate to severe acne – network meta-analyses\n E2: management options for mild to moderate acne – pairwise comparisons\n F2: management options for moderate to severe acne – pairwise comparisons\n H: management options for refractory acne\n【447】 -\n【448】 # Oral isotretinoin treatment\n【449】 -\n【450】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\n【451】 - The committee noted that the evidence on this topic was uncertain because of the small number of participants, and agreed that results should be interpreted with some caution. The evidence indicated that oral isotretinoin was an effective and cost-effective treatment for moderate to severe acne. However, taking into account the MHRA safety advice on isotretinoin for severe acne: uses and effects, and specifically the possibility of psychiatric side effects, the committee recommended oral isotretinoin only in situations when they agreed the benefits outweighed the risks\n【452】 - The committee noted the need to follow MHRA guidance before oral isotretinoin is started, and to ensure that those who are taking it are advised about the important safety issues associated with this medicine, and are monitored as needed. They also emphasised that when starting oral isotretinoin, people of childbearing potential have to use contraception and need to follow the recommended MHRA pregnancy prevention programme\n【453】 - The committee noted from the evidence that results were almost exclusively derived from trials testing oral isotretinoin in dosages of at least 0.5 mg/kg/day, and that total cumulative doses of at least 120 mg/kg in a single course were more effective compared with total cumulative doses lower than 120 mg/kg in a single course. After reviewing the evidence, and based on their clinical experience, the committee decided to recommend a standard daily dose of 0.5 to 1 mg/kg. Based on expertise and clinical experience, the committee agreed that people who have an intolerance or are at risk of significant adverse effects may need a reduced daily dose of oral isotretinoin. The committee discussed that the risk of adverse events is multifactorial, and so assessment of risk would be dependent on the person's circumstances and could not be quantified as part of the recommendation\n【454】 - The evidence suggested that a cumulative dose of 120 to 150 mg/kg is effective, but it was known from the committee's experience that sometimes an adequate response with skin clearance can occur before this has been reached. They decided after balancing the potential adverse events and effectiveness, that for some people (based on clinical judgement), treatment can be complete before a total cumulative dose of 120 to 150 mg/kg is reached if there is sustained clear skin for 4 to 8 weeks\n【455】 - When people take oral isotretinoin the committee emphasised, because of MHRA safety concerns, that their psychological wellbeing has to be reviewed and monitored, and that people need to know that it is important to seek help if they need it\n【456】 - The committee noted that the evidence for lower dose oral isotretinoin was scarce, and therefore prioritised this for a research recommendation on the efficacy of reduced dose oral isotretinoin in the management of acne vulgaris\n【457】 - May 2023: the recommendations on oral isotretinoin have been amended in line with new MHRA guidance\n【458】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\n【459】 - The recommendations reinforce current practice and MHRA guidance. There may be additional resource use, for example, referral to mental health services or if longer or more consultations are needed. This will likely to lead to later benefits and cost savings, with reduction in potential adverse outcomes and shorter overall duration of treatment\n F2: management options for moderate to severe acne – pairwise comparisons\n【461】 -\n【462】 # Use of oral corticosteroids in addition to oral isotretinoin\n【463】 -\n【464】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\n【465】 - No evidence was found on this topic, so the committee made recommendations based on their clinical knowledge and experience\n【466】 - The committee noted that oral corticosteroid can be used to treat acne flare occurring after the start of treatment with oral isotretinoin, and that this would apply to anyone on oral isotretinoin and not just people with acne fulminans\n【467】 - The committee also agreed that it is known that oral isotretinoin may cause acne flare, so it is accepted practice to also give oral corticosteroids to people with acne fulminans who are starting oral isotretinoin to prevent an acne flare from occurring\n【468】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\n【469】 - The recommendation aims to standardise the use of oral corticosteroids in addition to oral isotretinoin when treating acne fulminans. This reflects current clinical practice and is not likely to have resource implications\n J: addition of oral corticosteroids to oral isotretinoin for the treatment of severe inflammatory acne vulgaris\n【471】 -\n【472】 # Physical treatments\n【473】 - \n【474】 ## Why the committee made the recommendation\n【475】 - Based on modest evidence that photodynamic therapy is moderately clinically and cost effective in the treatment of moderate to severe acne vulgaris compared with other treatments, the committee decided that it could be recommended as an alternative for treating this severity of acne when other treatments are ineffective, not tolerated or contraindicated. The evidence for physical treatments for mild to moderate acne was very limited. Therefore, the committee noted that the use of photodynamic therapy would depend upon the consultant dermatologist's clinical expertise and judgement on a case-by-case basis\n【476】 - Because of the limited evidence, the committee decided to prioritise a research recommendation on the effectiveness of physical treatments (such as light devices) in the treatment of acne vulgaris or persistent acne vulgaris-related scarring\n【477】 ## How the recommendation might affect practice\n【478】 - Physical treatments for the management of acne are not part of current practice in the NHS. Therefore, the recommendation is expected to result in a change in current practice and to have some impact on resources and training. The impact is not expected to be substantial, as many hospitals across the country already have photodynamic therapy facilities and the proportion of people with acne fulfilling the criteria is not expected to be high\n and the committee's discussion are in:\n F1: management options for moderate to severe acne – network meta-analyses\n F2: management options for moderate to severe acne – pairwise comparisons\n M: management of acne-vulgaris-associated scarring\n【483】 - \n【484】 # Use of intralesional corticosteroids\n【485】 - \n【486】 ## Why the committee made the recommendation\n【487】 - Severe inflammatory acne vulgaris cysts can be painful and unsightly, so even though the evidence was limited the committee agreed it was important to make a recommendation on this based on their knowledge and experience together with the available evidence\n【488】 - From the limited evidence there were sufficiently positive results to recommend the use of intralesional triamcinolone acetonide, which agreed with the committee's experience. The committee chose to recommend a concentration of 0.6 mg/ml as this is in line with the effective concentrations used in the available evidence\n【489】 - The committee also discussed that there are some possible side effects of triamcinolone acetonide injections, for example hypopigmentation (especially in people with darker skin). Because of this, the committee recommended a lower dose than is used for other inflammatory conditions, noting that the recommended dose is small and is less likely to cause side effects. The committee also agreed that, usually, inflammatory acne cysts respond well to low concentrations of triamcinolone acetonide, so the higher doses often used for other treatments are not needed\n【490】 ## How the recommendation might affect practice\n【491】 - At present there is variation in the use of intralesional corticosteroids for people with inflammatory cysts, in terms of indication, time point and dosage. The recommendation aims to standardise practice and is likely to have a low impact on resources as intralesional corticosteroids are readily available and the procedure can be done during the clinic consultation\n K: intralesional corticosteroids for the treatment of individual acne vulgaris lesions\n【493】 - \n【494】 # Treatment options for people with polycystic ovary syndrome\n【495】 -\n【496】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\n【497】 - There was insufficient evidence to identify the most effective treatment for acne vulgaris in people with polycystic ovary syndrome, so the committee agreed that the usual first-line treatment options are appropriate in the first instance. This enables treatment for acne in people with polycystic ovary syndrome to be started without delay\n【498】 - If the first-line treatment options do not work, adding a hormonal treatment could be effective because of hyperandrogenism in people with polycystic ovary syndrome. The committee agreed that either the combined oral contraceptive pill (which is an established and widely available hormonal treatment for the symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome) or ethinylestradiol with cyproterone acetate (co-cyprindiol) could be used, as they have different mechanisms of action from one another. The committee agreed that a 6‑month review for co-cyprindiol should take place to discuss the benefits and risks of continuing the treatment or the use of an alternative option\n【499】 - The committee also agreed that the standard first-line treatment options as well as the combined contraceptive pill or co-cyprindiol could be delivered in primary care, but some people with acne vulgaris and polycystic ovary syndrome who have additional features of hyperandrogenism would need more specialist treatment and may benefit from referral to a specialist, such as a reproductive endocrinologist\n【500】 - Because of the insufficient evidence for this review the committee prioritised a research recommendation on the most effective first-line treatment option for any severity of acne vulgaris for people with polycystic ovary syndrome\n【501】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\n【502】 - The committee considered that the recommendations largely reflect current practice, although there may be an increase in the use of first-line treatment options instead of hormonal treatments as initial care for acne in people with polycystic ovary syndrome which could be cost saving\n G: management options for people with acne vulgaris and polycystic ovary syndrome\n【504】 -\n【505】 # Relapse\n【506】 -\n【507】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\n【508】 - No evidence was identified, so the recommendations were based on the committee's experience and expertise. The committee agreed that relapse after treatment should be dealt with in a stepwise approach, taking into account the number of treatment courses and severity of acne at the time of relapse\n【509】 - For people with acne that relapses after adequate response to first-line treatment, the committee agreed either the same treatment should be tried again if it was well tolerated and the person was happy with the outcome, or a different option could be tried if preferred\n【510】 - In a situation when acne has adequately responded to oral isotretinoin but has relapsed to mild to moderate severity, the committee recommended offering a new 12‑week course of one of the first-line treatments for mild to moderate severity. This would most likely achieve adequate results while avoiding the side effects of oral antibiotics or another course of oral isotretinoin\n【511】 - In a situation when acne has adequately responded to oral isotretinoin but has relapsed to moderate to severe severity, the committee agreed to recommend 2 options: either a new 12‑week course of one of the first-line treatment options, as this may adequately treat the relapse, or re-referral to a consultant dermatologist-led team for alternative treatment options (which may include a further course of isotretinoin)\n【512】 - The committee agreed that people whose acne vulgaris has relapsed after treatment with 2 separate courses of oral isotretinoin, and who currently have moderate to severe acne, should be offered a re-referral if they are no longer under the care of a consultant dermatologist-led team. They discussed that these people may need a tailored approach to their acne treatment, including a change in dose or duration of oral isotretinoin or other alternative treatment options\n【513】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\n【514】 - The committee noted that these recommendations are consistent with other parts of the guideline and therefore will help standardise practice. They acknowledged that referral of a person to a consultant dermatologist-led team after acne vulgaris relapsed twice with 2 separate courses of oral isotretinoin, may lead to a change in current clinical practice. However, they agreed that this approach will lead to better outcomes because it is using a specialist tailored approach to treatment\n H: management options for refractory acne\n【516】 -\n【517】 # Maintenance\n【518】 -\n【519】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\n【520】 - There was some evidence on this topic, and the committee used this together with their experience and expertise to make recommendations\n【521】 - The committee noted that appropriate skin care, as described in section 1.2, should be encouraged to maintain the skin improvements achieved by acne treatment\n【522】 - The committee discussed that people whose acne has cleared are often concerned that not having further treatment will mean their acne will relapse, which is often not the case. The committee therefore recommended that healthcare professionals should explain that maintenance treatment is not always needed\n【523】 - Based on clinical experience, the group that the committee thought may benefit from maintenance treatment were those whose acne had previously returned after treatment\n【524】 - There was some evidence of limited quality suggesting that topical retinoids such as adapalene and tretinoin, topical benzoyl peroxide or topical azelaic acid, could reduce lesion count with few adverse effects for maintenance treatment. The committee agreed that the combination treatment of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide demonstrated the best clinical effect, but discussed that other options should be available for those who have contraindications or who are unable to tolerate the treatment. They agreed that topical adapalene, topical azelaic acid or topical benzoyl peroxide could be used\n【525】 - Based on experience, the committee agreed that a 12‑week review was suito decide whether or not continued maintenance treatment is necessary because by 12 weeks any effects of the maintenance treatments should have become apparent\n【526】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\n【527】 - Although the recommendations do not largely deviate from current practice, there is currently variation on what types of maintenance treatments are given. The recommendations would therefore standardise practice\n I: maintenance treatment for acne vulgaris\n【529】 -\n【530】 # Managing acne-related scarring\n【531】 -\n【532】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\n【533】 - A considerable amount of evidence was identified on this topic. However, the types of comparisons made interpretation of the effectiveness of treatments difficult. The committee acknowledged that any treatment should be preceded by a discussion of treatment options (for ongoing acne as well as acne-associated scarring) and other issues relevant to the person, to help with shared decision making. The committee noted that referral to a consultant dermatologist-led team with expertise in the management of scarring is important to prevent potential skin damage caused by treatment. They were aware that the evidence was not strong enough to recommend referral for everyone with acne scarring, which would also lead to a significant impact on resources. The committee therefore specified, based on the available evidence and clinical expertise, that those with persistent severe scarring are likely to have the greatest benefit. The committee discussed that in their experience, the tissue remodelling and healing process occurs for up to about a year after the acne has cleared and management of acne scarring should be considered after this timeframe\n【534】 - There was evidence that 3 types of treatment showed some efficacy in improving the appearance of scars. These were glycolic acid peels, or CO2 laser treatment either alone or after a session of punch elevation. The choice of option would depend on the type of scarring, but the committee chose to allow for clinical judgement as people may present with a number of different types of scars\n【535】 - Additionally, the committee agreed that the uncertainties in the evidence needed further research to clarify. The committee therefore prioritised recommendations for research on the effectiveness of physical treatments (such as light devices) and on the effectiveness of chemical peels for the treatment of acne vulgaris or persistent acne vulgaris-related scarring\n【536】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\n【537】 - The availability of treatments for acne scarring in NHS centres varies across the country. The recommendations are expected to result in a change in current practice, with referral to a consultant dermatologist-led team and standardised options of glycolic acid peel or CO2 laser treatment with punch elevation where needed. The impact is not expected to be substantive, as only a small number of people will fulfil the criteria. Additional resources and training may be needed in centres offering these treatment options\n L: risk factors for scarring due to acne vulgaris\n【539】 - # Context\n【540】 - Acne vulgaris is a common condition that can affect the face, chest and back. It is most prevalent among young people and younger adults, affecting approximately 80% of people at some time between 11 and 30 years\n【541】 - When treating acne vulgaris its severity, distribution, and the views of the affected person need to be taken into account. The aim of treatment is to reduce the severity of skin lesions and to prevent recurrence and scarring\n【542】 - There is variation in how acne vulgaris is treated in clinical practice, and there is therefore a need to standardise treatment. There is also a need when prescribing antibiotic therapy for acne vulgaris to take into account the principles of antimicrobial guidance and policy, as outlined in the NICE guideline on antimicrobial stewardship, as well as the World Health Organization Global action plan on antimicrobial resistance", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": "多余换行#0#542#全文存在多处多余换行", "type3": null, "type4": "语义不完整#0#542#全文多处存在缺少内容情况", "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-15 17:51:31", "update_time": "2024-04-15 23:16:23"}

Treatment should be under the conditions specified in recommendation 1.5.5 in the NICE guideline on dementia\n【7】 - This recommendation has been updated and replaced by recommendation 1.5.5 in the NICE guideline on dementia\n【8】 - If prescribing an AChE inhibitor (donepezil, galantamine or rivastigmine), treatment should normally be started with the drug with the lowest acquisition cost (taking into account required daily dose and the price per dose once shared care has started). However, an alternative AChE inhibitor could be prescribed if it is considered appropriate when taking into account adverse event profile, expectations about adherence, medical comorbidity, possibility of drug interactions and dosing profiles\n【9】 - When using assessment scales to determine the severity of Alzheimer's disease, healthcare professionals should take into account any physical, sensory or learning disabilities, or communication difficulties that could affect the results and make any adjustments they consider appropriate. Healthcare professionals should also be mindful of the need to secure equality of access to treatment for patients from different ethnic groups, in particular those from different cultural backgrounds\n【10】 - When assessing the severity of Alzheimer's disease and the need for treatment, healthcare professionals should not rely solely on cognition scores in circumstances in which it would be inappropriate to do so. These include:\n【11】 - if the cognition score is not, or is not by itself, a clinically appropriate tool for assessing the severity of that patient's dementia because of the patient's learning difficulties or other disabilities (for example, sensory impairments), linguistic or other communication difficulties or level of education or\n【12】 - if it is not possible to apply the tool in a language in which the patient is sufficiently fluent for it to be appropriate for assessing the severity of dementia or\n【13】 - if there are other similar reasons why using a cognition score, or the score alone, would be inappropriate for assessing the severity of dementia.In such cases healthcare professionals should determine the need for initiation or continuation of treatment by using another appropriate method of assessment.# Clinical need and practice\n【14】 - Dementia is a chronic progressive mental disorder that adversely affects higher cortical functions including memory, thinking, orientation, comprehension, calculation, learning capacity, language and judgement. Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia. It is a degenerative cerebral disease with characteristic neuropathological and neurochemical features\n【15】 - Population data from 2005 indicate that 380,000 people have Alzheimer's disease in England and Wales. The UK incidence of Alzheimer's disease in people over the age of 65 years is estimated to be 4.9 per 1000 person-years. Between 50 and 64% of people with Alzheimer's disease are estimated to have mild to moderately severe disease, and approximately 50% have moderately severe to severe disease\n【16】 - Alzheimer's disease is usually insidious in onset and develops slowly but steadily over several years. It predominantly affects older people. The median survival for people with Alzheimer's disease from onset has been estimated at 7 years, although survival s vary and depend on how they are measured, comorbidities, age (median survival decreases with increasing age) and sex\n【17】 - Progression is characterised by deterioration in cognition (for example, thinking, conceiving and reasoning), functional ability (for example, activities of daily living such as dressing, personal hygiene and handling money), behaviour (for example, agitation, wandering and uncharacteristic aggression) and non-cognitive symptoms including depression, delusions and hallucinations. People with Alzheimer's disease might find it increasingly difficult to do everyday activities, such as shopping, socialising and recognising people and places. Communication may become a problem as people find it more difficult to find words and remember names. In later stages of disease, physical problems can include problems with eating, swallowing, incontinence, and unsettled and unsettling behaviour. Alzheimer's disease may also be associated with loss of confidence and feelings of fear, confusion, apathy, stigma and depression. The effects of Alzheimer's disease are heterogeneous and vary from patient to patient\n【18】 - Alzheimer's disease has many impacts including physical, mental, nursing, medical and social impacts. Carers (including friends and family) are affected by the progressive deterioration in cognition, function and behaviour of a person with Alzheimer's disease. Behavioural symptoms can have a particular impact on carers, and are often the reason cited for a person with Alzheimer's disease going into full-time residential care. Alzheimer's disease can have a profound and far-reaching effect on family and carers as well as the patient including institutionalisation and a financial impact on family, carers and the state\n【19】 - The severity of Alzheimer's disease can be assessed using several methods, depending on the setting (for example research or clinical practice) and the outcome being assessed. Clinical practice uses a variety of measures, often along with clinically based assessments such as biographical interview. Severity is frequently defined by Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score:\n【20】 - mild Alzheimer's disease: MMSE 21–26\n【21】 - moderate Alzheimer's disease: MMSE 10–20\n【22】 - moderately severe Alzheimer's disease: MMSE 10–14\n【23】 - severe Alzheimer's disease: MMSE less than 10\n【24】 - The aims of treatment are to promote independence, maintain function and treat symptoms including cognitive, non-cognitive (hallucinations, delusions, anxiety, marked agitation and associated aggressive behaviour), behavioural and psychological symptoms\n【25】 - There is no cure for Alzheimer's disease. Current management involves the treatment of cognitive, non-cognitive and behavioural symptoms. AChE inhibitors (donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine) and memantine are the pharmacological treatments available specifically for Alzheimer's disease. Non-pharmacological treatment includes social support, increasing assistance with day-to-day activities, information and education, carer support groups, community dementia teams, home nursing and personal care, community services such as meals-on-wheels, befriending services, day centres, respite care and care homes.# The technologies\n【26】 # Donepezil\n【27】 - Donepezil (Aricept, Eisai/Pfizer) is an AChE inhibitor, which works by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine at sites of neurotransmission.

Costs may vary in different settings because of negotiated procurement discounts.# Evidence and interpretation\n【41】 - The Appraisal Committee (appendix A) considered evidence from a number of sources (appendix B)\n【42】 # Clinical effectiveness\n【43】 - The Committee considered evidence from the Assessment Group, submissions from the manufacturers of donepezil, galantamine and memantine, the Alzheimer's Society, the Royal College of Psychiatrists, the British Geriatrics Society, clinical specialists and patient experts\n【44】 - The Assessment Group conducted a systematic review of randomised controlled trials published since 2004 and those included in 'Donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine (review) and memantine for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (amended)' (NICE technology appraisal guidance 111). The Assessment Group reviewed the clinical effectiveness of donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine and memantine in accordance with their marketing authorisations. For the population with mild Alzheimer's disease (defined as MMSE 21–26) the AChE inhibitors (donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine) were compared with each other and with best supportive care (that is, without treatment with any AChE inhibitors or memantine). For the population with moderate Alzheimer's disease (MMSE 10–20) the AChE inhibitors and memantine were compared with each other and with best supportive care. For the population with severe Alzheimer's disease (MMSE less than 10) memantine was compared with best supportive care. The Assessment Group considered cognition, function, behaviour, global outcomes, mortality, institutionalisation, health-related quality of life and adverse effects. If possible, new evidence was pooled with the evidence from before 2004 using random effects meta-analysis compared with placebo. The effectiveness of treatments across different outcome measures was also explored in a pooled multiple outcome measure analysis to explore the characteristics of the evidence base. If data were sufficient, the Assessment Group pooled information on all technologies and their comparators in a mixed treatment comparison, using Bayesian Markov Chain Monte-Carlo sampling\n【45】 ## Mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease\n【46】 - The Assessment Group included five new placebo-controlled comparisons of donepezil. The manufacturer of donepezil included new data from three randomised controlled trials, one subanalysis of a randomised controlled trial, two prospective longitudinal studies and three observational studies, six subgroup analyses and four meta-analyses (two systematic reviews and two pooled analyses), in addition to data previously submitted\n【47】 - For donepezil, the Assessment Group found no new studies reporting the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale – cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) at 12 or 24 weeks or MMSE at 12 weeks. The effectiveness estimates using these scales were therefore based on the studies included in NICE technology appraisal guidance 111. One new study was found that measured the effect of donepezil on cognition at 24 weeks follow-up. The overall pooled benefit using new and old data was significant on all scales (a mean change from baseline versus placebo of 1.165  and 1.206  at 12 and 24 weeks respectively using MMSE score, and −1.969  and −2.895  at 12 and 24 weeks respectively using ADAS-cog score) and the standardised mean difference of pooled outcomes increased with time for ADAS-cog. According to the manufacturer of donepezil, all 12 randomised controlled trials (from NICE technology appraisal guidance 111 and new submissions that reported on cognition using the ADAS-cog, MMSE or Severe Impairment Battery  scales) showed a statistically significant difference favouring donepezil versus placebo, with four of these reporting a statistically significant difference on two different cognitive scales\n【48】 - One randomised controlled trial, described by the Assessment Group as being poorly reported, measured functional outcomes for donepezil. At 12 weeks follow-up, this trial showed a statistically significant benefit from donepezil (5 mg/day) for activities of daily living in an observed cases measured population. The heterogeneous collection of outcome measures prevented any quantitative synthesis of old and new evidence for individual measures since 2004. The pooled multiple outcome measure analysis for functional outcome data from the studies in NICE technology appraisal guidance 111 showed a statistically significant benefit for donepezil at all doses compared with placebo at 24 weeks - a mean change from baseline versus placebo of 0.298 (p < 0.001, no new data available). According to the manufacturer of donepezil, four randomised controlled trials showed a statistically significant difference favouring donepezil versus placebo on at least one scale and three reported non-significant trends in favour of donepezil. Additionally, the manufacturer cited a meta-analysis of seven randomised controlled trials of donepezil reporting a statistically significant benefit favouring donepezil versus placebo\n【49】 - None of the studies for donepezil newly identified by the Assessment Group provided additional data for behavioural function, so the results were based on studies included in NICE technology appraisal guidance 111, which noted no statistically significant benefit from donepezil compared with placebo at 12 or 24 weeks measured with the neuropsychiatric inventory (NPI). There were mean changes from baseline versus placebo of −2.249 (p = 0.123) and −3.116 (p = 0.226) at 12 and 24 weeks respectively using NPI. According to the manufacturer of donepezil, three randomised controlled trials found a statistically significant difference between donepezil and placebo in NPI score, with a fourth study finding a statistically significant difference for agitation or aggression but not total score. The manufacturer of donepezil also referred to six pooled studies that showed a statistically significant difference in favour of donepezil in NPI total score compared with placebo\n【50】 - One of the new studies included by the Assessment Group measured global outcomes for donepezil and reported a statistically significant benefit on the clinical dementia rating (CDR). All of the evidence on the Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change (CIBIC)-plus was based on NICE technology appraisal guidance 111. A meta-analysis of the effectiveness of donepezil for the CIBIC-plus reported a statistically significant benefit of donepezil 10 mg/day compared with placebo at 12 and 24 weeks. The Assessment Group did not find any new studies that measured global outcomes at 24–26 weeks. The pooled multiple outcome measure analysis for the global outcome data from the studies in NICE technology appraisal guidance 111 showed a statistically significant benefit for donepezil at all doses compared with placebo at 24–26 weeks (a mean change from baseline versus placebo of −0.377  and −0.429  at 12 and 24 weeks respectively using CIBIC-plus score, and −0.263  and −0.568  at 12 and 24 weeks respectively using CDR score). According to the manufacturer of donepezil, global function (CIBIC-plus, CDR sum of boxes  or the Gottfries, Brine and Steen scale ) was measured in nine of the studies presented in new and previous submissions with statistically significant results in favour of donepezil in seven of them. A submitted meta-analysis of ten trials also showed significant improvement in global function compared with placebo using the CDR-SB\n【51】 - According to the Assessment Group, none of the five newly identified studies for donepezil provided data on adverse events observed under randomised conditions except for limited data from one study. The manufacturer also presented safety data. In summary, the manufacturer of donepezil stated that new data since 2004 was consistent with that previously submitted\n【52】 - The Assessment Group noted that none of the new randomised controlled trials included in the assessment report provided any additional data on quality of life, time to institutionalisation or mortality with donepezil\n【53】 - The manufacturer of donepezil included prospective longitudinal and observational studies to support the view that cognitive benefits from donepezil are maintained for up to 3 years. The submission also included new data from a placebo-controlled trial of at least a 2-year duration and a subanalysis of a previous placebo-controlled study of 1 year duration. The manufacturer also presented evidence from randomised and non-randomised controlled trials to demonstrate that benefit was lost when treatment was stopped, the benefits of continuing treatment despite initial decline or stabilisation of MMSE, and the impact of improvement of neuropsychiatric symptoms on caregiver stress and burden\n【54】 - The manufacturer of donepezil included evidence that patients showing clinical worsening may benefit from treatment compared with those on placebo or who were untreated. The manufacturer also included a responder analysis that showed how results varied depending on the definition of response. The manufacturer used these data to demonstrate the effects of treatment on carers\n【55】 - A representative from the manufacturer of donepezil informed the Committee that an analysis of a single open-label study found an average of 17.5 months delay in the time to institutionalisation with donepezil treatment. Survival data were not collected in any of the trials because follow-up periods were short and therefore there were few deaths during trials\n【56】 - The Assessment Group included three new randomised controlled trials of galantamine. The manufacturer of galantamine submitted data from before and after 2004 for six trials and four pooled analyses including mild, moderate and 'advanced moderate' subgroups\n【57】 - All three studies included by the Assessment Group measured cognition and used ADAS-cog at various points between 6 and 26 weeks and showed improvement with galantamine compared with placebo. When the results of these were added to the results of NICE technology appraisal guidance 111, the pooled estimate demonstrated a statistically significant benefit of galantamine compared with placebo, which increased with time (mean changes from baseline versus placebo of −2.386  and −2.957  at 12–16 and 21–26 weeks respectively using ADAS-cog score). According to the manufacturer of galantamine, established randomised controlled trial data from five placebo-controlled trials in mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease showed statistically significant benefit in ADAS-cog score. This was reflected in the pooled data that included a subgroup of patients with additional cerebrovascular disease from a trial of patients with Alzheimer's disease (other patients in the trial had probable vascular dementia)\n【58】 - The Assessment Group found three new randomised controlled trials measuring functional outcomes for galantamine. The Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study – Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL) data from the new trials were pooled with those of the studies found in 2004, and the overall pooled estimates showed statistically significant functional benefit from galantamine compared with placebo at 21–26 weeks (mean changes from baseline versus placebo of 1.394  and 2.234  at 12–13 and 21–26 weeks respectively). The results of Disability Assessment for Dementia (DAD) score were pooled at 21­26 weeks follow-up. Again this showed a statistically significant benefit of galantamine compared with placebo (mean changes from baseline versus placebo of 3.761  at 21–26 weeks). Two new studies were added to the meta-analysis of combined functional outcome measures at 21–26 weeks. The pooled multiple outcome measure analysis showed a statistically significant functional benefit of galantamine compared with placebo. The manufacturer referred to four established placebo-controlled randomised controlled trials that showed benefits in terms of ADCS-ADL or DAD score, of which some were statistically significant, including the pooled data (which included a subgroup of patients with additional cerebrovascular disease from another trial)\n【59】 - Only one study included by the Assessment Group provided additional data for the effectiveness of galantamine in relieving behavioural symptoms, when compared with placebo. However, this did not show any statistically significant benefit. When the new data were pooled with previous data, at 13 weeks no significant benefit was found, but at 21–26 weeks the overall pooled estimate favoured galantamine significantly (mean changes from baseline versus placebo of −0.746  and −1.455  at 13 and 21–26 weeks respectively using NPI score). The manufacturer of galantamine referred to one study that showed statistically significant benefits in terms of NPI score, and another two placebo-controlled trials that showed non-significant benefits in terms of NPI score. Mixed results were reflected in the pooled data (including the subgroup of patients with additional cerebrovascular disease from another trial)\n【60】 - Two new studies found by the Assessment Group measured global outcomes for galantamine. One found a significant benefit from galantamine measured by the CIBIC-plus compared with placebo at 13–16 weeks. When the new studies' data were pooled with existing evidence, the overall pooled estimates of the CIBIC-plus at 26 weeks showed a statistically significant benefit from galantamine compared with placebo (a mean change from baseline versus placebo of ­0.196  at 26 weeks). According to the manufacturer of galantamine, established randomised controlled trial data showed that in four out of five placebo-controlled trials in people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease, statistically significant benefits of galantamine were seen with CIBIC-plus. This statistically significant benefit was reflected in the pooled data (including the subgroup of patients with additional cerebrovascular disease from another trial)\n【61】 - The Assessment Group noted that none of the new randomised controlled trials included in the assessment report provided any additional data on quality of life, time to institutionalisation or mortality with galantamine\n【62】 - According to the Assessment Group, overall for galantamine in two new studies, there was a high percentage of any adverse event in both studies in treatment and control groups (any adverse events: treatment = 79–84%, placebo = 62–70%). The manufacturer of galantamine did not present any new data on toxicity\n【63】 - The Assessment Group included a systematic review, including a meta-analysis, that concluded that the AChE inhibitors provided benefits in terms of cognitive function and activities of daily living, and galantamine improved psychological symptoms in mild to moderate dementia\n【64】 - The Assessment Group included three new randomised placebo-controlled comparisons of rivastigmine. No data were submitted by the manufacturer of rivastigmine\n【65】 - Three new studies for rivastigmine were identified by the Assessment Group that measured cognition using ADAS-cog and/or MMSE and showed significant benefit (patch and capsule were not differentiated). When the results of these were added to the randomised controlled trials in NICE technology appraisal guidance 111, it demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in cognition with rivastigmine compared with placebo at 24–26 weeks (mean changes from baseline versus placebo of 1.022  using MMSE score and −2.464  using ADAS-cog score)\n【66】 - Two of the three new studies found by the Assessment Group published since 2004 reported statistically significant functional benefit from rivastigmine compared with placebo. These used the Progressive Deterioration Scale (PDS) and ADCS-ADL as outcome measures. The overall pooled estimate using the new and previous data for PDS at 24–26 weeks showed a statistically significant benefit of rivastigmine compared with placebo (a mean change from baseline versus placebo of 3.103  at 24–26 weeks using PDS score). Two new studies were found to add to the pooled multiple outcome measure analysis of functional outcomes at 24–26 weeks, which showed a statistically significant benefit from rivastigmine compared with placebo\n【67】 - Two new studies were found that measured behavioural outcomes with rivastigmine. One small study found a statistically significant benefit from rivastigmine. The other, much larger, study did not. The Assessment Group stated that the data identified by this review and NICE technology appraisal guidance 111 are sparse and too heterogeneous to permit meaningful quantitative synthesis\n【68】 - The two new studies in this comparison that reported global outcomes had conflicting results. One found mostly significantly favourable results with the CIBIC-plus and the Global Deterioration Scale (GDS), but the other did not. Data from the new studies were pooled with the existing evidence in a random-effects meta-analysis using the CIBIC-plus and the GDS at 26 weeks. The meta-analysis showed a statistically significant benefit from rivastigmine at 26 weeks (mean changes from baseline versus placebo of 0.420  using CIBIC-plus score and 0.196  using GDS score). The pooled multiple outcome measure analysis showed an overall statistically significant benefit for rivastigmine compared with placebo\n【69】 - The Assessment Group noted that none of the new randomised controlled trials included in the assessment report provided any additional data on quality of life, time to institutionalisation or mortality with rivastigmine\n【70】 - According to the Assessment Group, for rivastigmine, overall there was a high percentage of any adverse events, ranging from 51% to 91% in the treatment groups, and 46% to 76% in control groups. The main adverse events were gastrointestinal. The 9.5 mg/day transdermal patch produced fewer side effects than the capsule (12 mg/day)\n【71】 - The Assessment Group included a Cochrane review that concluded that high doses of rivastigmine offered statistically significant benefits in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease versus placebo\n【72】 - The Assessment Group identified four head-to-head randomised controlled trials (two comparing all three AChE inhibitors, one comparing donepezil with rivastigmine and one comparing donepezil with galantamine) but considered only one of the studies to be of sufficiently high quality to inform this review. The included study (which compared donepezil with rivastigmine) noted that over 2 years there was no statistically significant difference between rivastigmine and donepezil for cognitive outcomes (MMSE and SIB). Patients taking rivastigmine had significantly improved outcomes than those taking donepezil in the primary analysis of functional outcomes (p = 0.007–0.047). No significant difference was seen between donepezil and rivastigmine for behavioural outcomes (NPI). The study showed that patients taking rivastigmine did significantly better than those taking donepezil in terms of global outcomes (GDS). However, the manufacturer of donepezil stated that this study did not meet its primary endpoint and showed higher discontinuations and higher rates of some adverse events for rivastigmine compared with donepezil. None of the newly identified, head-to-head, randomised studies investigated quality of life with the technologies under assessment, and no such data were identified in NICE technology appraisal guidance 111. The most common adverse effects reported in the head-to-head studies of the AChE inhibitors were nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting and headache\n【73】 - If data were sufficient, the Assessment Group pooled information on all technologies and their comparators simultaneously in a mixed treatment comparison, using Bayesian Markov Chain Monte-Carlo sampling, which showed the probability of each treatment being the most clinically effective. The results of the mixed treatment comparison varied depending on the symptom assessed, the instrument used and follow-up time. The Assessment Group included a systematic review, including a meta-analysis, that concluded that the AChE inhibitors provided benefits in terms of cognitive function and activities of daily living, and galantamine improved psychological symptoms in mild to moderate dementia. Another concluded that for the AChE inhibitors and memantine there was a small effect size in mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease\n【74】 ## Moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease\n【75】 - The Assessment Group found one new randomised controlled trial for memantine monotherapy versus placebo. The manufacturer of memantine submitted estimates of clinical effectiveness for the general population with moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease and a subgroup of patients with agitation, aggression and/or psychotic symptoms. The manufacturer submitted a meta-analysis that had used individual patient data from six 6-month randomised controlled trials. The first three trials were in moderately severe to severe disease and the other three were in mild to moderate disease. The Assessment Group had excluded trials in which at least 20% of the study participants had mild disease because this was outside the marketing authorisation for memantine. The manufacturer included data from patients with moderate disease only in these trials using the individual patient data. In addition, the manufacturer included trials of monotherapy and combination therapy in the pooled results presented in this section whereas the Assessment Group analysed each separately. Evidence from prospective longitudinal and observational studies was also presented\n【76】 - One new randomised controlled trial of memantine monotherapy included by the Assessment Group showed a statistically significant benefit in a cognitive measure using SIB with memantine compared with placebo. When data from this trial were added to those of NICE technology appraisal guidance 111, a statistically significant benefit was reported at 12 weeks, but this was not maintained at 24–48 weeks (mean changes from baseline versus placebo of 4.147  and 3.254  at 12 and 24–28 weeks using SIB score). Studies included in the manufacturer's meta-analysis for memantine reported a statistically significant benefit in ADAS-cog and SIB compared with placebo at the end of study and at 24 weeks (standardised mean difference = −0.26, p < 0.0001)\n【77】 - The results from the new study included by the Assessment Group showed no significant benefit in functional outcome measured by ADCS-ADL for memantine monotherapy compared with placebo at 12 weeks or when measured with the Functional Assessment Staging (FAST) instrument. The data were synthesised with the existing evidence in random-effects meta-analysis. Two studies provided data for functional effect as measured by ADCS-ADL19 version. The results were not statistically significant at 12 weeks and were only just significant at 24–28 weeks (mean changes from baseline versus placebo of 0.877  and 1.408  at 12 and 24­28 weeks respectively using ADCS-ADL score and −0.341  at 24–28 weeks respectively using FAST score). The manufacturer's meta-analysis for memantine in moderate to severe disease showed a statistically significant difference compared with placebo on the ADCS-ADL19 and ADCS-ADL23 (standardised mean difference = −0.18, p < 0.0007)\n【78】 - The study for memantine monotherapy that was published after 2004 and included by the Assessment Group measured behavioural outcomes using NPI and the Behavioural Rating Scale for Geriatric Patients (BGP). Neither measure showed a statistically significant benefit of memantine. The data were pooled with the existing data at 24–28 weeks, which did not show a statistically significant gain from memantine compared with placebo (a mean change from baseline versus placebo of −1.608 (p = 0.314) at 24–28 weeks using NPI score). The results of the meta-analysis by the manufacturer of memantine in moderate to severe disease showed a statistically significant (p = 0.03) benefit in terms of NPI and NPI-Nursing Home version (standardised mean difference = −0.12, p = 0.03)\n【79】 - According to the Assessment Group, one new study for memantine monotherapy measured global outcomes with the CIBIC-plus but the differences found were not statistically significant. When new data were pooled with the existing studies, the overall pooled estimate showed a statistically significant beneficial effect from memantine compared with placebo (a mean change from baseline versus placebo of −0.300  at 24–28 weeks using CIBIC-plus score). Studies included by the manufacturer in the meta-analysis for memantine used CIBIC-plus or the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study – Clinical Global Impression of Change (ADCS-CGIC). The standardised mean difference in the manufacturer's meta-analysis for memantine in moderate to severe disease for global outcomes (CIBIC-plus) compared with placebo was statistically significant (standardised mean difference = −0.22, p < 0.0001)\n【80】 - The Assessment Group noted that none of the new randomised studies included in the assessment report provided any additional data on quality of life, time to institutionalisation or mortality with memantine\n【81】 - The manufacturer of memantine included an analysis of a subgroup of patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease with agitation, aggression and/or psychotic symptoms to show that memantine offers enhanced benefits in this subgroup in terms of cognition and function. The manufacturer also included an indirect comparison with risperidone, which was not a comparator in the scope and therefore outside the scope of this review. This analysis was not included by the Assessment Group because no subgroup analyses or individual patient data had been published. The MAG-D study was ongoing at the time of writing the assessment report, so was not included by the Assessment Group. In addition, the manufacturer of memantine submitted data from prospective longitudinal and observational studies to support the view that cognitive and functional benefits of memantine are maintained over years, that memantine delays time to institutionalisation, reduces the need for antipsychotic use and that discontinuation of memantine is associated with an increased use of antipsychotics compared with continuous memantine treatment\n【82】 - According to the Assessment Group, the proportion of any adverse events for memantine in the new study was similar in treatment and control groups (treatment = 74%, control = 73%). The main adverse events in the memantine group were agitation and hypertension, and agitation and falls in the control group. This did not change assumptions about the safety of memantine from technology appraisal guidance 111. The manufacturer highlighted a published meta-analysis of safety data from clinical trials which also showed the most common adverse events with memantine to be agitation and falls. However, it noted that both have a numerically lower incidence than placebo\n【83】 - The Assessment Group found one new study of memantine in combination with any of the AChE inhibitors. It assessed the clinical effectiveness of memantine combination therapy separately from monotherapy. This was different from the approach taken in NICE technology appraisal guidance 111 and by the manufacturer of memantine. The Assessment Group found one new trial that compared memantine plus a sdose AChE inhibitor with an AChE inhibitor plus placebo. This trial did not show any benefit from combining memantine with an AChE inhibitor on cognitive, functional, behavioural or global outcomes. A trial that compared memantine plus donepezil with donepezil plus placebo was included in NICE technology appraisal guidance 111. Pooling the new trial with the previous trial of memantine in combination with an AChE inhibitor did not show any additional benefit from combination therapy. The manufacturer of memantine commented that its submitted meta-analysis of six trials showed memantine to be significantly superior to placebo on most outcomes, as adjunct and monotherapy. It also stated that interaction between treatment effect and presence of background treatment was found not to be significant\n【84】 - The manufacturer of memantine referred to safety reports since 2002, two safety reviews and a meta-analysis. It concluded that memantine was well tolerated when used as monotherapy or as combination therapy\n【85】 ## Summary\n【86】 - The Assessment Group identified 17 new randomised controlled trials and four systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials. According to the Assessment Group, there was an increase in the amount and precision of available evidence for the clinical effectiveness of the AChE inhibitors and memantine. For the AChE inhibitors, the new studies supported and strengthened the previous evidence of benefit in terms of cognitive outcomes, but results for other outcomes were mixed. For memantine monotherapy, the new evidence did not support evidence of statistically significant benefit compared with placebo for any outcome, but the pooled evidence with previous evidence from before 2004 showed improvement in cognition at 12 weeks and in function at 24–28 weeks\n【87】 - The Assessment Group concluded that the evidence for monotherapy in the three manufacturer's submissions was broadly consistent with its own, but highlighted that there were differences between the studies included by the manufacturers and its own review. In addition, the Assessment Group analysed monotherapy and combination therapy separately, whereas the manufacturer of memantine combined the two in its submitted meta-analysis\n【88】 - The Assessment Group considered the quality of the new placebo-controlled studies published since 2004 to be 'disappointing'. Issues included the inappropriate use of last observation carried forward and observed cases analysis instead of intention-to-treat analysis, inadequate reporting of randomisation and allocation, and the small size of studies for donepezil in particular. According to the Assessment Group, the robustness of the new evidence provided by the head-to-head studies was limited by the poor quality of all but one of the studies. Important gaps in the evidence remain\n【89】 # Cost effectiveness\n【90】 - The Assessment Group conducted a systematic review of published economic evaluations since 2004. The Assessment Group, the manufacturer of donepezil (Eisai/Pfizer) and the manufacturer of memantine (Lundbeck) submitted new economic models. The Assessment Group's model included all technologies. Because of differences in the marketing authorisations, the base-case cost effectiveness of the AChE inhibitors and memantine were modelled separately in mild to moderate and moderate to severe disease respectively. No new economic models were submitted by the manufacturers of galantamine and rivastigmine. The manufacturer of galantamine highlighted issues with the previous model from NICE technology appraisal guidance 111\n【91】 ## Mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease\n【92】 - The Assessment Group conducted a systematic review of published economic evaluations since 2004. It identified eight studies of cost effectiveness specifically for donepezil and one that reported on the cost effectiveness of both donepezil and rivastigmine. According to the Assessment Group, these publications generally supported the cost effectiveness of donepezil in the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease\n【93】 - Manufacturer's model for donepezil\n【94】 - The manufacturer of donepezil submitted an economic model that compared the cost effectiveness of donepezil with best supportive care in people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease using a discrete event simulation approach over a lifetime. The baseline characteristics of the model population (including age, sex, race, measures of cognition , function , behaviour  and concomitant treatments) were based on 221 people with mild disease and 605 people with moderate disease from a pool of three randomised controlled trials. The model used a weighted sampling approach to sample 1000 individuals from the pooled trial populations, and these individuals were then replicated in the model and allocated to donepezil or no AChE inhibitor treatment. Disease progression and treatment effect were measured using cognition (MMSE), activities of daily living (ADL and IADL) and behaviour (NPI). Regression equations were formulated based on data from a US registry (the CERAD study) and seven donepezil clinical trials spanning mild to severe Alzheimer's disease and including data from two open-label extensions of the studies. The updated MMSE score was then used to predict the change in ADL, IADL and NPI. The proportion of people institutionalised depended on severity of Alzheimer's disease\n【95】 - The manufacturer's base-case results estimated that donepezil dominated best supportive care because it was less costly and more effective in people with mild, moderate and mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. The manufacturer reported per patient QALY gains of 0.133 and 0.098 and estimated total per patient cost saving of £3379 and £1889 for groups with mild and moderate disease respectively. When the overall mild to moderate disease population was considered, total cost savings amounted to £2354 and people gained an average of 0.109 QALYs including patient utility alone, and 0.121 including patient and carer utilities. The manufacturer of donepezil estimated a delay to institutionalisation of 2 months\n【96】 - All but one of the one-way sensitivity analyses conducted by the manufacturer of donepezil in the mild and moderate disease populations (including varying the time horizon, discount rate, MMSE progression, treatment effect, discontinuation, treatment duration, costs of care, costs of nursing home care, patient and carer QALY effect, costs of physician visits, and the 30–50% reduced price of donepezil after loss of patent protection in 2012) resulted in donepezil being dominant. The exception was when nursing home costs were reduced by 50%, which changed the incremental difference in costs from a cost saving of £3379 in the base case to an increased cost of £275, which gave an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £1866 per QALY gained for mild Alzheimer's disease. When nursing costs were reduced in the moderate disease population, the costs were increased from a cost saving of £1889 in the base case to a cost of £1370, giving an ICER of £7093 per QALY gained. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis reported a 74% and 70% probability of donepezil being cost effective at a threshold of £20,000 per QALY gained in the mild and moderate disease populations respectively (and a 78% and 74% probability respectively at a threshold of £30,000 per QALY)\n【97】 - Issues raised by the Assessment Group included:\n【98】 - the generalisability of the CERAD (US-based) study\n【99】 - potential double counting of improvement in MMSE score in the regression equations for NPI, ADL and IADL\n【100】 - the data for the probability of needing institutionalised care being based on a nursing home population\n【101】 - uncertainty about the quality of inputs, including the link that was made between MMSE and institutionalisation and overestimation of treatment effect\n【102】 - excluding a possible increase in carer utility after institutionalisation\n【103】 - including non-NHS/personal social services costs\n【104】 - including cost and utility inputs based on a cohort approach\n【105】 - uncertainties about the probabilistic sensitivity analysis\n【106】 - The Assessment Group made several changes to the manufacturer's model, which included corrected MMSE scaling, hazard calculations and life expectancy. These amendments had little impact on the manufacturer's deterministic and probabilistic ICERs, which continued to show that donepezil dominated best supportive care in mild and moderate Alzheimer's disease. The Assessment Group also ran its own assumptions through the model and this also did not change the outcome of dominance\n【107】 - In response to comments in the assessment report, the representative of the manufacturer of donepezil stated that the improvement in MMSE score had not been double counted in its model. The manufacturer also clarified that a survival effect had not been included\n【108】 - The Assessment Group conducted a systematic review of published economic evaluations since 2004. It identified one study of cost effectiveness specifically for rivastigmine, two for galantamine, and one that reported on the cost effectiveness of both donepezil and rivastigmine. According to the Assessment Group, these publications generally supported the cost effectiveness of the AChE inhibitors in mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. Most of the publications applied the existing model of Alzheimer's disease (from NICE technology appraisal guidance 111) to new settings\n【109】 - The manufacturers of galantamine and rivastigmine did not submit new economic models. The manufacturer of galantamine highlighted issues with the previous model from NICE technology appraisal guidance 111 including:\n【110】 - the need to include long-term efficacy data\n【111】 - recognition of the full impact of decline in untreated patients with mild disease\n【112】 - verestimation of mortality\n【113】 - the need for current cost data\n【114】 - recognition of 'no change' on global efficacy after 6 months or longer\n【115】 - consideration of costs to the individual, carer time and costs\n【116】 - exploration of responder analyses\n【117】 - The Assessment Group modelled the cost effectiveness of the AChE inhibitors and memantine separately because of the differences in the marketing authorisations. The base-case model for the AChE inhibitors followed a cohort of 1000 individuals with mild to moderate (MMSE 26–10) Alzheimer's disease for which the comparators were donepezil, rivastigmine (patch and capsule), galantamine and best supportive care. The Assessment Group used a prevalent cohort approach. Differentiation of treatment effect according to severity of disease (that is, mild or moderate) was not included in the base-case model. Populations with mild and moderate disease were assessed individually in the sensitivity analyses\n【118】 - The Assessment Group's base case for mild to moderate disease evaluated the cost effectiveness of the AChE inhibitors over a lifetime (20-year) time horizon. Memantine was not included in the base case for mild to moderate disease. The Assessment Group constructed a Markov model that estimated the time to institutionalisation, which was defined as 'living in a residential home or a nursing home (not short respite care) or in a hospital on a long-term or permanent basis'. The model included three health states: pre-institutionalisation, institutionalisation and death. Depending on the severity of Alzheimer's disease at the beginning of the model, people could enter the model in the pre-institutionalised or institutionalised health state. Institutionalisation was equivalent to severe Alzheimer's disease (MMSE < 10) at which point treatment with an AChE inhibitor stopped in line with the marketing authorisations. Individual patients' data were used to estimate the proportion of the total cohort in each state at the end of each monthly cycle. An exponential survival regression model was fitted with time to end of pre-institutionalisation (including early death) as the response variable and MMSE, Barthel-ADL and age at start of study as covariates. The model incorporated a gradual increase in costs and gradual reduction in health-related quality of life with time. Cost and benefits were discounted at a rate of 3.5%. A constant rate of 4% discontinuation per monthly cycle for all drugs at all doses was assumed following a review of the included clinical trial evidence. Therefore within 25 months all patients were assumed to have stopped treatment\n【119】 - Patient characteristics (cognition  and function  with three subgroups defined by age) were based mainly on individual patients' data from a community-based cohort study of people with untreated Alzheimer's disease by Wolstenholme and colleagues in Oxfordshire (n = 92). People starting in the model had already been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease for a median of 4.0 years and a mean of 4.9 years. Data from the London and South-East Region Alzheimer's Disease (LASER-AD) study were used to predict the proportion of patients who, at the start of the decision model, were in the institutionalised state (10% for the mild to moderate cohort and 40% for the moderate to severe cohort, based on 5.6% of people with MMSE ≥ 19, 27.1% of people with MMSE 15­19 and 59% people with MMSE < 19). In the base-case analysis, it was assumed that treatment delayed time to institutionalisation but not to death. Time to death was predicted by age, cognition (MMSE) and function (ADL) using equations from the Wolstenholme cohort data\n【120】 - Estimates of treatment effect in the Assessment Group's model (MMSE and ADCS-ADL, in particular) taken from the placebo-controlled randomised controlled trials identified in the systematic review of clinical effectiveness were applied to baseline estimates of best supportive care for time to institutionalisation and death. Estimates of clinical effectiveness were slightly different to those in the clinical effectiveness section of the assessment report in that only randomised controlled trials of licensed doses were considered. Rivastigmine patches were considered separately to capsules. The assessment report noted literature highlighting that patients self-report much higher utilities than those estimated by carers, particularly in people with severe Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, the base-case model included patient utilities based on carer-proxy utility values. Self-reported patient utilities and carer utilities were included in the sensitivity analysis. Carer utility associated with caring for patients with different CDR severities of Alzheimer's disease was mapped onto the MMSE scale. The utility of caring for someone with mild dementia (MMSE 21–26) was 0.87, which was reduced to 0.86 when caring for someone with severe dementia (MMSE of less than 10). The source publication (Jonsson and colleagues) reported only the mean utility values and not the uncertainty in the utility estimates\n【121】 - The monthly drug costs included in the Assessment Group model, based on the BNF edition 58, were £83 for galantamine, £97 for donepezil, £79 for rivastigmine patches, and £72 for rivastigmine capsules. Additional resource use in the Assessment Group's model was estimated from the Wolstenholme cohort study. The cost of outpatient visits was assumed to be £26 per month and £158 for a 6-monthly assessment. The overall mean monthly cost of institutionalised care was estimated at £2941 (28% of which was assumed to be self-funded) and the cost of pre-institutionalised care depended on the severity of disease and the time to institutionalisation (for example, 1 year before institutionalisation the mean monthly costs for people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease was £1938 per month compared with £2427 per month for people with moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease). No adverse events or carer costs were included in the economic model\n【122】 - After comments from consultees and commentators on the assessment report, the Assessment Group made changes to the modelling of treatment effect based on the equations predicting time to institutionalisation and overall survival using age, cognition and function, and the resulting ICERs quoted in the assessment report. The Committee considered the revised outputs only\n【123】 - The Assessment Group presented the revised deterministic ICERs and one-way sensitivity analysis (which included an analysis of the robustness of the ICERs to different structural assumptions) and the probabilistic ICERs (which represent the combined effect of some of the parameter uncertainties in the model) for each of the technologies. The deterministic model estimated that treatment with an AChE inhibitor delays time to institutional care by between 1.4 and 1.7 months. The deterministic base-case analyses and the probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated that all AChE inhibitors dominated best supportive care. Galantamine was associated with the least costs (£69,592 compared with £70,212 for best supportive care) but donepezil was associated with the greatest QALY gains (1.619 compared with 1.584 with best supportive care). The Assessment Group noted that the differences in the costs and QALYs between the AChE inhibitors were very small (total costs ranged from £69,592 to £69,678 and total QALYs ranged from 1.613 to 1.619). The probabilistic sensitivity analysis results did not indicate a particular AChE inhibitor as having a much greater probability of being cost effective compared with any of the other AChE inhibitors. For example, rivastigmine patches had the highest probability (32%) of being cost effective at thresholds of £20,000 and £30,000 per QALY gained, whereas donepezil had a probability of 27% of being the most cost-effective treatment option at a threshold of £20,000 and of 28% at a threshold of £30,000 per QALY\n【124】 - The Assessment Group conducted one-way sensitivity analyses on the sensitivity of the ICERs to different parameters. The most important parameters were whether a treatment effect on survival was assumed and the rate of discontinuation of drug therapy. Assuming that there was a positive effect of treatment on mortality for all treatments of 1.9 to 2.2 months, it was estimated that treatment with rivastigmine patches provided an additional 0.077 QALYs per patient compared with best supportive care, with additional costs of £2840, leading to an ICER of £37,100 per QALY gained. This was in contrast to rivastigmine patches dominating best supportive care in the base case. In the incremental analysis, when including survival effect as a one-way sensitivity analysis, treatment with galantamine or donepezil provided additional QALYs and additional costs compared with rivastigmine patches. This led to ICERs of £41,800 per QALY gained for galantamine compared with rivastigmine patches, and £51,800 per QALY gained for donepezil compared with galantamine. The Assessment Group explained that this increase in the ICER was expected because when no survival effect was assumed (as per the base case), the delay in time to institutionalisation with treatment resulted in substantial savings in the costs that would have been incurred as a consequence of living in an institution. Assuming that there was also a survival benefit with treatment meant that the costs incurred from living in an institution would be delayed, but not saved. Therefore the incremental difference in costs would be higher and the ICER would increase. Lowering the estimate of the discontinuation rate below 4% resulted in greater treatment and monitoring costs and this led to a negative net benefit for the AChE inhibitors. Higher estimates led to fewer costs and greater net treatment benefit\n【125】 - The manufacturer of donepezil and the Assessment Group both reported that donepezil treatment dominated best supportive care for both the mild and moderate populations. However, the manufacturer reported per patient QALY gains of 0.133 and estimated total per patient cost savings of £3379 for people with mild disease compared with 0.034 QALY gains and a saving of £551 in the Assessment Group's model. The manufacturer reported per patient QALY gains of 0.098 and estimated total per patient cost savings of £1889 for people with moderate disease compared with 0.035 QALY gains and a saving of £621 in the Assessment Group's model\n【126】 - Differences between the results of Assessment Group and manufacturer's models may be accounted for by the following:\n【127】 - differences between the models in terms of estimated overall survival (4.6 undiscounted life years for the moderate cohort for the manufacturer compared with 3.6 years for the Assessment Group)\n【128】 - percent of remaining lifetime spent living in the community (40% in the manufacturer model compared with 67% in the Assessment Group's model for the moderate cohort)\n【129】 - assumptions of treatment effect, calculation of pre-institutionalisation cost (MMSE in the donepezil model compared with time to institutionalisation in the Assessment Group's model)\n【130】 - differences in the cost of institutional care (£2801 per month in the donepezil model compared with £2117 in the Assessment Group's model)\n【131】 - inclusion of carer utility\n【132】 - inclusion of non-NHS/personal social services costs (that is, costs to the individual of institutional care)\n【133】 - The Assessment Group also considered the differences in its model compared with the model from NICE technology appraisal guidance 111 (the SHTAC model). The key differences in the Assessment Group's model were that:\n【134】 - the sources used to model disease progression were different\n【135】 - updated estimates of costs and effectiveness were used\n【136】 - costs and utilities were varied according to time before institutionalisation\n【137】 - discontinuation of treatment was accounted for. The SHTAC model used a risk equation to predict time to needing full-time care. This was based on US data (n = 236), in which a number of different domains (ADAS-cog, psychiatric symptoms, extrapyramidal symptoms, age of onset and duration of illness) affected the time to institutionalisation. The Assessment Group's model, in contrast, was based on UK data (n = 92) and assumed that age and MMSE score predicted institutionalisation. The results of the models differed in the time spent in the institutionalised or full-time care states, which consequently affected costs. A longer estimated survival in the SHTAC model compared with the Assessment Group's model (6.5 compared with 3.8 years) led to higher total costs and total QALYs in the SHTAC model. The Assessment Group assumed less of a treatment effect for an AChE inhibitor, which translated to a slightly shorter delay to full-time care or institutionalisation (approximately 2 months in the SHTAC model compared with 1.4 to 1.7 months in the Assessment Group's model). The costs in the pre-institutional state in the Assessment Group's model were varied according to time, which led to lower average costs in the pre-institutional state in the Assessment Group's model. The difference in incremental costs in the Assessment Group model compared with the SHTAC model was a key factor in the different estimates of costs effectiveness (for example, an ICER of over £30,000 per QALY gained in the SHTAC model for donepezil, compared with donepezil dominating best supportive care in the Assessment Group's model). Including discontinuation of treatment in the Assessment Group's model led to fewer costs and greater net benefit associated with the AChE inhibitors, and so when discontinuation of treatment was included in the SHTAC model, this reduced the estimated ICER\n【138】 - The Assessment Group noted some limitations of its model. These were that:\n【139】 - it assumed a treatment benefit in cognition and function but not in behavioural and psychological symptoms\n【140】 - the expression of treatment effectiveness was mainly based on delay in time to institutionalisation\n【141】 - changes in cost and utility before institutionalisation were assumed to be delayed by the same amount of time as institutionalisation\n【142】 - the generalisability of the Wolstenholme cohort to the UK population was uncertain\n【143】 - full treatment effect at 6 months was assumed. The Assessment Group presented the deterministic ICER for each treatment to provide a comparison with best supportive care so that the data were comparable with those presented in NICE technology appraisal guidance 111\n【144】 ## Moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease\n【145】 - The Assessment Group's systematic review of literature published since 2004 identified six new cost-effectiveness studies for memantine. According to the Assessment Group, these publications generally supported the cost effectiveness of memantine for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease\n【146】 - Manufacturer's model for memantine\n【147】 - The manufacturer submitted a Markov cohort model of the cost effectiveness of memantine compared with best supportive care over a 5-year time horizon in people with moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease and a subgroup of people with aggression, agitation and/or psychotic symptoms at baseline based on the NPI scale (at least one domain among agitation/aggression, delusion and hallucination with a score ≥ 3). The model included three states: pre-full-time care; full-time care; and death. Full-time care was defined as either dependent or institutionalised. Transition probabilities, including the baseline probability (on no treatment) of moving from pre-full-time care to full-time care and the probability of death were estimated using data from the LASER-AD UK epidemiological study. Predictors of the length of time to patients entering full-time care included measures of cognition (ADAS-Cog), function (ADCS-ADL), behaviour (NPI) and time in months. The clinical effectiveness of memantine, for which no additional benefit was assumed beyond 6 months, was based on a meta-analysis of six clinical trials of patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease receiving memantine monotherapy or memantine adjunct treatment while on a sdose of AChE inhibitors. Weighted mean differences were used as predictors in the risk equation estimating monthly probability of entering full-time care to incorporate treatment effect. NHS and personal social services costs were included. Resource use data were taken from the LASER-AD study and the Personal Social Services Research Unit (PSSRU). MIMS March 2010 was used for costs, which were discounted at 3.5%. Indirect costs and quality-of-life effects on relatives and carers were not included. Utility estimates were derived from the LASER-AD study, which involved mapping of three instruments (HSQ-12, Ferm's D test and QoL-AD) onto the EQ-5D. The manufacturer ran the model probabilistically\n【148】 - The manufacturer found that memantine dominated best supportive care (that is, no pharmacological treatment) because additional QALYs were gained (0.031) at a cost saving of £1711. Memantine treatment was associated with a delay to full-time care of 6 weeks. Additional treatment benefits were reported in the subgroup of patients with aggression, agitation and/or psychotic symptoms in whom the delay to full-time care was prolonged by up to 11 weeks with incremental QALY gains of 0.069 and a cost saving of £4971\n【149】 - The manufacturer conducted sensitivity analyses. These explored the effect of different treatment effects, discount rates, costs of pre-full-time care, costs of full-time care and alternative sets of utilities on the cost-effectiveness estimates. The results all continued to show that memantine dominated best supportive care for the overall population and subgroups\n【150】 - The Assessment Group highlighted several issues with the manufacturer of memantine's model. Although the new subgroup was defined differently and based on clinical expertise, the Assessment Group noted that a behavioural subgroup had not previously been accepted by the Appraisal Committee for NICE technology appraisal guidance 111. The manufacturer did not include an AChE inhibitor as a comparator for the population with moderate disease as specified in the scope. There was uncertainty about the risk equation because of lack of clarity over generalisability of the LASER-AD study (many participants in this study had been or were still receiving treatment with AChE inhibitors). The Assessment Group also noted a lack of clarity about the categorisation of 'dependence', inclusion of data from patients with mild disease, poor reporting of statistical analyses and lack of validation from an external source. The manufacturer responded to these criticisms, providing supplementary information in its comments on the assessment report. In addition, because the trials used observed cases with last observation carried forward in the analysis instead of an intention-to-treat analysis, the Assessment Group was concerned that the clinical-effectiveness estimates may have been biased. The manufacturer responded to these comments to confirm that all analyses were performed with an intention-to-treat population using the observed cases approach, with a 'last observation carried forward' analysis to confirm results. There was also uncertainty about the methods used to map one outcome measure to another (mapping one health-related quality-of-life measure onto another, mapping SIB onto the ADAS-cog and rescaling one version of ADCS-ADL to another), pooling data for combination therapy and monotherapy, and using NPI rather than NPI hallucinations as a predictor of time to full-time care. There was also a lack of clarity over the sources of data, inclusion of costs to individuals and retrospective collection of resource data in the LASER-AD study. Benefits to carers were not included in the model, and mapping of health-related quality-of-life data to EQ-5D was poorly described. The Assessment Group queried whether the manufacturer's estimates of at least 90% for the probability of memantine being cost effective at £20,000 and £30,000 thresholds were plausible given the uncertainties about the clinical benefit of memantine\n【151】 - The cost effectiveness of the AChE inhibitors and memantine were modelled separately by the Assessment Group because of the differences in the marketing authorisations. Memantine was not included in the SHTAC model in NICE technology appraisal guidance 111. The base-case model for memantine followed a cohort of 1000 individuals with moderate to severe (MMSE 20­0) Alzheimer's disease, for which the comparator was best supportive care. Populations with moderate and severe disease were assessed individually in the sensitivity analyses. The Assessment Group's model is described in sections 4.2.12 to 4.2.16. Different assumptions used in the moderate to severe model were that a higher proportion of people started in institutional care (40% compared with 10% in the mild to moderate model) and treatment with memantine was continued after people entered institutional care (whereas treatment with AChE inhibitors was discontinued when people entered institutional care in the mild to moderate model). The cost of monthly memantine was £71\n【152】 - The deterministic Assessment Group's model showed that treatment with memantine delayed time to institutional care by about 0.8 months compared with best supportive care. The ICERs were £32,100 per QALY gained (a gain of 0.013 QALYs over a patient's lifetime when treated with memantine compared with best supportive care and the extra cost was £405)\n【153】 - The Assessment Group's probabilistic sensitivity analysis of the cost effectiveness of memantine in the population with moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease estimated a probability of memantine being more cost effective than best supportive care of less than 38% at a threshold of £30,000 per QALY gained and 28% at £20,000 per QALY gained. The mean ICER from the probabilistic sensitivity analysis for memantine compared with best supportive care was £36,900 per QALY gained\n【154】 - The Assessment Group conducted one-way sensitivity analyses to assess the sensitivity of the ICER to different parameters. When a positive treatment effect on survival was assumed, the ICER of memantine compared with best supportive care increased to £65,619 per QALY gained\n【155】 - The cost-effectiveness model submitted by the manufacturer of memantine reported that treatment with memantine dominated best supportive care. The Assessment Group's model, however, estimated an ICER of £32,100 per QALY gained. One of the main differences between the manufacturer's model and the Assessment Group's model was that treatment was assumed to continue in institutionalisation by the Assessment Group but not the manufacturer. The estimated overall survival was similar in the two models (3.7 years in the manufacturer's model and 3.5 years in the Assessment Group's model). Another key difference between the models was that the manufacturer's model assumed a greater treatment effect with memantine, which translated to a delay to entering full-time care of 1 month compared with a delay of 0.8 months estimated by the Assessment Group's model. Higher costs were attributed to the full-time care state in the manufacturer's model (£3267 compared with £2117 in the Assessment Group's model). The manufacturer's model also assumed a higher cost of, and a longer time in, pre-institutional care with treatment (1.73 years in the manufacturer's model compared with 1.5 years in the Assessment Group's model)\n【156】 - The Assessment Group ran the manufacturer of memantine's model using its own assumptions. This had a negligible impact on the outputs\n【157】 - The Assessment Group conducted analyses of the individual mild, moderate and severe populations for the AChE inhibitors, AChE inhibitors and memantine, and memantine respectively (all including best supportive care). Each technology was compared with the next cheapest, non-dominated technology and the ICERs were rounded to the nearest £100. The Assessment Group highlighted that caution should be taken when assessing these results because effectiveness estimates were derived from trials that included populations with varying disease severity. In the subgroup analyses for mild or moderate Alzheimer's disease, all treatments still dominated best supportive care. Memantine had an ICER of £26,500 per QALY gained in severe disease\n【158】 ## Other key issues\n【159】 - NICE technology appraisal guidance 111 acknowledged the issues in using the MMSE instrument alone as a measure of severity in particular groups. This included people with learning or other disabilities, linguistic or other communication difficulties, or if it is not possible to use the MMSE in a language in which the patient is sufficiently fluent\n【160】 - Clinical specialists, patient experts and primary care trust commissioners highlighted the need for a wide range of services for people with Alzheimer's disease, and the fact that drugs are just one aspect of this range of care\n【161】 # Consideration of the evidence\n【162】 - The Appraisal Committee reviewed the data available on the clinical and cost effectiveness of donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine and memantine having considered evidence on the nature of Alzheimer's disease and the value placed on the benefits of donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine and memantine by people with the condition, those who represent them, and clinical specialists. It also took into account the effective use of NHS resources\n【163】 - The Committee was aware that there is currently no cure for Alzheimer's disease and that the AChE inhibitors and memantine treat the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease but do not slow the progression of the disease. The Committee was also aware that access to general support services and care for people with Alzheimer's disease is variable and that the availability of pharmacological treatment was relevant to appropriate wider management and support. The Committee considered the current management of Alzheimer's disease under the recommendations of NICE technology appraisal guidance 111, which recommends AChE inhibitors for the treatment of moderate Alzheimer's disease. The Committee was aware of both the importance of early diagnosis and of carers' and clinical views of the advantages of early use of AChE inhibitors in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. The Committee heard from clinical specialists that there is variation in clinical practice and that AChE inhibitors are also used to treat some patients with an MMSE score of above 20. The clinical specialists also noted that memantine is used in clinical practice. The Committee heard from clinical specialists that antipsychotics are used in clinical practice for people with Alzheimer's disease who have severe behavioural symptoms, but that their use was generally discouraged in people with milder symptoms because of the emerging evidence on increased risk of serious adverse events when used in older people\n【164】 - The Committee heard from clinical specialists that the MMSE scale was originally developed as a screening tool to aid the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. It also heard that NICE technology appraisal guidance 111 had defined the eligibility of people for treatment with AChE inhibitors and when these drugs should be stopped according to MMSE scores (that is, the degree of loss in patient cognition), among other criteria. The Committee noted, as did the Appraisal Committee for NICE technology appraisal guidance 111, that because the MMSE scale is less sensitive to changes in cognition for people at the extreme ends of the scale, clinical judgement is necessary (rather than a rigid adherence to the MMSE alone) to assess the severity of Alzheimer's disease and the suitability of AChE inhibitors on an individual patient basis. In addition, the clinical specialists indicated that a global assessment of the effects of Alzheimer's disease was also important. The Committee was aware of the difficulties of using the MMSE when assessing people with learning difficulties or communication difficulties, or if the person is not fluent in the language of the measurement tool. The Committee also heard from clinical specialists that the use of the MMSE scale alone may not be sensitive enough to assess the severity of Alzheimer's disease in people with a high level of education. The Committee thus recognised the difficulties of using MMSE score alone to assess the severity of Alzheimer's disease and the response to AChE inhibitors. The Committee agreed that cognitive scales alone such as the MMSE are not always appropriate for assessing the severity of dementia. The Committee concluded that if cognitive scales are not appropriate for assessing the need for treatment, or whether to continue treatment, then clinicians should use another appropriate method of assessment\n【165】 ## Clinical effectiveness\n【166】 - The Committee considered the available evidence on the clinical effectiveness of the AChE inhibitors submitted by the Assessment Group, consultees and commentators. It considered the new evidence available since NICE technology appraisal guidance 111 was published and the impact of the new evidence when combined with the data from NICE technology appraisal guidance 111. The Committee stated that a small amount of new evidence about the clinical effectiveness of the AChE inhibitors from randomised controlled trials had been published since 2004. The Committee recognised the heterogeneity of outcome measures in trials and was aware of the limitations of some of the instruments used in the clinical trials, including cognitive and behavioural scales\n【167】 - The Committee considered the results from the new placebo-controlled randomised clinical trials, which continued to show the small but definite clinical benefit of the AChE inhibitors in mild and moderate Alzheimer's disease compared with best supportive care. The Committee noted that the evidence was almost exclusively based on 6-month long randomised controlled trials because few of these trials had follow-up of over 6 months. The Committee heard from clinical specialists and patient experts that benefits of treatment appeared to last for 2 to 3 years in some patients in open-label studies. The Committee concluded that the new evidence provided additional support to the conclusions from 2004 that each of the AChE inhibitors offers benefits over best supportive care for cognitive, functional and global outcomes, and may offer some benefit in behavioural outcomes, although the nature and extent of behavioural benefits are uncertain owing to mixed results from the available evidence\n【168】 - The Committee considered whether there was evidence that one of the AChE inhibitors was more clinically effective than any other. The Committee noted that only one good-quality head-to-head randomised controlled trial comparing donepezil and rivastigmine had been published since 2004 and that this did not change the conclusions made in NICE technology appraisal guidance 111. The Committee concluded that there was insufficient evidence to differentiate between the AChE inhibitors in terms of clinical effectiveness\n【169】 - The Committee considered whether there was evidence that AChE inhibitors demonstrated benefits in terms of patient and carer health-related quality of life. The Committee noted that quality of life was not assessed in the majority of randomised controlled trials and that there was no evidence from randomised controlled trials that demonstrated any impact. The Committee considered evidence from patient experts that benefits to people with Alzheimer's disease and their carers were not necessarily those picked up by instruments measuring cognition, function, behaviour or global outcomes. In their experience, relevant benefits included maintaining mood, being able to cope and interact with others, and functional activities that might not be scored on currently used scales, such as being able to pick up the phone or switch on the television. In particular, maintaining aspects of personal identity, such as a naturally methodical person being able to put things in order, was considered important. The Committee concluded that although there was no evidence available on health-related quality of life from a systematic review of randomised controlled clinical trials, there was some anecdotal evidence from clinical practice of benefits to patients and carers from using AChE inhibitors\n【170】 - The Committee discussed whether there was evidence of a survival benefit associated with the AChE inhibitors. The Committee was aware that these are symptom-treating rather than disease-modifying treatments. In the absence of evidence from randomised controlled trials, the Committee considered the opinion of clinical specialists, who were not aware of a survival effect associated with the AChE inhibitors. The Committee acknowledged that few deaths occurred during randomised controlled trials, which have generally been short with limited follow-up, and that subsequently mortality data were difficult to obtain. The Committee considered the view of clinical specialists who informed the Committee that death was caused by factors such as age, acute infections, comorbidities and complications of Alzheimer's disease rather than the disease itself. The Committee noted that Alzheimer's disease affects predominantly, but not exclusively, people over 65 years of age. The Committee concluded that there was no evidence to suggest that the AChE inhibitors affected survival\n【171】 - The Committee deliberated whether there was evidence that the AChE inhibitors lead to a delay in institutionalisation. The Committee acknowledged that time to institutionalisation was not generally included as an endpoint in randomised controlled trials and that published data were therefore limited. For example, the AD2000 study collected data on institutionalisation but limited accrual into the trial led to an underpowered conclusion about this outcome. The Committee considered the experiences of clinical specialists and patient experts, who reported that the following were often important factors in the decision to move into institutionalised care: severe behavioural symptoms and the ability of the person with Alzheimer's disease and their family to cope with these, continence issues, and the availability of community support services. Opinion varied between the experts about the degree of impact of the AChE inhibitors on time to institutionalisation. Although one clinical specialist felt that prescribing these drugs has led to a significant delay in people with Alzheimer's disease entering institutions, others thought that this effect was small and many other factors were in operation (such as funding arrangements for state-funded residential care). The Committee was also aware of the individual variability of disease progression, which would influence at what stage a person with Alzheimer's disease would be admitted to an institution. The Committee concluded that although it was clinically plausible that treatment with an AChE inhibitor may delay time to institutionalisation, limited direct evidence was available to assess the size of this effect\n【172】 - The Committee considered the evidence on adverse effects associated with the AChE inhibitors. The Committee acknowledged the gastrointestinal effects of these technologies. However, it concluded that the adverse effects of these technologies were well documented and that overall evidence since 2004 has not changed the tolerability profile of AChE inhibitors, apart from the fewer side effects noted in patients treated with rivastigmine patches than with oral rivastigmine\n【173】 - The Committee considered the available evidence on the clinical effectiveness of memantine submitted by the Assessment Group, consultees and commentators. The Committee understood that memantine had a different mode of action from the AChE inhibitors and in practice would be used later in the treatment pathway in people with more severe Alzheimer's disease, this also being at a time when a higher proportion of people develop behavioural symptoms. It considered the new evidence available since the publication of NICE technology appraisal guidance 111, and the impact of the new evidence when it was combined with the data from the previous appraisal. The Committee noted that two of the randomised controlled trials included in the manufacturer's submission were excluded from the Assessment Group's systematic review because at least 20% of each of the trial populations were people with mild Alzheimer's disease, which is not included in the current licensed indication of memantine\n【174】 - The Committee considered the results of the new randomised controlled trials for memantine and the pooled results in order to estimate the size of clinical effectiveness for memantine compared with placebo or best supportive care. The Committee was aware of the limitations of the instruments used in the clinical trials including cognitive and behavioural scales. The Committee noted that although the new evidence considered by the Assessment Group did not substantially change the estimate of the clinical effectiveness of memantine compared with the review in 2004, the meta-analysis submitted by the manufacturer (which included individual patient data from trials with mixed populations so that the manufacturer was able to exclude data for patients with mild disease) showed significant benefits in the cognitive, functional, global and behavioural domains. The Committee concluded that memantine offers symptomatic benefit in cognitive, functional, global and behavioural outcomes, although the size of this benefit is uncertain\n【175】 - The Committee considered the evidence in the manufacturer's submission on the clinical effectiveness of memantine in a subgroup of patients with agitation, aggression and/or psychotic symptoms, which are more common in patients with severe Alzheimer's disease. This evidence reported a statistically significant benefit of memantine for cognitive, functional and global outcomes and NPI score on agitation, aggression and/or psychotic symptoms in this subgroup. The Committee concluded, on the basis of the manufacturer's evidence and clinical specialist testimony, that memantine appears to have an effect on these symptoms\n【176】 - The Committee considered the clinical effectiveness of memantine as an adjunct to AChE inhibitor treatment. The Committee noted evidence that showed no statistically significant benefit for combination treatment with memantine and AChE inhibitors for cognitive, functional, behavioural or global outcomes. The Committee was also made aware of ongoing trials for combination therapy including the DOMINO-AD (donepezil and memantine in moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease) study. The Committee concluded that combination treatment with memantine and AChE inhibitors could not be recommended because of lack of evidence of additional clinical efficacy compared with memantine monotherapy\n【177】 - The Committee considered the new evidence since 2004 of adverse effects associated with memantine and noted that some patients experience agitation that resolves when the drug is stopped, although agitation was also a main adverse event for those taking placebo. The Committee concluded that the adverse effects of memantine were well documented and that evidence since 2004 has not changed the tolerability profile\n【178】 ## Cost effectiveness\n【179】 - The Committee reviewed the two economic models submitted by the manufacturers of donepezil and memantine alongside the Assessment Group's model. The Committee considered that the key differences between the models included the selection of cohort data used to model disease progression, model structure (Markov compared with a discrete event simulation), the extent to which the model included the effectiveness of treatment for cognitive, functional and behavioural outcomes, and the measurement of patient utility based on patient or carer proxy values\n【180】 - The Committee considered the most appropriate cohort data on which to model disease progression. The Committee heard from clinical specialists about the importance of using data from the UK compared with the US because of differences in the healthcare system, and differences in the management of Alzheimer's disease. The Committee also heard from clinical specialists that UK population data such as that found in the Wolstenholme dataset is the best available data on which to model progression of Alzheimer's disease because of the UK location, its long follow-up, the absence of pharmacological treatment for Alzheimer's disease and the availability of individual patient data. The Committee was aware of the limitations of this dataset including the small population, the relatively old data (collected between 1988 and 1999), which might not reflect current rates of and times to institutionalisation, and the fact that the study was based in a semi-rural location. The Committee concluded that although the Wolstenholme dataset that formed the basis of the Assessment Group's model had these limitations it still represented the best available data\n【181】 - The Committee considered the appropriateness of the structure of the Assessment Group's model, which was based on predicting time to institutionalisation. The Committee was aware that the uncertainty about time to institutionalisation was an issue that affected all submitted models. The Committee recognised the lack of institutionalisation data from randomised controlled trials, the limitations of the AD2000 study which collected institutionalisation data but was underpowered to measure this outcome, and the absence of a systematic review of observational studies available in this area. The Committee discussed the various definitions of institutionalisation. The Committee was aware that in clinical practice, the type of institution would have an impact on time to institutionalisation, as would cost and patient characteristics. The Committee was also aware that the Assessment Group had equated institutionalisation to severe disease, therefore assuming that AChE inhibitors would be stopped on entering an institution. However, the Committee acknowledged that in clinical practice, institutionalisation would not be based on disease severity alone. The Assessment Group used the definition of institutionalisation from the Wolstenholme cohort study, on which disease progression in its model was based\n【182】 - The Committee considered that only the Assessment Group addressed the decision problem in the scope because it included all of the AChE inhibitors as comparators for mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease, whereas the manufacturer of donepezil's model compared donepezil with best supportive care only. The Committee concluded that there were limitations in constructing an economic model based on time to institutionalisation but that the Assessment Group's model was based on the best currently available and detailed UK evidence to evaluate the cost effectiveness of donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine\n【183】 - The Committee discussed the assumption in the Assessment Group's model that age, cognition and function were the key predictors of time to institutionalisation. The Committee was aware of the limitations of scales such as the MMSE in evaluating severity of and change in Alzheimer's disease and also as a proxy for the delay in time to institutionalisation. The Committee also understood that the Wolstenholme study had used a scale of function that had been mapped to another index (the Barthel index), which in turn had been mapped by the Assessment Group to a commonly used index of activities of daily living. The Committee was aware of the potential uncertainties caused by these processes. However, considering all these factors in relation to cognitive and functional scales, the Committee considered it appropriate to use age, cognition and function as key predictors of time to institutionalisation. The Committee considered whether behavioural symptoms should also have been included as a predictor of time to institutionalisation in the Assessment Group's model. The Committee was aware that the Assessment Group's model did not incorporate this because of lack of data. The Committee noted that the clinical specialists and patient experts had emphasised behavioural symptoms being a key factor when deciding when to admit a person with Alzheimer's disease to an institution. The Committee noted that when behaviour was removed from the manufacturer of donepezil's model in sensitivity analyses, it did not have a big impact on the incremental cost-effectiveness results. The Committee concluded that although behaviour was a potential predictor of time to institutionalisation in everyday life, its omission from a model already including cognition and function was unlikely to substantially change the outputs of the model in mild and moderate Alzheimer's disease\n【184】 - The Committee considered the importance of the assumption that there was no survival effect of treatment. The Committee considered the sensitivity analyses conducted by the Assessment Group, which had assumed a survival effect of 1.9–2.2 months and subsequently raised the ICERs for the AChE inhibitors to over £30,000 per QALY gained. The Committee understood that this increase in ICERs was expected. This was because when no survival effect was assumed (as per the base case), the delay in time to institutionalisation with treatment resulted in substantial savings in the costs that would have been incurred as a consequence of living in an institution. Assuming that there was also a survival benefit with treatment meant that the costs incurred from living in an institution would be delayed, but not saved because people would live for longer. Therefore the incremental difference in costs was higher and the ICER increased. The Committee noted both the lack of randomised evidence measuring the survival effect of treatment with the AChE inhibitors and clinical opinion that mortality was more likely to be influenced by other factors unrelated to treatment. The Committee concluded that the assumption of no survival effect from treatment with the AChE inhibitors in the base-case model was appropriate in light of the lack of evidence of survival effect from randomised controlled trials\n【185】 - The Committee considered the assumption of a 4% discontinuation rate of treatment in the Assessment Group's model. The Committee was aware that the Assessment Group's model included the ability to allow for discontinuation and this may have been one explanation for the difference in ICERs resulting from this model and the model used in NICE technology appraisal guidance 111 (the SHTAC model). The Committee considered how the Assessment Group had made the assumption of a constant rate of 4% based on the included randomised controlled trial evidence. For all effectiveness estimates it was assumed that an intention-to-treat analysis had been done, so that estimates related to all participants and not only those continuing on treatment. Given that many randomised controlled trials did not report an intention-to-treat analysis, this assumption was likely to over-estimate any treatment effects in the decision model. However, clinical specialists advised that discontinuation in clinical practice is between 2 and 5% per year and considered a 4% discontinuation rate to be appropriate. In addition, the Committee recognised that in sensitivity analyses, variation in the assumed discontinuation rate had the biggest impact on cost-effectiveness estimates. Increasing discontinuation rates led to fewer costs and greater net benefit for the AChE inhibitors and vice versa. The Committee concluded that it was appropriate to include discontinuation rates in the economic model and accepted that the assumption of 4% was plausible\n【186】 - The Committee considered other inputs to the model, such as assumptions about the costs and QALYs generated in the pre-institutional and institutional health states of the Assessment Group's model. The Committee heard from the Assessment Group that the monthly costs of pre-institutional care and institutional care were higher in its model than in the SHTAC model. When the delay in institutionalisation was taken into account (1.4 to 1.7 months in the Assessment Group's model), donepezil treatment (the example selected by the Assessment Group) in the Assessment Group's model was cost saving compared with best supportive care because the additional costs incurred in pre-institutional care (increased drug costs, monitoring costs and care costs) were outweighed by the cost saving associated with people spending less time in institutional care. In the same way, the QALYs gained by delaying the time to institutionalisation outweighed the QALYs lost in the institutional care health state in the Assessment Group's model\n【187】 - The Committee was aware that the cost of institutionalisation varied according to institution type and the level of care needed, the availability of institutional care and support services, and that funding arrangements for residential care can result in significant individual contributions by the patient or family. The Committee considered it accepto use an average cost for institutional care and accepted the fixed cost of institutionalisation used in the Assessment Group's model. Based on information provided by clinical specialists and patient experts, the Committee also accepted the assumptions in the Assessment Group's model about costs of monitoring the patient every 6 months\n【188】 - The Committee considered whether assumptions and inputs about health-related quality of life and utilities included in the Assessment Group's model were reasonable. The Committee heard that utility values for health-related quality of life reported by patients themselves and by carers as proxy responses were both relevant. The Committee heard from clinical specialists that in early stages of the disease it would be appropriate for the patient themselves to report their own outcomes, but in more severe stages of the disease a proxy utility provided by the carer would be appropriate. The Committee acknowledged that there were differences in the responses given by patients and those given by carers but that in sensitivity analyses conducted by the Assessment Group, changes to utility values had a small impact on ICERs. The Committee concluded that the assumptions and inputs about utilities in the Assessment Group's model were appropriate\n【189】 - The Committee also considered the Assessment Group's approach to a variable cost and utility in the pre-institutionalisation health state. The Committee acknowledged that this was a difference between the Assessment Group and SHTAC models, and may have accounted for some of the differences in the ICERs produced by the two models\n【190】 - The Committee considered whether there were differences in cost effectiveness for particular subgroups of people with Alzheimer's disease. The Committee reviewed the subgroup analyses conducted by the Assessment Group in mild and moderate Alzheimer's disease. The Committee noted that these had been provided as an exploratory analysis by the Assessment Group and that the Assessment Group's model assumed the same treatment effect for patients with mild and moderate disease. The Committee was aware that in NICE technology appraisal guidance 111 a difference in treatment effect between mild and moderate populations was assumed, on the basis of analysis by the Medical Research Council Biostatistics Unit. The Committee was also aware that no subgroup analyses had been identified as part of the systematic review of clinical effectiveness analysis. The Committee also noted that in clinical practice, clinicians found it difficult to differentiate between mild and moderate disease when using the MMSE. The Committee was also aware that many AChE inhibitor trials included patients with both mild and moderate disease\n【191】 - The Committee considered the merits of the Assessment Group's model compared with the manufacturer of donepezil's model. The Committee considered that both models captured the costs and benefits of treatment with greater accuracy than the SHTAC model used in the previous appraisal and that the manufacturer's discrete event simulation model offered an intuitive description of the disease. The Committee considered the enhancements in the Assessment Group's model compared with the SHTAC model and noted that the individual patient data on which disease progression in the Assessment Group's model was based, combined with the differential utility and costs accrued in the pre-institutional health state, led to a more accurate representation of the costs and outcomes of treatment. The Committee further noted that the discrete event simulation model provided by the manufacturer of donepezil (based on a US cohort) was unable to adequately compare all available treatment options within a full incremental analysis. Overall, the Committee preferred the Assessment Group's model over the discrete event simulation model because the modelling of disease progression (based on UK data from patients who had not received treatment with AChE inhibitors) was most appropriate for the UK clinical setting and the model enabled all of the treatments to be compared in a full incremental analysis. The Committee noted, however, that the manufacturer's model was useful to enable comparisons for specific parts of the decision problem and to test the inputs, assumptions and face validity of the Assessment Group's model. Both models showed donepezil to be cost saving\n【192】 - The Committee considered the base-case results for the cost effectiveness of the AChE inhibitors compared with best supportive care. The Committee noted that the key driver of cost effectiveness in the Assessment Group's model was treatment leading to delay to institutionalisation. This assumption led to less time spent in institutional care and subsequent savings to the NHS/personal social services. The Committee considered that, with this assumption, the Assessment Group's model demonstrated that each of the AChE inhibitors was cost saving compared with best supportive care\n【193】 - The Committee noted the small difference in absolute costs and benefits between the AChE inhibitors. It also observed that small changes in some of the inputs and assumptions had significant impacts on the incremental estimates of cost effectiveness. The Committee concluded that overall, the AChE inhibitors donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine had small but demonstrable clinical benefits and were cost-effective treatment options. The Committee concluded that there was insufficient evidence to differentiate between the AChE inhibitors in terms of cost effectiveness and that therefore the best use of NHS resources would be the technology with the lowest acquisition cost (taking into account required daily dose and the price per dose once shared care has started). The Committee further accepted that an alternative AChE inhibitor could be prescribed if it is considered appropriate when taking into account adverse event profile, expectations about adherence, medical comorbidity, possibility of drug interactions (details of which can be found in the individual summaries of product characteristics) and dosing profiles\n【194】 - The Committee considered the two models for the cost effectiveness of memantine presented by the manufacturer and the Assessment Group. It noted that although the structures of the models were similar, there were differences in the assumptions underlying the two models. The Committee considered that all the uncertainties about the assumptions and inputs in the Assessment Group's model for the AChE inhibitors also applied to the memantine model. However, the Committee identified additional uncertainties relating to memantine, such as estimates of treatment effect used in the models. The Committee considered the key differences between the Assessment Group's and manufacturer's models to be the selection of cohort data used to model disease progression, assumptions about the proportion of patients who were institutionalised at the start of treatment, the effectiveness estimates used in the model, and whether the model included the effectiveness of treatment on behavioural symptoms\n【195】 - The Committee considered the cohort data on which disease progression in each of the models was based. The Committee was aware that the manufacturer's model used LASER-AD data to model disease progression, which had shorter follow-up compared with the cohort study used by the Assessment Group. It was also aware that many of the participants of the LASER-AD study were on active treatment. The Committee concluded that the Wolstenholme data used in the Assessment Group's model were more suifor assessing disease progression because this study had longer follow-up and the participants were not receiving active therapies\n【196】 - The Committee considered the assumptions included in the Assessment Group's model. The Committee acknowledged that some of the assumptions may have led to underestimates of the benefits of memantine compared with best supportive care. In the Assessment Group's model, for the 40% of patients with severe Alzheimer's disease who started in institutions or started with a low utility, there was limited opportunity to benefit from treatment, but they nevertheless accrue costs. The Committee therefore concluded that the cost effectiveness of memantine may have been underestimated in the Assessment Group's model for patients with severe Alzheimer's disease, although by how much is uncertain\n【197】 - The Committee considered the appropriateness of including the impact of memantine on behavioural outcomes. The Committee was aware that the Assessment Group had not included behavioural outcomes as a predictor of time to institutionalisation in its model but the model submitted by the manufacturer of memantine had included behaviour as a predictor of time to full-time care. The Committee noted that the manufacturer's model used LASER-AD data to model disease progression, which included the effectiveness of treatment on behavioural symptoms. The Committee heard from the Assessment Group that when the impact of memantine on behavioural symptoms was removed from the manufacturer's model it had little impact on the cost effectiveness of memantine compared with best supportive care. The Committee was also aware, based on the evidence from the patient experts and clinical specialists, that behavioural outcomes were not well captured by the instruments used in clinical trials. The Committee concluded that although behaviour is a potential predictor of time to institutionalisation, not including it in the Assessment Group's model was unlikely to substantially change its outputs for people with moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease\n【198】 - The Committee also noted that the manufacturer's submission included a subgroup analysis of the cost effectiveness of memantine in a subgroup of patients with aggression, agitation and/or psychotic symptoms. The Committee heard from clinical specialists and the manufacturer that memantine appears to have cognitive, functional, global and behavioural effects, particularly in people with aggression, agitation and/or psychotic symptoms, which are more common in people with severe Alzheimer's disease. The Committee accepted that memantine may therefore have the potential to reduce the need for antipsychotics but noted that there was no randomised controlled trial evidence supporting this assumption. The Committee accepted on the basis of the evidence in the manufacturer's submission and expert testimony that memantine may offer benefit to people with severe Alzheimer's disease\n【199】 - The Committee considered the estimates of treatment effect for memantine in the manufacturer's and Assessment Group's models. The Committee noted that estimates of treatment effect were different between the models. The Committee understood that the effectiveness data in the manufacturer's submission were based on a pooled estimate of memantine monotherapy and combination therapy with AChE inhibitors, whereas the Assessment Group's model included effectiveness estimates only for memantine monotherapy. The Committee also noted that the manufacturer's submission was based on analysis of individual patient data of people with moderate Alzheimer's disease taken from two randomised controlled trials that had been submitted to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in order to gain the license extension for memantine in moderate disease. These data had not been included in the Assessment Group's report because more than 20% of the study population in the trials had mild Alzheimer's disease, and so did not fit with the inclusion criteria of the systematic review based on the licensed indications in the decision problem. As a consequence, the Committee found it difficult to reconcile the lack of statistically significant benefit seen in the meta-analysis from the Assessment Group for cognitive, functional and behavioural outcomes with the significant improvements (particularly for behaviour) in the manufacturer's individual patient data analyses. The Committee was uncertain about how much the difference in clinical effectiveness influenced the differences in cost-effectiveness results between the two models. It was also aware, based on the evidence provided by patient experts and clinical specialists, that behaviour was an important factor when considering institutionalisation. However, published evidence was limited because in trials, institutionalisation was not an outcome measure and instruments had limited capacity to capture behavioural changes. The Committee concluded that because the Assessment Group's model did not include results from some trials in the estimate of treatment effect for which access to individual patient data was needed, it may have underestimated the cost effectiveness of memantine, although by how much is uncertain\n【200】 - Taking the above factors into account, the Committee considered that, on balance, the Assessment Group's model provided a suibasis for decision making. This was because the cohort data used to model disease progression were generalisable to the UK, the effectiveness data for memantine monotherapy and combination therapy with AChE inhibitors were not combined, and the cost effectiveness of memantine could be compared with that of the AChE inhibitors in moderate Alzheimer's disease\n【201】 - The Committee considered that the base-case ICER for memantine of £32,100 per QALY gained compared with best supportive care in moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease was likely to be an overestimate of the true cost per QALY gained, although the size of this overestimation was uncertain. The Committee noted that in moderate disease there were active comparators, whereas only memantine has a marketing authorisation for severe disease\n【202】 - The Committee considered the subgroups of people with moderate Alzheimer's disease only and severe Alzheimer's disease only. The Committee noted that in the Assessment Group's exploratory analysis, memantine dominated best supportive care for the moderate group, and for the severe group the ICER for memantine compared with best supportive care was £26,500 per QALY gained. The Committee also noted that both subgroup ICERs were lower than the combined base-case ICER of £32,100 per QALY. The Committee heard from the Assessment Group that this may be because of the different assumptions in the subgroup analysis compared with the base case\n【203】 - The Committee concluded that memantine would not be cost effective compared with the AChE inhibitors in people with moderate disease because it generated fewer QALYs at a higher cost. The Committee noted that the use of memantine in the subgroup with moderate disease would represent a cost-effective use of NHS resources only if best supportive care was the comparator. It concluded that in people with moderate Alzheimer's disease memantine should be recommended for people who are intolerant of or have contraindications to AChE inhibitors\n【204】 - The Committee thought that memantine was likely to have a positive effect on the quality of life of people with severe disease, because they are more likely to experience behavioural symptoms. This was not captured in the Assessment Group's model. Also, even though behavioural benefit did not appear to have a great impact on the results of the manufacturer's model, the Committee had heard from clinical specialists that behavioural effect may not be well captured in the available evidence. The Committee considered that, had it been possible to include the behavioural benefit of memantine in the Assessment Group's model, the ICER would be less than £26,500 per QALY gained. It therefore concluded that treatment with memantine represented a cost-effective use of NHS resources for people with severe Alzheimer's disease\n【205】 ## Other issues\n【206】 - The Committee considered the criteria for recommending the AChE inhibitors in NICE technology appraisal guidance 111.The Committee acknowledged the importance of people with Alzheimer's disease being assessed by a specialist clinician and heard from clinical specialists that treatment with AChE inhibitors and memantine should always be initiated by a clinical specialist in accordance with the recommendations of NICE technology appraisal guidance 111. However, the Committee acknowledged that for assessing whether treatment should be continued, review by a specialist may be substituted by a shared care arrangement because this may put less pressure on local resources while still ensuring optimal treatment for patients\n【207】 - The Committee also considered the recommendations of NICE technology appraisal guidance 111 for specific groups of people with Alzheimer's disease, such as those with disabilities (for example, sensory impairments) or linguistic or other communication difficulties. The Committee acknowledged comments from local NHS trusts that use of scales such as the MMSE made prescription monitoring and clinical audit less problematic. However, the Committee confirmed that, as in NICE technology appraisal guidance 111, when using assessment scales to determine the severity of Alzheimer's disease, healthcare professionals should take into account any physical, sensory or learning disabilities or communication difficulties that could affect the results and make any adjustments they consider appropriate. The Committee noted comments received in consultation that assessment scales such as the MMSE may not capture the severity of disease or benefit of treatment in people with a high level of education. It was aware that this group of people does not fall under the groups protected by equality legislation, but concluded that clinicians should also keep this in mind when assessing patients. Clinicians should also be mindful of the need to secure equality of access to treatment for patients from different ethnic groups, in particular those from different cultural backgrounds\n【208】 - The Committee discussed the continuation of treatment and thought it appropriate that treatment should be continued only when it is considered to be having a worthwhile effect on cognitive, global, functional or behavioural symptoms. The Committee considered comments received during consultation that a recommendation of 6-monthly reviews for treatment continuation was not evidence based and could be a misuse of NHS resources. The Committee acknowledged that among the submitted data, there was insufficient evidence to define an optimal review time although most clinical-effectiveness evidence was from 6-month trials and the economic models included the costs of 6-monthly monitoring. The Committee also assumed that good clinical practice would be to regularly review patients. The Committee considered that making recommendations on the timings of patient reviews and other implementation issues, such as switching from AChE inhibitors to memantine according to the recommendations, might be better addressed by the clinician. It concluded that patients who continue on the drug should be reviewed regularly using cognitive, global, functional and behavioural assessment and that treatment should be reviewed by an appropriate specialist team, unless there are locally agreed protocols for shared care. The Committee further concluded that carers' views on the patient's condition at follow-up should be sought\n【209】 # Summaryofthe Appraisal Committee'skeyconclusions\n【210】 - TA217\n【211】 - Appraisal title: Donezepil, galantamine, rivastigmine and memantine for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (review of NICE technology appraisal guidance 111)\n【212】 - - Key conclusion\n【213】 - The three acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine are recommended as options for managing mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease\n【214】 - The Committee noted that the key driver of cost effectiveness in the Assessment Group's model was treatment leading to delay to institutionalisation. The Committee considered that, with this assumption, the Assessment Group's model demonstrated that each of the AChE inhibitors was cost saving compared with best supportive care\n【215】 - The Committee concluded that there was insufficient evidence to differentiate between the AChE inhibitors in terms of cost effectiveness and that therefore the best use of NHS resources would be the technology with the lowest acquisition cost. The Committee further accepted that an alternative AChE inhibitor could be prescribed if it is considered appropriate when taking into account adverse event profile, expectations around adherence, medical comorbidity, possibility of drug interactions and dosing profiles\n【216】 - Memantine is recommended as an option for managing Alzheimer's disease for people with moderate Alzheimer's disease who are intolerant of or have a contraindication to AChE inhibitors, or for people with severe Alzheimer's disease\n【217】 - The Committee concluded that memantine would not be cost effective compared with the AChE inhibitors in people with moderate disease because it generated fewer QALYs at a higher cost. The Committee noted that the use of memantine in the subgroup with moderate disease would represent a cost-effective use of NHS resources only if best supportive care was the comparator\n【218】 - With regard to the severe subgroup analysis, the Committee considered that, had it been possible to include the behavioural benefit of memantine in the Assessment Group's model, the ICER would be less than £26,500 per QALY gained. It therefore concluded that treatment with memantine represented a cost-effective use of NHS resources for people with severe Alzheimer's disease\n【219】 - Current practice\n【220】 - Clinical need of patients including the availability of alternative treatments\n【221】 - The Committee was aware that there is currently no cure for Alzheimer's disease and that the AChE inhibitors and memantine treat the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease but do not slow the progression of the disease\n【222】 - The technology\n【223】 - Proposed benefits of the technology\n【224】 - The Committee concluded that new evidence provided additional support to the conclusions from 2004 that each of the AChE inhibitors offers benefits over best supportive care for cognitive, functional and global outcomes, and may offer some benefit in behavioural outcomes, although the nature and extent of behavioural benefits are uncertain\n【225】 - How innovative is the technology in its potential to make a significant and substantial impact on health-related benefits and how it might improve the way that current need is met (is this a 'step-change' in the management of the condition?)\n【226】 - The Committee concluded that memantine offers symptomatic benefit in cognitive, functional, global and behavioural outcomes, although the size of the benefit is uncertain\n【227】 - What is the position of the treatment in the pathway of care for the condition?\n【228】 - The Committee considered the current management of Alzheimer's disease under the recommendations of NICE technology appraisal guidance 111, which recommends AChE inhibitors for the treatment of moderate Alzheimer's disease. The Committee was aware of both the importance of early diagnosis and carer and clinical views on the advantages of early use of AChE inhibitors in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. The Committee heard from clinical specialists that there is variation in clinical practice and that AChE inhibitors are also used to treat some patients with an MMSE score of above 20\n【229】 - Memantine is not recommended by NICE technology appraisal guidance 111 except in the context of clinical trials\n【230】 - Adverse effects\n【231】 - The Committee stated that the adverse effects of AChE inhibitors and memantine are well documented and that overall evidence since 2004 has not changed the tolerability profile of these treatments\n【232】 - Evidence for clinical effectiveness\n【233】 - Availability, nature and quality of evidence\n【234】 - The Committee stated that a small amount of new evidence about the clinical effectiveness of the AChE inhibitors from randomised controlled trials had been published since 2004\n【235】 - The Committee considered the results of the new randomised controlled trials for memantine and the pooled results in order to estimate the size of clinical effectiveness for memantine compared with placebo or best supportive care. The Committee noted that although the new evidence considered by the Assessment Group did not substantially change the estimate of the clinical effectiveness of memantine compared with the review in 2004, the meta-analysis submitted by the manufacturer showed significant benefits\n【236】 - Relevance to general clinical practice in the NHS\n【237】 - The Committee recognised the heterogeneity of outcome measures in trials and was aware of the limitations of some of the instruments used in the clinical trials, including cognitive and behavioural scales\n【238】 - Uncertainties generated by the evidence\n【239】 - The Committee concluded that AChE inhibitors may offer some behavioural benefits although their nature and extent are uncertain owing to mixed results from available evidence\n【240】 - The Committee concluded that although there was no evidence available on health-related quality of life from a systematic review of randomised controlled clinical trials, there was some anecdotal evidence from clinical practice of benefits to patients and carers from using AChE inhibitors\n【241】 - The Committee concluded that there was no evidence to suggest that the AChE inhibitors affected survival\n【242】 - The Committee concluded that memantine offers symptomatic benefit in cognitive, functional, global and behavioural outcomes, although the size of this benefit is uncertain\n【243】 - Are there any clinically relevant subgroups for which there is evidence of differential effectiveness?\n【244】 - The Committee considered whether there were differences in cost effectiveness for particular subgroups of people with Alzheimer's disease. The Committee noted that the Assessment Group's model assumed the same treatment effect for patients with mild and moderate disease. The Committee was aware that in NICE technology appraisal guidance 111 a difference in treatment effect between mild and moderate populations was assumed in the amended base case, on the basis of analysis by the Medical Research Council Biostatistics Unit. The Committee was also aware that no subgroup analyses had been identified as part of the systematic review of clinical effectiveness analysis\n【245】 - The Committee accepted on the basis of the evidence in the manufacturer's submission and expert testimony that memantine may offer benefit to people with severe Alzheimer's disease\n【246】 - Estimate of the size of the clinical effectiveness including strength of supporting evidence\n【247】 - The Committee concluded that new evidence provided additional support to the previous conclusions from 2004 that each of the AChE inhibitors offers benefits over best supportive care for cognitive, functional and global outcomes, and may offer some benefit in behavioural outcomes, although the nature and extent of behavioural benefits are uncertain owing to mixed results from the available evidence\n【248】 - The Committee concluded that there was insufficient evidence to differentiate between the AChE inhibitors in terms of clinical effectiveness\n【249】 - The Committee concluded that combination treatment with memantine and AChE inhibitors could not be recommended because there is a lack of evidence of additional clinical efficacy compared with monotherapy\n【250】 - Evidence for cost effectiveness\n【251】 - Availability and nature of cost effectiveness evidence\n【252】 - The Committee considered economic models from the Assessment Group, the manufacturer of donepezil and the manufacturer of memantine\n【253】 - The Committee considered that only the Assessment Group addressed the decision problem in the scope because it included all of the AChE inhibitors as comparators for mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease, whereas the manufacturer of donepezil's model compared donepezil with best supportive care only. The Committee concluded that there were limitations in constructing an economic model based on time to institutionalisation but that the Assessment Group's model was based on the best currently available and detailed UK evidence to evaluate the cost effectiveness of donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine\n【254】 - The Committee considered that, on balance, the Assessment Group's model provided a suibasis for decision making. This was because the cohort data used to model disease progression were generalisable to the UK, the effectiveness data for memantine monotherapy and combination therapy with AChE inhibitors were not combined, and the cost effectiveness of memantine could be compared with that of the AChE inhibitors in moderate Alzheimer's disease\n【255】 - Uncertainties around and plausibility of assumptions and inputs in the economic model\n【256】 - The Committee was aware of the limitations of the Wolstenholme dataset including the small population, the relatively old data (collected between 1988 and 1999), which might not reflect current rates of and times to institutionalisation, and the fact that the study was based in a semi-rural location. The Committee concluded that although the Wolstenholme dataset that formed the basis of the Assessment Group's model had these limitations it still represented the best available data\n【257】 - The Committee concluded that the assumption of no survival effect from treatment with the AChE inhibitors in the base-case model was appropriate in light of the lack of evidence of survival effect from randomised controlled trials\n【258】 - The Committee concluded that although behaviour was a potential predictor of time to institutionalisation, not including it in the Assessment Group's model (which already included cognition and function) was unlikely to substantially change the outputs of the model in mild, moderate and severe Alzheimer's disease\n【259】 - Incorporation of health-related quality-of-life benefits and utility values\n【260】 - Have any potential significant and substantial health-related benefits been identified that were not included in the economic model, and how have they been considered?\n【261】 - The Committee considered whether assumptions and inputs about health-related quality of life and utilities included in the Assessment Group's model were reasonable. The Committee acknowledged that there were differences in the responses given by patients and those given by carers when reporting outcomes, but that in sensitivity analyses conducted by the Assessment Group, changes to utility values had a small impact on ICERs. The Committee concluded that the assumptions and inputs about utilities in the Assessment Group's model were appropriate\n【262】 - Are there specific groups of people for whom the technology is particularly cost effective?\n【263】 - The Committee did not consider subgroups for AChE inhibitors\n【264】 - The Committee noted that the use of memantine in the subgroup with moderate disease would represent a cost-effective use of NHS resources only if best supportive care was the comparator (that is, for people with moderate Alzheimer's disease who are intolerant of or have a contraindication to AChE inhibitors)\n【265】 - The Committee concluded that treatment with memantine represented a cost-effective use of NHS resources for people with severe Alzheimer's disease\n【266】 - What are the key drivers of cost effectiveness?\n【267】 - The Committee considered the appropriateness of the structure of the Assessment Group's model, which was based on predicting time to institutionalisation\n【268】 - Considering all the factors in relation to cognitive and functional scales, the Committee considered it appropriate to use age, cognition and function as key predictors of time to institutionalisation. The Committee concluded that although behaviour was a potential predictor of time to institutionalisation in everyday life, its omission from a model already including cognition and function was unlikely to substantially change the outputs of the model in mild and moderate Alzheimer's disease\n【269】 - The Committee noted that the key driver of cost effectiveness in the Assessment Group's model was treatment leading to delay to institutionalisation\n【270】 - Most likely cost-effectiveness estimate (given as an ICER)\n【271】 - The Committee considered that, with the assumption that the key driver of cost effectiveness in the Assessment Group's model was treatment leading to delay to institutionalisation, the Assessment Group's model demonstrated that each of the AChE inhibitors was cost saving compared with best supportive care\n【272】 - The Committee noted the small difference in absolute costs and benefits between the AChE inhibitors. It also observed that small changes in some of the inputs and assumptions had significant impacts on the incremental estimates of cost effectiveness. The Committee concluded that overall, the AChE inhibitors donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine had small but demonstrable clinical benefits and were cost-effective treatment options. The Committee concluded that there was insufficient evidence to differentiate between the AChE inhibitors in terms of cost effectiveness and that therefore the best use of NHS resources would be the technology with the lowest acquisition cost\n【273】 - The Committee considered that the base-case ICER for memantine of £32,100 per QALY gained compared with best supportive care in moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease was likely to be an overestimate of the true cost per QALY gained, although the size of this overestimation was uncertain. The Committee noted that in the Assessment Group's exploratory analysis, memantine dominated best supportive care for the moderate group, and for the severe group the ICER for memantine compared with best supportive care was £26,500 per QALY gained. The Committee concluded that memantine would not be cost effective compared with AChE inhibitors in people with moderate disease because it generated fewer QALYs at a higher cost\n【274】 - The Committee considered that, had it been possible to include the behavioural benefit of memantine in the Assessment Group's model, the ICER would be less than £26,500 per QALY gained for severe disease. It therefore concluded that treatment with memantine represented a cost-effective use of NHS resources for people with severe Alzheimer's disease\n【275】 - Additional factors taken into account\n【276】 - Patient access schemes (Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Programme)\n【277】 - Not applicable\n【278】 - End-of-life considerations\n【279】 - Equalities considerations, Social Value Judgement\n【280】 - The Committee confirmed that, as in NICE technology appraisal guidance 111, when using assessment scales to determine the severity of Alzheimer's disease, healthcare professionals should take into account any physical, sensory or learning disabilities or communication difficulties that could affect the results and make any adjustments they consider appropriate. Clinicians should also be mindful of the need to secure equality of access to treatment for patients from different ethnic groups, in particular those from different cultural backgrounds\n【281】 - The Committee recognised the difficulties of using MMSE score alone to assess the severity of Alzheimer's disease and the response to AChE inhibitors. The Committee agreed that cognitive scales alone such as the MMSE are not always appropriate for assessing the severity of dementia. The Committee concluded that if cognitive scales are not appropriate for assessing the need for treatment, or whether to continue treatment, then clinicians should use another appropriate method of assessment\n【282】 # Recommendations for further research\n【283】 - Research is needed to generate robust and relevant data on the effects of treating people with Alzheimer's disease on both short-term and long-term outcomes, disease progression through relevant health states, and quality of life\n【284】 - Research is needed on the impact of treating Alzheimer's disease on mortality and institutionalisation, and to assess the relationship between disease progression and carer utility (quality of life).# Related NICE guidance\n【285】 - Dementia: assessment, management and support for people living with dementia and their carer  NICE guideline NG97# Review of guidance\n【286】 - The guidance on this technology will be considered for review by the Guidance Executive in April 2014. NICE welcomes comment on this proposed date. The Guidance Executive will decide whether the technology should be reviewed based on information gathered by NICE, and in consultation with consultees and commentators.

Over the coming years NACI will be refining methodological approaches to include these factors. Not all NACI Statements will require in-depth analyses of all programmatic factors. As NACI works towards full implementation of the expanded mandate, select Statements will include varying degrees of programmatic analyses for public health programs\n【4】 - PHAC acknowledges that the advice and recommendations set out in this statement are based upon the best current available scientific knowledge and is disseminating this document for information purposes. People administering the vaccine should also be aware of the contents of the relevant product monograph(s). Recommendations for use and other information set out herein may differ from that set out in the product monograph(s) of the Canadian manufacturer(s) of the vaccine(s).

INTRODUCTION\n【6】 - This document, the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI): Canadian Immunization Guide Chapter on Influenza and Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccine for 2019-2020, updates NACI's recommendations regarding the use of seasonal influenza vaccines\n【7】 Based on a review of available pre-licensure clinical trial data, NACI has concluded that Afluria Tetra has a comparable safety and immunogenicity profile to already authorized quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccines. Therefore, NACI recommends that Afluria Tetra may be considered among the quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccines offered to adults and children 5 years of age and older (Discretionary NACI Recommendation). Refer to the NACI Supplemental Statement on Afluria  Tetra for additional information supporting this recommendation\n【8】 - Comparative effectiveness and immunogenicity of subunit and split virus inactivated influenza vaccines in adults 65 years of age and older Unadjuvanted subunit and split virus inactivated influenza vaccines are two commonly used types of seasonal influenza vaccines in Canada. A difference in vaccine effectiveness between these formulations would be especially important for adults 65 years of age or older, since there is evidence that older adults experience more severe illness due to influenza and that influenza vaccines are less effective in this age group, compared to younger adults. Based on a systematic review of the literature, NACI has concluded that there is insufficient evidence at this time on the comparative effectiveness and immunogenicity of unadjuvanted subunit and split virus inactivated influenza vaccines in adults 65 years of age and older to support specific recommendations on the differential use of these vaccines (Grade I Evidence). Refer to the NACI Literature Review on the Comparative Effectiveness and Immunogenicity of Subunit and Split Virus Inactivated Influenza Vaccines in Adults 65 Years of Age and Older for additional information supporting this conclusion\n【9】 # Updated presentation of the statement\n【10】 - The presentation of this document has been updated from previous seasons' statements to improve readability. The content in some sections has been reduced in length, while maintaining a focus on key information required for decision making. Links to other published NACI documents containing the additional content removed from the statement have been added\n【11】 # Updated abbreviations for influenza vaccines\n【12】 - With the availability of many different influenza vaccines in Canada, the abbreviations used in this document have been updated to describe the defining features of the various types of influenza vaccines better. The new NACI abbreviations are as follows: Abbreviations: IIV: inactivated influenza vaccine; IIV3: trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine; IIV3-Adj: adjuvanted trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine; IIV3-HD: high-dose trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine; IIV3-SD: standarddose trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine; IIV4: quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine; IIV4-SD: standard-dose quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine; IM: intramuscular; LAIV: live attenuated influenza vaccine; LAIV3: trivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine; LAIV4: quadrivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine. - The numeric suffix denotes the number of antigens contained in the vaccine (\"3\" refers to the trivalent formulation and \"4\" refers to the quadrivalent formulation). The hyphenated suffix \"-SD\" is used when referring to IIV products that do not have an adjuvant, contain 15 µg hemagglutinin (HA) per strain and are administered as a 0.5 mL dose by intramuscular injection; \"-Adj\" refers to an IIV with an adjuvant (e.g., IIV3-Adj for Fluad  or Fluad Pediatric  ); and \"-HD\" refers to an IIV that contains higher antigen content than 15 µg HA per strain (e.g., IIV3-HD for Fluzone  High-Dose).  15 µg HA per strain. ‡ 7.5 µg (in 0.25 mL) or 15 µg (in 0.5 mL) HA per strain.  60 µg HA per strain\n【13】 # Influenza vaccine category\n【14】 - Formulation\n【15】 # I.2 Background\n【16】 - The World Health Organization's (WHO) recommendations on the composition of influenza virus vaccines are typically available in February of each year for the upcoming season in the Northern Hemisphere. The WHO recommends that, where available, seasonal quadrivalent influenza vaccines contain the recommended three viruses for the trivalent vaccine, as well as the influenza B virus lineage that is not included in the trivalent vaccine\n【17】 - Annual recommendations on the use of influenza vaccine in Canada are developed by the NACI Influenza Working Group (IWG) for consideration by NACI. Recommendations are developed based on a review of a variety of issues, which can include: the burden of influenza illness and the target populations for vaccination; efficacy, effectiveness, immunogenicity, and safety of influenza vaccines; vaccine schedules; and other aspects of influenza immunization. Details regarding NACI's evidence-based process for developing a statement are outlined in Evidencebased Recommendations for Immunization − Methods of the National Advisory Committee on Immunization\n【18】 - Health care providers in Canada should offer the seasonal influenza vaccine as soon as feasible after it becomes available in the fall, since seasonal influenza activity may start as early as November in the Northern Hemisphere. Decisions regarding the precise timing of vaccination in a given setting or geographic area should be made according to local epidemiologic factors (influenza activity, timing, and intensity), opportune moments for vaccination, as well as programmatic considerations. Further advice regarding the timing of influenza vaccination programs may be obtained through consultation with local public health agencies\n【19】 - Although vaccination before the onset of the influenza season is strongly preferred, vaccine may still be administered up until the end of the season. Although its utility may be compromised if exposure to influenza has already occurred, vaccine providers should use every opportunity to give influenza vaccine to individuals at risk who have not been immunized during the current season, even after influenza activity has been documented in the community\n【20】 # II. CANADIAN IMMUNIZATION GUIDE CHAPTER ON INFLUENZA: CLINICAL INFORMATION FOR VACCINE PROVIDERS\n【21】 - The Canadian Immunization Guide (CIG) is written primarily for health care providers (frontline clinicians and public health practitioners) but is also used by policy makers, program planners, and the general public. The CIG has been a trusted, reader-friendly summary of the vaccine statements provided by NACI since 1979\n【22】 - The information in this section constitutes the influenza chapter of the CIG and is adapted for inclusion in the NACI Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccine. With a new NACI Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccine required each year, readers will have quick access to the information that they require within one document, whether it is the relevant influenza vaccine information written primarily for frontline vaccine providers as is found in this section, or the more detailed technical information that is found in the rest of this statement, commencing in III\n【23】 # II.1 Key Information\n【24】 - The following highlights key information for vaccine providers. Please  the remainder of this statement for additional details\n【25】 # What\n【26】 - Influenza is a respiratory infection caused primarily by influenza A and B viruses. In Canada, influenza generally occurs each year in the late fall and winter months. Influenza occurs globally with an annual attack rate estimated at 5-10% in adults and 20-30% in children\n【27】 - Symptoms of influenza typically include: sudden onset of fever, cough, and muscle aches. Other common symptoms include: headache, chills, loss of appetite, fatigue, and sore throat. Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea may also occur, especially in children. Most people will recover within a week or 10 days, but some are at greater risk of more severe complications, such as pneumonia. People with chronic diseases may have worsening of their underlying disease\n【28】 - Both inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) and live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) are authorized for use in Canada; some protect against 3 strains of influenza (i.e., trivalent formulation, IIV3) and some protect against 4 strains of influenza (i.e., quadrivalent formulation, IIV4 or LAIV4)\n【29】 - Influenza vaccine is safe and well-tolerated. Influenza vaccine cannot cause influenza illness because inactivated influenza vaccines do not contain live virus and live attenuated influenza vaccines contain weakened viruses\n【30】 # Who\n【31】 - NACI makes the following recommendations for individual-level and public health program-level decision making\n【32】 # Recommendation for individual-level decision making\n【33】 (i.e., individuals wishing to protect themselves from influenza or vaccine providers wishing to advise individual patients about preventing influenza)\n【34】 - NACI recommends that influenza vaccine should be offered annually to anyone 6 months of age and older who does not have contraindications to the vaccine, with focus on the groups for whom influenza vaccination is particularly recommended . These groups include:\n【35】 - people at high risk of influenza-related complications or hospitalization; -people capable of transmitting influenza to those at high risk; -people who provide essential community services; and -people in direct contact with poultry infected with avian influenza during culling operations\n【36】 - Influenza vaccine is less immunogenic in infants less than 6 months of age than in older children and adults and does not confer sufficient protection to make it useful before 6 months of age  . Currently available influenza vaccines are not authorized for use for infants less than 6 months of age. For these reasons, NACI recommends that influenza vaccine should not be offered to infants less than 6 months of age, noting that influenza vaccine should be offered to their household contacts and care providers\n【37】 # Recommendation for public health program-level decision-making\n【38】 (i.e., provinces/territories making decisions for publicly funded immunization programs)\n【39】 - The national goal of the annual influenza immunization programs in Canada is to prevent serious illness caused by influenza and its complications, including death. Programmatic decisions to provide influenza vaccination to target populations as part of publicly funded provincial and territorial programs depend on many factors, such as cost-effectiveness evaluation and other programmatic and operational factors\n【40】 - NACI recommends that influenza vaccine should be offered as a priority to the groups for whom influenza vaccination is particularly recommended\n【41】 # List 1: Groups for whom influenza vaccination is particularly recommended\n【42】 - People at high risk of influenza-related complications or hospitalization\n【43】 # People capable of transmitting influenza to those at high risk\n【44】 - Health care and other care providers in facilities and community settings who, through their activities, are capable of transmitting influenza to those at high risk; - Household contacts, both adults and children, of individuals at high risk, whether or not the individual at high risk has been vaccinated: -household contacts of individuals at high risk; -household contacts of infants less than 6 months of age, as these infants are at high risk but cannot receive influenza vaccine; -members of a household expecting a newborn during the influenza season; - Those providing regular child care to children 6-59 months of age, whether in or out of the home; and - Those who provide services within closed or relatively closed settings to people at high risk (e.g., crew on a ship)\n【45】 # Others\n【46】 - People who provide essential community services; and\n【47】 - People who are in direct contact with poultry infected with avian influenza during culling operations. 11\n【48】 # How\n【49】 - Benefits and risks of influenza vaccination, as well as the risks of not being immunized, should be discussed prior to vaccination\n【50】 # Choice of influenza vaccine\n【51】 - A variety of influenza vaccines are available for use in Canada, some of which are authorized for use only in specific age groups. Therefore, the choice of influenza vaccine has become more complex. Refer to II.5 below for recommendations on choice of influenza vaccine by age group\n【52】 # Dose and route of administration\n【53】 - The dose and route of administration varies by product :\n【54】 - MF59-adjuvanted trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV3-Adj; Fluad Pediatric  ) for children 6-23 months of age is 0.25 mL by intramuscular (IM) injection;\n【55】 - All other IIVs for all age groups is 0.5 mL by IM injection; and\n【56】 - LAIV (FluMist  Quadrivalent) for people 2-59 years of age is 0.2 mL given intranasally (0.1 mL in each nostril)\n【57】 # Schedule\n【58】 - NACI recommends that:\n【59】 - Children 9 years of age and older and adults should receive 1 dose of influenza vaccine each year; and\n【60】 - Children 6 months to less than 9 years of age receiving seasonal influenza vaccine for the first time in their life should be given 2 doses of influenza vaccine, with a minimum interval of 4 weeks between doses. Children 6 months to less than 9 years of age who have been properly vaccinated with one or more doses of seasonal influenza vaccine in the past should receive 1 dose of influenza vaccine per season thereafter\n【61】 # Contraindications\n【62】 - For all influenza vaccines (IIV and LAIV), NACI recommends that influenza vaccination should not be given to:\n【63】 - People who have had an anaphylactic reaction to a previous dose of influenza vaccine;\n【64】 - People who have had an anaphylactic reaction to any of the vaccine components, with the exception of egg ( II.7 below for more information); -If an individual is found to have an allergy to a component in one influenza vaccine, consideration may be given to offering another influenza vaccine if there is a formulation not containing the implicated component, in consultation with an allergy expert. Individuals who have an allergy to substances that are not components of the influenza vaccine are not at increased risk of allergy to influenza vaccine. -Egg allergy is not a contraindication for influenza vaccination as there is a low risk of adverse events associated with the trace amounts of ovalbumin allowed in influenza vaccines manufactured using eggs. Egg-allergic individuals may be vaccinated against influenza using any age-appropriate product, including LAIV, without prior influenza vaccine skin test and with the full dose, irrespective of a past severe reaction to egg, and in any setting where vaccines are routinely administered. -As with any vaccine product, vaccine providers should be prepared for and have the necessary equipment to respond to a vaccine emergency at all times\n【65】 - People who have developed Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) within 6 weeks of a previous influenza vaccination ( II.7 below for more information)\n【66】 - The potential risk of GBS recurrence associated with influenza vaccination must be balanced against the risk of GBS associated with influenza infection itself and the benefits of influenza vaccination\n【67】 - For LAIV, in addition to the above-mentioned contraindications, NACI also recommends that LAIV should not be given to:\n【68】 - People with immune compromising conditions, due to underlying disease, therapy, or both, as the vaccine contains live attenuated virus;\n【69】 - People with severe asthma (defined as currently on oral or high-dose inhaled glucocorticosteroids or active wheezing) or medically attended wheezing in the 7 days prior to the proposed date of vaccination; -LAIV is not contraindicated for people with a history of sasthma or recurrent wheeze\n【70】 - Children less than 24 months of age, due to increased risk of wheezing\n【71】 - Children 2-17 years of age currently receiving aspirin or aspirin-containing therapy, because of the association of Reye's syndrome with aspirin and wild-type influenza infection; -Aspirin-containing products in children less than 18 years of age should be delayed for 4 weeks after receipt of LAIV\n【72】 - Pregnant women, because it is a live attenuated vaccine and there is a lack of safety data at this time; -LAIV is not contraindicated in breastfeeding mothers\n【73】 - Refer to Contents of Immunizing Agents Available for Use in Canada in Part 1 of the CIG for a list of all vaccines authorized for use in Canada and their contents and to Vaccine Safety in Part 2 of the CIG for information regarding the management of adverse events, including anaphylaxis\n【74】 # Precautions\n【75】 - NACI recommends that:\n【76】 - Influenza vaccination should usually be postponed in people with serious acute illnesses until their symptoms have abated; -Vaccination should not be delayed because of minor acute illness, with or without fever\n【77】 - If significant nasal congestion is present that might impede delivery of LAIV to the nasopharyngeal mucosa, IIV can be administered or LAIV can be deferred until resolution of the congestion;\n【78】 - LAIV recipients should avoid close association with people with severe immune compromising conditions (e.g., bone marrow transplant recipients requiring isolation) for at least 2 weeks following vaccination, because of the theoretical risk for transmitting a vaccine virus and causing infection; and\n【79】 - LAIV should not be administered until 48 hours after antiviral agents active against influenza (e.g., oseltamivir, zanamivir) are stopped, and those antiviral agents, unless medically indicated, should not be administered until 2 weeks after receipt of LAIV so that the antiviral agents do not kill the replicating vaccine virus\n【80】 - If antiviral agents are administered within this time frame (i.e., from 48 hours before to 2 weeks after LAIV is given), revaccination should take place at least 48 hours after the antivirals are stopped, or IIV could be given at any time\n【81】 - Refer to II.8 below for additional information on influenza vaccine-related precautions\n【82】 # Simultaneous administration with other vaccines\n【83】 - NACI recommends that:\n【84】 - All seasonal influenza vaccines, including LAIV, may be considered for administration at the same time as, or at any time before or after, administration of other live attenuated or inactivated vaccines ; and\n【85】 - Different injection sites and separate needles and syringes should be used for concomitant parenteral injections\n【86】 # Why\n【87】 - Vaccination is the most effective way to prevent influenza and its complications\n【88】 - Annual vaccination is required because the specific strains in the vaccine are reviewed each year by WHO and often changed to provide a better match against the viruses expected to circulate, and because the body's immune response to influenza vaccination is transient and unlikely to persist beyond a year\n【89】 # II.2 Epidemiology Disease description\n【90】 - Influenza is a respiratory illness caused by the influenza A and B viruses and can cause mild to severe illness, which can result in hospitalization or death. Certain populations, such as young children, older adults, and those with chronic health conditions, may be at higher risk for serious influenza complications such as viral pneumonia, secondary bacterial pneumonia, and worsening of underlying medical conditions\n【91】 # Infectious agent\n【92】 - There Over time, antigenic variation (antigenic drift) of strains occurs within an influenza A subtype or a B lineage. The ever-present possibility of antigenic drift, which may occur in one or more influenza virus strains, requires seasonal influenza vaccines to be reformulated annually, with one or more vaccine strains changing in most seasons\n【93】 # Transmission\n【94】 - Influenza is primarily transmitted by droplets spread through coughing or sneezing and through direct or indirect contact with respiratory secretions. The incubation period of seasonal influenza is usually 2 days but can range from 1-4 days. Adults may be able to spread influenza to others from 1 day before symptom onset to approximately 5 days after symptoms start. Children and people with weakened immune systems may be infectious longer\n【95】 # Risk factors\n【96】 - The people at greatest risk of influenza-related complications are adults and children with chronic health conditions , residents of nursing homes and other chronic care facilities, adults 65 years of age and older, children 6-59 months of age, pregnant women, and Indigenous peoples\n【97】 # Seasonal and temporal patterns\n【98】 - Influenza activity in Canada is usually low in the late spring and summer, begins to increase over the fall, and peaks in the winter months. Depending on the year, the peak may occur as early as fall or as late as spring\n【99】 # Spectrum of clinical illness\n【100】 - Symptoms typically include the sudden onset of fever, cough, and muscle aches. Other common symptoms include headache, chills, loss of appetite, fatigue, and sore throat. Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea may also occur, especially in children. Most people will recover within a week or 10 days. However, adults and children with chronic health conditions, adults 65 years of age and older, and children 6-59 months of age are at greater risk of more severe complications or worsening of their underlying condition\n【101】 # Disease incidence\n【102】 # Global\n【103】 - Worldwide, annual epidemics result in approximately one billion cases of influenza, three to five million cases of severe illness, and 290,000 to 650,000 deaths. For current international influenza activity information,  WHO's FluNet website\n【104】 # National\n【105】 - Together, influenza and pneumonia are ranked among the top 10 leading causes of death in Canada  . FluWatch is Canada's national influenza surveillance system that collects data and information from various sources to provide a national picture of influenza activity. Since the 2010-2011 season, an average of 30,000 laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza are reported to FluWatch each year. Although the burden of influenza can vary from year to year, it is estimated that there are an average of 12,200 hospitalizations related to influenza and approximately 3,500 deaths attributo influenza annually  . Current influenza activity information can be found on the FluWatch website\n【106】 - It should be noted that the incidence of influenza is often underreported since the illness may be confused with other viral illnesses and many people with influenza-like illness (ILI) do not seek medical care or have viral diagnostic testing done\n【107】 # II.3 Vaccine Products Available for Use in Canada\n【108】 - This section describes the influenza vaccine products that are available for use in Canada for the 2019-2020 season. All influenza vaccines available in Canada have been authorized by Health Canada. However, not all products authorized for use are necessarily available in the marketplace. The vaccine manufacturers determine whether they will make any or all of their products available in a given market. Provincial and territorial health authorities then determine which of the available products will be used in their respective publicly funded influenza immunization programs and for which population groups\n【109】 - The antigenic characteristics of circulating influenza virus strains provide the basis for selecting the strains included in each year's vaccine. Vaccine selection by the WHO generally occurs more than 6 months prior to the start of the influenza season to allow time for the vaccine manufacturers to produce the required quantity of vaccine. All manufacturers that distribute influenza vaccine products in Canada confirm to Health Canada that the vaccines to be marketed in Canada for the upcoming influenza season contain the WHO-recommended antigenic strains for the Northern Hemisphere. Vaccine producers may use antigenically equivalent strains because of their growth properties\n【110】 - There are two categories of influenza vaccine authorized for use in Canada: inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) and live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). Trivalent (3 strain) vaccines contain one A(H1N1) strain, one A(H3N2) strain, and one influenza B strain from one of the two lineages. Quadrivalent (4 strain) vaccines contain the strains in the trivalent vaccine plus an influenza B strain from the other lineage. All influenza vaccines currently authorized for use in Canada are made from influenza viruses grown in eggs\n【111】 - A summary of the characteristics of influenza vaccines available in Canada can be found in A. For complete prescribing information, readers should consult the product leaflet or information contained within the product monographs available through Health Canada's Drug Product Database\n【112】 # Standard-doseinactivatedinfluenzavaccine( IIV-SD)\n【113】 - The standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV-SDs) currently authorized for use in Canada are a mix of split virus and subunit vaccines. In split virus vaccines, the virus has been disrupted by a detergent. In subunit vaccines, HA and NA have been further purified by removal of other viral components. These vaccines are unadjuvanted, contain 15 µg HA per strain, and are administered as a 0.5 mL dose by IM injection. Refer to Basic Immunology and Vaccinology in Part 1 of the CIG for more information about inactivated vaccines\n【114】 - Both trivalent (IIV3-SD; Agriflu  , Fluviral  , and Influvac  ) and quadrivalent (IIV4-SD; Afluria  Tetra, Flulaval  Tetra, and Fluzone  Quadrivalent) products are available\n【115】 # Adjuvantedinactivatedinfluenzavaccine( IIV-Adj)\n【116】 - The adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV-Adj) currently authorized for use in Canada is a subunit IIV that contains the adjuvant MF59, which is an oil-in-water emulsion composed of squalene as the oil phase that is stabilized with the surfactants polysorbate 80 and sorbitan triolate in citrate buffer. IIV-Adj contains 7.5 µg HA per strain administered as a 0.25 mL dose by IM injection for children 6-23 months of age or 15 µg HA per strain administered as a 0.5 mL dose by IM injection for adults 65 years of age and older. Other IIVs do not contain an adjuvant\n【117】 - Trivalent products (IIV3-Adj) for children 6-23 months of age (Fluad Pediatric  ) and adults 65 years of age and older (Fluad  ) are available\n【118】 # High-doseinactivatedinfluenzavaccine( IIV-HD)\n【119】 - The high-dose inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV-HD) currently authorized for use in Canada is an unadjuvanted, split virus IIV that contains 60 µg HA per strain and is administered as a 0.5 mL dose by IM injection\n【120】 - A trivalent product (IIV3-HD; Fluzone  High-Dose) for adults 65 years of age and older is available\n【121】 # Liveattenuatedinfluenzavaccine( LAIV)\n【122】 - LAIV is given as an intranasal spray. The influenza viruses contained in LAIV are attenuated so that they do not cause influenza and are cold-adapted and temperature sensitive, so that they replicate in the nasal mucosa rather than the lower respiratory tract. LAIV contains standardized quantities of fluorescent focus units (FFU) of live attenuated reassortants and is given as a 0.2 mL dose (0.1 mL in each nostril)\n【123】 - A quadrivalent product (LAIV4; FluMist  Quadrivalent) is authorized for use in Canada for children 2-17 years of age and adults 18-59 years of age. The trivalent formulation (LAIV3) is no longer available in Canada\n【124】 # II.4 Efficacy, Effectiveness, and Immunogenicity Efficacy and effectiveness\n【125】 - Influenza vaccine has been shown in randomized controlled clinical trials to be efficacious in providing protection against influenza infection and illness. However, the effectiveness of the vaccine-that is, how it performs in settings that are more reflective of usual health care practicecan vary from season to season and by influenza vaccine strain type and subtype\n【126】 - Influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) depends on how well the vaccine strains match with circulating influenza viruses, the type and subtype, as well as the health and age of the individual receiving the vaccine. Even when there is a less-than-ideal match or lower effectiveness against one strain, the possibility of lower VE should not preclude vaccination, particularly for people at high risk of influenza-related complications and hospitalization, since vaccinated individuals are still more likely to be protected compared to those who are unvaccinated\n【127】 # Immunogenicity\n【128】 - Antibody response after vaccination depends on several factors, including the age of the recipient, prior and subsequent exposure to antigens, and the presence of immune compromising conditions. Protective levels of humoral antibodies, which correlate with protection against influenza infection, are generally achieved by 2 weeks after vaccination; however, there may be some protection afforded before that time\n【129】 # II.5 Choice of Seasonal Influenza Vaccine\n【130】 - The decision to include specific influenza vaccines as part of publicly funded provincial and territorial programs depends on several factors, such as cost-effectiveness evaluation and other programmatic and operational factors, such as implementation strategies. Not all products will be made available in all jurisdictions and availability of some products may be limited; therefore, officials in individual provinces and territories should be consulted regarding the products available in individual jurisdictions\n【131】 - With the availability of influenza vaccines that are designed to enhance immunogenicity in specific age groups or given through a different route of administration, the choice of product has become more complex\n【132】 # Choice of influenza vaccine by age group\n【133】 - Recommendations for individual-level decision making\n【134】 - NACI recommends that influenza vaccine should be offered annually to anyone 6 months of age and older who does not have contraindications to the vaccine.  provides age group-specific recommendations for the age-appropriate influenza vaccine types available for use in Canada\n【135】 # Recommendations for public health program-level decision making\n【136】 - NACI recommends that any of the age-appropriate influenza vaccine types available for use may be considered for people without contraindications to the vaccine.  provides age group-specific recommendations for the age-appropriate influenza vaccine types available in Canada\n【137】 - IIV3-SD - IIV3-Adj - IIV4-SD\n【138】 - Quadrivalent influenza vaccine should be used, given the burden of influenza B disease in this age group and the potential for lineage mismatch between the predominant circulating strain of influenza B and the strain in a trivalent vaccine\n【139】 - If a quadrivalent vaccine is not available, any of the available trivalent vaccines should be used\n【140】 # 2-17 years \n【141】 - IIV3-SD - IIV4-SD - LAIV4\n【142】 - Either IIV4-SD or LAIV4 should be used in children without contraindications, including those with non-immune compromising chronic health conditions, given the burden of influenza B disease in this age group and the potential for lineage mismatch between the predominant circulating strain of influenza B and the strain in a trivalent vaccine\n【143】 - If IIV4-SD or LAIV4 is not available, IIV3-SD should be used\n【144】 - IIV4-SD should be used for children for whom LAIV is contraindicated, such as in children with: -severe asthma; -medically attended wheezing in the 7 days prior to vaccination; -current receipt of aspirin or aspirin-containing therapy; and -immune compromising conditions\n【145】 # Recipient by age group\n【146】 # II.6 Vaccine Administration\n【147】 - Dose, route of administration, and schedule\n【148】 - With the variety of influenza vaccines available for use in Canada, it is important for vaccine providers to note the specific differences in age indication, route of administration, dosage and schedule for the products that they will be using . Key relevant details and differences between vaccine products are also highlighted in A\n【149】 - For influenza vaccines given by the IM route, the deltoid muscle is the recommended site in adults and children 12 months of age and older, and the anterolateral thigh is the recommended site in children 6-12 months of age. For more information on vaccine administration, please  Vaccine Administration Practices in Part 1 of the CIG.  Evidence suggests moderate improvement in antibody response in infants, without an increase in reactogenicity, with the use of full vaccine doses (0.5 mL) for unadjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccines  . This moderate improvement in antibody response without an increase in reactogenicity is the basis for the full dose recommendation for unadjuvanted inactivated vaccine for all ages. For more information,  Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccine for 2011-2012.  Children 6 months to less than 9 years of age receiving seasonal influenza vaccine for the first time in their life should be given 2 doses of influenza vaccine, with a minimum interval of 4 weeks between doses. Children 6 months to less than 9 years of age who have been properly vaccinated with one or more doses of seasonal influenza vaccine in the past should receive 1 dose of influenza vaccine per season thereafter\n【150】 # Booster doses and revaccination\n【151】 - Booster doses are not required within the same influenza season. However, children 6 months to less than 9 years of age who have not previously received the seasonal influenza vaccine require 2 doses of influenza vaccine, with a minimum of 4 weeks between doses\n【152】 # Serological testing\n【153】 - Serologic testing is not necessary before or after receiving seasonal influenza vaccine\n【154】 # Storage requirements\n【155】 # Simultaneous administration with other vaccines\n【156】 - In theory, the administration of two live vaccines sequentially within less than 4 weeks could reduce the efficacy of the second vaccine4 of this statement\n【157】 - Given the lack of data for immune interference, and based on expert opinion, NACI recommends that LAIV can be given together with or at any time before or after the administration of any other live attenuated or inactivated vaccine. NACI recognizes that some vaccine providers may choose to give LAIV and other live vaccines simultaneously or separated by at least 4 weeks if a delay is chosen. Alternatively, an IIV may be given. Note that the timing rules related to two parenteral live vaccines (e.g., MMR and varicella vaccines) still apply. For more information regarding vaccination administration timing rules, please  Timing of Vaccine Administration in Part 1 of the CIG\n【158】 - When more than one injection is given at a single clinic visit, it is preferable to administer them in different limbs. If it is not possible to do so, injections given in one limb should be separated by a distance of at least 2.5 cm (1 inch). A separate needle and syringe should be used for each injection\n【159】 - The target groups for influenza and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines overlap considerably. Vaccine providers should take the opportunity to vaccinate eligible people against pneumococcal disease when influenza vaccine is given\n【160】 # II.7 Vaccine Safety and Adverse Events\n【161】 - Data from post-marketing surveillance of influenza vaccines in Canada (Canadian Adverse Events Following Immunization Surveillance System ) have shown seasonal influenza vaccines to have a safe and sprofile for adverse events following immunization (AEFIs) with no unexpected events\n【162】 - All influenza vaccines currently authorized for use in Canada are considered safe for use in people with latex allergies. The multi-dose vial formulations of inactivated influenza vaccine that are authorized for use in Canada contain minute quantities of thimerosal, which is used as a preservative  . All single dose formulations of IIV and LAIV are thimerosal-free. Refer to Vaccine Safety in Part 2 of the CIG for additional information\n【163】 # Common adverse events\n【164】 - With IM administered influenza vaccines, injection site reactions are common but are generally classified as mild and transient. IIV3-Adj tends to produce more extensive injection site reactions than unadjuvanted IIV3, but these reactions are also generally mild and resolve spontaneously within a few days. IIV3-HD tends to induce higher rates of systemic reactions post-injection compared to IIV3-SD, but most of these reactions are mild and short-lived. The most common adverse events experienced by recipients of LAIV3 are nasal congestion and runny nose, which are also reported for LAIV4. Refer to the relevant subsections of IV for additional information\n【165】 - Less common and serious or severe adverse events Serious adverse events are rare following influenza vaccination, and in most cases, data are insufficient to determine a causal association. Allergic responses to influenza vaccine are a rare consequence of hypersensitivity to some vaccine components. Refer to II.8 below for additional information\n【166】 - Other reported adverse events and conditions\n【167】 # Guillain-Barré syndrome\n【168】 - Studies suggest that the absolute risk of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) in the period following seasonal and A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza vaccination is about one excess case per million vaccinations, and that the risk of GBS associated with influenza illness is larger (about 17 cases per million influenza-coded health care encounters, which are a proxy for influenza illness) than that associated with influenza vaccination\n【169】 - Although the evidence considering influenza vaccination and GBS is inadequate to accept or reject a causal relation between GBS in adults and seasonal influenza vaccination, avoiding subsequent influenza vaccination of individuals known to have had GBS without other known etiology within 6 weeks of a previous influenza vaccination appears prudent at this time. However, the potential risk of GBS recurrence associated with influenza vaccination must be balanced against the risk of GBS associated with influenza infection itself and the benefits of influenza vaccination\n【170】 # Oculorespiratory syndrome\n【171】 - Oculorespiratory syndrome (ORS), which is defined as the presence of bilateral red eyes and one or more associated symptoms (cough, wheeze, chest tightness, difficulty breathing, difficulty swallowing, hoarseness, or sore throat) that starts within 24 hours of vaccination, with or without facial edema, was found during the 2000-2001 influenza season; few cases have been reported since then. ORS is not considered to be an allergic response. People who have a recurrence of ORS upon revaccination do not necessarily experience further episodes with future vaccinations\n【172】 - Individuals who have experienced ORS without lower respiratory tract symptoms may be safely revaccinated with influenza vaccine. Individuals who experienced ORS with lower respiratory tract symptoms should have an expert review. Health care providers who are unsure whether an individual previously experienced ORS versus an immunoglobulin E (IgE) mediated hypersensitivity immune response should seek advice. Data on clinically significant adverse events do not support the preference of one vaccine product over another when revaccinating those who have previously experienced ORS\n【173】 # Allergic reactions to previous vaccine doses\n【174】 - Expert review of the benefits and risks of vaccination should be sought for those who have previously experienced severe lower respiratory symptoms (wheeze, chest tightness, difficulty breathing) within 24 hours of influenza vaccination, an apparent significant allergic reaction to the vaccine, or any other symptoms that could indicate a significant allergic reaction (e.g., throat constriction, difficulty swallowing) that raise concern regarding the safety of revaccination. This advice may be obtained from experts in infectious disease, allergy, and immunology, or public health\n【175】 - In view of the considerable morbidity and mortality associated with influenza, a diagnosis of influenza vaccine allergy should not be made without confirmation, which may involve consultation with an allergy or immunology expert\n【176】 # Drug interactions\n【177】 - Although influenza vaccine can inhibit the clearance of warfarin and theophylline, clinical studies have not shown any adverse effects attributo these drugs in people receiving influenza vaccine. Statins have effects on the immune system in addition to their therapeutic cholesterollowering actions. Two published studies have found that adults who are regular statin users (at least 65 years of age in one study and 45 years and older in the other) had an apparent decreased response to influenza vaccination as measured by reduced geometric mean titres (GMT)  or reduced VE against medically attended acute respiratory illness  . Statins are widely used in the same adult populations who are also at-risk for influenza-related complications and hospitalizations. Therefore, if these preliminary findings are confirmed in future studies, concomitant statin use in adult populations could have implications for influenza VE and how this use is assessed in the measurement of VE. NACI will continue to monitor the literature related to this issue\n【178】 # Guidanceonreportingadverseeventsfollowingimmunization( AEFI)\n【179】 - To ensure the ongoing safety of influenza vaccines in Canada, reporting of AEFIs by vaccine providers and other clinicians is critical, and in some jurisdictions, reporting is mandatory under the law\n【180】 - Vaccine providers are asked to report AEFIs through local public health officials and to check for specific AEFI reporting requirements in their province or territory. An AEFI is any untoward medical occurrence that follows vaccination and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the usage of a vaccine. The adverse event may be any unfavourable or unintended sign, abnormal laboratory finding, symptom, or disease. In general, any serious or unexpected adverse event felt to be temporally related to vaccination should be reported. An unexpected AEFI is an event that is not listed in the approved product monograph but may be due to the vaccination, or a change in the nature, severity, specificity, or outcome of a known AEFI\n【181】 - For influenza vaccines, the following AEFIs are of particular interest:\n【182】 - ORS; and\n【183】 - GBS within 6 weeks following vaccination\n【184】 - Refer to Reporting Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI) in Canada for additional information about AEFI reporting and to Vaccine Safety in Part 2 of the CIG for general vaccine safety information\n【185】 # II.8 Travellers\n【186】 - Influenza occurs year-round in the tropics. In temperate northern and southern countries, influenza activity generally peaks during the winter season (November to March in the Northern Hemisphere and April to October in the Southern Hemisphere)\n【187】 - NACI recommends that influenza vaccine should be offered annually to anyone 6 months of age and older, including travellers, who does not have contraindications to the vaccine, with focus on the groups for whom influenza vaccination is particularly recommended\n【188】 - Vaccines prepared specifically for use in the Southern Hemisphere are not available in Canada, and the extent to which recommended vaccine components for the Southern Hemisphere may overlap with those in available Canadian formulations will vary. A decision for or against revaccination (i.e., boosting) of travellers to the Southern Hemisphere between April and October, if they had already been vaccinated in the preceding fall or winter with the Northern Hemisphere's vaccine, depends on individual risk assessment, the similarity or difference between the Northern and Southern Hemisphere vaccines, the similarity or difference between the Northern Hemisphere vaccine strains and currently circulating strains in the Southern Hemisphere, and the availability of a reliable and safe vaccine at the traveller's destination\n【189】 - Refer to Immunization of Travellers in Part 3 of the CIG for additional general information\n【190】 - This concludes the summary of relevant influenza vaccine information typically found in the CIG. Additional technical information related to seasonal influenza vaccine can be found in the remainder of this statement\n【191】 # III. PARTICULARLY RECOMMENDED VACCINE RECIPIENTS: ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n【192】 - The groups for whom influenza vaccination is particularly recommended are presented in List 1 of II. Additional information regarding these particularly recommended recipients is provided below\n【193】 # III.1 People at High Risk of Influenza-Related Complications or Hospitalization\n【194】 - All pregnant women NACI recommends the inclusion of all pregnant women, at any stage of pregnancy, among the particularly recommended recipients of IIV, due to the risk of influenza-associated morbidity in pregnant women  , evidence of adverse neonatal outcomes associated with maternal respiratory hospitalization or influenza during pregnancy  , evidence that vaccination of pregnant women protects their newborns from influenza and influenza-related hospitalization  , and evidence that infants born during influenza season to vaccinated women are less likely to be premature, small for gestational age, and of low birth weight\n【195】 - The safety of IIV during pregnancy has been reviewed  . Active studies of influenza vaccination during pregnancy have not shown evidence of harm to the mother or fetus associated with influenza immunization  . Although the cumulative sample size of active studies of influenza vaccination in pregnant women is relatively small, particularly in the first trimester, passive surveillance has not raised any safety concerns despite widespread use of IIV during pregnancy over several decades\n【196】 # Adults and children with chronic health conditions\n【197】 - A number of chronic health conditions, as noted in List 1, are associated with increased risk of influenza-related complications, and influenza can lead to exacerbation of the chronic disease. Influenza vaccination can induce protective antibody levels in a substantial proportion of adults and children with immune compromising conditions, including transplant recipients, those with proliferative diseases of the hematopoietic and lymphatic systems, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected people. Vaccine effectiveness may be lower in people with immune compromising conditions than in healthy adults\n【198】 # Neurologic or neurodevelopment conditions\ns\n【200】 # People of any age who are residents of nursing homes and other chronic care facilities\n【201】 - Residents of nursing homes and other chronic care facilities often have one or more chronic health conditions and live in institutional environments that may facilitate the spread of influenza\n【202】 # Adults 65 years of age and older\n【203】 - Hospitalization attributo influenza in this age group is estimated at 125-228 per 100,000 healthy people  , and influenza-attributed mortality rates increase with increased age\n【204】 # All children 6-59 months of age\n【205】 - On the basis of existing data, NACI recommends the inclusion of all children 6-59 months of age among the particularly recommended recipients of influenza vaccine\n【206】 # Indigenous peoples\n【207】 - Based on the body of evidence indicating a higher rate of influenza-associated hospitalization and death among Indigenous peoples, NACI recommends the inclusion of this population among the particularly recommended recipients of influenza vaccine\n【208】 # III.2 People Capable of Transmitting Influenza to Those at High Risk of Influenza-Related Complications or Hospitalization\n【209】 - People who are potentially capable of transmitting influenza to those at high risk should receive annual vaccination, regardless of whether the high-risk individual has been immunized. Immunization of care providers decreases their own risk of illness\n【210】 - People who are more likely to transmit influenza to those at high risk of influenza-related complications or hospitalization include:\n【211】 - Health care and other care providers in facilities and community settings who, through their activities, are capable of transmitting influenza to those at high risk; and - Contacts, both adults and children, of individuals at high risk, whether or not the individual at high risk has been vaccinated\n【212】 # Health care and other providers in facilities and community settings\n【213】 - This group includes HCWs, regular visitors, emergency response workers, and others who have contact with residents of continuing care or long-term care facilities or residences, those who provide home care for people at high risk, and students of related health care services. For the purposes of this statement, HCWs include any person, paid or unpaid, who provides services, works, volunteers, or trains in a health care setting\n【214】 - Influenza immunization provides benefits to HCWs and to the patients for whom they care. NACI considers the receipt of influenza vaccination to be an essential component of the standard of care for all HCWs for the protection of their patients\n【215】 - Transmission of influenza between infected HCWs and their vulnerable patients results in significant morbidity and mortality. For example, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in geriatric long-term care settings have demonstrated that vaccination of HCWs is associated with substantial decreases in morbidity  and all-cause mortality  in the residents. Therefore, HCWs should consider annual influenza vaccination included in their responsibility to provide the highest standard of care. In the absence of contraindications, refusal of HCWs to be vaccinated against influenza implies failure in their duty of care to patients\n【216】 - As noted in PHAC's Guidance: Infection Prevention and Control Measures for Healthcare Workers in Acute Care and Long-term Care Settings for seasonal influenza, all health care organizations should have a written plan for managing an influenza outbreak in their facilities. Inherent in such plans should be policies and programs to optimize HCW's influenza immunization  . As part of outbreak management, the above-mentioned PHAC guidance suggests consideration of chemoprophylaxis for all unvaccinated HCWs, unless contraindications exist. Refer to the Association of Medical Microbiology and Infectious Disease Canada (AMMI Canada) website for guidelines regarding the use of antiviral medications for prophylaxis\n【217】 # Contacts of individuals at high risk of influenza complications\n【218】 - Vaccination is recommended for contacts, both adults and children, of individuals at high risk of influenza-related complications or hospitalization , whether or not the individual at high risk has been vaccinated. These contacts include: household contacts and care providers of individuals at high risk; household contacts and care providers of infants less than 6 months of age, as these infants are at high risk of complications from influenza but cannot receive influenza vaccine; members of a household expecting a newborn during the influenza season; household contacts and care providers (whether in or out of the home) of children 6-59 months of age, and providers of services within closed or relatively closed settings to people at high risk (e.g., crew on a ship)\n【219】 # III.3 Others People who provide essential community services\n【220】 - Vaccination for these individuals should be encouraged to minimize the disruption of services and routine activities during annual influenza epidemics. People who provide essential community services, including healthy working adults, should consider annual influenza vaccination, as this intervention has been shown to decrease work absenteeism due to respiratory and related illnesses\n【221】 - People in direct contact with poultry infected with avian influenza during culling operations\n【222】 # Poultry workers\n【223】 - Although seasonal influenza vaccination will not prevent avian influenza infection, some countries  and provinces have recommended influenza vaccination on a yearly basis for poultry workers, based on the rationale that preventing infection with human influenza strains may reduce the theoretical potential for human-avian reassortment of genes, should such workers become co-infected with human and avian influenza viruses\n【224】 - Therefore, NACI recommends seasonal influenza vaccination for people in direct contact with poultry infected with avian influenza during culling operations, as these individuals may be at increased risk of avian influenza infection because of exposure during the culling operation  . Refer to the Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccine for 2013-2014 for further information informing this recommendation. Direct contact may be defined as sufficient contact with infected poultry to allow transmission of an avian virus to the exposed person. The relevant individuals include those performing the cull, as well as others who may be directly exposed to the avian virus, such as supervising veterinarians and inspectors. It is recommended that biosecurity measures such as personal protective equipment and antivirals be used. Refer to Human Health Issues Related to Avian Influenza in Canada for PHAC recommendations on the management of domestic avian influenza outbreaks\n【225】 # Swine workers\n【226】 - NACI has concluded that there is insufficient evidence at this time to recommend routine influenza vaccination specifically for swine workers; however, NACI recommends that influenza vaccination should be offered to anyone 6 months of age and older who do not have contraindications to the vaccine\n【227】 - Refer to the Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccine for 2013-2014 for further information informing this recommendation\n【228】 # IV. VACCINE PREPARATIONS AVAILABLE FOR USE IN CANADA: ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n【229】 - The following sections describe information on the efficacy and effectiveness, immunogenicity, and safety of influenza vaccine by type in two categories: IIV and LAIV. Refer to A for a summary of the characteristics of specific influenza vaccine products available in Canada for the 2019-2020 season\n【230】 - NACI acknowledges that evidence related to influenza vaccine performance, particularly with respect to vaccine efficacy and effectiveness, is constantly evolving with advances in research methodology and accumulation of data over many influenza seasons. Therefore, the evidence summarized in this section may not include the latest studies. However, in accordance with usual practice, NACI continues to monitor closely the emerging evidence on the efficacy and effectiveness, immunogenicity, and safety of influenza vaccines to update and to make recommendations when warranted\n【231】 # IV.1 Inactivated Influenza vaccine (IIV)\n【232】 - IIVs contain standardized amounts of the HA protein from representative seed strains of the two human influenza A subtypes (H3N2 and H1N1) and either one (for trivalent vaccines) or both (for quadrivalent vaccines) of the two influenza B lineages (Yamagata or Victoria). IIVs currently authorized for use in Canada are a mix of split virus and subunit vaccines, both consisting of disrupted virus particles. Split virus vaccines contain whole inactivated viruses split with detergent, ether, or both, while subunit vaccines are made of purified HA and NA. The amount of NA in the vaccines is not standardized. HA-based serum antibody produced to one influenza A subtype is anticipated to provide little or no protection against strains belonging to the other subtype. The potential for trivalent vaccine to stimulate antibody protection across B lineages requires further evaluation and may be dependent upon factors such as age and prior antigenic experience with the two B lineages\n【233】 - Because of potential changes in the circulating influenza virus from year to year and waning immunity in vaccine recipients, annual influenza vaccination is recommended. Although NACI is aware of some recent studies that suggest that vaccine induced protection may be greater in individuals who have no recent vaccine history, optimal protection against influenza, season after season, is best achieved through annual influenza vaccination  . NACI will continue to monitor this issue\n【234】 # Immunological considerations related to children\n【235】 - Young children have a high burden of illness and their vaccine-induced immune response is not as robust as older children. However, some studies suggest moderate improvement in antibody response in young children, without an increase in reactogenicity, with the use of a full vaccine dose (0.5 mL) for IIV-SDs  . On the basis of this moderate improvement in antibody response without an increase in reactogenicity, NACI recommends the use of a 0.5 mL dose for all recipients of IIV-SDs, including young children, which is thought to mitigate the reduced immune response observed in the studies with the 0.25 mL dose of IIV-SDs\n【236】 # Immunological considerations related to older adults and those with immune compromising conditions\n【237】 - Although the initial antibody response in older adults may be lower to some influenza vaccine components when compared to those in other age groups, a literature review identified no evidence for a subsequent antibody decline that was any more rapid in older adults than in younger age groups\n【238】 - Influenza vaccination can induce protective antibody levels in a substantial proportion of adults and children with immune compromising conditions, including transplant recipients, those with proliferative diseases of the hematopoietic and lymphatic systems, and HIV-infected patients\n【239】 - Most studies have shown that administration of a second dose of influenza vaccine in the same season to older adults or other individuals who may have an altered immune response does not result in a clinically significant antibody boost\n【240】 # Standard-dosetrivalentinactivatedinfluenzavaccine( IIV3-SD)\n【241】 - Vaccines currently available for use:\n【242】 - Agriflu  (Seqirus) - Fluviral  (GlaxoSmithKline) - Influvac  (BGP Pharma ULC, operating as Mylan EPD)\n【243】 # Efficacy and effectiveness\n【244】 - The NACI Literature Review on Influenza Vaccination in Healthy 5-18-Year-olds found that VE of IIV3-SD against laboratory-confirmed influenza was variable but was most frequently between 65-85%  . In the NACI literature review on Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness, Immunogenicity, and Safety in Healthy Adults 19-64 Years Old, efficacy against laboratoryconfirmed influenza for IIV3-SD in healthy adults 18-64 years of age ranged widely from as low as 15% to as high as 75%, with the majority of studies estimating efficacy at 50-60%. Refer to the Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccine for 2018-2019 for a more detailed summary of efficacy and effectiveness evidence for IIV3-SD in healthy children 5-18 years of age and healthy adults 19-64 years of age\n【245】 - In older adults, VE of IIV3-SD is about half of that in healthy adults and varies depending on the outcome measures and the study population , or B virus specifically\n【246】 - In observational studies, influenza vaccination has been shown to reduce the number of physician visits, hospitalizations, and deaths in adults 18-64 years of age with high-risk medical conditions  , hospitalizations for cardiac disease and stroke in adults 65 years of age and older  , and hospitalization and deaths in adults 18 years of age and older with diabetes mellitus  during influenza epidemics. Observational studies that use non-specific clinical outcomes or that do not take into account differences in functional status or health-related behaviours should be interpreted with caution\n【247】 # Immunogenicity\n【248】 - Both humoral and cell-mediated responses are thought to play a role in immunity to influenza. While humoral immunity is thought to play a primary role in protection against infection, cellmediated immunity, notably cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses to internal viral components, is increasingly invoked as important in protecting against severe outcomes of influenza, particularly those associated with subtype HA variations (shift and drift)  . The IM administration of IIV3-SD results in the production of circulating immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to the viral HA and NA proteins, as well as a more limited cytotoxic T lymphocyte response\n【249】 # Safety\n【250】 - Studies evaluating the safety of IIV3-SDs in healthy children have found a good safety profile with no serious adverse events of note  . The most common solicited local reactions are pain and redness at the injection site, while the most common solicited systemic reactions are irritability, malaise, and headache. Mild injection site reactions, primarily soreness at the vaccination site, have been found to occur in 7% or less of healthy children who are less than 3 years of age  . Post-vaccination fever may be observed in 12% or less of vaccinated children 1-5 years of age\n【251】 - For adults, IIV3-SDs have been demonstrated to have a good safety profile with accepreactogenicity  . Common local reactions at injection site include redness, swelling, pain, and induration. These reactions last 2-3 days and rarely interfere with normal activities. Common systemic reactions include headache, malaise, myalgia, fatigue, arthralgia, and fever\n【252】 # Adjuvantedtrivalentinactivatedinfluenzavaccine( IIV3-Adj)\n【253】 - Vaccines currently available for use:\n【254】 - Fluad  (Seqirus) - Fluad Pediatric  (Seqirus)\n【255】 # Fluad (adults 65 years of age and older) Efficacy and effectiveness\n【256】 - There is fair evidence that the MF59-adjuvanted Fluad (IIV3-Adj) may be effective at reducing the risk of hospitalization for influenza and influenza complications in older adults compared to unvaccinated individuals. However, there is insufficient evidence that IIV3-Adj is more effective at reducing the risk of hospitalization for influenza and influenza complications in older adults compared to those who received unadjuvanted subunit IIV3-SD. There remain no efficacy or effectiveness studies that compare IIV3-Adj with IIV3-HD or IIV4-SD. Refer to the NACI Literature Review Update on the Efficacy and Effectiveness of High-Dose and MF59-Adjuvanted Trivalent Inactivated Influenza Vaccines in Adults 65 Years of Age and Older for more information on the efficacy and effectiveness of IIV3-Adj in adults 65 years of age and older\n【257】 # Immunogenicity\n【258】 - The mechanism of action of MF59 is not fully determined and has primarily been studied using in vitro and mouse models. From these studies, it appears that MF59 may act differently from aluminum-based adjuvants. These studies show that MF59 acts in the muscle fibres to create a local immune-stimulatory environment at the injection site  . MF59 allows for an increased influx of phagocytes (e.g., macrophages, monocytes) to the site of injection. The recruited phagocytes are further stimulated by MF59, thereby increasing the production of chemokines to attract more innate immune cells and inducing differentiation of monocytes into dendritic cells\n【259】 - There is evidence from RCTs that IIV3-Adj elicits non-inferior immune responses compared to the unadjuvanted subunit and split virus IIV3-SDs; however, superiority of IIV3-Adj to these vaccines by pre-defined criteria has not been consistently demonstrated. Refer to the Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccine for 2018-2019 for more information on the immunogenicity of IIV3-Adj in adults 65 years of age and older\n【260】 # Safety\n【261】 - IIV3-Adj produces injection site reactions (pain, erythema, and induration) significantly more frequently than IIV3-SD, but they are classified as mild and transient. Systemic reactions (myalgia, headache, fatigue, and malaise) are comparable or more frequent with IIV3-Adj compared to IIV3-SD and are rated as mild to moderate and transient. Serious adverse events were uncommon and were comparable to IIV3-SD. Refer to the Recommendations on the use of MF59-Adjuvanted Trivalent Influenza Vaccine (Fluad  ): Supplemental Statement of Seasonal Influenza Vaccine for 2011-2012 for additional information on the safety of IIV3-Adj in adults 65 years of age and older\n【262】 # Fluad Pediatric(children6-23monthsofage) Efficacyandeffectiveness\n【263】 - A pre-licensure efficacy trial in children 6-71 months of age found a higher relative efficacy for IIV-Adj than the unadjuvanted IIV3-SD  . However, the findings of this study should be interpreted with caution. The comparator unadjuvanted IIV3 used in this trial was shown, in an unrelated study, to induce a lower immune response compared to another unadjuvanted IIV3-SD. There were concerns raised by a European Medicines Agency inspection about the quality of diagnostic laboratory testing and validity of ascertainment of influenza cases. The study administered 0.25 mL doses of the comparator unadjuvanted IIV3-SD for children less than 36 months of age, which is lower than the dose of 0.5 mL of unadjuvanted IIV3-SD or IIV4-SD that is recommended for this age group in Canada. Refer to the NACI Literature Review on Pediatric Fluad  Influenza Vaccine Use in Children 6-72 Months of Age for more information on the efficacy and effectiveness of IIV3-Adj in children\n【264】 # Immunogenicity\n【265】 - In children, there is limited but consistent evidence that IIV3-Adj is more immunogenic than IIV3-SD against both influenza A and B  . In particular, a single dose of IIV3-Adj is more immunogenic than a single dose of IIV3-SD, and has been shown in one study to produce greater GMTs than 2 doses of IIV3-SD against influenza A  . However, similar to IIV3-SD, IIV3-Adj generally induced a weaker hemagglutination-inhibition antibody response against B strains compared to A strains and therefore 2 doses of IIV3-Adj are still necessary to achieve a satisfactory immune response against influenza B. Almost all of the pre-licensure pediatric studies used vaccine formulations of 0.25 mL in children 6-35 months of age, both for IIV3-Adj and the comparator unadjuvanted influenza vaccine (NACI recommends 0.5 mL dosage of IIV3-SD or IIV4-SD for all age groups). There is limited immunogenicity evidence comparing IIV3-Adj at 0.25 mL dose to IIV3-SD or IIV4-SD at 0.5 mL dose in the 6-23 month age group. Refer to the NACI Literature Review on Pediatric Fluad  Influenza Vaccine Use in Children 6-72 Months of Age for more information on the immunogenicity of IIV3-Adj in children\n【266】 # Safety\n【267】 - The safety data in children are consistent with what is known about IIV3-Adj's safety profile in adults. In pediatric trials, IIV3-Adj was more reactogenic than IIV3-SD, with recipients experiencing 10-15% more solicited local and systemic reactions. However, most reactions were mild and resolved quickly. A dose-ranging study of MF59-adjuvanted and unadjuvanted IIV3 and IIV4 did not find an increased risk of adverse events associated with increased MF59 dose, antigen dose, or the addition of a second B strain; however, the reactogenicity of 15 µg formulations were slightly higher for both adjuvanted and unadjuvanted vaccines compared to the corresponding 7.5 µg formulations\n【268】 - There are currently no data on the effects of long-term or repeated administration of adjuvanted influenza vaccines in children. The most significant experience with an adjuvanted influenza vaccine in children was the AS03-adjuvanted A(H1N1) pandemic vaccine that has been associated with an increased risk of narcolepsy. A study comparing two AS03-adjuvanted A(H1N1) vaccine products (Pandemrix and Arepanrix) has suggested that the underlying immune mediated mechanism may not be initiated by the adjuvant, but by another component of the vaccine, specifically the A(H1N1) viral antigen  . However, the pandemic vaccine was a single strain adjuvanted vaccine administered only during one season, and it is unknown what effects a multi-strain adjuvanted vaccine or an adjuvanted vaccine administered for more than one season may have in young children\n【269】 - Refer to the NACI Literature Review on Pediatric Fluad  Influenza Vaccine Use in Children 6-72 Months of Age for additional information on the safety of IIV3-Adj in children\n【270】 # High-dosetrivalentinactivatedinfluenzavaccine( IIV3-HD)\n【271】 - Vaccine currently available for use:\n【272】 - Fluzone  High-Dose (Sanofi Pasteur)\n【273】 # Efficacy and effectiveness\n【274】 - There is good evidence that Fluzone High-Dose (IIV3-HD) provides superior protection compared with IIV3-SD in adults 65 years of age and older. A few studies found that IIV3-HD may provide greater benefit in the very elderly (e.g., 75 years of age and older) compared to younger elderly (e.g., 65-74 years of age)  ; however, additional studies are needed to validate this finding. There remain no efficacy or effectiveness studies that compare IIV3-HD with IIV3-Adj or IIV4-SD\n【275】 # Immunogenicity\n【276】 - Five studies compared the rates of seroconversion for study participants receiving IIV3-HD and IIV3-SD among those 65 years of age and older  . Rates of seroconversion were found to be about 19% higher (ranging from 8-39%) for those receiving the higher dose vaccine across all three vaccine strains. Similarly, rates of seroconversion were higher for those receiving the high-compared to standard-dose vaccines for participants 75 years of age and older and for a cohort of participants with underlying cardiopulmonary disease\n【277】 - Eight studies reported higher rates of seroprotection for older adults receiving IIV3-HD compared to those vaccinated with IIV3-SD  . Seroprotection was significantly higher for all 3 strains in the vaccine in three of five studies assessing significance. There were different results in the remaining studies. In the study by Couch et al., seroprotection was higher only against A(H1N1), possibly attributed to the fact that 78% of participants were vaccinated against the same influenza strains within 6 months prior to the study  . In Nace et al., seroprotection was higher against A(H3N2) and B but not A(H1N1); this finding may be attributed to strain circulation during the study that made it difficult to assess seroprotection against this subtype  . Geometric mean titre ratios (GMTR) of participants' responses to high-versus standard-dose influenza vaccines were reported in several studies and were calculated for those that provided group-specific, post-vaccination titres for each of the vaccines 134,135 . Seroresponse to the B strains in the vaccines was about 1.5 times greater (1.3-1.7) in the IIV3-HD recipients than the IIV3-SD recipients. The GMTR of the A strains was about 1.8 times higher for those receiving IIV3-HD compared to IIV3-SD, ranging from 1.6-2.3\n【278】 # Safety\n【279】 - IIV3-HD has been observed to produce a higher rate of some systemic reactions than IIV3-SD. Studies have reported higher rates of malaise, myalgia, and moderate to severe fever. Most systemic reactions were mild and resolved within 3 days. Serious adverse events were rare and similar in frequency between standard-dose and high-dose vaccines. Refer to NACI's A Review of the Literature of High Dose Seasonal Influenza Vaccine for Adults 65 Years and Older for details\n【280】 # Standard-dosequadrivalentinactivatedinfluenzavaccine( IIV4-SD)\n【281】 - Vaccines currently available for use:\n【282】 - Afluria  Tetra (Seqirus) - Flulaval  Tetra (GlaxoSmithKline) - Fluzone  Quadrivalent (Sanofi Pasteur)\n【283】 # Efficacy and effectiveness\n【284】 - In the NACI Literature Review on Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccines, only one study was identified that measured IIV4-SD efficacy. In that study, efficacy was estimated at 59% in children 3-8 years of age, in comparison to children who received hepatitis A vaccine  . No literature was found in this review on efficacy or effectiveness directly comparing trivalent and quadrivalent formulations\n【285】 # Immunogenicity\n【286】 - In this same review of the literature, NACI reviewed the immunogenicity data for IIV4-SD produced by manufacturers who supplied influenza vaccine in Canada at the time of the literature review: AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline, and Sanofi Pasteur. The results of phase II and III trials that compared trivalent formulations to quadrivalent formulations generally showed non-inferiority of the quadrivalent products for the A(H3N2), A(H1N1), and B strain contained in the trivalent formulations. As expected, these studies showed that the immune response to the B strain that was not in the trivalent formulation was better in subjects who received the quadrivalent vaccine, which contained the additional B strain. These findings were consistent across age groups. Refer to the Literature Review on Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccines for additional details\n【287】 - In the phase III trials, recipients of the trivalent formulations showed, to a lesser degree, some immune response to the B strain not contained in the trivalent formulation. In one study of adults, both the trivalent and quadrivalent vaccines met all the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) and Centre for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) criteria for evaluation of influenza vaccine immunogenicity, including those for the B strain not in the trivalent vaccine\n【288】 - In all other studies, the trivalent vaccine failed at least one of the criteria for seroprotection or seroconversion for the missing B strain. It has been hypothesized that there is some level of cross-reactivity between B strains. The degree of cross protection against infection with one lineage provided by immunization against the other lineage is uncertain\n【289】 # Safety\n【290】 - As IIV4-SD has higher antigenic content than IIV3-SD, increased reactogenicity may be a concern for the quadrivalent vaccine. However, pre-licensure clinical trials ( Literature Review on Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccines) and post-marketing surveillance showed that IIV4-SD had a similar safety profile to IIV3-SD\n【291】 # IV.2 Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV)\n【292】 - LAIV contains standardized quantities of FFU of live attenuated influenza virus reassortants. The virus strains in LAIV are cold-adapted and temperature sensitive, so they replicate in the nasal mucosa rather than the lower respiratory tract, and they are attenuated, so they do not produce ILI. There have been no reported or documented cases, and no theoretical or scientific basis to suggest transmission of vaccine virus would occur to the individual administering LAIV. As a live replicating whole virus formulation administered intranasally, it elicits mucosal immunity, which may more closely mimic natural infection\n【293】 - Vaccine currently available for use:\n【294】 - FluMist  Quadrivalent (AstraZeneca)\n【295】 # Efficacy and effectiveness\n【296】 - After careful review of the available Canadian and international LAIV VE data over many influenza seasons, NACI concluded that the current evidence is consistent with LAIV's providing comparable protection against influenza to that afforded by IIV and does not support a recommendation for the preferential use of LAIV in children 2-17 years of age\n【297】 - Observational studies from the United States of America found low effectiveness of LAIV against circulating post-2009 pandemic A(H1N1), or A(H1N1)pdm09, in 2013-2014 and 2015-2016; however, reduced LAIV effectiveness was not observed in Canada or any other countries that have investigated the issue\n【298】 - Manufacturer investigation identified potential reduced replicative fitness of the A(H1N1)pdm09like LAIV viruses in the nasal mucosa from the two affected A(H1N1)-dominant seasons compared to pre-2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) LAIV viruses as contributing to the poor LAIV effectiveness against circulating A(H1N1)  . This finding led to the manufacturer replacing the A(H1N1)pdm09 component of LAIV with a new strain. In adults, studies have found IIV-SD to be similarly or more efficacious or effective compared with LAIV\n【299】 - Refer to the Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccine for 2018-2019 for detailed information supporting this recommendation\n【300】 # Immunogenicity\n【301】 - LAIV, which is administered by the intranasal route, is thought to result in an immune response that mimics that induced by natural infection with wild-type viruses, with the development of both mucosal and systemic immunity. Local mucosal antibodies protect the upper respiratory tract and may be more important for protection than serum antibody\n【302】 - LAIV4 has shown non-inferiority based on immunogenicity compared to LAIV3 in both children and adults. The immune response to the B strain found only in the quadrivalent formulation was better in children who received the quadrivalent vaccine\n【303】 # Safety\n【304】 - The most common adverse events experienced by recipients of LAIV3 are nasal congestion and runny nose, which are also reported for LAIV4. In a large efficacy trial, rates of wheezing were statistically higher among children 6-23 months of age for LAIV3 compared to IIV3-SD  . This finding is expected to be the same for recipients of LAIV4; however, pre-licensure clinical studies for LAIV4 were conducted in adults and children 2 years of age and older\n【305】 - Studies on LAIV3 have shown that vaccine virus can be recovered by nasal swab in children and adults following immunization (i.e., \"shedding\"). The frequency of shedding decreases with increasing age and time since vaccination. Shedding is generally below the levels needed to transmit infection, although in rare instances, shed vaccine viruses can be transmitted from vaccine recipients to unvaccinated people. Refer to the NACI Recommendations on the Use of Live, Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (FluMist  ): Supplemental Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccine for 2011-2012 for more information on LAIV and viral shedding\n【306】 # IV.3 Schedule\n【307】 - The first time that children 6 months to less than 9 years of age receive seasonal influenza immunization, a two-dose schedule is required to achieve protection  . Several studies have looked at whether these two initial doses need to be given in the same season\n【308】 - Because children 6-23 months of age are less likely to have had prior priming exposure to an influenza virus, special effort is warranted to ensure that a two-dose schedule is followed for previously unvaccinated children in this age group\n【309】 # IV.4 Simultaneous Administration with Other Vaccines\n【310】 - In general, NACI recommends that two live parenteral vaccines be administered either on the same day or at least 4 weeks apart  . This recommendation is based largely on a single study from 1965 that demonstrated immune interference between smallpox vaccine and measles vaccine administered 9-15 days apart. Subsequent studies have revealed conflicting results on immune interference between live vaccines\n【311】 - No studies were found on potential immune interference between LAIV and other live attenuated vaccines (oral or parenteral) administered within 4 weeks. A few studies on concomitant administration of LAIV3 with MMR, varicella, and oral polio vaccines did not find evidence of clinically significant immune interference  . One study reported a statistically significant but not clinically meaningful decrease in seroresponse rates to rubella antigen when administered concomitantly with LAIV\n【312】 - In theory, the administration of two live vaccines sequentially within less than 4 weeks could reduce the efficacy of the second vaccine. Possible immune mechanisms include: the inhibitory and immunomodulatory effects of systemic and locally produced cytokines on B-and T-cell response and viral replication; immunosuppression induced by certain viruses (such as measles); and direct viral interference as a result of competition for a common niche. Mucosal vaccines may have less impact on a parenteral vaccine and vice versa. The immune response with a mucosal vaccine may be compartmentalized to the mucosa while that to a parenteral vaccine is systemic. It is likely that there is some interaction between the systemic and mucosal compartments; however, the extent to which this interaction occurs is not known\n【313】 - Given the lack of data for immune interference, based on expert opinion, NACI recommends that LAIV can be given together with or at any time before or after the administration of any other live attenuated or inactivated vaccine. NACI recognizes that some vaccine providers may choose to give LAIV and other live vaccines simultaneously or separated by at least 4 weeks as a professional preference. Alternatively, an inactivated influenza vaccine may be given\n【314】 # IV.5 Additional Vaccine Safety Considerations\n【315】 - Influenza vaccine is safe and well tolerated. Contraindications, precautions, and common adverse events are described in II. Additional information regarding egg-allergic individuals and GBS is provided below\n【316】 # Egg-allergic individuals\n【317】 - After careful review of clinical and post-licensure safety data, NACI has concluded that eggallergic individuals may be vaccinated against influenza using any appropriate product, including LAIV, without prior influenza vaccine skin test and with the full dose, irrespective of a past severe reaction to egg and without any particular consideration, including vaccination setting. The amount of trace ovalbumin allowed in influenza vaccines that are authorized for use in Canada is associated with a low risk of adverse events. The observation period post-vaccination is as recommended in Vaccine Safety in Part 2 of the CIG. As with all vaccine administration, vaccine providers should be prepared with the necessary equipment, knowledge, and skills to respond to a vaccine emergency at all times\n【318】 - Refer to the Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccine for 2018-2019 for safety data supporting this recommendation for IIV and LAIV\n【319】 # Guillain-Barré syndrome\n【320】 - In a review of studies conducted between 1976 and 2005, the United States Institute of Medicine concluded that the 1976 \"swine flu\" vaccine was associated with an elevated risk of GBS. However, evidence was inadequate to accept or to reject a causal relation between GBS in adults and seasonal influenza vaccination\n【321】 - The attriburisk of GBS in the period following seasonal and monovalent 2009 pandemic influenza vaccination is about one excess case per million vaccinations\n【322】 - This finding shows that both influenza vaccination and influenza illness are associated with small attriburisks of GBS, but the risk of GBS associated with influenza illness is notably higher than with influenza vaccination. The self-controlled study also found that the risk of GBS after vaccination was highest during weeks 2-4, whereas for influenza illness, the risk was greatest within the first week after a health care encounter and decreased thereafter, but remained significantly elevated for up to 4 weeks. The risk of GBS associated with influenza vaccination must be balanced against the risk of GBS associated with influenza infection itself and all the other benefits of influenza vaccination\n【323】 # V. CHOICE OF SEASONAL INFLUENZA VACCINE: ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n【324】 - With the recent availability of a number of new influenza vaccines, some of which are designed to enhance immunogenicity in specific age groups, the choice of product is now more complex. II.5 summarizes NACI's recommendations on the choice of currently available influenza vaccines. This section provides more details for these recommendations\n【325】 # V.1 Children\n【326】 # Burden of disease in children\n【327】 - The proportion of disease burden due to influenza B infection is higher in children compared to other age groups. Canadian surveillance data from 2001-2002 to 2012-2013 has shown that influenza B strains accounted for 17% of laboratory-confirmed tests for influenza. Children less than 24 months of age comprise approximately 2% of the Canadian population\n【328】 - The IMPACT study also found that the proportion of deaths attributo influenza was significantly greater for influenza B ,1 Given the burden of influenza B disease in children and the potential for lineage mismatch between the predominant circulating strain of influenza B and the strain in a trivalent vaccine, NACI recommends that a quadrivalent influenza vaccine should be used. If a quadrivalent vaccine is not available, any of the available trivalent vaccines should be used\n【329】 - There is insufficient evidence to make comparative recommendations on the use of IIV3-Adj over IIV3-SD\n【330】 - Children 2-17 years of age Three types of influenza vaccine are available for use in children 2-17 years of age: IIV3-SD, IIV4-SD, and LAIV4\n【331】 - Given the burden of influenza B disease in children and the potential for lineage mismatch between the predominant circulating strain of influenza B and the strain in a trivalent vaccine, NACI recommends that either IIV4-SD or LAIV4 should be used in children without contraindications. If IIV4-SD or LAIV4 is not available, IIV3-SD should be used\n【332】 - The current evidence does not support a recommendation for the preferential use of LAIV in children and adolescents 2-17 years of age. Refer to the NACI Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccine for 2018-2019 for information supporting this recommendation\n【333】 # Children 2-17 years of age with chronic health conditions\n【334】 - NACI recommends that any age-appropriate influenza vaccine (IIV or LAIV) may be considered for children 2-17 years of age with chronic health conditions, with the exception of those with severe asthma (as defined as currently on oral or high-dose inhaled glucocorticosteroids), those with medically attended wheezing in the 7 days prior to vaccination, and those with immune compromising conditions, all of whom should receive IIV. If IIV is used, NACI recommends that a quadrivalent vaccine should be used. If a quadrivalent vaccine is not available, a trivalent vaccine should be used. NACI recommends that LAIV may be given to children with s, non-severe asthma and children with cystic fibrosis who are not treated with immunosuppressive drugs, such as prolonged systemic corticosteroids\n【335】 - Refer to the NACI Recommendations on the Use of Live, Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (FluMist  ): Supplemental Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccine for 2011-2012 for additional information supporting these recommendations\n【336】 # Summary of vaccine characteristics for decision making\n【337】 - IIV (IIV3-SD and IIV4-SD) and LAIV (LAIV4) are authorized for use in Canada for children 2-17 years of age. The comparison of the vaccine characteristics of IIV and LAIV, in  below, may be considered in making a decision on the preferred vaccine option(s) for use by an individual or a public health program\n【338】 # Efficacy and effectiveness\n【339】 - There was early evidence of superior efficacy of LAIV3 compared with IIV3-SD in children less than 6 years of age from RCTs, with weaker evidence of superior efficacy in older children. However, later postmarketing and surveillance studies across multiple influenza seasons found comparable protection against influenza for LAIV and IIV, with findings of reduced effectiveness against A(H1N1) in some studies\n【340】 - Like IIV4-SD, LAIV4 is expected to provide additional protection against the influenza B strain not contained in IIV3-SD\n【341】 # Immunogenicity\n【342】 - LAIV3 has been shown to be as immunogenic as IIV3-SD, depending on age, with LAIV4 being non-inferior to LAIV3\n【343】 # Safety\n【344】 - Rhinitis (runny nose) and nasal congestion are more common with LAIV. Clinical studies and post-marketing studies showed a similar safety profile to IIV\n【345】 - Contraindications There are vaccine contraindications specific to LAIV. LAIV is contraindicated for children with severe asthma, medically attended wheezing in the 7 days prior to vaccination, and immune compromising conditions, as well as those currently receiving aspirin or aspirincontaining therapy\n【346】 # Administration\n【347】 - Delivery of LAIV as a nasal spray may be preferable for children who are averse to receiving the vaccine by needle injection\n【348】 - Abbreviations: IIV3-SD: standard-dose trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine; IIV4-SD: standard-dose quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine; LAIV3: trivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine; LAIV4: quadrivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine\n【349】 # V.2 Adults\n【350】 # Burden of disease in adults\n【351】 - A study focusing on estimates of deaths associated with influenza in the United States of America has established that the average annual rate of influenza-associated deaths for adults aged 65 years of age and older was 17.0 deaths per 100,000 (range: 2.4-36.7)  . The study also states that deaths among persons 65 years of age and older accounted for 87.9% of the overall estimated average annual influenza-associated deaths with underlying pneumonia and influenza causes\n【352】 - When influenza-related deaths were estimated using underlying respiratory and circulatory causes, these estimates increased to 66.1 deaths per 100,000 (range: 8.0-121.1) and 89.4%, respectively. This study described a wide variation in the estimated number of deaths from season to season, which was closely related to the particular influenza virus types and subtypes in circulation\n【353】 - Estimates presented in the study of yearly influenza-associated deaths with underlying pneumonia and influenza causes  reveal a large difference between influenza type A and B with a calculated median of greater than 6,000 deaths associated with influenza type A and half of that number for influenza type B (approximately 3,360) for persons 65 years of age and older\n【354】 - During the 22 seasons in which influenza A(H3N2) was the prominent strain, the average influenza-associated mortality rates were 2.7 times higher than for the nine seasons that it was not (all age groups combined), and on average, there were about 37% more annual influenzaassociated deaths, regardless of the underlying medical cause. A higher risk of hospitalization and death was also reported by Cromer et al. in adults 65 years of age and older, compared to younger adults in their assessment of the burden of influenza in England by age and clinical risk group\n【355】 - Canadian surveillance data show that hospitalization rates among adults 65 years of age and older were higher during the 2014-2015 season compared to the previous five influenza seasons and also compared to the 2012-2013 season when A(H3N2) also predominated; 2014-2015 was a season in which A(H3N2) circulation predominated and in which there was a vaccine mismatch with the circulating A(H3N2) strain\n【356】 - Similar to the hospitalization rates, death rates among seniors were highest in the 2014-2015 season compared to the previous five seasons and compared to the previous A(H3N2) season in 2012-2013. Death rates among other age groups were similar to or lower than the previous five influenza seasons. Laboratory detections over this same time period showed that influenza seasons in which influenza subtype A(H3N2) predominated, disproportionally affected adults 65 years of age and older, while seasons with greater A(H1N1) detections resulted in a higher prevalence of positive cases in younger age groups. NACI recommends that any of the available influenza vaccines should be used\n【357】 # Adults 65 years of age and older\n【358】 - Four types of influenza vaccine are available for use in adults 65 years of age and older: IIV3-SD, IIV3-Adj, IIV3-HD, and IIV4-SD\n【359】 # Recommendation for individual-level decision making\n【360】 - NACI concludes that, given the burden of disease associated with influenza A(H3N2) and the good evidence of better efficacy compared to IIV3-SD in this age group, when available, IIV3-HD should be used over IIV3-SD\n【361】 - There is insufficient evidence to make comparative recommendations on the use of IIV3-Adj or IIV4-SD over IIV3-SD or among IIV3-Adj, IIV3-HD, and IIV4-SD\n【362】 # Recommendation for public health program-level decision making\n【363】 - NACI recommends that any of the available influenza vaccines should be used\n and without data on the relative efficacy and effectiveness between IIV3-HD, IIV3-Adj, and IIV4-SD, there is insufficient evidence to make a comparative recommendation on the use of these vaccines at the programmatic level\n【365】 # Summary of vaccine characteristics for decision making\n【366】 - There are four types of inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV3-SD, IIV3-Adj, IIV3-HD, and IIV4-SD) authorized for use in Canada for adults 65 years of age and older. The comparison of vaccine characteristics across vaccine types, in  below, may be considered in making a decision on the preferred vaccine option(s) for use by an individual or a public health program. Due to a lack of available data directly comparing the performance of IIV3-Adj, IIV3-HD, and IIV4-SD, considerations for these vaccines in  are compared to IIV3-SD for which comparative data on efficacy, effectiveness, and/or immunogenicity with each of IIV3-Adj, IIV3-HD, and IIV4-SD are available. Higher rate of some systemic reactions than IIV3-SD; most systemic reactions were mild and transient\n【367】 - Serious adverse events were rare and similar in frequency to IIV3-SD\n【368】 - Pre-licensure clinical trials and postmarketing surveillance showed a similar safety profile to IIV3\n【369】 - Abbreviations: IIV3-Adj: adjuvanted trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine; IIV3-HD: high-dose trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine; IIV3-SD: standard-dose trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine; IIV4-SD: standard-dose quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine\n【370】 - NACI has not assessed the comparative cost-effectiveness of available influenza vaccine types for adults 65 years of age and older.  The burden of influenza A(H3N2) disease is higher in adults 65 years of age and older compared to younger age groups. * Influenza vaccines are contraindicated in people who have had an anaphylactic reaction to any of the vaccine components, with the exception of egg. Please note that not all vaccines listed contain the same components\n【371】 - Adults with chronic health conditions NACI recommends that any age-appropriate IIV, but not LAIV, should be offered to adults with chronic health conditions identified in List 1, including those with immune compromising conditions\n【372】 - Pregnant women NACI recommends that any age-appropriate IIV, but not LAIV, should be offered to pregnant women\n【373】 - Due to a lack of safety data at this time, LAIV should not be administered to pregnant women due to the theoretical risk to the fetus from administering a live virus vaccine. LAIV can be administered to breastfeeding women\n【374】 - Health care workers NACI recommends that any age-appropriate IIV, but not LAIV, should be offered to HCWs\n【375】 - Comparative studies in healthy adults have found IIV to be similarly or more efficacious or effective compared with LAIV  . In addition, as a precautionary measure, LAIV recipients should avoid close association with people with severe immune compromising conditions (e.g., bone marrow transplant recipients requiring isolation) for at least 2 weeks following vaccination, because of the theoretical risk for transmitting a vaccine virus and causing infection.

There are three types of parapneumonic effusions: uncomplicated effusions, complicated effusions, and empyema.  Uncomplicated effusions generally respond well to appropriate antibiotic treatment.  Complicated parapneumonic effusions respond more variably: many resolve with antibiotics but may benefit from early pleural fluid drainage.  Treatment of empyemas includes antibiotics, complete pleural fluid drainage, and reexpansion of the lung\n【3】 - A parapneumonic effusion is any pleural effusion that is associated with a bacterial pneumonia, lung abscess or bronchiectasis.  40% of all patients with bacterial pneumonia develop a pleural effusion, and the development of a pleural effusion increases morbidity and mortality as compared with an isolated pneumonia,  In general parapneumonic effusions have 3 stages:\n【4】 - Exudative: Due to capillary leak, causing a sterile effusion that has a poly predominance, with normal glucose and pH.  It is seen within the 1st 72, and will usually resolve with antibiotics alone\n【5】 - Fibrinopurulent: Occurs during days 3-7.  The pleural fluid becomes infected with bacteria, and the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) rises, as the glucose and pH fall.  As the fibroblasts get busy, loculations develop which limits the extension of the empyema\n【6】 - Organization: Further fibroblast activity produces a pleural peel leading to restrictive lung disease.  Without definitive treatment, the empyema can drain externally (empyema necessitatis) or into the lung to produce a broncho-pleural fistula\n【7】 - Approximately 20% of all parapneumonic effusions evolve into empyema.  Hippocrates described empyema thoracis around 400 BC and predicted drainage of the pleural cavity as the treatment of choice.  The term empyema refers to either the presence of gross pus in the pleural space, or a positive gram stain on pleural fluid analysis.  60% of empyemas evolve from a parapneumonic effusion, 20% after thoracic surgery and 20% from thoracic trauma, esophageal perforation, thoracentesis or subdiaphragmatic infection.

In order to be synchronous, the events must be related to one another conceptually, and the chance that they would occur together by random chance must be very small\n【2】 # The concept of synchronicity\n【3】 - The idea of synchronicity is that the conceptual relationship of minds, defined by the relationship between ideas, is intricately structured in its own logical way and gives rise to relationships which have nothing to do with causal relationships in which a cause precedes an effect. Instead, causal relationships are understood as simultaneous — that is, the cause and effect occur at the same time. Synchronous events reveal an underlying pattern, a conceptual framework which encompasses, but is larger than, any of the systems which display the synchronicity. The suggestion of a larger framework is essential in order to satisfy the definition of synchronicity as originally developed by Swiss psychologist Carl Jung\n【4】 - Carl Jung coined the word to describe what he called \"temporally coincident occurrences of acausal events.\"  Jung variously described synchronicity as an \"'acausal connecting principle'\" (i.e. a pattern of connection that cannot be explained by conventional, efficient causality), \"meaningful coincidence\" and \"acausal parallelism\". Jung introduced the concept in his 1952 paper \"Synchronicity — An Acausal Connecting Principle\", though he had been considering the concept for almost thirty years\n【5】 - It was a principle that Jung felt gave conclusive evidence for his concepts of archetypes and the collective unconscious , in that it was descriptive of a governing dynamic that underlay the whole of human experience and history — social, emotional, psychological, and spiritual\n【6】 - Jung believed that many experiences perceived as coincidence were not merely due to chance but, instead, suggested the manifestation of parallel events or circumstances reflecting this governing dynamic\n【7】 - One of Jung's favourite quotes on synchronicity was from Through the Looking-Glass by Lewis Carroll, in which the White Queen says to Alice: \"It's a poor sort of memory that only works backwards\"\n【8】 - Events that happen which appear at first to be coincidence but are later found to be causally related are termed Incoincident\n【9】 # Examples\n【10】 - A well-known example of synchronicity is the true story of the French writer Émile Deschamps who in 1805 was treated to some plum pudding by the stranger Monsieur de Fortgibu.  Ten years later, he encountered plum pudding on the menu of a Paris restaurant, and wanted to order some, but the waiter told him the last dish had already been served to another customer, who turned out to be de Fortgibu.  Many years later in 1832 Émile Deschamps was at a diner, and was once again offered plum pudding.  He recalled the earlier incident and told his friends that only de Fortgibu was missing to make the setting complete — and in the same instant the now senile de Fortgibu entered the room\n【11】 - A mother is working at preparing her dinner, and thinks \"It would be nice to have some flowers here today\", while her son is in the garden picking flowers for her dinner. The mother has never had flowers on the dinner before, and the son has never brought flowers, but their close relationship leads them to both originally create the same idea at the same time\n【12】 - Simultaneous discovery, the creation of the same new idea at causally disconnected places by two persons at approximately the same time. It is very difficult to account for simultaneous discovery by random chance. If for example an American and a British musician, having never had anything to do with one another, arrived at the same musical concept, chord sequence, feel or lyrics at the same time in different places, this is an example of synchronicity. This is explained by reasons such as global culture, which is the larger framework required to fit the definition of synchronicity\n【13】 - During production of The Wizard of Oz, a coat bought from a second-hand store for the costume of Professor Marvel was later found to have belonged to L. Frank Baum, author of the children's book upon which the film is based\n【14】 - The Wizard of Oz and Pink Floyd are part of the alleged Dark Side of the Rainbow synchronicity\n【15】 # Study\n【16】 , after conducting 28 years of research on the relationships and interactions between Mind and Matter\n【17】 # Criticism\n【18】 - According to Occam's razor, positing an underlying mechanism for meaningfully interpreted correlations is an unsupported explanation for a \"meaningful coincidence\" which may be explained by simple coincidence. Jung and followers\n【19】 - believe that Synchronous events such as simultaneous discovery happen far more often than\n【20】 - random chance would allow, even after accounting for the sampling bias inherent in the\n【21】 - fact that meaningful coincidences are noticeable while meaningless coincidences are not\n【22】 - John Constantine, the main character in the Vertigo Comics series Hellblazer, is sometimes seen \"riding the synchronicity highway,\" to meet certain goals or even just to one up those around him. This has the same effect as that described in this article, and it is one of John Constantine's more unusual tricks, and part of what makes him so dangerous. He is also seen doing this in Books of Magic, the graphic novel by Neil Gaiman\n【23】 - The phenomenon is also explored, though not named, in \"The Red Notebook\" by Paul Auster, and is considered a major theme of his entire bibliography, appearing in some form in almost every work\n【24】 - In the 1976 film The Eagle Has Landed, the character Max Radl (Robert Duvall) asks a subordinate if he is familiar with the works of Jung, and then explains the theory of Synchronicity\n【25】 - The Dirk Gently series of books by Douglas Adams often plays on the synchronicity concept.  The main character carries a \"pocket I Ching\" that also functions as a calculator, up to a point\n【26】 - The concept of ta'veren in Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time series functions similarly to synchronicity\n【27】 - In the film Repo Man Miller's famous Plate 'o' Shrimp theory is an exact representation of synchronicity\n【28】 - In a 2002 album Tenth Dimensions by metal artist Blaze, a lot of the songs  synchronicity, with some songs like \"Stealing Time\" directly using the word\n【29】 - In the film I ♥ Huckabees, a character hires existential detectives to solve his coincidence. They caution him: \"Not all coincidences are meaningful!\"\n【30】 - In Philip K Dick's The Game Players of Titan, several characters possessing pre-cognitive abilities cite the acausal principle of synchronicity as an element which hampers their ability to accurately predict certain possible futures\n【31】 - In the D20 Modern roleplaying game Urban Arcana, Synchronicity is a magic spell that subtly rearranges reality, allowing the subject to avoid the minor inconveniences and hassles of everyday life. While the spell is in effect, buses and trains run on time, stoplights and crosswalk signals change in your favor just as you approach an intersection, and the flow of street traffic and pedestrians will allow you to proceed unimpeded, without hurry or delay. Waiters and clerks will approach as soon as they are wanted, and depart when you desire privacy. Taxi cabs, elevators, vacant parking spaces, and so forth will similarly be available wherever and whenever needed. This spell is particularly helpful when the subject is chasing someone or is trying to escape pursuers\n【32】 - In the television series Strange Luck, the main character Chance Harper spends his entire life experiencing unplanned synchronicity, which he takes advantage of by becoming a freelance photographer\n【33】 - The Dalai Lama quoted: \"I am open to the guidance of synchronicity, and do not let expectations hinder my path.\"\n【34】 - Terence McKenna used the term 'Cosmic giggle' to mean  \"a randomly roving zone of synchronicity and statistical anomaly. Should you be caught up in it, it will turn reality on its head. It is objective and subjective, simultaneously 'really there' and yet somehow is sustained by imagination and expectation\\\"\n【35】 em\n【36】 ↑ Jung defined the collective\n【37】 - unconscious as akin to instincts in Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious\n【38】 ↑ In Synchronicity in the final two pages of the Conclusion, Jung stated that not all coincidences are meaningful and further explained the creative causes of this phenomenon\n【39】 'It's very good jam,' said the Queen\n【40】 'Well, I don't want any TO-DAY, at any rate.'\n【41】 'You couldn't have it if you DID want it,' the Queen said\n【42】 'The rule is, jam to-morrow and jam yesterday--but never jam\n【43】 - to-day.'\n【44】 'It MUST come sometimes to \"jam to-day,\"' Alice objected\n【45】 'No, it can't,' said the Queen.  'It's jam every OTHER day: to-day isn't any OTHER day, you know.'\n【46】 'I don't understand you,' said Alice.  'It's dreadfully confusing!'\n【47】 'That's the effect of living backwards,' the Queen said kindly: 'it always makes one a little giddy at first--'\n【48】 'Living backwards!' Alice repeated in great astonishment.  'I never heard of such a thing!'\n【49】 '--but there's one great advantage in it, that one's memory works both ways.'\n【50】 'I'm sure MINE only works one way,' Alice remarked.  'I can't remember things before they happen.'\n【51】 'It's a poor sort of memory that only works backwards,' the Queen remarked\n【52】 ↑ \"Snopes entry\"\n【53】 ↑ Article on\n【54】 It's all part of a cosmic unconsciousness\n【55】 ↑ McKenna quoted by Alex Burns\n【56】 - Carl Jung .

Von Willebrand disease (vWD) is the most common genetic coagulation disorder described in humans.  It affects up to 1% of the population, although most cases are mild. Symptomatic vWD is much rare, ~1 in 10000.  Von Willebrand disease arises from a qualitative or quantitative deficiency of von Willebrand factor (vWF), a large glycoprotein protein that is required for platelets to bind to collagen.  vWF is therefore important in primary hemostasis.  When the disease comes to medical attention, it usually presents in the typical manner for platelet disorders mucosal bleeding and easy bruising. The disease is usually inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, although there are recessive forms as well, and it can also be acquired secondary to another disease\n【3】 # Historical Perspective\n【4】 - Von Willebrand's disease was first described by Erik Adolf von Willebrand, a Finnish pediatrician in 1926. Dr. Erik Adolf von Willebrand was also the first to differentiate Von Willebrand's disease from hemophilia. Von Willebrand's disease was initially named hereditary pseudo hemophilia. In the mid 1950s it was recognized that Von Willebrand's disease was usually accompanied by decreased level of coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) activity. In the early 1970s the immunologic distinction between FVIII and von Willebrand factor was established. In the 1980s, Cloning of the VWF gene was investigated which has facilitated investigation into the genetic basis of VWD\n【5】 # Classification\n【6】 - Von Willebrand disease may be classified as acquired or inherited. There are four hereditary types of vWD described - type 1, type 2, type 3, and platelet-type. Most cases are hereditary, but acquired forms of vWD have been described. The International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis's (ISTH) classification depends on the definition of qualitative and quantitative defects in Von Willebrand factor\n【7】 # Pathophysiology\n【8】 - Von Willebrand factor is a glycoprotein present in blood and is involved in hemostasis. Its synthesis takes place in the endothelium (in the Weibel-Palade bodies), megakaryocytes (α-granules of platelets), and subendothelial connective tissue and are stored there too. The vWF monomer contains a number of specific domains which binds to factor VIII, platelet GPIb-receptor, Heparin, Collagen. Von Willebrand disease is due to an abnormality, either quantitative or qualitative, of the von Willebrand factor. Von Willebrand factor gene mutations results in problems with subunit or multimer formation, storage, secretion, proteolysis, and increased clearance. Von Willebrand's Disease can also be acquired secondary to another diseases. Acquired VWD is associated with other diseases resulting from different pathological processes. These pathological processes includes Antibody formation resulting in Impaired vWF function and Increased clearance of VWF. Other mechanisms are enhanced proteolysis and decreased synthesis of von Willebrand factor (vWF). Von Willebrand disease types 1 and 2 (except type 2N which is inherited recessively) are inherited as autosomal dominant traits and type 3 is inherited as autosomal recessive\n【9】 # Causes\n【10】 - VWD is caused by a quantitative or qualitative defect in vWF. Most cases of vWD are due to inherited mutations that affect production of vWF. There are also acquired forms of vWD where vWF is impaired due to other pathological processes. Acquired defects in vWF can be caused by a number of conditions,for example mitral valve prolapse, ventricular assist device, ventricular septal defect, aortic stenosis, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, chronic myeloid leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, wilms tumor, waldenström macroglobulinemia, essential thrombocythemia, multiple myeloma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, polycythemia vera, valproic acid, ciprofloxacin, griseofulvin, systemic lupus erythematosus,hypothyroidism, uremia, hemoglobinopathies and angiodysplasia\n【11】 # Differentiating Von Willebranddiseasefromotherdiseases\n【12】 - vWD must be differentiated from platelet disorders, thrombophilias, and hemophilias based on genetic disoder, clinical presentation, laboratory findings and treatment\n【13】 # Epidemiology and Demographics\n【14】 - The prevalence of von Willebrand’s disease is 0.6 to 1.3%. It is estimated that the referral prevalence of von Willebrand’s disease is approximately 1 case per 10,000 persons. The actual abnormality (which does not necessarily lead to disease) occurs in 0.9-3% of the population. The symptoms of VWD is disproportionately more common in women of child-bearing age. Although autosomal inheritance pattern of disease lead to an equal distribution of male patients and female patients, the disease has female predominance whose bleeding tendency shows during menstruation. There is no racial predilection to vWD however, it may be more severe or apparent in people with blood type O\n【15】 # Risk Factors\n【16】 - Common risk factors in the development of Von Willebrand disease include positive family history and consanguineous relationships. Less common risk factors in the development of Von Willebrand disease include lymphoproliferative disorders and aortic stenosis\n【17】 # Screening\n【18】 - The ISTH-Bleeding Assessment Tool is a validated instrument that is used to screen patients referred for bleeding symptoms for further laboratory testing. The three main screening tests used in the diagnosis of VWD include vonWillebrand Factor (VWF) antigen, platelet-dependent VWF activity, and factor VIII activity\n【19】 # Natural History, Complications, and Prognosis\n【20】 - Patients with VWD can become symptomatic at any age. A typical history in a patient with mild to moderate disease includes epistaxis lasting longer than 10 minutes in childhood lifelong easy bruising, bleeding following dental extractions, other invasive dental procedures, or other forms of surgery. Women with VWD usually have a history of heavy menstrual bleeding and may have bleeding during the peripartum period, often at or within hours of delivery and at 5 to 10 days after delivery. Menorrhagia is a major complication. Angiodysplasia is serious, and possibly life-threatening complication. Intraarticular bleeding may be a presenting symptom in those with type 2N or type 3 disease. For some patients, vWD is a mild bleeding disorder and can be managed easily. Patients with mild disease may experience clinically severe hemorrhage following trauma or invasive procedures. Variability of symptoms exists among family members. People with vWD types II and III face severe and potentially life threatening bleeding episodes. Type III disease patients have low FVIII levels and present with arthropathies. Levels of vWF normally increase with age in patients with type I vWD, In patients with type II vWD, vWF levels does not increase with aging\n【21】 # Diagnosis\n【22】 # Diagnostic Studyof Choice\n【23】 - There is no single diagnostic study of choice for the diagnosis of von Willebrand disease, but von Willebrand disease can be diagnosed based on screening tests followed by confirmatory tests. The screening tests for VWD that are selected by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute include testing for vWF antigen, VWF ristocetin cofactor activityand factor VIII clotting activity. When one of the VWD screening test is abnormal, further confirmatory tests are performed to establish the correct diagnosis and determine the type of VWD. Genotyping is most beneficial for type 1 patients with vWF ≤30 IU/dL and those with type 2 or 3. Genotyping also detects a benign type of vWD the D1472H, It affects ristocetin binding but not vWF function\n【24】 ## History and Symptoms\n【25】 - Patients with von Willebrand’s disease present with history of mucosal bleeding, recurrent nose bleeds, oral cavity bleeding, and positive family history of similer symptoms among other family members. Adults patients with vWD mainly present with bleeding after dental extraction/ or other surgery. Heavy menstrual periods and postpartum hemorrhage are common among affected females with von Willebrand’s disease. Severe internal or joint bleeding can occur but is usually rare\n【26】 ## Physical Examination\n【27】 - Patients with vWD commonly have negative physical examination findings however the findings may include ecchymoses, hematomas with varying sizes and location and evidence of current or recent mucosal bleeding\n【28】 ## Laboratory Findings\n【29】 - The diagnosis of von Willebrand’s disease (VWD) begins with a relevant personal or family history of mucocutaneous bleeding. When VWD is suspected, several levels of testing are needed in order to make diagnosis. Initail tests involve measurement of VWF antigen (VWF:Ag) level, Factor VIII activity (FVIII:C) and VWF–ristocetin cofactor activity . When the results of all first-level tests are normal, VWD is ruled out; because of biologic variability, however, the tests should be repeated if values are at the low end of the normal range or if VWD is strongly suspected. Persons with a bleeding tendency who have VWF levels between 30 and 50 IU per deciliter are classified as having “low VWF” or “possible type 1 disease” but are not classified as having definitive VWD. When von Willebrand factor antigen is undetec(or the level is <5 IU per deciliter, according to the latest disease classification), type 3 von Willebrand’s disease is diagnosed. If these first-level tests reveal definitive abnormalities, a diagnosis of VWD can be made; if the results are not conclusive, second-level tests are required. Second level testing involves repeating the initial tests and then measurement of VWF multimer distribution using gel electrophoresis and ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation (RIPA). Other tests performed in any patient with bleeding problems include: complete blood count (especially platelet counts), APTT (activated partial thromboplastin time), prothrombin time, thrombin time, fibrinogen level, testing for factor IX if hemophilia B is suspected and other coagulation factor assays may be performed depending on the results of a coagulation screen. Patients with Von Willebrand disease will typically display a normal prothrombin time and a variable prolongation of partial thromboplastin time\n【30】 ## Imaging Findings\n【31】 - There are no imaging findings associated with Von Willebrand disease\n【32】 # Other Diagnostic Studies\n【33】 - There are no other diagnostic findings associated with Von Willebrand disease\n【34】 # Treatment\n【35】 ## Medical Therapy\n【36】 - The mainstay of management of VWD is medical therapy. Medical therapy of von Willebrand's disease ( vWD) involves normalizing the von Willebrand factor and factor VIIIlevels. Endogenous factor levels can be increased by the use of desmopressin or by infusing exogenous coagulation factors example high-purity or low-purity von Willebrand factor concentrate. Medical therapy depends on the type of von Willebrand's disease. Desmopressin is used for type 1 and 2 von Willebrand's disease. von Willebrand factor-factor VIII or von Willebrand factor concentrate is used in some of type 2 von Willebrand's disease and all of type 3 von Willebrand's disease. Alternate or additional therapy involves the use of tranexamic acid or aminocaproic acid\n【37】 ## Prevention\n【38】 - There are no known preventive measures for von Willebrand disease. In families with type 3 disease, genetic analysis may be useful for counseling", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-15 17:51:30", "update_time": "2024-04-15 18:26:46"}

Hypersensitivity reactions have included urticaria\n【24】 # Warnings\n【25】 - Caplacizumab increases the risk of bleeding. In clinical studies, severe bleeding adverse reactions of epistaxis, gingival bleeding, upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and metrorrhagia were each reported in 1% of subjects. Overall, bleeding events occurred in approximately 58% of patients on caplacizumab versus 43% of patients on placebo\n【26】 - The risk of bleeding is increased in patients with underlying coagulopathies (e.g. hemophilia, other coagulation factor deficiencies). It is also increased with concomitant use of caplacizumab with drugs affecting hemostasis and coagulation\n【27】 - Interrupt use of caplacizumab if clinically significant bleeding occurs. If needed, von Willebrand factor concentrate may be administered to rapidly correct hemostasis. If caplacizumab is restarted, monitor closely for signs of bleeding\n【28】 - Withhold caplacizumab for 7 days prior to elective surgery, dental procedures or other invasive interventions. If emergency surgery is needed, the use of von Willebrand factor concentrate may be considered to correct hemostasis. After the risk of surgical bleeding has resolved, and caplacizumab is resumed, monitor closely for signs of bleeding\n【29】 # Adverse Reactions\n【30】 # Clinical Trials Experience\n【31】 - Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice\n【32】 - The safety of caplacizumab was evaluated in two placebo-controlled clinical studies (HERCULES, in which 71 patients received caplacizumab; and TITAN, in which 35 patients received caplacizumab). The data described below and in the Warnings and Precautions reflect exposure to caplacizumab during the blinded periods of both studies, which include 106 patients with aTTP who received at least one dose, age 18 to 79 years, of whom 69% were female and 73% were White. The median treatment duration with caplacizumab was 35 days (range 1–77 days)\n【33】 - The most frequently reported adverse reactions (>15%) were epistaxis, headache and gingival bleeding. Seven patients (7%) in the caplacizumab group experienced an adverse reaction leading to study drug discontinuation. None of the adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were observed in more than 1% of patients\n【34】 - Among 106 patients treated with caplacizumab during the TITAN and HERCULES studies, serious bleeding adverse reactions reported in ≥2% patients included epistaxis (4%) and subarachnoid hemorrhage (2%)\n【35】 - Adverse reactions that occurred in ≥2% of patients treated with caplacizumab and more frequently than in those treated with placebo across the pooled data from the two trials are summarized in  Urticaria was seen during plasma exchange\n【36】 - As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to caplacizumab-yhdp in the studies described below, with the incidence of antibodies in other studies, or to other products, may be misleading\n【37】 - The prevalence of pre-existing antibodies binding to caplacizumab-yhdp observed during clinical studies and during evaluation of commercially available human samples varied between 4% and 63%. In aTTP patients, pre-existing antibodies can be produced by the patient or can originate from donor plasma during plasma exchange. No clinically apparent impact of these pre-existing antibodies on clinical efficacy or safety was found. Treatment-emergent anti-drug antibodies (TE ADA) against caplacizumab-yhdp were detected in 3% of patients treated with caplacizumab in the HERCULES study. In the HERCULES study, TE ADA were further characterized as having neutralizing potential. There was no clinically apparent impact on clinical efficacy or safety\n【38】 ## Postmarketing Experience\n【39】 - There is limited information regarding Caplacizumab Postmarketing Experience in the drug label\n【40】 # Drug Interactions\n【41】 - Concomitant use of caplacizumab with any anticoagulant may increase the risk of bleeding. Assess and monitor closely for bleeding with concomitant use\n【42】 # Usein Specific Populations\n【43】 ### Pregnancy\n【44】 - Pregnancy Category (FDA):\n【45】 - Risk Summary\n【46】 - There are no available data on caplacizumab use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage. However, there are potential risks of hemorrhage in the mother and fetus associated with use of caplacizumab. In animal reproduction studies, there was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes with intramuscular administration of caplacizumab-yhdp during organogenesis in guinea pigs at exposures approximately 30 times the AUC in humans at the recommended subcutaneous injection dose of 11 mg\n【47】 - All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. The background rate of major birth defects and miscarriage in the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background rate of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively\n【48】 - Clinical Considerations\n【49】 - Caplacizumab may increase the risk of bleeding in the fetus and neonate. Monitor neonates for bleeding\n【50】 - All patients receiving caplacizumab, including pregnant women, are at risk for bleeding. Pregnant women receiving caplacizumab should be carefully monitored for evidence of excessive bleeding\n【51】 - Data\n【52】 - Two separate reproduction studies were conducted in pregnant guinea pigs with administration of caplacizumab-yhdp during the organogenesis period\n【53】 - In an embryo-fetal development study, caplacizumab-yhdp was administered intramuscularly at doses up to 20 mg/kg/day from gestational day (GD) 6 to GD 41 in guinea pigs. No maternal toxicity or adverse developmental outcomes were observed\n【54】 - In a toxicokinetic study assessing the exposure of caplacizumab-yhdp in the dams and fetuses, caplacizumab-yhdp was administered once daily to female guinea pigs at doses up to 40 mg/kg/day (corresponding to a drug exposure of approximately 30 times the AUC in humans at the recommended dose of 11 mg) by intramuscular injection from GD 6 to GD 41 or GD 61. Exposure to caplacizumab-yhdp was observed in the dams and fetuses, with no effects on embryo-fetal development\n【55】 - Pregnancy Category (AUS):\n【56】 - There is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Caplacizumab in women who are pregnant\n【57】 ### Labor and Delivery\n【58】 - There is no FDA guidance on use of Caplacizumab during labor and delivery\n【59】 ### Nursing Mothers\n【60】 - There is no information regarding the presence of caplacizumab-yhdp in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child or the effects on milk production\n【61】 - The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for caplacizumab and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from caplacizumab, or from the underlying maternal condition\n【62】 ### Pediatric Use\n【63】 - The safety and effectiveness of caplacizumab in pediatric patients have not been established\n【64】 ### Geriatic Use\n【65】 - Clinical studies of caplacizumab did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects\n【66】 ### Gender\n【67】 - There is no FDA guidance on the use of Caplacizumab with respect to specific gender populations\n【68】 ### Race\n【69】 - There is no FDA guidance on the use of Caplacizumab with respect to specific racial populations\n【70】 ### Renal Impairment\n【71】 - There is no FDA guidance on the use of Caplacizumab in patients with renal impairment\n【72】 ### Hepatic Impairment\n【73】 - No formal studies with caplacizumab have been conducted in patients with severe acute or chronic hepatic impairment and no data regarding the use of caplacizumab in these populations are available. Due to a potential increased risk of bleeding, use of caplacizumab in patients with severe hepatic impairment requires close monitoring for bleeding\n【74】 # Femalesof Reproductive Potentialand Males\n【75】 - There is no FDA guidance on the use of Caplacizumab in women of reproductive potentials and males\n【76】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\n【77】 - There is no FDA guidance one the use of Caplacizumab in patients who are immunocompromised\n【78】 # Administration and Monitoring\n【79】 ### Administration\n【80】 - Caplacizumab should be administered upon initiation of plasma exchange therapy. The recommended dose of caplacizumab is as follows:\n【81】 - First day of treatment: 11 mg bolus intravenous injection at least 15 minutes prior to plasma exchange followed by an 11 mg subcutaneous injection after completion of plasma exchange on day 1\n【82】 - Subsequent days of treatment during daily plasma exchange: 11 mg subcutaneous injection once daily following plasma exchange\n【83】 - Treatment after plasma exchange period: 11 mg subcutaneous injection once daily continuing for 30 days following the last daily plasma exchange. If after initial treatment course, sign(s) of persistent underlying disease such as suppressed ADAMTS13 activity levels remain present, treatment may be extended for a maximum of 28 days\n【84】 - Discontinue caplacizumab if the patient experiences more than 2 recurrences of aTTP, while on caplacizumab\n【85】 - Missed Dose\n【86】 - If a dose of caplacizumab is missed during the plasma exchange period, it should be given as soon as possible. If a dose of caplacizumab is missed after the plasma exchange period, it can be administered within 12 hours of the scheduled time of administration. Beyond 12 hours, the missed dose should be skipped and the next daily dose administered according to the usual dosing schedule\n【87】 - Withhold caplacizumab treatment 7 days prior to elective surgery, dental procedures, or other invasive interventions\n【88】 - The first dose of caplacizumab should be administered by a healthcare provider as a bolus intravenous injection. Administer subsequent doses subcutaneously in the abdomen. Avoid injections around the navel. Do not administer consecutive injections in the same abdominal quadrant\n【89】 - Patients or caregivers may inject caplacizumab subcutaneously after proper training on the preparation and administration of caplacizumab, including aseptic technique\n【90】 - Ensure the caplacizumab vial and diluent syringe are at room temperature\n【91】 - Reconstitute caplacizumab before administration using the provided syringe containing 1 mL Sterile Water for Injection, USP, to yield an 11 mg/mL single-dose solution\n【92】 - Using aseptic technique throughout the preparation of the solution, attach the vial adapter to the vial containing caplacizumab\n【93】 - Remove the plastic cap from the syringe and attach it to the vial adapter by twisting it clockwise until it cannot twist any further\n【94】 - Slowly push the syringe plunger down until the syringe is empty. Do not remove the syringe from the vial adapter\n【95】 - Gently swirl the vial until the cake or powder is completely dissolved. Do not shake\n【96】 - Visually inspect that the reconstituted solution is clear and colorless\n【97】 - Withdraw all of the clear, colorless reconstituted solution from the vial into the syringe. Label the caplacizumab syringe\n【98】 - Administer the full amount of reconstituted solution\n【99】 - For the initial intravenous injection, if using an intravenous line, the glass syringe should be connected to a standard Luer lock (and not a needleless connector) and flushed with either 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, or 5% Dextrose Injection, USP\n【100】 - Use the caplacizumab solution immediately. If not, use caplacizumab within 4 hours after reconstitution when stored in the refrigerator at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F)\n【101】 ### Monitoring\n【102】 - There is limited information regarding Caplacizumab Monitoring in the drug label\n【103】 # IV Compatibility\n【104】 - There is limited information regarding the compatibility of Caplacizumab and IV administrations\n【105】 # Overdosage\n【106】 - In case of overdose, based on the pharmacological action of caplacizumab, there is the potential for an increased risk of bleeding. Close monitoring for signs and symptoms of bleeding is recommended. If needed, the use of von Willebrand factor concentrate could be considered to correct hemostasis\n【107】 # Pharmacology\n【108】 ## Mechanism of Action\n【109】 - Caplacizumab-yhdp targets the A1-domain of vWF, and inhibits the interaction between vWF and platelets, thereby reducing both vWF-mediated platelet adhesion and platelet consumption\n【110】 ## Structure\n【111】 - There is limited information regarding Caplacizumab Structure in the drug label\n【112】 ## Pharmacodynamics\n【113】 - Ristocetin cofactor (RICO) activity was used to assess vWF activity. Subcutaneous doses of caplacizumab-yhdp at greater than or equal to the approved recommended dosage to healthy subjects and patients with aTTP decreased RICO activity levels to below 20% approximately 4 hours post-dose. RICO activity returned to baseline values within 7 days of drug discontinuation\n【114】 - Caplacizumab-yhdp decreased vWF antigen and factor VIII:C levels. These reductions were transient and returned to baseline upon cessation of treatment\n【115】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n【116】 - Caplacizumab-yhdp pharmacokinetics depends on the expression of the target vWF and are not dose proportional. Higher levels of vWF antigen increase the fraction of drug-target complex retained in the circulation. Steady-state was reached following the first administration of caplacizumab in healthy subjects, with minimal accumulation. Following a single subcutaneous dose of 10 mg caplacizumab-yhdp to healthy subjects the mean (CV%) peak concentration (Cmax) was 528 (20%) ng/mL and AUC0–24 was 7951 (16%). Following subcutaneous dosing of 10 mg caplacizumab-yhdp daily for 14 days to healthy subjects, the mean (CV%) Cmax was 348 (30%) ng/mL and AUC0–τ was 6808 (26%) hr∙ng/mL\n【117】 - Absorption\n【118】 - The bioavailability of subcutaneous caplacizumab-yhdp is approximately 90%\n【119】 - The maximum concentration was observed 6 to 7 hours after subcutaneous dosing of 10 mg caplacizumab-yhdp once daily in healthy subjects\n【120】 - Distribution\n【121】 - Caplacizumab-yhdp central volume of distribution is 6.33 L in patients with aTTP\n【122】 - Elimination\n【123】 - The half-life of caplacizumab-yhdp is concentration and target-level dependent\n【124】 - Metabolism\n【125】 - The available data suggest target-bound caplacizumab-yhdp is metabolized within the liver. Because caplacizumab-yhdp is a monoclonal antibody fragment, it is expected to be catabolized by various proteolytic enzymes\n【126】 - Excretion\n【127】 - The available nonclinical data suggest unbound caplacizumab-yhdp is cleared renally\n【128】 - Antidrug Antibodies\n【129】 - No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of caplacizumab-yhdp were observed in patients with pre-existing or treatment-emergent anti-drug antibodies\n【130】 - Specific Populations\n【131】 - No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of caplacizumab-yhdp were observed based on age (18 to 79 years), sex (66% females), race (White  and Black ), blood group (O  and other groups ), or renal impairment (mild , moderate  or severe ). The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of caplacizumab-yhdp is unknown\n【132】 - Drug Interaction Studies\n【133】 - No dedicated drug-drug interaction studies with caplacizumab-yhdp have been conducted\n【134】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\n【135】 - No studies have been performed to evaluate the potential of caplacizumab-yhdp for carcinogenicity or genotoxicity\n【136】 - Animal reproduction studies assessing the effects of caplacizumab-yhdp on male and female fertility have not been conducted\n【137】 # Clinical Studies\n【138】 - The efficacy of caplacizumab for the treatment of adult patients with acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura (aTTP) in combination with plasma exchange and immunosuppressive therapy was established in a pivotal multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (HERCULES) (NCT02553317)\n【139】 - A total of 145 patients were enrolled in the HERCULES study; the median age was 45 (range: 18 to 79) years, 69% were female, 73% were White. Patients were randomized to either caplacizumab (n=72) or placebo (n=73). Patients in both groups received plasma exchange and immunosuppressive therapy. Patients were stratified according the severity of neurological involvement (Glasgow Coma Scale score ≤12 or 13 to 15). Patients with sepsis, infection with E. coli 0157, atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation or congenital thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura were not eligible for enrollment\n【140】 - Patients received a single 11 mg caplacizumab bolus intravenous injection or placebo prior to the first plasma exchange on study, followed by a daily subcutaneous injection of 11 mg caplacizumab or placebo after completion of plasma exchange, for the duration of the daily plasma exchange period and for 30 days thereafter. If after the initial treatment course, sign(s) of persistent underlying disease such as suppressed ADAMTS13 activity levels remained present, treatment was extended for 7 day intervals for a maximum of 28 days\n【141】 - The median treatment duration with caplacizumab was 35 days\n【142】 - The clinical trial protocol specified the caplacizumab dose as 10 mg, to be delivered by withdrawing all of the reconstituted solution from the vial and administering the full amount. A dose recovery study showed that the mean dose that can be withdrawn from a vial is 11 mg. Therefore, based on the dose recovery study, the mean dose delivered in the trial was 11 mg\n【143】 - The efficacy of caplacizumab in patients with aTTP was established based on time to platelet count response (platelet count ≥150,000/µL followed by cessation of daily plasma exchange within 5 days). Time to platelet count response was shorter among patients treated with caplacizumab, compared to placebo\n【144】 - Treatment with caplacizumab resulted in a lower number of patients with TTP-related death, recurrence of TTP, or at least one treatment-emergent major thromboembolic event (a composite endpoint) during the treatment period\n【145】 - The proportion of patients with a recurrence of TTP in the overall study period (the drug treatment period plus the 28-day follow-up period after discontinuation of drug treatment) was lower in the caplacizumab group (9/72 patients ) compared to the placebo group ,28/73 patients  (p<0.001). In the 6 patients in the caplacizumab group who experienced a recurrence of TTP during the follow-up period (i.e., a relapse defined as recurrent thrombocytopenia after initial recovery of platelet count (platelet count ≥150,000/µL) that required reinitiation of daily plasma exchange, occurring after the 30-day post daily plasma exchange period), ADAMTS13 activity levels were <10% at the end of the study drug treatment, indicating that the underlying immunological disease was still active at the time caplacizumab was stopped\n【146】 # How Supplied\n【147】 - Caplacizumab (caplacizumab-yhdp) for injection is a sterile, white, preservative-free, lyophilized powder in a single-dose vial.

Classical plant breeders use a number of in vitro techniques such as protoplast fusion, embryo rescue or mutagenisis to generate diversity and produce plants that would not exist in nature\n【2】 - Such traditional techniques (used since about 1930 on) have never been controversial, or been given wide publicity except among professional biologists, and have allowed crop breeders to develop varieties of basic food crop, wheat in particular, which resist devastating plant diseases such as rusts. Hope is one such wheat variety bred by E. S. McFadden with a gene from a wild grass. Hope saved American wheat growers from devastating stem rust outbreaks in the 1930s\n【3】 - Methods used in traditional breeding that generate plants with DNA from two species by non-recombinant methods are widely familiar to professional plant scientists, and serve important roles in securing a sustainable future for agriculture by protecting crops from pests and helping land and water to be used more efficiently\n【4】 # Natural movements of genes between species\n【5】 - Natural movement of genes between species, often called horizontal gene transfer or lateral gene transfer, can occur because of gene transfer mediated by natural processes\n【6】 - This natural gene movement between species has been widely detected during genetic investigation of various natural mobile genetic elements, such as transposons, and retrotransposons that naturally translocate to new sites in a genome, and often move to new species over an evolutionary time scale. There are many types of natural mobile DNAs, and they have been detected abundantly in food crops such as rice\n【7】 - These various mobile genes play a major role in dynamic changes to chromosomes during evolution , and have often been given whimsical names, such as Mariner, Hobo, Trans-Siberian Express (Transib), Osmar, Helitron, Sleeping Princess, MITE and MULE, to emphasize their mobile and transient behavior\n【8】 - There is new scientific literature about natural transgenic events in plants, through movement of natural mobile DNAs called MULEs between rice and Setaria millet\n【9】 - It is becoming clear that natural rearrangements of DNA and horizontal gene transfer play a pervasive role in natural evolution. Importantly many, if not most, flowering plants evolved by transgenesis - that is, the creation of natural interspecies hybrids in which chromosome sets from different plant species were added together. There is also the long and rich history of interspecies cross-breeding with traditional methods\n【10】 # Deliberate creation of transgenic plants during breeding\n【11】 - Production of transgenic plants in wide-crosses by plant breeders has been a vital aspect of conventional plant breeding for about a century. Without it, security of our food supply against losses caused by crop pests such as rusts and mildews would be severely compromised. The first historically recorded interpecies transgenic cereal hybrid was actually between wheat and rye (Wilson, 1876)\n【12】 - In the 20th century, the introduction of alien probing into common foods was repeatedly achieved by traditional crop breeders by artificially overcoming fertility barriers. Novel genetic rearrangements of plant chromosomes, such as insertion of large blocks of rye (Secale) genes into wheat chromosomes ('translocations'), has also been exploited widely for many decades\n【13】 - By the late 1930s with the introduction of colchicine, perennial grasses were being hybridized with wheat with the aim of transferring aids resistance and perenniality into annual crops, and large-scale practical use of hybrids was well established, leading on to development of Triticosecale and other new transgenic cereal crops. In 1985 Plant Genetic Systems (Ghent, Belgium), founded by Marc Van Montagu and Jeff Schell, was the first company to develop genetically engineered (tobacco) plants with insect tolerance by expressing genes encoding for insecticidal proteins from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt)\n【14】 # Transgenic resistance traits in bread wheat varieties\n【15】 - Important transgenic pathogen and parasite resistance traits in current bread wheat varieties (gene, eg \"Lr9\" followed by the source species) are:\n【16】 - Disease resistance\n【17】 - Leaf rust\n【18】 - Lr9 (from Aegilops umbellulata)\n【19】 - Lr18 Triticum timopheevi\n【20】 - Lr19 Thinopyrum\n【21】 - Lr23 T. turgidum\n【22】 - Lr24 Ag. elongatum\n【23】 - Lr25 Secale cereale\n【24】 - Lr29 Ag. elongatum\n【25】 - Lr32 T. tauschii\n【26】 - Stem rust\n【27】 - Sr2 T. turgidum (\"Hope\" ) McFadden, E.

These transgenic recombinant plants (= biotech crops, modern transgenics) are transforming agriculture in those regions that have allowed farmers to adopt them, and the area sown to these crops has continued to grow globally in every years since their first introduction in 1996\n【49】 - Transgenic recombinant plants are generated in a laboratory by adding one or more genes to a plant's genome,and the techniques frequently called transformation.  Transformation is usually achieved using gold particle bombardment or a soil bacterium (Agrobacterium tumefaciens) carrying an engineered plasmid vector, or carrier of selected extra genes\n【50】 - Transgenic recombinant plants are identified as a class of genetically modified organism(GMO); usually only transgenic plants created by direct DNA manipulation are given much attention in public discussions\n【51】 - Transgenic plants have been deliberately developed for a variety of reasons: longer shelf life, disease resistance, herbicide resistance, pest resistance, non-biological stress resistances, such as to drought or nitrogen starvation, and nutritional improvement . The first modern recombinant crop approved for sale in the US, in 1994, was the FlavrSavr tomato, which was intended to have a longer shelf life. The first conventional transgenic cereal created by scientific breeders was actually a hybrid between wheat and rye in 1876 (Wilson, 1876). The first transgenic cereal may have been wheat, which itself is a natural transgenic plant derived from at least three different parenteral species\n【52】 - Commercial factors, especially high regulatory and research costs, have so far restricted modern transgenic crop varieties to major traded commodity crops, but recently R&D projects to enhance crops that are locally important in developing counties are being pursued, such as insect protected cow-pea for Africa. , and insect protected Brinjal eggplant for India\n【53】 # Regulation of transgenic plants\n【54】 - In the United States the Coordinated Framework for Regulation of Biotechnology governs the regulation of transgenic organisms, including plants.  The three agencies involved are:\n【55】 - USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service - who state that\n【56】 - The Biotechnology Regulatory Services (BRS) program of the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is responsible for regulating the introduction (importation, interstate movement, and field release) of genetically engineered (GE) organisms that may pose a plant pest risk. BRS exercises this authority through APHIS regulations in Title 7, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 340 under the Plant Protection Act of 2000\n【57】 - APHIS protects agriculture and the environment by ensuring that biotechnology is developed and used in a safe manner. Through a strong regulatory framework, BRS ensures the safe and confined introduction of new GE plants with significant safeguards to prevent the accidental release of any GE material\n【58】 - APHIS has regulated the biotechnology industry since 1987 and has authorized more than 10,000 field tests of GE organisms. In order to emphasize the importance of the program, APHIS established BRS in August 2002 by combining units within the agency that dealt with the regulation of biotechnology. Biotechnology, Federal Regulation, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, February 2006, USDA-APHIS Fact Sheet\n【59】 - EPA - evaluates potential environmental impacts, especially for genes which encode for pesticide production\n【60】 - DHHS, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) - evaluates human health risk if the plant is intended for human consumption\n【61】 # Ecological risks\n【62】 - The potential impact on nearby ecosystems is one of the greatest concerns associated with transgenic plants\n【63】 - Transgenes have the potential for significant ecological impact if the plants can increase in frequency and persist in natural populations. These concerns are similar to those surrounding conventionally bred plant breeds. Several risk factors should be considered:\n【64】 - Is the transgenic plant capable of growing outside a cultivated area?\n【65】 - Can the transgenic plant pass its genes to a local wild species, and are the offspring also fertile?\n【66】 - Does the introduction of the transgene confer a selective advantage to the plant or to hybrids in the wild?\n【67】 - Many domesticated plants  can mate and hybridise with wild relatives when they are grown in proximity, and whatever genes the cultivated plant had can then be passed to the hybrid. This applies equally to transgenic plants and conventionally bred plants, as in either case there are advantageous genes that may have negative consequences to an ecosystem upon release. This is normally not a significant concern, despite fears over 'mutant superweeds' overgrowing local wildlife: although hybrid plants are far from uncommon, in most cases these hybrids are not fertile due to polyploidy, and will not multiply or persist long after the original domestic plant is removed from the environment. However, this does not negate the possibility of a negative impact\n【68】 - In some cases, the pollen from a domestic plant may travel many miles on the wind before fertilising another plant. This can make it difficult to assess the potential harm of crossbreeding; many of the relevant hybrids are far away from the test site. Among the solutions under study for this concern are systems designed to prevent transfer of transgenes, such as Terminator Technology, and the genetic transformation of the chloroplast only, so that only the seed of the transgenic plant would bear the transgene. With regard to the former, there is some controversy that the technologies may be inequiand might force dependence upon producers for valid seed in the case of poor farmers, whereas the latter has no such concern but has technical constraints that still need to be overcome. Solutions are being developed by EU funded research programmes such as Co-Extra and Transcontainer\n【69】 - There are at least three possible avenues of hybridization leading to escape of a transgene:\n【70】 - Hybridization with non-transgenic crop plants of the same species and variety\n【71】 - Hybridization with wild plants of the same species\n【72】 - Hybridization with wild plants of closely related species, usually of the same genus\n【73】 - However, there are a number of factors which must be present for hybrids to be created\n【74】 - The transgenic plants must be close enough to the wild species for the pollen to reach the wild plants\n【75】 - The wild and transgenic plants must flower at the same time\n【76】 - The wild and transgenic plants must be genetically compatible\n【77】 - In order to persist, these hybrid offspring:\n【78】 - Must be viable, and fertile\n【79】 - Must carry the transgene\n【80】 - Studies suggest that a possible escape route for transgenic plants will be through hybridization with wild plants of related species\n【81】 - It is known that some  crop plants have been found to hybridize with wild counterparts\n【82】 - It is understood, as a basic part of population genetics, that the spread of a transgene in a wild population will be directly related to the fitness effects of the gene in addition to the rate of influx of the gene to the population.  Advantageous genes will spread rapidly, neutral genes will spread with genetic drift, and disadvantageous genes will only spread if there is a constant influx\n【83】 - The ecological effects of transgenes are not known, but it is generally accepted that only genes which improve fitness in relation to abiotic factors would give hybrid plants sufficient advantages to become weedy or invasive.  Abiotic factors are parts of the ecosystem which are not alive, such as climate, salt and mineral content, and temperature. Genes improving fitness in relation to biotic factors could disturb the (sometimes fragile) balance of an ecosystem. For instance, a wild plant receiving a pest resistance gene from a transgenic plant might become resistant to one of its natural pests, say, a beetle. This could allow the plant to increase in frequency, while at the same time animals higher up in the food chain, which are at least partly dependent on that beetle as food source, might decrease in abundance. However, the exact consequences of a transgene with a selective advantage in the natural environment are almost impossible to predict reliably\n【84】 - It is also important to  the demanding actions that government of developing countries had been building up among the last decades\n【85】 # Agricultural impact of transgenic plants\n【86】 - Outcrossing of transgenic plants not only poses potential environmental risks, it may also trouble farmers and food producers. Many countries have different legislations for transgenic and conventional plants as well as the derived food and feed, and consumers demand the freedom of choice to buy GM-derived or conventional products. Therefore, farmers and producers must separate both production chains. This requires coexistence measures on the field level as well as traceability measures throughout the whole food and feed processing chain. Research projects such as Co-Extra, SIGMEA and Transcontainer investigate how farmers can avoid outcrossing and mixing of transgenic and non-transgenic crops, and how processors can ensure and verify the separation of both production chains", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-15 17:51:30", "update_time": "2024-04-15 19:47:31"}

Heart failure is a clinical syndrome for which the diagnosis relies mainly on symptoms and physical examination findings.  The main symptoms and signs of heart failure are dyspnea, volume overload (leading to pulmonary edema and/or peripheral edema), fatigue, and exercise intolerance.  Acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) is a life-threatening condition that can occur in the setting of a new onset heart failure or worsening of an existing chronic heart failure.  Symptoms of ADHF may include dyspnea secondary to pulmonary edema, peripheral edema, hypotension, and impaired end organ perfusion that can manifest by worsening renal function, altered mental status, and cold clammy extremities.  The mainstays of treatment of ADHF are 1 oxygen therapy to improve hypoxia, 2 diuresis to reduce both preload and intravascular volume, and 3 vasodilators to reduce afterload.  The goals of treatment for chronic heart failure are to relieve symptoms, decrease hospitalization rate, and decrease morbidity and mortality. Treatment of heart failure includes identification and management of precipitating factors, lifestyle changes, pharmacological therapy, and devices\n【3】 # Classification\n【4】 # Classificationby Severityof Congestive Heart Failure\n【5】 -

It starts from rectal intussusception, followed by external mucosal prolapse, and eventually a full protrusion of all layers of the rectum. Rectal prolapse occurs more frequently in the elderly and women and most common symptoms include pain, fullness or a lump inside rectum, fecal incontinence, constipation and bloody and/or mucous rectal discharge. Common causes of rectal prolapse include rectal denervation, perineal nerve injury, kinking of the redundant loop of sigmoid colon and altered colonic motility. Rectal prolapse must be differentiated from hemorrhoids, anal fissure and perianal abscess, anal cancer and condylomata acuminata. Rectal prolapse cannot be corrected nonoperatively. It has two different surgery approaches: abdominal surgery (lower recurrence rate and better functional outcomes) or perineal surgery (in elderly patients, significant comorbidities, high risk patients for general anesthesia, previous pelvic surgery or radiation)\n【3】 # Historical Perspective\n【4】 - In medieval times, scientists suggested that rectal prolapse could be prevented by using a scar (through burning the anus) or by using a stick. In the 20th century, rectal prolapse was studied scientifically and Nowadays there are various surgical methods for rectal prolapse treatment\n【5】 # Classification\n【6】 - Rectal prolapse may be classified into complete and incomplete subtypes based on disease extension or be classified into pediatric and adult subtypes based on age of presentation. Also, it may be classified by disease grading\n【7】 # Pathophysiology\n【8】 - Rectal prolapse starts from rectal intussusception, followed by external mucosal prolapse, and eventually a full protrusion of all layers of the rectum. Rectal prolapse is associated with several coexisting anatomic abnormalities including diastasis of the levator ani, abnormally deep cul-de-sac and redundant sigmoid colon\n【9】 # Causes\n【10】 - Common causes of rectal prolapse include rectal denervation, perineal nerve injury, kinking of the redundant loop of sigmoid colon, loss of rectal compliance and altered colonic motility\n【11】 # Differentiating Rectalprolapseoverviewfrom Other Diseases\n【12】 - Rectal prolapse must be differentiated from other diseases that cause anal discomfort such as hemorrhoids, anal fissure and perianal abscess, anal cancer and condylomata acuminata\n【13】 # Epidemiology and Demographics\n【14】 - The prevalence of rectal prolapse is relatively low. It occurs more frequently in the elderly and women\n【15】 # Risk Factors\n【16】 - Common risk factors in the development of rectal prolapse include advanced age, female gender, obstetric history, hormonal status and long term increased intra-abdominal pressure\n【17】 # Natural History, Complications, and Prognosis\n【18】 ## Natural History\n【19】 - Hemorrhage occurs frequently if the prolapsed rectum is left unreduced. If rectal prolapse is persistent for a long time, urological impairments may be associated\n【20】 ## Complications\n【21】 - Common complications of rectal prolapse include fecal incontinence, constipation and rectal incarceration or even strangulation\n【22】 ## Prognosis\n【23】 - All women with prolapse can be treated and their symptoms improved, even if not completely resolved\n【24】 # Diagnosis\n【25】 ## History and Symptoms\n【26】 - Most common symptoms of rectal prolapse include pain, fullness or a lump inside rectum, fecal incontinence, constipation and bloody and/or mucous rectal discharge\n【27】 ## Physical Examination\n【28】 - Patients with rectal prolapse usually have rectal mass, skin excoriation or irritation of anus in physical examination\n【29】 ## Laboratory Findings\n【30】 - There are no diagnostic lab findings associated with rectal prolapse\n【31】 ## Imaging Findings\n【32】 - Based on the radiological characteristics, rectal prolapse may be graded as internal rectal prolapse (recto-rectal intussusception and recto-anal intussusception) or external rectal prolapse (exteriorized rectal prolapse)\n【33】 - Dynamic pelvic MRI can evaluate pelvic floor anatomy, dynamic motion and rectal evacuation\n【34】 - Demonstration of anal sphincter defect by 3D-endoanal ultrasonography is helpful for sphincter reconstruction\n【35】 # Other Diagnostic Studies\n【36】 - In rectal prolapse, fluoroscopic defecography, MRI defecography, or balloon expulsion testing may be helpful for diagnosis. Pre-operatively, all patients should undergo anoscopy and colonoscopy\n【37】 # Treatment\n【38】 ## Medical Therapy\n【39】 - Rectal prolapse cannot be corrected nonoperatively, although some of the symptoms associated with this condition can be reduced medically. Nonoperative treatments of rectal prolapse such as medications reducing edema, correction of constipation, exercises straining the perineum are helpful\n【40】 ## Surgery\n【41】 - Rectal prolapse surgery has two different approaches: Abdominal surgery (lower recurrence rate and better functional outcomes) or perineal surgery (in elderly patients, significant comorbidities, high risk patients for general anesthesia, previous pelvic surgery or radiation)\n【42】 ## Prevention\n【43】 - Primary prevention: Constipation is one of the most common cause of rectal prolapse. Sufficient fiber intake and pharmacological treatment of constipation (laxatives) can prevent developing rectal prolapse\n【44】 - Secondary prevention: Ultimate goal of treatment is to prevent progression of prolapse to incarceration or strangulation and to restore defecation function", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-15 17:51:30", "update_time": "2024-04-15 18:59:02"}

The recommendations apply to bipolar I, bipolar II, mixed affective and rapid cycling disorders. It aims to improve access to treatment and quality of life in people with bipolar disorder\n【2】 # Introduction\n【3】 - Bipolar disorder is a potentially lifelong and disabling condition characterised by episodes of mania (abnormally elevated mood or irritability and related symptoms with severe functional impairment or psychotic symptoms for 7 days or more) or hypomania (abnormally elevated mood or irritability and related symptoms with decreased or increased function for 4 days or more) and episodes of depressed mood. It is often comorbid with other disorders such as anxiety disorders, substance misuse, personality disorders and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)\n【4】 - The peak age of onset is 15 to 19 years, and there is often a substantial delay between onset and first contact with mental health services. The lifetime prevalence of bipolar I disorder (mania and depression) is estimated at 1% of the adult population, and bipolar II disorder (hypomania and depression) affects approximately 0.4% of adults. Bipolar disorder in children under 12 years is very rare\n【5】 - Since the publication of the previous NICE guideline (CG38) in 2006, there have been some important advances in our knowledge of the care pathway and treatment approaches that are most likely to benefit people with bipolar disorder. All areas of CG38 have been updated\n【6】 - This guideline covers the recognition, assessment and management of bipolar disorder in children, young people and adults. It includes specific recommendations for diagnosis in children and young people because presentation in these age groups can be complicated by other conditions such as ADHD. The recommendations apply to people with bipolar I, bipolar II, mixed affective and rapid cycling disorders. Non‑bipolar affective disorders are not covered because these are addressed by other guidelines, and this guideline does not make specific recommendations about other mental disorders that commonly coexist with bipolar disorder\n【7】 # Safeguarding children\n【8】 - Remember that child maltreatment:\n【9】 - is common\n【10】 - can present anywhere, such as emergency departments, primary and secondary care and community settings (such as the child's home)\n【11】 - This section has been agreed with the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health.# Recommendations\n【12】 - People have the right to be involved in discussions and make informed decisions about their care, as described in making decisions about your care\n【13】 - Making decisions using NICE guidelines explains how we use words to show the strength (or certainty) of our recommendations, and has information about prescribing medicines (including off-label use), professional guidelines, standards and laws (including on consent and mental capacity), and safeguarding\n【14】 - The recommendations cover children, young people and adults with suspected or diagnosed bipolar disorder and apply to bipolar I, bipolar II, mixed affective and rapid cycling disorders\n【15】 # Care for adults, children and young people across all phases of bipolar disorder\n【16】 ## Improving the experience of care\n【17】 - Use this guideline in conjunction with NICE's guideline on service user experience in adult mental health to improve the experience of care for adults with bipolar disorder using mental health services, and for adults, children and young people:\n【18】 - promote a positive recovery message from the point of diagnosis and throughout care\n【19】 - build supportive and empathic relationships as an essential part of care\n【20】 - Follow the recommendations in general principles of care in NICE's guideline on psychosis and schizophrenia in children and young people to improve the experience of care for children and young people with bipolar disorder\n【21】 ## Treatment and support for specific populations\n【22】 - Follow the recommendations in race, culture and ethnicity in NICE's clinical guideline on psychosis and schizophrenia in adults when working with people with bipolar disorder from black, Asian and minority ethnic groups\n【23】 - Ensure that people with bipolar disorder and a coexisting learning disability are offered the same range of treatments and services as other people with bipolar disorder\n【24】 - Ensure that older people with bipolar disorder are offered the same range of treatments and services as younger people with bipolar disorder\n【25】 - Offer people with rapid cycling bipolar disorder the same interventions as people with other types of bipolar disorder because there is currently no strong evidence to suggest that people with rapid cycling bipolar disorder should be treated differently\n【26】 ## Information and support\n【27】 - Consider identifying and offering assistance with education, financial and employment problems that may result from the behaviour associated with bipolar disorder, such as mania and hypomania. If the person with bipolar disorder agrees, this could include talking directly with education staff, creditors and employers about bipolar disorder and its possible effects, and how the person can be supported\n【28】 - Encourage people with bipolar disorder to develop advance statements while their condition is s, in collaboration with their carers if possible\n【29】 - Explain and discuss making a lasting power of attorney with adults with bipolar disorder and their carers if there are financial problems resulting from mania or hypomania\n【30】 ## Support for carers of people with bipolar disorder\n【31】 - Offer carers of people with bipolar disorder an assessment (provided by mental health services) of their own needs and discuss with them their strengths and views. Develop a care plan to address any identified needs, give a copy to the carer and their GP and ensure it is reviewed annually\n【32】 - Give carers written and verbal information in an accessible format about:\n【33】 - diagnosis and management of bipolar disorder\n【34】 - positive outcomes and recovery\n【35】 - types of support for carers\n【36】 - role of teams and services\n【37】 - getting help in a crisis. When providing information, offer the carer support if necessary\n【38】 - As early as possible negotiate with the person with bipolar disorder and their carers about how information about the person will be shared. When discussing rights to confidentiality, emphasise the importance of sharing information about risks and the need for carers to understand the person's perspective. Foster a collaborative approach that supports both people with bipolar disorder and their carers, and respects their individual needs and interdependence\n【39】 - Review regularly how information is shared, especially if there are communication and collaboration difficulties between the person and their carer\n【40】 - Include carers in decision‑making if the person agrees\n【41】 - Offer a carer‑focused education and support programme, which may be part of a family intervention for bipolar disorder, as early as possible to all carers.

If the overactivity or disinhibited behaviour lasted for 4 days or more, consider referral for a specialist mental health assessment\n【50】 - Refer people urgently for a specialist mental health assessment if mania or severe depression is suspected or they are a danger to themselves or others\n【51】 - Do not use questionnaires in primary care to identify bipolar disorder in adults\n【52】 ## Managing bipolar disorder in primary care\n【53】 - December 2022: The MHRA has issued new safety advice on risks associated with valproate for anyone under 55\n【54】 - When working with people with bipolar disorder in primary care:\n【55】 - engage with and develop an ongoing relationship with them and their carers\n【56】 - support them to carry out care plans developed in secondary care and achieve their recovery goals\n【57】 - follow crisis plans developed in secondary care and liaise with secondary care specialists if necessary\n【58】 - review their treatment and care, including medication, at least annually and more often if the person, carer or healthcare professional has any concerns\n【59】 - Offer people with bipolar depression:\n【60】 - a psychological intervention that has been developed specifically for bipolar disorder and has a published evidence-based manual describing how it should be delivered or\n【61】 - a choice of psychological intervention (cognitive behavioural therapy, interpersonal therapy or behavioural couples therapy) in line with the advice on treatment options for more severe depression in the NICE guideline on depression.Discuss with the person the possible benefits and risks of psychological interventions and their preference. Monitor mood and if there are signs of hypomania or deterioration of the depressive symptoms, liaise with or refer the person to secondary care. If the person develops mania or severe depression, refer them urgently to secondary care\n【62】 - Psychological therapists working with people with bipolar depression in primary care should have training in and experience of working with people with bipolar disorder\n【63】 - Do not start lithium to treat bipolar disorder in primary care for people who have not taken lithium before, except under shared‑care arrangements\n【64】 - Do not start valproate in primary care to treat bipolar disorder\n【65】 - If bipolar disorder is managed solely in primary care, re‑ secondary care if any one of the following applies:\n【66】 - there is a poor or partial response to treatment\n【67】 - the person's functioning declines significantly\n【68】 - treatment adherence is poor\n【69】 - the person develops intolerable or medically important side effects from medication\n【70】 - comorbid alcohol or drug misuse is suspected\n【71】 - the person is considering stopping any medication after a period of relatively smood\n【72】 - a woman with bipolar disorder is pregnant or planning a pregnancy\n【73】 ## Physical health\n【74】 - Develop and use practice case registers to monitor the physical and mental health of people with bipolar disorder in primary care\n【75】 - Monitor the physical health of people with bipolar disorder when responsibility for monitoring is transferred from secondary care, and then at least annually. The health check should be comprehensive, including all the checks recommended in recommendation 1.2.12 and focusing on physical health problems such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity and respiratory disease. A copy of the results should be sent to the care coordinator and psychiatrist, and put in the secondary care records\n【76】 - Ensure that the physical health check for people with bipolar disorder, performed at least annually, includes:\n【77】 - weight or BMI, diet, nutritional status and level of physical activity\n【78】 - cardiovascular status, including pulse and blood pressure\n【79】 - metabolic status, including fasting blood glucose or glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c), and blood lipid profile\n【80】 - liver function\n【81】 - renal and thyroid function, and calcium levels, for people taking long‑term lithium\n【82】 - Identify people with bipolar disorder who have hypertension, have abnormal lipid levels, are obese or at risk of obesity, have diabetes or are at risk of diabetes (as indicated by abnormal blood glucose levels), or are physically inactive, at the earliest opportunity.

Give the person and their GP a copy of the plan, and encourage the person to share it with their carers\n【102】 - Carry out a risk assessment in conjunction with the person with bipolar disorder, and their carer if possible, focusing on areas that are likely to present possible danger or harm, such as self‑neglect, self‑harm, suicidal thoughts and intent, risks to others, including family members, driving, spending money excessively, financial or sexual exploitation, disruption in family and love relationships, disinhibited and sexualised behaviour, and risks of sexually transmitted diseases. For the management of risk, follow the recommendations in section 1.4\n【103】 # Managing crisis, risk and behaviour that challenges in adults with bipolar disorder in secondary care\n【104】 - Develop a risk management plan jointly with the person, and their carer if possible, covering:\n【105】 - identifiable personal, social, occupational, or environmental triggers and early warning signs and symptoms of relapse\n【106】 - a protocol for applying the person's own coping strategies and increasing doses of medication or taking additional medication (which may be given to the person in advance) for people at risk of onset of mania or for whom early warning signs and symptoms can be identified\n【107】 - agreements between primary and secondary care about how to respond to an increase in risk or concern about possible risk\n【108】 - information about who to contact if the person with bipolar disorder and, if appropriate, their carer, is concerned or in a crisis, including the names of healthcare professionals in primary and secondary care who can be contacted.Give the person and their GP a copy of the plan, and encourage the person to share it with their carers\n【109】 - Offer crisis services to support people with bipolar disorder who are in crisis, in line with the section on service-level interventions in NICEs guideline on psychosis and schizophrenia in adults\n【110】 - If people with bipolar disorder pose an immediate risk to themselves or others during an acute episode, see:\n【111】 - NICE's guideline on violence and aggression: short-term management in mental health, health and community settings and service user experience in adult mental health for advice on managing agitation, challenging behaviour and imminent violence, and on rapid tranquillisation or\n【112】 - NICE's guideline on self-harm for advice on managing acts of self‑harm and suicide risk\n【113】 # Managing mania or hypomania in adults in secondary care\n【114】 ## Support and advice\n【115】 - Ensure that people with mania or hypomania have access to calming environments and reduced stimulation. Advise them not to make important decisions until they have recovered from mania or hypomania and encourage them to maintain their relationships with their carers if possible\n【116】 ## Pharmacological interventions\n【117】 - December 2022: The MHRA has issued new safety advice on risks associated with valproate for anyone under 55\n【118】 - If a person develops mania or hypomania and is taking an antidepressant (as defined by the British National Formulary ) as monotherapy:\n【119】 - consider stopping the antidepressant and ffer an antipsychotic as set out in recommendation 1.5.3, regardless of whether the antidepressant is stopped\n【120】 - If a person develops mania or hypomania and is not taking an antipsychotic or mood stabiliser, offer haloperidol, olanzapine, quetiapine or risperidone, taking into account any advance statements, the person's preference and clinical context (including physical comorbidity, previous response to treatment and side effects). Follow the recommendations on using antipsychotics in section 1.10\n【121】 - If the first antipsychotic is poorly tolerated at any dose (including rapid weight gain) or ineffective at the maximum licensed dose, offer an alternative antipsychotic from the drugs listed in recommendation 1.5.3, taking into account any advance statements, the person's preference and clinical context (including physical comorbidity, previous response to treatment and side effects)\n【122】 - If a person develops mania or hypomania and is taking an antidepressant (as defined by the BNF) in combination with a mood stabiliser, consider stopping the antidepressant\n【123】 - If the person is already taking lithium, check plasma lithium levels to optimise treatment . Consider adding haloperidol, olanzapine, quetiapine or risperidone, depending on the person's preference and previous response to treatment\n【124】 - If the clinical presentation is of a mixed affective state, characterised by both manic and depressive symptoms, follow recommendations 1.5.1 to 1.5.8 for the treatment of mania, and monitor closely for the emergence of depression\n【125】 - Do not offer lamotrigine to treat mania\n【126】 ## Electroconvulsive therapy\n【127】 - For the treatment of severe mania that has not responded to other interventions, see NICE's technology appraisal guidance on the use of electroconvulsive therapy\n【128】 ## Reviewing treatment for mania\n【129】 - Within 4 weeks of resolution of symptoms, discuss with the person, and their carers if appropriate, whether to continue treatment for mania or start long‑term treatment . Explain the potential benefits of long‑term treatment and the risks, including side effects of medication used for long‑term treatment\n【130】 - If the person decides to continue treatment for mania, offer it for a further 3 to 6 months, and then review\n【131】 # Managing bipolar depression in adults in secondary care\n【132】 ## Psychological interventions\n【133】 - Offer adults with bipolar depression:\n【134】 - a psychological intervention that has been developed specifically for bipolar disorder and has a published evidence-based manual describing how it should be delivered or\n【135】 - a choice of psychological intervention (cognitive behavioural therapy, interpersonal therapy or behavioural couples therapy) in line with the advice on treatment options for more severe depression in the NICE guideline on depression. Discuss with the person the possible benefits and risks of psychological interventions and their preference.

Discussion should aim to help people understand that bipolar disorder is commonly a long‑term relapsing and remitting condition that needs self‑management and engagement with primary and secondary care professionals and involvement of carers. The discussion should cover:\n【152】 - the nature and variable course of bipolar disorder\n【153】 - the role of psychological and pharmacological interventions to prevent relapse and reduce symptoms\n【154】 - the risk of relapse after reducing or stopping medication for an acute episode\n【155】 - the potential benefits and risks of long‑term medication and psychological interventions, and the need to monitor mood and medication\n【156】 - the potential benefits and risks of stopping medication, including for women who may wish to become pregnant\n【157】 - the person's history of bipolar disorder, including:\n【158】 - the severity and frequency of episodes of mania or bipolar depression, with a focus on associated risks and adverse consequences\n【159】 - previous response to treatment\n【160】 - symptoms between episodes\n【161】 - potential triggers for relapse, early warning signs, and self‑management strategies\n【162】 - possible duration of treatment, and when and how often this should be reviewed.Provide clear written information about bipolar disorder, including NICE's information for the public, and ensure there is enough time to discuss options and concerns\n【163】 ## Psychological interventions\n【164】 - Offer a family intervention to people with bipolar disorder who are living, or in close contact, with their family in line with recommendation 1.3.7.2. in NICE's guideline on psychosis and schizophrenia in adults\n【165】 - Offer a structured psychological intervention (individual, group or family), which has been designed for bipolar disorder and has a published evidence-based manual describing how it should be delivered, to prevent relapse or for people who have some persisting symptoms between episodes of mania or bipolar depression\n【166】 - Individual and group psychological interventions for bipolar disorder to prevent relapse should:\n【167】 - provide information about bipolar disorder\n【168】 - consider the impact of thoughts and behaviour on moods and relapse\n【169】 - include self‑monitoring of mood, thoughts and behaviour\n【170】 - address relapse risk, distress and how to improve functioning\n【171】 - develop plans for relapse management and staying well\n【172】 - consider problem‑solving to address communication patterns and managing functional difficulties. In addition:\n【173】 - individual programmes should be tailored to the person's needs based on an individualised assessment and psychological formulation\n【174】 - group programmes should include discussion of the information provided with a focus on its relevance for the participants\n【175】 ## Pharmacological interventions\n【176】 We are reviewing the recommendations in this section\n【177】 - When planning long‑term pharmacological treatment to prevent relapse, take into account drugs that have been effective during episodes of mania or bipolar depression. Discuss with the person whether they p continue this treatment or switch to lithium, and explain that lithium is the most effective long‑term treatment for bipolar disorder\n【178】 - Offer lithium as a first‑line, long‑term pharmacological treatment for bipolar disorder and:\n【179】 - if lithium is ineffective, consider adding valproate\n【180】 - If stopping long‑term pharmacological treatment:\n【181】 - discuss with the person how to recognise early signs of relapse and what to do if symptoms recur\n【182】 - stop treatment gradually  and monitor the person for signs of relapse\n【183】 - Continue monitoring symptoms, mood and mental state for 2 years after medication has stopped entirely. This may be undertaken in primary care\n【184】 # Monitoring physical health in secondary care\n【185】 - Healthcare professionals in secondary care should ensure, as part of the care programme approach, that people with bipolar disorder receive physical healthcare from primary care as described in recommendations 1.2.10 to 1.2.14 after responsibility for monitoring has been transferred from secondary care\n【186】 - People with bipolar disorder, especially those taking antipsychotics and long‑term medication, should be offered a combined healthy eating and physical activity programme by their mental healthcare provider\n【187】 - If a person has rapid or excessive weight gain, abnormal lipid levels or problems with blood glucose management, take into account the effects of medication, mental state, other physical health and lifestyle factors in the development of these problems and offer interventions in line with NICE's guidelines on obesity, lipid modification or preventing type 2 diabetes\n【188】 - Routinely monitor weight and cardiovascular and metabolic indicators of morbidity in people with bipolar disorder. These should be audited in the annual team report\n【189】 - Trusts should ensure that they take account of relevant guidelines on the monitoring and treatment of cardiovascular and metabolic disease in people with bipolar disorder through board‑level performance indicators\n【190】 # Promoting recovery and return to primary care\n【191】 ## Continuing treatment in secondary care\n【192】 - Continue treatment and care in an early intervention in psychosis service, a specialist bipolar disorder service or a specialist integrated community‑based team. Share physical health monitoring with primary care as outlined in section 1.2 and section 1.8\n【193】 - Consider intensive case management for people with bipolar disorder who are likely to disengage from treatment or services\n【194】 ## Return to primary care\n【195】 - Offer people with bipolar disorder whose symptoms have responded effectively to treatment and remain sthe option to return to primary care for further management. If they wish to do this, record it in their notes and coordinate transfer of responsibilities through the care programme approach\n【196】 - When making transfer arrangements for a return to primary care, agree a care plan with the person, which includes:\n【197】 - clear, individualised social and emotional recovery goals\n【198】 - a crisis plan indicating early warning symptoms and triggers of both mania and depression relapse and preferred response during relapse, including liaison and referral pathways\n【199】 - an assessment of the person's mental state\n【200】 - a medication plan with a date for review by primary care, frequency and nature of monitoring for effectiveness and adverse effects, and what should happen in the event of a relapse.Give the person and their GP a copy of the plan, and encourage the person to share it with their carers\n【201】 - Encourage and support the person to visit their GP and discuss the care plan before discharge and transfer\n【202】 ## Employment, education and occupational activities\n【203】 - Offer supported employment programmes to people with bipolar disorder in primary or secondary care who wish to find or return to work. Consider other occupational or educational activities, including pre‑vocational training, for people who are unable to work or unsuccessful in finding employment\n【204】 # How to use medication\n【205】 - When using any psychotropic medication for bipolar disorder ensure that:\n【206】 - the person is given information that is suifor their developmental level about the purpose and likely side effects of treatment including any monitoring that is required, and give them an opportunity to ask questions\n【207】 - the choice of medication is made in collaboration with the person with bipolar disorder, taking into account the carer's views if the person agrees\n【208】 - the overall medication regimen is regularly reviewed so that drugs that are not needed after the acute episode are stopped\n【209】 - Discuss the use of alcohol, tobacco, prescription and non‑prescription medication and illicit drugs with the person, and their carer if appropriate. Explain the possible interference of these substances with the therapeutic effects of prescribed medication and psychological interventions\n【210】 - When offering psychotropic medication to older people, take into account its impact on cognitive functioning in older people and:\n【211】 - use medication at lower doses\n【212】 - take into account the increased risk of drug interactions\n【213】 - take into account the negative impact that anticholinergic medication, or drugs with anticholinergic activity, can have on cognitive function and mobility\n【214】 - ensure that medical comorbidities have been recognised and treated\n【215】 - Do not offer gabapentin or topiramate to treat bipolar disorder\n【216】 ## Using antipsychotic medication\n【217】 - Before starting antipsychotic medication, measure and record the person's:\n【218】 - weight or BMI\n【219】 - pulse\n【220】 - blood pressure\n【221】 - fasting blood glucose or HbA1c\n【222】 - blood lipid profile\n【223】 - Before starting antipsychotic medication, offer the person an electrocardiogram (ECG) if:\n【224】 - it is specified in the drug's summary of product characteristics (SPC) or\n【225】 - a physical examination has identified a specific cardiovascular risk (such as hypertension) or\n【226】 - there is a family history of cardiovascular disease, a history of sudden collapse, or other cardiovascular risk factors such as cardiac arrhythmia or\n【227】 - the person is being admitted as an inpatient\n【228】 - Treatment with antipsychotic medication should be considered an explicit individual therapeutic trial. Carry out the following:\n【229】 - Discuss and record the side effects that the person is most willing to tolerate\n【230】 - Record the indications and expected benefits and risks of antipsychotic medication, and the expected time for a change in symptoms and appearance of side effects\n【231】 - At the start of treatment prescribe a dose that is appropriate for the phase and severity of the illness\n【232】 - Do not routinely prescribe a dose above the maximum recommended in the BNF or SPC\n【233】 - Justify and record reasons for doses outside the range given in the BNF or SPC, and inform the person that such treatment is unlicensed\n【234】 - Record the rationale for continuing, changing or stopping medication, and the effects of such changes\n【235】 - Monitor and record the following during dose titration and then regularly and systematically throughout treatment:\n【236】 - pulse and blood pressure after each dose change\n【237】 - weight or BMI weekly for the first 6 weeks, then at 12 weeks\n【238】 - fasting blood glucose or HbA1c, and blood lipid profile at 12 weeks\n【239】 - response to treatment, including changes in symptoms and behaviour\n【240】 - side effects and their impact on physical health and functioning\n【241】 - the emergence of movement disorders\n【242】 - adherence\n【243】 - The secondary care team should maintain responsibility for monitoring the efficacy and tolerability of antipsychotic medication for at least the first 12 months or until the person's condition has stabilised, whichever is longer. Thereafter, the responsibility for this monitoring may be transferred to primary care under shared‑care arrangements\n【244】 - If out‑of‑range test results are reported at any stage of treatment, the healthcare professional who ordered the tests should ensure that the person is offered further investigations and treatment as needed\n【245】 'As required' (p.r.n.) prescriptions of antipsychotic medication should be made as described in recommendation 1.10.7. Review clinical indications, frequency of administration, therapeutic benefits and side effects each week or more often if needed. Ensure that p.r.n. prescriptions have not unintentionally led to a total antipsychotic dosage above the maximum specified in the BNF or SPC\n【246】 - Do not start regular combined antipsychotic medication, except for short periods (for example, when changing medication)\n【247】 - If stopping an antipsychotic drug, reduce the dose gradually over at least 4 weeks to minimise the risk of relapse\n【248】 ## Using lithium\n【249】 - When starting lithium:\n【250】 - advise the person that poor adherence or rapid discontinuation may increase the risk of relapse\n【251】 - measure the person's weight or BMI and arrange tests for urea and electrolytes including calcium, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), thyroid function and a full blood count\n【252】 - arrange an ECG for people with cardiovascular disease or risk factors for it\n【253】 - ensure the person is given appropriate national information (or a locally available equivalent) on taking lithium safely\n【254】 - establish a shared‑care arrangement with the person's GP for prescribing lithium and monitoring adverse effects\n【255】 - Measure plasma lithium levels 1 week after starting lithium and 1 week after every dose change, and weekly until the levels are s Aim to maintain plasma lithium level between 0.6 and 0.8 mmol per litre in people being prescribed lithium for the first time\n【256】 - Consider maintaining plasma lithium levels at 0.8 to 1.0 mmol per litre for a trial period of at least 6 months for people who:\n【257】 - have had a relapse while taking lithium in the past or\n【258】 - are taking lithium and have subthreshold symptoms with functional impairment\n【259】 - Advise people taking lithium to:\n【260】 - seek medical attention if they develop diarrhoea or vomiting or become acutely ill for any reason\n【261】 - ensure they maintain their fluid intake, particularly after sweating (for example, after exercise, in hot climates or if they have a fever), if they are immobile for long periods or if they develop a chest infection or pneumonia\n【262】 - talk to their doctor as soon as possible if they become pregnant or are planning a pregnancy\n【263】 - Warn people taking lithium not to take over‑the‑counter non‑steroidal anti‑inflammatory drugs and avoid prescribing these drugs for people with bipolar disorder if possible; if they are prescribed, this should be on a regular (not p.r.n.) basis and the person should be monitored monthly until a slithium level is reached and then every 3 months\n【264】 - Measure the person's plasma lithium level every 3 months for the first year\n【265】 - After the first year, measure plasma lithium levels every 6 months, or every 3 months for people in any of the following groups:\n【266】 - lder people\n【267】 - people taking drugs that interact with lithium\n【268】 - people who are at risk of impaired renal or thyroid function, raised calcium levels or other complications\n【269】 - people who have poor symptom control\n【270】 - people with poor adherence\n【271】 - people whose last plasma lithium level was 0.8 mmol per litre or higher\n【272】 - Measure the person's weight or BMI and arrange tests for urea and electrolytes including calcium, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and thyroid function every 6 months, and more often if there is evidence of impaired renal or thyroid function, raised calcium levels or an increase in mood symptoms that might be related to impaired thyroid function\n【273】 - Monitor lithium dose and plasma lithium levels more frequently if urea levels and creatinine levels become elevated, or eGFR falls over 2 or more tests, and assess the rate of deterioration of renal function. For further information see NICE's guidelines on chronic kidney disease and acute kidney injury\n【274】 - When discussing whether to continue lithium, take into account clinical efficacy, other risk factors for renal impairment and cardiovascular disease, and degree of renal impairment; if needed seek advice from a renal specialist and a clinician with expertise in managing bipolar disorder\n【275】 - Monitor the person at every appointment for symptoms of neurotoxicity, including paraesthesia, ataxia, tremor and cognitive impairment, which can occur at therapeutic levels of lithium\n【276】 - If stopping lithium, reduce the dose gradually over at least 4 weeks, and preferably up to 3 months, even if the person has started taking another antimanic drug\n【277】 - During dose reduction and for 3 months after lithium treatment is stopped, monitor the person closely for early signs of mania and depression\n【278】 ## Using valproate\n【279】 - December 2022: The MHRA has issued new safety advice on risks associated with valproate for anyone under 55\n【280】 - Advise people taking valproate, and their carers, how to recognise the signs and symptoms of blood and liver disorders and to seek immediate medical help if any of these develop. Stop valproate immediately if abnormal liver function or blood dyscrasia is detected.Although the absolute values of hepatic enzymes are a poor indicator of the extent of hepatic damage, it is generally accepted that if these are persistently elevated to over 3 times the upper normal limit, continuing to rise or accompanied by clinical symptoms, the suspected drug should be withdrawn. Raised hepatic enzymes of any magnitude accompanied by reduced albumin or impaired clotting suggest severe liver disease\n【281】 - When prescribing valproate, be aware of its interactions with other anticonvulsants (particularly carbamazepine and lamotrigine) and with olanzapine and smoking\n【282】 - Do not routinely measure plasma valproate levels unless there is evidence of ineffectiveness, poor adherence or toxicity\n【283】 - Measure the person's weight or BMI and carry out liver function tests and a full blood count again after 6 months of treatment with valproate and repeat annually\n【284】 - Monitor sedation, tremor and gait disturbance carefully in older people\n【285】 - If stopping valproate, reduce the dose gradually over at least 4 weeks to minimise the risk of relapse\n【286】 ## Using lamotrigine\n【287】 - When starting lamotrigine:\n【288】 - carry out a full blood count, urea and electrolytes and liver function tests\n【289】 - be aware of its interaction with valproate\n【290】 - follow the instructions for initial dosage and dosage titration outlined in the SPC and BNF, taking into account the need for slow titration in people who have not taken lamotrigine before\n【291】 - Advise people taking lamotrigine to:\n【292】 - contact their doctor immediately if they develop a rash while the dose of lamotrigine is being increased\n【293】 - tell you if they are pregnant or planning a pregnancy\n【294】 - Do not routinely measure plasma lamotrigine levels unless there is evidence of ineffectiveness, poor adherence or toxicity\n【295】 - If stopping lamotrigine, reduce the dose gradually over at least 4 weeks to minimise the risk of relapse\n【296】 # Recognising, diagnosing and managing bipolar disorder in children and young people\n【297】 ## Recognition and referral\n【298】 - Do not use questionnaires in primary care to identify bipolar disorder in children or young people\n【299】 - If bipolar disorder is suspected in primary care in children or young people aged under 14 years, refer them to child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS)\n【300】 - If bipolar disorder is suspected in primary care in young people aged 14 years or over, refer them to a specialist early intervention in psychosis service or a CAMHS team with expertise in the assessment and management of bipolar disorder in line with the recommendations in this guideline. The service should be multidisciplinary and have:\n【301】 - engagement or assertive outreach approaches\n【302】 - family involvement and family intervention\n【303】 - access to structured psychological interventions and psychologically informed care\n【304】 - vocational and educational interventions\n【305】 - access to pharmacological interventions\n【306】 - professionals who are trained and competent in working with young people with bipolar disorder\n【307】 - Diagnosis of bipolar disorder in children or young people should be made only after a period of intensive, prospective longitudinal monitoring by a healthcare professional or multidisciplinary team trained and experienced in the assessment, diagnosis and management of bipolar disorder in children and young people, and in collaboration with the child or young person's parents or carers\n【308】 - When diagnosing bipolar disorder in children or young people take account of the following:\n【309】 - mania must be present\n【310】 - euphoria must be present on most days and for most of the time, for at least 7 days\n【311】 - irritability is not a core diagnostic criterion\n【312】 - Do not make a diagnosis of bipolar disorder in children or young people on the basis of depression with a family history of bipolar disorder but follow them up\n【313】 - When assessing suspected bipolar disorder in children or young people, follow recommendations 1.3.2 to 1.3.4 for adults, but involve parents or carers routinely and take into account the child or young person's educational and social functioning\n【314】 ## Management in young people\n【315】 - When offering treatment to young people with bipolar disorder, take into account their cognitive ability, emotional maturity, developmental level, their capacity to consent to treatment, the severity of their bipolar disorder and risk of suicide or self‑harm or any other risk outlined in recommendation 1.3.5\n【316】 - December 2022: The MHRA has issued new safety advice on risks associated with valproate for anyone under 55\n【317】 - Offer a structured psychological intervention (individual cognitive behavioural therapy or interpersonal therapy) to young people with bipolar depression. The intervention should be of at least 3 months' duration and have a published evidence-based manual describing how it should be delivered\n【318】 - If after 4 to 6 weeks there is no or a limited response to cognitive behavioural therapy or interpersonal therapy, carry out a multidisciplinary review and consider an alternative individual or family psychological intervention\n【319】 - If there is a risk of suicide or self‑harm or any other risk outlined in recommendation 1.3.5, carry out an urgent review and develop a risk management plan as outlined in recommendation 1.4.1\n【320】 - After the multidisciplinary review, if there are coexisting factors such as comorbid conditions, persisting psychosocial risk factors such as family discord, or parental mental ill‑health, consider:\n【321】 - an alternative psychological intervention for bipolar depression for the young person, their parents or other family member or\n【322】 - an additional psychological intervention for any coexisting mental health problems in line with relevant NICE guidance for the young person, their parents or other family member\n【323】 - After the multidisciplinary review, consider a structured individual or family psychological intervention for managing bipolar disorder in young people in the longer term\n【324】 # Terms used in this guideline\n【325】 ## Carer\n【326】 - A person who provides unpaid support to a partner, family member, friend or neighbour who is ill, struggling or disabled\n【327】 ## Children\n【328】 - People aged 12 years and under\n【329】 ## Depression\n【330】 - The severity of bipolar depression is defined in line with NICE's clinical guideline on depression as follows:\n【331】 - Mild depression Few, if any, symptoms in excess of the 5 required to make the diagnosis, with symptoms resulting in minor functional impairment\n【332】 - Moderate depression Symptoms or functional impairment that are between mild and severe\n【333】 - Severe depression Most symptoms, with symptoms markedly interfering with functioning. Can occur with or without psychotic symptoms\n【334】 ## Evidence‑based manual\n【335】 - A manual based on at least 1 randomised controlled trial published in a peer‑reviewed journal showing effectiveness of the intervention in reducing depression symptoms in bipolar depression or, when used as long‑term treatment, reducing relapse in people with bipolar disorder\n【336】 ## Older people\n【337】 - People aged 65 years and over\n【338】 ## Young people\n【339】 - People aged 13 to 17 years\n【340】 ## Valproate\n【341】 - The Guideline Development Group has made the following recommendations for research, based on its review of evidence, to improve NICE guidance and patient care in the future. The Guideline Development Group's full set of research recommendations is detailed in the full guideline\n【342】 # Maintenance treatment\n【343】 - In the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder, what is the relative effect on quality of life of lithium, an antipsychotic (haloperidol, olanzapine, quetiapine or risperidone), or a combination of lithium and an antipsychotic?\n【344】 ## Why this is important\n【345】 - Lithium and antipsychotic medication are known to reduce the risk of relapse when used long‑term in people with bipolar disorder. Relapses do still occur and the response is usually to add another mood‑stabilising drug. However, lithium and antipsychotics are associated with a number of side effects, some of which can adversely affect physical health. The relative effects of lithium, an antipsychotic or a combination of these drugs, regarding efficacy, tolerability, cost effectiveness and quality of life, are unknown. Such information is important to people with bipolar disorder to help them make an informed choice about the treatment options available to them, and to the NHS to inform the best use of resources\n【346】 - The suggested programme of research should involve a pragmatic 3‑arm RCT comparing lithium monotherapy with antipsychotic monotherapy (haloperidol, olanzapine, quetiapine or risperidone) and a combination of lithium and an antipsychotic. The study should last at least 1 year with the primary outcome being quality of life. Symptom control, relapse, function and economic outcomes should also be measured", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": "缺少换行#11#11#Recommendations", "type3": "无关文本#273#273#For further information see NICE’s guidelines on chronic kidney disease and acute kidney injury", "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-15 17:51:30", "update_time": "2024-04-15 23:32:51"}

It is performed as part of a physical examination, or when a patient presents with leg pain suggestive of a cardiovascular pathology\n【3】 - The exam includes several parts:\n【4】 - Position/Lighting/Draping\n【5】 - Inspection\n【6】 - Palpation\n【7】 - Auscultation\n【8】 - Special maneuvers\n【9】 # Position/Lighting/Draping\n【10】 - Position - patient should be lying in the supine position and the bed or examination should be flat. The patient's hands should remain at her sides with her head resting on a pillow\n【11】 - Lighting - adjusted so that it is ideal\n【12】 - Draping - the legs should be exposed, the private groin and thigh covered.  Drapes are usually placed between the legs\n【13】 # Inspection\n【14】 - On inspection the physician looks for signs of:\n【15】 - trauma\n【16】 - previous surgery (scars)\n【17】 - muscle wasting/muscle asymmetry\n【18】 - edema (swelling)\n【19】 - erythema (redness)\n【20】 - ulcers - arterial ulcers tend to be on the borders / sides of the foot, neuropathic ulcers on the plantar surface of the foot, venous ulcers tend on be on the medial aspect of the leg superior to the medial malleolus\n【21】 - hair - hair is absent in peripheral vascular disease (PVD)\n【22】 - shiny skin - seen in PVD\n【23】 # Palpation\n【24】 - Temperature - cool suggest poor circulation, sides should be compared\n【25】 - Pitting edema - should be tested for in dependent locations - dorsum of foot, if present then on the shins.  If the patient has been in bed for a longer period of time one should check the sacrum\n【26】 - Capillary refill (should be less than 3 seconds)(the time it takes to say capillary return)\n【27】 ## Arterial pulses\n【28】 - Dorsalis pedis artery pulse - on dorsal surface of the foot, running lateral to the tendon of the first toe\n【29】 - Posterior tibial artery pulse - posterior and inferior to the medial malleolus\n【30】 - Popliteal artery pulse - behind the knee, typically done with both hands\n【31】 - Femoral artery pulse - in the femoral triangle / halfway between the ASIS and pubic symphisis\n【32】 # Auscultation\n【33】 - for femoral artery bruits\n【34】 # Special maneuvers\n【35】 - Ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI) assesses peripheral vascular disease\n【36】 - Venous refill with dependency (should be less than 30 seconds) - the vein should bulge outward with in 30 seconds of elevation for one minute\n【37】 - Buerger's test (assessment of arterial sufficiency):\n【38】 - With the patient supine, note the colour of the feet soles. They should be pink. Then elevate both legs to 45 degrees for more   than 1 minute. Observe the soles. If there is marked pallor ,whiteness, ischemia should be suspected. Next check for rubor on dependency. Sit the patient upright and observe the feet. In normal patients, the feet quickly turn pink. If, more slowly, they turn red like a cooked lobster, suspect ischemia\n【39】 - Brodie-Trendelenburg test (assessment of valvular competence if varicose veins are present):\n【40】 - One leg at a time. With the patient supine, empty the superficial veins by 'milking' the leg in the distal to proximal direction.  Now press with your thumb over the saphenofemoral junction (2cm below and 2cm lateral to the pubic tubercle) and ask the patient to stand while you maintain pressure. If the leg veins now refill rapidly, the incompetence is located below the saphenofemoral junction, and visa versa. This test can be repeated using pressure at any point along the leg until the incompetence has been mapped out\n【41】 # The Femoral Region\n【42】 - As with examination of any other area of the body, exposure is key. Socks, stockings, pants and skirts should all be removed\n【43】 - Begin by simply looking at the area in question, which is on either side of the crease separating the leg from the groin region. Make note of any discrete swellings, which might represent adenopathy or a femoral hernia\n【44】 - Palpate the area, feeling carefully for the femoral pulses as well as for inguinal/femoral adenopathy (nodes which surround the femoral artery and vein\\ up to one cm in size are considered non-pathologic). If you feel any lymph nodes, note if they are firm or soft, fixed in position or freely mobile (fixed, firm nodes are more worrisome for pathologic states)\n【45】 - The femoral pulse should be easily identifiable, located along the crease midway between the pubic bone and the anterior iliac crest. Use the tips of your 2nd, 3rd and 4th fingers. If there is a lot of subcutaneous fat, you will need to push firmly\n【46】 - A femoral hernia, if present, is located on the anterior thigh, medial to the femoral artery. As it can be transient (i.e. the patient reports its presence yet you find nothing on examination), investigation should include observation as well as palpation while the patient performs a valsalva maneuver, which may make a hernia more prominent\n【47】 - Localization of femoral artery\n【48】 - Palpation of femoral artery\n【49】 # The Popliteal Region\n【50】 - Move down to the level of the knee allowing it to remain slightly bent\n【51】 - Place your hands around the knee and push the tips of your fingers into the popliteal fossa in an effort to feel the popliteal pulse. Note whether it feels simply pulsatile (normal) or enlarged and aneurysmal (uncommon). This artery is covered by a lot of tissue and can be difficult to identify, so you may need to push pretty hard. Even then, it may not be palpable, which is not clinically important if you can still identify the more distal pulses\n【52】 - Palpation of popliteal artery\n【53】 # Below The Knee\n【54】 - Now, turn your attention to the lower leg (i.e. from the knee to the foot). First, examine with your eyes, paying attention to:\n【55】 - Color: Venous insufficiency is characterized by a dark bluish/purple discoloration. Over time, long standing stasis of blood leads to the deposition of hemosiderin, giving the skin a dark, speckled appearance. If the leg is placed in a dependent position, the bluish/purple discoloration may darken dramatically, further suggestive of venous insufficiency. This occurs as a result of gravity working against an already ineffective blood return system. Patients with severe arterial insufficiency, on the other hand, may have relatively pale skin as a result of under perfusion. When their legs are placed in a dependent position, gravity enhances arterial inflow and the skin may become more red as maximally dilated arterioles attempt to bring blood to otherwise starved tissues. In cases of severe ischemia, the affected areas (usually involving the most distal aspect of the foot), can appear whitish or mottled, giving the leg a marbleized appearance. Dead tissue turns black (a.k.a. gangrene). Cellulitis (infection in the skin) will cause the skin to appear bright red. These changes can be difficult to detect in people of color\n【56】 - Obvious swelling of the leg: If present, is it symmetric? To what level does the swelling exist (i.e. ankle, calf, knee etc.)?\n【57】 - Nail growth: Nail thickening and deformity often occurs with arterial insufficiency; also with fungal infections\n【58】 - Skin: Any obvious growths? Shiny, hairless appearance ? Dilated or varicose superficial veins? Ulceration of the skin can occur in the setting of either venous or arterial disease\n【59】 - The bottom of the foot and between the toes: These are common \"problem areas,\" particularly in patients with diabetes who are predisposed as a result of sensory impairment, arterial insufficiency, or both\n【60】 # The Distal Pulses\n【61】 - If there is a lot of edema, you will have to push your way through the fluid-filled tissue to get down to the level of the artery\n【62】 - If you are unable to palpate a pulse, find a doppler machine, which should be present on any inpatient floor or ER, and use it to identify the location of the artery. Mark the place with a pen and then go back and again try to feel it with your fingers. In this way, you will be able to determine if the vessel was not palpable on the basis of limited blood flow or if you are simply having a \"technical\" problem\n【63】 - Pulses are rated on a scale ranging from 0 (not palpable) to 2+ (normal). As with edema, this is very subjective and it will take you a while to develop a sense of relative values. In the event that the pulse is not palpable, the doppler signal generated is also rated, ranging again from 0 to 2+\n【64】 # The Posterior Tibial( PT) Artery\n【65】 - Located just behind the medial malleolous. It can be palpated by scooping the patient's heel in your hand and wrapping your fingers around so that the tips come to rest on the appropriate area. Alternatively, you can reach your fingers over the top of the medial malleolous and approach the artery from this direction. In either case, you are attempting to locate the artery using the tips of your fingers. Pitfalls mentioned with the DP also apply here\n【66】 - Localization of posterior tibial artery\n【67】 - Forceps grasping posterior tibial artery\n【68】 - Examination of posterior tibial artery\n【69】 - Doppler USG: Examination of posterior tibial artery\n【70】 # The Dorsalis Pedis( DP) Artery\n【71】 - Located just lateral to the extensor tendon of the big toe, which can be identified by asking the patient to flex their toe while you provide resistance to this movement. Gently place the tips of your 2nd, 3rd and 4th fingers adjacent to the tendon and try to feel the pulse. If you can't feel it, try moving your hand either proximally/distally or more laterally and repeat. Common pitfalls include pushing too hard and/or mistaking your own pulse for that of the patient. Palpating the patients radial artery or your own carotid simultaneously with your free hand can help sort this out\n【72】 - Location of the dorsalis pedis artery in relation to surrounding structures (surface anatomy)\n【73】 - Location of the dorsalis pedis artery in relation to surrounding structures (gross anatomy)\n【74】 - Palpation of the dorsalis pedis artery\n【75】 # Possible Examination Findings\n【76】 - Acute Arterial Insufficiency: Note Mottled Appearance of Skin\n【77】 - Chronic Arterial Insufficiency with Ulcers\n【78】 - Gangrene of Toes\n【79】 - Venous insufficiency\n【80】 - Cellulitis\n【81】 - Assymetric Leg, Swelling secondary to Deep Venous Thrombosis in Right Leg\n【82】 - Onychomycosis\n【83】 - Neuropathic Ulcer in Patient with Diabetic neuropathy\n【84】 - Venous Stasis Ulcer\n【85】 - Edema of Right Foot\n【86】 - Clinical Osteomyelitis: Deep ulcer which permits passage of Q-tip to underlying level of bone\n【87】 - Massive edema\n【88】 - Lymphedema", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-15 17:51:30", "update_time": "2024-04-15 21:15:53"}

It ranges throughout the eastern United States, southward to Florida and westward to Minnesota.  Prefers rich soil in upland woods.  On the mountains of North Carolina and Tennessee it reaches its greatest size.  Roots are fibrous.  The leaves somewhat resemble those of the pear, but are finer and more delicate, covered with a soft, silken down as they come from the bud but becoming smooth at maturity.  The flowers are in loose racemes at the ends of the branches\n【4】 - Bark: Pale red brown, divided into narrow ridges the surface of which is scaly.  Branchlets bright green, later become dark brown or purplish brown, smooth\n【5】 - Wood: Dark brown, sometimes tinged with red; heavy, hard, close-grained and strong.  Sp. gr., 0.7838; weight of cu. ft., 48.85 lbs\n【6】 - Winter buds: Chestnut brown, acute, one-fourth of an inch long.  Inner scales enlarge with the growing shoot and are sometimes an inch long before they fall\n【7】 - Leaves: Alternate, simple, ovate to ovate-oblong, three to four inches long, one and a half to two inches broad, cordate or rounded at base, serrate, acute or acuminate.  Feather-veined, midrib grooved above, prominent beneath.  They come out of the bud conduplicate, reddish brown and hairy, when full grown are smooth, deep green above, paler beneath.  In autumn they turn a bright yellow.  Petioles are slender, grooved.  Stipules lanceolate, downy, early deciduous\n【8】 - Flowers: April, when leaves are about one-third grown.  Perfect, white, borne in racemes from three to five inches long.  Each flower has a slender pedicel, furnished with two lanceolate, purplish silky bractlets which fall as the flower opens\n【9】 - Calyx: Campanulate, five-lobed; lobes lanceolate, acute, downy, persistent, imbricate in bud\n【10】 - Corolla: Petals five, white, strap-shaped, one-half inch to an inch in length, inserted on the calyx tube, imbricate in bud\n【11】 - Stamens: Twenty, inserted on the calyx tube; filaments persistent in fruit; anthers introrse, two-celled; cells opening longitudinally\n【12】 - Pistil: Ovary two to five-celled, united to calyx tube.  Styles two to five, with broad stigmas; ovules two in each cell.  When mature each cell has been divided by a cartilaginous partition, giving ten cells and one seed in each\n【13】 # Uses\n【14】 - The fruit is delicious and ripens in June.  But there are few berries, the largest trees rarely produce more than a quart, and birds eat most of them.

T. Edwards Tuberculosis Hospitals, the facilities were later remodeled into \"Sunland Centers\" with services for the mentally and physically disabled, specializing mostly in children. A large majority of the centers were shut down by 1983 for various health and safety reasons. Much of the historical information found in this article was compiled from the Florida Archives\n【3】 # W. T. Edwards Tuberculosis Hospital\n【4】 - Though information is vague, Florida archives note W. T. Edwards as an important in state healthcare, donating significant amounts of money to various medical facilities. When a new series of state-of-the-art tuberculosis hospitals opened in roughly 1952, they were named in honor of W. T. Edwards. The hospitals were located all over the state of Florida, including Tampa, Lantana, Marianna, Tallahassee, Miami and several other cities in south Florida\n【5】 - All of the hospital buildings were constructed in the same basic way. The main buildings were all very long and thin, consisting of 5 floors with a few smaller wings branching off from the main building. At the time, it was thought that fresh air was the best treatment for TB, so the buildings were riddled with multi-pane windows which could be opened by cranks. The back side of each building was a wall of windows, while the front windows were more evenly spaced apart, especially in sections that did not house patients\n【6】 - It is also rumored on various fanmade websites, but not confirmed officially, that the deceased TB patients were incinerated in the basement furnaces. This is quite likely, since due to the contagiousness of the disease, bodies were often burned rather than buried. This would give way to stories of hauntings in later years\n【7】 - When the vaccine for TB was discovered, there was no longer a need for tuberculosis hospitals and the W. T. Edwards Hospitals were all closed by the start of the 1960s. The facilities fell under the jurisdiction of the Florida Department of Health and it wouldn't take long for the hospitals to reopen as Sunlands across the state\n【8】 # Sunland Training Centers\n【9】 - In 1961 the Division of Sunland Training Centers was established on the Board of Commissioners for Institutions and replaced the Division of Farm Colonies in Florida. Many former W. T. Edwards Hospitals were remodeled and reopened as Sunland Mental Hospitals. The main Sunland building, located in Orlando, was the only one not housed in a former Edwards hospital. The building in Orlando was only 3 floors, but had many wings. Between 1965-1967, the patients from Orlando were often transported to the various other Sunland Centers when they were ready to accept them\n【10】 - At first the Centers did well, but soon they were plagued with problems, mostly due to understaffing and underfunding. The most infamous facility for patient neglect was the Sunland located in Tallahassee, which not only suffered from severe staff shortages, but also significant deterioration of the physical plant itself, as noted on the now closed website dedicated to researching Sunland;\n【11】 - Many Sunlands had various activities for the patients, who were mostly children, to engage in. There were swimming pools with rails and plastic wheelchairs, hopscotch, shuffleboard and frequent appearances by s like Woodsy Owl and even the state governor himself. Many of the patients were also official Boy Scouts and often held meetings on the hospital grounds with Scoutmasters. Pictures still exist in the Florida archives of children in full uniform posing in their wheelchairs and hospital beds\n【12】 - As the state of the Hospitals declined, they fell under the Department of Children and Families and underwent several name changes until settling on the format of \"Sunland at 'City Name'.\" Eventually, groups like the Association for Retarded Citizens stepped in and began speaking out against institutions like Sunland, which often treated its patients as \"sub-human\", subjecting them to electroconvulsive therapy among other treatments which were coming to be considered cruel\n【13】 # The sun sets on Sunland\n【14】 - As the 1970s came to an end, it soon became obvious that Sunland would not survive. Most of the centers closed down by 1980 and dispersed their patients to foster homes\n【15】 - The original plan was to use the buildings as storage space for the State and many buildings did follow this plan, most notably the location in Tampa, which was alternately in use by area college students as a lab facility until 1992 when that particular building shut down permanently. Earlier this year, the building was fenced off and the windows have been removed. The building seems set to be demolished soon as of November 2006\n【16】 - As of July 2007, nothing remains of the once prestigious hospital in Tampa. Hillsborough Community College is responsible for its destruction. Plans are currently underway by Tampa based art collective Beacon Meadows, in conjunction with several local history organizations, to properly memorialize W.T. Edwards Tuberculosis Hospital of Tampa and all of its rich history\n【17】 - Another location in Lantana did later reopen as the United States' only functioning TB hospital; the A.G. Holley Building, which was originally the Southeastern State Hospital still operates today. Though it was never remodeled into a Sunland, it is the only functional building of that type today. Current plans are to cease operations at this location, however, and destroy the building to make way for a public library\n【18】 - The main building in Orlando was demolished in 1997 after an urban explorer fell down an elevator shaft as documented in this news story. Though the man survived, the building was labeled unsafe and was quickly taken down and paved over with a children's park. Some campus buildings still remain encircling the park to this day. The building in Marianna underwent recent demolition and was part of a Sunland Campus that still operates today, though the old Hospital Building was long-abandoned\n【19】 - The Tallahassee location is scheduled to be demolished within the next year or two (as of 2006) according to reports on a local Tallahassee news website WCTV Channel 6. Aztec Environmental is working on the site at current\n【20】 - The Landmark Learning Center, formerly a Sunland center in Miami that changed its name, closed in 2005\n【21】 - Gulf Coast Center, formerly a Sunland Center, is still in operation in Fort Myers.  It is scheduled to be closed in 2010\n【22】 - Tacachale center in Gainesville, a former Sunland Center, is still in operation today with no plans of closing down\n【23】 - Many of the above listed centers were not housed in the familiar hospital buildings like the locations in Tallahassee and Tampa\n【24】 - The plan that some advocates for the developmentally disabled want is for all large institutions to be closed down and have all developmentally disabled live in their own homes, either homes shared by roommates or in their own apartments in the community.  The State of Florida at this time is not providing enough funding for the non-profit group home/supported living agencies to expand, therefore the disabled wait ten years before they can get their own home.  This is why the Sunland centers are still open, there's simply no other place for the developmentally disabled to wait for placement into their own homes\n【25】 # Sunland at Tallahassee\n【26】 - The most infamous Sunland location is the one located in Tallahassee. It received its first 10 residents from the Orlando Sunland in March 1967. Of particular note, only the Sunland at Tallahassee and Sunland at Orlando locations were actually considered \"hospitals\" due to the fact that they cared for both mentally and physically disabled patients while all other centers cared for mentally disabled patients only\n【27】 - Over the years, due to the lack of funds and on-site staff, the patients were often neglected, according to state reports found in the Florida Archives. This led to many ghost stories. While there were some deaths at Sunland, the deceased were not burned in the furnaces (which may have been the case in its days as a TB hospital) nor were they buried on the property, as is popular local legend. They were actually taken by ambulance to the nearby Tallahassee Memorial Hospital's morgue, as Sunland itself had no facilities to properly care for deceased patients\n【28】 - The building, like its sisters, is extremely long and thin and littered with windows. There are 5 floors on the main wing, with the ground floor being partially underground in the front. A small 3-floor wing sticks out on the front west side of the building, housing one of the two reception areas. A larger 4-floor wing in the front-middle of the building houses the kitchen, main reception area, auditorium, pharmacy and dental/examining room locations as well as the administrative offices. There is roof access via the central stair well only. The tops of the elevator towers may also be accessed by ladders on the outside of the towers\n【29】 - Sunland at Tallahassee stood relatively obscure in the middle of a wooded area on Phillips Road, right off of Miccosukee Road, for years. In the early 2000s, an extension to Blair Stone Road cleared the area around Sunland and gained the old abandoned hospital significantly more exposure. It was previously used as additional employee parking by nearby Tallahassee Memorial Hospital, but was abandoned as a parking lot in 1999. As local teens began to frequent the building, it became necessary to erect a fence around it, which did nothing to keep curious explorers out, even with police patrolling the area. People from neighboring states also began to travel to visit the infamous Sunland at Tallahassee\n【30】 - In reality, there was nothing much left of the old Hospital. Besides a few rusty cribs and beds and very little office furniture, the building was all but gutted and destroyed by vandals over the years before it became more heavily exposed. The state of Florida desperately wanted to be rid of the old eyesore, but due to the cost of asbestos abatement and lead paint removal, finding a buyer who would foot those bills plus the 3.5 million dollar price tag (noted on several news reports in the Tallahassee Democrat) on the property, was nearly impossible\n【31】 - It was almost purchased in 2004 by a Winter Park businessman, but that deal fell through. In December 2005, the property was finally bought and the buyer promised to have the building demolished by the end of 2006. Aztec Environmental quickly set up shop and as of June 2006, the building is being sealed in order to proceed with the daunting task of asbestos abatement for the 189,000 square foot building. Its neighboring campus buildings have already been destroyed\n【32】 - The current plan is to erect a series of office buildings and commercial fronts called \"Mandalay Square\" which would stand on the site where the current Sunland building and it's now-demolished sister buildings are. A separate park of residential units are planned to be built in the heavily wooded area behind the Sunland building, which will be called \"Mandalay Bay\" according to large signs along the roadside of the property\n【33】 , work began on demolishing the old 5-story hospital building, beginning with the east end facing Blair Stone Road. The north facade was knocked out on the first three floors and a crane has been used to claw at the building, taking it down little by little. According to the coordinator of the demolition, the building is \"not cooperating\" and it may take more than a month to complete the process of taking it down and hauling the debris away. Estimates are that it will take 700 dumptrucks to remove the remains of the building, cited in news reports from the Tallahassee Democrat\n【34】 Sunland Hospital was half way demolished\n【35】 only the elevator shaft remains\n【36】 the elevator tower was finally demolished, effectively reducing the entire building to rubble. Dump trucks continue taking loads of the debris away daily\n【37】 - By the conclusion of the 2006 year, all traces of Sunland at Tallahassee have been removed. Only a shelf of dirt remains where the building's underground section was located\n【38】 - In early 2007-present day work began prepping the old Sunland site for construction. The densely wooded area behind the building has been cleared and several ditches have been dug and filled with rocks. Large stone walls are also being erected and sod has been laid in several places over the property. Several dozens of pallets of stones, lumber and drainage tubing are all on site and the area has been fenced in. The small area across the street where the garage once stood is also fenced in and contains the construction foreman's trailer. No signs of the Sunland campus remain\n【39】 # A.G. Holley Hospital in Lantana\n【40】 - A. G. Holley State Hospital (AGH) was opened in 1950 as the Southeast Tuberculosis Hospital.  It was originally built to serve 500 patients, with living accommodations for the physicians, nurses and administrative staff.  It was the second of four state tuberculosis hospitals built in Florida between 1938 and 1952. The other hospitals have since closed.  A. G. Holley is the last of the original American sanatoriums that continues to be dedicated to tuberculosis\n【41】 - With the discovery of drugs to treat tuberculosis patients outside of the hospital setting, the daily census at the hospital by 1971 dropped to less than half of the original 500.  By 1976 the beds and staff at A.G. Holley were reduced to serve a maximum of 150 patients.  As space became available, other agencies were invited to move onto the complex to utilize the unique environment\n【42】 - As the incidence of TB declined, so did the number of beds.  Although the hospital is currently licensed for 100 beds, it is only funded for 50.  As the rate of tuberculosis continued to decline, the hospital was faced with closure\n【43】 - Tuberculosis in the United States and especially in Florida began to increase in the mid '80s.  This was due to the emergence of HIV, an increase in homelessness, drug addiction, immigration from areas of high tuberculosis, the spread in institutional settings, and the spread of drug-resistant tuberculosis\n【44】 # Rumors and hauntings\n【45】 - There were many stories of paranormal encounters experienced while in and around the Sunland Building, particularly the one in Tallahassee. Claims of unexplained lights and sounds abound. Stories ranged from simple disembodied footsteps to rusty beds moving on their own to block people inside a particular room. There was also a very well-known story of the sound of a child jumping rope on the floor above where a person was. Toys left in the building were said to have been moved or played with, but due to the heavy stream of people visiting the building, it's impossible to say if this was paranormal or the meddling of another group of people coming through. Another claim that patients were horribly mistreated and abused is also popular, but unfounded\n【46】 - Some stories get confused, such as the rumor that the third floor is locked. This was true of the Sunland in Orlando, but not of the one in Tallahassee, as per accounts of those who had entered the buildings, as is often mistaken by urban explorers. Some doors were in fact locked at the Tampa location. These doors were easily bypassed by ascending the stairs on one side of the door and descending the stairs on the opposite side\n【47】 - Ghost hunters who had visited the Tallahassee building claimed it was full of paranormal activity and cited the constant appearance of \"orbs\" in their photographs as proof of this. While some photos may be indicative of some sort of unseen force, much of this could be explained away as dust or humidity playing games with the camera lens, as all the buildings were moist and dusty\n【48】 - Other rumors persisted for years that Sunland at Tallahassee had at least one or more sub-basements that were supposedly flooded and inaccessible. These rumors were all proven false when the building was demolished, as the foundation was dug up, revealing nothing beneath it", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": "多余换行#32#33#属于同段内容\n多余换行#34#36#属于同段内容", "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-15 17:51:30", "update_time": "2024-04-15 19:53:47"}

Most of the women are asymptomatic, when present, symptoms may include, pain in the abdomen or pelvic area, bloating or swelling of the abdomen, quickly feeling full when eating, other digestive problems. An elevated concentration of CA-125 in serum is seen in some patients of ovarian sarcoma. Biopsy is the study of choice. Findings on MRI suggestive of ovarian sarcoma include the following. Surgery is the mainstay of treatment for ovarian sarcoma.Among all chemotherapeutic regimens that are being used to treat ovarian sarcoma, they are divided into two groups like platinum containing regimens and non-platinum regimens.

The National Institute for O ccu p atio n al S afety and H ealth (NIOSH) evaluates all available research data and criteria and recommends standards for occupational exposure. The Secretary of Labor will w eigh th e se reco m m en d atio n s along with other considerations, such as feasibility and means of implementation, in promulgating regulatory standards.

The standard is designed to p ro te c t the h e a lth and provide for th e s a fe ty of employees for up to a 10-hour workshift, 40-hour workweek, over a working lifetime. Compliance with all sections of the recommended standard should prevent adverse effects of diisocyanates on the h e a lth of u n sen sitized workers and provide for their safety. Sufficient technology ex ists to p erm it co m p lian ce w ith th e reco m m en d ed standard. Although NIOSH considers th e w orkplace e n v iro n m en ta l lim its to be safe levels based on current in fo rm atio n , th e em ployer should regard them as the upper boundaries of exposure and m ake every effort to keep the exposure as low as possible. The recommended standard will be reviewed and revised as necessary.

INTRODUCTION\n【94】 - This re p o rt presents the criteria and the recommended standard based thereon th a t w ere p re p a re d to m e e t the need for preventing impairment of health arising from o ccu p a tio n a l exposure to d iiso c y an ate s. The criteria document fulfills the responsib ility of th e S e c re ta ry of H ealth , Education, and Welfare under (a) of th e O ccu p atio n al S afety and H ealth Act of 1970 to \"develop criteria dealing w ith toxic materials and harmful physical agents and substances which will d e sc rib e \\.e x p o su re levels a t w hich no em p lo y ee will su ffe r im paired health or f u n c ti o n a l c a p a c i t i e s or dim inished life e x p e c ta n c y as a re s u lt of his work experience.\"\n【95】 - A fter review ing d a ta and consulting with others, NIOSH formalized a system for th e d ev elo p m en t of c r ite r ia on which standards can be established to protect th e h e a lth and to provide for th e s a fe ty of em p lo y ees exposed to hazardous chem ical and physical agents. C riteria for a recommended standard should enable m a n ag em en t and labor to develop b e tte r en g in eerin g controls resulting in more h e a lth fu l work environments, and simply complying with the recommended standard should not be regarded as the final goal. O ccu p atio n al exp o su re to som e of the diisocyanates has produced respiratory illness in w orkers\n【96】 - In addition to irritating the upper and lower respiratory tract, diisocyanates can cause sensitization, and sensitized individuals may develop asthma upon exposure to d iiso c y an ate s in very sm all am o u n ts. Chronic impairment of pulm onary fu n ctio n has b een re p o rte d in some workers exposed to diisocyanates. Diisocyanates are also irritating to the skin and eyes. F u rth e r re se a rc h is need ed in a num ber of a re a s re le v a n t to co n tro llin g occupational exposure to diisocyanates. The possibilities of carcinogenic, mutagenic, te ra to g e n ic , and reproductive effects from diisocyanates have not been adequately in v e stig a te d\n【97】 - Studies in w hich e f f e c ts on individuals a re correlated with their a c tu a l exposures are also needed. Screening tests should be developed to permit e arly reco g n itio n of adverse respiratory effects resulting from sensitization to the d ii s o c y a n a te s\n【98】 - A n im a l e x p e rim e n ts should be p e rfo rm e d to d e te rm in e how c o n c e n tra tio n and len g th of exposure a f f e c t th e d ev elo p m en t of sensitization. Im proved en g ineering co n tro ls should be developed to protect workers in certain diisocyanate applications, such as spraying\n【99】 # III. BIOLOGIC EFFECTS OF EXPOSURE\n【100】 - The d iiso c y an ate s are ch em ical compounds in which two isocyanate groups, -NCO, are a tta c h e d to carb o n ato m s of an org an ic ra d ic a l. The chemical and p h y sic a l p ro p e rtie s of various d iiso c y an ate s a re liste d in XI\n【101】 1  . Synonyms for these compounds are listed in XI-2\n【102】 - Many d iiso cy an ates exhibit high chemical reactivity . In the presence of w a te r they r e a c t exothermically to produce an unscarbamic acid that rapidly d isso cia tes to form a p rim ary amine and carbon dioxide. The primary amine can react further with excess isocyanate to form a urea derivative\n【103】 - Iso cy an ates also r e a c t vigorously with organic compounds containing reactive hydrogens, esp ecially where the hydrogen atom is attached to oxygen, nitrogen, or sulfur\n【104】 - In biologic m acrornolecules, these groups occur abundantly, and the iso cy an a tes will th e re fo re r e a c t and com bine w ith a v a rie ty of sites on these m olecules\n【105】 - Polyfunctional isocyanates, such as the diisocyanates, can act as crosslinking agents with biologic macromolecules\n【106】 # Extent of Exposure\n【107】 - The m ost com m on method of synthesis of the diisocyanates is the reaction of p rim ary am ines w ith phosgene\n【108】 - In th is p ro cess, a p rim ary a lip h a tic or a ro m a tic am ine, dissolved in a so lv en t such as xylene, m onochlorobenzene, or dich lo ro b en zen e, is mixed with phosgene dissolved in the same solvent and allowed to re a c t for sev eral hours a t te m p e ra tu re s of ab o u t 200 C. More phosgene is added during the process, and the final reaction mixture is fractionated to recover th e iso cy an a te p ro d u ct, as w ell as h y d ro ch lo ric acid , u n re a c te d phosgene, the solvent for recycling, and the distillation residue for incineration\n【109】 - Diisocyanates are used to produce polyurethane foams, coatings, elastomers, and spandex fib ers. Toluene d iiso c y an ate (TDI), w hich is co m m ercially available as stan d ard m ix tu res of th e 2,4-and 2 ,6 -iso m ers, is g en erally used in producing flexible p o ly u reth an e fo am s. Methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI), especially in p a rtia lly polym erized forms, is used more frequently in rigid foams. A substantial am ount of MDI (40-50% of th e am o u n t produced) is used in the manufacture of p o ly u r e t h a n e s y s te m s , such as fo rm u la te d p ack ag es of iso c y a n a te s, polyols, flu o ro carb o n blowing a g e n ts, fire retardants, surfactants, and catalysts. TDI and pure MDI, or sp ecial liquid MDI products, are used to make elastomers, which are used in m a n u fa ctu rin g p rin tin g rolls, liners for m ine c h u te s and grain elevator ch u tes, c o a te d fab ric s, shoe soles, and automobile bumpers . MDI is also used in th e foundry in d u stry as part of a binding system for casting molds . The total consumption of MDI and partially polymerized MDI in 1975 was about 300 m illion pounds. TDI consumption totaled about 400 million pounds, and only a few million pounds of other diisocyanates were used in 1975 , W orkers w ith potential occupational exposure to diisocyanates include adhesive w orkers, insulation w orkers, d iiso c y an ate resin workers, lacquer workers, organic c h e m ic a l s y n th e s iz e r s , p ain t sp ray ers, p o ly u reth an e m a k ers, rubber w orkers, shipbuilders, textile processors, and wire-coating workers\n【110】 - A NIOSH s u r v e y co n d u cted in 1972-1974 e s tim a te d th a t 50,000-100,000 em plo y ees in th e U n ited S ta te s w ere p o te n tia lly exposed to diisocyanates. This n u m b e r does not include o ccasio n al users of iso c y a n a te p re p a ra tio n s such as p o ly u reth an e varnish and m ay th e re fo re u n d e re s tim a te th e num ber of workers exposed\n【111】 # Historical Reports\n【112】 - Toluene d iiso c y an ate and h ex am eth y len e d iiso c y an ate (HDI) were the most w id e ly u sed d iis o c y a n a te s in th e early s ta g e s of th e in d u stry , acco rd in g to W illiam son  and Munn\n【113】 - C o n seq u en tly , the earliest reports of hazards from exposure to iso c y a n a te s usually involved th e se compounds. Both of these com pounds a re am ong th e m ore v o la tile diisocyanates, and respiratory and other h ealth problems associated with these compounds prompted the development of less v o la tile di isocyanates and derivatives, as well as improved handling techniques. As a re s u lt, although many new d iiso c y an ate p ro d u cts have been used in industrial applications more recently, the number of reports of toxic effects from exposure to diisocyanates has decreased\n【114】 - In G erm any in 1941, G ross and Hellrung, according to Friebel and Luchtrath  , in v e stig a te d the toxicity of TDI in animal experiments. They exposed dogs, cats, rabbits, and guinea pigs to a commercial TDI preparation at 14-1,400 ppm and re p o rte d th a t, a t the low er c o n c e n tra tio n s stu d ied , irritation of the respiratory tr a c t o c cu rred , and, a t the higher c o n c e n tra tio n s , b ro n ch itis, pneum onia, and pulmonary edema resulted\n【115】 - A ccording to Brugsch and Elkins , toxic effects of TDI had been observed in G erm an w orkers handling th e su b stan ce in w ar-related industries during World War II. However, the first published account of TDI toxicity in humans was a 1951 r e p o r t by Fuchs and Valade  , They d escrib ed nine c ases of p rogressive bronchial ir rita tio n in F ren ch w orkers exposed to TDI. On continued exposure, seven of th e a f f e c te d w orkers developed an a sth m a -lik e co n d itio n , w hich the authors suggested was allergic\n【116】 - In 1953, R einl  reported a human fatality attributed to organoisocyanate exposure. This was 1 of 17 cases of respiratory illness in German workers exposed to TDI or other isocyanates. Thirteen of these illnesses were severe. Two workers developed pulm onary ed em a, w hich in one case was f a ta l, te rm in a tin g in cor pulm onale. In the same year, in Sweden, Swensson et al  described three cases of re s p ira to ry illness in painters who used lacquer containing isocyanates. Two of th e se w orkers had s p iro m e tric pulm onary fu n c tio n m e a su re m e n ts suggestive of emphysema\n【117】 - In the 1950's many similar cases of isocyanate toxicity were reported in Europe , including an o th er f a ta lity  , and in th e United States . T hese o c c u rre d in w orkers exposed to TDI in manufacturing polyurethane foam or using TDI-or p o ly iso c y an ate -b ase d la cq u ers and glues. As many as 99 cases of respiratory illness were reported from a single US plant manufacturing polyurethane foam  . A 1962 review by Elkins et al  reported a total of 222 cases of respiratory illness attributed to TDI exposure in the literature through 1960\n【118】 - G o ld b la tt and Goldblatt , in a 1956 report, described a case of a chemist exposed to th e vapor of h e a te d 1,5-naphthalene diisocyanate (NDI). The chemist developed a sev ere cough th a t recurred each time he returned to the laboratory. G erritsen  suggested in 1955 that an asthm atic condition in workers exposed to HDI was the result of an allergic mechanism\n【119】 - M ost of th e e a r ly r e p o r ts of re s p ira to ry illn ess in w orkers exposed to d iiso c y an ate s described bronchial asthm a or chronic bronchitis, often considered by th e a u t h o r s to involve ev id en ce of se n s itiz a tio n . H ow ever, som e re s p ira to ry illn esses w ere a ttr ib u te d to d ire c t irrita tio n from TDI, usually as a result of acute accidental exposures 35\n【120】 - Friebel and Luchtrath , in 1955, attem pted to dem onstrate sensitization to TDI in guinea pigs. They were not able to produce allergic asthm atic responses in animals exposed to TDI aerosol a t 120 ppm or TDI vapor at 50-80 ppm. Effects on th e anim als' lungs were attributed to primary toxic action by TDI. Zapp , in 1957, also reported only direct effects on the respiratory tra c t in rats, guinea pigs, dogs, and ra b b its exposed to TDI a t 1.5 ppm fo r about 80 exposures of 6 hours each\n【121】 - Since 1960, ad d itio n al cases of occupational illness attributed to exposure to diisocyanates have been reported, but these have been less frequent and less severe as recognition of the hazard has increased. In 1973, NIOSH published criteria for a recom m end ed standard for occupational exposure to TDI . The studies of TDI to x ic ity on which NIOSH based its 1973 reco m m en d atio n s a re discussed in the follow ing s e c tio n s, as is in fo rm a tio n on TDI th a t has appeared in the literature more recently and data on other diisocyanates. Most studies on TDI in this chapter th at are dated prior to 1973 were discussed in the earlier document\n【122】 # Effects on Humans\n【123】 - Much of th e in v e stig a tio n of th e biologic effe c ts of diisocyanates has been d i r e c t e d to w ard d e term in in g th e e x te n t and n a tu re of s e n s itiz a tio n to th e se com pounds. In this document, sensitivity to diisocyanates denotes the tendency of so m e in d iv id u a ls to h a v e a r e s p ira to ry response when th ey a re exposed a t c o n c e n tra tio n s much low er th a n th o se th a t irritate the respiratory tra c t in most p e o p le . S e n s i t i z a t i o n m ay d e v e lo p gradually or suddenly a f te r exposure to diiso c y an ate s\n【124】 - The usual response is an a s th m a tic re a c tio n , c h a ra c te riz e d by w heezing, dyspnea, and bronchial constriction. Use of these term s is not intended to im p lic ate any p a rtic u la r m echanism as the cause of the reaction. The term s \"allergy\" and \"allergic,\" on the other hand, are reserved for conditions in which an immunologic response is implied. W orkers occu p atio n ally exposed to the diisocyanates in various industries have d e v e lo p e d a d v e r s e re s p ira to ry e ff e c ts ; re p o rts of skin d isease and evidence suggesting sy stem ic to x ic ity from such exp o su res have been far less numerous. Most of th e affected workers have been exposed in manufacturing diisocyanates, in using th e se com pounds to manufacture polyurethane products such as foam, and in painting or spraying polyurethane varnishes and paints. These activities also involve possible exposure to o th e r potentially harmful chemicals, including chlorobenzene, phosgene, sty ren e, and am in es, and little is known of how such mixed exposures may affect the toxicity of the diisocyanates\n【125】 - Most of th e d a ta available on exposure to diisocyanates are on TDI. Several reports on MDI and a smaller number on other diisocyantes, including HDI and NDI, have also been published. In the following subsections, information on the biologic effects of TDI is discussed first, followed by data on MDI and other diisocyanates\n【126】 # (a) Respiratory Effects\n【127】 - The odor th resh o ld for TDI estim ated by Zapp  in 1957 was 400 ppb (2.8 m g /c u m) in 12 of 24 m en te s te d\n【128】 - Five y ears la te r , H enschler e t al  e s tim a te d an odor threshold of 50 ppb (360 yg/cu m), using the analytical method of E rlich er and Pilz , which they found was more accurate and sensitive than the R a n ta m ethod used by Zapp. Eye irr ita tio n was experienced by three of six volunteers exposed at this concentration for 10 minutes and five of six exposed for 15 m inutes; one also had nasal irritation . At 100 ppb (700 yg/cu m), two of six com plained of th r o a t ir r ita tio n , and exposure a t 500 ppb  produced eye, nose, and throat irritation in all volunteers\n【129】 - Pulm onary fu n ctio n testing has been used in many studies of workers exposed to TDI and o th e r d iiso c y a n a te s to e v a lu a te changes in lung function. In 1964, seven fu rn itu re p lan t employees who sprayed, dipped, or painted with polyurethane varnish developed acute respiratory symptoms 0.5 hour to 3 weeks after their first known exposure\n【130】 - T h ree m e a su re m e n ts m ade a f te r some improvements in ventilation showed TDI at 80, 100, and 120 ppb (570-850 yg/cu m). All seven men coughed and had difficulty in breathing and four had blood-stained sputum. Five of the seven were tested for forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume a t 1 second (FEV 1) 2-3.5 months after exposure and had higher values than they did shortly after exposure. The responses to a questionnaire given 22 months after exposure after exposure suggested to the author that four of six who responded had become sensitized to TDI\n【131】 - In 1965, W illia m s o n  d e s c r ib e d six w orkers exposed to TDI in a p o ly u reth an e foam p lan t who developed symptoms that were considered suggestive of s e n sitiz a tio n\n【132】 - Four of th e se , from a workforce of 99, had become sensitized during 18 m onths of exposure to TDI a t c o n c e n tra tio n s usually below 20 ppb, ap p are n tly d eterm in e d by a re a m onitoring. The author believed th at sensitization had re su lte d from exposure at higher concentrations caused by spills. Immediately a fte r one spill, TDI at 200 ppb (1.4 mg/cu m) was found, but the concentration was less than 5 ppb (35 y g /c u m) 10 m in u tes la te r\n【133】 - All six a ffe c te d workers had asth m a or b ro n ch itis w ith decreased ventilatory capacity (FVC and FEV 1) during th e se in c id en ts. Some of the subjects were also occasionally exposed to MDI, but always at concentrations below 20 ppb (204 yg/cu m)\n【134】 - In 1976, Charles et al  described a case of pneumonitis and three cases of chronic re s p ira to ry d isease in w orkers exposed to TDI or HDI. Pneumonitis was diagnosed in a 5 0 -y ear-o ld nonsmoker who had experienced difficulty in breathing, weight loss, and fever for 6 weeks at the time of examination. Prior to his 5 years of working in th e p o ly u reth an e foam in d u stry , he had been a coal miner for 11 years. C h est X -rays showed alveolar filling lesions in both the lungs. Two months la te r , pulm onary fu n c tio n te s ts showed reduced FEV 1, vital capacity, total lung c a p a c ity , and residual volum e of the lungs\n【135】 - A bronchogram showed peripheral cy stic bronchiectasis in the right upper lobe. All immunologic tests for antibodies against TDI were negative. Microscopic examination of biopsy samples of lung tissue showed variations from normal architecture ranging from diffuse interstitial disease to a c u te in flam m atio n and end-stage interstitial fibrosis. The authors stated that the a re a s of filled alveoli resembled desquamative interstitial pneumonitis and that the w hole p ic tu re resem b led th a t of a pulmonary hypersensitivity response to an in h a le d a l le r g e n r a t h e r th a n c o a l-m in e rs' pneum oconiosis, but th ey did not demonstrate that this was related to TDI exposure\n【136】 - Two o th er w orkers developed sev ere dyspnea after exposure to spills of TDI\n【137】 - Two to th r e e years after exposure, both workers had moderate obstruction of the airw ays, as in d ic a te d by FEV 1 measurements below predicted values; one also had a decreased vital capacity, and the other, although his vital capacity was normal, still experienced severe nonwheezing dyspnea after minimal exertion\n【138】 - Sim ilar symptoms occurred in a 61-year-old man who had been a paint sprayer for 43 y ears with no previous history of respiratory illness; he developed wheezing, d y s p n e a , an d sw eatin g w ithin hours when he f ir s t used a p o ly u reth an e paint co n tain in g HDI\n【139】 - Whenever he was reexposed to the paint by casual contact w ith fum es from other spraying operations, he again developed symptoms. Testing 1 year a f te r exposure showed moderate obstruction of airways, and he complained of nonwheezing dyspnea after exertion. Pepys e t al  te s te d fo u r p a tie n ts w ith o ccu p a tio n a l a s th m a fo r TDI sen sitiv ity by simulating occupational exposures to a two-stage polyurethane varnish w ith TDI activ ato r. The subjects applied varnish with the TDI activator and, on a se p a ra te day, w ith o u t th e a c tiv a to r , to a surface in a small cubicle. When the a c tiv a to r was used, TDI concentrations in the air reached a maximum of almost 2 ppb (14 y g /c u m), as measured by the colorimetric method of Meddle et al . No TDI was d e te c te d when th e varnish alone was applied. All the subjects were e sse n tia lly a sy m p to m a tic a t the time of testing, and their FVC and FEV 1 values w ere not m ore than 10% below predicted values. None showed positive responses in skin te s ts with common allergens, and none had a family or personal history of allergies\n【140】 - A 26-year-old boatbuilder, who had been using a two-stage polyurethane varnish system for 8 years, had cough and dyspnea at night , The attacks gradually b eca m e more severe and occurred earlier in the day, appearing only when the twos ta g e varnish was used. A nother man, 46 years old, had worked for 8 years as a m a in te n a n c e en g in eer whose d u ties included maintenance of a polyurethane foam m achine. He had chest tightness and shortness of breath, which disappeared within 20 m inu tes a f te r he le ft w ork. His sym ptom s also b eca m e progressively worse, developing into sev ere asth m a. Neither man had any known exposure to spills of TDI. In challenge testing, both reacted to the varnish only when the TDI activator was added. The boatbuilder developed a late asthm atic reaction that appeared at 1-2 hours and re a c h e d a m axim um a t 3-4 hours, while the maintenance engineer showed an immediate reaction\n【141】 - T h e o th er tw o su b je c ts w ere w om en who w orked in a te le v isio n fa c to ry d e p a rtm e n t w here co a te d wires were soldered . The wire, coated with cured p o ly u r e t h a n e an d po ly v in y l b u ty ra l, w as dipped into a resin flux co n taining dim ethylam ine hydrochloride and then into multicore solder at 460 C. One woman, 44 y ears old, developed a chronic cough and, after 6 years, wheezing. The second w om an, a 5 4 -y ear-o ld sup erv iso r in the same departm ent, developed a productive cough, wheezing, and breathlessness, developing into severe bronchitis that kept her away from work for 5 weeks. Her symptoms recurred within 1 week of her return, and this p a tte r n was re p e a te d eac h tim e she attem pted to return to work. Both w o m en r e a c te d to th e varn ish w ith TDI a c tiv a to r\n【142】 - The fir s t woman had an im m e d ia te re a c tio n th a t was reso lv ed in 2 hours but was follow ed by a la te re a c tio n a t 3-4 hours\n【143】 - The second woman had only a late reaction at 3-4 hours. She was also te s te d w ith various com ponents used in th e soldering operation. This te s t p roduced a severe asthm atic reaction starting 30-60 minutes after exposure ended and continuing for 6 w eeks b efo re her FEV 1 re tu rn e d to p r e te s t levels. Blood tests on these four p a tie n ts showed no eosinophilia, but sputum collected from the 54-year-old woman contained eosinophils. This suggested to the authors a reagin-mediated reaction\n【144】 - The se n sitiz e d individuals te s te d by Pepys and colleagues  had adverse re a c tio n s to TDI after exposures as brief as 10 minutes a t reported concentrations of a b o u t 2 ppb (14 u g /c u m). The au th o rs em p h asized th a t none of th e se sen sitized individuals had a known history of heavy TDI exposure, such as exposure to spills. Thus, it ap p ea rs th a t exposure to massive amounts of TDI, as from a spill, may not be necessary to produce sensitization\n【145】 - The sam e technique of challenge exposure to polyurethane varnish was used by C a rro ll and co w o rk ers  to te s t four em p lo y ees who w orked in an o ffic e a d ja c e n t to a fa c to ry th a t used TDI. Three clerical workers and a security guard, am ong 47 w orkers in th e office block, had histories of asthm a-like symptoms, and in tw o cases these were clearly alleviated during periods away from work. It was discovered th a t the air inlet for the office building was located only 23 feet from th e v e n tila tio n outflow of the factory that used TDI, but actual air concentrations in the offices were not determined\n【146】 - The p o ly u reth an e varnish m ixture used in the challenge testing was one-third TDI, and th e au th o rs  s ta te d th a t th e a tm o sp h e ric c o n c e n tra tio n of TDI c r e a te d by painting it on a surface in the test chamber was about 1 ppb (7 yg/cu m), but th e m ethod of d e te rm in a tio n was not described. Three of the patients reacted to TDI, one after a 15-minute exposure, one after 30 minutes, and one only a f te r a 6 0 -m in u te exposure\n【147】 - Exposures to the varnish without the TDI activator produced no reactions\n【148】 - The a u th o rs  also m en tio n ed th a t one ad d itio n al o ffic e w orker had a s th m a tic sym ptom s th a t w ere re lie v e d by removal from the environment. This suggests th a t 4 of th e 47 w orkers were sensitized to TDI, a sensitization rate of about 9%\n【149】 - To e v a lu a te th e s p e c ific ity of TDI sensitivity, O'Brien et al  tested the responses of TDI workers to TDI, histamine, and exercise. The 63 men studied had been referred for investigation of possible work-related respiratory symptoms. A s u b je c t was considered sensitive to TDI if his fall in FEV 1 after exposure was 15% more than on the control day. TDI concentrations in the cubicle w ere m easu red by a continuous monitor; in 23 cases, breathing-zone sampling was also p erfo rm e d , and the results of the two measurements were found to be closely correlated (r = 0.95)\n【150】 - F ifty -tw o of th e workers were also tested by inhaling an aerosol of histamine acid pho sp h ate a t g rad ed c o n c e n tra tio n s up to 32 m g /m l for 30-second periods\n【151】 - A 20% fall in FEV 1 was considered evidence of bronchial hyperreactivity. F o rty -six su b jects p a r tic ip a te d in e x e rc ise te s tin g , co n sistin g of fre e running sufficient to increase the heart rate to 140 beats/m inute. A fall in FEV 1 of more than 9% was re g a rd e d as in d ic a tiv e of an asthm atic reaction\n【152】 - All subjects were prick te s te d w ith 23 common respiratory allergens, and those who reacted to 1 or more were considered atopic\n【153】 - T h i r ty -s e v e n of th e 63 w o rk ers w ere se n sitiv e to TDI as in d ic a te d by respiratory responses to challenge testing, which included 2 immediate, 17 late, and 18 dual reactions . Nine of these workers reacted to TDI at concentrations of less than 1 ppb (7 y g /c u m). When ch allen g ed w ith h istam in e, 17  H ow ever, in th e subgroup of sensitive workers who responded to TDI at less than 1 ppb, there were significantly more reactions to both histamine (P<0.005) and e x e rc ise (P<0.01) than in those who reacted only at higher TDI concentrations; this extrem ely sensitive group also had a singificantly higher incidence of exerciseinduced a sth m a th an th e group th a t did not react to TDI (P<0.025). Age, atopic s ta tu s , and h isto ry of rh in itis w ere sim ilar in the TDI sensitive and nonsensitive groups, but th e re was a higher incidence of asthm a prior to work with TDI and of a fam ily h isto ry of allerg y in th e n o n sen sitiv e group. There was no significant d iffe re n c e s betw een smokers, exsmokers, and nonsmokers on the TDI, histamine, or exercise tests\n【154】 - In a fu rth e r stu d y , O 'B rien e t al  investigated cross-reactivity to TDI, MDI, and HDI in 24 d iiso cy an ate workers referred for investigation of respiratory sym ptom s\n【155】 - All 24 m en had been exposed to TDI, 14 to MDI, and 6 to HDI; 5 of the latter group had been exposed to all 3 diisocyanates. All su b jects w ere ch allen g ed w ith TDI by the procedure previously described and w ith MDI over th e sam e ran g e of co n cen tratio n s (<1-20 ppb) by heating the m a te ria l in a closed cubicle . Nine, including the six with previous exposure to H D I, w e re a lso c h a l le n g e d by p a in tin g w ith an HDI v a r n is h , b u t air c o n c e n tra tio n s of HDI w ere not measured. All subjects were tested by histamine inhalation\n【156】 - S ix teen of th e subjects were sensitive to TDI, and eight of these also reacted to MDI, including four who had no known previous exposure to MDI . Three of the nine w orkers te s te d with HDI showed positive responses; all three had also re a c te d to both TDI and MDI, and two of them had no previous exposure to HDI. H istam in e inhalation produced a positive reaction in five of the eight subjects who did not respond to challenge with diisocyanates, one of the eight who reacted only to TDI, and six of the eight who reacted to both TDI and MDI (including all three who also reacted to HDI). The authors reported that subjects who reacted to more than one d iiso c y an ate had a greater degree of histamine reactivity and reacted to TDI at lower concentrations than did those who reacted only to TDI. Among workers referred for respiratory symptoms, TDIsensitive individuals were no more likely to have nonspecific asthm atic responses to h istam in e or e x e rc ise than were those who did not react to TDI. However, those who showed e x tre m e se n s itiv ity to TDI, reacting at concentrations of less than 1 ppb, did have an increased incidence of nonspecific asthm atic responses, suggesting to the authors that specific sensitivity to TDI might be exacerbated by irritative or p h arm a co lo g ic h y p e rre a c tiv ity of th e airw ay s\n【157】 - The e x iste n c e of such a dual m echanism in individuals extremely sensitive to diisocyanates was supported by the re su lts of cross-challenging with TDI, MDI, and HDI . The authors considered th a t im m unologic c ro s s -re a c tiv ity b etw ee n th e se th r e e compounds was unlikely because of th e ir s tr u c tu ra l d iffe re n c e s\n【158】 - They concluded that their results were consistent with the existence of a specific mechanism of TDI sensitivity coupled, in e x tre m e ly sen sitiv e individuals, with a pharmacologic mechanism that also caused increased reactivity to other diisocyanates\n【159】 - Occupational exposure to MDI has produced respiratory effects similar to those reported from TDI exposure. Longley , in 1964, described an incident in which 12 m en who w orked 60-120 f e e t from an MDI foarn-spraying operation developed sym ptom s, including a sth m atic breathing, retrosternal soreness, constriction of the c h e st, cough, retrobulbar pain, depression, headache, nasal discharge, and insomnia. All 12 workers developed symptoms within several hours after exposure to the mist. The w orkers actually spraying the MDI foam, who wore full protective clothing and air-supplied respirators, were unaffected. Munn co n clu d ed th a t MDI was a p o te n tia l respiratory irritant and that in rare instances it could cause sensitization\n【160】 - In 1972, Lob  d escrib e d a reaction to MDI in a 50-year-old worker in a p o ly u reth an e fa c to ry who had no h isto ry of allergies, bronchitis, or asthma. He in te rm itte n tly e x p e rie n c e d m alaise acco m p an ied by fever, nausea, and coughing, usually a t th e end of th e day\n【161】 - A fte r one such a tta c k , a thorough examination showed th a t he had a slightly decreased vital capacity. A fter another attack, he had an increased white blood cell count (WBC) of 12,650/cu mm\n【162】 - To d e te rm in e th e fa c to rs producing th e se symptoms, Lob  exposed the worker for 3-4 minutes in a simulated operation where plastic belts were welded by h e a t. The au th o r s ta te d th a t MDI was d e te c te d in th e whitish fumes given off during th e w elding p ro cess, b u t th e c o n c e n tra tio n was not given; no TDI was d e te c te d . The worker's body tem perature increased to 39 C within 4-5 hours after he was exposed, and he had nausea and a severe cough. Vital capacity decreased slig h tly , WBC in c re ased , and he had c o n g este d conjunctiva, increased pulse, and decreased blood pressure. All these signs were normal the next day. Lob concluded t h a t th e o n s e t, s e v e rity , p e rs is te n c e , and re c u rre n c e of th e sym ptom s w ere suggestive of an allergic reaction to MDI\n【163】 - In 1971, Lapp  described the effects of brief exposures to TDI and MDI on th re e men. One was a 3 8 -y ear-o ld w orker in a chemical plant who had worked w ith d iiso c y an ate s for 13 years. The other two were 25-and 23-year-old medical o ffic e rs w ith no previous exposure to diisocyanates. Each subject slowly inhaled TDI from a sn iff b o ttle . A fter at least 1 day without exposure, each subject was challenged w ith MDI in the same manner. Pulmonary function of each subject was determined before and after each exposure\n【164】 - F ifte e n m in u tes a f te r TDI inhalation, the values for FVC, FEV 1, and forced e x p ira to ry flow b e tw e e n 25 and 75% of the FVC (FEF 25-75) in the worker who had previously been exposed to d iiso c y an ate s w ere 3.16, 2.79, and 3.62 liters, respectively, compared with corresponding preexposure values of 4.03, 3.68, and 5.92 liters. Airway resistance increased to 123% of the preexposure value at 15 minutes and 166% a t 30 m i n u te s\n【165】 - T The e f f e c ts of MDI w ere re v e rs e d follow ing ad m in istra tio n of a bronchodilator. Approximately 4-6 hours later, the man again ex p erien ced c h e st tightness and wheezing and his tem perature increased to 100 F. All th e se sym ptom s had disappeared by the next morning. The other two subjects showed no loss of pulm onary fu n ctio n a f te r exposure to MDI. Minor changes in th e ir airway resistance and thoracic volume were probably due to chance, according to the author, though he noted that these might have been caused by irritation\n【166】 - Lapp  co n clu d ed th a t th e ch anges o b serv ed in th e previously exposed individual who was ex p osed to TDI and MDI a t levels th a t did not cause such re a c tio n s in th e o th e r su b jects co n firm ed his re s p ira to ry s e n s itiv ity to th e se com pounds. Since the isocyanates to which this worker had previously been exposed w ere not id e n tifie d , this study does not provide ev id en ce on th e p o te n tia l of diisocyanates to produce cross-sensitization\n【167】 # (b) Immunologic Effects\n【168】 - The stu d ies discussed in th e preceding section indicate that some people are sen sitiv e to d iiso cy an ates, reacting to these substances in quantities much smaller than tho se th a t p roduce d ir e c t ir r ita tio n of th e lungs in most individuals. The m e c h a n is m of s e n s i t i z a t i o n to th e d iis o c y a n a te s has been in v e stig a te d in immunologic and pharmacodynamic studies on exposed workers\n【169】 - A lle r g ic responses th a t re s u lt from c irc u la tin g an tib o d ies can be e ith e r im m ediate or late, or a combination of the two. Immediate responses occur within m inutes of exposure to th e a n tig en , and late reactions appear a few hours after exposure. Im m ed iate re a c tio n s to some substances are associated with atopy, an in n a te te n d e n c y to d e v e lo p a lle rg ie s , w hich may be r e la te d to high serum c o n c e n tra tio n s of re a g in -ty p e im m unoglobulin (IgE). Atopy is often judged to be p resen t if tw o or m ore skin te s ts with common inhalant allergens such as pollen and animal dander are positive\n【170】 - Molecules with molecular weights of less than 10,000 are rarely antigenic; thus, im m unologic a c tiv ity of th e diisocyanates probably results from a reaction with a h ap ten com plex fo rm ed from a d iiso c y an ate and a naturally occurring antigenic s u b s t a n c e such as p ro te in or p o ly sacch arid e. B ecause iso c y a n a te s r e a c t w ith hydroxyl, am ino, su lfh y d ry l, or sim ilar groups, it is likely that hapten complexes may be fo rm ed\n【171】 - Most in v e stig a to rs who have stu d ie d th e immune response to d iiso c y an ate s have a tte m p te d to duplicate this hapten complex by conjugating the iso cy an a te w ith a protein such as egg albumin or human serum albumin for use as an an tig en in im m unologic te s ts , using a modification of the method described in 1964 by Scheel et al Four of these five, but only 1 of 21 unsensitized workers, had a history of allergies before working with diisocyanates. These four sensitized subjects also had c le a rly p o sitiv e ly m p h o cy te tra n s fo rm a tio n te s ts , although all had been without exposure to diisocyanates for at least 6 months before testing. Neither unexposed nor u n sen sitized exposed w orkers gave p o sitiv e resp o n ses in this test. Passive cu tan eo u s anaphylaxis (PCA), Prausnitz-Kuestner (P-K), leukocyte histamine release, passive h em ag g lu tin atio n , and gel d iffusion precipitin tests were negative in all subjects and did not identify the sensitized workers. Subsequent studies by Nava et al  and B utcher e t al  have not confirmed the diagnostic value of the lymphocyte transformation test for diisocyanate sensitivity. B ruckner and co w o rk ers  noted that all five sensitized workers had been exposed to d iiso c y an ate s a t c o n ce n tratio n s above 20 ppb. They also pointed out that the development of sensitization in these workers occurred only after 2 months to 5 years of repetitive exposures, concluding that overt clinical sensitization might be avoided if workers who showed increasingly severe signs of respiratory irritation were removed from further exposure to diisocyanates\n【172】 - In 1970, Taylor  attem p ted to detect circulating antibodies to TDI in 55 w orkers w ith sym ptom s su g g estiv e of TDI sensitivity. Their sera were compared w ith th o s e fro m 40 u n e x p o s e d t e x t i l e w orkers for an tib o d ies by te s ts for com plem en t fix atio n , PCA , and red-cell-linked antiglobulin. None of the control sera, but 23 of the te s t sera, gave p o sitiv e results in one or more tests. Five w ere positive in more than one test, but only one in all three tests. Six sera taken w ithin a few m onths of an unusually high exposure to TDI that produced severe sym ptom s all showed p o sitiv e te s t re su lts\n【173】 - T here was no co rrelatio n between p o s itiv e antibody te s ts and eosinophilia as d e te rm in e d from blood or sputum sam ples. The au th o r su g g ested th a t th e lack of c o rre la tio n between the tests indicated that they detect antibodies of slightly different specificity or of different immunoglobulin classes\n【174】 - In 1975, N ava e t al  d escrib ed im m unologic re s e a rc h on 182 clinical p a tie n ts , all but one of whom had respiratory symptoms, who had been exposed to d iiso c y an ate s in th e workplace. Ninety-six of these patients reacted positively to in tra d e rm a l te stin g w ith T D I-p ro tein conjugates. Thirty-seven of the 96 workers w ith positive tests and 6 of 86 with negative ones were atopic. However, in the 45 p a tie n ts w ith im m ed iate re a c tio n s , 60% were atopic. The authors concluded that atopy was not a f a c to r in TDI se n s itiz a tio n , since m o st p a tie n ts with positive reactions to TDI in intradermal tests were not atopic. However, their data suggest that atopy may be a predisposing factor. Nava and asso ciates  also performed pulmonary function testing on 45 of th e s e p a tie n ts who w ere exposed to TDI a t 100-130 y g /c u m (14-18 ppb) in ch allenge te s ts\n【175】 - T h irty -fiv e p a tie n ts showed decreased pulmonary function after TDI challenge. An immediate or dual response occurred in 25, whereas 10 had only a la te response; in c o n tra s t, over half the positive reactions in intraderm al tests co n sisted of a la te response only. Tests with acetylcholine on 18 subjects showed th a t those who w ere h y p e rre a c tiv e to th is b ro n c h o c o n s tric to r te n d ed to have im m e d i a te b r o n c h ia l re a c tio n s to TDI. This su g g ests th a t a p h arm aco lo g ic mechanism, as well as an immunologic one, is involved in diisocyanate sensitivity\n【176】 - In 1975, P o rte r e t al  published a retrospective study of sensitization in w orkers in a TDI manufacturing plant that had been in operation since 1956. The workforce exposed to TDI numbered about 200, remaining fairly constant throughout th e study period, and the turnover during the 17 years of the study was about 100 w orkers. The investigators examined medical records of the workers to determine th e r e la tio n s h ip of c l i n i c a l p r o b le m s to TDI c o n c e n tra tio n s in th e p la n t. Immunologic and lung function testing were performed on some workers. From 1956 to 1974, 30 of 300 workers at risk in the plant were judged on the basis of medical examinations to have become sensitized to TDI . At least six w orkers w ere h y p ersen sitiv e to TDI on first exposure, reacting at concentrations below 5 ppb (35 y g /c u m); in other workers, sensitization developed as late as 14 y ears a f te r in itia l exposure. The authors noted that, as individuals became more sensitized, they responded more quickly to TDI exposures and recovered more slowly a f te r rem oval from ex posure\n【177】 - T able III-1 shows th e num ber of new c ases of s e n s itiz a tio n diagnosed eac h y ear in relation to the average air concentration of TDI. The d a ta in d ic a te th a t a d o se-resp o n se relationship for sensitization may ex ist. It is also clear, however, that the incidence of sensitization decreased with tim e during th e y ears b e fo re 1970 w hen th e re w ere no s ig n ific a n t changes in av era g e TDI c o n c e n tra tio n s . The au th o rs a ttr ib u te d th is not only to improved control of peak concentrations and increased employee understanding of TDI effects, but also to possible \"hardening\" of exposed workers\n【178】 - It appears m ore likely th a t m ost p o te n tia lly s e n s itiz a b le w orkers became se n sitiz e d during th e ir e a rlie r y ears a t th e higher exposures. The authors  noted th a t sensitized workers were relocated out of the TDI handling area to other parts of the plant. These considerations preclude the assumption that 20 ppb can be reg ard ed as a no-effect level for sensitization on the basis of this study. The low tu rn o v er r a te im plies th a t only an average of 5-6 workers each year were newly exposed to TDI, so that most of the workers exposed during the last 3 years of the study already had several years of exposure at higher average concentrations. Some w orkers b eca m e sensitized after 14 years of exposure, indicating th at some of the s e n s i t i v i t y c a s e s r e p o r t e d in a b o u t 1970 d ev elo p ed when th e a v e ra g e TDI c o n c e n t r a t i o n s w ere ab o u t 60 ppb. It is u n clear w h eth er th e a u th o rs used a w eighting procedure in calculating the average concentrations, or perhaps, averaged a ll r e s u l t s\n【179】 - F o r th is r e a s o n it is im p o s s ib le to co n c lu d e w h at th e TWA c o n c e n tra tio n s w ere in the plant, and thus impossible to ascertain a concentration sufficiently low to prevent sensitization. P o rte r e t al  also presented case studies and results of immunologic and pulm onary fu n ctio n te s tin g fo r 32 of th e w orkers in th is p lan t; some of these workers had signs of respiratory illness, according to medical diagnosis, while others w ere a sy m p to m a tic\n【180】 - Sera from th e s e w orkers w ere te s te d for the presence of   an tib o d ies with the P-K test in monkeys and the PC A te st in guinea pigs, by using a te s t antigen of TDI conjugated with serum protein from the same animal species; this is th e only im m unologic study found on TDI th a t used antigens made with hom ologous p ro tein s in th e se te s ts . The P-K te s t was intended to identify IgE an tib o d ies, which th e au th o rs e x p e c te d to be a ss o c ia te d w ith h y p ersensitivity re a c tio n s, and th e PCA w as to id e n tify c irc u la tin g IgG antibodies, which they assum ed to confer immunologic protection. The workers' sera were similarly tested with a common pollen antigen\n【181】 - In th e cases d escrib ed , there was no correlation between the presence of IgE or IgG an tib o d ies ag ain st TDI and e ith e r clin ical sym ptom s, lung function, or reactivity to pollen antigens. For example, apparent sensitivity to TDI accompanied by loss of lung fu n ctio n was re p o rte d in a worker who had a positive PCA test w ith TDI an tig en but not with pollen antigen and in one who gave a positive P-K te s t w ith pollen but show ed no antibodies against TDI; another sensitized worker had positiv e PCA to both TDI and pollen but refused pulmonary function testing. Two w orkers w ith s e n s itiz a tio n re a c tio n s to TDI had p o sitiv e results with TDI an tig en in th e P-K te s t , but no loss of lung function. Workers who showed no sig n s of se n s itiz a tio n to TDI included som e who gave n eg a tiv e re s u lts in all im m unologic te sts and others with positive reactions to TDI in the PCA, P-K test, or both. These re su lts do not support the authors' hypothesis regarding the roles of IgE and IgG an tib o d ies in TDI se n s itiz a tio n . The authors attributed the loss of lung fu n ctio n , which was a p p a re n tly in d ep en d en t of th e p resen ce of an tib o d ies, to b ronchoco n strictio n ; the reactions of these individuals occurred almost immediately upon exposure and w ere relieved by treatm en t with a bronchodilator. In contrast, clinical reactions in the two workers with positive immunologic tests but no loss of lung function had developed gradually after several years of exposure. The findings of th is s tu d y i n d i c a t e t h a t an im m unologic m echanism may be involved in diisocyanate sensitivity but that sensitivity in some individuals may also result from a nonimmunologic mechanism\n【182】 - As part of a long-term study of workers exposed to TDI, described in detail in E pidem iologic Studies, Butcher and associates  reported in 1976 the results of im m unologic and in h a latio n ch allen g e studies of 167 employees who worked in a fa c to ry producing TDI. B efo re TDI p ro d u ctio n began and a t 6 and 18 months afterw ard, employees were prick-tested to determine their reactivity to a conjugate of TDI with human serum albumin (HSA) and to HSA alone. They were also prickte s te d w ith 15 common inhalant allergens. Using blood taken from the workers at th e s a m e t e s t in te r v a ls , th e in v e stig a to rs d e te rm in e d eosinophil counts and im m unoglobulin levels\n【183】 - To identify TDI-specific antibodies, sera were tested with the TDI-HSA antigen by radioimmunoassay tests, the PCA test on guinea pigs, and Workers were subdivided into groups with constant, interm ittent, or no exposure . On initial testing, four workers had positive skin reactions to both TDI-HSA and HSA a lo n e ; h o w ev er, during th e th ird p lan t v isit 6 m onths la te r , th re e individuals r e a c te d p o sitiv ely to TDI-HSA but not to HSA. The authors did not in d icate the exposure groups of th e se persons, but they noted that none of the three showed clinical respiratory responses to TDI\n【184】 - Both b efo re and after TDI production began, PCA, P-K, and radioimmunoassay te s ts for TDI an tib o d ies w ere negative in all subjects . Eosinophil counts did not d iffe r in exposed and unexposed groups. Immunoglobin levels were similar in all th re e exposure groups\n【185】 - Six m onths after production began, both IgG and IgE had in c re ased sig n ifican tly over p reex p o su re values; however, this increase was ap p a re n t in all groups, and the IgE increase was greatest in the unexposed group. The au th o rs therefore concluded that the increase was not related to TDI exposure but probably reflected seasonal variation. H ow ever, th e au th o rs n o te d that the number of individuals tested was too small to indicate that antibody titer was proportional to exposure\n【186】 - In a 1973 NIOSH h e a lth h azard ev alu atio n , V an dervort and Lucas  in v e stig a te d im m unologic resp on ses of 90 w orkers exposed to MDI a t average c o n c e n tra tio n s of up to 11 ppb (110 U g/cu m) in a plant manufacturing fibrous glass tan k s. PCA , P-K , and agglutination tests were carried out with a \"specially prepared isocyanate antigen,\" not otherwise characterized. Of 12 men with positive P-K te s ts , 2 showed respiratory responses to MDI, and 1 had decreased pulmonary function; pulm onary fu n ctio n te stin g was recom m ended for 2 others to evaluate their status. The other seven showed no evidence of adverse reactions to MDI, and th e au th o rs co n sid ered th em \"hardened\" to its effects. Forty workers who gave positive results only in the PCA or agglutination tests were also asymptomatic. It is possible, as th e authors suggested, that certain workers giving positive tests for an tib o d ies w ere im m unologically \"hardened\" to th e effects of MDI and that the c irc u la tin g IgG an tib o d ies th a t m ight be in d ic a te d by positive PCA tests were involved in c o n ferrin g such im m unologic p ro te c tio n\n【187】 - H ow ever, th e inadequate c h a ra c te r iz a tio n of the antigen used in testing makes it difficult to determine the validity of these results\n【188】 - To evaluate whether the difficulty in detecting diisocyanate antibodies might be due to nonavailability of exposed hapten groups in the antigen, Karol e t al , in a 1978 study, used a c o n ju g ate of p -to ly l isocyanate with human serum albumin (TMI-HSA) as a te s t a n tig en . B ecause it contained only one isocyanate group on eac h m olecule, this monoisocyanate would not cross-link the protein component of th e an tig en , increasing the probability that the tolyl portion of the molecule would be ste ric a lly exposed. The authors tested 23 employees of a large TDI production fa c ility , 4 of whom w ere considered sensitized to TDI. Three of these had had a sen sitiv ity response, e ith e r bronchial or skin reac tio n , within 1 year before the study; the fourth had avoided exposure to TDI for at least 2 years. The remaining 19 w orkers w ere co n sid ered unsen sitized because they showed no adverse effects when exposed to TDI; in som e c a ses, this judgm ent was confirmed by negative results in challenge tests with TDI at 20 ppb (140 yg/cu m)\n【189】 - A radioimmunoassay for IgE bound to TMI-HSA showed that the 19 unsensitized w o rk e rs had antibody ti te r s sim ilar to th o se of 10 blood-blank donors  . H ow ever, th e se n sitiz e d group show ed a significantly elevated titer of anti-tolyl an tib o d ies (P<0.01). The th re e workers who had had TDI reactions within the last year had antibody titers higher than any of the unsensitized or control individuals. Serum -binding to th e an tig en was inhibited in the presence of nonisocyanate tolyl com pounds, suggesting to the authors that the antibodies were toly 1-specific. There was no co rrelation between the tolyl-specific IgE antibodies and the levels of total IgE in the sera. Incubating lym phocytes from sen sitiv e and nonsensitive workers with TDI in the absence of iso p ro te re n o l did not a f f e c t cy clic AMP levels. T h ere was a d o se-dependent inhibition of iso p ro teren o l-stim u lated cyclic AMP levels in lymphocytes from both sensitive and nonsensitive subjects; there was no significant difference in the ability of cells from these two groups to exhibit cyclic AMP stimulation\n【190】 - In th e m echolyl ch allen g e stu d ie s, 6 of th e 10 clinically sensitive subjects showed a drop in FEV 1 of m ore th an 20% w ithin 1.5 m in u tes a f te r a single inh alatio n of mecholyl . Only 1 of the 10 nonsensitized subjects gave such a response, and this occurred 5 minutes after inhaling mecholyl four times\n【191】 - This study  indicates that TDI is not a histamine releaser per se but that it does suppress stimulation of the beta-adrenergic system by isoproterenol. These resu lts a g re e w ith those of a similar study by Van Ert and Battigelli  on the e f f e c ts of TDI on h ista m in e release in vitro. Butcher et al  concluded that th e ir findings suggested that TDI may act as a beta-receptor blocking agent. This would produce increased reactivity to agents capable of causing bronchoconstriction, such as m echolyl. In a follow up re p o rte d in tw o 1978 abstracts , blood te stin g a f te r ch allen g e ex posures to TDI show ed that histamine levels increased a f te r a bronchial re a c tio n , w hile com plem ent components were not affected. In this study, all TDI r e a c to r s r e a c te d p o sitiv ely to m echolyl ch allen g e, and the au th o rs  n o ted that kinetic studies had revealed a strong indication that cells from TDI re a c to rs respond d iffe re n tly th an th o se of n o n re a c to rs to the betaadrenergic agonists isoproterenol and prostaglandin E, and to TDI added alone. These stu d ies  suggest that a pharmacologic mechanism is involved in r e s p i r a t o r y s e n s i t i v i t y to TDI, b ut th e re is no in d icatio n w h eth er m echolyl hyperreactivity is a preexisting factor or a result of TDI exposure\n【192】 (c) Skin Effects Some diisocyanates have been described as skin irritants , but there are few re p o rts in th e lite r a tu r e of skin effects from these compounds. Munn  has noted th a t, in several years of study, he has seen only two mild cases of skin irrita tio n from d iiso c y an ate s and no cases of skin sensitization. Bruckner et al  re p o rte d that 6 of 44 workers in a chemical plant experienced skin irritation a ttrib u te d to exposure to unspecified diisocyanates. These reactions consisted of e ry th e m a only on areas of skin that were in actual contact with the diisocyanates. One w orker who o fte n had d iiso c y an ate s on his hands n o ted th a t his skin had become hard and smooth, so that he had difficulty in turning pages\n【193】 - Possible skin sensitization to TDI was described in two of the studies discussed in th e previous section. Nava et al  reported that a worker with eczematous d e rm a titis was 1 of 3 w orkers who reacted positively to TDI in a patch test, out of 182 workers tested. Karol e t al  found tolyl-specific IgE antibodies in two w orkers who displayed im m e d ia te skin reactions when exposed to TDI, apparently w ithout a bronchial response. These skin reactions were extensive and not confined to areas where TDI had contacted the skin\n【194】 - Rothe , in 1976, described 20 cases of occupational skin disease in workers exposed to poly u reth an es. Clinical examinations, observation of the course of the disease, reex p o su re te s ts , and skin te s ts were carried out. Standard and special te s ts using a v ariety of isocyanates, amines, and additives were used to determine the specific sensitivity of the workers. R othe  found 12 cases of c o n ta c t e c z e m a c h a r a c te r iz e d by follicular papules in w orkers exposed to MDI or p artially polymerized MDI. Ten of these co n stitu ted more than half the total number of workers who had come into contact w ith a p o ly u reth an e sealing com pound a t one plant, and two were from another plan t\n【195】 - S everal in sp ectio n s showed that there was very close contact between the w orkers' skin and th e sealing com pound\n【196】 - Work c lo th e s were often soaked with resin. The workers had positive skin test reactions to the isocyanate component of th e sealing com pound\n【197】 - T w en ty -fiv e unexposed persons with eczem a had negative r e s u lt s\n【198】 - Five of seven w orkers w ith MDI a lle rg ie s e x h ib ite d ty p ical e c z e m a re a c tio n s to diaminodiphenyl methane (MDA). Only one of these had had previous contact with the MDA, which was not used at the plant. Skin disease disap p eared in all four persons se n sitiz e d to IPDI a f te r exposure was stopped. T hree of th e in v e stig a to rs tested themselves with undiluted IPDI and no reactions o ccu rred w ithin 4 days  . However, two of the three investigators developed fo llicu lar papules 10 days a f te r te stin g . Sensitization in these investigators was confirm ed in a la te r test with a 1% IPDI solution, which produced no reactions in six nonexposed subjects\n【199】 - The o th e r four p a tie n ts with skin disease included two cases of eczem a from TDI exposure, one case with exposure mainly to TDI but also to MDI, and one case of eczem a probably related to exposure to triphenylmethane triisocyanate . In all 20 cases th e re was a pattern of brief exposure to the isocyanate, often caused by spills, with subsequent development of eczema. In most cases, sensitization was co n firm ed by sk in -te stin g with a dilute solution of the isocyanate suspected to be the agent\n【200】 # UU Other Effects\n【201】 - A lthough m ost re p o rts of diisocyanate toxicity have described effects on the resp ira to ry tr a c t or skin, some have noted other effects. These have included eye irritation, psychologic symptoms and CNS effects, and hematologic changes. Most of th e se e f f e c ts have o c c u rre d following mixed exposures to diisocyanates and other c h e m ic a ls , an d su c h e f f e c t s can n o t be c le a rly ascrib e d to th e d iiso c y an ate exposures\n【202】 - S everal stu d ies have su g g ested th a t TDI, esp ecially a t very high exposure levels, may cause neu ro lo g ic or CNS e f f e c ts\n【203】 - In th e firs t published report of occupational illness from TDI exposure, Fuchs and Valade  noted that insomnia was o fte n th e firs t co m p lain t of a f f e c te d w o rk ers, p reced in g any re sp ira to ry sym ptom s. They also m en tio n ed that three patients had a decrease of the kneejerk and A chilles re fle x e s . In one patient, who completely lacked these reflexes, th e cond itio n p e rsiste d for 2 months after he stopped working with TDI and then ab ru p tly re tu rn e d to no rm al. In th e ab sen ce of other signs of exposure-related nervous d iso rd ers, th e a u th o rs did not specifically im plicate TDI as the cause of this condition\n【204】 - A 1964 USSR study  investigated the effects of TDI on electrical activity in th e human cerebral cortex. No experimental details were reported, but TDI was said to a f f e c t electroencephalographic (EEG) rhythms at a threshold concentration of 100 U g/cu m (14 ppb). This study was not included in th e 1973 c r ite r ia docum ent on TDI . Little can be made of these results in the absence of any inform atio n on experimental methods, but the implication of CNS effects at a such a low concentration suggests that such effects should be more carefully evaluated\n【205】 - In 1965, a Canadian report  indicated that 12 of 24 maintenance workers d e v e lo p e d r e s p i r a t o r y s y m p to m s a f t e r th e y had c lean ed pipes and vessels c o n ta m in a te d w ith TDI. In ad d itio n , four of th e workers developed psychologic problems, including anxiety neuroses, psychosomatic complaints, depression, and even paranoid te n d en cie s. A year after exposure, they had not returned to work; some s till com plained of cough and d iffic u lty in b re a th in g , although their pulmonary fu n ctio n te s ts were normal. This report suggests the possibility th at TDI produces CNS e ff e c ts ; cleaning p ro cesses, how ever, involve th e use of solvents to which th e se CNS e f f e c ts m ight be attributed. This report did not detail the procedures or solvents used in cleaning the TDI-contaminated vessels\n【206】 - B urton  , review ing O n tario w orkm en's co m p en sa tio n claim s in 1972, m entioned an in cid en t of TDI exp o su re in a rubber plant. One of three women em ployees who developed chronic obstructive lung disease after an acute exposure to TDI also had a \"psychogenic problem,\" not otherwise described. N ev erth eless, it is not unequivocal that the effects reported were caused by TDI\n【207】 - In a 1962 report, Filatova et al  described the effects of mixed exposures to TDI, ch lo ro b en zen e, phosgene, to lu en e diam ine, and HDI on 63 men and 17 w om en who had m anufactured diisocyanates for 1-2 years. These effects included irrita tio n of th e ey es, nose, and skin, coughing, difficulty in breathing, headaches, in s o m n ia , w eak n ess, tre m o rs , re fle x ch an g es, and c h e s t and abdom inal pain. H e m a to lo g ic te s ts show ed d e c re a se s in eosinophils and n eu tro p h ils, and some w orkers had slightly en larg ed liv ers w ith no functional impairment. The authors concluded th a t th e substances produced during diisocyanate production were toxic, but they could not a ttr ib u te th e sym ptom s to TDI alone, since other compounds that were present could have produced similar effects. O n ly th e HDI concentrations were said to be in excess of the MAC\n【208】 - Thirty-two workers complained of headaches, 36 of increased perspiration, 20 of aches in th e a re a of the heart and under the right ribs, 13 of dream disturbances, 12 of difficulty in breathing, 19 of general weakness, and 6 of coughing . All w orkers re p o rte d th a t HDI vapor irritated their eyes and upper respiratory tract. N in eteen w orkers, who had w orked in th e p lan t for 7-13 y ears, had developed slightly en larg ed liv ers th a t w ere painful upon palpation. Duodenal sampling and blood bilirubin and cholesterol analyses revealed no hepatic lesions. Most of the 55 w orkers ex am in ed for liver abnorm alities showed hypocholesteremia, indicating to th e au th o rs an early sta g e of d istu rb a n ce of liv er function. Most workers also showed abnormalities in blood proteins and serum cholinesterase activity\n【209】 - A pproxim ately 50% of the examined workers had developed chronic subatrophic pharyngitis w ith o u t any p ath o lo g ic changes in th e lungs  . Effects on the ca rd io v ascu lar system were seen in 47 workers, 27-40 years old, more than half of whom had sinus arh y th m ia , b ra d y c a rd ia , e x tra s y s to le , and slowing of endoatrial co n d u ctiv ity indicative of toxic myocardiodystrophy. Some workers had trem ors of the fingers and eyelids and increased muscular excitability. Filatova et al  concluded that the adverse effects on workers' health were produced by a m ix tu re of to x ic com pounds whose main component was HDI. No o th e r re p o rts of h e p a to to x ic ity or cardiovascular effects in diisocyanate workers have been found\n【210】 - It should be noted that chlorobenzene is a hepatotoxin that has re p o rte d ly cau sed h e p a tic necrosis in animals at high doses  and produced an increase in liver weight in rats inhaling 1,150 mg/cu m for 6 months\n【211】 # Epidemiologic Studies\n【212】 - Studies of w orker p o pulations exposed to TDI have r e la te d environm ental exposure levels to th e incidence and severity of respiratory symptoms, changes in pulm onary function, and immunologic reactivity. Investigations of workers exposed to MDI and HDI have g en era lly provided less useful data because they involved mixed exposures to several other toxic chemicals\n【213】 - In 1957, H am a e t al  re p o rte d th a t 12 workers exposed to isocyanates (TDI) a t 30-70 ppb (210-500 ug/cu m) for 1 week in an automobile plant had mild to sev ere re sp ira to ry symptoms including cold symptoms, continuous coughing, sore th ro at, dyspnea, fatigue, and nocturnal sweating. No symptoms had developed during th e previous m onth when isocyanate concentrations were below 10 ppb (70 Ug/cu m), and when concentrations were subsequently reduced to the 10-30 ppb range (70-210 u g /c u m), no fu rth e r co m p lain ts o c c u rre d in over 3 m onths\n【214】 - A w ritte n co m m unicatio n from Hama (3une 1973) confirmed that the isocyanate was TDI and in d icate d th a t exp o su re concentration measurements were based on breathing-zone sam ples an aly zed by th e R a n ta m ethod. This m ethod is unable to distinguish b e tw e e n TDI and th e TDI u re a fo rm ed in th e p re se n c e of w a te r\n【215】 - Thus, the concentrations of TDI in the area were probably less than the reported values\n【216】 - A d e ta ile d 2 .5 -y ear study by W alw orth and Virchow  of a polyurethane foam p lan t was published in 1959. TDI concentrations ranged as high as 300 ppb . E ig h ty -th re e cases of respiratory illness that required medical attention were a ttrib u te d to TDI ex posure; m ost of them occurred after 3-4 weeks of exposure. The to ta l num ber of w orkers a t risk was not reported. The authors noted that t h e r e w as l i t t l e c o r r e l a t i o n b etw ee n m easu red TDI c o n c e n tra tio n s and the app earan ce of respiratory symptoms. They attributed this largely to short exposures a t high c o n c e n tra tio n s not r e f le c te d in th e m easurem ents of average exposures. They added that once workers experienced adverse effects from TDI they could not tolerate even minute exposures\n【217】 - In 1964, to x ic e ffe c ts from TDI in workers in three New Zealand plants were reported . At one plant, where usual TDI concentrations ranged from 3 to 120 ppb (20-850 y g /c u m), three cases of respiratory sensitization occurred in 1 year. In tw o of th e se w orkers, sym ptom s first appeared after 2-3 hours of pouring TDI inside a r e f r ig e ra te d van, w here unusually high concentrations were likely. The third w orker, whose sym ptom s developed gradually, could work 50-60 feet away from th e foaming operation, where TDI concentrations were about 5 ppb (35 yg/cu m), but he had a respiratory reaction when he worked within the foaming area. In a sim ilar p la n t, w here TDI co n cen tratio n s were usually below 20 ppb (140 yg/cu m), t h e r e w e re tw o c a s e s of mild cold sym ptom s and one case of possible s e n sitiz a tio n , all a ss o c ia te d w ith a foam ing o p e ra tio n in w hich concentrations reac h ed 100 ppb (700 y g /c u m). This p lan t also reported one case of a severe a s th m a tic a tta c k and co llap se in a worker exposed at a very high concentration. He subsequently re tu rn e d to work with no evidence of sensitization. In the third plan t, tw o w orkers exposed to TDI at 18 ppb (130 yg/cu m) wearing canister-type m asks e x p erien ced very mild cold symptoms at the end of the day when a double run was carried out. The total workforce at risk in these plants was not reported\n【218】 - In 1962, Elkins et al  described experiences with TDI in 15 Massachusetts plants over a 5 -y ear period\n【219】 - They e v a lu a te d th e c ases of re s p ira to ry illness o ccu rrin g in eac h of the plants and made environmental measurements, apparently from a re a sam ples\n【220】 - Most of th e sam ples were analyzed by the Marcali method. The R a n ta m ethod was used for some of the early measurements and found to be less a c c u ra te , but the authors did not indicate which measurements were made by this method. Other methods used in a few plants reportedly gave results comparable to the Marcali method. The findings of Elkins and coworkers, as adapted by NIOSH to p r e s e n t w h a t w e re c o n s id e r e d to be re le v a n t d o se-resp o n se d a ta , w ere sum m arized in the 1973 TDI criteria document , and are shown in III-2. This ta b le om its data from plants where environmental levels were not determined or w here th e au th o rs considered that these measurements were not representative of exposure\n【221】 - The numbers given for workers at risk are probably somewhat higher than th e a c tu a l num bers exposed to TDI, which could not be determined from the paper\n【222】 - Elkins e t al  found a to ta l of established cases and 73 questionable cases of re s p ira to ry illness a s s o c ia te d with TDI exposure. Concentrations higher than 20 ppb (140 yg/cu m) were measured in only three plants. From the data in III-2, it can be seen that cases of respiratory illness were associated with all exposure co n cen tratio n s above 10 ppb (70 yg/cu m), but there were no cases at 7 ppb (50 y g /c u m) or low er\n【223】 - At 9 ppb th e re w ere no established cases but one q u estio n ab le one; th e re w ere sev eral estab lish ed cases a t 8 ppb. The authors concluded that the environmental limit for TDI should be considerably less than 100 ppb (700 y g /c u m), and th ey su g g ested th a t 10 ppb (70 yg/cu m) was \"not an unreasonable limit.\" E ight m en who had a positive reaction to histamine had a larg er daily decrease in FEV 1 than did nonreactors (0.310 vs 0.115 liter). Smoking status was not significantly related to the changes in FEV 1. It is therefore difficult to evaluate the significance of the changes reported\n【224】 - The following year, Williamson  reported the results of pulmonary function te stin g over a 14-m onth period on 15 w orkers in an o p e ra tio n w here TDI was se p a ra te d from a so lv en t by d istilla tio n\n【225】 - Frequent environmental measurements w ere m ade and th e se never show ed TDI concentrations above 20 ppb (140 Ug/cu m), but av era g e c o n c e n tra tio n s w ere not given. One major spill occurred during th e study, causing c o n c e n tra tio n s high enough to permit detection of odor, from w hich th e au th o r in fe rre d th a t th e c o n c e n tra tio n was at least 200 ppb, and the room was immediately cleared\n【226】 - All the workers tested were free of respiratory symptoms . In four series of m easurem ents of FVC and FEV 1, the only significant change was a fall in FEV 1 a t the tim e of the second measurement (P<0.01), and subsequent tests showed no significant change from baseline FEV 1 values. There was little difference between Monday and Friday values; daily changes were not measured. Williamson  No sig n ific a n t d iffe re n c e in respiratory symptoms was found b etw een 76 currently employed men exposed to TDI and controls. Nine of 76 men in the co n tro l group had w heezing, co m p ared with only 1 of 76 men exposed to TDI\n【227】 - In th e second p a rt of the study, Adams  exam ined men who had been rem oved from th e TDI p la n ts b ecau se of re s p ira to ry symptoms such as mild to severe bronchospasm and dyspnea\n【228】 - A bout 15% of the men employed in the TDI p lant w ere rem oved from th e p lan ts in th e ir 1st year b eca u se th ey developed re s p ira to ry symptoms. In the 2nd year of employment, only 3.5% of the remaining w orkers developed re s p ira to ry sym ptom s, and th e rate gradually dropped to less than 2%/year after the 5th year, totaling about 20% of the original workforce over th e 9 years of the study. In form ation on symptoms in 46 men removed from the plan t, who had not been exposed to TDI for 2-11 years, was collected annually by respiratory questionnaire and compared with responses from 46 age-m atched workers not exposed to TDI. These results were correlated with the results of pulmonary fu n ctio n te s ts\n【229】 - The d a ta w ere analyzed for statistical significance by chi-square test\n【230】 - D ata from 46 co n tro ls and 46 m en previously exposed to TDI show ed no d i f f e r e n c e s in t h e i r sm o k in g h ab its\n【231】 - H ow ever, 17 of th e 46 w orkers previously exposed to TDI developed breathlessness after exertion, significantly more th a n th e 5 m en in th e c o n tro l group w ith this sym ptom (P<0.01). W heezing o cc u rre d in 17 w orkers but only in 7 controls (P<0.05). These findings indicated th a t re s p ira to ry sym ptom s p e rs is te d in som e subjects after exposure to TDI had ceased\n【232】 - Pulmonary function data for 61 men who had had no contact with TDI for 2-11 years showed th a t th e ir av e ra g e FVC and FEV 1 values were slightly lower than control values after adjustment for age and height . Eleven of the 20 workers who had been rem o v ed from the plants because of sensitization to TDI and whose p reem p lo y m en t lung fu n ctio n records were available were asymptomatic after 3-8 years w ith o u t ex p osure, and 12 of these 20 had FEV 1 and FVC values unchanged from th e ir p reem p lo y m en t levels. Six had FEV 1 and FVC values between 90 and 100% of th e ir p reem p lo y m en t levels, and two had values of 80-90%. Those who had red u ced pulm onary fu n ctio n co m p lain ed of dyspnea on e x e rtio n , nocturnal dyspnea, and tightness in the chest\n【233】 - Adams  concluded th a t exposure to TDI at about 20 ppb (140 Ug/cu m) for 5 y ears did not in c re a se respiratory symptoms or affect the lung function of w orkers who w ere not se n s itiz e d to the compound. However, sensitized workers, even when no longer exposed to TDI, had m ore re s p ira to ry symptoms than did unexposed controls, suggesting th at effects of TDI are, to some extent, irreversible. F or e n v iro n m en ta l m easu rem en ts, area samples, apparently collected at 6-month intervals, were analyzed by the Marcali method\n【234】 - The initial study , made during December 1966, included 38 workers, 7 of them w om en, w ith an average age of 36.3 years (range 18-62 years), employed an av era g e of 104.6 w eeks (2-624 weeks). Environmental measurements taken during this period show ed TDI co n cen tratio n s ranging from 0.1 to 3.0 ppb (0.7-21 ug/cu m). Pulmonary function measurements on 34 workers showed a mean daily decrease in FEV 1 of 0.19 lite r (P<0.001). S ignificant daily decreases were also noted in FVC (P 0 .0 0 1 ), PFR (P<0.05), FR50% (P<0.01), and FR25% (P<0.05). From Monday m orning to F riday m orning, th e m ean FEV 1, FR 50% , and FR25% all showed significant decreases (P<0.001). Responses for smokers and nonsmokers were similar, but w orkers with respiratory symptoms had a significantly greater decrease in FEV 1 than those without symptoms (P<0.05). The authors noted that there appeared to be no rela tio n sh ip b e tw e e n pulm onary fu n ctio n changes and amount of exposure, which they judged from the distance between work stations and sources of TDI\n【235】 - At th e 6-m onth followup , 28 of the 34 workers were still employed, and 6 new w orkers w ere added to th e study group. Environmental concentrations at th a t tim e ranged from undetecto a high of 12.0 ppb (85 ug /cu m) in the TDI pouring a re a\n【236】 - Monday p resh ift and postshift measurements of pulmonary function showed significant decreases (P<0.02) in both FVC and FEV 1; Tuesday morning tests sh o w e d e s s e n t i a l l y c o m p le te re c o v e ry in FVC, but FEV 1 valu es w ere s till significantly lower than on the previous morning\n【237】 - When pulm onary fu n ctio n te s t re su lts w ere compared with those from tests done 6 m onths e a rlie r, sig n ific a n t decreases were found in FEV 1, the ratio FEV 1/FVC, and FR values at 75, 50, 25, and 10% of vital capacity . The authors noted th a t th e re was a high c o rre la tio n (r=0.72) between the 1-day and 6-month d e c r e a s e s in FEV 1\n【238】 - T he only o th er v aria b le sig n ific a n tly c o r r e la te d w ith pulm onary fu n ctio n test results was lifetime smoking history, and when this factor was held constant, the 6-month changes in FEV 1 were still significantly correlated with diurnal changes (r=0.60)\n【239】 - The 12-m onth followup, made in December 1967, showed a much lower diurnal d ec re a se in FEV 1, 0.05 lite r\n【240】 - In th e 25 workers still available from the original 34, the decrease in FEV 1 over 1 year was still significant, but the entire d ec re a se was a c c o u n te d for by changes during the first 6 months. The authors noted th a t TDI concentrations measured at this time were very low; the maximum concentration detected was only 1.5 ppb (11 Ug/cu m). In itial m e asu re m en ts show ed a dose-related diurnal decrease in FEV 1 in the th re e groups . At the 2-year followup , only 63 members of the original w orkforce were still employed. Examination of records showed that 40 of those no longer em ployed had resig n ed v o lu n tarily and th a t th e se w orkers had shown a diurnal decrease in FEV 1 of 0.126 liter at the earlier testing, compared with 0.096 lite r in th o se who w ere still employed. While this difference was not significant, th e authors noted that it reflected a trend for self-selection based on health among TDI workers\n【241】 - In g e n e ra l, work assig n m en ts had been sover the 2 years, with workers averaging 20 months at a work station; workers were therefore assigned to exposure groups on the basis of their usual work station . Since 5 workers had variable exposures and could not be assigned to any group, final testing was performed on 57 w orkers; 20 of these in each of the high and low exposure groups and 17 were in th e m edium exposure group. The incidence of coughing and phlegm production in c re ased w ith higher ex p o su re; 15% of the 57-person study group had symptoms suggestive of chronic bronchitis, but these were not related to exposure level. The 2-year d e c re a se in FEV 1 a v e ra g e d 0.102 liter (SD = 0.204 liter) in the exposed w orkers; th e groups with low, medium, and high exposure had respective decreases of 0.012, 0.085, and 0.205 liter (SD = 0.204, 0.177, and 0.185 liter). The authors noted th a t th e d e c re a se in the high-exposure group was \"clearly excessive,\" while th a t in th e low -exposure group was \" c le a rly w ithin normal limits.\" The authors' analysis of v arian ce show ed th e d iffe re n c e in 2-year decrem ent in FEV 1 in the th re e groups to be significant at P<0.01. Age, length of employment, and smoking habits did not d iffe r significantly in the three groups. Since several factors that a f f e c t lung size, including sex, h eig h t, and race, differed among the groups, the au th o rs sta n d a rd iz e d fo r lung size by dividing the 2-year decrease by the initial FEV 1 m e a su re m e n t; th is standardized still showed a significant difference between exposure groups. T h ere was no significant difference in mean FEV 1 b etw ee n w orkers exposed for less th an 3 y ears and those exposed 10-25 y ears, although the m ean for sm okers was sig n ifican tly different from that for nonsm okers\n【242】 - L ab o ra to ry te s ts in d ic a te d th e re w ere no alterations of peripheral blood values, hematopoietic system, or kidney function\n【243】 - Weili e t al  and Butcher et al  have reported on the first 5 y ears of a lo n g itu d in al study of respiratory symptoms, pulmonary function, and im m u n e re sp o n se s in w orkers a t a T D I-m an u fac tu rin g p la n t\n【244】 - The study was in itia te d in April 1973, before TDI production began at the plant, and is planned to extend through 1978. In the 1978 annual report on this study, Weill e t al  noted that only 88 of th e origin al 166 w orkers were still participating. To offset attrition, workers had been added during the first 3 years of the study, so that some data were available on a to ta l of 277 workers. The original exposure groups were no longer considered valid because of w orkers tra n s fe rrin g from one exposure c a te g o ry to another. P ersonal m onitoring d a ta c o lle c te d since 1975 w ere th erefo re used to estim ate cu m u lativ e ex p osures in ppm-months for each worker. Mean TWA exposures were calculated for each of six job categories, ranging from 2 to 6 ppb (14-40 Ug/cu m). TDI c o n c e n tra tio n s fo r jobs assigned to the control group were found to be below th e lim it of d e te c ta b ility of th e method (reported as 1.5 ppb) more than 99% of th e tim e , and th e author assigned these jobs a mean TWA concentration of 0 ppb. For each worker, time spent in each job category was multiplied by the mean TWA c o n c e n tra tio n for th a t job and re su lts w ere sum m ed to d e te rm in e cum ulative exposures\n【245】 - Lung fu n ctio n te s t resu lts were statistically correlated with these cumulative exposures in cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses , When re su lts w ere analyzed by sm oking and atopy categories, most of the increase in bronchitis was accounted for by nonatopic smokers in the exposed group. There was no significant d iffe re n c e betw een continuously and interm ittently exposed groups, but correlations with cumulative exposures were not made\n【246】 - This study  is th e only study available on TDI workers that provides preex p o su re d a ta for all w o rk ers. In ad d itio n , because of the use of continuous personal monitoring, it provides realistic information on actual exposures. In a 1973 NIOSH h e a lth h azard e v alu atio n , V andervort and Sham a  in v e stig a te d re s p ira to ry sym ptom s and a c u te lung fu n c tio n ch an g es in workers exposed to TDI a t low c o n c e n tra tio n s a t a p lan t making polyurethane foam ice ch e sts and p icn ic jugs. During a preliminary visit, air samples were collected and analyzed for TDI by th e m odified M arcali m ethod of Grim and Linch . A q u estio n n aire to identify histories of respiratory symptoms was administered to all 290 em plo y ees of th e p la n t, about 200 of them exposed to TDI. The authors did not in d icate th e to ta l num ber of w orkers with respiratory symptoms or describe th e ir exposures to TDI. Twenty-nine of the 200 exposed workers were selected for fu rth e r study; 13 of these were experiencing respiratory symptoms, as indicated in responses to th e q u e stio n n a ire , and 16 were asymptomatic. These workers were subdivided into m o d e ra te and low exposure groups on the basis of environmental m e asu re m en ts m ade a t th e time of the initial visit. The four workers making up th e sym ptom atic low-exposure group were among 14 sensitized workers in the plant who had been transferred away from the immediate area of the foaming operation because of intolerance to TDI. Seven unexposed control employees, m atched to the study group for age, sex, and smoking habits, were selected as controls\n【247】 - Two weeks after the initial visit, the investigators  performed preshift and p o stsh ift pulm onary fu n ctio n te stin g on the exposed and control workers selected for th e study. The TWA exposure concentration of each employee was determined for th e sh ift from breathing-zone samples. Short questionnaires were administered before and a f te r th e m o n ito red sh ift and again th e n ex t morning to determine whether the employees were experiencing symptoms. R esu lts of pulmonary function testing showed no significant difference between m orning and evening testing except in the symptomatic low-exposure group of four s e n sitiz e d w orkers who had been tran sferred out of the foaming area; this group also showed significantly greater decreases in FVC and FEV 1 than did the controls\n【248】 - The individual w ith the g r e a te s t d e c re a se , who had never smoked, was exposed a t a c o n c e n tra tio n of only 0.2 yg/cu m and thus was highly sensitive to TDI\n【249】 - In th e asym ptom atic groups with both moderate and low exposure, all but two of th e w orkers re p o rte d m ild irritatio n of the mucous membranes, and three had re sp ira to ry sym ptom s such as coughing or chest tightness . All 13 workers in th e sy m p to m atic groups reported coughing, chest tightness, wheezing, or shortness of b reath\n【250】 - T here was a considerable increase over preshift findings in the number of sym ptom s re p o rte d a t th e end of th e s h ift in both th e m oderate-and lowexposure symptomatic groups and some increase in the asymptomatic groups. However, the investigators noted that it could not be assum ed th a t w orkers had become sensitized at these low levels. Nine of the 13 sy m p to m atic em p lo y ees had been exposed to spills of TDI in the past, and 8 of th e se 9 developed sym ptom s a t the tim e of th e spill, so sensitization may have developed as a result of these exposures. The authors could not determine whether this was the first occasion on which they showed symptoms. Other studies found on populations of workers exposed to MDI have provided no quantitative information on exposure concentrations, but they do indicate that there is a rela tio n sh ip b etw ee n ad v erse e f f e c ts and exp o su re lev els or d u ratio n of exposure. For ex am p le, in 1971, Tanser et al  examined the effects of MDI exposure on 57 employees in a factory producing rigid polyurethane foam moldings. F o u rte e n of th e 57 w orkers re p o rte d th a t any contact with MDI vapor produced e f fe c ts ranging from a sore throat and wheezing to severe asthma and tightness in th e c h e s t. Spirometric analysis showed that 8 of the 57 employees had an FVC of less than 9096 of the predicted value or an FEV 1/FVC ratio below 75%; only 2 of these 8 reported symptoms of sensitivity to MDI\n【251】 - The authors  reported that most of the symptoms appeared to be those of d ire c t irrita tio n and not of an allergic reaction. However, four workers who had c o n ta c t with MDI were diagnosed as having possible hypersensitivity; three of these had sev ere asth m a, and the fo u rth developed fever, headaches, aching limbs, and cough following exposure\n【252】 - The 1976 stu d ie s of Saia e t al  and F ab b ri e t al  ex p lo red the rela tio n sh ip b etw ee n exp o su re to MDI and ch ro n ic n o n sp ecific lung disease in w orkers in an Italian r e f r ig e r a to r fa c to ry\n【253】 - The total exposed workforce of 180 com prised 94 fu rn a c e w orkers (who removed polyurethane molds from the furnace and w ere e s tim a te d to have the highest exposures), 32 injectors, and 54 assembly line w orkers w ere also included\n【254】 - The groups w ere sim ilar in average age and length of employment\n【255】 - Responses to a questionnaire indicated that 85 of the workers in the plant had re sp ira to ry sym ptom s\n【256】 - The p rev alen ce of th e se sym ptom s was le a st in workers exposed less than years and greatest in those exposed more than 8 years; th e av era g e age in all th r e e groups was 37-38 years. Pulmonary function studies sh o w e d t h a t a b o u t h a lf of th e 180 w o rk e rs had v ital c a p a c ity and FEV 1 m easurem en ts below 90% of predicted values, and 15-20% had values below 80% of p red icted . The 85 workers with respiratory symptoms had pulmonary function m e a su re m e n ts sig n ifican tly low er th an the average for the 180 employees. These measurements decreased with length of exposure even when adjusted for smoking\n【257】 - R esu lts w ere also analyzed by job function in 160 workers who had no history of previous occupational exposure to respiratory irritants . Furnace workers had sig n ifican tly low er pulm onary fu n ctio n values and a g r e a te r prevalence of respiratory symptoms than workers in other jobs\n【258】 - Exposure d a ta w ere not re p o rte d and control groups were not used in these studies  , severely limiting their usefulness. The authors did not reveal the source of d a ta on p re d ic te d pulm onary fu n ctio n values, so it is im possible to determine the relevance of these data to the worker population studied\n【259】 - Only one study, a 1975 NIOSH health hazard evaluation by Hervin and Thoburn  , has been found on w orkers exposed to HDI\n【260】 - These w o rk ers, 18 spray p a in te rs in an airplane repair facility, were exposed to HDI at up to 300 ug/cu m (40 ppb); th ey w ere also exposed to trim e r ic biuret compounds of HDI at up to 3,800 y g /c u m and to a v a rie ty of organic solvents at concentrations above the F ed eral stan d ard s\n【261】 - P ulm onary fu n ctio n m e asu re m en ts in spray painters and the d e c re m e n ts in th e se m e a su re m e n ts over the workshift did not differ significantly from values in 40 controls who worked during shifts when spray painting was never perfo rm e d . All the spray p a in te rs , who wore re s p ira to rs but no eye protective devices, co m p lain ed of eye irritation while painting, and about half complained of nose and th r o a t ir r ita tio n , cough, and c h e st discomfort. The authors mentioned th a t the re s p ira to r program was deficient in many respects. This report suggests th a t MDI produces symptoms similar to those from TDI and MDI. However, it does not provide any in d ic a tio n of th e c o n c e n tra tio n s of HDI that produce irritation, since th e re was sim u ltan eo u s exposure to organic solvents and to trim eric HDI at relatively high concentrations. All th e diisocyanates that have been studied caused irritation when applied directly to th e skin of rabbits or instilled into their eyes. Their potentials as skin and eye irritants, determined from these studies, are summarized in XI M icroscopic ex am in atio n s of tissu e se c tio n s showed tracheitis and bronchitis with sloughing of the superficial epithelium in animals exposed to TDI at 2 ppm and killed by the 4th day a f te r exposure. Lungs of animals killed 7 or more days after exposure did not d i f f e r sig n ifican tly fro m th o se of c o n tro ls, su g g estin g th a t th e e f f e c ts w ere reversible. In animals exposed at 5 or 10 ppm, damage was more severe and longlasting. T h ere w ere a re a s of co ag u latio n necro sis of the superficial epithelium surrounded by in fla m m a to ry cells, and a t points of deep ulceration, connective tissue had developed\n【262】 # Animal Toxicity\n【263】 - B ronchopneum onia developed in all species except mice. Since th e an im als w ere exposed only once, th is lung dam age was the result of irritation rather than an allergic reaction\n【264】 - In an o th er 1962 stu d y , H enschler et al  exposed rats and guinea pigs to TDI repeatedly at concentrations of 0.1-10 ppm (0.7-70 mg/cu m). In rats, three 4hour exposures a t 10 ppm were lethal for all animals; four exposures at 5 ppm or 10 exposures a t 1 ppm w ere le th a l for most rats. At 0.5 ppm, adult rats could w ith stan d 24 exposures, but this exposure regimen killed about half the young rats exposed\n【265】 - Most d eath s w ere due to severe peribronchitis and bronchial pneumonia. In surviving an im als, lung ch ang es w ere rev ersib le within several months. Rats e x p o s e d at 0.1 ppm fo r 40 exp o su res had no ch an g es in th e lungs th a t w ere attributo TDI exposure, but they did gain less weight than controls. In guinea pigs, th e se au th o rs w ere unable to find any evidence of sensitization to TDI after 48 exposures at 0.5 ppm, which was lethal to most of the animals\n【266】 - These results were qualitatively similar to those reported by Zapp  5 years e a rlie r, but H enschler e t al In 1965, Niew enhuis et al  described the effects on animals of repeated exposure to TDI a t a low c o n c e n tra tio n . They exposed rats, rabbits, and guinea pigs to TDI a t 0.1 ppm (0.7 mg/cu m), 6 hours/day for either 38 consecutive days or 5 day s/w eek fo r 58 exposures. Chamber concentrations were measured by the Marcali method\n【267】 - Lung d am age in these animals generally increased in severity for several days a f te r exposure ended\n【268】 - A rabbit examined immediately after exposure had e sse n tia lly norm al lungs, but animals killed 3-10 days later had bronchopneumonia, bronchitis, perivasculitis, and lung abscesses. A rabbit killed after 20 days had only chronic bronchitis. R ats killed immediately had less inflammation than those killed la te r , but fibrous tissue had proliferated in the walls of the bronchioles in several ra ts\n【269】 - At 3-24 days a f te r ex p o su re, in flam m atio n was marked, and animals had bronchopneumonia, extensive fibrous tissue proliferation, and polypoid hyperplasia of th e ep ith eliu m . All control rats had bronchiectasis, which the authors attributed to chronic m urine pneum onia\n【270】 - In guinea pigs, there were localized accumulations of lym phocy tes, m acro p h ag es, and p lasm a cells th ro u g h o u t th e lungs and varying degrees of pneumonitis and bronchopneumonia. No abnormalities of the heart, liver, kidneys, lymph nodes, or spleen were found in any of the animals. R a ts exposed a t th e h ig h est c o n c e n tra tio n gained sig n ifican tly less w eight th an th o se a t the lo w est c o n c e n tra tio n (P<0.05). No sig n ifican t d iffe re n c e s b e tw e e n exposure groups were found in blood composition, liver fu n ctio n , urin aly sis, or kidney fu n ctio n , and no dam age to any organ was observed in m a cro sc o p ic exam inations. However, there was an increased lung-tobody w eig h t ra tio in the high-exposure group. Animals exposed at 1,370 ug/cu m had sig n ifican tly low er liver and spleen weights than those exposed at 250 ug/cu m. The author did not suggest an interpretation of these differences. R esu lts of th e ir 2-hour LC50 studies in mice showed th a t HDI w as 2.3 times as toxic as CHI. The threshold concentration for influence on th e CNS in m ice was 1 mg/cu m for HDI and 10 mg/cu m for CHI, although the th resh o ld c o n c e n tra tio n s for respiratory irritation were sim ilar~2.9 mg/cu m for HDI and 4.5 mg/cu m for CHI. Exposure to CHI caused only a nonsignificant decrease in weight gain\n【271】 - A ccording to th e au th o rs  , adding chlorine to the molecule of an organic com pound would be e x p e c te d to in c re a se th e toxicity of the compound. Yet the resu lts of this series of experiments showed that HDI was substantially more toxic th an CHI. The f a c t th a t th e le th a lity of HDI was dose dependent may indicate th a t the com pound is abso rb ed sy ste m ic a lly , while the effects of CHI appear to result only from local irritation of the respiratory tract. Kondratyev and Mustayev  dem onstrated skin sensitizing effects of HDI in experim ental animals in 1974. Guinea pigs were sensitized by application of HDI in 50% solution in acetone to the skin for 2 days in a row. An initial irritant effect in th e fo rm o f h y p erem ia, ed em a, and itch in g was o b serv ed a t th e s ite s of ap p licatio n . A fter 21 days, the degree of sensitization was determined by applying HDI in various c o n c e n tra tio n s to previously unexposed skin. A specific allergic re a c tio n was seen in most animals at concentrations as much as 40 times less than th e p re v io u s ly d e t e r m in e d th r e s h o l d dose of 50% fo r skin ir r ita tio n\n【272】 - The ep icu tan e o u s sensitization observed was also accompanied by changes in the bloodserum p ro tein fra c tio n s . This study su g g ests that skin contact with HDI in the workplace could lead to allergic derm atitis\n【273】 - Kimmerle  found that IPDI produced moderate skin sensitization in guinea pigs. His e x p e rim e n ta l m eth o d s w ere not described but were said to follow the r e c o m m e n d a tio n s of th e Food and D rug A d m in istratio n\n【274】 - IPDI, a d m in iste re d in tra d e rm a lly , produced a larger area of swelling on reinjection than it had in an earlier injection in all 15 guinea pigs tested\n【275】 - A nim al e x p e rim e n ta tio n has been used in sev eral studies to investigate the m echanism of sensitization to diisocyanates. In 1964, Scheel et al  investigated the immunologic aspects of TDI sensitization. The authors produced TDI antigens by conjugatin g TDI with egg albumin; they attem pted to characterize the antigen, and th e ir m ethod of p re p a ra tio n , w ith m o d ificatio n s, became the standard for many subsequent immunologic studies on TDI. TDI-specific antibodies were demonstrated in ra b b its exposed to TDI by inhalation at 100 ppb (700 Ug/cu m) 6 days/week for 2-4 weeks. When a purified protein derivative of the tubercule bacillus was injected during TDI inhalation, a skin sensitivity response to TDI could also be demonstrated; a n im a ls so t r e a t e d r e a c t e d to 0.001 mg of TDI ap p lied to th e skin, while u n sen sitized anim als r e a c te d only to 0.2 mg. When the proportion of TDI in the an tig en was increased, the antigenicity of the protein was masked so that it would not re a c t w ith an tib o d ies to egg albumin. This dem onstrated that the circulating antibodies contained a reacting group specific for the TDI hapten\n【276】 - Thom pson and Scheel , in 1968, investigated the effects of TDI on rats p re tre a te d with alloxan to suppress anaphylaxis or with insulin and pertussis vaccine to enhance the responses. R ats were exposed to TDI at 1 ppm (7 mg/cu m) for 10 hours. A lthough th e au th o rs found th a t pretreatm ent altered the effects of TDI e x p o s u r e on th e lu n g s in th e p r e d ic te d d ire c tio n , th ey concluded th a t the m echanism of lung damage was not immunologic. This interpretation was based on th e ir in ab ility to e lic it a re a c tio n to cutaneous or intravenous challenge and the f a c t th a t reex p o su re to TDI produced less response than the original exposure. In a d d itio n , m icro sco p ic findings in d ic a te d th a t th e lung e f f e c ts p roduced w ere co n siste n t with chemical damage rather than an immunologic process and that they occurred primarily in the first few days after exposure\n【277】 - In 1970, S tevens and P alm er  stu d ie d sensitization in guinea pigs and rhesus m onkeys exposed to TDI a t 0.01-5 ppm fo r th re e 6-hour periods. Three w eeks la te r, th e se an im als and previously unexposed animals were exposed to TDI a t 20 ppb (140 u g /c u m). B reath in g p a tte rn s of the animals were measured by plethysmography to detect changes indicative of respiratory sensitivity. P a tc h te s ts showed skin se n s itiz a tio n to TDI, but serolog ic te s ts for sensitization were negative. Guinea pigs preexposed to TDI at 0.5 ppm did not show m easurable respiratory changes, suggesting that a threshold for se n s itiz a tio n e x iste d b e tw e e n 0.5 and 2.0 ppm\n【278】 - T h ere was no evidence of se n sitiz a tio n in m onkeys a f te r reex p o su re, and th e re were no serologic changes in d icativ e of sen sitizatio n . The authors concluded that exposure to large amounts of TDI may produce se n s itiv ity to TDI in low er c o n c e n tra tio n s , b ut th a t this sen sitiv ity m ight not involve an allergic mechanism. However, they noted that the d iffic u lty in preparing a suiantigenic system made it impossible to determine whether an immunologic mechanism was involved\n【279】 - K arol e t al , in 1978, were able to dem onstrate the production of serum an tib o d ies sp e c ific for the tolyl portion of an isocyanate molecule. They exposed guinea pigs by in h a latio n to a conjugate of the monofunctional p-tolyl isocyanate w ith egg album in (EA). This antigen induced a respiratory response in the animals beginning ab o u t th e 8th day of exposure, and serum antibodies were detecby gel diffusion and im m u n o electro p h o resis by the 14th day. The authors concluded th a t the antibodies were hapten-specific, since p-tolyl isocyanate that was bound to an o th e r p ro tein c a r r ie r , such as bovine serum albumin, elicited both respiratory re a c tio n s and serum an tib o d y resp o n ses in anim als previously sensitized to the iso cy an a te-E A a n tig e n . In addition, sensitivity to the EA carrier in the conjugate was not produced, suggesting to the authors that the conjugate contained sufficient iso cy an a te m o lecu les to e ffe c tiv e ly shield an tig en ic determinants in the protein m olecule. In a subsequent study, which has been described in Effects on Humans, K arol and her co lleag u es  used this antigen to dem onstrate IgE antibodies in the sera of workers who had sensitivity reactions to TDI, The compounds were tested on Salmonella typhimurium s tra in s TA1535, TA1537, TA1538, TA98, and TA100, with and without a mammalian liver microsome activating system. MDI was mutagenic in strains TA98 and TA100 in th e p resen ce of the liver activating system. The other diisocyanates tested did n o t show m u t a g e n ic a c t i v i t y\n【280】 - D e t a i l s of th e e x p e rim e n ta l p ro c e d u re and quantitative results were not provided\n【281】 # Correlationof Exposureand Effect\n【282】 - In th e e arly days of the industry, a large proportion of the workforce exposed to TDI dev elo p ed re s p ira to ry illn esses The adv erse e f f e c ts of TDI on th e lungs may re s u lt from direct irritation caused by exposure a t relatively high concentrations. An experiment on volunteers  showed th a t one of six subjects experienced irritation of the nose and throat during a 10-m inute exposure at 710 yg/cu m and that all experienced it at 3,600 y g /c u m; however, these subjects did not report chest symptoms. In an automobile p lan t, all 12 w orkers exposed to TDI developed severe respiratory symptoms when TDI c o n c e n tra tio n s w ere 30-70 ppb (210-500 y g /c u m)  . Their symptoms disappeared when concentrations remained below 30 ppb\n【283】 - A cute and ch ro n ic re s p ira to ry e f f e c ts caused by exposure to TDI have been re p o rte d , but the results of such studies have been inconsistent. Results appear to d iffe r su b sta n tia lly depending on th e ty p e of operation or process in which TDI exposure o ccu rs. In a spraying operation, where TDI concentrations reached 6,400 y g /c u m, G andevia  found a significant decrease in FEV 1 during the course of a w orkday in 20 exposed men. This decrease was not fully reversed overnight or on the weekend and the cumulative decrease over 3 weeks was also significant\n【284】 - In a TDI distilling operation where concentrations were generally less than 140 y g /c u m, Williamson Ll7 found no significant changes, compared with preexposure baseline values, in th e pulm onary fu n ctio n of 21 men over 14 months. He also reported little difference between Monday and Friday values\n【285】 - In an o th er ty p e of exposure situation, a polyurethane foam plant, Peters et al  found sig n ific a n t daily, w eekly, and cumulative decreases over a 2-year period in workers exposed at concentrations below about 100 yg/cu m. This study did not include preexposure measurements, but the mean annual decrem ent in FEV 1 of 0.11 lite r /y e a r was con sid erab ly higher than those the authors found in the lite r a tu r e for norm al working and general populations, which ranged from 0.025 to 0.047 lite r /y e a r . A long-term study of workers in a TDI-manufacturing plant, conducted by Weill e t al  and B utcher e t al , showed no significant exposurere la te d changes in lung function. TDI concentrations in the plant generally ranged from 14 to 50 u g /c u m during th e 5.5-year study. The entire study population, which included controls from elsewhere in the chemical factory not exposed to TDI, had ex cessiv e d eclines in som e pulm onary function measurements compared with p re d ic te d values, but th e re w as no d iffe re n c e b e tw e e n groups w ith c o n s ta n t, in te r m itte n t, and no exposure, and decreases were not correlated with cumulative exposures. These findings are questionable on the basis that the control group may h a v e b e e n so a f f e c t e d by e x p o s u re to o th e r ch em ica ls th a t th e study was insensitive to possible effects of TDI exposure\n【286】 - The d isa g re e m e n t of th e se findings with those obtained in polyurethane foam plants  may also r e f le c t d iffe re n c e s in exposure to other chemicals and fa ilu re to detect occasional excursions to much higher exposure concentrations than those usually prevailing. Both TDI manufacturing and polyurethane foam production involve mixed exposures, but in the latter process, exposures to other chemicals are likely to be much m ore closely c o rre la te d w ith exp o su res to TDI. Thus, the ap p a re n t dose-response relationship to TDI exposure in the polyurethane foam plant A t t e m p t s to d e te rm in e th e c o n c e n tra tio n s of TDI n ece ssary to produce sensitization have not been fruitful. Porter et al  reported that there were no new c a s e s o f s e n s i t i z a t i o n in a TDI p la n t in 2 y e a r s w h en a v e ra g e TDI concentrations were below 140 y g/cu m; during the previous 16 years of operation, when TDI concentrations had averaged 350-420 yg/cu m, from one to four cases of s e n s itiz a tio n had been diagnosed each year, the number gradually decreasing with increasin g len g th of o p e ra tio n\n【287】 - Superficially, these data suggest an average TDI exposure, 140 y g /c u m, below which s e n s itiz a tio n does not o ccu r\n【288】 - However, ex am in atio n of the data reveals that, even during the years when the average TDI c o n c e n tra tio n rem ain ed constant at 420 yg/cu m , there was a general decline in the number of cases of sensitization, suggesting that potentially sensitive individuals may have b ecom e sensitized and left the workforce during their early years of em p lo y m en t\n【289】 - Thus, th e se findings do not rule out the possibility that s e n s itiz a tio n might develop in newly hired workers exposed at less than 140 yg/cu m for longer periods of time\n【290】 # S everal au th o rs have noted that workers often become sensitized during brief e x p o s u r e s a t h ig h c o n c e n t r a t i o n s r e s u l t i n g from spills, leaks, or spraying\n【291】 - H ow ever, sensitivity to TDI has been observed in workers with no known exposure to spills or sp raying operations . A NIOSH health hazard survey of a plant making polyurethane foam found respiratory symptoms in workers a t a foam ing o p e ra tio n w here no TDI c o n c e n tra tio n s of more than 35 yg/cu m w ere m easu red  , H ow ever, 9 of 13 workers who had been transferred away from th e foam ing operation because of severe symptoms were known to have been exposed previously to spills of TDI. In another NIOSH survey, none of the nine em ployees of a p o ly u reth an e foam p lan t where TDI concentrations averaged less than 7 y g /c u m and did not exceed 16 yg/cu m had respiratory symptoms , indicating that sensitization may be rare or nonexistent at such low concentrations. O th er stu d ie s sug g est th a t th e rate of sensitization may be som ew hat higher. F our of 47 workers (9%) in an office that received exhaust air fro m a nearby TDI p lan t b eca m e se n sitiz e d ; in 3 of th e se , se n s itiz a tio n was co n firm ed by bronchial responses in challenge tests, and the 4th improved when he was rem oved from exposure . Porter et al  reported that 30 of the 300 w orkers (10%) in a TDI plant were diagnosed as sensitive to TDI during 17 years of o p eratio n\n【292】 - Adams  found that 15% of the workforce in one plant left during th e ir 1st y ear of em p lo y m en t because of effects on their health; 1-3.5% left for th e same reason during subsequent years, for a total of about 20%. A similar rate was suggested in a study by Bruckner et al , in which 5 of 26 workers exposed to u n sp ecified iso c y a n a te s w ere considered sensitized because they had asthm atic reactions at low concentrations. Some re p o rts have suggested that sensitization to TDI is related to a personal history of allerg y  or to atopy, as indicated by reactivity to prick tests with com m on in h a lan t allergens . However, most investigators report that there is no pattern of allergies or atopy in sensitized workers\n【293】 - Several investigators have attem pted to dem onstrate an immunologic mechanism for TDI sensitivity. In 1964, Scheel e t al  dem onstrated circulating antibodies and positiv e skin reactions in guinea pigs sensitized to TDI by inhalation, but later w orkers w ere unable to co n firm th e se re su lts in guinea pigs, rats, and monkeys\n【294】 - In hum ans, im m unologic te stin g has indicated the existence of both re a g in -ty p e an tib o d ies and c irc u la tin g IgG antibodies in some workers exposed to TDI\n【295】 - H ow ever, th e se te s t resu lts have generally correlated poorly with sym ptom s su g g estiv e of TDI sensitivity or with respiratory responses to challenges w ith TDI at low concentrations. Since the TDI molecule has been thought to be too sm all to be a n tig e n ic in itself, a central problem in immunologic testing has been th e d evelo p m en t of an appropriate test antigen (a conjugate of TDI with a carrier p ro tein )\n【296】 - A re c e n t study by K arol e t al  , using a te s t antigen of p-tolyl (m ono)isocyanate, dem onstrated the presence of tolyl-specific antibodies in the sera of th re e of four TDI w orkers who had se n sitiv ity re a c tio n s to TDI; the fourth w orker had not been exposed to TDI for 5 y ears\n【297】 - This study show ed that an immunologic mechanism may be involved in TDI sensitization\n【298】 - S tu d ie s by B u tch er e t al  and Van E rt and B a ttig e lli  have suggested that a pharmacologic mechanism is also involved in respiratory sensitivity to TDI. These investigators showed that TDI inhibited the isoproterenol-stimulated cy clic AMP levels in human lymphocytes. The effect was greater in lymphocytes from individuals who w ere se n sitiv e to TDI F ar less in fo rm a tio n e x ists on exposure to the other diisocyanates, but their e f f e c ts ap p ear to be generally similar to those of TDI. Thirty-four of 35 workers, only 6 of whom w ere exposed to MDI a t c o n c e n tra tio n s above 150 U g/cu m, experienced irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, and half of them had bronchial sym ptom s\n【299】 - W orkers ex posed to MDI a t 50-110 y g /c u m did not have a s ig n ific a n t decrease in FEV 1 during a workshift in which foaming was carried out, but 3 of 29 w orkers had respiratory symptoms . Workers exposed to MDI at unknown concentrations in an Italian refrigerator factory had reduced vital capacity and FEV 1, and 85 of 180 workers had respiratory symptoms . This study in d icate d th a t the e f f e c ts w ere d o s e -re la te d , since fu rn a c e workers, who were exposed to MDI a t th e h ig h est co n ce n tratio n s, had significantly lower pulmonary fu n ctio n values and a g r e a te r p rev alen ce of resp irato ry symptoms than workers elsew h ere in the plant. The incidence of respiratory symptoms also increased with years of employment at the plant. These au th o rs co n sid ered im m unologic cross se n sitiv ity unlikely because of the differences in structure between the compounds. The subjects who cross-reacted to other diisocyanates tended to react to extremely low c o n c e n tra tio n s of TDI (less than 1 ppb) and to be hyperreactive to histamine. The auth o rs suggested that extrem e sensitivity to TDI might be the result of both an immunologic mechanism and a nonspecific pharmacologic or irritative mechanism, w ith th e la tte r m echanism acc o u n tin g for th e cro ss-re actio n s to MDI and HDI. This is co m p atib le w ith th e reports of Butcher et al  th at TDI may block the b e ta-ad ren erg ic system and with the suggestive evidence obtained by Porter et al  th a t TDI sensitivity does not necessarily require the presence of anti-TDI an tib o d ies\n【300】 - H ow ever, th e p o ssib ility of im m unologic c ro ss-se n sitiv ity between diisocyanates remains to be tested with a specific antigen system like that of Karol et al  and is at present only speculative. In th e ab sen ce of other data on mutagenicity, this single study is insufficient evidence that diisocyanates are likely to be mutagenic in humans.   During the startup procedures, the mean weekly TDI concentrations for the synthesis, finishing, and drummming areas were 5.6, 17. Both monitoring methods were used simultaneously during some period eac h day for 22 m onths\n【301】 - When 8-hour TWA values w ere analyzed, no positive c o rre la tio n could be found between personal and area sampling. Area monitoring, then, did not seem to accurately reflect actual individual exposures\n【302】 - H ervin and Thoburn  reported that concentrations of airborne TDI were below the TLV of 20 ppb (140 ug/cu m) in an aircraft overhauling facility where th e p a in te rs sprayed aircraft with polyurethane paints. Area and personal samples w ere analy zed by th e th in -la y e r ch ro m ato g rap h ic method of Keller et al . The c o n c e n tra tio n s of airb o rn e TDI n ear th e aircraft fin, near the wing, on the floor w here mixing was done, and on the floor midway between the two bays were <30, <20-30, 20, and <20 U g/cu m (<4, <3-4, 3, and <3 ppb), respectively. The corresponding concentrations of HDI were 40-100, <30-60, <20-300, and <20 Ug/cu m (6 -1 5 , <4-9, <3-45, and <3 ppb). T h irteen p ersonal sam p les ta k e n a t various o p eratio n s c o n tain ed TDI at concentrations of 40 ug/cu m or less. Corresponding HDI concentrations ranged from less than 30 to 300 Ug/cu m\n【303】 - In an o p eratio n w here polyurethane foam lines were used to make automobile s e a t cusions, B utler and Taylor F itz p a tric k e t al  stated that most of the MDI detected in the air was c a rrie d by this particulate m atter in the reactive form. The reaction of MDI with o th er com ponents of th e foam w as co m p lete w ithin about a minute, or 60 feet downstream from the spraying operation\n【304】 - Dharmarajan and Weill  found that approximately 90% of the MDI present in air during a foam spray operation was blocked by passage through glass fiber or Teflon filters (0.5 pm pore diameter). The percentage blocked was independent of MDI c o n c e n tra tio n in th e ran g e 20-550 p g /c u m, a finding th a t su p p o rts the c o n te n tio n th a t m ost airb o rn e MDI is present in particulate form. Furtherm ore, they found th a t a p p ro x im ate ly 50% of th e p a rtic le s w ere less th an 10 pm in d i a m e t e r\n【305】 - A ssuming th a t all MDI in th e air is in th e form of aero so ls and assum ing an equal collection efficiency for simultaneous sampling of particulates on a f ilte r and MDI in an a b so rb er, th e au th o rs found th a t MDI constituted 3.03-20.34% of the mass of the airborne dust collected on a filter. No m e a su re a b le MDI co n ce n tratio n s were found in 10 s a m p le s from th e mixing o p e ra tio n and 12 from th e m olding o p e ra tio n ; both o p eratio n s are co n d u cted a t room tem perature. Ten samples from the torching or oven-drying operation also showed no MDI, and 17 mold-pouring samples showed less than 7 ppb (70 y g /c u m); these operations involve elevated tem peratures, and the author attributed the low concentrations to the brevity of the operations, which did not p erm it sig n ific a n t vapor concentrations to be generated. The primary objective of engineering controls for operations using diisocyanates m ust be to reduce the concentrations of airborne diisocyanates so that they are at or below th e reco m m en d ed en v iro n m en ta l lim its\n【306】 - P ro cess equipment should be designed so th a t the sy stem is to ta lly en closed and operates, if possible, under n eg ativ e gage pressure  . When it is necessary to open a vessel or when leaks or spills are likely, local ex h au st v e n tila tio n systems should be provided. Unless o th er m eans can be used to control the concentrations of diisocyanates, the source should be f itte d w ith a local exhaust ventilation system  . If a process is too large for this type of enclosure, dilution ventilation may be necessary. N um erous polyurethane products exist, and the polyurethane may sometimes be form ed under circum stances that are not readily adapto conventional exhaust v en tila tio n p ro ced u res, eg, a p p lic a tio n of polyurethane foam to storage tanks to p rev en t co rrosion. Some operations, such as spraying, mixing, foaming, injecting, flushing, pouring in p lace, and painting, can occur either in fixed locations or in the field\n【307】 - W orkers engaged in these operations may require additional protection, such as p o sitiv e p ressu re su p p lied -air re sp ira to rs  and additional protective clothing. Although many types of diisocyanates are used in urethane foam systems, many of th e se system s co n ta in po ly m eric iso cy an ates, which usually have lower  1 8  and Industrial Ventilation-Manual of Recommended P ractice, the 1976 edition  or a later edition\n【308】 - The co n ce n tratio n of diisocyanates in the workplace may also be decreased by s u b s t i t u t i n g a co m p o u n d w ith a low er vapor p ressu re\n【309】 - For ex am p le, w here fo rm u latio n c o n sid e ra tio n s p e rm it, MDI m ight be substituted for TDI . In spraying and certain foaming operations where the diisocyanate is present in aerosol form, this substitution may not be an effective means of controlling exposure\n【310】 - When v e n tila tio n requirements for any diisocyanate work area are determined, and it is established that an exhaust ventilation system is necessary, care must be ta k en in the p la c e m e n t of in ta k e and ex h au st vents . Carroll et al  described re s p ira to ry sensitization from TDI in office workers as a result of TDIcontarninated air being drawn into the ventilation system of an office building from th e exhau st v ents of a neighboring factory using TDI. This report emphasizes the im p o rtan ce of d eterm in in g that intake air for the ventilation system is not drawn from a re a s in w hich o th e r d iiso c y an ate s are handled, and that exhaust vents be positioned to avoid exposure of other persons to the diisocyanate-contam inated air. For less chemically reactive diisocyanates such as HDI , hydrolysis would be e x p e c te d to occur at considerably slower rates. The authors  concluded th a t increased humidity reduces the concentration of atmospheric TDI, but n ot to a d eg ree that would prove useful as a routine control measure in the workplace. A decrease in apparent TDI concentrations due to humidity has also been observed by other investigators\n【311】 # Sampling and Analysis\n【312】 - V olatilized amines may also be presented in workroom air where diisocyanates are being manufactured or used. Toluene diamine, a synthetic precursor to TDI and a possible hydrolysis p ro d u c t, is known to in te r f e r e p o sitiv ely in th e M arcali d e te rm in a tio n of TDI . O th er prim ary arom atic amines would be e x p ec ted to be p o sitiv e interferences with any method in which diisocyanates are determined as secondary reaction products of their amine derivatives\n【313】 - Meddle and Wood  developed a method for detecting arom atic isocyanates in air in th e p resen ce of p rim ary a ro m a tic amines. Individual air samples were bubbled through two different absorber solutions. A solution of dimethylformamide (DMF) and 1,6 -d iam in o h ex an e (DH) was used to trap the primary arom atic amine and inactivate the isocyanate in one air sample. The second air sample was drawn through a solution of DMF, DH, and hy d ro ch lo ric acid th a t tra p s th e primary a ro m a tic am ine and hydrolyzes th e iso cy an a te to its corresponding amine. The sam ples w ere th en diazotized and coupled, and the amount of amine or isocyanate p resen t was d e te rm in e d sp ectro p h o to m etrically using standard calibration curves. The color in th e DMF-DH ab so rb en t solution is produced by the primary amine alone, and th a t in the DMF-DH-hydrochloric acid absorbent solution is produced by both the am ine and th e isocyanate. The amount of isocyanate present in the air sampled was determined by subtracting the former value from the latter\n【314】 - T e rtia ry am ines, such as triethylenediam ine (TEDA), which are often used as c a ta ly s ts in u re th a n e p o ly m eriza tio n s, have been shown to reduce the apparent c o n c e n tra tio n of a irb o rn e TDI . Smith and Henderson  were the firs t to re p o rt the n eg a tiv e interference of TEDA vapors in the determination of gaseous TDI by the Marcali and Reilly tape methods. The fraction of apparent TDI loss, when an aly zed by both m ethods, ranged from 49 to 88%. These results led th e au th o rs to question whether the tape and Marcali values were underestimating actual TDI exposure levels in polyurethane foaming operations. The reported degree of negative interference, however, appears independent of the TEDA concentrations. In additio n , th e ra tio s of TEDA to TDI exam ined, 17-262 , are 135-2,100 tim es th o se th a t m ight be e x p e c te d during actual foaming or spraying operations\n【315】 - In a la te r a tte m p t to elucidate the mechanism of tertiary amine interference, Holland and Rooney  compared values obtained for TDI in mixed TDI-TEDA a tm o sp h eres by th re e analytical techniques: midget impinger sampling and analysis by th e M arcali m ethod, co n tin u o u s-ta p e m onotoring, and direct air-injection gas chromatography\n【316】 - All m ethods gave similar values for TDI, and each showed similarly decreased v a lu e s fo r th e sam e TDI c o n c e n tra tio n in th e p resen ce of TEDA\n【317】 - In c o n tra s t to th e previous report , this study dem onstrated that the reduction in m easu rab le TDI exhibited some dependence on atmospheric amine concentration. A sum m ary of the data shows that, at TEDA-to-TDI ratios of 9.6-25, about 90% of the input TDI could be m easu red ; a t a TED A -to-TD I ratio of 105, only 21-25% could be m easu red\n【318】 - Six o th e r catalysts used in polyurethane manufacturing were s a id to g iv e s im ila r r e s u l t s\n【319】 - The e f f e c t of TEDA on m e asu ra b le TDI was significantly red u ced w hen glass co m p o n en ts of th e experimental apparatus were siliconized to d e c re a se su rfa c e ad so rp tio n\n【320】 - The a u th o rs co m m en te d th a t gas ch ro m ato g rap h y did not detect any sreaction interm ediates, including toluene diam ine, in th e m ixed gas stream . The only reaction product found proved to be the TDI u rea th a t had fo rm ed as a w hite pow der on the surface of the mixing sy stem . The au th o rs  concluded th a t all th re e a n a ly tic a l m ethods gave a c c u ra te m e asu re m en ts of atmospheric TDI in the presence or absence of tertiary am ine c a ta ly s ts and th a t th e o b serv ed n eg ativ e interference reflected an actual reduction in TDI concentration. Furtherm ore, the mechanism by which this reduction o ccu rred may have depended on surface effects, relative humidity, and constituent concentration and residence time\n【321】 - The above re p o rts  su g g est th a t th e p re se n c e of te rtia ry amine vapors may c a ta ly z e th e hydrolysis of airb o rn e TDI to its urea. The reaction ap p ears to be f a c ilita te d by ab so rp tio n of one or m ore of th e re a c ta n ts to a su rfa c e\n【322】 - W hereas gas chromatography of the mixed gases failed to isolate any stab le re a c tio n in te rm e d ia te , th e e x iste n c e of short-lived, potentially toxic, r e a c t i v e c o m p le x e s in m in u te am ounts can n o t be d isco u n ted\n【323】 - Both stu d ies  used concentrations of TDI that may be representative of actual working environm ents, 18-400 ppm; however, since the relative concentrations of amine used far ex ce ed ed re a lis tic le v els, th e re le v a n c e of th e se re s u lts to th e workplace situation remains questionable. The amine is diazotized and coupled with 1-naphthyl eth y len ed iam in e to produce a red d ish -b lu e color\n【324】 - The intensity of this color is m easured spectrophotom etrically at 550 nm to provide an indication of the amount of TDI present. Marcali  reported that the method was capable of detecting 10 ppb (70 yg/cu m) of toluene-2,4-diisocyanate. He also determined that recovery of total TDI was apparently reduced when 35% toluene-2,6-diisocyanate was present. A similar reduction was reported by Meddle et al  for TDI mixtures containing 20 or 40% of th e 2,6-isom er. To increase the accuracy of measuring mixtures of TDI is o m e r s , both M arcali  and M eddle e t al  reco m m en d ed th a t standard curves be constructed with the appropriate isomer ratios. A porfield kit em ploying stab le color standards could easily detect TDI at 50 ppb (360 yg/cu m) and could be modified to detect TDI at 20 ppb (140 y g/cu m). The method does not d e te c t the TDI u re a , 3 ,3 '-d iiso cy an ato -4 ,4 '-d im eth y lcarb an ilid e, a hydrolysis product that is formed on reaction of TDI with water. The Ranta method, as described by Zapp  and Marcali  can measure both TDI and TDI urea with equal efficiency and cannot distinguish between them. The com pounds are collected by bubbling the air sample through a reagent solution of aqueous sodium n itr ite , ethylene glycol monoethyl ether (Cellosolve), and boric acid\n【325】 - The in te n sity of th e resulting orange-yellow color, measured at 450 nm, is proportional to the concentration of either compound\n【326】 - On th e basis of field and la b o ra to ry ev alu atio n s of th e se tw o m ethods, Skonieczny  concluded th a t the Marcali method was more suifor field d e te rm in a tio n of peak c o n c e n tra tio n s and for d e te c tin g sm all amounts of TDI\n【327】 - Because th e R a n ta m ethod req u ire s a sampling tim e of 10-30 minutes to collect su ffic ie n t am ounts of TDI under usual working conditions, Skonieczny noted that it might not detect momentarily high concentrations\n【328】 - In The sensitivity of the method was said to be improved by in creasin g the length of the light path in the spectrophotom etric cells. If amounts of TDI g re a te r th an 70 ppb m ust be measured, the final reagent solution can be d iluted with absorber solution or a smaller air sample can be taken. Although MDI is detected by this method, the time required for complete color development under th e prescribed conditions is 1-2 hours, compared with 5 minutes for TDI . It is possible th a t TDI can be determined in the presence of MDI if the absorbance of the test solution is measured within 10 minutes after adding the coupling agent\n【329】 - Various field te s t kits using th e p rin cip les of the Marcali or Ranta method have been developed\n【330】 - These kits have simplified and standardized test procedures fo r o n -s ite m e a s u r e m e n t\n【331】 - G rim an d Linch  d escrib ed a field kit for d eterm in in g c o n c e n tra tio n s of TDI. Air was sampled through the standard midget im pinger using a self-p o w ered , constant-rate air aspirator. The sensitivity of the field kit employing the Marcali method was improved to allow detection of TDI at 10 ppb (70 Ug/cu m) by co lle c tin g a la rg e r volum e of air and by reducing the volum e of th e reagent used. By increasing the coupling reagent concentration and adding sodium c a rb o n a te to the absorbing medium, the field kit could be used for d e t e r m i n a t i o n s o f a i r b o r n e MDI. The R a n ta m eth o d w as m odified to allow m easurem ent of TDI urea and TDI at concentrations as low as 10 ppb by increasing th e v o lu m e o f s a m p le c o lle c te d , reducing the volum e of re a g e n t used, and in creasin g th e le n g th of th e lig h t path in the colorimeter to 100 mm. To make the R a n ta m ethod su ita b le for field use, color standards that can be used with a porvisual com parator were developed and included in the kit\n【332】 - Belisle  described a field kit suifor measuring TDI in air. Air was sampled at a rate of 0.1 cu ft/m inute through an acidified absorber solution in a m odified m id g et im pinger co n tain in g in situ-generated glutaconic aldehyde and cation-exchange resin. This process converts TDI to its corresponding amine, which re a c ts w ith g lu ta c o n ic ald eh y d e to form an orange-red product. To measure the c o n c e n tra tio n of TDI, th e o ra n g e -re d color th a t appeared on the surface of the resin beads was m a tc h e d a g ain st a set of color s ta n d a rd s\n【333】 - R esults reportedly ag reed closely w ith those obtained by the Marcali method. A major advantage of this m ethod is th a t th e color develops while th e air is being sam pled\n【334】 - At a c o n c e n tr a ti o n of 10 ppb (70 U g/cu m) of TDI, sam pling and analysis can be c o m p lete d in 5 m in u tes\n【335】 - The m ethod is capable of measuring TDI at 5 ppb (35 U g/cu m) in 0.5 cubic fo o t of air, and it may be m o d ified to m easu re other a ro m a tic iso c y a n a te s or a ro m a tic am in es by constructing appropriate calibration data\n【336】 - Reilly  developed a field method for determining MDI in air. The sample was draw n th ro u g h an acid ab so rb er m edium in w hich MDI w as c o lle c te d and hydrolyzed to the corresponding amine. The amine was diazotized and coupled with 3 -h y d ro x y -2 -n ap h th an ilid e to form a pin k ish -o ran g e azo com pound\n【337】 - This was e x tra c te d into ch lo ro fo rm and co m p ared visually w ith in o rg an ic color standard solutions. The method was capable of measuring MDI at 10-40 ppb (100-400 ug/cu m) w ith a 5 -lite r sam p le of air\n【338】 - The eq u ip m en t req u ire d is p o rta b le , and a complete determination can be accomplished in 12-15 minutes\n【339】 - M eddle e t al  ex te n d e d th e G rim and Linch a d a p ta tio n  of the M a rc a li m ethod to a g e n e ra l f ie ld -te s t p ro ced u re cap a b le of d e te c tin g o th e r aro m atic diisocyanates in air. Procedures were described that established maximum sampling and analytical conditions for TDI, MDI, NDI, dianisidine disocyanate, and a polym eric form of MDI, polym ethylene polyphenyl isocyanate. The authors noted th a t, w ith the ex ce p tio n of TDI, attem pts to generate dynamic vapor atmospheres by bubbling dry n itro g en th ro u g h liq u ified d iiso c y an ate s proved u n su ccessful. A irborne co n cen tratio n s produced by this method diminished rapidly indicating that th ese d iiso c y an ate s, w here p re se n t in air, would be in aero so l fo rm\n【340】 - Similar o b serv atio n s w ere m ade by R eilly  in his work with MDI. Analysis of all te s te d d iiso c y an ate s was subsequently performed on generated aerosol atmospheres\n【341】 - A co n seq u en ce of th e aero so l n a tu re of these test atmospheres was the a d o p tio n of a s in te r e d dom e bubbler for air sam pling. To en su re c o m p lete reco v ery , aero so l p a rtic le s tra p p e d in th e s in te re d dom e during sampling were allowed time to dissolve in the absorber solution before coupling reagent was added. A 10-m inute digestion time was judged sufficient under these conditions. Impinger sam pling a t th e sam e flo w ra te of 1 lite r /m in u te w as only 53% as efficient as sam pling w ith the s in te re d dom e bubbler. For use in the field, permanent color standards for MDI, NDI, TDI, and polymethylene polyphenyl isocyanate are available for concentrations of 10-40 ppb\n【342】 - The aerosol nature of MDI in air was further supported by results of a recent study by D h arm arajan and Weill . They found that MDI vapor generated by heating th e d iiso c y an ate to 110 C in a small enclosed room did not behave as a gas but ra th e r as an aero so l\n【343】 - They co m p ared th e am ount of MDI collected in absorbers acco rd in g to th e standard NIOSH-recommended method  with and w ithout p re filte rs and found th a t 98% of th e airb o rn e MDI was collected on a Teflon f ilte r backed w ith a cellu lo se pad and 87% was c o lle c te d on the filter backed w ith a sta in le ss-ste e l pad. Since the collection efficiency of the absorber for MDI aero so l was unknown in this study, it is likely that the actual amount of MDI in sam ples was higher th a n th e am ount d e te c te d\n【344】 - The percentage of the sample consisting of MDI aerosol could also have been underestimated. The authors also poin ted o ut th a t since th e m ajor p o rtio n of MDI in air is p re se n t as an aerosol, concentrations of this compound should be reported in mg/cu m rather than ppm\n【345】 (c) Tape Methods R eilly  dev elo p ed a test-paper method to measure the concentration of TDI in air\n【346】 - A 5 -lite r air sam p le was draw n through a chemically treated filter paper a t a r a te of 1 lite r /m in u te\n【347】 - A fter sam pling was c o m p le te d , stain was allow ed to develop on th e t e s t paper for 15 minutes. The intensity of the stain was then com pared with a set of color standards for TDI concentrations of 10, 20, 40, 60, and 100 ppb (70-700 u g /c u m). The method is specific for the arom atic d iiso c y an ate s, w ith no response o b ta in ed from th e diam ine derivatives. Several p re p a ra tio n s of te s t p ap er, exposed to TDI a t known co n cen tratio n s, showed a v aria tio n in color d ev elo p m en t of ab o u t 20%. Qualitative tests indicate that the m ethod m ay be adap ted to detect MDI and NDI, and it is reported to require less analytical skill to perform than other methods. , th e au th o rs discovered that two midget impingers in series were necessary to tra p airb o rn e TDI adequately. Although the 1973 NIOSH criteria document  s ta te d th a t a \"single bubbler absorbs 95% of the diisocyanate if the concentration is below 2 ppm,\" Miller and Mueller determined that, at TDI concentrations ranging from 1 to 76 ppb (7-532 y g /c u m), the collection efficiency of the first bubbler was approximately 83%\n【348】 - The D unlap/IC I m o n ito r has also been used to measure MDI under laboratory  and field  conditions. Development of tape color intensity in response to MDI, e ith e r as a vapor generated in toluene solution  or when spotted in known concentrations directly on the tape , was approximately 75% of the m axim um when re a d a t 15 m in u tes and th e re a c tio n was complete in 4 hours. Maximum color development with TDI, on the other hand, is complete at 15 minutes\n【349】 - W here MDI may be found as a c o n s titu e n t of a re a c tiv e p a r tic u la te , the a c c u r a c y of th e m o n ito r may be fu rth e r red u ced\n【350】 - In an in itia l t e s t of the applicability of the Dunlap/ICI area monitor in MDI systems, results obtained by the m onitor in foam and p ain t spraying o p eratio n s w ere 36% and 35%, respectively A fte r applying th e m a n u fa c tu re r's recom m en d ed c o rre c tio n factor, the authors found that the values obtained by the ta p e m on ito r a t readings ranging from 1 to 5 ppb (10-50 yg/cu m) were in good agreem ent with those obtained by the spectrophotometric method. D h arm arajan and Weill  assessed the performance of the TDI continuous ta p e m on ito r for an aly zin g both h e a t-g e n e ra te d and foam -spray-generated MDI aerosols. Eight-hour TWA concentrations of MDI in ppb determined by the monitors w ere com p ared w ith th o se o b tain ed by the standard NIOSH-recommended method\n【351】 - In th e range of 5-8 ppb as d e te rm in e d by the NIOSH method, the tape m onitors c o n siste n tly gave read in g s indicating concentrations two to three times higher. The authors  explained this difference by pointing out that, whereas th e filte r ta p e medium of the monitors could be expected to collect 99.9% of the MDI aero so l, an im pinger flo w ra te of 1 liter/m inute would select against certain p a rtic le size populations. The ab so rb er co lle c tio n e ffic ie n c y , however, was not d eterm in e d in this study. H aving em p h asized th e necessity for expressing MDI concentrations in units of mg/cu m, the authors devised a procedure for calibrating th e TDI ta p e m o n ito r for use in MDI aero so ls. C olor in te n sity developed during th is tim e could be correlated with the known concentration of MDI in mg/cu m. However, the authors  did not test the validity of this calibration method in the workplace\n【352】 - In view of these findings , it is important that calibration curves for continuous ta p e monitors used to detect MDI be constructed to simulate as closely as possible the actual conditions under which the monitor will be used\n【353】 - The phenom enon described by a number of investigators , th a t MDI is ra re ly , if e v e r, found as a gas a t a m b ien t tem peratures, has been shown to apply to NDI and dianisidine diisocyanate  and can be considered a general p ro p erty of o th e r diisocyanates that are solids or viscous liquids at room tem perature. The sam pling r a te was lim ited to 1 liter/m inute because at higher sampling rates the toluene in the impinger would bubble over into th e next im pinger in the series and because excessive evaporation of toluene could occur. The authors suggested that 0.1 ml should be the maximum allowable volume for ev ap o ra tio n for one im pinger\n【354】 - This r a te of evaporation would introduce an additional 1% error into the cumulative error for the resultant concentration. The to ta l co lle c tio n e ffic ie n c y of this system was 98%, with the first impinger being 90% efficient\n【355】 - The a n a ly tic a l sy stem co n sisted of a B arb er-C o lm an S eries 5000 Selectra System gas chromatograph equipped with a tritium -source electron-capture detector\n【356】 - A 4 -fo o t P yrex U-tube column (1/4-inch inner diameter) was packed with C hrom osorb G (60/80 mesh) solid support coated with a mixture of Epon 1001 and A piezon L.

This p aire d system of sampling and analysis could accurately analyze TDI in a 1 0 -liter sam p le of dry air at 1.4 ppb (10 yg/cu m). When the system was tested using air that had not been previously dried, readings were lower th a n e x p e c te d\n【358】 - A fter a p p ro p ria te c o rre c tio n s w ere m ade for th e e f f e c ts of humidity , the authors  obtained an overall efficiency of 97%\n【359】 - A th in -la y e r ch ro m a to g ra p h ic (TLC) m ethod was developed by Keller et al  for isolation and quantitative determination of various isocyanate compounds. The m ethod is based on th e re a c tio n of iso c y a n a te s w ith N-4-nitrobenzyl-N-npropylam ine (nitro reagent) to form the corresponding ureas. The concentration of the u reas are then determined. The method is said to be capable of isolating and m easuring diisocyanate monomers in the presence of partially polymerized reaction p roducts\n【360】 - C oncentrations of both monomer and free isocyanate-containing polymer can be determined\n【361】 - Air in th e w orking en v iro n m en t is sam pled with two impingers containing a solution of th e n itro re a g e n t\n【362】 - The solutions in th e im pingers are then com bined and e v a p o ra te d to dryness, and the rem ain in g resid u e is dissolved in benzene. The benzene solution is chromatographically analyzed on thin-layer silicagel p la te s, and ureas are visualized by reducing the nitro groups to amines and by diazotizing the amines with nitrous fumes. After evaporation of the nitrous fumes, the thin-layer chromatographic plates are sprayed with N-l-naphthyl ethylenediamine and qu an titativ e determinations are made by visual comparison of the samples with stan d ard s\n【363】 - Scanning d e n s ito m e try can be used for more accurate determinations. The low er limit for the determinations was found to be 80 yg/cu m for MDI, HDI, and TDI. The method, however, is time consuming and requires skilled attention to detail during the reduction and coupling steps. C h ro m a to g rap h ic s e p a ra tio n of th e u reas was accomplished on a pellicular silica HPLC colum n\n【364】 - As w ith the TLC m ethod  , both a lip h a tic and aro m a tic iso cy an a tes can be analyzed. The HPLC method, however, extended the detection lim its to 5, 5, and 10 y g of TDI, MDI, and HDI, respectively. The values were based on a 20-,liter air sample and a 90-y l injection volume. The method cannot be used to an aly ze a tm o sp h e re s that can oxidize or reduce the nitro reagent used in the impingers during sampling. The report  cited the following reasons for failure: deterioration of silica gel colum ns cau sed by excess nitro reagent in samples; oxidation of the n itro re a g e n t a f te r sam pling; shipping and exposure problems posed by the use of toluen e in th e c o lle c tio n m edium . The time allotted for the study precluded an attem pt to resolve these problems\n【365】 - Two of these difficulties have already been addressed by previous investigators\n【366】 - To elim inate excess nitro reagent in samples, Vogt et al  added p -toly l iso c y a n a te to th e absorbing solution after the collected diisocyanates were allow ed tim e (about 1 hour) to r e a c t\n【367】 - The resu ltin g m onourea derivative was o b s e r v e d to ru n w e ll ah ead of the d iureas\n【368】 - A lte rn a tiv e ly , colum n life was p reserv ed from the effects of excess nitro reagent by daily flushing of the column with solvent. , how ever, ap p e a re d to be a result of insufficient p u rific a tio n of th e sy n th esiz ed n itro re a g e n t and of the grade of toluene used. N itro re a g e n t is now com m ercially available. When the nitro reagent is dissolved in c h ro m a to g ra p h ic -g ra d e to lu en e, absorber solution impurities should be minimal. Com pounds th a t will in te r e f e r e w ith this procedure are those that absorb in the u ltrav io let range and also have the same column retention time as the diisocyanate being investigated. Toluene rem ain s the solvent of choice for this method . Federal reg u latio n s (49 CFR 172) allow air transportation of toluene in quantities of up to 1 q u a rt/p a c k a g e\n【369】 - W here p ersonal sam pling p ro ced u res may expose workers to toluen e vapor for ex te n d e d p eriods, air sam p ler outlets could be fitted with an appropriate scrubber\n【370】 - A fter reviewing the currently available analytical methods, NIOSH recommends the HPLC procedure described above . This method is described in detail in I. Although the method may necessitate some initial experimentation b e f o r e r o u tin e m e a su re m e n ts can be m ade, it is th e m o st se n sitiv e m ethod.

The p ro ced u re has not been tested with diisocyanates other th an TDI, MDI, and HDI. It is reaso n ab le to assum e, how ever, that a method which can e ffe c tiv e ly s e p a ra te th e isom ers of TDI, as does the HPLC method,  can be used su ccessfu lly fo r m easuring o th e r diisocyanates. Where possible in te rfe re n c e from reducing or oxidizing atmospheres may be encountered, a lte r n a te sam pling and a n a ly tic a l m ethods should be calib rated with the HPLC procedure\n【373】 - N um erous stu d ies have shown th a t ab so rb er c o lle c tio n efficiency may vary d ra m a tic a lly . It is therefore recommended that two serially c o n n e c te d im pingers be used for air sam pling u n til a re p ro d u cib le c o lle c tio n efficiency is established for any given operation, after which a single impinger may be used for ro u tin e monitoring. The recommended flow rate of 2 liters/m inute for 10 m inutes re p re s e n ts a co m pro m ise for e ff ic ie n t aero so l and vapor sampling . Diisocyanates are also skin irritants and sensitizers ; how ever, e f f e c ts on th e skin from these compounds do not appear to have been a m ajor problem in in d u stry  . Eye contact with liquid TDI and TDI vapor has produced irrita tio n and watering of the eyes , and it is likely that direct eye contact with other diisocyanates would produce similar effects. D iiso cy an ates en co m p assin g a wide ran g e of molecular weights and physical p ro p e rtie s  are av ailab le for use in industry. The potentials of th e se com pounds to ir r i ta te th e re s p ira to ry trac t, mucous membranes, eyes, and skin vary depending on the particular diisocyanate being considered. The potential for skin irritation and eye injury is generally higher for the lower molecular weight diisocyanates and the severity of these irritant responses is reduced with increasing molecular weight\n【374】 - The potential respiratory hazards encountered during the use of diisocyanates in th e w orkplace are related to their vapor pressures . The lower molecular w e ig h t d iiso c y a n a te s te n d to be m ore read ily v o la tiliz e d into th e w orkplace atm o sp h ere th an th e higher m o lecu lar w eig h t d iiso c y a n a te s  . XI-1 presents graphically the decrease in vapor pressure with increasing molecular weight for sev eral d iiso c y an ate s. The low er molecular weight diisocyanates, such as HDI and TDI, when handled w ith o u t special precautions, can release amounts of vapor su ffic ie n t to be e x tre m e ly irritatin g to the respiratory tra c t of workers . H igher m o lecu lar w eight com pounds such as NDI, IPDI, and MDI present a lesser vapor h aza rd when handled in well-ventilated areas at normal room tem peratures, ie, less than ap p ro x im ate ly 40 C (104 F) for MDI . Although th e vapor pressures of the higher molecular weight diisocyanates are relatively low, they may g en erate vapor concentrations sufficient to cause respiratory and mucous m em brane irrita tio n if th ey are handled in poorly ventilated areas. Air exhaust hoods may be n ecessary under such co n d itio n s  . High m o lecu lar w eight d iiso c y an ate s like MDI m ay also present significant vapor hazards when heated or used in exothermic production processes\n【375】 - The physical s ta te of th e d iiso c y an ate being handled will also a f f e c t the p o te n tia l h aza rd s e n c o u n te re d during its use. MDI and NDI, which are normally solid m a te ria ls a t room tem perature, present less vapor inhalation or skin contact hazard as a re s u lt of sp lash es or spills th an th e low er molecular weight liquid d iiso cy an ates do\n【376】 - H ow ever, w orkers should be aware of the possibility of re sp ira to ry and mucous membrane irritation from the dusts of such compounds, and of c o n ta m in a tio n of th e ir clo th in g w ith the powdered diisocyanates. Operations involving the use of such compounds, such as weighing, should be performed with equipm en t incorporating a barrier between the worker and the diisocyanate. Local ex h au st v e n tila tio n m ay also be n ecessary\n【377】 - C lothing c o n ta m in a te d w ith solid diiso cy an ate should be decontaminated and laundered as soon as possible to prevent fu rth e r exposure of th e w orker and to avoid contamination of other work areas. Spills involving th e se compounds should also be decontaminated and cleaned up as soon as possible\n【378】 - The p ro cesses and o p e ra tio n s in which diisocyanates are used will affect the sev erity of th e h azard\n【379】 - In d u strial p ro cesses involving e v a p o ra tio n from large su rfa c e areas or spraying operations may result in a greater potential vapor hazard than o p eratio n s involving p o u rin g -in -p lace or fro th in g techniques . Special h azard s may arise in spraying operations since the diisocyanate-containing aerosol cloud may drift to areas beyond the immediate spraying area. T he r a t e o f r e a c t i o n is v e ry slo w for TDI and MDI a t te m p e ra tu re s below 50 C\n【380】 - As th e te m p e ra tu re increases, the reaction between th e se com pounds and w a te r becomes more vigorous. TDI and MDI will also react w ith bases, such as sodium hydroxide, am m onia, prim ary and secondary amines, acids, and alcohols\n【381】 - This re a c tio n may be v io len t, producing enough h e a t to in c re ase th e ev o lu tio n of diisocyanate vapor and the generation of carbon dioxide. These re a c tio n s , like th e reactions with water, may lead to dangerously increased pressure in closed c o n ta in e rs  , Thus, containers of diisocyanates should be kept closed as much as possible to prevent water, atmospheric moisture, or other reactive compounds from entering and vapors or solids from escaping\n【382】 - D iiso cy an ates should be transported or stored in sealed, intact containers. A \"sealed co n tain er\" is one that has been closed and kept closed to the extent that th e re is no re le a se of d iiso c y an ate s\n【383】 - An \" in ta c t container\" is one that has not d e te r io r a te d or been dam ag ed to th e e x te n t th a t d iiso c y a n a te s a re rele ased .

If, how ever, c o n ta in e rs a re opened or broken so that diisocyanates may be released, th en all provisions of the recommended standard should apply. Indoor storage areas should be dry, fire p ro o fe d (autom atic sprinkler systems should be considered), and well v e n tila te d ; te m p e r a tu r e e x tre m e s in these areas should be avoided . The sto ra g e a re a should have a firm floor m ade of some nonabsorbent material\n【384】 - If d iiso c y an ate s a re a c c id e n ta lly frozen during storage or while in transit, they may be th aw ed by storage in a warm area . Extreme caution must be used if h e a t is ap p lied , and a flame or similar localized heat source should never be used\n【385】 - D iiso cy an ates are transported in drums, tank trucks, or tank cars. Containers should be properly labeled and shippers should be aware of precautions to be taken fo r tra n sp o rtin g , loading, and unloading th e p a rtic u la r c o n ta in e r and type of diiso cy an ate being tra n sp o rte d . Emergency measures to be taken in the event of an a c c id e n t or some type of damage to the container or tank en route should also be w orked o u t in ad vance by th e shipper and the supplier or producer  , The H a z a r d o u s M a te r i a ls R e g u la tio n s as p ro m u lg ated by th e US D e p a rtm e n t of Transportation in 49 CFR Subchapter C should be adhered to where applicable. W here bulk quantities of diisocyanates are handled, adequate ventilation should be provided and re s p ira to ry p ro te c tiv e eq u ip m en t should be read ily available. W orkers should wear chemical safety goggles when handling solid diisocyanates and chem ical sa fe ty goggles w ith face shields when using liquid diisocyanates. Local exhaust v e n tila tio n should be em ployed when opening containers of diisocyanates\n【386】 - Local ex h au st v e n tila tio n should also be used when performing laboratory operations involving diisocyanates\n【387】 - Since th e flash p o in ts of m ost diisocyanates are high, the compounds are not flam m ab le under norm al circumstances, although they can burn if they are heated su ffic ie n tly\n【388】 - B ecause of th e wide range of physical and chemical properties of d iiso c y an ate s , it is im portant to be aware of the potential fire hazard th a t may be a s s o c ia te d w ith a p a rtic u la r d iiso c y a n a te in the industrial se ttin g in which it is used or sto red\n【389】 - Any diisocyanate involved in a fire may produce high concentrations of toxic vapors, and only trained and properly equipped personnel should be involved in firefig h tin g .

A fter the fire is out, the a r e a should be in sp e c te d by p roperly p ro te c te d p erso n n el, and any su spected residues should be decontaminated before other workers are perm itted to return to the area. If splashes or c o n ta c t w ith aero so ls of d iiso c y an ate s a re likely to occur, em ployees should w ear rubber or polyvinyl chloride gloves and aprons and rubber boots; a p p ro p ria te r e s p ira to ry eq u ip m en t, as d escrib ed in T able 1-1, should be readily available. Where supplied-air respirators are used, the air supply must come from a source not c o n ta m in a te d w ith diisocyanates . For all workers near spray gun operations (within approximately 10 feet), an air-supplied hood, impervious gloves (rubber or polyvinyl chloride), tightly buttoned coveralls, and rubber galoshes or b o o ts a r e n e e d e d\n【390】 - W orkers w ith o u t this eq u ip m en t should not be p e rm itte d close enough to spraying operations performed outdoors to be exposed to d iiso c y an ate vapors or particulates. A minimum of 50 feet is recommended. For indoor spraying operations, the safe distance for unprotected workers will depend on th e ty p e an d e ffic ie n c y of th e v e n tila tio n provided   When leaks or spills of diisocyanates occur, only properly trained and equipped personnel w earing appropriate protective clothing should be perm itted to remain in the a re a\n【391】 - If major spills occur, air-supplied masks or self-contained breathing a p p a ra tu s as described in - Any existing reg u latio n s pertaining to the discharge of such m aterials into sewer lines should be s tric tly a d h ere d to. Since spills of diisocyanates may freeze during cold weather, water and ammonia will merely coat the solid m aterial with insoluble urea, stopping fu rth e r reactions. In cold weather, cleanup should be performed with a mixture of equal p a rts of isopropyl alcohol and e th y len e glycol\n【392】 - A supply of this mixture should be on hand and ready for immediate use in cold weather. B ecause of th e potential hazards of exposure to diisocyanates, the importance of good housekeeping should also be em p h asized\n【393】 - Spills should be cleaned up pro m p tly , and all equipm ent used in the exposure areas, such as buckets, weighing c o n ta in e rs, and funnels, should be decontam inated and cleaned immediately after use\n【394】 - Smoking and th e carry in g of smoking supplies should be prohibited in areas w here exposure to diisocyanates may occur, as should preparing, storing, dispensing (including vending m achines), and consum ing food and b e v e ra g e s\n【395】 - E m ployees exposed to d iiso c y an ate s should be encouraged to wash their hands before eating, d rin k in g , or s m o k in g , an d b e f o r e an d a f te r using to ile t f a c ilitie s . The US D e p a rtm e n t of Labor regulations concerning general sanitation in the workplace as specified in 29 CFR 1910.141 should be adhered to\n【396】 - Em ployees should be instructed on the health hazards of diisocyanates and the p reca u tio n s to be follow ed in handling th em\n【397】 - They should be trained to report prom ptly to th e ir supervisors all leaks, suspected failures of equipment, exposures to d iiso c y an ate s, or sym ptom s of exposure\n【398】 - The location of safety showers and eyew ash fo u n tain s should be c le a rly m arked, and ap p ro p riate warning signs and labels should be p ro m in en tly displayed in exposure a re a s and on containers of diiso c y an ate s. E m ergency ex its should be provided and be accessible at all times. All em erg en cy show er, eyew ash, p ro tectiv e, and firefighting equipment should be checked periodically to ensure its serviceability.   also recommended that this limit not be exceeded because respiratory irritation occurred in anim als exposed to TDI at concentrations of 1-2 ppm. He noted that TDI and sim ilar diisocyanates are strong irritants to the skin, eyes, and gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts and that they may cause asthma-like symptoms in workers\n【399】 - In 1962, th e ACGIH red u ced the TLV for TDI to 0.02 ppm (0.14 mg/cu m) Isocyanates in general were reported to irritate the skin, eyes, and respiratory tra c t and to cau se re s p ira to ry s e n s itiz a tio n when sufficient vapor concentrations were p resen t even for a short time . Konzen et al  observed an immunologic response in w orkers exposed to MIDI a t approximately 1.3 ppm-minute but not in workers exposed at 0.9 ppm-minute. Bruckner et al  noted that workers might becom e se n sitiz e d to isocyanates when exposed at concentrations above 0.02 ppm. A ccording to the 1971 documentation , available data indicated that MDI was sim ilar to TDI in its ir r ita n t and sensitizing properties, suggesting that a similar ceiling value of 0.02 ppm (0.2 mg/cu m) was warranted\n【400】 - In th e U nited S ta te s , o ccu p a tio n a l exposure standards for diisocyanates have been estab lish ed only fo r TDI and MDI. A ccording to th e International Labour O f f ic e  , o ccu p a tio n a l exposure lim its for TDI, MDI, and sev eral o th er d iiso c y an ate s have been s e t by foreign countries. These limits are summarized in s VI-1 and VI-2\n【401】 - C u rre n t Federal standards ,29 CFR 1910,29 CFR .1000  , who re p o rte d th a t w orkers had no sym ptom s at concentrations below 10 ppb but developed resp irato ry illness within 1 week when concentrations rose to 30-70 ppb; when co n ce n tratio n s were reduced to 10-30 ppb, there were no further complaints. The recom m en d ed ceiling was intended to protect against irritative effects of TDI in non sen sitized w orkers, but ev id en ce was insufficient to determ ine whether it would also protect against sensitization. The document noted that no evidence was available to point to a concentration of TDI that would be safe for workers already s e n sitiz e d to TDI. The present document reexamines the earlier recommendations for a TDI stan d ard , taking into account more recent information that has become available since 1973.   No th resh o ld concentration for such reactions has b e e n id e n tif ie d , but th e re is ev id en ce th a t, for som e individuals, it may be u nm easurably low ; th u s, it is not possible at this time to establish a level below which sensitized workers will not experience adverse respiratory effects from exposure to diisocyanates\n【402】 # Basisforthe Recommended Standard\n【403】 - Several studies have shown that 5-20% of the workforce may become sensitized to d iiso c y an ate s . There is evidence, however, that the incidence of s e n sitiz a tio n can be red u ce d by co n tro llin g exposures. The data of Elkins et al  on 15 TDI plants showed that all plants where average exposures exceeded 70 y g /c u m had w orkers w ith T D I-re la te d re s p ira to ry illness, but no such illnesses w ere re p o rte d in p lan ts where average exposures were 50 yg/cu m or lower. On th e o th e r hand, Weill  reported instances of sensitization developing in a plant w here av era g e TDI ex posures ran g ed from 14 to 50 yg/cu m. These studies did not re p o rt th e frequency or magnitude of excursions above these averages, so that the more precise estim ates of exposure concentrations cannot be determined. Exposure to diisocyanates may also cause chronic respiratory effects measurable as lo n g -term decrem ent in pulmonary function, especially FEV 1, in excess of that expected from aging. It is not clear from existing data whether this change occurs only in se n sitiz e d w orkers or w h eth er it may also a f f e c t workers who show no clinical sym ptom s from diisocyanate exposure. The findings of Porter et al  in d ic a te th a t som e w orkers who are sen sitiv e to TDI and who have anti-T D I an tib o d ies may ex h ib it norm al pulm onary fu n ctio n , w hile o th e rs w ith clin ical sym ptom s of s e n s itiz a tio n but n eg ativ e re su lts on im m unologic tests may have sev erely im p aired pulm onary fu n ctio n\n【404】 - In the study conducted by Wegman et al  , in w h ich w orkers exposed a t c o n c e n tra tio n s above 20 U g/cu m had a significantly greater decrease in FEV 1 than those exposed at lower concentrations, th e w ork fo rce studied included both sensitized and unsensitized individuals. In the plant studied by Weill and colleagues , where workers who showed symptoms of clin ica l sensitization were not included in the study population, the investigators found no sig n ifican t e f f e c ts on lung function related to TDI exposures at average c o n c e n tra tio n s of 14-50 ug/cu m. These findings indicate that the TWA limit of 5 ppb (35 U g/cu m) for TDI recommended by NIOSH in 1973 , which was based on th e findings of Elkins et al , provides adequate protection against chronic effects of TDI on pulmonary function of workers who are not sensitized. E nv iro n m en tal d a ta for the other diisocyanates are insufficient to establish a safe exposure lim it\n【405】 - The diisocyanates commonly used in industry are respiratory irrita n ts  . In a plant where area samples showed MDI concentrations of 10-150 U g/cu m and breathing zone concentrations for 6 sprayers were 120-270 ug/cu m, 34 of 35 workers had eye, nose, or throat irritation, and nearly half had wheezing, sh o rtn ess of b re a th , and ch est tightness . In another plant, 3 of 29 workers exposed to MDI a t 50-110 ug/cu m had respiratory symptoms . Nine of 18 w orkers exposed to HDI a t less th a n 300 Ug/cu m and to an HDI trim er at less than 3,800 ug/cu m had irritatio n of the upper respiratory trac t, cough, or chest tightness , 100 j\n【406】 - L ik e TD I, o th e r d i i s o c y a n a t e s a r e likely to be re a c tiv e w ith biologic m acrom o lecu les, such as proteins, and thus are potential sensitizers. Some authors  have re p o rte d th a t MDI produces respiratory sensitization, since affected w orkers gave p o sitiv e re su lts in immunologic tests. The assumption of a common m echanism of a c tio n suggests that structurally similar diisocyanates might produce cross-sensitization; there is one report  of positive tests for antibodies against MDI in w orkers sen sitized to TDI, but the validity of these results is questionable because of th e lack of characterization of the test antigen used. A study of skin s e n s itiz a tio n  su g g ested th a t w orkers exposed to TDI and MDI were cross sen sitized to IPDI. In an o th e r study , some workers with previous exposure only to TDI had bronchial reactions to MDI and HDI as well. These workers were sig n ifican tly m ore h y p e rre a c tiv e to h ista m in e th a n workers who reacted to TDI only, suggesting th a t c ro s s -re a c tiv ity m ight involve a nonspecific pharmacologic mechanism\n【407】 - The p re d ic te d r e a c tiv ity of the diisocyanates with biologic macromolecules is th e probable basis for th e ir im m unologic effects and perhaps for the respiratory sym ptom s and effects on pulmonary function produced at low concentrations. It is th e re fo re reasonable to expect that other diisocyanates react similarly to TDI on a molar basis. In th e absence of data indicating that any of the diisocyanates is substantially less to x ic th an TDI, th e exposure concentrations recommended in 1973 should be ex ten d ed to all diisocyanates. It is recommended that exposure to the diisocyanates be c o n tro lle d so th a t no em p lo y ee is exposed at concentrations in excess of the following environmental limits, equivalent, in the case of volatile diisocyanates that o c c u r as v a p o r s , to a TWA lim it of 5 ppb fo r a 10-hour w o rk sh ift, 40-hour workweek, and a ceiling limit of 20 ppb for a 10-minute sampling period:\n【408】 - TWA G e i1ing  The recom m ended method also permits separation of different diisocyanates in th e sam e sam ple\n【409】 - It has not been tested with diisocyanates other than TDI, MDI, and HDI, b u t, w ith a p p ro p ria te m o d ificatio n s and so lv en t systems, it should be capable of detecting these compounds in the same range\n【410】 - The reco m m en d ed m ethod fo r sam pling a irb o rn e d iiso c y a n a te s consists of draw ing air a t a r a te of 2 lite rs /m in u te for 10 m in u tes th ro u g h tw o serially co n n ec ted a ll-g la ss m idget impingers, each containing 15 ml of absorbing solution. The use of tw o im pingers in series is n ece ssary u n til a reproducible collection efficiency is established for any given operation, since absorber collection efficiency is highly variable . The diisocyanates react with the absorbing solution to form s p e c ific u re a d eriv ativ es which are then injected into the high speed liquid ch ro m a to g ra p h for an alysis. The m eth o d is described in detail in I. To p re v e n t d ev elo p m en t of serious re s p ira to ry sym ptom s, a medical su rv eillan ce program should provide for th e tim ely d e te c tio n of adverse health effects that develop from exposure to diisocyanates. E m ployees w ith a h isto ry of respiratory illness, especially asthma, and those exposed to o th e r re s p ira to ry ir r ita n ts , eg, smokers, may be at increased risk of developing ad v erse h e a lth effects from exposure to diisocyanates, and they should be counseled on this risk. All employees should be monitored so that work-related sym ptom s or loss of pulm onary fu n ctio n can be detected early. Employees who d e v e lo p s y m p to m s o f TDI s e n s itiz a tio n should be co u n seled on th e risks of continuing to work with TDI\n【411】 - Each em p lo y ee should re c e iv e a thorough preplacement medical examination, which includes a h isto ry of exposure to diiso cy an ates, a smoking history, and a history of re s p ira to ry illnesses. Each employee should receive pulmonary function te s ts , including FEV 1 and FVC, and a chest X-ray before beginning work in any p lan t m a n u fa ctu rin g or using d iiso c y a n a te s. F o r em p lo y ees w ith occupational e x p o s u re to d iiso c y an ate s, physical ex am in atio n s should be re p e a te d a t le a st annually\n【412】 - B ecause of seaso n al and diurnal variations in pulmonary function, the periodic e x am in atio n of an individual employee should be performed at about the sam e tim e ea c h y ear and at the same time of day, so that changes in respiratory function can be evaluated. Chest X-rays are not required at periodic examinations, and should be re p e a te d a t th e d isc re tio n of the examining physician. Records of m edical examinations should be kept for at least 30 years after the employee's last exposure to diisocyanates\n【413】 - The previous NIOSH criteria document on TDI  recommended a leukocyte count w ith d iffe re n tia l as p a rt of th e p re p la c e m e n t m ed ical ex am in atio n and su g g ested p erio d ic eosinophil counts. However, there is no evidence at this time th a t blood findings a re a significant indicator of adverse effects of TDI exposure. This change in the recommendations for the medical examination is consistent with th e fa ilu re to find eosin o p h ila in T D I-sen sitized individuals in re c e n t stu d ies . W here liquid diisocyanates may be present on floors, protective shoe coverings should be worn\n【414】 - If th e p o te n tia l e x ists for splashes or contact with aerosols of diisocyanates, em ployees should be provided w ith face shields (20-cm minimum) with goggles, rubber or polyvinyl ch lo rid e gloves and aprons, rubber b oots, and ap p ro p riate re s p ira to ry eq u ip m en t as d escrib ed in -1. Because diisocyanates have poor w arning properties , the use of chemical cartridge respirators or gas masks is not recommended. At present, air-purifying respirators with an end-of-service-life in d icato r a re not available for the diisocyanates. Demand-type (negative pressure) supplied-air respirators are not recommended because of the possibility of facepiece leakage. Workers within 10 feet of a unit spraying m aterial containing diisocyanates should w ear full-body p ro te c tiv e clo th in g and appropriate respiratory protective devices\n【415】 - All protective clothing th at becomes contaminated with diisocyanates should be rep la ced or thoroughly decontaminated in a solution of 8% ammonia and 2% liquid d e te rg e n t in w ater and clean ed b efo re reu se\n【416】 - L ockers should be provided for w orkers so th a t work and s tr e e t clothes can be stored separately. The employer should arran g e for laundering of all work clothes and ensure that laundry workers are aware of the hazards of exposure and appropriate safety precations\n【417】 # Informing Employeesof Hazards\n【418】 - At the beginning of em p lo y m en t, all em p lo y ees should be informed of the h azard s from exposure to diisocyanates. Brochures and pamphlets may be effective aids in informing employees of hazards. In addition, signs warning of the danger of exposure to diisocyanates should be posted in any area where occupational exposure to the diisocyanates is likely. Access to areas of potential high exposure should be re s tr ic te d to em p lo y ees equipped with appropriate protective gear. A continuing ed u ca tio n program, which includes training in the use of protective equipment such as respirators and information about the value of the periodic medical examinations, should be available to the employees. Employees exposed to diisocyanates should be inform ed th a t symptoms of exposure, such as nocturnal dyspnea, may occur several hours a f te r th e end of the workshift. Because of the possibility of sensitization to th e d iiso c y an ate s, em p lo y ees should be w arned th a t the im proper home use of po ly u reth an e p ro d u cts, such as foam kits and varnishes, that contain diisocyanates may in c re a se th e ir risk of developing w o rk -re la te d h e a lth problems. Employees should be in s tru c te d in th e ir own responsibility for following work practices and sa n ita tio n p ro ced u res to help p r o te c t th e h ealth and p rovide for the safety of themselves and their fellow employees. T hese sy stem s should be designed to p re v e n t th e a c c u m u la tio n or re c irc u la tio n of d iiso c y a n a te s in the w orkplace en v iro n m en t and to effectiv ely remove diisocyanate vapors or aerosols from th e b reath in g zone of th e em p lo y ees\n【419】 - The v e n tila tio n systems should be periodically ch eck ed , including airflow measurements, to ensure that the systems are w orking p ro p erly\n【420】 - Exhaust ventilation systems discharging to outside air must conform to ap p licab le lo cal, state, and Federal air pollution regulations and must not constitute a hazard to employees or to the general public. In ad d itio n, it is recom m en d ed th a t em ployees who work in areas that use diisocyanates wash their hands thoroughly b efo re e a tin g or using to ilet facilities. Smoking should not be perm itted in areas where diisocyanates are stored or used because of the possibility that smoking materials may become contaminated with diisocyanates\n【421】 # Monitoringand Recordkeeping Requirements\n【422】 - In ad d itio n to a program of regular personal monitoring of air concentrations, continuous a re a m o n ito rin g is strongly recommended where aliphatic diisocyanates such as TDI and MDI are p re se n t\n【423】 - This will p e rm it engineering controls to be m odified or im proved to keep the concentrations of diisocyanates at or below the recom m en d ed lim its\n【424】 - M onitoring should also be perform ed whenever there is a c h a n g e in th e pro cess or m a te ria ls used th a t could in c re a se th e exposure of employees\n【425】 - Em ployers should m onitor exposure of employees to diisocyanates by taking a s u ffic ie n t num ber of b reath in g -zo n e samples to adequately characterize exposures for every o p eratio n . In determining the sampling strategy for a particular worker, th e process and the job description of the worker should be considered, and those p ro cess cy cles in w hich p o te n tia l exposure is g r e a te s t should be given prim e consideration. R eco rd s should be kept for all sampling operations and should include the type of personal p ro te c tiv e d ev ices in use, if any, and th e sam pling and analytical m ethods used. Employees or their designated representatives should have access to records of their own environmental exposures. These records should be kept at least 30 years after the employee's last exposure to diisocyanates\n【426】 # VII. RESEARCH NEEDS\n【427】 - In fo rm atio n needed to develop a stan d ard for occupational exposure to the diisocyanates is incomplete in many respects. It has been necessary to recommend a stan d ard for th e d iiso c y a n a te s based on sim ila ritie s to TDI and MDI, since ad eq u a te in fo rm atio n is not av ailab le on other diisocyanates to dem onstrate that they differ appreciably in their toxicity, These relationships could be studied in guinea pigs exposed to TDI, using the p-tolyl isocyanate antigen  to test for th e in d u ctio n of tolyl-specific antibodies. Sera from these animals should not be pooled, so that the standard deviation can be determined. Changes in respiratory response in exposed animals should also be evaluated to determine their correlation w ith th e ap p e a ra n c e of IgE or IgG antibodies. As a corollary experiment, animals should be exposed at the same total dose administered over varying tim e periods to sim u late the e f f e c ts of excursions while retaining the same 8-hour TWA exposure; eg, groups of anim als m ight be exposed a t 5 ppb fo r 8 hours, 160 ppb for 15 minutes, and 2,400 ppb for 1 minute\n【428】 - To im prove p ro te c tio n of exposed w orkers, it is p a rtic u la rly desirable to d e te rm in e w h eth er th ere are intrinsic, predicdifferences between sensitizable and nonsensitizable individuals. The studies of Butcher et al , showing that persons se n sitiz e d to TDI tend to be hyperreactive to bronchoconstrictors such as m echolyl, ap p ear to o ffe r prom ise in this reg ard\n【429】 - It is necessary to determine w hether this h y p e rre a c tiv ity is a re su lt of exposure or a preexisting factor that may in d ic a te a p red isp o sitio n to become sensitized to diisocyanates. Methods of id en tify in g sensitized individuals before overt chronic symptoms develop should also be explored\n【430】 - The value of m e asu re m en ts of eosinophilia and cyclic AMP and of pulm onary fu n ctio n stu d ies and immunologic testing as diagnostic tools should be c a re fu lly e v a lu a te d , since ex istin g re p o rts of their usefulness are contradictory. The p-to ly l iso c y a n a te te s t an tig e n developed by Karol and her colleagues  ap pears to be a p a rtic u la rly useful d iag n o stic tool for TDI se n s itiz a tio n , and analogous an tig en s should be developed for in v e stig a tin g sensitization to other diisocyanates\n【431】 - B ecause th e d iiso cy an ates may be highly reactive biologically, it is important th a t th e ir p o te n tia l to cau se carcinogenic and mutagenic effects be investigated. M u tag en icity screen in g in m icro b ial te s ts should be c a rrie d o u t, using a te s t p ro to co l th at will decrease the likelihood of hydrolysis to possibly mutagenic amine in te rm e d ia te s\n【432】 - D iiso cy an a tes, esp ecially those that are positive in mutagenicity te s ts , should also be te s te d for carcinogenicity in animal experiments. Studies of absorptio n , distribution, metabolism, and excretion of diisocyanates are also needed to elucidate the mechanism of their action\n【433】 - The co n seq u en ces of ex p o su re to the aerosols produced in many diisocyanate ap p licatio n s, such as sp ray in g , should also be investigated. It has been assumed th a t re a c tiv e diisocyanates in aerosol form produce the same biologic consequences as d iiso c y an ate vapors a t eq u iv alen t c o n c e n tra tio n s. This assumption should be e x p e rim e n ta lly v e rifie d\n【434】 - S im ilarily, m ost a p p lic a tio n s of diisocyanates involve sim u ltan eo u s exp o su re to o th e r to x ic ch em ica ls, and in a d e q u a te information is av ailab le on th e ro le of th e se ch em icals in producing observed health effects in diisocyanate workers and their possible additive or synergistic nature. R eliab le, se n sitiv e continuous monitoring methods should be developed for all th e diisocyanates. The paper-tape method developed by Reilly  is a valuable m ethod for continuous m onitoring of the arom atic diisocyanates, particularly TDI. C om parab le m ethods a re need ed for other diisocyanates to protect workers from dangerous ex cu rsio n s and to provide better information relating health effects to actual exposures. The following items of information that are applicable to a specific product or m a te ria l shall be provided in th e a p p ro p ria te block of the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS)\n【435】 - The product designation is inserted in the block in the upper left corner of the firs t page to facilitate filing and retrieval.

These data are useful for the control of toxic su b stan ces\n【442】 - Boiling point, vapor d en sity , p e rc e n t volatiles, vapor pressure, and ev ap o ratio n are useful for designing proper ventilation equipment. This information is also useful for design and d eploym ent of adequate fire and spill containment eq u ip m en t. The ap p e a ra n c e and odor may facilitate identification of substances stored in improperly marked containers, or when spilled\n【443】 # (d)\n【444】 - IV.

APPENDIX I SAMPLING AND ANALYTICAL METHOD FOR DIISOCYANATES IN AIR\n【458】 - The follow ing m ethod for sam pling and analysis of airborne diisocyanates is ad ap ted from NIOSH M ethod No. MR 240 (C la ssific a tio n E) . A Class E m ethod is defin ed by NIOSH as \"Proposed: A new, unproven, or suggested method not previously used by industrial hygiene analysts but which gives promise of being suifor the determination of a given substance.\"\n【459】 # Principle of the Method\n【460】 - A known volum e of air is drawn at a flowrate of 2 liters/m inute through two m idget gas im p in g ers, c o n n e c te d in se rie s, containing the nitro reagent absorber solution. The recommended airflow is 2 liters/m inute, rather than 1 liter/m inute as in d i c a t e d in M eth o d N o. MR 240  , to en su re c o lle c tio n of p a rtic u la te diisocyanates. At the time of analysis, the two impinger solutions are initially kept s e p a ra te to allow d e te rm in a tio n of collection efficiency. The impinger solutions (s e p a ra te or com bined) are carefully rotary evaporated to dryness. The residue is then dissolved in 1.0 ml of m eth y len e ch lo rid e, CH2C12, containing an internal stan d ard\n【461】 - An aliquot of the solution is injected into a liquid chromatograph. The a r e a of the re su ltin g peak is d e te rm in e d and co m p ared to a re a s o b ta in ed by injecting standard urea solutions of known concentration\n【462】 # Range and Sensitivity\n【463】 - The upper lim it of th e range of the method depends on the concentration of th e nitro reagent in the midget gas impingers. For a 10-liter air sample, the limit of d iiso c y an ate s th at can be absorbed is 0.0015 millimole/cu m using 15 ml of 0.2 mM nitro reagent solution\n【464】 - T he m inim um d e te c ta b le lim it is 2 n g /in je c tio n fo r TDI and MDI and 5 n g /in jectio n for HDI. The advisable injection volume is 50 pi. Hence, for a 20lite r sam ple, th e usefu l range is 2-300 p g /c u m of to ta l d iiso c y a n a te s.

The peak area is measured by peak height times peak width at half the height or by an e le c tro n ic integrator such as a computing integrator. Preliminary results are read from a standard curve prepared as discussed below\n【488】 # Calibration and Standards (a)\n【489】 - A series of standards varying in concentration over the range of interest are prepared. Calibration curves are established prior to sample analysis each day. When an in te rn a l standard is used, the analyte concentration is plotted against the area ratio of the analyte to that of the internal standard\n【490】 - The follow ing w eights of th e isocyanates are dissolved in 4.0-ml portions of CH2C12: 2.12 mg MDI; 29.60 mg of TD1 (ie, 19.30 mg of 2,4-TDI and 10.30 mg of 2,6-TDI), 21.14 mg of HDI\n【491】 - Then 755 y l of MDI, 83.1 y l of TDI, and 75.5 y l of HDI are m ixed and 1.017 ml CH2C12 is added to make a total of 2.00 ml (200 ng/liter of each).

Its primary function is preventing the absorption of fats from the human diet, thereby reducing caloric intake. It is intended for use in conjunction with a physician-supervised reduced-calorie diet\n【3】 - Orlistat is the saturated derivative of lipstatin—a potent natural inhibitor of pancreatic lipases isolated from the bacterium Streptomyces toxytricini. However, due to simplicity and stability, orlistat rather than lipstatin was developed into an anti-obesity drug\n【4】 # Pharmacology\n【5】 - Orlistat works by inhibiting pancreatic lipase, an enzyme that breaks down triglycerides in the intestine. Without this enzyme, triglycerides from the diet are prevented from being hydrolyzed into absorbable free fatty acids and are excreted undigested. Only trace amounts of orlistat are absorbed systemically; the primary effect is local lipase inhibition within the GI tract after an oral dose. The primary route of elimination is through the feces\n【6】 - At the standard prescription dose of 120 mg three times daily before meals, orlistat prevents approximately 30% of dietary fat from being absorbed, and about 25% at the standard over-the-counter dose of 60 mg. Higher doses do not produce more potent effects\n【7】 # Efficacy\n【8】 - The amount of weight loss achieved with orlistat varies. In one-year clinical trials, between 35.5% and 54.8% of subjects achieved a 5% or greater decrease in body mass, although not all of this mass was necessarily fat. Between 16.4% and 24.8% achieved at least a 10% decrease in body mass. After orlistat was stopped, a significant number of subjects regained weight—up to 35% of the weight they had lost. Despite this relatively small body mass effect, there was a 37% reduction in the incidence of type 2 diabetes, a significant difference. This study (XENDOS) proved that the side effect profile of orlistat remained the same up to 4 years. Respondents who lost 5% of their initial body weight in the first three months plus 2.5 gm in the first 4 weeks prior to the study, lost 16.4% of their weight at the end of one year\n【9】 # Side effects\n【10】 - The primary side effects of the drug are gastrointestinal-related. According to Roche, side effects are most severe when beginning therapy and may decrease in frequency with time.  Because orlistat blocks some of the dietary fat from being absorbed, the fat is excreted unchanged in the feces\n【11】 - Known side effects include:\n【12】 - steatorrhea - meaning oily, loose stools,\n【13】 - fecal incontinence,\n【14】 - frequent or urgent bowels,\n【15】 - flatulence\n【16】 - The manufacturer website of alli recommends to users \" Until you have a sense of any treatment effects, it's probably a smart idea to wear dark pants, and bring a change of clothes with you to work.\" To minimize these effects, foods with high fat content should be avoided; the manufacturer advises consumers to follow a low-fat, reduced-calorie diet. Oily stools and flatulence can be controlled by reducing the dietary fat content to somewhere in the region of 15 grams per meal, and it has been suggested that the decrease in side effects over time may be associated to long-term compliance with a low-fat diet\n【17】 - Because of this side effect, the US consumer group, Prescription Access Litigation (PAL) awarded its first 2007 Bitter Pill Award to GlaxoSmithKline  for alli, the 'With Allies Like This, Who Needs Enemas?' Award\n【18】 ## Long term side effects\n【19】 - Despite a higher incidence of breast cancer amongst those taking orlistat in early, pooled clinical trial data—the analysis of which delayed FDA review of orlistat—a two-year study published in 1999 found similar rates between orlistat and placebo (0.54 versus 0.51%), and evidence that tumors predated treatment in 3 of the 4 participants who had them. There is evidence from an in vitro study to suggest that the introduction of specific varied preparations containing orlistat, namely the concurrent administration of orlistat and the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab, can actually induce cell death in breast cancer cells and block their growth\n【20】 - A 2006 animal study linked orlistat with aberrant crypt foci (ACF), lesions found in the colon which are believed to be one of the earliest precursors of colon cancer\n【21】 # Precautions\n【22】 - Absorption of fat-soluble vitamins and other fat-soluble nutrients is inhibited by the use of orlistat. A multivitamin t containing vitamins A, D, E, K, and beta-carotene should be taken once a day, at least 2 hours before or after taking the drug\n【23】 # Interactions\n【24】 - Orlistat may reduce plasma levels of ciclosporin (also known as \"cyclosporin\" or \"cyclosporine\", trade names Sandimmune, Gengraf, Neoral, etc.), an immunosuppressive drug frequently used to prevent transplant rejection; the two drugs should therefore not be administered concomitantly. Orlistat can also impair absorption of the antiarrhythmic amiodarone\n【25】 # Contraindications\n【26】 - Orlistat is contraindicated in:\n【27】 - Malabsorption\n【28】 - Hypersensitivity to Orlistat\n【29】 - Reduced gallbladder function (e.g. after cholecystectomy)\n【30】 - Pregnancy and breastfeeding\n【31】 - Use Caution with: Obstructed bile duct, impaired liver function, and pancreatic disease\n【32】 # Availability\n【33】 - In most areas, such as the United Kingdom, France, and Canada, orlistat is available by prescription only. In Australia and the United States, certain formulations of orlistat have been approved for sale without a prescription\n【34】 ## Australia\n【35】 , to discuss possible revoking of orlistat's over-the-counter status. The Committee ultimately decided to keep orlistat as a Schedule 3 drug, but withdrew its authorization of direct-to-consumer Xenical advertising, stating this \"increased pressure on pharmacists to provide orlistat to  in turn had the potential to result in inappropriate patterns of use\". Xenical has recently began being advertised direct-to-customers again\n【36】 ## United States\n【37】 , and allī became the first weight loss drug officially sanctioned by the U.S. government for over-the-counter use\n【38】 - Consumer advocacy organization Public Citizen, through its Health Research Group, opposed over-the-counter approval for orlistat, calling it \"the height of recklessness\" and \"a dangerous mistake\" due to questionable benefits and possible adverse effects\n【39】 - Allī became available in the U.S. in June of 2007. It is sold as 60 mg capsules—half the dosage of prescription orlistat\n【40】 ## European Union\n【41】 - In the EU GSK is currently seeking approval for the sale of Orlistat over the counter, through the European Medicines Agency\n【42】 ## Generic formulations", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": "多余标点#17#17#Who Needs Enemas? ’ Award", "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-15 17:51:30", "update_time": "2024-04-15 21:09:48"}

The Commission on Narcotic Drugs was established by the UN Economic and Social Council in 1946, with Canadian Charles Henry Ludovic Sharman as its first chair. The Commission has important functions under the drug control treaties in force today. Most notably, it can amend the Schedules of controlled substances\n【3】 # Powers\n【4】 - The drug control treaties divide power between the Commission and the International Narcotics Control Board. The Commission has power to influence drug control policy by advising other bodies and deciding how various substances will be controlled. However, enforcement power is reserved to the Board\n【5】 - Under Article 8 of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, the Commission's powers are to:\n【6】 - Amend the Schedules;\n【7】 - Call the attention of the International Narcotics Control Board to any matters which may be relevant to the functions of the Board;\n【8】 - Make recommendations for the implementation of the aims and provisions of the Single Convention, including programmes of scientific research and the exchange of information of a scientific or technical nature; and\n【9】 - Draw the attention of non-parties to decisions and recommendations which it adopts under the Single Convention, with a view to their considering taking action in accordance therewith\n【10】 - Under Article 17 of the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, the Commission has power to amend the Schedules by a two-thirds vote and \"may consider all matters pertaining to the aims of this Convention and to the implementation of its provisions, and may make recommendations relating thereto.\"\n【11】 - The United Nations General Assembly has power to modify the Commission's decisions, with the exception of scheduling decisions\n【12】 # Role in drug scheduling\n【13】 - The drug control treaties divide drugs into four Schedules with varying levels of control\n【14】 - Article 3 of the Single Convention and Article 2 of the Convention on Psychotropic Substances set out the scheduling procedure, giving the Commission the power to decide which Schedule a drug or other substance shall be placed into. However, the Economic and Social Council has power to alter or reverse the Commission's scheduling decisions. In addition, each Schedule has certain findings that the World Health Organization must make with regard to a drug or substance before it be placed in that Schedule. The relationship between the WHO and the Commission is described as follows by the Commentary on the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs:\n【15】 # Membership\n【16】 - The Commission consists of 53 states, serving 4-year terms, with the following distribution of seats among regions:\n【17】 - Eleven for African States;\n【18】 - Eleven for Asian States;\n【19】 - Ten for Latin American and Caribbean States;\n【20】 - Seven for Eastern European States;\n【21】 - Fourteen for Western European and other States;\n【22】 - One seat to rotate between the Asian, and the Latin American and Caribbean States every four years\n【23】 - Council resolutions 845 (XXXII), and 1147 (XLI) provide that members are elected:\n【24】 ;\n【25】 - With due regard to the adequate representation of countries that are important producers of opium or coca leaves, of countries that are important in the field of the manufacture of narcotic drugs, and of countries in which drug addiction or the illicit traffic in narcotic drugs constitutes an important problem;\n【26】 - Taking into account the principle of equigeographical distribution\n【27】 # Debates\n【28】 - The CND's annual meeting serves as a forum for nations to debate drug policy. At the 2005 meeting, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Canada, Australia and Iran rallied in opposition to the UN's zero-tolerance approach in international drug policy. Their appeal was vetoed by the United States, while the United Kingdom delegation remained reticent. Meanwhile, U.S. Office of National Drug Control Policy Director John P. Walters clashed with United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime Executive Director Antonio Maria Costa on the issue of needle exchange programs. Walters advocated strict prohibition, while Costa opined, \"We must not deny these addicts any genuine opportunities to remain HIV-negative\"\n【29】 - The Bulletin on Narcotics has reported on the Commission's activities since 1949", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": "语义不完整#2#2#开头缺少内容\n语义不完整#8#8#结尾缺少内容\n语义不完整#23#24#缺少内容", "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-15 17:51:30", "update_time": "2024-04-15 19:13:40"}

The government has instituted a series of measures to address the situation. However, the formulation of a comprehensive drug abuse control strategy demanded a realistic assessment of the scope of the problem\n【29】 and 1993. All these surveys pointed towards a considerable increase in drug abuse.The government, held its last NSDAwith the assistance of the United Nations Drug Control Programme (UNDCP), with the name of National Drug Abuse Assessment Study 2000-2001\n【30】 - The assessment study consists of three data collection studies namely, Key Informant, Treatment Registry and Four-Cities Study. Each of the studies can be treated as independent research. At the same time, however, it allows a comparison of indicated patterns from across the entire country by virtue of the statistical assumption that what applies to known data (i.e., actual geographical locales studied in detail), would also apply to similar locales (not studied in detail)\n【31】 - The study is geared to estimate the total population of hardcore heroin users, including intravenous drug users. For other drug types, increasing and decreasing trends and patterns have been assessed. The study s scope was ascertained in keeping with budgetary allocations\n【32】 - It is important to note that this is an assessment study and not a survey as the estimates do not include drug use by household women, workplace, skilled and unskilled workers, students, transporters and recreational users\n【33】 - Findings of the Study-Highlights\n【34】 - Prevalence\n【35】 - Among males in the age bracket of 15-45 years, there are 500,000 regular heroin users and drug injectors - an alarmingly high rate by international standards\n【36】 - Major Drugs of Abuse\n【37】 - Cannabis, in one form or the other (marijuana, charas, etc), is the most commonly used drug in Pakistan in terms of lifetime use and prevalence, followed by heroin, alcohol and psychotropic substances\n【38】 - Rural/Urban\n【39】 - Charas/hashish is equally popular in urban and rural areas. Heroin abuse, however, is conspicuous as more of an urban phenomenon\n【40】 - Literacy and Employment Rates\n【41】 - Heroin abusers, on the average, have six years of education. Of the total number of heroin users, 43% are unemployed and 26% are engaged in full-time employment\n【42】 - Age Group\n【43】 - An examination of social and demographic factors reveals that 40% of the heroin abusers fall in the age bracket of 25-34 years\n【44】 - Occupation\n【45】 - Occupational grouping indicates that the frequency of drug abuse is highest among people belonging to the skilled and unskilled labour categories (47%), followed by business persons (16%), agricultural workers (5%) and students (3%)\n【46】 - Means of Financial Support\n【47】 - Among drug users, 22% sustain themselves through casual work, 18% enjoy family support, 16% are beggars, 13% are drug peddlers, and 11% resort to petty thefts and pick-pocketing\n【48】 'Gender'\n【49】 - For most drug types, abuse is not as common and pervasive among women as it is among the male population.  Psychotropic substances are the most common drugs of abuse among women.  It has also been found that women comprise only 3% of the total number of patients being reported, making it an important area for intensive research\n【50】 - Problems Associated with Drug Abuse\n【51】 - In all provinces (both urban and rural locales), heroin has been identified as the drug predominantly responsible for creating unrest in the society.  Alcohol has been rated at number two.  Whilst cannabis is the most commonly used drug in all areas, respondents do not necessarily perceive it as a cause of social upheaval.  However, in some areas, cannabis-related troubles have been reported\n【52】 - Current Drug Use\n【53】 - Among heroin users, 77% report using the drug on a daily basis.  As for hashish/charas, 41% use it on a daily basis and 34% occasionally.  Alcohol consumption remains more varied. However, most of the respondents (76%) report consuming alcohol twice or thrice a week or less, with only 10% reporting consumption for five or more days a week.  Other significant drugs include opium and tranquilizers, which are currently being used by a quarter of all respondents.  A majority of the hardcore drug abusers consists of multiple drug consumers - a fairly common phenomenon throughout the world\n【54】 - Methods of Administration\n【55】 - As many as 73% of the total heroin users either smoke the drug or inhale its fumes while 11% sniff it and 15% inject it. Injecting drug use is accompanied by high incidence of practices associated with the spread of blood-borne infections\n【56】 - Treatment and Rehabilitation\n【57】 - As for treatment and rehabilitation, 64% of the respondents report difficulties in getting treatment.  For an overwhelming majority (80%), treatment is unaffordable.  Lack of in-patient facilities in government hospitals is cited as the major deterrent for treatment by 23% of the respondents.  Forty-four percent have received treatment for a drug problem at some stage in their lives.  Ninety six percent have been treated for heroin addiction.  Most of the addicts did not receive intensive or sustained therapy\n【58】 - Prison Contact\n【59】 - Thirty-five percent of the respondents are reported to have spent some time in prison for their alleged involvement in a drug-related offence\n【60】 # Extraditionof Drug Traffickers\n【61】 - As of 29th October 2005\n【62】 - International Obligations\n【63】 - Pakistan has ratified the following United Nations (UN) Conventions and regional bilateral treaties:\n【64】 - Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs 1961 as amended by the 1972 Protocol\n【65】 - United Nations (UN) Convention on Psychotropic Substances 1971\n【66】 - United Nations(UN) Convention against Illicit Trafficking in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances 1988 and subsequent United Natrions (UN) resolutions, in particular the United Nations (UN) General Assembly s 20th Special Session Resolution S-20/4B\n【67】 - South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) Convention on Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances 1990\n【68】 - Protocol on Drug Matters with Econmic Cooperation Organization (ECO) Countries\n【69】 - Extradition\n【70】 - Extradition treaties concluded by the British government with 19 countries were adopted by Pakistan.

Apixaban and dabigatran have also been used to treat patients with HIT; however, there is very limited trial data# BACKGROUND:\n【1】 - HIT is a transient, immune-mediated adverse drug reaction in patients recently exposed to heparin that causes thrombocytopenia and often results in venous and/or arterial thrombosis. HIT occurs in up to 5% of patients receiving unfractionated heparin (UFH) for longer than 4 days and in <1% who receive low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). HIT is characterised by immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies that recognize an antigen complex of platelet factor 4 (PF4) bound to heparin. These antibodies trigger a highly prothrombotic state by causing intravascular platelet aggregation, intense platelet, monocyte and endothelial cell activation, and excessive thrombin generation\n【2】 # CLINICAL FEATURES:\n【3】 - HIT typically presents with a fall in platelet count with or without venous and/or arterial thrombosis\n【4】 - Thrombocytopenia: A platelet count fall >30% beginning 5-10 days after UFH or LMWH exposure, in the absence of other causes of thrombocytopenia, should be considered to be HIT, unless proven otherwise. A more rapid onset of platelet count fall (often within 24 hours of heparin exposure) can occur when there is a history of heparin exposure within the preceding 3 months. Bleeding is very infrequent. - Thrombosis: HIT is associated with a high risk (30-50%) of new venous or arterial thromboembolism. Thrombosis may be the presenting clinical manifestation of HIT or can occur during or shortly after the thrombocytopenia. - Other clinical manifestations of HIT: Less frequent manifestations include heparin-induced skin lesions, adrenal hemorrhagic infarction (secondary to adrenal vein thrombosis), transient global amnesia, and acute systemic reactions (e.g. chills, dyspnea, cardiac or respiratory arrest following IV heparin bolus)\n【5】 # DIAGNOSIS:\n【6】 - The diagnosis of HIT is based on three criteria:\n【7】 1 The patient is receiving or has had recent exposure to UFH or LMWH\n【8】 2 At least one clinical feature of the syndrome is present (significant fall in platelet count, new venous and/or arterial thrombosis). 3 There is laboratory evidence of HIT antibodies. 1 provide a rational approach to suspected HIT\n【9】 #  and\n【10】 # HIT ASSAYS:\n【11】 - Therapeutic decisions, including the cessation of UFH or LMWH and the administration of a HITsafe, alternative anticoagulant , should not be delayed pending the results of laboratory testing if the clinical suspicion of HIT is not low. There are two main types of tests for HIT:\n【12】 1 immunologic assays which detect antibodies to PF4/heparin complexes (\"HIT antibodies\"; e.g. enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay , particle gel immunoassay, latex particle agglutination assay), and; 2 functional assays (e.g. serotonin release assay , heparin-induced platelet aggregation )\n【13】 - In most centres, only the immunologic assay results are available on an urgent basis\n【14】 - Although both assay types are sensitive for HIT (>90%), false positives are common with the immunologic assays\n【15】 # 4TS SCORE:\n【16】 - Criteria for the 4Ts score, which is used to determine the likelihood that a patient has HIT, are outlined in  Given the high negative predictive value of the 4Ts score, laboratory testing for HIT is not always required for patients with low pre-test probability according to the 4Ts score, as long as all the elements of the score are known. Occasionally, there may be uncertainty about the score due to multiple missing platelet counts, unclear history of recent heparin exposure or concurrent potential causes of thrombocytopenia; in this case, testing for HIT should be done\n【17】 - Since the majority of patients with a positive immunologic assay do not have HIT, and because of the long-term implications of a HIT diagnosis, obtaining a confirmatory functional assay should be considered in patients with an intermediate 4Ts score and/or ELISA optical density <2.0\n【18】 # MANAGEMENT:\n【19】 - Patients with HIT are best managed by, or in consultation with, a specialist experienced in managing HIT\n【20】 - Each of the following points is important in the management of HIT:\n【21】 - Stop all heparin exposure, including LMWH, prophylactic heparin, heparin locks or flushes, and remove heparin-coated catheters. - Start anticoagulation with a non-heparin, HIT-safe anticoagulant such as fondaparinux, argatroban, a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC), bivalirudin, or danaparoid . If a new thrombotic event is present (HIT with thrombosis, or \"HITT\"), then the acute VTE treatment regimen for the DOAC is preferred, rather than the maintenance dosing regimen. For example, rivaroxaban should be initiated at 15 mg BID x 3 weeks followed by 20 mg daily. - Consider if the patient may already have had a thromboembolic event. Patients with suspected venous or arterial thrombosis should have objective confirmation since this will affect the duration of HIT-safe anticoagulant use. Even without a clinical suspicion of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), bilateral leg ultrasonography to screen for asymptomatic DVT are recommended, especially if the patient has additional risk factors for VTE. - Avoid platelet transfusions unless the patient is bleeding or requires a procedure associated with a high risk of bleeding. - Early use of warfarin should be avoided in acute HIT since it may make the prothrombotic state worse. If warfarin has already been started when HIT is diagnosed, it should be stopped, and vitamin K administered to reverse the warfarin effect. Warfarin alone is insufficient to protect against thrombosis secondary to HIT as long as HIT is considered active (i.e. platelets less than 150 x 10 9 /L). - Warfarin or a DOAC are appropriate for longer-term anticoagulation, if indicated, after thrombocytopenia has resolved. If transitioning to warfarin from a HIT-safe anticoagulant, such as fondaparinux, bivalirudin, or danaparoid: -Do not initiate warfarin until platelet count is ≥150 x 10 9 /L\n【22】 - Overlap warfarin with therapeutic doses of the HIT-safe anticoagulant for ≥5 days and until the international normalized ratio (INR) is therapeutic. Caution should be used when transitioning to warfarin from argatroban because it also increases the INR. - Duration of anticoagulation for HIT with thrombosis: at least 3 months\n【23】 - Duration of anticoagulation for HIT without thrombosis: at least 4 weeks\n【24】 - Heparin or LMWH should not be given to a patient with previous HIT without consultation with a specialist\n【25】 # SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS:\n【26】 # Pediatrics:\n【27】 - The incidence of HIT is less than in adults, but the approach to investigation and management is similar. Pediatricians with expertise in thromboembolism should manage, where possible, pediatric patients with HIT. When this is not possible, a combination of a neonatologist/pediatrician and an adult hematologist, supported by consultation with an experienced pediatric hematologist, is recommended\n【28】 # Pregnancy:\n【29】 - HIT is infrequent in pregnancy. The approach to investigation is as outlined above. Danaparoid does not cross the placenta and has been used to treat HIT in pregnancy. The use of fondaparinux (with the cautions noted above) is an option where danaparoid is not available; however, this drug has been reported to cross the placenta in small amounts and experience with fondaparinux in pregnancy is very limited (especially during the first trimester). DOACs should not be prescribed during pregnancy\n【30】 # OTHER RELEVANT THROMBOSIS CANADA CLINICAL GUIDES\n【31】 # Date of Version: 23October2021\n【32】 - Please note that the information contained herein is not to be interpreted as an alternative to medical advice from your doctor or other professional healthcare provider.

The proximal end of the catheter is attached to computerized ultrasound equipment. It allows the application of ultrasound technology to see from inside blood vessels out through the surrounding blood column, visualizing the endothelium (inner wall) of blood vessels in living individuals\n【3】 # Assessment of Atherosclerosis\n【4】 - The arteries of the heart (the coronary arteries) are the most frequent imaging target for IVUS.  IVUS is used in the coronary arteries to determine the amount of atheromatous plaque built up at any particular point in the epicardial coronary artery. The progressive accumulation of plaque within the artery wall over decades is the setup for vulnerable plaque which, in turn, leads to myocardial infarction and stenosis (narrowing) of the artery (known as coronary artery lesions). IVUS is of use to determine both plaque volume within the wall of the artery and/or the degree of stenosis of the artery lumen. It can be especially useful in situations in which angiographic imaging is considered unreliable; such as for the lumen of ostial lesions or where angiographic images do not visualize lumen segments adequately, such as regions with multiple overlapping arterial segments. It is also used to assess the effects of treatments of stenosis such as with hydraulic angioplasty expansion of the artery, with or without stents, and the results of medical therapy over time\n【5】 - Arteries can either \"positively remodel\" or \"negatively remodel\".  If there is an outward expansion of the artery to accommodate the plaque, this is referred to as positive or outward, or expansive modeling. Until the plaque occupies 40 to 50% of the volume of the artery there is no luminal  contrast, if the lumen is encroached upon this is called negative, and word or constrictive remodeling\n【6】 # Advantages over Angiography\n【7】 - Arguably the most valuable use of IVUS is to visualize plaque, which cannot be seen by angiography. It has been increasingly used in research to better understand the behavior of the atherosclerosis process in living people. Based on the angiographic view and long popular medical beliefs, it had long been assumed that areas of high grade stenosis (narrowing) of the lumen (opening) within the coronary arteries, visible by angiography, were the likely points at which most myocardial infarctions would occur. Research using IVUS has helped to reveal the fallacy (in most instances) of this belief\n【8】 - IVUS enables accurately visualizing not only the lumen of the coronary arteries but also the atheroma (membrane/cholesterol loaded white blood cells) \"hidden\" within the wall. IVUS has thus enabled advances in clinical research providing a more thorough perspective and better understanding\n【9】 - In the early 1990s, IVUS research on the re-stenosis problem after angioplasty lead to recognition that most of the re-stenosis problem (as visualized by an angiography examination) was not true re-stenosis. Instead it was simply a remodeling of the atheromatous plaque, which was still protruding into the lumen of the artery after completion of angioplasty; the stenosis only appearing to be reduced because blood and contrast could now flow around and through some of the plaque. The angiographic dye column appeared widened adequately; yet considerable plaque was within the newly widened lumen and the lumen remained partially obstructed. This recognition promoted more frequent use of stents to hold the plaque outward against the inner artery walls, out of the lumen\n【10】 - Additionally, IVUS examinations, as they were done more frequently, served to reveal and confirm the autopsy research findings of the late 1980s, showing that atheromatous plaque tends to cause expansion of the internal elastic lamina, causing the degree of plaque burden to be greatly underestimated by angiography.  Angiography only reveals the edge of the atheroma that protrudes into the lumen\n【11】 - Perhaps the greatest contribution to understanding, so far, was achieved by clinical research trials completed in the United States in the late 1990s, using combined angiography and IVUS examination, to study which coronary lesions most commonly result in a myocardial infarction.  The studies revealed that most myocardial infarctions occur at areas with extensive atheroma within the artery wall, however very little stenosis of the artery opening. The range of lumen stenosis locations at which myocardial infarctions occurred ranged from areas of mild dilatation all the way to areas of greater than 95% stenosis. However the average or typical stenosis at which myocardial infarctions occurred were found to be less than 50%, describing plaques long considered insignificant by many. Only 14% of myocardial infarction occurred at locations with 75% or more stenosis, the severe stenoses previously thought by many to present the greatest danger to the individual. This research has changed the primary focus for myocardial infarction prevention from severe narrowing to vulnerable plaque\n【12】 - Current clinical uses of IVUS technology include checking how to treat complex lesions before angioplasty and checking how well an intracoronary stent has been deployed within a coronary artery after angioplasty. If a stent is not expanded flush against the wall of the vessel, turbulent flow may occur between the stent and the wall of the vessel; some fear this might create a nidus for acute thrombosis of the artery\n【13】 # Disadvantagesof Intravascular Ultrasound\n【14】 - Expense\n【15】 In many hospitals, the IVUS recording and display equipment is on loan to the catheterization lab from the manufacturing company, with the understanding that the lab has to purchase the specialized IVUS catheters. Because no standard exists, IVUS catheters cannot be interchanged between different manufacturers\n【16】 - Increase in the time of the procedure\n【17】 - It is considered an interventional procedure, and should only be performed by angiographers that are trained in interventional cardiology techniques\n【18】 - Risk imposed by the use of the IVUS catheter including coronary thrombosis\n【19】 # Indications\n【20】 - Intravascular ultrasound is used in the following ways:\n【21】 # To Assessthe Severityof Lesions\n【22】 - Angiography often underestimates the severity of lesions. The angiogram only evaluates the lumen, and does not evaluate the plaque burden in an artery. If a lesion is present ultrasound will generally done is demonstrate that 50 to 60% of the volume of the artery is made up of plaque both proximal and distal to the lesion\n【23】 - Intravascular ultrasound has been related to defects on nuclear imaging and Doppler flow wire measurements of coronary flow reserve (CFR) and fractional flow reserve (FFR) to validate its accuracy\n【24】 - The consensus view is that any minimum lumen area (MLA)  3 mm on angiography (excluding the left main) is a significant stenosis\n【25】 # To Assessthe Underlying Morphologyof Lesions\n【26】 - Intravascular ultrasound is more sensitive in the assessment of calcium, particularly the presence of calcium deep in the wall of the artery.  In one study-this detective calcium and 73% of patients where this angiography detective calcium and only 30% of patients. The sensitivity of angiography is approximately 25% if there is one quadrant of calcium present, the sensitivity is 50% if there are two quadrants of calcium, the sensitivity is 60% if there are three quadrants of calcium and finally the sensitivity is 85% if there are for quadrants calcium.  Intravascular ultrasound demonstrates that the majority of plaque is located at the hips of bifurcation lesions and not at the Carina or flow divider. Intravascular ultrasound also indicates that the majority of lesions are more eccentric than we appreciate on angiography\n【27】 # To Assess Ostial Lesions Such As An Ostial Left Main Lesion\n【28】 - Assessment of the left main is associated with the greatest amount of inter and intraobserver variability in angiography.  The left main is short, and is often diseased with asymmetric lesions making its assessment on angiography difficult.  There may be diffuse disease which may cause an underestimation of the extent of involvement on angiography.  While luminal encroachment is defined as a minimum lumen area less than 4 mm² in the epicardial arteries, a minimum lumen area less than 6 mm² in the left main is considered to be significant.  A minimum lumen area less than 6 mm² in the left main corresponds with a fractional flow reserve less than 0.75.  A minimum lumen area less than 6 mm² also corresponds to a minimum lumen area less than 4 mm² in either the LAD or the circumflex arteries.  In interrogating ostial lesions, it is critical to disengage the guide so that it is not mistaken for the lumen of the artery\n【29】 # To Assess The Diameter And Length Of Lesions\n【30】 - Assessment of the diameter of the vessel is particularly useful in research studies such as those evaluating lipid lowering agents.  Care must be taken to identify reproducible start and end points for the mechanical pullback to ensure that the same area of the segment is being interrogated\n【31】 # To Identify Complications Such As Dissection\n【32】 - While a dissection may appear to be hazy on an angiogram, intravascular ultrasound may be helpful in more definitively defining the presence of an edge dissection either proximal or distal to freshly deployed stent\n【33】 # To Guide Stent Implantation\n【34】 - Stent apposition refers to the stent touching the vessel wall while stent expansion refers to the size of the stent\n【35】 - Poor stent apposition is of a greater concern in an artery with a small minimum stent area than in a larger artery.  Complete and position obviously may not be possible in aneurysmal segments or ectatic segments\n【36】 # To Reduce The Risk Of Stent Restenosis\n【37】 - Insofar as intravascular ultrasound optimizes the minimum stented area, several studies have shown that the use of intravascular ultrasound reduces the risk of stent restenosis. There is also data to suggest that IVUS reduces the risk of arc defined stent thrombosis. These studies were based upon propensity matched analyses rather than randomized trial data\n【38】 # Method\n【39】 - To visualize an artery or vein, angiographic techniques are used and the physician positions the tip of a guidewire, usually 0.014\" diameter with a very soft and pliable tip and about 200 cm long. The physician steers the guidewire from outside the body, through angiography catheters and into the blood vessel branch to be imaged\n【40】 - The ultrasound catheter tip is slid in over the guidewire and positioned, using angiography techniques so that the tip is at the farthest away position to be imaged. The sound waves are emitted from the catheter tip, are usually in the 10-20 MHz range, and the catheter also receives and conducts the return echo information out to the external computerized ultrasound equipment which constructs and displays a real time ultrasound image of a thin section of the blood vessel currently surrounding the catheter tip, usually displayed at 30 frames/second image\n【41】 - The guide wire is kept stationary and the ultrasound catheter tip is slid backwards, usually under motorized control at a pullback speed of 0.5 mm/s. (The motorized pullback tends to be smoother than hand movement by the physician.)\n【42】 - The (a) blood vessel wall inner lining, (b) atheromatous disease within the wall and (c) connective tissues covering the outer surface of the blood vessel are echogenic, i.e. they return echoes making them visible on the ultrasound display\n【43】 - By contrast, the blood itself and the healthy muscular tissue portion of the blood vessel wall is relatively echolucent, just black circular spaces, in the images\n【44】 - Heavy calcium deposits in the blood vessel wall both heavily reflect sound, i.e. are very echogenic, but are also distinguishable by shadowing. Heavy calcification blocks sound transmission beyond and so, in the echo images, are seen as both very bright areas but with black shadows behind (from the vantage point of the catheter tip emitting the ultrasound waves)\n【45】 ## Intravascular ultrasound in the coronary anatomy\n【46】 - While the routine use of IVUS during percutaneous coronary intervention does not improve short term outcomes, there are a number of situations in which IVUS is of particular use in the treatment of coronary artery disease of the heart.  In particular in cases when the degree of stenosis of a coronary artery is unclear, IVUS can directly quantify the percentage of stenosis and give insight into the anatomy of the plaque\n【47】 - One particular use of IVUS in the coronary anatomy is in the quantification of left main disease in cases where routine coronary angiography gives equivocal results.  Many studies in the past have shown that significant left main disease can increase mortality, and that intervention (either coronary artery bypass graft surgery or percutaneous coronary intervention) to reduce mortality is necessary when the left main stenosis is significant\n【48】 - When using IVUS to determine whether an individual's left main disease is clinically significant, in terms of the desirability of physical intervention, the two most widely used parameters are the degree of stenosis and the minimal lumen area.  A cross sectional area of ≤7 mm² in a symptomatic individual or ≤6 mm² in an asymptomatic individual is considered to be clinically significant and warrants intervention to improve one-year mortality.  However, these exact cutoffs are up for debate and different cutoff cross-sectional areas may be used in practice depending on differing interpretations of the trial data\n【49】 ## Validating the efficacy of new treatments\n【50】 - Because IVUS is widely available in coronary catheterization labs woldwide and can accurately quantify arterial plaque, especially within the coronary arteries, it is increasingly being used to evaluate newer and evolving strategies for the treatment of coronary artery disease, including the statins, torcetrapib and other approaches\n【51】 # ACCF/AHA/SCAI Guidelinesfor Percutaneous Coronary Intervention\n【52】 ## Intravascular Ultrasound", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": "序号错误#42#42#©应是（c）", "type3": null, "type4": "语义不完整#52#52# ## Intravascular Ultrasound", "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-15 17:51:30", "update_time": "2024-04-15 21:38:57"}

Although it is still used 'unofficially' in metric English-speaking countries (such as Canada, the United Kingdom, and sometimes in New Zealand), it is increasingly an outmoded and outdated unit of measure.  Elsewhere (and always in scientific use) the BTU has been replaced by the SI unit of energy, the joule (J)\n【2】 - In North America, the term \"BTU\" is used to describe the heat value (energy content) of fuels, and also to describe the power of heating and cooling systems, such as furnaces, stoves, barbecue grills, and air conditioners.

So, 1 MMBtu = 28.263682 m3 of natural gas at defined temperature and pressure\n【14】 1 standard cubic foot of natural gas yields ≈ 1030 BTU (between 1010 BTU and 1070 BTU, depending on quality when burned)\n【15】 # Associated units\n【16】 - The BTU per hour (BTU/h) is the unit of power most commonly associated with the BTU\n【17】 1 watt is approximately 3.41 BTU/h\n【18】 1000 BTU/h is approximately 293 W\n【19】 1 horsepower is approximately 2,544 BTU/h\n【20】 1 \"ton of cooling\", a common unit in North American refrigeration and air conditioning applications, is 12,000 BTU/h.

Quads are used in the United States for representing the annual energy consumption of large economies: for example, the U.S. economy used 99.75 quads/year in 2005, One quad/year is about 33.43 gigawatts\n【23】 - The BTU should not be confused with the Board of Trade Unit (B.O.T.U.), which is a much larger quantity of energy (1 kW·h, or about 3412 BTU)", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": "标点错误#5#5# by up to 0.5%:应为句号", "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-15 17:51:30", "update_time": "2024-04-15 18:31:33"}

The term may be applied to the mapping of a single gene to a single phenotype or to the belief that most or all phenotypes are determined mostly or exclusively by genes.  While it is well-established that most phenotypic variability is strongly influenced by genes, non-genetic mechanisms of inheritance are also known to exist\n【2】 # General information\n【3】 - Evidence for the genetic influence on phenotypes comes from hereditary diseases, for instance, cystic fibrosis and sickle cell anemia, which are caused by mutations in single genes, and Down syndrome and Klinefelter's syndrome by the abnormal duplication of a chromosome.  Genetic determinism of behavioral traits is related to the field of neuropsychology\n【4】 - Definitions of genetic determinism vary.  It is usually thought of as the belief that all physical and behavioural phenotypes are determined mostly or exclusively by the genes.  This belief is sometimes attributed to biologists by the media or some in the social sciences, or attributed to proponents of evolutionary psychology, though in this sense many biologists would consider it a straw man. Although there is considerable evidence that some behavioral traits in animals and humans are influenced by genetics to some extent, there is, however, no empirical support for the hypothesis that genes act unaffected by environmental factors, and virtually no modern-day geneticists would take a strong determinist stance in this regard\n【5】 - Some proponents of belief in free will charge that genetic determinism removes culpability.

A study comprising two cross-sectional surveys showed the prevalence of hypopituitarism to be 29 per 100,000 individual in the first survey and 45.5 per 100,000 individual in the second survey. Hypopituitarism can be classified on the basis of the anatomical location of pathology into primary (pituitary) and secondary (hypothalamic) hypopituitarism. It can also be classified on the basis of the portion of gland involvement into partial or complete glandular involvement. The pathophysiology of hypopituitarism mainly involves ischemic injury of the pituitary gland. The ischemia may be due to hemorrhage, tumors, brain injury, and compression or occlusion of the hypophyseal blood vessels. Causes of hypopituitarism may be classified based upon the etiology such as congenital or acquired. Common congenital causes include idiopathic, anatomic lesion in the sella turcica and CNS malformations. Common acquired causes may include pituitary macroadenoma, craniopharyngioma, surgery, radiation, traumatic brain injury, Sheehan's syndrome, apoplexy, SAH, meningitis, hypophysitis, meningioma, lymphoma, hemochromatosis and Wegner's granulomatosis. Less common causes include peri-natal insults, genetic causes, and pituitary hypoplasia or aplasia. Hypopituitarism should be differentiated from other diseases causing panhypopituitarism, hypothyroidism, hypogonadism, ACTH deficiency, GH deficiency, ADH deficiency and high prolactin level. Common risk factors in the development of hypopituitarism may include pituitary tumor or space occupying lesion, pituitary apoplexy, severe blood loss such as Sheehan's syndrome, pituitary surgery, cranial radiation, genetic defects, hypothalamic disease, immunosuppression, inflammatory processes, pituitary infarction and non-compliance with hormone replacement therapy. Less common risk factors include infiltrative disorders, traumatic brain injury causing skull fractures, ischemic stroke and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Screening of hypopituitarism has been recommended for the patients with traumatic brain injury and patients with a history of radiation exposure on the head. The natural history of hypopituitarism depends on the severity of damage leading to partial or complete hormonal deficiency. If left untreated can lead to critical consequences.  Complications of hypopituitarism include adrenal crisis, osteoporosis, electrolyte abnormalities, and diabetes mellitus. Hypopituitarism is often associated with vascular conditions and has a high mortality rate. Hypopituitarism has a good prognosis as long as the hormonal replacement therapy is given adequately. A positive history of head trauma, adenoma, a lesion such as a sellar lesion, or any symptom related to pituitary hormonal deficiency is suggestive of hypopituitarism. Patients of hypopituitarism may be asymptomatic or show symptoms which can be nonspecific or specific for the deficient hormone. Patients with acute onset of hypopituitarism can present with a headache, nausea, vomiting, visual impairment, fatigue, cold intolerance, hypotension, and dizziness. Patients with chronic hypopituitarism can present with pallor, weight loss, and anorexia. Clinical presentation in hypopituitarism depends upon the onset, the severity of hormonal deficiency and the number of deficient hormones. A subnormal or reduced concentration of pituitary hormones is diagnostic of hypopituitarism. Patients with complete hormonal deficiencies are mostly symptomatic and have low serum concentrations of both, the pituitary hormones as well as the target-organ hormones. Patients having partial hormonal deficiencies are detected by dynamic tests/stimulatory tests such as corticotropin stimulation, insulin-induced hypoglycemia, and metyrapone test. MRI scan with intravenous gadolinium is the imaging procedure of choice in the diagnosis of hypopituitarism. It is preferred over the CT scan as optic chiasm, pituitary stalk, and cavernous sinuses can be seen in MRI. Treatment involves appropriate hormone replacement therapy, which must be taken for the rest of your life that results in significant improvement and reversal of not only the physical symptoms but also the psychological symptoms. Conditions that need a surgical consideration may include pituitary apoplexy , microadenomas with GH or ACTH hypersecretion and debulking macroadenomas with mass symptoms and resistant to medical therapy. Hypopituitarism can be prevented by good obstetric care, minimizing radiation exposure and high-resolution microscopic hypophyseal surgery done by experienced neurosurgeons\n【3】 # Historical Perspective\n【4】 - Hypopituitarism was first described by Dr. Simmonds for the first time in 1914. Dr. Yalow and Berson discovered the radioimmunoassay in 1950. Causes of the hypopituitarism were being described through the 20th and 21st centuries\n【5】 # Classification\n【6】 - Hypopituitarism can be classified on the basis of location of pathology into primary or secondary hypopituitarism. It can also be classified on the basis of the extent of gland involved into partial or complete glandular involvement\n【7】 # Pathophysiology\n【8】 - Hypopituitarism occurs secondary to ischemia of the pituitary gland. This ischemia can be due to hemorrhage, tumors, or brain injury. Compression of the blood vessels is one of the mechanisms that cause ischemia to the pituitary gland and leads to hypopituitarism. Pituitary adenomas cause compression of the hypophyseal vessels leading to interruption in the blood supply of the pituitary gland. Traumatic brain injury either primary or secondary also leads to pituitary gland dysfunction\n【9】 # Causes\n【10】 - Causes of hypopituitarism can be classified based upon the etiology into congenital or acquired. Common congenital causes include idiopathic, anatomiclesion in the sella turcica and CNS malformations. Common acquired causes may include pituitary macroadenoma, craniopharyngioma, surgery, radiation,traumatic brain injury, Sheehan's syndrome, apoplexy, SAH, meningitis, hypophysitis, meningioma, lymphoma, hemochromatosis and Wegner's granulomatosis. Less common causes include Peri-natal insults, genetic causes, such as Kallman syndrome, Pallister-Hall syndrome, Rieger syndrome, and pituitary hypoplasia or aplasia\n【11】 # Differentiating Hypopituitarismfrom Other Diseases\n【12】 - Hypopituitarism should be differentiated from other diseases causing panhypopituitarism, hypothyroidism, hypogonadism, ACTH deficiency, GH deficiency,ADH deficiency and high prolactin level\n【13】 # Epidemiology and Demographics\n【14】 - In a longitudinal survey , the incidence of hypopituitarism was estimated to be 4.2 cases per 100,000. A study comprising two cross-sectional surveys showed the prevalence of hypopituitarism to be 29 - 45.5 per 100.000 individual\n【15】 # Risk Factors\n【16】 - Common risk factors in the development of hypopituitarism may include pituitary tumor or space occupying lesion, pituitary apoplexy, severe blood loss such as Sheehan's syndrome, pituitary surgery, cranial radiation, genetic defects, hypothalamic disease, immunosuppression, inflammatory processes,pituitary infarction and non-compliance with hormone replacement therapy. Less common risk factors include infiltrative disorders, traumatic brain injurycausing skull fractures, ischemic stroke and subarachnoid hemorrhage\n【17】 # Screening\n【18】 - Screening of hypopituitarism has been recommended for the patients with traumatic brain injury and patients with a history of radiation exposure on the head\n【19】 # Natural History, Complications, and Prognosis\n【20】 - The natural history of hypopituitarism depends on the severity of damage leading to partial or complete hormonal deficiency. If left untreated, hypopituitarism can lead to critical consequences. Complications of hypopituitarism include adrenal crisis, osteoporosis, electrolyte abnormalities anddiabetes mellitus. Hypopituitarism is often associated with vascular conditions. Hypopituitarism has a good prognosis as long as the hormonal replacement therapy is given adequately\n【21】 # Diagnosis\n【22】 ## History and Symptoms\n【23】 - A positive history of head trauma, adenoma, a lesion such as a sellar lesion, or any symptom related to pituitary hormonal deficiency is suggestive ofhypopituitarism. Patients of hypopituitarism may be asymptomatic or show symptoms which can be nonspecific or specific for the deficient hormone. Patients with acute onset of hypopituitarism can present with a headache, nausea, vomiting, visual impairment, fatigue, cold intolerance, hypotension, anddizziness. Patients with chronic hypopituitarism can present with pallor, weight loss, and anorexia\n【24】 ## Physical Examination\n【25】 - Clinical presentation in hypopituitarism depends upon the onset, the severity of hormonal deficiency and the number of deficient hormones. Patients with hypopituitarism are ill-appearing and usually look tired. Physical examination of patients with hypopituitarism is usually remarkable for the respectivehormonal deficiency and present with features of that specific hormone such as hypothyroidism presents as delayed relaxation of tendon reflexes,bradycardia, coarse skin, puffy facies, and loss of eyebrows. ACTH deficiency can present with postural hypotension, tachycardia, and weight loss.Gonadotropin deficiency may present with breast atrophy, soft testes, and regression of sexual characteristics. Growth hormone deficiency can present with short stature, decreased sweating with impaired thermogenesis, and reduced muscle mass\n【26】 ## Laboratory Findings\n【27】 - A subnormal or reduced concentration of pituitary hormones is diagnostic of hypopituitarism. Patients with complete hormonal deficiencies are mostlysymptomatic and have low serum concentrations of both, the pituitary hormones as well as the target-organ hormones. Patients having partial hormonaldeficiencies are detected by dynamic tests/stimulatory tests such as corticotropin stimulation, insulin-induced hypoglycemia and metyrapone test.Corticotropin deficiency is detected by assessing basal cortisol secretion. Patients with intermediate cortisol levels need to be tested foradrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) reserve. There are several tests to check the ACTH reserve. Metyrapone test is preferred over others as it is applicable to all adults with no age restriction and has good correlation with stress related cortisol response. Patients with hypopituitarism are screened forhypothyroidism by measuring thyroxine, total thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) uptake, and free T4. Gonadotropin deficiency is confirmed with lowestradiol, low testosterone, and low/normal serum FSH/LH. Growth hormone deficiency is confirmed with provocative tests (insulin induced hypoglycemiaand arginine and GHRH combination) for GH secretion resulting in subnormal levels of serum GH levels, serum insulin-like growth factor-1 levels lower than the age-specific lower limit of normal and deficiency of more than one pituitary hormones e.g ACTH, TSH, and gonadotropins. ADH deficiency is assessed by water deprivation test and ADH suppression test. Prolactin deficiency can be confirmed by directly measuring prolactin levels on more than 1 occasion as its secretion is episodic but it is not done routinely as it is not clinically significant\n【28】 ## Electrocardiogram\n【29】 - There are no electrocardiogram findings associated with hypopituitarism\n【30】 ## X ray\n【31】 - There are no X ray findings associated with hypopituitarism\n【32】 ## CT scan\n【33】 - CT scan is preferred over MRI for visualization of calcification in a meningioma or a craniopharyngioma. Routine CT is insensitive to the diagnosis unless frank intracranial hemorrhage is present.The pituitary mass may be evident and be hyperdense\n【34】 # MRI\n【35】 - MRI is the imaging procedure of choice in the diagnosis of hypopituitarism. It is preferred over the CT scan as optic chiasm, pituitary stalk, and cavernous sinuses can be seen in MRI. An MRI lesion needs to be related to clinical and lab findings. The absence of an MRI lesion mostly indicates a non-organic etiology. Cystic lesions, such as Rathke's cleft cysts may have a low-intensity signal on T1-weighted images and a high-intensity signal on T2-weighted images. Meningiomas have a homogenous postcontrast enhancement than pituitary adenomas and have a suprasellar attachment. Hemorrhage into the pituitary gland results in a high-intensity signal on both T1- and T2-weighted images\n【36】 ## Ultrasound\n【37】 - There are no ultrasound findings associated with hypopituitarism\n【38】 ## Other imaging findings\n【39】 - There are no other specific imaging findings for hypopituitarism\n【40】 ## Other diagnostic studies\n【41】 - Other diagnostic findings may include serum and CSF angiotensin converting enzyme activities, serum ferritin to rule out hemochromatosis, human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) and genetic testing\n【42】 # Treatment\n【43】 ## Medical Therapy\n【44】 - The mainstay of treatment for hypopituitarism is hormone replacement therapy and treating the underlying cause. Adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) deficiency is treated with glucocorticoids. Gonadotropin deficiency is treated with testosterone in men and estrogen with or without progesterone in women.Hypothyroidism is treated with levothyroxine. Growth hormone (GH) is usually replaced in children and replaced in adults only if symptomatic and after replacement of all other pituitary hormones\n【45】 ## Surgery\n【46】 - The feasibility of surgery depends on the clinical condition and underlying etiology. Conditions that need a surgical consideration may include pituitary apoplexy, microadenomas with growth hormone (GH) or adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) hypersecretion and debulking macroadenomas with masssymptoms and resistant to medical therapy\n【47】 ## Primary Prevention\n【48】 - Hypopituitarism can be prevented by good obstetric care, minimizing radiation exposure and high-resolution microscopic hypophyseal surgery done by experienced neurosurgeons\n【49】 ## Secondary Prevention\n【50】 - Secondary prevention may be done by long-term monitoring of patients for complications of hormonal replacement therapy and by dose adjustments in stressful situations", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type4": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-15 17:51:30", "update_time": "2024-04-15 18:18:15"}

The recommendations include a basic change in the routine childhood vaccination schedule from a one-dose to a two-dose schedule using combined measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine. Routine revaccination w ill gener ally be implemented one age group at a time starting with school enterers. New recommendations are also included for vaccination o f preschool children at high risk of contracting measles, for students in colleges and other institutions o f higher education, for health-care personnel and international travelers, and for outbreak control.# INTRODUCTION\n【1】 - Measles (rubeola) is often a severe disease, frequently complicated by middle ear infection or bronchopneumonia. Encephalitis occurs in approximately one of every 1,000 reported cases; survivors of this complication often have permanent brain damage and mental retardation. Death, usually from respiratory and neurologic causes, occurs in one of every 1,000 reported measles cases. The risk of death is greater for infants and adults than for children and adolescents\n【2】 - Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a \"slow virus\" infection of the central nervous system associated with measles virus. Widespread use of measles vaccine has led to the virtual disappearance of SSPE from the United States\n【3】 - Measles illness during pregnancy leads to increased rates of premature labor, spontaneous abortion, and low-birth-weight infants . Whether measles infection in the first trimester of pregnancy is associated with an increased rate of congenital malformations is still unresolved\n【4】 - Before measles vaccine was available, more than 400,000 measles cases were reported each year in the United States . However, since virtually all children acquired measles, the true number of cases probably exceeded 4 million per year (i.e., the entire birth cohort). Since 1963, when both an inactivated and a live attenuated vaccine (Edmonston B strain) were licensed for use in the United States, both the type of measles vaccine and the recommended age for measles vaccination have changed several times. After 1967 and 1975, the inactivated and the Edmonston B vaccine, respectively, were no longer distributed. A live, further attenuated vaccine (Schwarz strain) was first introduced in 1965, and a similar vaccine (Moraten strain) was licensed in 1968. These further attenuated vaccines cause fewer reactions than the Edmonston B vaccine, yet are equally effective. The Moraten vaccine is the vaccine used currently in the United States\n【5】 - A single dose of live measles vaccine had been recommended since measles vaccine was first licensed . In 1963, the recommended age for vaccination was 9 months, but in 1965 it was changed to 12 months, and in 1976 it was changed to 15 months because of evidence demonstrating greater efficacy when children were vaccinated at these ages. Persons vaccinated before the first birthday needed to be revaccinated\n【6】 # MEASLES EPIDEMIOLOGY AND ELIMINATION EFFORTS\n【7】 - Since vaccine licensure in 1963, the collaborative efforts of professional and voluntary medical and public health organizations in vaccination programs have resulted in a 99% reduction in the reported incidence of measles. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, the number of reported cases decreased to between 22,000 and 75,000 cases per year. Although incidence fell dramatically in all age groups, children <10 years of age showed the greatest decline, while older children had a slightly less dramatic decrease. As a result, the proportion of total cases occurring in different age groups changed. From 1984 to 1988, 58% of reported cases affected children ^10 years of age, compared with 10% during the period 1960 to 1964\n【8】 The three components of this program have been 1 maintenance of high levels of immunity, 2 careful surveillance of disease, and 3 aggressive outbreak control. As a result of these efforts, the number of cases reported annually dropped from 26,871 in 1978 to an all-time low of 1,497 in 1983. The number of cases reported then increased until 1986 . Reported cases decreased in 1987 and 1988 but rose again during the first 48 weeks of 1989, when more than 14,000 cases were reported\n【9】 - Measles cases are routinely reported by state and local health departments to the MMWR. The Division of Immunization, Center for Prevention Services, CDC, collects supplementary data on cases, including information on vaccination status (i.e., vaccinated or unvaccinated). Persons appropriately vaccinated for measles are those who have received a dose of live measles vaccine on or after their first birthday\n【10】 - Unvaccinated persons with measles can be subclassified into three general groups: those for whom vaccine is not routinely indicated (e.g., those <16 months of age, born before 1957, with prior physician diagnosis of measles, or with medical contraindications), those for whom vaccination is difficult to achieve (e.g., non-U.S. citizens and persons exempted for religious or philosophic reasons), and those for whom vaccine is indicated (e.g., children ^1 6 months of age and children vaccinated before their first birthdays). From 1985 through 1988, information on vaccination status for 16,819 measles cases was collected by the Division of Immunization. Appropriately vaccinated persons accounted for 42%, and 92% of cases in this group occurred among persons ^5 years of age. In 26% of these cases, the patients were unvaccinated persons for whom vaccine was not routinely indicated or for whom vaccination was difficult to achieve. The remaining 32% were unvaccinated persons for whom vaccine was indicated. Forty-two percent of the persons in this latter group were children 16 months to 4 years of age\n【11】 - In recent years, two major types of outbreaks have occurred in the United States: those among unvaccinated preschool-aged children, including those younger than the recommended age for vaccination ,i.e., 98%. These outbreaks have occurred in all parts of the country, including areas that had not reported measles for years\n【12】 - In general, attack rates in individual schools were low (1%-5%) and the calculated vaccine efficacy high. Most of the persons with measles in college outbreaks were also likely to have been vaccinated, although documentation of vaccination was often lacking. However, in many outbreaks, children vaccinated at 12-14 months of age had higher attack rates than those vaccinated at older ages . In a few outbreaks, older persons vaccinated in the more distant past were at increased risk for disease; this risk was independent of age at vaccination\n【13】 - The goal of eliminating measles in the United States has not been reached primarily because of 1 failure to implement the current vaccination strategy, resulting in large numbers of unvaccinated preschool-age children in some areas, and 2 vaccine failure. A substantial number of cases occur among persons who previ ously have been vaccinated. Theoretically, vaccine failures may either be primary (i.e., an adequate response to vaccination never developed) or secondary (i.e., an adequate response initially developed, but immunity was lost overtime). Some of the reported vaccine failures may be explained by the fact that a person's records incorrectly indicated appropriate vaccination. Measles vaccine is at least 95% effec tive for children vaccinated at >15 months of age. However, efficacy may be slightly lower for persons vaccinated between 12 and 14 months of age, presumably because transplacental maternal antibody persists beyond the first birthday in some children and interferes with the response to vaccination. Also, secondary vaccine failure could occur after successful vaccination as a result of waning immunity, but the percentage of persons to whom this applies appears to be small . Overall, the great majority of vaccinees appear to have long-term and probably life-long immunity. Nevertheless, further studies are needed to determine the duration of vaccineinduced immunity\n【14】 # CHANGES IN MEASLES VACCINATION POLICY\n【15】 - The Committee reviewed current measles epidemiology and the measles elimina tion strategy and considered modifications. New recommendations were developed to help achieve the goal of measles elimination s 1 and 2. A routine two-dose measles vaccination schedule now is recommended. This schedule is expected to provide protection to most persons who do not respond to their initial vaccination\n【16】 - The first dose is recommended at 15 months of age for children in most areas of the country but at 12 months of age for children in some areas with recurrent measles transmission. The second dose is recommended at the time a child enters school at kindergarten or first grade . Because programs to administer a second dose of measles vaccine at school entry to kindergarten or first grade will not have an immediate effect on the incidence of measles for school-aged children, programs also are recommended for outbreak control  and for the routine vaccination of students entering college\n【17】 - When fully implemented, this schedule should lead to the elimination of measles among school-aged children and college students. It is expected to prevent the 35%-40% of cases affecting persons ^5 years of age who appear to be vaccine failures, and it may indirectly protect unvaccinated persons since the risk of exposure to measles will decrease. Outbreaks of measles in school settings are likely to cease, thus avoiding the substantial disruption of routine activities and the high cost of outbreak control. However, the overall goal of eliminating measles in the United States also requires more intensive efforts to vaccinate preschool children at the recommended ages, particularly children residing in inner cities\n【18】 - All contacts with health-care providers in physicians' offices, clinics, emergency rooms, and hospitals are opportunities for evaluating the vaccination status of children, both patients and accompanying siblings, and for offering vaccine to those who need it. Unvaccinated children should not be rescheduled for vaccination; rather, they should be vaccinated immediately if no contraindication exists. Particular attention should be paid to offering simultaneous vaccination. No preschool child\n【19】 # MEASLES VIRUS VACCINE\n【20】 - Live measles virus vaccine- used in the United States is prepared in chickembryo-cell culture. It is available in monovalent (measles only) form and in two combinations: measles-rubella (MR) and measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccines\n【21】 - Measles vaccine produces an inapparent or mild, noncommunicable infection. Measles antibodies develop in at least 95% of susceptible children vaccinated at ^15 months of age. Although the titers of vaccine-induced antibodies are lower than those \"Official name: Measles Virus Vaccine, Live Attenuated. ^Available in the United States as Attenuvax (single antigen), M-R-Vax (measles-rubella) and M-M-R II (measles-mumps-rubella), from the Merck, Sharp and Dohme Co\n【22】 #  Recommendations for measles outbreak control\n【23】 # Outbreaks in preschool-aged children\n【24】 - Lower age for vaccination to as low as 6 months of age in outbreak area if cases are occurring in children <1 year of aget\n【25】 - Outbreaks in institutions: day-care centers, K-12th grades, colleges, and other institutions Revaccination of all students and their siblings and of school personnel born in or after 1957 who do not have documentation of immunity to measles5\n【26】 # Outbreaks in medical facilities\n【27】 - Revaccination of all medical workers born in or after 1957 who have direct patient contact and who do not have proof of immunity to measles5. Vaccination may also be considered for workers born before 1957\n【28】 - Susceptible personnel who have been exposed should be relieved from direct patient contact from the 5th to the 21st day after exposure (regardless of whether they received measles vaccine or IG) o r -i f they become ill-f o r 7 days after they _____________________________________________ develop rash._______________________ \"Mass revaccination of entire populations is not necessary. Revaccination should be limited to populations at risk, such as students attending institutions where cases occur. \"^Children initially vaccinated before the first birthday should be revaccinated at 15 months of age. A second dose should be administered at the time of school entry or according to local policy. documentation of physician-diagnosed measles disease, serologic evidence of immunity to measles, or documentation of receipt of two doses of measles vaccine on or after the first birthday\n【29】 - following natural disease, both serologic and epidemiologic evidence indicate that vaccine-induced protection appears to be long-lasting in most individuals\n【30】 # Vaccine Shipmentand Storage\n【31】 - The administration of improperly stored vaccine may fail to provide protection against measles. Although the current measles vaccine may be more thermosthan vaccine produced in the past, it should be stored at 2-8 C (35.6-46.4 F) or colder during storage. Vaccine must be shipped at 10 C (50 F) or colder and may be shipped on dry ice. It must be protected from light, which may inactivate the virus. Reconsti tuted vaccine must be stored in a refrigerator (not frozen) and discarded if not used within 8 hours\n【32】 # VACCINE USAGE General Recommendations\n【33】 - All vaccines containing measles virus are recommended for routine use for children 15 months of age. Persons born in or after 1957 who lack documentation of measles immunity  are considered susceptible and should be vaccinated if there are no contraindications . All vaccinations should be documented in the patient's permanent medical record . A parental history of vaccination, by itself, is not considered adequate documentation. A physician should not provide an immunization record for a patient unless s/he has administered the vaccine or has seen a record that documents vaccination. Most persons born before 1957 are likely to have been naturally infected with measles virus and generally need not be considered susceptible; however, vaccination may be offered to these persons if there is reason to believe they may be susceptible\n【34】 - Both doses of measles vaccine should be given as combined MMR vaccine when given on or after the first birthday. The combined vaccine is preferred to assure immunity to all three viruses. Mumps revaccination is particularly important. Recent studies have shown that mumps can occur in highly vaccinated populations, resulting in substantial numbers of cases among persons with histories of prior mumps vaccination. Although rubella vaccine failure has not been a major problem, the potential consequences of rubella vaccine failure are substantial (i.e., congenital rubella syndrome), and the use of MMR should provide an additional safeguard against such failures\n【35】 - The most commonly used laboratory test for assessing immunity to measles has been the hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) test. Other more sensitive assays, such as the enzyme immuno-assay (EIA), are now being used by many laboratories. Persons with measles-specific antibody, detecby any test, are considered immune. Routine serologic screening to determine measles immunity is not generally recom mended, although it may be cost-effective in some situations (e.g., large prepaid medical programs). However, the test may not be widely available, and screening requires that tracking systems be established to assure that identified susceptibles return for vaccination. In addition, screening for antibodies for mumps and rubella would further decrease the cost-effectiveness of this strategy\n【36】 # Dosage\n【37】 - Two doses of measles vaccine, generally given as MMR, are recommended for all children after the first birthday. The dose is 0.5 ml and should be given subcutane ously\n【38】 # Age at Vaccination\n【39】 # Routinechildhoodimmunizationscheduleformostareasofthe United States\n【40】 - The first dose of measles vaccine should be given when children are =M5 months of age. The second dose should routinely be given when children enter kindergarten or first grade (4-6 years of age)\n【41】 - The recommended time for the second dose is based primarily on administrative considerations. The current childhood immunization schedule recommends other vaccines (diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis vaccine  and oral poliovirus vaccine ) when children enter school; therefore, an additional provider visit for the second dose of measles vaccine is not necessary. In addition, most school authorities have systems at this grade level for identifying and tracking children with incomplete immunizations\n【42】 - Because many of the vaccine failures in recent outbreaks of measles have occurred among 10 to 19-year-old children and adolescents, administering the second dose at the time of school entry may not achieve full impact on the incidence of measles for 5 to 15 years. For the impact to occur more rapidly, some localities may choose to give students the second dose at an older age (e.g., when they enter middle school or junior high school). In deciding when to administer the second dose, health officials should consider how they can best achieve a high vaccination rate since this is essential to assure maximum impact of a two-dose schedule. Some localities may want to provide a second dose to multiple age groups from kindergarten through 12th grade to achieve complete immunization of all school-aged children more rapidly\n【43】 - Children who have received two doses of live measles vaccine on or after the first birthday (at least 1 month apart) do not need an additional dose when they enter school. Children who have no documentation of live measles vaccination when they enter school should be admitted after the first dose. A second dose should be given according to local policy, but no less than 1 month later\n【44】 # Routine childhood immunization schedule for areas with recurrent measles transmission\n【45】 - Initial vaccination with MMR at 12 months of age is recommended for children living in high-risk areas. This strategy assumes that the benefit of preventing measles cases between 12 and 15 months of age outweighs the slightly lower efficacy of the vaccine when given at this age. A high-risk area is defined as: 1 a county with more than five cases among preschool-aged children during each of the last 5 years, 2 a county with a recent outbreak among unvaccinated preschool-aged children, or 3 a county with a large inner-city urban population. These recommendations may be implemented for an entire county or only in defined high-risk areas\n【46】 # Revaccinationof Persons Vaccinated Accordingto Earlier Recommendations Previousvaccinationwithlivevaccine\n【47】 - Persons vaccinated with live measles vaccine before their first birthday should be considered unvaccinated. If they are entering kindergarten or first grade, college or other post-high school educational institutions , or begin ning employment in a medical facility  and cannot provide documentation of immunity to measles , they should receive two doses of vaccine no less than 1 month apart\n【48】 - Live attenuated Edmonston B vaccine (distributed from 1963-1975) was usually administered with immune globulin (IG) or high-titer measles immune globulin (MIG; no longer available in the United States). This vaccine, administered on or after the first birthday, is accepas an effective first dose of vaccine. A second dose should be administered as recommended above. However, if a further attenuated measles vaccine (i.e., Schwarz or Moraten) was given simultaneously with IG or MIG, the IG or MIG may have impaired the immune response to vaccination. Persons who received measles vaccine of unknown type or further attenuated measles vaccine accompa nied by IG or MIG should be considered unvaccinated and should be given two doses of vaccine as outlined above\n【49】 # Previous vaccination with inactivated vaccine or vaccine of unknown type\n【50】 - Inactivated (killed) measles vaccine was available in the United States only from 1963 to 1967 but was available through the early 1970s in some other countries. It was frequently given as a series of two or three injections. Some persons who received inactivated vaccine are at risk of developing severe atypical measles syndrome when exposed to the natural virus . Consequently, such persons should receive two doses of live vaccine separated by no less than 1 month. Persons vaccinated with inactivated vaccine followed within 3 months by live vaccine should be revaccinated with two doses of live vaccine. Revaccination is particularly important when the risk of exposure to natural measles virus is increased, as may occur during international travel\n【51】 - A wide range (4%-55%) of recipients of inactivated measles vaccine who were later revaccinated with live measles vaccine have had reactions to the live vaccine . Most of these reactions have been mild, consisting of local swelling and erythema, with or without low-grade fever lasting 1-2 days. Rarely, more severe reactions, including prolonged high fevers and extensive local reactions, have been reported. However, recipients of inactivated measles vaccine are more likely to have serious illness when exposed to natural measles than when given live measles virus vaccine\n【52】 - These same recommendations for revaccination apply to persons vaccinated between 1963 and 1967 with vaccine of unknown type, since they may have received inactivated vaccine. Since inactivated measles vaccine was not distributed in the United States after 1967, persons vaccinated after 1967 with a vaccine of unknown type need not be revaccinated routinely unless the original vaccination occurred before the first birthday or was accompanied by IG or MIG. However, such persons should receive a second dose if they are entering college, beginning employment in medical facilities, or planning international travel\n【53】 # Measles Immunity\n【54】 - Persons are considered immune to measles if they 1 were born before 1957, 2 have documentation of physician-diagnosed measles, 3 have laboratory evidence of immunity to measles, or 4 have documentation of adequate vaccination. Eventually, adequate vaccination will be defined as receipt of one dose of live measles vaccine on or after the first birthday for children before they enter school and two doses of measles vaccine on or after the first birthday for children who are entering or have entered school\n【55】 - For localities implementing the second dose for students at ages beyond school entry (e.g., entry to middle school or junior high school), accepevidence of immunity will be one dose at school entry and two doses for students older than the routine age of the second dose\n【56】 - Since most areas will implement the two-dose schedule one age group at a time, criteria for adequate vaccination will vary in the interim. For example, if the two-dose schedule is implemented in 1990, children in kindergarten or first grade will need to have documentation of two doses of measles vaccine after the first birthday to be considered adequately vaccinated. However, a single dose of vaccine will be accept able evidence of adequate vaccination for children in higher grades. Two years later, children in kindergarten through second or third grade will need two doses of measles vaccine for accepevidence of adequate vaccination. Similar criteria would apply if the second-dose strategy is implemented at an older age\n【57】 - The interim vaccination criteria for adequate measles vaccination noted above apply to routine settings only. During outbreaks, all persons at risk and born in or after 1957 who are in kindergarten, first grade, or beyond will need two doses on or after the first birthday as evidence of adequate vaccination\n【58】 # Individuals Exposedto Disease\n【59】 # Use of vaccine\n【60】 - Exposure to measles is not a contraindication to vaccination. If live measles vaccine is given within 72 hours of measles exposure, it may provide some protection. This approach is preferable to using IG for persons 2*12 months of age. If the exposure does not result in infection, vaccination should induce protection against subsequent measles infection\n【61】 # Useof IG\n【62】 - IG can prevent or modify measles in a susceptible person if given within 6 days of exposure. The recommended dose of IG is 0.25 ml/kg (0.11 ml/lb) of body weight (maximum dose = 15 ml). IG may be especially indicated for susceptible household contacts of measles patients, particularly contacts <1 year of age, pregnant women, or immunocompromised persons, for whom the risk of complications is increased. The recommended dose of IG for immunocompromised persons is 0.5 ml/kg of body weight (maximum dose = 15 ml). Live measles vaccine should be given 3 months later (when passively acquired measles antibodies should have disappeared) if the individual is then at least 15 months old. IG should not be used to control measles outbreaks\n【63】 # MMWR December29f1989\n【64】 # Special Situations\n【65】 # Recommendations for colleges and other institutions\n【66】 - Colleges, technical schools, and other institutions for post-high school education should require documentation of two doses of live measles-containing vaccines, documentation of prior physician-diagnosed measles disease, or laboratory evidence of measles immunity before entry for all students born in or after 1957. Students who have no documentation of live measles vaccination or other evidence of measles immunity at the time of school entry should be admitted after receiving the first dose. A second dose should be given no less than 1 month later. Institutions may wish to extend this requirement to all classes\n【67】 # Recommendations for medical facilities\n【68】 - Medical personnel are at higher risk for acquiring measles than the general population . Hospitals should require evidence of two live measles vaccinations, documentation of physician-diagnosed measles disease, or laboratory evidence of measles immunity for medical staff beginning employment who will have direct patient contact. Persons born in or after 1957 who have no documentation of vaccination or other evidence of measles immunity should be vaccinated at the time of employment and revaccinated no less than 1 month later. If resources are available, institutions may wish to extend this recommendation to all medical personnel, not just those beginning employment. Since some medical personnel who have acquired measles in medical facilities were born before 1957, institutions may consider requiring at least one dose of measles vaccine for older employees who are at risk of occupational exposure to measles\n【69】 # Recommendations for international travel\n【70】 - Persons traveling abroad should be immune to measles. The protection of young adults who have escaped measles disease and have not been vaccinated is especially important. Consideration should be given to providing a dose of measles vaccine to persons born in or after 1957 who travel abroad, who have not previously received two doses of measles vaccine, and who do not have other evidence of measles immunity\n【71】 - The age for measles vaccination should be lowered for children traveling to areas in which measles is endemic or epidemic. Children 12-14 months of age should receive MMR vaccine before their departure. Children 6-11 months of age should receive a dose of monovalent measles vaccine before departure, although there is no specific contraindication to the use of MMR for this age group if monovalent measles vaccine is not available. Seroconversion rates observed for measles, mumps, and rubella antigens are significantly less among children vaccinated before the first birthday than among older children. Children who receive monovalent measles vaccine or MMR before their first birthday should be considered unvaccinated and should receive two doses of MMR at later ages. Whereas the optimal age for the first revaccination dose is 15 months, the age for revaccination may be as low as 12 months if the child remains in a high-risk area . The second revaccination dose would normally be given when a child enters school or according to local policy\n【72】 - Since virtually all infants <6 months of age will be protected by maternally derived antibodies, no additional protection against measles is necessary in this age group\n【73】 # SIDE EFFECTS AND ADVERSE REACTIONS\n【74】 - More than 170 million doses of measles vaccine were distributed in the United States from 1963 through 1988. The vaccine has an excellent record of safety. From 5%-15% of vaccinees may develop a temperature of ^103 F (^39.4 C) beginning 5-12 days after vaccination and usually lasting several days . Most persons with fever are otherwise asymptomatic. Transient rashes have been reported for approximately 5% of vaccinees. Central nervous system conditions, including encephalitis and encephalopathy, have been reported with a frequency of less than one per million doses administered. The incidence of encephalitis or encephalopathy after measles vaccination of healthy children is lower than the observed incidence of encephalitis of unknown etiology. This finding suggests that the reported severe neurologic disor ders temporally associated with measles vaccination were not caused by the vaccine. These adverse events should be anticipated only in susceptible vaccinees and do not appear to be age-related. After revaccination, reactions should be expected to occur only among the small proportion of persons who failed to respond to the first dose\n【75】 # Personaland Family Historyof Convulsions\n【76】 - As with the administration of any agent that can produce fever, some children may have a febrile seizure. Although children with a personal or family history of seizures are at increased risk for developing idiopathic epilepsy, febrile seizures following vaccinations do not in themselves increase the probability of subsequent epilepsy or other neurologic disorders. Most convulsions following measles vaccination are simple febrile seizures, and they affect children without known risk factors\n【77】 - An increased risk of these convulsions may occur among children with a prior history of convulsions or those with a history of convulsions in first-degree family members (i.e., siblings or parents) . Although the precise risk cannot be determined, it appears to be low\n【78】 - In developing vaccination recommendations for these children, the Committee considered a number of factors, including risks from measles disease, the large proportion (5%-7%) of children with a personal or family history of convulsions, and the fact that convulsions following measles vaccine are uncommon and have not been associated with permanent brain damage. The Committee concluded that the benefits of vaccinating these children greatly outweigh the risks. They should be vaccinated just as children without such histories\n【79】 - Children who are being treated with anticonvulsants should continue to take them after measles vaccination. Because protective levels of most currently available anticonvulsant drugs (e.g., phenobarbitol) are not achieved for some time after therapy is initiated, prophylactic use of these drugs does not seem feasible\n【80】 - The parents of children who have either a personal or family history of seizures should be advised of the small increased risk of seizures following measles vaccina tion. In particular, they should be told in advance what to do in the unlikely event that a seizure occurs. The permanent medical record should document that the small risk of postimmunization seizures and the benefits of vaccination have been discussed\n【81】 # Revaccination Risks\n【82】 - There is no evidence of increased risk from live measles vaccination in persons who are already immune to measles, as a result of either previous vaccination or natural disease\n【83】 # PRECAUTIONS AND CONTRAINDICATIONS Pregnancy\n【84】 - Live measles vaccine, when given as a component of MR or MMR, should not be given to women known to be pregnant or who are considering becoming pregnant within the next 3 months. Women who are given monovalent measles vaccine should not become pregnant for at least 30 days after vaccination. This precaution is based on the theoretical risk of fetal infection, although no evidence substantiates this theoretical risk. Considering the importance of protecting adolescents and young adults against measles, asking women if they are pregnant, excluding those who are, and explaining the theoretical risks to the others before vaccination are sufficient precautions\n【85】 # Febrile Illness\n【86】 - The decision to administer or delay vaccination because of a current or recent febrile illness depends largely on the cause of the illness and the severity of symptoms. Minor illnesses, such as a mild upper-respiratory infection with or without low-grade fever, are not contraindications for vaccination. For persons whose compliance with medical care cannot be assured, every opportunity should be taken to provide appropriate vaccinations\n【87】 - Children with moderate or severe febrile illnesses can be vaccinated as soon as they have recovered. This wait avoids superimposing adverse effects of vaccination on the underlying illness or mistakenly attributing a manifestation of the underlying illness to the vaccine. Performing routine physical examinations or measuring temperatures are not prerequisites for vaccinating infants and children who appear to be in good health. Asking the parent or guardian if the child is ill, postponing vaccination for children with moderate or severe febrile illnesses, and vaccinating those without contraindications are appropriate procedures in childhood immuniza tion programs\n【88】 # Allergies\n【89】 - Hypersensitivity reactions following the administration of live measles vaccine are rare. Most of these reactions are minor and consist of a wheal and flare or urticaria at the injection site. More than 170 million doses of measles vaccine have been distributed in the United States, but only five reported cases of immediate allergic reactions have occurred among children who had histories of anaphylactic reactions to egg ingestion. These reactions could potentially have been life threatening. Four children experienced difficulty in breathing, and one of these four had hypotension. Persons with a history of anaphylactic reactions (hives, swelling of the mouth and throat, difficulty in breathing, hypotension, and shock) following egg ingestion should be vaccinated only with extreme caution. Protocols have been developed for vacci nating such persons . However, persons are not at increased risk if they have egg allergies that are not anaphylactic in nature; they can be vaccinated in the usual manner. Persons with allergies only to chickens or feathers are not at increased risk of reaction to measles vaccination\n【90】 - MMR vaccine and its component vaccines contain trace amounts of neomycin. Although the amount present is less than that usually used for a skin test to determine hypersensitivity, persons who have experienced anaphylactic reactions to neomycin should not be given these vaccines. Most often, neomycin allergy is manifested by contact dermatitis rather than anaphylaxis. A history of contact dermatitis to neomy cin is not a contraindication to receiving measles vaccine. Live measles virus vaccine does not contain penicillin\n【91】 # Recent Administrationof IG\n【92】 - Vaccine virus replication and stimulation of immunity usually occurs 1-2 weeks after vaccination. When the live measles vaccine is given after IG or specific IG preparations, the vaccine virus might not replicate successfully, and the antibody response could be diminished. Measles vaccine should not be given for at least 6 weeks, and preferably for 3 months, after a person has been given IG, whole blood, or other antibody-containing blood products. If vaccine is given to a person who has received such products within the preceding 3 months, the dose should not be counted and the person should be revaccinated approximately 3 months later unless serologic testing indicates that measles-specific antibodies have been produced. For international travelers, measles vaccination should precede the administration of IG by at least 2 weeks to preclude interference with replication of the vaccine virus. If the interval between measles vaccination and subsequent administration of an IG preparation is <14 days, vaccination should be repeated 3 months later, unless serologic testing indicates that antibodies were produced\n【93】 # Tuberculosis\n【94】 - Tuberculosis may be exacerbated by natural measles infection. Live measles virus vaccine has not been shown to have such an effect. Tuberculin skin testing is not a prerequisite for measles vaccination. If tuberculin testing is needed for other reasons, it can be done the day of vaccination. Otherwise, the test should be postponed for 4-6 weeks, since measles vaccination may temporarily suppress tuberculin reactivity\n【95】 # Altered Immunocompetence\n【96】 - Replication of vaccine viruses can be enhanced in persons with immune-deficiency diseases and in persons with immunosuppression, as occurs with leukemia, lym phoma, generalized malignancy, or therapy with alkylating agents, antimetabolites, radiation, or large doses of corticosteroids. For this reason, patients with such conditions or therapies (except patients with symptomatic infection with human immunodeficiency virus ; see below) should not be given live measles virus vaccine\n【97】 - Patients with leukemia in remission who have not received chemotherapy for at least 3 months may receive live-virus vaccines. Short-term (<2 weeks), low-to moderate-dose systemic corticosteroid therapy, topical steroid therapy (e.g., nasal, skin), long-term alternate-day treatment with low to moderate doses of short-acting systemic steroids, and intra-articular, bursal, or tendon injection of corticosteroids are not immunosuppressive in their usual doses and do not contraindicate the adminis tration of measles vaccine\n【98】 - The growing number of infants and preschoolers with HIV infection has directed special attention to the appropriate immunization of such children. Asymptomatic children do not need to be evaluated and tested for HIV infection before decisions concerning vaccination are made. Asymptomatic HIV-infected persons in need of MMR should receive it. MMR should be considered for all symptomatic HIV-infected children, including children with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), since measles disease in these children can be severe. Limited data on MMR vaccination among both asymptomatic and symptomatic HIV-infected children indicate that MMR has not been associated with severe or unusual adverse events, although antibody responses have been unpredic\n【99】 - The administration of high-dose intravenous immune globulin (IGIV) at regular intervals to HIV-infected children is being studied to determine whether it will prevent a variety of infections. MMR vaccine may be ineffective if it is administered to a child who has received IGIV during the preceding 3 months\n【100】 # Managementof Patientswith Contraindicationsto Measles Vaccine\n【101】 - If immediate protection against measles is required for persons with contraindi cations to measles vaccination, passive immunization with IG, 0.25 ml/kg (0.11 ml/lb) of body weight (maximum dose = 15 ml), should be given as soon as possible after known exposure. Exposed symptomatic HIV-infected and other immunocompro mised persons should receive IG regardless of their previous vaccination status; however, IG in usual doses may not be effective in such patients. For immunocom promised persons, the recommended dose is 0.5 ml/kg of body weight if IG is administered intramuscularly (maximum dose = 15 ml). This corresponds to a dose of protein of approximately 82.5 mg/kg (maximum dose = 2,475 mg). Intramuscular IG may not be needed if a patient with HIV infection is receiving 100-400 mg/kg IGIV at regular intervals and the last dose was given within 3 weeks of exposure to measles. Because the amounts of protein administered are similar, high-dose IGIV may be as effective as IG given intramuscularly. However, no data are available concerning the effectiveness of IGIV in preventing measles\n【102】 # Simultaneous Administrationof Vaccines\n【103】 - In general, simultaneous administration of the most widely used live and inacti vated vaccines does not impair antibody responses or increase rates of adverse reactions . The administration of MMR vaccine yields results similar to the administration of individual measles, mumps, and rubella vaccines at different sites or at different times\n【104】 - There are equivalent antibody responses and no clinically significant increases in the frequency of adverse events when DTP, MMR, and OPV or inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) are administered either simultaneously at different sites or at separate times. Routine simultaneous administration of MMR, DTP, and OPV (or IPV) is recommended for all children 2*15 months of age who are eligible to receive these vaccines . Vaccination with MMR at 15 months followed by DTP, OPV (or IPV), and Haemophilus influenzae b conjugate vaccine (HbCV) at 18 months remains an accepalternative for children with caregivers known to be generally compliant with other health-care recommendations. No data are available on the concomitant administration of HbCV or H. influenzae b polysaccharide vaccine (HbPV) and OPV and MMR vaccine. If the child might not be brought back for future vaccinations, the simultaneous administration of all vaccines (including DTP, OPV, MMR, and HbCV or HbPV) is recommended, as appropriate to the recipient's age and previous vaccina tion status\n【105】 # OUTBREAK CONTROL\n【106】 - All reports of suspected measles cases should be investigated promptly. A measles outbreak exists in a community whenever one case of measles is confirmed. Once this occurs, preventing the dissemination of measles depends on the prompt vaccination of susceptible persons. Control activities should not be delayed for laboratory results on suspected cases. Persons who cannot readily provide documen tation of measles immunity  should be vaccinated or excluded from the setting (e.g., school). Documentation of vaccination is adequate only if the date of vaccination is provided. Almost all persons who are excluded from an outbreak area because they lack documentation of immunity quickly comply with vaccination requirements. Persons who have been exempted from measles vaccina tion for medical, religious, or other reasons should be excluded from the outbreak area until at least 2 weeks after the onset of rash in the last case of measles\n【107】 # School-based Outbreaks\n【108】 - During outbreaks in day-care centers; elementary, middle, junior, and senior high schools; and colleges and other institutions of higher education, a program of revaccination with MMR vaccine is recommended in the affected schools. Consider ation should be given to revaccination in unaffected schools that may be at risk of measles transmission. Revaccination should include all students and their siblings and all school personnel born in or after 1957 who cannot provide documentation that they received two doses of measles-containing vaccine on or after their first birthday or other evidence of measles immunity . Persons revacci nated, as well as unvaccinated persons receiving their first dose as part of the outbreak control program, may be immediately readmitted to school. Mass revacci nation of entire communities is not necessary\n【109】 # Quarantine\n【110】 - Imposing quarantine measures for outbreak control is both difficult and disruptive to schools and other organizations. Under special circumstances restriction of an event might be warranted; however, such action is not recommended as a routine measure for outbreak control\n【111】 # Outbreaks Among Preschool-aged Children\n【112】 - The risk of complications from measles is high among infants <1 year of age. Therefore, considering the benefits and risks, vaccination with monovalent measles vaccine is recommended for infants as young as 6 months of age when exposure to natural measles is considered likely. MMR may be administered to children before the first birthday if monovalent measles vaccine is not readily available. Children vaccinated before the first birthday should be revaccinated when they are 15 months old and when they enter school to ensure adequate protection\n【113】 # Medical Settings\n【114】 - If an outbreak occurs in the areas served by a hospital or within a hospital, all employees with direct patient contact who were born in or after 1957 who cannot provide documentation they they received two doses of measles vaccine on or after their first birthday or other evidence of im m unity to measles  should receive a dose of measles vaccine. Since some medical personnel who have acquired measles in medical facilities were born before 1957, vaccination of older employees who may have occupational exposure to measles should also be considered during outbreaks. Susceptible personnel who have been exposed should be relieved from direct patient contact from the fifth to the 21st day after exposure regardless of whether they received vaccine or IG after the exposure. Personnel who become ill should be relieved from patient contact for 7 days after they develop rash\n【115】 # DISEASE SURVEILLANCE AND REPORTING OF ADVERSE EVENTS Disease Surveillance\n【116】 - As the incidence of measles declines in the United States, aggressive surveillance becomes increasingly important. Effective surveillance can delineate inadequate levels of protection, define groups needing special attention, and assess the effec tiveness of control activities\n【117】 - Known or suspected measles cases should be reported immediately to local health departments. Serologic confirmation should be attempted for every suspected case of measles that cannot be linked to a confirmed case. Reporting of suspected cases and implementation of outbreak-control activities should not be delayed pending laboratory results\n【118】 - The traditional serologic diagnosis of measles requires a significant rise in antibody titer between acute-and convalescent-phase sera. However, the diagnosis can also be made by demonstrating the presence of IgM antibody in a single specimen. Correct interpretation of serologic data depends upon the proper timing of specimen collection in relation to rash onset. This timing is especially important for interpreting negative IgM results, since IgM antibody peaks approximately 10 days after rash onset and is usually undetec days after rash onset\n【119】 - Asymptomatic reinfection can occur in persons who have previously developed antibodies, whether from vaccination or from natural disease. Symptomatic reinfec tions are rare. These reinfections have been accompanied by rises in measles antibody titers\n【120】 # Reportingof Adverse Events\n【121】 - The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 requires physicians and other health care providers who administer vaccines to maintain permanent immunization records and to report occurrences of adverse events specified in the Act . These adverse events, as well as other adverse events that require medical attention, must be reported to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Although there eventually will be one system for reporting adverse events following immunizations, two separate systems currently exist. The appropriate reporting method depends on the source of funding used to purchase the vaccine. If a vaccine was purchased with public funds, adverse events should be reported to the appropriate local, county, or state health department. The state health department submits its report to CDC. If vaccine was purchased with private money, adverse events should be reported directly to the Food and Drug Administration", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": "语义不完整#17#17#描述的不完整", "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-15 17:51:30", "update_time": "2024-04-15 18:23:55"}

A bioavailability study of Tindamax ts was conducted in adult healthy volunteers. All subjects received a single oral dose of 2 g (four 500 mg ts) of Tindamax following an overnight fast. Oral administration of four 500 mg ts of Tindamax under fasted conditions produced a mean peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of 47.7 (±7.5) µg/mL with a mean time to peak concentration (Tmax) of 1.6 (±0.7) hours, and a mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC, 0-∞) of 901.6 (± 126.5) µg/hr/mL at 72 hours. The elimination half-life (T1/2) was 13.2 (±1.4) hours. Mean plasma levels decreased to 14.3 µg/mL at 24 hours, 3.8 µg/mL at 48 hours and 0.8 µg/mL at 72 hours following administration. Steady-state conditions are reached in 2½ - 3 days of multi-day dosing\n【7】 - Administration of Tindamax ts with food resulted in a delay in Tmax of approximately 2 hours and a decline in Cmax of approximately 10%, compared to fasted conditions. However, administration of Tindamax with food did not affect AUC or T1/2 in this study\n【8】 - In healthy volunteers, administration of crushed Tindamax ts in artificial cherry syrup,  after an overnight fast had no effect on any pharmacokinetic parameter as compared to ts swallowed whole under fasted conditions\n【9】 - Distribution\n【10】 - Tinidazole is distributed into virtually all tissues and body fluids and also crosses the blood-brain barrier. The apparent volume of distribution is about 50 liters. Plasma protein binding of tinidazole is 12%. Tinidazole crosses the placental barrier and is secreted in breast milk\n【11】 - Metabolism\n【12】 - Tinidazole is significantly metabolized in humans prior to excretion. Tinidazole is partly metabolized by oxidation, hydroxylation, and conjugation. Tinidazole is the major drug-related constituent in plasma after human treatment, along with a small amount of the 2-hydroxymethyl metabolite\n【13】 - Tinidazole is biotransformed mainly by CYP3A4. In an in vitro metabolic drug interaction study, tinidazole concentrations of up to 75 µg/mL did not inhibit the enzyme activities of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4\n【14】 - The potential of tinidazole to induce the metabolism of other drugs has not been evaluated\n【15】 - Elimination\n【16】 - The plasma half-life of tinidazole is approximately 12-14 hours. Tinidazole is excreted by the liver and the kidneys. Tinidazole is excreted in the urine mainly as unchanged drug (approximately 20-25% of the administered dose). Approximately 12% of the drug is excreted in the feces\n【17】 - Patients with impaired renal function: The pharmacokinetics of tinidazole in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCL < 22 mL/min) are not significantly different from the pharmacokinetics seen in healthy subjects. However, during hemodialysis, clearance of tinidazole is significantly increased; the half-life is reduced from 12.0 hours to 4.9 hours. Approximately 43% of the amount present in the body is eliminated during a 6-hour hemodialysis session. The pharmacokinetics of tinidazole in patients undergoing routine continuous peritoneal dialysis have not been investigated\n【18】 - Patients with impaired hepatic function: There are no data on tinidazole pharmacokinetics in patients with impaired hepatic function.

Founded in 1935 and located in New Haven, Connecticut since 1970, Haskins Laboratories is a private, non-profit research institute with a primary focus on speech, language and reading, and their biological basis. Haskins Laboratories has a long history of technological and theoretical innovation, from creating the rules for speech synthesis and the first working prototype of a reading machine for the blind to developing the landmark concept of phonemic awareness as a critical preparation for learning to read\n【2】 # History\n【3】 - Scores of researchers have contributed to scientific breakthroughs at Haskins Laboratories since its founding. All of them are indebted to the pioneering work and leadership of Caryl Parker Haskins , Franklin S. Cooper , Alvin Liberman , Seymour Hutner  and Luigi Provasoli . This history focuses on the research program of the main division of Haskins Laboratories that, since the 1940s, has been most well known for its work in the areas of speech, language and reading\n【4】 ## 1930s\n【5】 - Caryl Haskins and Franklin S. Cooper established Haskins Laboratories in 1935. It was originally affiliated with Harvard University, MIT, and Union College in Schenectady, NY. Caryl Haskins conducted research in microbiology, radiation physics, and other fields in Cambridge, MA and Schenectady. In 1939 the Laboratories moved its center to New York City. Seymour Hutner joined the staff to set up a research program in microbiology, genetics, and nutrition. The descendant of this program is now part of Pace University in New York\n【6】 ## 1940s\n【7】 - The U. S. Office of Scientific Research and Development, under Vannevar Bush asked Haskins Laboratories to evaluate and develop technologies for assisting blinded World War II veterans. Experimental psychologist Alvin Liberman joined the Laboratories to assist in developing a \"sound alphabet\" to represent the letters in a text for use in a reading machine for the blind. Luigi Provasoli joined the Laboratories to set up a research program in marine biology. The program in marine biology moved to Yale University in 1970 and disbanded with Provasoli's retirement in 1978\n【8】 ## 1950s\n【9】 - Franklin S. Cooper invented the pattern playback, a machine that converts pictures of the acoustic patterns of speech back into sound. With this device, Alvin Liberman, Cooper, and Pierre Delattre  (later joined by Katherine Safford Harris , Leigh Lisker  and others), discovered the acoustic cues for the perception of phonetic segments (consonants and vowels). Liberman and colleagues proposed a \"motor theory\"  of speech perception to resolve the acoustic complexity: they hypothesized that we perceive speech by tapping into a biological specialization, a speech module, that contains knowledge of the acoustic consequences of articulation. Liberman, aided by Frances Ingemann and others, organized the results of the work on speech cues into a groundbreaking set of rules for speech synthesis by the Pattern Playback\n【10】 ## 1960s\n【11】 - Franklin S. Cooper and Katherine Safford Harris, working with Peter MacNeilage , were the first researchers in the U.S. to use electromyographic techniques, pioneered at the University of Tokyo, to study the neuromuscular organization of speech. Leigh Lisker and Arthur Abramson looked for simplification at the level of articulatory action in the voicing of certain contrasting consonants. They showed that many acoustic properties of voicing contrasts arise from variations in voice onset time, the relative phasing of the onset of vocal cord vibration and the end of a consonant. Their work has been widely replicated and elaborated, here and abroad, over the following decades. Donald Shankweiler  and Michael Studdert-Kennedy  used a dichotic listening technique (presenting different nonsense syllables simultaneously to opposite ears) to demonstrate the dissociation of phonetic (speech) and auditory (nonspeech) perception by finding that phonetic structure devoid of meaning is an integral part of language, typically processed in the left cerebral hemisphere. Liberman, Cooper, Shankweiler, and Studdert-Kennedy summarized and interpreted fifteen years of research in \"Perception of the Speech Code,\" still among the most cited papers in the speech literature. It set the agenda for many years of research at Haskins and elsewhere by describing speech as a code in which speakers overlap (or coarticulate) segments to form syllables. Researchers at Haskins connected their first computer to a speech synthesizer designed by the Laboratories' engineers. Ignatius Mattingly , with British collaborators, John N. Holmes  and J.N. Shearme , adapted the Pattern playback rules to write the first computer program for synthesizing continuous speech from a phonetically spelled input. A further step toward a reading machine for the blind combined Mattingly's program with an automatic look-up procedure for converting alphabetic text into strings of phonetic symbols\n【12】 ## 1970s\n【13】 - In 1970 Haskins Laboratories moved to New Haven, Connecticut and entered into affiliation agreements with Yale University and the University of Connecticut. Isabelle Liberman, Donald Shankweiler, and Alvin Liberman teamed up with Ignatius Mattingly to study the relationship between speech perception and reading, a topic implicit in the Laboratories' research program since its inception. They developed the concept of phonemic awareness, the knowledge that would-be readers must have of the phonemic structure of their language in order to be able to read. Under the broad rubric of the \"alphabetic principle,\" this is the core of the Laboratories' present program of reading pedagogy. Patrick Nye  joined the Laboratories to lead a team working on the reading machine for the blind. The project culminated when the addition of an optical character recognizer allowed investigators to assemble the first automatic text-to-speech reading machine. By the end of the decade this technology had advanced to the point where commercial concerns assumed the task of designing and manufacturing reading machines for the blind\n【14】 - In 1973 Franklin S. Cooper was selected to form a panel of six experts charged with investigating the famous 18-minute gap in the White House office tapes of President Richard Nixon related to the Watergate scandal\n【15】 - Building on earlier work, Philip Rubin developed the sinewave synthesis program, which was then used by Robert Remez, Rubin,  and colleagues to show that listeners can perceive continuous speech without traditional speech cues from a pattern of sinewaves that track the changing resonances of the vocal tract. This paved the way for a view of speech as a dynamic pattern of trajectories through articulatory-acoustic space. Philip Rubin and colleagues developed Paul Mermelstein's anatomically simplied vocal tract model , originally worked on at Bell Laboratories, into the first articulatory synthesizer  that can be controlled in a physically meaningful way and used for interactive experiments\n【16】 ## 1980s\n【17】 - Studies of different writing systems supported the controversial hypothesis that all reading necessarily activates the phonological form of a word before, or at the same time, as its meaning. Work included experiments by George Lukatela , Michael Turvey , Leonard Katz , Ram Frost , Laurie Feldman  and Shlomo Bentin , in a variety of languages. Various researchers developed compatible theoretical accounts of speech production, speech perception and phonological knowledge. Carol Fowler proposed a direct realism theory of speech perception: listeners perceive gestures not by means of a specialized decoder, as in the motor theory, but because information in the acoustic signal specifies the gestures that form it. J. A. Scott Kelso and colleagues demonstrated functional synergies in speech gestures experimentally. Elliot Saltzman  developed a dynamical systems theory of synergetic action and implemented the theory as a working model of speech production. Linguists Catherine Browman and Louis Goldstein  developed the theory of articulatory phonology , in which gestures are the basic units of both phonetic action and phonological knowledge. Articulatory phonology, the task dynamic model, and the articulatory synthesis model are combined into a gestural computational model of speech production.  Saltzman and Rubin started the IS group to explore cutting edge developments in science and technology and foster collaboration across institutions and disciplines. The group, not formally affiliated with Haskins Laboratories, continues to meet\n【18】 ## 1990s\n【19】 - Katherine Safford Harris, Frederica Bell-Berti and colleagues studied the phasing and cohesion of articulatory speech gestures. Kenneth Pugh was among the first scientists to use functional magnetic resonance imaging  to reveal brain activity associated with reading and reading disabilities. Pugh, Donald Shankweiler , Weija Ni, Einar Mencl , and colleagues developed novel applications of neuroimaging to measure brain activity associated with understanding sentences. Philip Rubin, Louis Goldstein and Mark Tiede designed a radical revision of the articulatory synthesis model, known as CASY , the configurable articulatory synthesizer. This 3-dimensional model of the vocal tract permits researchers to replicate MRI images of actual speakers. Douglas Whalen , Goldstein, Rubin and colleagues extended this work to study the relation between speech production and perception.  Donald Shankweiler, Susan Brady  ,  Anne Fowler , and others explored whether weak memory and perception in poor readers are tied specifically to phonological deficits. Evidence rejected broader cognitive deficits underlying reading difficulties and raised questions about impaired phonological representations in disabled readers\n【20】 ## 2000s\n【21】 - Anne Fowler and Susan Brady  launched the Early Reading Success (ERS) program , part of the Haskins Literacy Initiative which promotes the science of teaching reading. The ERS program was a demonstration project examining the efficacy of professional development in reading instruction for teachers of children in kindergarten through second grade. The Mastering Reading Instruction program , which combines professional development with Haskins-trained mentors, was a continuation of ERS. David Ostry  and colleagues explored the neurological underpinning of motor control using a robot arm to influence jaw movement. Douglas Whalen and Khalil Iskarous  pioneered the pairing of ultrasound, used here to monitor articulators that cannot be seen, and Optotrak, an opto-electronic position-tracking device, used here to monitor visible articulators. Donald Shankweiler  and David Braze  developed an eye movement laboratory that combines eye tracking data with brain activity measures for investigating reading processes in normal and disabled readers. In March 2005 Haskins Laboratories moved to a new state-of-the-art facility on George Street in New Haven\n【22】 # Also see (people)\n【23】 - Arthur S.

It participates in electrolyte and fluid balance through reabsorption and excretion, processes regulated by the hormones aldosterone and antidiuretic hormone\n【2】 - Anatomically, there are several components of the collecting duct system, including the connecting tubules, cortical collecting ducts, and medullary collecting ducts\n【3】 # Function\n【4】 - The collecting duct system is the last component of the kidney to influence the body's electrolyte and fluid balance. In humans, the system accounts for 4-5% of the kidney's reabsorption of sodium and 5% of the kidney's reabsorption of water. At times of extreme dehydration, over 24% of the filtered water may be reabsorbed in the collecting duct system\n【5】 - The wide variation in water reabsorption levels for the collecting duct system reflects its dependence on hormonal activation. The collecting ducts, particularly the outer medullary and cortical collecting ducts, are largely impermeable to water without the presence of antidiuretic hormone (ADH, or vasopressin)\n【6】 - In the absence of ADH, water in the renal filtrate is left alone to enter the urine, promoting diuresis\n【7】 - When ADH is present, aquaporins allow for the reabsorption of this water, thereby inhibiting diuresis\n【8】 - The collecting duct system participates in the regulation of other electrolytes, including chloride, potassium, hydrogen ions, and bicarbonate\n【9】 # Anatomy\n【10】 - The parts of the system are as follows:\n【11】 - The connecting tubule derives from the metanephric blastema, but the rest of the system derives from the ureteric bud. Because of this, some sources group the connecting tubule as part of the nephron, rather than grouping it with the collecting duct system\n【12】 # Cell types\n【13】 - Each component of the collecting duct system contains two cell types, intercalated cells and a segment-specific cell type:\n【14】 - For the connecting tubules, this specific cell type is the connecting tubule cell\n【15】 - For the collecting ducts, it is the principal cell. The inner medullary collecting ducts contain an additional cell type, called the inner medullary collecting duct cell\n【16】 ## Principal cells\n【17】 - The principal cell mediates the collecting duct's influence on sodium and potassium balance via sodium channels and potassium channels located on the cell's apical membrane. Aldosterone determines if the sodium channels transport ions\n【18】 ## Intercalated cells\n【19】 - Intercalated cells come in α and β varieties and participate in acid-base homeostasis\n【20】 - For their contribution to acid-base homeostasis, the intercalated cells play important roles in the kidney's response to acidosis and alkalosis. Damage to the α-intercalated cell's ability to secrete acid can result in distal renal tubular acidosis (RTA type I, classical RTA)\n【21】 # Additional images\n【22】 - Transverse section of pyramidal substance of kidney of pig, the bloodvessels of which are injected\n【23】 - Alpha intercalated cell cartoon", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-15 17:51:30", "update_time": "2024-04-15 18:28:09"}

The evidence did not show any difference in effectiveness between enema and suppository\n【215】 - Topical aminosalicylates alone are recommended for up to 4 weeks because the evidence showed that they were the most effective treatment within this timeframe. There was no direct evidence for combining topical and oral aminosalicylates for people with proctitis. However, evidence showed that this combination was effective for people with proctosigmoiditis, and the committee agreed that this evidence was also applicable to people with proctitis alone. The committee chose not to specify a dose for the oral aminosalicylate. It preferred to leave it open to clinical judgment depending on the specific situation (for example, the clinician could give a low dose if the person had not taken an aminosalicylate before, or a high dose if the person was already taking a low dose)\n【216】 - Some people will not achieve remission with topical and oral aminosalicylates. In clinical practice, oral or topical corticosteroids are commonly added at this stage, but there was no evidence on this combination. The committee agreed that, based on their experience, adding a topical or oral corticosteroid should be an option at this stage\n【217】 - Despite the lack of direct evidence for the effectiveness of topical or oral corticosteroids, the committee agreed that, based on their experience, these should also be an option for people who cannot tolerate aminosalicylates\n【218】 - Some people decline topical treatment, preferring oral to topical aminosalicylates. This is more common in children and young people, although proctitis is not common in this group. As the evidence showed that oral aminosalicylates are not as effective at inducing remission, the committee thought it was important to explain this to people who decline topical aminosalicylates\n【219】 - There was cost-effectiveness evidence showing that using an immunomodulator as the next line of treatment after oral or topical corticosteroids and oral aminosalicylate produced greater health benefits at lower total costs than other strategies. However, the clinical evidence on topical immunomodulators was limited and it was unclear how applicable it was to UK clinical practice. Because of this, the committee recommended the sequence without this final treatment, and made a research recommendation on topical immunomodulators\n【220】 - There is evidence that topical aminosalicylates are effective for achieving remission in people with mild-to-moderate proctosigmoiditis or left-sided ulcerative colitis. In the committee's experience topical aminosalicylates also work faster and more effectively than topical corticosteroids. Topical aminosalicylates alone are recommended for up to 4 weeks because the evidence showed that they were effective within this timeframe. Cost-effectiveness evidence also showed that treatment sequences starting with topical aminosalicylates produced greater health benefits and incurred lower total costs than other strategies\n【221】 - There is no direct evidence for the effectiveness of high-dose oral aminosalicylates combined with either topical aminosalicylates or topical corticosteroids. However, there is evidence that topical treatments or high-dose oral aminosalicylates individually provide some benefit. Therefore, the committee agreed it was reasonable to recommend combinations of these if remission is not achieved. While there was limited evidence for oral corticosteroids, in the committee's experience an oral corticosteroid may benefit people with proctosigmoiditis or left-sided disease if further treatment is needed. As a result, they recommended oral corticosteroids with oral aminosalicylates instead of topical treatment for these people. This reflects current practice for people who do not achieve remission with topical treatments and high-dose oral aminosalicylates\n【222】 - The evidence showed that people with mild-to-moderate extensive ulcerative colitis would benefit most from a combination of high-dose oral aminosalicylates with topical aminosalicylates as first-line treatment. High-dose oral aminosalicylates combined with topical aminosalicylates are recommended for up to 4 weeks, because in the committee's experience they are the most effective treatment within this timeframe. There is evidence that an oral corticosteroid combined with a high-dose oral aminosalicylate is also effective, so the committee recommended this combination if remission is not achieved with aminosalicylates alone. In people who cannot tolerate aminosalicylates, oral corticosteroids are recommended as they are also an effective treatment option\n【223】 - The sequence of drugs recommended was more effective than starting with a high-dose oral aminosalicylate alone. There was some uncertainty around the cost effectiveness of this sequence. The data on the effectiveness of high-dose oral aminosalicylates combined with topical aminosalicylates was from an 8‑week clinical trial. The committee believed that in practice, people whose disease did not respond to treatment within 4 weeks would switch to another treatment. When the cost-effectiveness analysis allowed for early switching, the combination of a high-dose oral aminosalicylate and topical aminosalicylate was not cost effective. However, if it was assumed that everyone continued treatment as described in the trial, the combination of a high-dose oral aminosalicylate and topical aminosalicylate was more likely to be cost effective. The committee took the uncertainty about the cost-effectiveness results in the different scenarios into account in recommending the combination as first-line treatment\n【224】 - There was some evidence on methotrexate for inducing remission, but it did not show a clear benefit, and there was no evidence on oral tacrolimus. To address these gaps in the evidence, the committee made a research recommendation on the effectiveness of immunomodulators in unresponsive ulcerative colitis\n【225】 - Most of the evidence was for adults. However, the committee agreed to generalise the recommendations to all people with a mild-to-moderate exacerbation or first presentation of ulcerative colitis\n【226】 - There is limited evidence on oral corticosteroids. In addition, the committee agreed that the use of oral corticosteroids is generally reserved for later lines of treatment because of concerns about side effects. It is not clear which corticosteroid is most effective for each extent of disease. There is also limited evidence on immunomodulators, specifically oral tacrolimus and systemic methotrexate for each extent of disease. The committee made a research recommendation on corticosteroids for the induction of remission in mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis to address these uncertainties\n【227】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\n【228】 - The new recommendations classify the extents of ulcerative colitis differently. This more closely reflects current practice, so will be clearer and more informative for people with mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis and healthcare professionals\n【229】 - The recommendations in the 2013 guideline referred to specific corticosteroids. To better reflect the available evidence, the updated recommendations  aminosalicylates and corticosteroids as a class rather than recommending individual treatments. This allows healthcare professionals and people with mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis to choose the most appropriate corticosteroid or aminosalicylate, depending on patient preference, availability and acquisition cost\n【230】 - The new recommendations specify that courses of oral corticosteroids should be time-limited. This should address varying practice in prescribing for some corticosteroids\n【231】 - # Context\n【232】 - Ulcerative colitis is the most common type of inflammatory bowel disease. There are around 146,000 people in the UK with a diagnosis of ulcerative colitis (Crohn's & Colitis UK). The cause of ulcerative colitis is unknown. It can develop at any age, but peak incidence is between the ages of 15 and 25 years, with a second, smaller peak between 55 and 65 years (although this second peak has not been universally demonstrated)\n【233】 - Ulcerative colitis usually affects the rectum, and a variable extent of the colon proximal to the rectum. The inflammation is continuous in extent. Inflammation of the rectum is referred to as proctitis, and inflammation of the rectum and sigmoid as proctosigmoiditis. Left-sided colitis refers to disease involving the colon distal to the splenic flexure. Extensive colitis affects the colon proximal to the splenic flexure, and includes pan-colitis, where the whole colon is involved\n【234】 - Symptoms of active disease or relapse include bloody diarrhoea, an urgent need to defecate and abdominal pain\n【235】 - Ulcerative colitis is a lifelong disease that is associated with significant morbidity. It can also affect a person's social and psychological wellbeing, particularly if poorly controlled. Typically, it has a relapsing-remitting pattern\n【236】 - Current medical approaches focus on treating active disease to address symptoms, to improve quality of life, and thereafter to maintain remission. The long-term benefits of achieving mucosal healing remain unclear. The treatment chosen for active disease is likely to depend on clinical severity, extent of disease and the person's preference, and may include the use of aminosalicylates, corticosteroids or biological drugs. These drugs can be oral or topical (into the rectum), and corticosteroids may be administered intravenously in people with acute severe disease. Surgery may be considered as emergency treatment for severe ulcerative colitis that does not respond to drug treatment. People may also choose to have elective surgery for unresponsive or frequently relapsing disease that is affecting their quality of life\n【237】 - Advice and support for people with ulcerative colitis is important, in terms of discussing the effects of the condition and its course, medical treatment options, the effects of medication and the monitoring required. Around 10% of inpatients with inflammatory bowel disease reported a lack of information about drug side effects on discharge from hospital. Information to support decisions about surgery is also essential, both for clinicians and for people facing the possibility of surgery. This includes recognising adverse prognostic factors for people admitted with acute severe colitis to enable timely decisions about escalating medical therapy or predicting the need for surgery. It is also very important to provide relevant information to support people considering elective surgery\n【238】 - The wide choice of drug preparations and dosing regimens, the judgement required in determining the optimum timing for surgery (both electively and as an emergency) and the importance of support and information may lead to variation in practice across the UK. This guideline aims to address this variation, and to help healthcare professionals to provide consistent high-quality care. Managing ulcerative colitis in adults and children overlaps in many regards, so the guideline incorporates advice that is applicable to children and young people, which again should help to address potential inconsistencies in practice", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": "缺少换行#173#173# Recommendations for research小标题另起一行\n缺少换行#209#209# Rationale and impact小标题另起一行\n", "type3": "无关文本#8#8#Refer to the NICE guideline on medicines adherence\n无关文本#33#33#Loading.

Common adverse reactions include ataxia, coordination problem, dizziness, somnolence, behavior problem, upper respiratory infection, fatigue\n【5】 # Adult Indicationsand Dosage\n【6】 # FDA-Labeled Indicationsand Dosage( Adult)\n【7】 ### Seizure Disorders\n【8】 - Dosing information\n【9】 - Adults\n【10】 - Initial dose: not exceed 1.5 mg PO tid. Dosage may be increased in increments of 0.5 mg to 1 mg every 3 days until  seizures are adequately controlled or until side effects preclude any further increase. Maintenance dosage must be individualized for each patient depending upon response. Maximum recommended daily dose is 20 mg\n【11】 - The use of multiple anticonvulsants may result in an increase of depressant adverse effects. This should be considered before adding clonazepam ts to an existing anticonvulsant regimen\n【12】 - Geriatric Patients\n【13】 - There is no clinical trial experience with clonazepam ts in seizure disorder patients 65 years of age and older. In general, elderly patients should be started on low doses of clonazepam ts and observed closely\n【14】 ### Panic disorder\n【15】 - Dosing införmation\n【16】 - Adults\n【17】 - Initial dose: 0.25 mg bid. An increase to the target dose for most patients of 1 mg/day may be made after 3 days\n【18】 - Recommended dose: 1 mg/day is based on the results from a fixed dose study in which the optimal effect was seen at 1 mg/day. Higher doses of 2 mg/day, 3 mg/day and 4 mg/day in that study were less effective than the 1 mg/day dose and were associated with more adverse effects\n【19】 - Maximum dosage: 4 mg/day, and in those instances, the dose may be increased in increments of 0.125 mg to 0.25 mg bid every 3 days until  panic disorder  is controlled or until side effects make further increases undesired. To reduce the inconvenience of somnolence, administration of one dose at bedtime may be desirable\n【20】 - Treatment should be discontinued gradually, with a decrease of 0.125 mg bid every 3 days, until the drug is completely withdrawn\n【21】 - There is no body of evidence available to answer the question of how long the patient treated with clonazepam should remain on it. Therefore, the physician who elects to use clonazepam ts for extended periods should periodically reevaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient\n【22】 - Geriatric Patients\n【23】 - There is no clinical trial experience with clonazepam ts in panic disorder  patients 65 years of age and older.

In order to minimize drowsiness, the initial dose for infants and children (up to 10 years of age or 30 kg of body weight) should be between 0.01 mg/kg/day and 0.03 mg/kg/day but not to exceed 0.05 mg/kg/day given in two or three divided doses. Dosage should be increased by no more than 0.25 mg to 0.5 mg every third day until a daily maintenance dose of 0.1 mg/kg to 0.2 mg/kg of body weight has been reached, unless seizures are controlled or side effects preclude further increase. Whenever possible, the daily dose should be divided into three equal doses. If doses are not equally divided, the largest dose should be given before retiring\n【42】 ### Panic Disorder\n【43】 - Dosing information\n【44】 - There is no clinical trial experience with clonazepam ts in panic disorder patients under 18 years of age\n【45】 # Off-Label Useand Dosage( Pediatric)\n【46】 # Guideline-Supported Use\n【47】 - There is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of clonazepam in pediatric patients\n【48】 # Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n【49】 - There is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of clonazepam in pediatric patients\n【50】 # Contraindications\n【51】 - Clonazepam should not be used in patients with a history of sensitivity to benzodiazepines, nor in patients with clinical or biochemical evidence of significant liver disease. It may be used in patients with open angle glaucoma who are receiving appropriate therapy but is contraindicated in acute narrow angle glaucoma\n【52】 # Warnings\n【53】 - Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance\n【54】 - Since clonazepam produces CNS depression, patients receiving this drug should be cautioned against engaging in hazardous occupations requiring mental alertness, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. They should also be warned about the concomitant use of alcohol or other CNS-depressant drugs during clonazepam therapy\n【55】 - Suicidal Behavior and Ideation\n【56】 - Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including clonazepam, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior\n【57】 - Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43% compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide\n【58】 - The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed\n【59】 - The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed\n【60】 -  shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs\n【61】 - The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications\n【62】 - Anyone considering prescribing clonazepam or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated\n【63】 - Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers\n【64】 ### Pregnancy Risks\n【65】 - Data from several sources raise concerns about the use of clonazepam during pregnancy\n【66】 - Animal Findings\n【67】 - In three studies in which clonazepam was administered orally to pregnant rabbits at doses of 0.2 mg/kg/day, 1 mg/kg/day, 5 mg/kg/day or 10 mg/kg/day (low dose approximately 0.2 times the maximum recommended human dose of 20 mg/day for seizure disorders and equivalent to the maximum dose of 4 mg/day for panic disorder, on a mg/m2 basis) during the period of organogenesis, a similar pattern of malformations (cleft palate, open eyelid, fused sternebrae and limb defects) was observed in a low, non-dose-related incidence in exposed litters from all dosage groups. Reductions in maternal weight gain occurred at dosages of 5 mg/kg/day or greater and reduction in embryo-fetal growth occurred in one study at a dosage of 10 mg/kg/day. No adverse maternal or embryo-fetal effects were observed in mice and rats following administration during organogenesis of oral doses up to 15 mg/kg/day or 40 mg/kg/day, respectively (4 and 20 times the maximum recommended human dose of 20 mg/day for seizure disorders and 20 and 100 times the maximum dose of 4 mg/day for panic disorder, respectively, on a mg/m2 basis)\n【68】 - General Concerns and Considerations about Anticonvulsants\n【69】 - Recent reports suggest an association between the use of anticonvulsant drugs by women with epilepsy and an elevated incidence of birth defects in children born to these women. Data are more extensive with respect to diphenylhydantoin and phenobarbital, but these are also the most commonly prescribed anticonvulsants; less systematic or anecdotal reports suggest a possible similar association with the use of all known anticonvulsant drugs\n【70】 - In children of women treated with drugs for epilepsy, reports suggesting an elevated incidence of birth defects cannot be regarded as adequate to prove a definite cause and effect relationship. There are intrinsic methodologic problems in obtaining adequate data on drug teratogenicity in humans; the possibility also exists that other factors, (e.g., genetic factors or the epileptic condition itself), may be more important than drug therapy in leading to birth defects. The great majority of mothers on anticonvulsant medication deliver normal infants. It is important to note that anticonvulsant drugs should not be discontinued in patients in whom the drug is administered to prevent seizures because of the strong possibility of precipitating status epilepticus with attendant hypoxia and threat to life. In individual cases where the severity and frequency of the seizure disorder are such that the removal of medication does not pose a serious threat to the patient, discontinuation of the drug may be considered prior to and during pregnancy; however, it cannot be said with any confidence that even mild seizures do not pose some hazards to the developing embryo or fetus\n【71】 - General Concerns about Benzodiazepines\n【72】 - An increased risk of congenital malformations associated with the use of benzodiazepine drugs has been suggested in several studies\n【73】 - There may also be non-teratogenic risks associated with the use of benzodiazepines during pregnancy. There have been reports of neonatal flaccidity, respiratory and feeding difficulties, and hypothermia in children born to mothers who have been receiving benzodiazepines late in pregnancy. In addition, children born to mothers receiving benzodiazepines late in pregnancy may be at some risk of experiencing withdrawal symptoms during the postnatal period\n【74】 - Advice Regarding the use of Clonazepam in Women of Childbearing Potential\n【75】 - In general, the use of clonazepam in women of childbearing potential, and more specifically during known pregnancy, should be considered only when the clinical situation warrants the risk to the fetus\n【76】 - The specific considerations addressed above regarding the use of anticonvulsants for epilepsy in women of childbearing potential should be weighed in treating or counseling these women\n【77】 - Because of experience with other members of the benzodiazepine class, clonazepam is assumed to be capable of causing an increased risk of congenital abnormalities when administered to a pregnant woman during the first trimester. Because use of these drugs is rarely a matter of urgency in the treatment of panic disorder, their use during the first trimester should almost always be avoided. The possibility that a woman of childbearing potential may be pregnant at the time of institution of therapy should be considered. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Patients should also be advised that if they become pregnant during therapy or intend to become pregnant, they should communicate with their physician about the desirability of discontinuing the drug\n【78】 ### Withdrawal Symptoms\n【79】 - Withdrawal symptoms of the barbiturate type have occurred after the discontinuation of benzodiazepines\n【80】 # PRECAUTIONS\n【81】 ## General\n【82】 - Worsening of Seizures\n【83】 - When used in patients in whom several different types of seizure disorders coexist, clonazepam may increase the incidence or precipitate the onset of generalized tonic-clonic seizures (grand mal). This may require the addition of appropriate anticonvulsants or an increase in their dosages. The concomitant use of valproic acid and clonazepam may produce absence status\n【84】 - Laboratory Testing during Long-Term Therapy\n【85】 - Periodic blood counts and liver function tests are advisable during long-term therapy with clonazepam\n【86】 - Risks of Abrupt Withdrawal\n【87】 - The abrupt withdrawal of clonazepam, particularly in those patients on long-term, high-dose therapy, may precipitate status epilepticus. Therefore, when discontinuing clonazepam, gradual withdrawal is essential. While clonazepam is being gradually withdrawn, the simultaneous substitution of another anticonvulsant may be indicated\n【88】 - Caution in Renally Impaired Patients\n【89】 - Metabolites of clonazepam are excreted by the kidneys; to avoid their excess accumulation, caution should be exercised in the administration of the drug to patients with impaired renal function\n【90】 - Hypersalivation\n【91】 - Clonazepam may produce an increase in salivation. This should be considered before giving the drug to patients who have difficulty handling secretions. Because of this and the possibility of respiratory depression, clonazepam should be used with caution in patients with chronic respiratory diseases\n【92】 # Adverse Reactions\n【93】 # Clinical Trials Experience\n【94】 - The adverse experiences for clonazepam are provided separately for patients with seizure disorders and with panic disorder\n【95】 - Seizure Disorders\n【96】 - The most frequently occurring side effects of clonazepam are referable to CNS depression. Experience in treatment of seizures has shown that drowsiness has occurred in approximately 50% of patients and ataxia in approximately 30%. In some cases, these may diminish with time; behavior problems have been noted in approximately 25% of patients. Others, listed by system, are:\n【97】 - Neurologic: abnormal eye movements, aphonia, choreiform movements, coma, diplopia, dysarthria, dysdiadochokinesis, “glassy-eyed” appearance, headache, hemiparesis, hypotonia, nystagmus, respiratory depression, slurred speech, tremor, vertigo\n【98】 - Psychiatric: confusion, depression, amnesia, hallucinations, hysteria, increased libido, insomnia, psychosis (the behavior effects are more likely to occur in patients with a history of psychiatric disturbances)\n【99】 - The following paradoxical reactions have been observed: excitability, irritability, aggressive behavior, agitation, nervousness, hostility, anxiety, sleep disturbances, nightmares and vivid dreams\n【100】 - Respiratory: chest congestion, rhinorrhea, shortness of breath, hypersecretion in upper respiratory passages\n【101】 - Cardiovascular: palpitations\n【102】 - Dermatologic: hair loss, hirsutism, skin rash, ankle and facial edema\n【103】 - Gastrointestinal: anorexia, coated tongue, constipation, diarrhea, dry mouth, encopresis, gastritis, increased appetite, nausea, sore gums\n【104】 - Genitourinary: dysuria, enuresis, nocturia, urinary retention\n【105】 - Musculoskeletal: muscle weakness, pains\n【106】 - Miscellaneous: dehydration, general deterioration, fever, lymphadenopathy, weight loss or gain\n【107】 - Hematopoietic: anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, eosinophilia\n【108】 - Hepatic: hepatomegaly, transient elevations of serum transaminases and alkaline phosphatase\n【109】 - Panic disorder\n【110】 - Adverse events during exposure to clonazepam were obtained by spontaneous report and recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Consequently, it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse events without first grouping similar types of events into a smaller number of standardized event categories. In the s and tabulations that follow, CIGY dictionary terminology has been used to classify reported adverse events, except in certain cases in which redundant terms were collapsed into more meaningful terms, as noted below\n【111】 - The stated frequencies of adverse events represent the proportion of individuals who experienced, at least once, a treatment-emergent adverse event of the type listed. An event was considered treatment-emergent if it occurred for the first time or worsened while receiving therapy following baseline evaluation\n【112】 - Adverse Findings Observed in Short-Term, Placebo Controlled Trials\n【113】 - Adverse Events Associated With Discontinuation of Treatment\n【114】 - Overall, the incidence of discontinuation due to adverse events was 17% in clonazepam compared to 9% for placebo in the combined data of two 6- to 9-week trials. The most common events (≥1%) associated with discontinuation and a dropout rate twice or greater for clonazepam than that of placebo included the following:\n【115】 - Adverse Events Occurring at an Incidence of 1% or More Among Clonazepam-Treated Patients:\n【116】 -  enumerates the incidence, rounded to the nearest percent, of treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred during acute therapy of panic disorder from a pool of two 6- to 9-week trials. Events reported in 1% or more of patients treated with clonazepam (doses ranging from 0.5 mg/day to 4 mg/day) and for which the incidence was greater than that in placebo-treated patients are included\n【117】 - The prescriber should be aware that the s in  cannot be used to predict the incidence of side effects in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical trials. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with s obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses and investigators. The cited s, however, do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and non drug factors to the side effect incidence in the population studied\n【118】 - Treatment-Emergent Depressive Symptoms\n【119】 - In the pool of two short-term placebo-controlled trials, adverse events classified under the preferred term “depression” were reported in 7% of clonazepam-treated patients compared to 1% of placebo-treated patients, without any clear pattern of dose relatedness. In these same trials, adverse events classified under the preferred term “depression” were reported as leading to discontinuation in 4% of clonazepam-treated patients compared to 1% of placebo-treated patients. While these findings are noteworthy, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) data collected in these trials revealed a larger decline in HAM-D scores in the clonazepam group than the placebo group suggesting that clonazepam-treated patients were not experiencing a worsening or emergence of clinical depression\n【120】 - Other Adverse Events Observed During the Pre marketing Evaluation of Clonazepam in panic disorder\n【121】 - Following is a list of modified CIGY terms that reflect treatment-emergent adverse events reported by patients treated with clonazepam at multiple doses during clinical trials. All reported events are included except those already listed in  or elsewhere in labeling, those events for which a drug cause was remote, those event terms which were so general as to be uninformative, and events reported only once and which did not have a substantial probability of being acutely life-threatening. It is important to emphasize that, although the events occurred during treatment with clonazepam, they were not necessarily caused by it\n【122】 - Events are further categorized by body system and listed in order of decreasing frequency. These adverse events were reported infrequently, which is defined as occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients\n【123】 - Body as a Whole: weight increase, accident, weight decrease, wound, edema, fever, shivering, abrasions, ankle edema, edema foot, edema periorbital, injury, malaise, pain, cellulitis, inflammation localized\n【124】 - Cardiovascular Disorders: chest pain, hypotension postural\n【125】 - Central and Peripheral Nervous System Disorders: migraine, paresthesia, drunkenness, feeling of enuresis, paresis, tremor, burning skin, falling, head fullness, hoarseness, hyperactivity, hypoesthesia, tongue thick, twitching\n【126】 - Gastrointestinal System Disorders: abdominal discomfort, gastrointestinal inflammation, stomach upset, toothache, flatulence, pyrosis, saliva increased, tooth disorder, bowel movements frequent, pain pelvic, dyspepsia, hemorrhoids\n【127】 - Hearing and Vestibular Disorders: vertigo, otitis, earache, motion sickness\n【128】 - Heart Rate and Rhythm Disorders: palpitation\n【129】 - Metabolic and Nutritional Disorders: thirst, gout\n【130】 - Musculoskeletal System Disorders: back pain, fracture traumatic, sprains and strains, pain leg, pain nape, cramps muscle, cramps leg, pain ankle, pain shoulder, tendinitis, arthralgia, hypertonia, lumbago, pain feet, pain jaw, pain knee, swelling knee\n【131】 - Platelet, Bleeding and Clotting Disorders: bleeding dermal\n【132】 - Psychiatric Disorders: insomnia, organic disinhibition, anxiety, depersonalization, dreaming excessive, libido loss, appetite increased, libido increased, reactions decreased, aggressive reaction, apathy, attention lack, excitement, feeling mad, hunger abnormal, illusion, nightmares, sleep disorders, suicide ideation, yawning\n【133】 - Reproductive Disorders, Female: breast pain, menstrual irregularity\n【134】 - Reproductive Disorders, Male: ejaculation decreased\n【135】 - Resistance Mechanism Disorders: infection mycotic, infection viral, infection streptococcal, herpes simplex infection, infectious mononucleosis, moniliasis\n【136】 - Respiratory System Disorders: sneezing excessive, asthmatic attack, dyspnea, nosebleed, pneumonia, pleurisy\n【137】 - Skin and Appendages Disorders: acne flare, alopecia, xeroderma, dermatitis contact, flushing, pruritus, pustular reaction, skin burns, skin disorder\n【138】 - Special Senses Other, Disorders: taste loss\n【139】 - Urinary System Disorders: dysuria, cystitis, polyuria, urinary incontinence, bladder dysfunction, urinary retention, urinary tract bleeding, urine discoloration\n【140】 - Vascular (Extracardiac) Disorders: thrombophlebitis leg\n【141】 - Vision Disorders: eye irritation, visual disturbance, diplopia, eye twitching, styes, visual field defect, xerophthalmia\n【142】 ## Postmarketing Experience\n【143】 - FDA package insert for clonazepam contains no information regarding post marketing experience\n【144】 # Drug Interactions\n【145】 - There is limited information regarding Clonazepam Drug Interactions in the drug label\n【146】 # Usein Specific Populations\n【147】 ### Pregnancy\n【148】 - Pregnancy Category (FDA): D\n【149】 - To provide information regarding the effects of in utero exposure to clonazepam, physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking clonazepam enroll in the NAAED Pregnancy Registry. This can be done by calling the toll free number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. Information on this registry can also be found at the website /\n【150】 - Pregnancy Category (AUS):\n【151】 - There is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Clonazepam in women who are pregnant\n【152】 ### Labor and Delivery\n【153】 - The effect of clonazepam on labor and delivery in humans has not been specifically studied; however, perinatal complications have been reported in children born to mothers who have been receiving benzodiazepines late in pregnancy, including findings suggestive of either excess benzodiazepine exposure or of withdrawal phenomena\n【154】 ### Nursing Mothers\n【155】 - Mothers receiving clonazepam should not breastfeed their infants\n【156】 ### Pediatric Use\n【157】 - Because of the possibility that adverse effects on physical or mental development could become apparent only after many years, a benefit-risk consideration of the long-term use of clonazepam is important in pediatric patients being treated for seizure disorder\n【158】 - Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients with panic disorder below the age of 18 have not been established\n【159】 ### Geriatic Use\n【160】 - Clinical studies of clonazepam did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy\n【161】 - Because clonazepam undergoes hepatic metabolism, it is possible that liver disease will impair clonazepam elimination. Metabolites of clonazepam are excreted by the kidneys; to avoid their excess accumulation, caution should be exercised in the administration of the drug to patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased hepatic and/or renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to assess hepatic and/or renal function at the time of dose selection\n【162】 - Sedating drugs may cause confusion and over-sedation in the elderly; elderly patients generally should be started on low doses of clonazepam and observed closely\n【163】 ### Gender\n【164】 - There is no FDA guidance on the use of Clonazepam with respect to specific gender populations\n【165】 ### Race\n【166】 - There is no FDA guidance on the use of Clonazepam with respect to specific racial populations\n【167】 ### Renal Impairment\n【168】 - There is no FDA guidance on the use of Clonazepam in patients with renal impairment\n【169】 ### Hepatic Impairment\n【170】 - There is no FDA guidance on the use of Clonazepam in patients with hepatic impairment\n【171】 # Femalesof Reproductive Potentialand Males\n【172】 - There is no FDA guidance on the use of Clonazepam in women of reproductive potentials and males\n【173】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\n【174】 - There is no FDA guidance one the use of Clonazepam in patients who are immunocompromised\n【175】 # Administration and Monitoring\n【176】 ### Administration\n【177】 - Oral\n【178】 ### Monitoring\n【179】 - FDA package insert for clonazepam contains no information regarding drug monitoring\n【180】 # IV Compatibility\n【181】 - There is limited information about the IV compatibility\n【182】 # Overdosage\n【183】 - FDA package insert for clonazepam contains no information regarding Overdose\n【184】 # Pharmacology\n【185】 ## Mechanism of Action\n【186】 - The precise mechanism by which clonazepam exerts its antiseizure and antipanic effects is unknown, although it is believed to be related to its ability to enhance the activity of gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system\n【187】 ## Structure\n【188】 - Clonazepam ts USP, for oral administration, contain 0.5 mg, 1 mg or 2 mg clonazepam. In addition, each t also contains the following inactive ingredients: corn starch, lactose anhydrous, magnesium stearate and microcrystalline cellulose with the following colorants: 0.5 mg - D&C yellow No. 10 aluminum lake; 1 mg - FD&C blue No. 1 aluminum lake\n【189】 - Chemically, clonazepam is 5-(2-chlorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-7-nitro-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one. It is a light yellow crystalline powder. It has a molecular weight of 315.72 and the following structural formula:\n【190】 ## Pharmacodynamics\n【191】 - The precise mechanism by which clonazepam exerts its antiseizure and antipanic effects is unknown, although it is believed to be related to its ability to enhance the activity of gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. Convulsions produced in rodents by pentylenetetrazol or, to a lesser extent, electrical stimulation are antagonized, as are convulsions produced by photic stimulation in susceptible baboons. A taming effect in aggressive primates, muscle weakness and hypnosis are also produced. In humans, clonazepam is capable of suppressing the spike and wave discharge in absence seizures (petit mal) and decreasing the frequency, amplitude, duration and spread of discharge in minor motor seizures\n【192】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n【193】 - Clonazepam is rapidly and completely absorbed after oral administration. The absolute bioavailability of clonazepam is about 90%. Maximum plasma concentrations of clonazepam are reached within 1 to 4 hours after oral administration. Clonazepam is approximately 85% bound to plasma proteins. Clonazepam is highly metabolized, with less than 2% unchanged clonazepam being excreted in the urine. Biotransformation occurs mainly by reduction of the 7-nitro group to the 4-amino derivative. This derivative can be acetylated, hydroxylated and glucuronidated. Cytochrome P-450, including CYP3A, may play an important role in clonazepam reduction and oxidation. The elimination half-life of clonazepam is typically 30 to 40 hours. Clonazepam pharmacokinetics are dose-independent throughout the dosing range. There is no evidence that clonazepam induces its own metabolism or that of other drugs in humans\n【194】 - Pharmacokinetics in Demographic Subpopulations and in Disease States\n【195】 - Controlled studies examining the influence of gender and age on clonazepam pharmacokinetics have not been conducted, nor have the effects of renal or liver disease on clonazepam pharmacokinetics been studied. Because clonazepam undergoes hepatic metabolism, it is possible that liver disease will impair clonazepam elimination. Thus, caution should be exercised when administering clonazepam to these patients\n【196】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\n【197】 - Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\n【198】 - Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with clonazepam\n【199】 - The data currently available are not sufficient to determine the genotoxic potential of clonazepam\n【200】 - In a two-generation fertility study in which clonazepam was given orally to rats at 10 mg/kg/day and 100 mg/kg/day (low dose approximately 5 times and 24 times the maximum recommended human dose of 20 mg/day for seizure disorder and 4 mg/day for panic disorder, respectively, on a mg/m2 basis), there was a decrease in the number of pregnancies and in the number of offspring surviving until weaning\n【201】 # Clinical Studies\n【202】 - FDA package insert for clonazepam contains no information regarding Clinical studies\n【203】 # How Supplied\n【204】 - Clonazepam ts USP for oral administration are available as:\n【205】 0.5 mg: Round, light yellow, biconvex t, debossed “E” over “63” on one side and bisected on the other side and supplied as:\n【206】 - NDC 0185-0063-01 bottles of 100\n【207】 - NDC 0185-0063-05 bottles of 500\n【208】 - NDC 0185-0063-10 bottles of 1000\n【209】 1 mg: Round, light blue, biconvex t, debossed “E” over “64” on one side and bisected on the other side and supplied as:\n【210】 - NDC 0185-0064-01 bottles of 100\n【211】 - NDC 0185-0064-05 bottles of 500\n【212】 - NDC 0185-0064-10 bottles of 1000\n【213】 2 mg: Round, white, biconvex t, debossed “E” over “65” on one side and bisected on the other side and supplied as:\n【214】 - NDC 0185-0065-01 bottles of 100\n【215】 - NDC 0185-0065-05 bottles of 500\n【216】 - NDC 0185-0065-10 bottles of 1000\n【217】 ## Storage\n【218】 - Store at 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F)\n【219】 - Dispense in a tight, light-resistant container as defined in the USP, with a child-resistant closure, as required\n【220】 # Images\n【221】 ## Drug Images\n【222】 # Packageand Label Display Panel\n【223】 # Patient Counseling Information\n【224】 - A clonazepam medication guide must be given to the patient each time clonazepam is dispensed, as required by law\n【225】 - Patients should be instructed to take clonazepam only as prescribed\n【226】 - Physicians are advised to discuss the following issues with patients for whom they prescribe clonazepam\n【227】 # Precautions with Alcohol\n【228】 - Patients should be advised to avoid alcohol while taking clonazepam\n【229】 # Brand Names\n【230】 - Klonopin\n【231】 - Klonopin Wafers\n【232】 # Look-Alike Drug Names\n【233】 - clonazepam - cloBAZam\n【234】 - clonazepam - cloNIDine\n【235】 - clonazepam - cloNIDine hydrochloride\n【236】 - clonazepam - cloZApine\n【237】 - clonazepam - LORazepam\n【238】 - Klonopin - cloNIDine hydrochloride\n【239】 - Klonopin - cloNIDine\n【240】 # Drug Shortage Status", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": "无关文本#220#222#图片内容", "type4": "语义不完整#240#240#缺少描述\n语义重复#0#240#全文存在多处重复", "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-15 17:51:30", "update_time": "2024-04-15 23:03:58"}

Refer to the ribavirin prescribing information for a list of contraindications for ribavirin\n【37】 # Warnings\n【38】 - Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation has been reported in HCV/HBV coinfected patients who were undergoing or had completed treatment with HCV direct acting antivirals, and who were not receiving HBV antiviral therapy. Some cases have resulted in fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death. Cases have been reported in patients who are HBsAg positive and also in patients with serologic evidence of resolved HBV infection (i.e., HBsAg negative and anti-HBc positive). HBV reactivation has also been reported in patients receiving certain immunosuppressants or chemotherapeutic agents; the risk of HBV reactivation associated with treatment with HCV direct-acting antivirals may be increased in these patients\n【39】 - HBV reactivation is characterized as an abrupt increase in HBV replication manifesting as a rapid increase in serum HBV DNA level. In patients with resolved HBV infection, reappearance of HBsAg can occur. Reactivation of HBV replication may be accompanied by hepatitis, i.e., increases in aminotransferase levels and, in severe cases, increases in bilirubin levels, liver failure, and death can occur\n【40】 - Test all patients for evidence of current or prior HBV infection by measuring HBsAg and anti-HBc before initiating HCV treatment with Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir. In patients with serologic evidence of HBV infection, monitor for clinical and laboratory signs of hepatitis flare or HBV reactivation during HCV treatment with Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir and during post-treatment follow-up. Initiate appropriate patient management for HBV infection as clinically indicated\n【41】 - Postmarketing cases of symptomatic bradycardia, as well as fatal cardiac arrest and cases requiring pacemaker intervention, have been reported when amiodarone is coadministered with Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir. Bradycardia has generally occurred within hours to days, but cases have been observed up to 2 weeks after initiating HCV treatment. Patients also taking beta blockers, or those with underlying cardiac comorbidities and/or advanced liver disease, may be at increased risk for symptomatic bradycardia with coadministration of amiodarone. Bradycardia generally resolved after discontinuation of HCV treatment. The mechanism for this effect is unknown\n【42】 - Coadministration of amiodarone with Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir is not recommended. For patients taking amiodarone who have no other alternative, viable treatment options and who will be coadministered Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir:\n【43】 - Counsel patients about the risk of serious symptomatic bradycardia\n【44】 - Cardiac monitoring in an in-patient setting for the first 48 hours of coadministration is recommended, after which outpatient or self-monitoring of the heart rate should occur on a daily basis through at least the first 2 weeks of treatment\n【45】 - Patients who are taking Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir who need to start amiodarone therapy due to no other alternative, viable treatment options should undergo similar cardiac monitoring as outlined above\n【46】 - Due to amiodarone's long half-life, patients discontinuing amiodarone just prior to starting Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir should also undergo similar cardiac monitoring as outlined above\n【47】 - Patients who develop signs or symptoms of bradycardia should seek medical evaluation immediately. Symptoms may include near-fainting or fainting, dizziness or lightheadedness, malaise, weakness, excessive tiredness, shortness of breath, chest pains, confusion or memory problems\n【48】 - The concomitant use of Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir and P-gp inducers (e.g., rifampin, St. John's wort) may significantly decrease Ledipasvir and Sofosbuvir plasma concentrations and may lead to a reduced therapeutic effect of Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir. Therefore, the use of Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir with P-gp inducers (e.g., rifampin or St. John's wort) is not recommended\n【49】 - If Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir is administered with ribavirin, the warnings and precautions for ribavirin, in particular the pregnancy avoidance warning, apply to this combination regimen. Refer to the ribavirin prescribing information for a full list of the warnings and precautions for ribavirin\n【50】 # Adverse Reactions\n【51】 # Clinical Trials Experience\n【52】 - Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice\n【53】 - If Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir is administered with ribavirin to adults,  the prescribing information for ribavirin for a description of ribavirin-associated adverse reactions\n【54】 - Clinical Trials in Adult Subjects\n【55】 - The safety assessment of Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir was based on pooled data from three randomized, open-label Phase 3 clinical trials (ION-3, ION-1, and ION-2) of subjects with genotype 1 HCV with compensated liver disease (with and without cirrhosis) including 215, 539, and 326 subjects who received Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir once daily by mouth for 8, 12 and 24 weeks, respectively\n【56】 - The proportion of subjects who permanently discontinued treatment due to adverse events was 0%, less than 1%, and 1% for subjects receiving Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir for 8, 12, and 24 weeks, respectively\n【57】 - The most common adverse reactions (at least 10%) were fatigue and headache in subjects treated with 8, 12, or 24 weeks of Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir\n【58】 -  lists adverse reactions (adverse events assessed as causally related by the investigator, all grades) observed in at least 5% of subjects receiving 8, 12, or 24 weeks treatment with Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir in clinical trials. The majority of adverse reactions presented in  occurred at severity of grade 1. The side-by-side tabulation is to simplify presentation; direct comparison across trials should not be made due to differing trial designs\n【59】 - The safety assessment of Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir was also based on pooled data from three open-label trials (Study 1119, ION-4, and ELECTRON-2) in 118 subjects with chronic HCV genotype 4, 5, or 6 infection with compensated liver disease (with or without cirrhosis). The subjects received Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir once daily by mouth for 12 weeks. The safety profile in subjects with chronic HCV genotype 4, 5, or 6 infection with compensated liver disease was similar to that observed in subjects with chronic HCV genotype 1 infection with compensated liver disease. The most common adverse reactions occurring in at least 10% of subjects were asthenia (18%), headache (14%), and fatigue (10%)\n【60】 - Adverse Reactions in Subjects with Cirrhosis\n【61】 - The safety assessment of Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir with or without ribavirin was based on a randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled trial in treatment-experienced genotype 1 subjects with compensated cirrhosis and was compared to placebo in the SIRIUS trial. Subjects were randomized to receive 24 weeks of Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir once daily by mouth without ribavirin or 12 weeks of placebo followed by 12 weeks of Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir once daily by mouth + ribavirin.  presents the adverse reactions, as defined above, that occurred with at least 5% greater frequency in subjects treated with 24 weeks of Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir or 12 weeks of Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir + ribavirin, compared to those reported for 12 weeks of placebo. The majority of the adverse reactions presented in  were Grade 1 or 2 in severity\n【62】 - Adverse Reactions in Subjects Coinfected with HIV-1\n【63】 - The safety assessment of Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir was based on an open-label clinical trial in 335 genotype 1 or 4 subjects with HCV/HIV-1 coinfection who were on santiretroviral therapy in Study ION-4. The safety profile in HCV/HIV-1 coinfected subjects was similar to that observed in HCV mono-infected subjects. The most common adverse reactions occurring in at least 10% of subjects were headache (20%) and fatigue (17%)\n【64】 - Adverse Reactions in Liver Transplant Recipients and/or Subjects with Decompensated Cirrhosis\n【65】 - The safety assessment of Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir with ribavirin (RBV) in liver transplant recipients and/or those who had decompensated liver disease was based on pooled data from two Phase 2 open-label clinical trials including 336 subjects who received Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir plus RBV for 12 weeks. Subjects with Child-Pugh-Turcotte (CPT) scores greater than 12 were excluded from the trials\n【66】 - The adverse events observed were consistent with the expected clinical sequelae of liver transplantation and/or decompensated liver disease, or the known safety profile of Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir and/or ribavirin\n【67】 - Decreases in hemoglobin to less than 10 g/dL and 8.5 g/dL during treatment were observed in 38% and 13% of subjects treated with Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir plus RBV for 12 weeks, respectively. Ribavirin was permanently discontinued in 11% of subjects treated with Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir plus RBV for 12 weeks\n【68】 - Liver Transplant Recipients with Compensated Liver Disease:\n【69】 - Among the 174 liver transplant recipients with compensated liver disease who received Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir with RBV for 12 weeks, 2 (1%) subjects permanently discontinued Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir due to an adverse event\n【70】 - Subjects with Decompensated Liver Disease:\n【71】 - Among the 162 subjects with decompensated liver disease (pre- or post-transplant) who received Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir with RBV for 12 weeks, 7 (4%) subjects died, 4 (2%) subjects underwent liver transplantation, and 1 subject (<1%) underwent liver transplantation and died during treatment or within 30 days after discontinuation of treatment. Because these events occurred in patients with advanced liver disease who are at risk of progression of liver disease including liver failure and death, it is not possible to reliably assess the contribution of drug effect to outcomes. A total of 4 (2%) subjects permanently discontinued Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir due to an adverse event\n【72】 - Less Common Adverse Reactions Reported in Clinical Trials (less than 5%): The following adverse reactions occurred in less than 5% of subjects receiving Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir in any one trial. These events have been included because of their seriousness or assessment of potential causal relationship\n【73】 - Psychiatric disorders: depression (including in subjects with pre-existing history of psychiatric illness)\n【74】 - Depression (particularly in subjects with pre-existing history of psychiatric illness) occurred in subjects receiving Sofosbuvir containing regimens. Suicidal ideation and suicide have occurred in less than 1% of subjects treated with Sofosbuvir in combination with ribavirin or pegylated interferon/ribavirin in other clinical trials\n【75】 - Laboratory Abnormalities\n【76】 - Bilirubin Elevations: Bilirubin elevations of greater than 1.5×ULN were observed in 3%, less than 1%, and 2% of subjects treated with Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir for 8, 12, and 24 weeks, respectively. Bilirubin elevations of greater than 1.5×ULN were observed in 3%, 11%, and 3% of subjects with compensated cirrhosis treated with placebo, Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir + ribavirin for 12 weeks and Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir for 24 weeks, respectively, in the SIRIUS trial\n【77】 - Lipase Elevations: Transient, asymptomatic lipase elevations of greater than 3×ULN were observed in less than 1%, 2%, and 3% of subjects treated with Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir for 8, 12, and 24 weeks, respectively. Transient, asymptomatic lipase elevations of greater than 3× ULN were observed in 1%, 3%, and 9% of subjects with compensated cirrhosis treated with placebo, Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir + ribavirin for 12 weeks, and Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir for 24 weeks, respectively, in the SIRIUS trial\n【78】 - Creatine Kinase: Creatine kinase was not assessed in Phase 3 trials ION-3, ION-1, or ION-2 of Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir. Creatine kinase was assessed in the ION-4 trial. Isolated, asymptomatic creatine kinase elevations of greater than or equal to 10×ULN was observed in 1% of subjects treated with Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir for 12 weeks in the ION-4 trial and has also been previously reported in subjects treated with Sofosbuvir in combination with ribavirin or peginterferon/ribavirin in other clinical trials\n【79】 - Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Subjects 12 Years of Age and Older\n【80】 - The safety assessment of Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir in pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older is based on data from a Phase 2, open-label clinical trial (Study 1116) that enrolled 100 subjects without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis who were treated with Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir for 12 weeks. The adverse reactions observed were consistent with those observed in clinical studies of Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir in adults. Limited safety data are available in pediatric subjects receiving Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir for 24 weeks. No Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions or discontinuation due to an adverse reaction was observed in those pediatric subjects receiving Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir for 24 weeks\n【81】 ## Postmarketing Experience\n【82】 - The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir. Because postmarketing reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure\n【83】 - Cardiac Disorders\n【84】 - Serious symptomatic bradycardia has been reported in patients taking amiodarone who initiate treatment with Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir\n【85】 - Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders\n【86】 - Skin rashes, sometimes with blisters or angioedema-like swelling\n【87】 - Angioedema\n【88】 # Drug Interactions\n【89】 - Potential for Drug Interaction\n【90】 - Established and Potentially Significant Drug Interactions\n【91】 - Drugs without Clinically Significant Interactions with Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir\n【92】 - As Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir contains Ledipasvir and Sofosbuvir, any interactions that have been identified with these agents individually may occur with Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir\n【93】 - After oral administration of Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir, Sofosbuvir is rapidly absorbed and subject to extensive first-pass hepatic extraction. In clinical pharmacology studies, both Sofosbuvir and the inactive metabolite GS-331007 were monitored for purposes of pharmacokinetic analyses\n【94】 - Ledipasvir is an inhibitor of the drug transporters P-gp and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) and may increase intestinal absorption of coadministered substrates for these transporters\n【95】 - Ledipasvir and Sofosbuvir are substrates of drug transporters P-gp and BCRP while GS-331007 is not. P-gp inducers (e.g., rifampin or St. John's wort) may decrease Ledipasvir and Sofosbuvir plasma concentrations, leading to reduced therapeutic effect of Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir, and the use with P-gp inducers is not recommended with Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir\n【96】 - Fluctuations in INR values may occur in patients receiving warfarin concomitant with HCV treatment, including treatment with Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir. Frequent monitoring of INR values is recommended during treatment and post-treatment follow-up\n【97】 -  provides a listing of established or potentially clinically significant drug interactions. The drug interactions described are based on studies conducted with either Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir, the components of Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir (Ledipasvir and Sofosbuvir) as individual agents, or are predicted drug interactions that may occur with Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir\n【98】 # Usein Specific Populations\n【99】 ### Pregnancy\n【100】 - Pregnancy Category (FDA):\n【101】 - Risk Summary\n【102】 - If Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir is administered with ribavirin, the combination regimen is contraindicated in pregnant women and in men whose female partners are pregnant. Refer to the ribavirin prescribing information for more information on ribavirin-associated risks of use during pregnancy\n【103】 - No adequate human data are available to establish whether or not Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir poses a risk to pregnancy outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes was observed with the components of Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir (Ledipasvir or Sofosbuvir) at exposures greater than those in humans at the recommended human dose (RHD). During organogenesis in the rat and rabbit, systemic exposures (AUC) to Ledipasvir were approximately 4 (rats) and 2 (rabbits) times the exposure in humans at the RHD, while exposures to the predominant circulating metabolite of Sofosbuvir (GS-331007) were ≥3 (rats) and 7 (rabbits) times the exposure in humans at the RHD. In rat pre/postnatal development studies, maternal systemic exposures (AUC) to Ledipasvir and GS-331007 were approximately 5 and 7 times, respectively, the exposure in humans at the RHD\n【104】 - The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2–4% and 15–20%, respectively\n【105】 - Data (Animal)\n【106】 - Ledipasvir: Ledipasvir was administered orally to pregnant rats (up to 100 mg/kg/day) and rabbits (up to 180 mg/kg/day) on gestation days 6 to 18 and 7 to 20, respectively, and also to rats (oral doses up to 100 mg/kg/day) on gestation day 6 to lactation/post-partum day 20. No significant effects on embryo-fetal (rats and rabbits) or pre/postnatal (rats) development were observed at the highest doses tested. Systemic exposures (AUC) to Ledipasvir were ≥4 (rats) and 2 (rabbits) times the exposure in humans at the RHD\n【107】 - Sofosbuvir: Sofosbuvir was administered orally to pregnant rats (up to 500 mg/kg/day) and rabbits (up to 300 mg/kg/day) on gestation days 6 to 18 and 6 to 19, respectively, and also to rats (oral doses up to 500 mg/kg/day) on gestation day 6 to lactation/post-partum day 20. No significant effects on embryo-fetal (rats and rabbits) or pre/postnatal (rats) development were observed at the highest doses tested. Systemic exposures (AUC) to the predominant circulating metabolite of Sofosbuvir (GS-331007) were ≥3 (rats) and 7 (rabbits) times the exposure in humans at the RHD, with exposures increasing during gestation from approximately 3 to 6 (rats) and 7 to 17 (rabbits) times the exposure in humans at the RHD\n【108】 - Pregnancy Category (AUS):\n【109】 - There is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Ledipasvir / sofosbuvir in women who are pregnant\n【110】 ### Labor and Delivery\n【111】 - There is no FDA guidance on use of Ledipasvir / sofosbuvir during labor and delivery\n【112】 ### Nursing Mothers\n【113】 - Risk Summary\n【114】 - It is not known whether Ledipasvir or Sofosbuvir, the components of Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir, or their metabolites are present in human breast milk, affect human milk production or have effects on the breastfed infant. When administered to lactating rats, Ledipasvir was detected in the plasma of nursing pups likely due to the presence of Ledipasvir in milk, without clear effects on nursing pups. The predominant circulating metabolite of Sofosbuvir (GS-331007) was the primary component observed in the milk of lactating rats, without effect on nursing pups\n【115】 - The development and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir or from the underlying maternal condition\n【116】 - If Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir is administered with ribavirin, the nursing mother's information for ribavirin also applies to this combination regimen. Refer to the ribavirin prescribing information for more information on use during lactation\n【117】 - Data\n【118】 - Ledipasvir: No effects of Ledipasvir on growth and postnatal development were observed in nursing pups at the highest dose tested in rats. Maternal systemic exposure (AUC) to Ledipasvir was approximately 5 times the exposure in humans at the RHD. Although not measured directly, Ledipasvir was likely present in the milk of lactating rats, since systemic exposure (AUC) to Ledipasvir of approximately 25% that of maternal exposure was observed in nursing pups on lactation day 10\n【119】 - Sofosbuvir: No effects of Sofosbuvir on growth and postnatal development were observed in nursing pups at the highest dose tested in rats. Maternal systemic exposure (AUC) to the predominant circulating metabolite of Sofosbuvir (GS-331007) was approximately 7 times the exposure in humans at the RHD, with exposure of approximately 2% that of maternal exposure observed in nursing pups on lactation day 10. In a lactation study, Sofosbuvir metabolites (primarily GS-331007) were excreted into the milk of lactating rats following administration of a single oral dose of Sofosbuvir (20 mg/kg) on lactation day 2, with milk concentrations of approximately 10% that of maternal plasma concentrations observed 1 hour post-dose\n【120】 ### Pediatric Use\n【121】 - The safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir for treatment of HCV genotype 1 infection in treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced pediatric patients 12 years of age and older without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis have been established in an open-label, multicenter clinical trial (Study 1116, N=100; 80 treatment-naïve, 20 treatment-experienced) and are comparable to that observed in adults\n【122】 - The safety and efficacy of Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir for treatment of HCV genotypes 4, 5, or 6 infection in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older or weighing at least 35 kg without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis is supported by comparable Ledipasvir, Sofosbuvir, and GS-331007 exposures between adults and adolescents with HCV genotype 1 and similar efficacy and exposures across HCV genotypes 1, 4, 5, and 6 in adults\n【123】 - The safety and efficacy of Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir have not been established in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age and weighing less than 35 kg, in pediatric patients with decompensated cirrhosis, or in pediatric liver transplant recipients\n【124】 ### Geriatic Use\n【125】 - Clinical trials of Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir included 225 subjects aged 65 and over (9% of total number of subjects in the clinical studies). No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. No dosage adjustment of Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir is warranted in geriatric patients\n【126】 ### Gender\n【127】 - There is no FDA guidance on the use of Ledipasvir / sofosbuvir with respect to specific gender populations\n【128】 ### Race\n【129】 - There is no FDA guidance on the use of Ledipasvir / sofosbuvir with respect to specific racial populations\n【130】 ### Renal Impairment\n【131】 - No dosage adjustment of Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir is required for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. The safety and efficacy of Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir have not been established in patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) or ESRD requiring hemodialysis. No dosage recommendation can be given for patients with severe renal impairment or ESRD. Refer to ribavirin prescribing information regarding use in patients with renal impairment\n【132】 ### Hepatic Impairment\n【133】 - No dosage adjustment of Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir is required for patients with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A, B, or C)\n【134】 - Clinical and hepatic laboratory monitoring, as clinically indicated, is recommended for patients with decompensated cirrhosis receiving treatment with Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir and ribavirin\n【135】 # Femalesof Reproductive Potentialand Males\n【136】 - If Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir is administered with ribavirin, the information for ribavirin with regard to pregnancy testing, contraception, and infertility also applies to this combination regimen. Refer to ribavirin prescribing information for additional information\n【137】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\n【138】 - There is no FDA guidance one the use of Ledipasvir / sofosbuvir in patients who are immunocompromised\n【139】 # Administration and Monitoring\n【140】 ### Administration\n【141】 - Give with or without food\n【142】 - Separate administration of antacids and Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir by 4 hours\n【143】 ### Monitoring\n【144】 - Hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype: Prior to initiation of therapy\n【145】 - A reduction from baseline in HCV-RNA viral load may indicate efficacy\n【146】 - Hepatitis B virus (HBV) current or prior infection: Prior to initiation\n【147】 - Clinical and laboratory signs of hepatitis flare or HBV reactivation, in patients with evidence of current or prior HBV infection: During treatment and post-treatment follow-up\n【148】 - Hepatic function, as appropriate in patients with decompensated cirrhosis who are coadministered ribavirin\n【149】 # IV Compatibility\n【150】 - There is limited information regarding the compatibility of Ledipasvir / sofosbuvir and IV administrations\n【151】 # Overdosage\n【152】 - No specific antidote is available for overdose with Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir. If overdose occurs, the patient must be monitored for evidence of toxicity. Treatment of overdose with Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir consists of general supportive measures including monitoring of vital signs as well as observation of the clinical status of the patient. Hemodialysis is unlikely to result in significant removal of Ledipasvir since Ledipasvir is highly bound to plasma protein. Hemodialysis can efficiently remove the predominant circulating metabolite of Sofosbuvir, GS-331007, with an extraction ratio of 53%\n【153】 # Pharmacology\n【154】 ## Mechanism of Action\n【155】 - Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir is a fixed-dose combination of Ledipasvir and Sofosbuvir which are direct-acting antiviral agents against the hepatitis C virus\n【156】 ## Structure\n【157】 - Ledipasvir\n【158】 - Sofosbuvir\n【159】 ## Pharmacodynamics\n【160】 - Cardiac Electrophysiology\n【161】 - Thorough QT studies have been conducted for Ledipasvir and Sofosbuvir\n【162】 - The effect of Ledipasvir 120 mg twice daily (2.67 times the maximum recommended dosage) for 10 days on QTc interval was evaluated in a randomized, multiple-dose, placebo-, and active-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg) three period crossover thorough QT trial in 59 healthy subjects. At the dose of 120 mg twice daily (2.67 times the maximum recommended dosage), Ledipasvir does not prolong QTc interval to any clinically relevant extent\n【163】 - The effect of Sofosbuvir 400 mg (maximum recommended dosage) and 1200 mg (three times the maximum recommended dosage) on QTc interval was evaluated in a randomized, single-dose, placebo-, and active-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg) four period crossover thorough QT trial in 59 healthy subjects. At a dose three times the maximum recommended dose, Sofosbuvir does not prolong QTc to any clinically relevant extent\n【164】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n【165】 - Absorption\n【166】 - The pharmacokinetic properties of Ledipasvir, Sofosbuvir, and the predominant circulating metabolite GS-331007 have been evaluated in healthy adult subjects and in subjects with chronic hepatitis C. Following oral administration of Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir, Ledipasvir median peak concentrations were observed 4 to 4.5 hours post-dose. Sofosbuvir was absorbed quickly and the peak median plasma concentration was observed ~0.8 to 1 hour post-dose. Median peak plasma concentration of GS-331007 was observed between 3.5 to 4 hours post-dose\n【167】 - Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis in HCV-infected subjects, geometric mean steady-state AUC0–24 for Ledipasvir (N=2113), Sofosbuvir (N=1542), and GS-331007 (N=2113) were 7290, 1320, and 12,000 ng∙hr/mL, respectively. Steady-state Cmax for Ledipasvir, Sofosbuvir, and GS-331007 were 323, 618, and 707 ng/mL, respectively. Sofosbuvir and GS-331007 AUC0–24 and Cmax were similar in healthy adult subjects and subjects with HCV infection. Relative to healthy subjects (N=191), Ledipasvir AUC0–24 and Cmax were 24% lower and 32% lower, respectively, in HCV-infected subjects\n【168】 - Effect of Food\n【169】 - Relative to fasting conditions, the administration of a single dose of Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir with a moderate fat (~600 kcal, 25% to 30% fat) or high fat (~1000 kcal, 50% fat) meal increased Sofosbuvir AUC0–inf by approximately 2-fold, but did not significantly affect Sofosbuvir Cmax. The exposures of GS-331007 and Ledipasvir were not altered in the presence of either meal type. The response rates in Phase 3 trials were similar in HCV-infected subjects who received Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir with food or without food. Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir can be administered without regard to food\n【170】 - Distribution\n【171】 - Ledipasvir is greater than 99.8% bound to human plasma proteins. After a single 90 mg dose of -Ledipasvir in healthy subjects, the blood to plasma ratio of 14C-radioactivity ranged between 0.51 and 0.66\n【172】 - Sofosbuvir is approximately 61–65% bound to human plasma proteins and the binding is independent of drug concentration over the range of 1 microgram/mL to 20 microgram/mL. Protein binding of GS-331007 was minimal in human plasma. After a single 400 mg dose of -Sofosbuvir in healthy subjects, the blood to plasma ratio of 14C-radioactivity was approximately 0.7\n【173】 - Metabolism\n【174】 - In vitro, no detecmetabolism of Ledipasvir was observed by human CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. Evidence of slow oxidative metabolism via an unknown mechanism has been observed. Following a single dose of 90 mg -Ledipasvir, systemic exposure was almost exclusively to the parent drug (greater than 98%). Unchanged Ledipasvir is the major species present in feces\n【175】 - Sofosbuvir is extensively metabolized in the liver to form the pharmacologically active nucleoside analog triphosphate GS-461203. The metabolic activation pathway involves sequential hydrolysis of the carboxyl ester moiety catalyzed by human cathepsin A (CatA) or carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) and phosphoramidate cleavage by histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 1 (HINT1) followed by phosphorylation by the pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis pathway. Dephosphorylation results in the formation of nucleoside metabolite GS-331007 that cannot be efficiently rephosphorylated and lacks anti-HCV activity in vitro. After a single 400 mg oral dose of -Sofosbuvir, GS-331007 accounted for approximately greater than 90% of total systemic exposure\n【176】 - Elimination\n【177】 - Following a single 90 mg oral dose of -Ledipasvir, mean total recovery of the -radioactivity in feces and urine was approximately 87%, with most of the radioactive dose recovered from feces (approximately 86%). Unchanged Ledipasvir excreted in feces accounted for a mean of 70% of the administered dose and the oxidative metabolite M19 accounted for 2.2% of the dose. These data indicate that biliary excretion of unchanged Ledipasvir is a major route of elimination, with renal excretion being a minor pathway (approximately 1%). The median terminal half-life of Ledipasvir following administration of Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir was 47 hours\n【178】 - Following a single 400 mg oral dose of -Sofosbuvir, mean total recovery of the dose was greater than 92%, consisting of approximately 80%, 14%, and 2.5% recovered in urine, feces, and expired air, respectively. The majority of the Sofosbuvir dose recovered in urine was GS-331007 (78%) while 3.5% was recovered as Sofosbuvir. These data indicate that renal clearance is the major elimination pathway for GS-331007. The median terminal half-lives of Sofosbuvir and GS-331007 following administration of Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir were 0.5 and 27 hours, respectively\n【179】 - Specific Populations\n【180】 - Race: Population pharmacokinetics analysis in HCV-infected subjects indicated that race had no clinically relevant effect on the exposure of Ledipasvir, Sofosbuvir, and GS-331007\n【181】 - Gender: Population pharmacokinetics analysis in HCV-infected subjects indicated that gender had no clinically relevant effect on the exposure of Sofosbuvir and GS-331007. AUC and Cmax of Ledipasvir were 77% and 58% higher, respectively, in females than males; however, the relationship between gender and Ledipasvir exposures was not considered clinically relevant, as high response rates (SVR12 >90%) were achieved in male and female subjects across the Phase 3 studies and the safety profiles are similar in females and males\n【182】 - Pediatric Patients: The pharmacokinetics of Ledipasvir, Sofosbuvir, and GS-331007 were determined in 100 pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older infected with HCV genotype 1 receiving a daily dose of Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir (90 mg Ledipasvir and 400 mg Sofosbuvir). The pharmacokinetic properties of Ledipasvir, Sofosbuvir, and GS-331007 in pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older are provided in  Exposures in pediatric subjects were similar to those observed in adults\n【183】 - The pharmacokinetics of Ledipasvir or Sofosbuvir have not been established in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age\n【184】 - Geriatric Patients: Population pharmacokinetic analysis in HCV-infected subjects showed that within the age range (18 to 80 years) analyzed, age did not have a clinically relevant effect on the exposure to Ledipasvir, Sofosbuvir, and GS-331007\n【185】 - Patients with Renal Impairment: The pharmacokinetics of Ledipasvir were studied with a single dose of 90 mg Ledipasvir in HCV negative subjects with severe renal impairment (eGFR less than 30 mL/min by Cockcroft-Gault). No clinically relevant differences in Ledipasvir pharmacokinetics were observed between healthy subjects and subjects with severe renal impairment\n【186】 - The pharmacokinetics of Sofosbuvir were studied in HCV negative subjects with mild (eGFR between 50 to less than 80 mL/min/1.73 m2), moderate (eGFR between 30 to less than 50 mL/min/1.73 m2), severe renal impairment (eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2), and subjects with ESRD requiring hemodialysis following a single 400 mg dose of sofosbuvir. Relative to subjects with normal renal function (eGFR greater than 80 mL/min/1.73 m2), the Sofosbuvir AUC0–inf was 61%, 107%, and 171% higher in mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, while the GS-331007 AUC0–inf was 55%, 88%, and 451% higher, respectively. In subjects with ESRD, relative to subjects with normal renal function, Sofosbuvir and GS-331007 AUC0–inf was 28% and 1280% higher when Sofosbuvir was dosed 1 hour before hemodialysis compared with 60% and 2070% higher when Sofosbuvir was dosed 1 hour after hemodialysis, respectively. A 4 hour hemodialysis session removed approximately 18% of administered dose\n【187】 - Patients with Hepatic Impairment: The pharmacokinetics of Ledipasvir were studied with a single dose of 90 mg Ledipasvir in HCV negative subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). Ledipasvir plasma exposure (AUC0–inf) was similar in subjects with severe hepatic impairment and control subjects with normal hepatic function. Population pharmacokinetics analysis in HCV-infected subjects indicated that cirrhosis (including decompensated cirrhosis) had no clinically relevant effect on the exposure of Ledipasvir\n【188】 - The pharmacokinetics of Sofosbuvir were studied following 7-day dosing of 400 mg Sofosbuvir in HCV-infected subjects with moderate and severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B and C). Relative to subjects with normal hepatic function, the Sofosbuvir AUC0–24 were 126% and 143% higher in moderate and severe hepatic impairment, while the GS-331007 AUC0–24 were 18% and 9% higher, respectively. Population pharmacokinetics analysis in HCV-infected subjects indicated that cirrhosis (including decompensated cirrhosis) had no clinically relevant effect on the exposure of Sofosbuvir and GS-331007\n【189】 - Drug Interaction Studies\n【190】 - Ledipasvir and Sofosbuvir are substrates of drug transporters P-gp and BCRP while GS-331007 is not. P-gp inducers (e.g., rifampin or St. John's wort) may decrease Ledipasvir and Sofosbuvir plasma concentrations, leading to reduced therapeutic effect of Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir, and the use with P-gp inducers is not recommended with Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir. Coadministration with drugs that inhibit P-gp and/or BCRP may increase Ledipasvir and Sofosbuvir plasma concentrations without increasing GS-331007 plasma concentration; Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir may be coadministered with P-gp and/or BCRP inhibitors. Neither Ledipasvir nor Sofosbuvir is a substrate for hepatic uptake transporters OCT1, OATP1B1, or OATP1B3. GS-331007 is not a substrate for renal transporters, including organic anion transporter OAT1 or OAT3, or organic cation transporter OCT2\n【191】 - Ledipasvir is subject to slow oxidative metabolism via an unknown mechanism. In vitro, no detecmetabolism of Ledipasvir by CYP enzymes has been observed. Biliary excretion of unchanged Ledipasvir is a major route of elimination. Sofosbuvir is not a substrate for CYP and UGT1A1 enzymes. Clinically significant drug interactions with Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir mediated by CYP or UGT1A1 enzymes are not expected\n【192】 - The effects of coadministered drugs on the exposure of Ledipasvir, Sofosbuvir, and GS-331007 are shown in\n【193】 - No effect on the pharmacokinetic parameters of Ledipasvir, Sofosbuvir, and GS-331007 was observed with raltegravir and the combination of abacavir and lamivudine; emtricitabine, rilpivirine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate; or dolutegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate\n【194】 - Ledipasvir is an inhibitor of drug transporter P-gp and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) and may increase intestinal absorption of coadministered substrates for these transporters. Ledipasvir is an inhibitor of transporters OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and BSEP only at concentrations exceeding those achieved in clinic. Ledipasvir is not an inhibitor of transporters MRP2, MRP4, OCT2, OAT1, OAT3, MATE1, and OCT1. The drug-drug interaction potential of Ledipasvir is primarily limited to the intestinal inhibition of P-gp and BCRP. Clinically relevant transporter inhibition by Ledipasvir in the systemic circulation is not expected due to its high protein binding. Sofosbuvir and GS-331007 are not inhibitors of drug transporters P-gp, BCRP, MRP2, BSEP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and OCT1, and GS-331007 is not an inhibitor of OAT1, OCT2, and MATE1\n【195】 - Ledipasvir, Sofosbuvir, and GS-331007 are not inhibitors or inducers of CYP or UGT1A1 enzymes\n【196】 - The effects of Ledipasvir or Sofosbuvir on the exposure of coadministered drugs are shown in\n【197】 - No effect on the pharmacokinetic parameters of the following coadministered drugs was observed with Ledipasvir or Sofosbuvir: abacavir, cyclosporine, darunavir/ritonavir, dolutegravir, efavirenz, emtricitabine, lamivudine, methadone, or rilpivirine\n【198】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\n【199】 - Carcinogenesis and Mutagenesis\n【200】 - Ledipasvir: Ledipasvir was not genotoxic in a battery of in vitro or in vivo assays, including bacterial mutagenicity, chromosome aberration using human peripheral blood lymphocytes, and in vivo rat micronucleus assays\n【201】 - Ledipasvir was not carcinogenic in a 6-month rasH2 transgenic mouse study (up to 300 mg/kg/day). Similarly, Ledipasvir was not carcinogenic in a 2-year rat study (up to 100 mg/kg/day in males and 30 mg/kg/day in females), resulting in exposures approximately 10 and 4 times, respectively, higher than the exposure in humans at the recommended human dose (RHD)\n【202】 - Sofosbuvir: Sofosbuvir was not genotoxic in a battery of in vitro or in vivo assays, including bacterial mutagenicity, chromosome aberration using human peripheral blood lymphocytes, and in vivo mouse micronucleus assays\n【203】 - Sofosbuvir was not carcinogenic in a 2-year mouse study (up to 200 mg/kg/day in males and 600 mg/kg/day in females) and in a 2-year rat study (up to 750 mg/kg/day), resulting in exposures of the predominant circulating metabolite GS-331007 of approximately 4 and 18 times (in mice) and 8 and 10 times (in rats), in males and females respectively, the exposure in humans at the RHD\n【204】 - Impairment of Fertility\n【205】 - Ledipasvir: Ledipasvir had no adverse effects on mating and fertility. In female rats, the mean number of corpora lutea and implantation sites were reduced slightly at maternal exposures approximately 3 times the exposure in humans at the RHD. At the highest dose levels without effects, exposures of Ledipasvir were approximately 5 and 2 times, in males and females, respectively, the exposure in humans at the RHD\n【206】 - Sofosbuvir: Sofosbuvir had no effects on embryo-fetal viability or on fertility when evaluated in rats. At the highest dose tested, exposure to the predominant circulating metabolite GS-331007 was approximately 5 times the exposure in humans at the RHD\n【207】 # Clinical Studies\n【208】 - The efficacy and safety of Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir were evaluated in four trials in genotype 1 HCV mono-infected subjects including one trial exclusively in treatment-experienced subjects with compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A), one trial in genotype 1 or 4 HCV/HIV-1 coinfected subjects, two trials in genotype 4, 5, or 6 HCV mono-infected subjects, two trials in genotype 1 or 4 HCV infected pretransplant subjects with decompensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh B and C) or post-transplant with Metavir F0–F3 fibrosis, compensated cirrhosis, decompensated cirrhosis, or fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis (FCH), and one trial in genotype 1 HCV pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis, as summarized in\n【209】 - Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir was administered once daily by mouth in these trials. For subjects without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis who received ribavirin (RBV), the RBV dosage was 1000 mg per day for subjects weighing less than 75 kg or 1200 mg per day for subjects weighing at least 75 kg. For subjects with decompensated cirrhosis in SOLAR-1 and SOLAR-2 studies, the starting RBV dosage was 600 mg per day regardless of transplantation status. RBV dose adjustments were performed according to the RBV labeling\n【210】 - Serum HCV RNA values were measured during the clinical trials using the COBAS TaqMan HCV test (version 2.0), for use with the High Pure System in ION-3, ION-1, ION-2, SIRIUS, and ION-4 studies or the COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS Taqman HCV test (version 2.0) in ELECTRON-2, 1119, SOLAR-1, SOLAR-2, and 1116 studies. The COBAS TaqMan HCV test (version 2.0) for use with the High Pure System has a lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of 25 IU per mL and the COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS Taqman HCV test (version 2.0) has a LLOQ of 15 IU per mL. Sustained virologic response (SVR12), defined as HCV RNA less than LLOQ at 12 weeks after the cessation of treatment, was the primary endpoint in studies in adults and the key efficacy endpoint in the study in pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older. Relapse was a secondary endpoint, which was defined as HCV RNA greater than or equal to LLOQ with 2 consecutive values or last available post-treatment measurement during the post-treatment period after achieving HCV RNA less than LLOQ at end of treatment\n【211】 - Treatment-Naïve Adults without Cirrhosis ─ ION-3 (Study 0108)\n【212】 - ION-3 was a randomized, open-label trial in treatment-naïve non-cirrhotic subjects with genotype 1 HCV.

ION-4 enrolled 4 treatment-naïve and 4 previously-treated subjects with genotype 4 HCV infection who were coinfected with HIV-1, none of whom had cirrhosis\n【235】 - In Study 1119, the overall SVR12 rate was 93% (41/44). SVR12 was similar based upon prior HCV treatment history and cirrhosis status. In ION-4, all 8 subjects achieved SVR12\n【236】 - Genotype 5\n【237】 - In the open-label 1119 trial, Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir was administered for 12 weeks to 41 treatment-naïve or previously-treated adult subjects with genotype 5 HCV infection, with or without cirrhosis. The overall SVR12 was 93% (38/41). SVR12 was similar based upon prior HCV treatment history and cirrhosis status\n【238】 - Genotype 6\n【239】 - In the open-label ELECTRON-2 trial, Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir was administered for 12 weeks to 25 treatment-naïve or previously-treated adult subjects with genotype 6 HCV infection, with or without cirrhosis. The overall SVR12 was 96% (24/25). SVR12 was similar based upon prior HCV treatment history and cirrhosis status. The single subject who relapsed discontinued study treatment early (at approximately Week 8)\n【240】 - ION-4 was an open-label clinical trial that evaluated the safety and efficacy of 12 weeks of treatment with Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir without ribavirin in HCV treatment-naïve and previously-treated adult subjects with genotype 1 or 4 HCV infection who were coinfected with HIV-1. Treatment-experienced subjects had failed prior treatment with Peg-IFN + RBV, Peg-IFN + RBV + an HCV protease inhibitor or Sofosbuvir + RBV. Subjects were on a sHIV-1 antiretroviral therapy that included emtricitabine + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, administered with efavirenz, rilpivirine, or raltegravir\n【241】 - Of the 335 treated subjects, the median age was 52 years (range: 26 to 72); 82% of the subjects were male; 61% were White; 34% were Black; mean body mass index was 27 kg/m2 (range: 18 to 66 kg/m2); 75% had genotype 1a HCV infection; 2% had genotype 4 infection; 76% had non-C/C IL28B alleles (CT or TT); and 20% had compensated cirrhosis. Fifty-five percent (55%) of the subjects were treatment-experienced\n【242】 -  presents the SVR12 in the ION-4 trial after 12 weeks of Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir treatment\n【243】 - SVR12 rates were 94% (63/67) in subjects with cirrhosis and 98% (46/47) in subjects who were previously-treated and had cirrhosis. The relapse rate in the ION-4 trial in Black subjects was 9% (10/115), all of whom were IL28B non-CC genotype, and none in non-Black subjects (0/220). In the ION-1, ION-2, and ION-3 HCV mono-infection studies, relapse rates were 3% (10/305) in Black subjects and 2% (26/1637) in non-Black subjects\n【244】 - No subject had HIV-1 rebound during the study. The percentage of CD4+ cells did not change during treatment. Median CD4+ cell count increase of 29 cells/mm3 was observed at the end of treatment with Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir for 12 weeks\n【245】 - SOLAR-1 and SOLAR-2 were two open-label trials that evaluated 12 and 24 weeks of treatment with Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir in combination with ribavirin in HCV treatment-naïve and previously-treated adult subjects with genotype 1 and 4 infection who had undergone liver transplantation and/or who had decompensated liver disease. The two trials were identical in study design. Subjects were enrolled in one of the seven groups in the trials based on liver transplantation status and severity of hepatic impairment . Subjects with a CPT score greater than 12 were excluded. Within each group, subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir + RBV for 12 weeks or Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir + RBV for 24 weeks. For subjects with decompensated cirrhosis in SOLAR-1 and SOLAR-2 studies, the starting RBV dosage was 600 mg per day regardless of transplantation status. RBV dose adjustments were performed according to the RBV labeling\n【246】 - Demographics and baseline characteristics were balanced across the treatment groups. Of the 670 treated subjects, the median age was 59 years (range: 21 to 81); 77% of the subjects were male; 91% were White; mean body mass index was 28 kg/m2 (range: 18 to 49 kg/m2); 94% and 6% had genotype 1 and 4 HCV infection, respectively; 78% of the subjects failed a prior HCV therapy\n【247】 -  presents the pooled SVR12 rates for SOLAR-1 and SOLAR-2 in subjects with genotype 1 HCV treated with Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir + RBV for 12 weeks. The SVR12 rates observed with 24 weeks of Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir + RBV were similar to the SVR12 rates observed with 12 weeks of treatment. Therefore, the results for the Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir + RBV 24 weeks arm are not presented in\n【248】 - There were 7 subjects with fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis in the 12 week treatment arm, and all subjects achieved SVR12\n【249】 - In genotype 4 HCV post-transplant subjects without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis treated with Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir + RBV for 12 weeks (N=12), the SVR12 rate was similar to rates reported with genotype 1; no subjects relapsed. Available data in subjects with genotype 4 HCV who had decompensated cirrhosis (pre- and post-liver transplantation) were insufficient for dosing recommendations; therefore, these results are not presented\n【250】 - The efficacy of Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir was evaluated in an open-label trial (Study 1116) that evaluated 12 weeks of treatment with Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir once daily in genotype 1 HCV treatment-naïve (N=80) and treatment-experienced (N=20) pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis\n【251】 - Demographics and baseline characteristics were balanced across treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced subjects (patients had failed an interferon based regimen with or without ribavirin). Of the 100 treated subjects, the median age was 15 years (range: 12 to 17); 63% of the subjects were female; 90% were White, 7% were Black, and 2% were Asian; 13% were Hispanic/Latino; mean body mass index was 23 kg/m2 (range: 13.1 to 36.6 kg/m2); mean weight was 61 kg (range 33 to 126 kg); 55% had baseline HCV RNA levels greater than or equal to 800,000 IU/mL; 81% had genotype 1a HCV infection; 76% had non-CC IL28B alleles (CT or TT). One subject had known compensated cirrhosis. The majority of subjects (84%) had been infected through vertical transmission\n【252】 - The SVR12 rate was 98% overall (98%  in treatment-naïve subjects and 100%  in treatment-experienced subjects). No subject experienced on-treatment virologic failure or relapse. Two subjects were lost to follow-up\n【253】 # How Supplied\n【254】 - Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir ts are orange, diamond-shaped, film-coated, debossed with \"GSI\" on one side and \"7985\" on the other side of the t.

For example, severe respiratory reactions and cardiac reactions, including death due to bronchospasm in patients with asthma, and rarely, death in association with cardiac failure, have been reported following topical application of beta-adrenergic blocking agents\n【3】 - Since metipranolol ophthalmic solution had a minor effect on heart rate and blood pressure in clinical studies, caution should be observed in treating patients with a history of cardiac failure. Treatment with metipranolol ophthalmic solution should be discontinued at the first evidence of cardiac failure\n【4】 - Metipranolol ophthalmic solution, or other beta-blockers, should not, in general, be administered to patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (e.g., chronic bronchitis, emphysema) of mild or moderate severity . However, if the drug is necessary in such patients, then it should be administered with caution since it may block bronchodilation produced by endogenous and exogenous catecholamine stimulation of beta2 receptors\n【5】 # Precautions\n【6】 ### General\n【7】 - Because of potential effects of beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents relative to blood pressure and pulse, these agents should be used with caution in patients with cerebrovascular insufficiency.

It has been identified as a protein misfolding disease due to the accumulation of abnormally folded amyloid beta protein in the brains of AD patients. Amyloid beta, also written Aβ, is a short peptide that is an abnormal proteolytic byproduct of the transmembrane protein amyloid precursor protein (APP), whose function is unclear but thought to be involved in neuronal development.  The presenilins are components of proteolytic complex involved in APP processing and degradation\n【3】 - Amyloid beta monomers are soluble and contain short regions of beta sheet and polyproline II helix secondary structures in solution, though they are largely alpha helical in membranes; however, at sufficiently high concentration, they undergo a dramatic conformational change to form a beta sheet-rich tertiary structure that aggregates to form amyloid fibrils. These fibrils deposit outside neurons in dense formations known as senile plaques or neuritic plaques, in less dense aggregates as diffuse plaques, and sometimes in the walls of small blood vessels in the brain in a process called amyloid angiopathy or congophilic angiopathy. AD is also considered a tauopathy due to abnormal aggregation of the tau protein, a microtubule-associated protein expressed in neurons that normally acts to stabilize microtubules in the cell cytoskeleton. Like most microtubule-associated proteins, tau is normally regulated by phosphorylation; however, in AD patients, hyperphosphorylated tau accumulates as paired helical filaments that in turn aggregate into masses inside nerve cell bodies known as neurofibrillary tangles and as dystrophic neurites associated with amyloid plaques. Although little is known about the process of filament assembly, it has recently been shown that a depletion of a prolyl isomerase protein in the parvulin family accelerates the accumulation of abnormal tau\n【4】 # Neuropathology\n【5】 - Both amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are clearly visible by microscopy in AD brains. At an anatomical level, AD is characterized by gross diffuse atrophy of the brain and loss of neurons, neuronal processes and synapses in the cerebral cortex and certain subcortical regions. This results in gross atrophy of the affected regions, including degeneration in the temporal lobe and parietal lobe, and parts of the frontal cortex and cingulate gyrus. Levels of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine are reduced. Levels  of the neurotransmitters serotonin, norepinephrine, and somatostatin are also often reduced. Glutamate levels are usually elevated\n【6】 # Disease Mechanism\n【7】 - Although the gross histological features of AD in the brain are well characterized, three major hypotheses have been advanced regarding the primary cause. The oldest hypothesis suggests that deficiency in cholinergic signaling initiates the progression of the disease. Two alternative misfolding hypotheses instead suggest that either tau protein or amyloid beta initiates the cascade. While researchers have not identified a clear causative pathway originating from any of the three molecular hypotheses to explain the gross anatomical changes observed in advanced AD, variants of the amyloid beta hypothesis of molecular initiation have become dominant among the three possibilities\n【8】 ## Cholinergic Hypothesis\n【9】 - The oldest hypothesis is the \"cholinergic hypothesis\". It states that Alzheimer's begins as a deficiency in the production of acetylcholine, a vital neurotransmitter. Much early therapeutic research was based on this hypothesis, including restoration of the \"cholinergic nuclei\". The possibility of cell-replacement therapy was investigated on the basis of this hypothesis. All of the first-generation anti-Alzheimer's medications are based on this hypothesis and work to preserve acetylcholine by inhibiting acetylcholinesterases (enzymes that break down acetylcholine). These medications, though sometimes beneficial, have not led to a cure. In all cases, they have served to only treat symptoms of the disease and have neither halted nor reversed it. These results and other research have led to the conclusion that acetylcholine deficiencies may not be directly causal, but are a result of widespread brain tissue damage, damage so widespread that cell-replacement therapies are likely to be impractical. More recently, cholinergic effects have been proposed as a potential causative agent for the formation of plaques and tangles leading to generalized neuroinflammation\n【10】 - More recent hypotheses center on the effects of the misfolded and aggregated proteins, amyloid beta and tau. The two positions are lightheartedly described as \"ba-ptist\" and \"tau-ist\" viewpoints in scientific publications by Alzheimer's disease researchers.  \"Tau-ists\" believe that the tau protein abnormalities initiate the disease cascade, while \"ba-ptists\" believe that beta amyloid deposits are the causative factor in the disease\n【11】 ## Tau Hypothesis\n【12】 - The hypothesis that tau is the primary causative factor has long been grounded in the observation that deposition of amyloid plaques does not correlate well with neuron loss. A mechanism for neurotoxicity has been proposed based on the loss of microtubule-stabilizing tau protein that leads to the degradation of the cytoskeleton. However, consensus has not been reached on whether tau hyperphosphorylation precedes or is caused by the formation of the abnormal helical filament aggregates. Support for the tau hypothesis also derives from the existence of other diseases known as tauopathies in which the same protein is identifiably misfolded. However, a majority of researchers support the alternative hypothesis that amyloid is the primary causative agent\n【13】 ## Amyloid Hypothesis\n【14】 - The amyloid hypothesis is initially compelling because the gene for the amyloid beta precursor APP is located on chromosome 21, and patients with trisomy 21 - better known as Down syndrome - who thus have an extra gene copy almost universally exhibit AD-like disorders by 40 years of age. The traditional formulation of the amyloid hypothesis points to the cytotoxicity of mature aggregated amyloid fibrils, which are believed to be the toxic form of the protein responsible for disrupting the cell's calcium ion homeostasis and thus inducing apoptosis. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that higher levels of a variant of the beta amyloid protein known to form fibrils faster in vitro correlate with earlier onset and greater cognitive impairment in mouse models. and with AD diagnosis in humans. However, mechanisms for the induced calcium influx, or proposals for alternative cytotoxic mechanisms, by mature fibrils are not obvious\n【15】 - A more recent and broadly supported variation of the amyloid hypothesis identifies the cytotoxic species as an intermediate misfolded form of amyloid beta, neither a soluble monomer nor a mature aggregated polymer but an oligomeric species, possibly toroidal or star-shaped with a central channel that may induce apoptosis by physically piercing the cell membrane. A related alternative suggests that a globular oligomer localized to dendritic processes and axons in neurons is the cytotoxic species\n【16】 - Relevantly, the cytotoxic-fibril hypothesis presented a clear target for drug development: inhibit the fibrillization process. Much early development work on lead compounds has focused on this inhibition; most are also reported to reduce neurotoxicity, but the toxic-oligomer theory would imply that prevention of oligomeric assembly is the more important process or that a better target lies upstream, for example in the inhibition of APP processing to amyloid beta\n【17】 # Related Chapters\n【18】 - Alzheimer's disease", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-15 17:51:30", "update_time": "2024-04-15 22:12:35"}

This structure is a superficial bursa with a thin synovial lining located between the skin and the patella. The bursa develops within the first years of life as a result of mechanical pressure and friction, and it serves the purpose of reducing friction on underlying structures and allowing maximal range of motion in the knee\n【6】 - Aseptic prepatellar bursitis is commonly caused by repetitive work in a kneeling position, hence the name \"housemaid's knee\"\n【7】 - Inflammation of the prepatellar bursa may be aseptic (most common) or septic (e.g. bacterial infection), the septic variants being most common in children and immunocompromised individuals\n【8】 - Prepatellar bursitis is more common in men than women\n【9】 # Physical Examination\n【10】 - Prepatellar Bursitis: Redness and swelling of left prepatellar bursa caused  by bacterial infection\n【11】 - Prepatellar Bursitis: Redness and swelling of prepatellar bursa caused by bacterial infection.

When a person is stung by a bee or wasp they typically have an intense, burning pain followed by erythema (redness) and oedema (swelling) at the site of the sting. This usually subsides within a few hours. After an initial sting, some people have an immune response and produce IgE antibodies. In these people, subsequent stings can trigger a rapid inflammatory response referred to as a 'type I' hypersensitivity reaction\n【8】 - Hypersensitivity reactions to bee or wasp venom can be local or systemic, can vary in severity, and are typically of rapid onset. Large local reactions are characterised by oedema, erythema and pruritus, cover more than 10 cm in diameter and peak at between 24 and 48 hours after the sting. Systemic reactions can be measured using the Mueller grading system. Severity ranges from grade I to grade IV. A grade I systemic reaction is characterised by generalised urticaria or erythema, itching, malaise or anxiety. Grade II reactions may include symptoms associated with grade I reactions as well as generalised oedema, tightness in the chest, wheezing, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, and dizziness. Grade III reactions may include symptoms associated with grade I or II reactions as well as symptoms of dyspnoea, dysarthria, hoarseness, weakness, confusion, and a feeling of impending doom. Grade IV reactions may include symptoms associated with grade I, II or III reactions as well as loss of consciousness, incontinence of urine or faeces, or cyanosis\n【9】 - Recently published guidelines for the treatment of bee and wasp venom allergy issued by the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology classify systemic reactions as mild, moderate or severe. A mild systemic reaction is characterised by pruritus, urticaria, erythema, mild angio-oedema, rhinitis and conjunctivitis. Moderate systemic reactions may include mild asthma, moderate angio-oedema, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhoea and minor or transient hypotensive symptoms such as light-headedness and dizziness. Severe systemic reactions may include respiratory difficulty such as asthma or laryngeal oedema, hypotension, collapse or loss of consciousness, as well as double incontinence, seizures, or loss of colour vision. Anaphylaxis is defined by the European Resuscitation Council as a severe, life-threatening, generalised or systemic hypersensitivity reaction\n【10】 - Data from the USA suggest that the prevalence of allergy to bee and wasp venom is between 0.4% and 3.3%. In the UK, insect stings are the second most frequent cause of anaphylaxis outside medical settings. It is estimated that of all deaths from anaphylaxis between 1992 and 2001 in the UK, approximately 62% were a result of reactions to wasp venom and approximately 9% were caused by reactions to bee venom. Some people who have a systemic reaction after being stung do not have another reaction when re-stung. It is estimated that after a large local reaction 5–15% of people go on to develop a systemic reaction when next stung. Approximately 14–20% of those who have a mild systemic reaction have another systemic reaction when next stung. For people who have experienced an anaphylactic reaction, the risk of having a recurrent episode is estimated to be between 60% and 70%\n【11】 - The main method for diagnosing an allergy to bee and/or wasp venom is skin testing with venom. Another less sensitive method is measurement of allergen-specific IgE antibodies in serum. Clinicians may also measure serum tryptase at baseline (after a reaction to a sting has subsided) because this may predict the severity of a response to a subsequent sting\n【12】 - Clinicians typically give an emergency kit to people with a venom allergy who are considered at risk of systemic reactions. The kit includes adrenaline (epinephrine; intramuscular injection) and can also include other emergency treatments such as a high-dose antihistamine (oral), a corticosteroid (inhaled), and/or a bronchodilator (inhaled). Preventive measures include advice on how to avoid bee and/or wasp stings\n【13】 - In the UK, clinicians consider offering venom immunotherapy to people with a history of systemic allergic reactions to bee venom and/or wasp venom. Venom immunotherapy aims to reduce the risk of future systemic reactions and the severity of a systemic reaction when one occurs. People considered for venom immunotherapy are usually those who have had severe systemic reactions, or those who have experienced moderate systemic reactions and have additional risk factors, such as a high baseline serum tryptase or a high risk of future stings, or whose quality of life is significantly affected by venom allergy.# The technologies\n【14】 - Pharmalgen bee venom extract (ALK-Abelló) has a marketing authorisation for the treatment of IgE-mediated allergy to bee venom. Pharmalgen wasp venom extract (ALK-Abelló) has a marketing authorisation for the treatment of IgE-mediated allergy to wasp venom. Pharmalgen bee venom extract and Pharmalgen wasp venom extract (from now on referred to as Pharmalgen) also have marketing authorisations for the diagnosis of IgE-mediated allergy to bee or wasp venom, but this indication is outside the scope of this appraisal\n【15】 - Treatment with Pharmalgen is in two phases: an initial phase and a maintenance phase. Before people receive Pharmalgen treatment, IgE-mediated allergy to bee or wasp venom must be confirmed by case history and by in vivo and/or in vitro diagnosis. Pharmalgen is given by subcutaneous injection\n【16】 - During the initial phase, an increasing dose of Pharmalgen is given until the maximum tolerated dose is reached. The following types of dosing schedules can be used during the initial phase: conventional (one injection every 3–7 days), modified rush (clustered; two to four injections weekly given at intervals of 30 minutes) or rush (injections at 2-hour intervals with a maximum of four injections per day). During the maintenance phase, Pharmalgen is administered at a dose of 100 micrograms every 4–6 weeks for at least 3 years. The dosage may be adjusted depending on the person's history of allergic reactions and sensitivity to the specific allergen used\n【17】 - The summary of product characteristics (SPC) as provided by the manufacturer states that Pharmalgen is contraindicated in people with malignancies, severe chronic or seasonal asthma, and immunological conditions. It is also contraindicated in people with diseases or conditions that prevent the treatment of possible anaphylactic reactions, such as chronic heart and lung disease, severe arterial hypertension and treatment with beta-blockers. Pharmalgen is also contraindicated in people taking tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and should not be initiated during pregnancy. Pharmalgen treatment may be associated with local or systemic immunological reactions, which can include anaphylaxis. The SPC recommends that people be observed for at least 60 minutes after an injection of Pharmalgen. For full details of adverse effects and contraindications see the SPC\n【18】 - Pharmalgen bee venom costs £54.81 for an initial treatment set and £63.76 for a maintenance treatment set (excluding VAT; 'British national formulary'  edition 61).The maintenance treatment set includes four vials; therefore, the cost per injection in the maintenance phase is £15.94. Pharmalgen wasp venom costs £67.20 for an initial treatment set and £82.03 for a maintenance treatment set (excluding VAT; BNF edition 61). The maintenance treatment set also includes four vials; therefore, the cost per injection in the maintenance phase is £20.51. Costs may vary in different settings because of negotiated procurement discounts.# Evidence and interpretation\n【19】 - The Appraisal Committee (appendix A) considered evidence from a number of sources (appendix B). The manufacturer of Pharmalgen, ALK-Abelló, did not provide a submission for this appraisal. The Assessment Group (Liverpool Reviews and Implementation Group, LRiG) produced an assessment report of the clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness of Pharmalgen within its licensed indication for the treatment of bee and wasp venom allergy\n【20】 # Clinical effectiveness\n【21】 - The Assessment Group conducted a systematic review of the evidence on the clinical effectiveness of Pharmalgen compared with other treatment options in people with bee and/or wasp venom allergy. Nine studies reported in 11 publications were identified that met the inclusion criteria of the systematic review. All nine of the studies compared Pharmalgen with an active treatment: five compared different doses or dosing schedules of Pharmalgen with each other, one compared Pharmalgen with a modified form of Pharmalgen, and three compared Pharmalgen with other venom immunotherapy. Therefore, none of the studies identified compared Pharmalgen with a non-venom immunotherapy intervention. Of the nine studies identified, four were randomised controlled trials (RCTs), two compared an intervention group with historical controls, and three were quasi-experimental studies. The Assessment Group explored the possibility of conducting a mixed treatment comparison or an indirect comparison, but did not consider either appropriate because of the limitations in the data\n【22】 - The type of allergy and the severity of systemic reactions to stings were specified as inclusion criteria in four of the studies. None of the studies was conducted in the UK. The number of people recruited in each study ranged between 30 and 65. Seven studies included adults only, one study included people aged 15–68 years, and one study included people aged 6–70 years. The average age of participants was similar across studies and ranged between 35 and 49 years. All studies recruited people with allergies to bee or wasp venom confirmed by skin tests, and seven studies also confirmed this with IgE testing. The protocols for the initial phase of treatment differed between studies and varied between 6 and 35 doses, over a period of 3 hours to 16 weeks. Most studies used a maintenance dose of 100 micrograms every 4 weeks. The studies measured outcomes at different time points from 4 days to more than 3 years\n【23】 - The outcome from eight studies in people allergic to bee or wasp venom included the proportion of stings that resulted in systemic reactions. This ranged from 0 to 36.4% depending on the dose of immunotherapy or dosing schedule. Three studies reported proportions of stings that resulted in systemic reactions after approximately 3 years of maintenance therapy; these ranged between 0 and 36.4%. In the study with a rate of 36.4%, three of the four participants with a systemic reaction had a diminished response with mild symptoms. The proportions of stings that resulted in large local reactions was reported in two studies, and ranged from 35.7% to 88.9% across the treatment groups\n【24】 - The Assessment Group presented data on systemic reactions to stings from observational non-comparative studies of Pharmalgen. The Assessment Group found 17 studies that reported the proportion of stings that resulted in systemic reactions before, during or after venom immunotherapy. The reported proportion of stings that resulted in systemic reactions ranged from 0 to 32.7%. For the studies that reported systemic reactions after Pharmalgen treatment, the proportion of stings that resulted in systemic reaction ranged from 0 to 12.5%\n【25】 - People receiving venom immunotherapy may develop an allergic systemic reaction (adverse reaction) to the treatment. Adverse reactions were reported in eight of the studies: in one study during the initial phase only, in five studies during the initial or maintenance phase and in two studies during maintenance only. The proportion of people developing adverse reactions during the initial and maintenance phases of venom immunotherapy ranged from 0 to 38.1%\n【26】 - The Assessment Group also presented evidence from comparative studies of venom immunotherapy other than Pharmalgen. Searches identified one meta-analysis and two systematic reviews of venom immunotherapy (specific brands not specified) in the population of interest. One of the reviews is an ongoing unpublished Cochrane review. The Assessment Group noted that the systematic reviews and the meta-analysis concluded that venom immunotherapy is effective in lowering the risk of future systemic reactions to venom in people with venom allergies\n【27】 - None of the studies identified in the systematic review by the Assessment Group reported data on health-related quality of life. However, the ongoing Cochrane review included two studies that included health-related quality of life data. These studies compared venom immunotherapy (Pharmalgen or non-Pharmalgen venom immunotherapy) with an adrenaline auto-injector, and assessed quality of life using the Vespid Allergy Quality of Life Questionnaire (VQLQ). A meta-analysis of the two studies by the Cochrane group for the outcome change in VQLQ over 1 year concluded that venom immunotherapy was associated with a statistically significant improvement in quality of life compared with an adrenaline auto-injector\n【28】 # Cost effectiveness\n【29】 - The Assessment Group undertook a systematic review of existing cost-effectiveness evidence and developed an economic model of Pharmalgen for the treatment of bee and wasp venom allergy. The systematic review identified three studies, of which two were full papers and one an abstract. The studies were US based with costs expressed in US dollars. The Assessment Group did not find any health economic studies that compared venom immunotherapy with adrenaline auto-injectors, high-dose antihistamine or advice on how to avoid bee and wasp stings (avoidance advice)\n【30】 - The Assessment Group developed a de novo economic model to evaluate the cost effectiveness of Pharmalgen. The model is deterministic and constructed as a 1-year decision tree that is extrapolated to a 10-year time horizon, with changes to the size of the cohort at the end of each year because of sting-related deaths or death from other causes. The Assessment Group chose a 10-year horizon because it identified evidence to support the maintenance of effect over 10 years, and it did not identify any studies that considered a longer follow-up. The analyses were conducted from a UK NHS and personal social services perspective, with costs and benefits discounted at a rate of 3.5%\n【31】 - The Assessment Group used the clinical effectiveness evidence and the results from its own survey of 32 immunology clinicians in allergy centres in the UK, a published audit of UK allergy clinics, and published guidelines to inform the treatment pathway in its economic model. The economic model starts with a person receiving one of three therapies:\n【32】 - venom immunotherapy with Pharmalgen, an emergency kit containing an adrenaline auto-injector and high-dose antihistamine, plus advice on how to avoid being stung, or\n【33】 - an emergency kit containing an adrenaline auto-injector and high-dose antihistamine, plus advice on how to avoid being stung, or\n【34】 - advice on how to avoid being stung\n【35】 - For people treated with Pharmalgen, there is an initial phase with stepwise increases in dosage and a subsequent 3-year maintenance phase. The model includes two forms of dosing in the initial phase: conventional dosing, which lasts 12 weeks with 1 injection per week, and modified rush (clustered) dosing with 16 injections over a 7-week period. The model assumes that 92% of people receive conventional dosing and 8% receive modified rush dosing\n【36】 - The model assumes that a person experiences an average of 0.095 stings per year irrespective of their treatment, based on a weighted average from six studies. A separate analysis explored a scenario in which a person experiences five stings a year. In the model, the probability of a systemic reaction after a sting is 56.4% for people given advice on avoidance only. For people given an emergency kit plus advice on avoidance, the probability of a systemic reaction after a sting is 43.9%. The probability of a systemic reaction after a sting for people receiving Pharmalgen is 6.5%. If a systemic reaction occurs, the likelihood of a Mueller grade I reaction is 6.5%, 9.8% and 38.5% for the advice only, emergency kit and Pharmalgen groups respectively; the likelihood of a Mueller grade II reaction is 80.3%, 83.6% and 54.0%; the likelihood of a Mueller grade III reaction is 12.1%, 6.05% and 7.5%; and the likelihood of a Mueller grade IV reaction is 1.1%, 0.55% and 0%. The model assumes that 1.25% of Mueller grade IV reactions result in death regardless of previous treatment\n【37】 - During venom immunotherapy with Pharmalgen a person may experience an adverse reaction to treatment. The model assumes that the probability of a treatment-related adverse reaction is 2.0% per injection in the initial phase and 0.26% per injection in the maintenance phase. Systemic adverse reactions are classified by Mueller grade; each grade is associated with a particular cost. Of people who experience systemic adverse reactions to treatment, 37.5% experience (by Mueller grade) grade I, 37.5% experience grade II, 12.5% experience grade III, and 12.5% experience grade IV. The model assumes that no deaths result from adverse reactions to venom immunotherapy. The model assumes that treatment with adrenaline auto-injector or high-dose antihistamine is not associated with adverse reactions\n【38】 - The model assumes that bee and wasp venom immunotherapy reduces the risk of a systemic reaction following a sting to the same extent. However, because the cost of bee and wasp venom immunotherapy is different, it was necessary to differentiate between the two venom types. The model assumes that 23% of those with a bee and/or wasp allergy are allergic to bee venom, 70% are allergic to wasp venom and 7% are allergic to both (based on the results of the Assessment Group's survey of immunology clinicians in the UK). The average age of the modelled population is 37 years, and 80% are men\n【39】 - Because no data on health-related quality of life were available, in the base case the model assumes that there are no changes in quality of life associated with venom allergy or venom immunotherapy. The model also assumes no change in quality of life associated with any grade of systemic reaction, either as a result of Pharmalgen treatment or a sting. Therefore, in the base case the model assumes that all health benefits from treatments result from reducing the number of anaphylaxis-related deaths\n【40】 - The Assessment Group undertook a separate analysis for a scenario in which people are assumed to be less anxious about future allergic reactions after receiving Pharmalgen than before receiving therapy, and therefore experience an improvement in quality of life. The analysis quantified quality of life using results of a survey of norms of EQ-5D undertaken by the University. This survey estimated a reduction in utility of 0.16 based on a 'health state characterising level 2 anxiety/depression' which lowers utility by 0.07 per year, and a 'health state characterising usual activities level 2' which lowers utility by 0.036. The Assessment Group assumed that anxiety about stings would reduce utility by 25% of 0.16 (that is, a reduction in utility of 0.04 associated with venom allergy), and that treatment with Pharmalgen would increase utility by 0.01 per person per year\n【41】 - No published information was available on actual resource use so the Assessment Group chose values based on discussions with a clinical specialist. The Assessment Group assumed that the emergency kit contains an adrenaline auto-injector, which is replaced every 18 months, and a high-dose antihistamine, which is replaced annually. The model also included costs for attending accident and emergency and for inpatient stays\n【42】 - The cost of each adverse reaction to Pharmalgen was estimated as £32.81 for a Mueller grade I, II or III reaction and £239.81 for a Mueller grade IV reaction. For all three groups in the model, each systemic reaction to a sting was associated with the cost of attending accident and emergency, with inpatient stays and with antihistamines. The avoidance advice only group included the cost of adrenaline whereas the other two groups included the cost of an adrenaline auto-injector. Costs differed according to severity of the systemic reaction\n【43】 - The Assessment Group presented deterministic pairwise results comparing Pharmalgen plus an emergency kit (adrenaline auto-injector and high-dose antihistamine) plus avoidance advice with two comparators: an emergency kit plus advice or advice alone\n【44】 - The Assessment Group presented base-case results for a simulated 1000 patient cohort. The results showed that treatment with Pharmalgen plus an emergency kit plus avoidance advice provides an additional 0.11 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) per 1000 patients compared with an emergency kit plus avoidance advice, with additional costs of £2,028,808, and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £18,065,527 per QALY gained. Compared with advice only, Pharmalgen plus an emergency kit plus avoidance advice provided an additional 0.29 QALYs per 1000 patients, with additional costs of £2,185,444, leading to an ICER of £7,627,835 per QALY gained\n【45】 - For the scenario assuming five stings per year, the reduction in costs associated with fewer systemic reactions to stings over 10 years, coupled with the additional QALYs generated from fewer deaths, resulted in Pharmalgen dominating both alternatives (that is, it was more effective and less costly than the alternatives)\n【46】 - For the scenario assuming that Pharmalgen improves quality of life by reducing anxiety about future stings, the ICER for Pharmalgen plus an emergency kit plus avoidance advice compared with an emergency kit plus avoidance advice was £23,868 per QALY gained (based on incremental costs of £2,028,808 and incremental QALYs of 85.00 for a 1000 patient cohort). The ICER for Pharmalgen plus an emergency kit plus avoidance advice compared with advice only was £25,661 per QALY gained (incremental costs of £2,185,444 and incremental QALYs of 85.17 for a 1000 patient cohort)\n【47】 - The Assessment Group conducted sensitivity analyses. In the base case, all ICERs for Pharmalgen plus an emergency kit and avoidance advice, compared with an emergency kit and advice, exceeded £1 million per QALY gained irrespective of the scenario or values for parameters used within the model. When compared with advice alone, the ICERs for Pharmalgen plus an emergency kit and advice still exceeded £700,000 per QALY gained\n【48】 - In the sensitivity analyses for the scenario assuming a high rate of stings (five per year), for most changes to parameters in the model, treatment with Pharmalgen dominated the alternatives (being more effective and less costly). The exceptions included a shortened time horizon (5 years), reduced treatment costs for a systemic reaction (50% of the base case) or using the most pessimistic values for all parameters in the model. Assuming 3.3 stings per year, treatment with Pharmalgen plus an emergency kit and avoidance advice no longer dominated the alternatives. Assuming 3.1 stings per year, the ICER for Pharmalgen plus an emergency kit plus avoidance advice was over £30,000 per QALY gained when compared with an emergency kit and advice. Assuming 2.8 stings per year, the ICER for Pharmalgen plus an emergency kit and advice was over £30,000 per QALY gained when compared with advice alone\n【49】 - In the sensitivity analyses for the scenario assuming that Pharmalgen improves quality of life by reducing anxiety about future stings, for most parameters Pharmalgen plus emergency kit plus advice was associated with an ICER of £20,000 to £30,000 per QALY gained. The ICER was above £40,000 per QALY gained when the time horizon was 5 years and below £20,000 per QALY gained when the time horizon was 15 years or longer\n【50】 # Consideration of the evidence\n【51】 - The Appraisal Committee reviewed the data available on the clinical and cost effectiveness of Pharmalgen, having considered evidence on the nature of bee and wasp venom allergy and the value placed on the benefits of Pharmalgen by people with the condition, those who represent them, and clinical specialists. It also took into account the effective use of NHS resources\n【52】 ## Clinical effectiveness\n【53】 - The Committee discussed current clinical practice for the diagnosis of bee or wasp venom allergy. The Committee heard from the clinical specialists that people who have had a systemic reaction following a bee or wasp sting should be referred to an allergy specialist for the diagnosis of venom-specific IgE allergy to bee and/or wasp venom by skin or intradermal testing and serum-specific IgE testing. The clinical specialists stated that raised serum tryptase at baseline (after a reaction to a sting has subsided) is associated with an increased probability of severe systemic reactions to future stings. However the Committee also noted the consultation comment that the immunological condition mastocytosis may be associated with a raised baseline serum tryptase, and a diagnosis of mastocytosis may be a contraindication to Pharmalgen. The Committee understood that before treatment with Pharmalgen, a positive test for specific IgE antibodies is required, and that clinicians would also take into account baseline serum tryptase and other comorbid conditions when deciding whether to offer treatment with Pharmalgen\n【54】 - The Committee discussed the treatment of bee and wasp venom allergy in current clinical practice. The Committee heard from the clinical specialists that people who have had a moderate or severe systemic reaction to bee or wasp venom are normally given an emergency kit containing adrenaline. The kit can also include other emergency treatments such as a high-dose antihistamine. Clinicians also advise people on how to avoid being stung, but they do not consider this advice to be effective on its own. The Committee discussed the use of venom immunotherapy in current clinical practice in the UK. The Committee heard from the clinical specialists that Pharmalgen, the only venom immunotherapy with a UK marketing authorisation, is an established therapy for venom allergy which should be initiated and monitored by healthcare professionals within a specialist centre with experience in venom immunotherapy and treating systemic reactions. The clinical specialists stated that they give Pharmalgen in accordance with the SPCs, most frequently using a conventional dosing schedule in the initial phase, followed by a maintenance period of 3 years. The Committee heard that in children and adults Pharmalgen is considered to provide immunity for at least 15 years. The Committee understood that the regimen of most relevance to the appraisal was an initial phase using a conventional dosing regimen and a maintenance phase lasting 3 years, with the treatment administered within a specialist centre\n【55】 - The Committee discussed which patients currently receive Pharmalgen in clinical practice. It heard from the clinical specialists that Pharmalgen is offered to people with a history of severe systemic reactions to bee or wasp venom, or to people with moderate systemic reactions to bee or wasp venom if they have other risk factors such as raised baseline serum tryptase, a high risk of future stings, or anxiety about future stings. The Committee noted consultation comments that following publication of British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology guidelines, Pharmalgen may also be offered to people with a history of moderate systemic reactions to bee or wasp venom if they live far from emergency medical care, have certain comorbid conditions or request treatment with Pharmalgen. The Committee heard from the clinical specialists that children generally have a less severe reaction to venom than adults and a better prognosis over time. However, it is not possible to identify in advance which children will 'outgrow' their allergy to bee and/or wasp venom, and therefore Pharmalgen is an appropriate treatment for some children. The Committee understood that Pharmalgen is indicated for both adults and children, and that Pharmalgen is offered to people who have had severe systemic reactions or to people who have had moderate systemic reactions, and have additional risk factors for future systemic reactions such as raised baseline serum tryptase, or an increased risk of future stings, or whose quality of life is affected by anxiety about future stings\n【56】 - The Committee discussed the impact of an allergy to bee and/or wasp venom on quality of life. The clinical specialists and patient experts stressed how frightening it is to be stung when there is an expectation of a possible systemic reaction following a sting, and that anaphylaxis can be accompanied by a sense of impending doom. The Committee heard from the patient experts that many people who have experienced a systemic reaction to bee or wasp venom are anxious about the possibility of systemic reactions following future stings, regardless of the actual risk of a reaction. The Committee heard that this anxiety affects usual daily activities of those affected and their family members. The Committee heard that people willingly tolerate the adverse effects of Pharmalgen treatment and the length and intensity of the administration schedule to reduce the probability of a systemic reaction to future stings. The Committee heard from patient experts that after treatment with Pharmalgen, anxiety levels return to normal for many people, and that carrying and having to administer an adrenaline auto-injector does not reduce anxiety to the same degree as having venom immunotherapy. The Committee heard from the clinical specialists that published trials have reported an improvement in quality of life in people who received venom immunotherapy compared with those who received an adrenaline auto-injector only. On balance, the Committee was persuaded that although the extent to which people might feel anxious following a systemic reaction would vary, and the risk of a sting might be very low, many people with a history of systemic reactions to bee or wasp venom would be anxious about the possibility of systemic reactions following future stings\n【57】 - The Committee discussed the relevant comparator in the appraisal. The comparator as set out in the scope is a package of care without venom immunotherapy, including advice on avoidance of insect venom, and high-dose antihistamines and/or adrenaline auto-injectors (with training before use) to be used if stung. The Committee heard from the clinical specialists that the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology recently issued guidelines for the treatment of bee and wasp venom allergy. It heard that clinicians advise people with a history of systemic reactions to bee or wasp venom on ways of minimising their risk of further stings, but do not provide advice alone. Instead clinicians offer people an adrenaline auto-injector (and training in its use) to carry and use following a bee or wasp sting that is accompanied by symptoms of a systemic reaction. The Committee concluded that an adrenaline auto-injector given alongside avoidance advice was the most appropriate comparator for Pharmalgen treatment\n【58】 - The Committee discussed the clinical effectiveness evidence for Pharmalgen and noted that no RCTs or controlled studies had been identified that compared Pharmalgen with standard care without venom immunotherapy, as defined in the scope. The Committee discussed the available non-comparative data for Pharmalgen and the comparative data for non-Pharmalgen venom immunotherapy. The Committee heard from the clinical specialists that they considered that the results of non-Pharmalgen studies would also apply to Pharmalgen, and that venom immunotherapy is associated with changes in IgE production and a reduced risk of a systemic reaction following a sting. The Committee considered that the available evidence base for Pharmalgen was of poor quality and was limited. On balance, it was persuaded that Pharmalgen had demonstrated some efficacy in reducing the rate and severity of systemic reactions following a bee or wasp sting. However, the Committee considered that the relative efficacy could not be quantified with certainty\n【59】 ## Cost effectiveness\n【60】 - The Committee discussed the economic model developed by the Assessment Group. It noted that in the base-case analysis, Pharmalgen plus an adrenaline auto-injector plus high-dose antihistamine and avoidance advice had an ICER of £18,070,000 per QALY gained compared with an adrenaline auto-injector plus high-dose antihistamine and advice. The Committee heard from the Assessment Group that this estimate was robust to changes in parameters associated with costs and effects. However, the estimate was particularly sensitive to assumptions about utility and about how frequently a person is stung. The Committee considered the importance of the assumption in the base-case analysis that Pharmalgen treatment did not affect health-related quality of life. The Committee noted its earlier conclusions that having a venom allergy increases anxiety and affects daily activities, and that treatment with Pharmalgen may reduce some of this anxiety. The Committee concluded that the assumption in the base-case analysis that Pharmalgen had no effect on health-related quality of life underestimated the cost effectiveness of Pharmalgen compared with alternative treatments\n【61】 - The Committee discussed comments received during the consultation about the robustness of the Assessment Group's model. The Committee noted the consultation comments that some of the inputs in the economic model relating to costs, efficacy and the likelihood of having a systemic reaction while receiving treatment with Pharmalgen were not plausible. The Committee considered that although there are some uncertainties as to the plausibility of assumptions and inputs, the Assessment Group's sensitivity analyses showed that the estimates of cost effectiveness were not sensitive to changes in these parameters. The Committee understood from the Assessment Group that the key drivers of cost effectiveness were assumptions about utility and about how frequently a person is stung. On this basis the Committee concluded that the Assessment Group's model was an appropriate basis for decision-making despite uncertainties around the plausibility of some parameter estimates\n【62】 - The Committee considered the Assessment Group's scenario analyses that had assumed that people have five bee or wasp stings per year. The Committee heard from clinical specialists that some people are stung at least five times per year. These may include beekeepers plus their children and neighbours, roofers and gardeners. However, the risk of being stung varies. The Committee noted that in these scenario analyses, treatment with Pharmalgen dominated the alternatives (that is, it was more effective and less costly), and that this remained the case until the average frequency of stings dropped to approximately three per year. The Committee concluded that Pharmalgen is an appropriate use of NHS resources for people with IgE-mediated allergy to bee and wasp venom, who have a high risk of stings\n【63】 - The Committee then considered the scenario analyses that included an effect on health-related quality of life related to anxiety about re-stings and Pharmalgen treatment. The Committee noted that in these analyses the ICER for Pharmalgen decreased to less than £30,000 per QALY gained. The Committee was aware that the Assessment Group had been unable to identify any data on anxiety associated with venom allergy or changes in anxiety as a result of venom immunotherapy that could be used in the economic model. Therefore the Assessment Group had used the EQ-5D survey of norms to explore how much disutility was generated when a person went from having no problems with anxiety and daily activities to moderate anxiety with some effect on daily activities (0.16). The Committee considered that the Assessment Group's assumption that fear of being stung would generate a quarter of that value (0.04), and that venom immunotherapy would reduce this anxiety by a quarter (0.01), was plausible and, given the testimony of the patient experts, may even underestimate the gains in utility associated with treatment with Pharmalgen. The Committee concluded that for people who do not have a high risk of future stings the analyses that assume reduced anxiety about re-stings with Pharmalgen treatment are the most appropriate on which to base the most plausible estimate of the ICER\n【64】 - The Committee considered the 10-year time horizon in the economic model. It was aware that it had not been presented with evidence of the duration of immunity; but it also considered the testimony of the clinical specialists that immunity was likely to be longer than 10 years. The Committee was presented with a scenario analysis with a time horizon of 20 years for people who have a gain in health-related quality of life associated with reduced anxiety about re-stings and treatment with Pharmalgen. In this scenario, the ICER was £13,800 per QALY gained for treatment with Pharmalgen plus an emergency kit plus advice compared with an emergency kit and advice alone. The Committee concluded that it is appropriate to use a time horizon of longer than 10 years, and that with reduced anxiety about re-stings after treatment with Pharmalgen the most plausible ICER would be less than £20,000 per QALY gained. The Committee concluded that Pharmalgen is an appropriate use of NHS resources for people with IgE-mediated allergy to bee and wasp venom, who are anxious about future stings\n【65】 - The Committee then discussed its conclusions on the cost-effectiveness modelling and the use of Pharmalgen in current clinical practice . The Committee took into account the evidence from the clinical specialists and patient experts. It concluded that it was appropriate to assume a health-related quality of life benefit from Pharmalgen for people with a history of severe systemic reactions and for people who have a history of moderate systemic reactions to bee and/or wasp venom and who have other risk factors for future systemic reactions such as anxiety about the possibility of systemic reactions following future stings, a higher risk of being stung or raised baseline serum tryptase. The Committee therefore concluded that Pharmalgen could be considered an appropriate use of NHS resources for the treatment of people with IgE-mediated bee and/or wasp venom allergy with the above characteristics. The Committee considered that anxiety about the possibility of systemic reactions following future stings should be such that it affects usual daily activities\n【66】 - The Committee discussed comments received during consultation, noting that Pharmalgen may also be offered to people with a history of moderate systemic reactions to bee or wasp venom if they live far from emergency medical care, have comorbid conditions or request treatment with Pharmalgen. The Committee discussed the patient expert testimony, and concluded that these people would have heightened awareness of their situation and be anxious about the possible effects of having a systemic reaction from future stings. Therefore the Committee concluded that these groups were covered in its recommendation for people with a history of moderate systemic reactions, who are anxious about future stings\n【67】 - The Committee discussed whether it should make a separate recommendation for people with raised baseline serum tryptase. The Committee noted that people with raised baseline serum tryptase are at higher risk of more severe reactions to future stings but that a person would only be aware of an increased risk once raised baseline serum tryptase had been diagnosed. The Committee also noted the consultation comment that a raised baseline serum tryptase may indicate mastocytosis, which is a possible contraindication for Pharmalgen. The Committee concluded that comorbid conditions, including mastocytosis, would be identified by the responsible clinician when considering whether to offer treatment with Pharmalgen. The Committee concluded that it was appropriate to include in its recommendations raised baseline serum tryptase as an additional risk factor for people who have had a moderate systemic reaction\n【68】 - The Committee supported the statement made by the clinical specialists that treatment with Pharmalgen should be initiated and monitored in a specialist centre experienced in venom immunotherapy. The Committee discussed comments from consultation about the need for specialist centres to have staff appropriately trained in resuscitation or immediate access to age-appropriate resuscitation facilities. It noted that the SPCs specify that Pharmalgen should be provided under supervision of a doctor experienced in specific immunotherapy and that because of the risk of potentially fatal anaphylaxis, treatment with Pharmalgen must be carried out in clinics or hospitals where full facilities for cardiopulmonary resuscitation are immediately available for use by adequately trained personnel. The Committee therefore concluded that Pharmalgen should be provided within a specialist centre and that the details of the provision of resuscitation equipment were sufficiently specified in the SPC\n【69】 # Summaryof Appraisal Committee'skeyconclusions\n【70】 - TA246\n【71】 - Appraisal title: Pharmalgen for the treatment of bee and wasp venom allergy\n【72】 - - Key conclusion\n【73】 - Pharmalgen is recommended as an option for the treatment of IgE-mediated bee and wasp venom allergy in people who have had:\n【74】 - a severe systemic reaction to bee or wasp venom, or\n【75】 - a moderate systemic reaction to bee or wasp venom and who have one or more of the following: a raised baseline serum tryptase, a high risk of future stings or anxiety about future stings\n【76】 - Treatment with Pharmalgen should be initiated and monitored in a specialist centre experienced in venom immunotherapy\n【77】 - The Committee considered the available evidence to be of poor quality and limited.

However, it considered that the relative efficacy could not be quantified with certainty\n【105】 - Evidence for cost effectiveness\n【106】 - Availability and nature of evidence\n【107】 - The Committee considered that the economic model developed by the Assessment Group was appropriate to form the basis of its decision-making, despite uncertainties around the plausibility of some parameter estimates\n【108】 - The Assessment Group was unable to identify any data on anxiety associated with venom allergy or changes in anxiety as a result of venom immunotherapy that could be used in the economic model\n【109】 - Uncertainties around and plausibility of assumptions and inputs in the economic model\n【110】 - The Committee concluded that the assumption in the base-case analysis that Pharmalgen had no effect on health-related quality of life underestimated the cost effectiveness of Pharmalgen compared with alternative treatments\n【111】 - The Committee considered the scenario analyses that had assumed that people have five bee or wasp stings per year.

This involves placing a ring of beads outside of the food pipe, just above the stomach. Magnets inside the beads hold them together to keep the food pipe closed but are weak enough to move apart to allow food or liquid to be swallowed. The aim is to prevent acid reflux\n【2】 # Recommendations\n【3】 - Evidence on the safety and efficacy of laparoscopic insertion of a magnetic ring for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is adequate to support using this procedure provided that standard arrangements are in place for clinical governance, consent and audit. Find out what standard arrangements mean on the NICE interventional procedures guidance page\n【4】 - Patient selection, and the procedure, should be done by clinicians who have specific training in the procedure, and experience in upper gastrointestinal laparoscopic surgery and managing GORD.# The condition, current treatments and procedure\n【5】 # The condition\n【6】 - Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is a common condition in which acid from the stomach flows back up into the oesophagus. It is usually caused by the sphincter at the lower end of the oesophagus becoming weakened. Symptoms of GORD can be directly related to reflux episodes (such as heartburn, regurgitation, chest pain and nausea) or be caused by complications of the disease (such as dysphagia and respiratory difficulties). Repeated episodes of GORD can damage the lining of the oesophagus and lead to oesophageal ulceration, oesophageal stricture and Barrett's oesophagus\n【7】 # Current treatments\n【8】 - NICE's guideline on GORD and dyspepsia in adults: investigation and management describes managing GORD in adults. The standard treatments for symptomatic GORD are lifestyle modification and drug therapy. People may be offered anti-reflux surgery (usually laparoscopic fundoplication) if their symptoms do not improve, or if they develop complications despite medication or they have an intolerance to medication. Endoscopic interventions (such as endoscopic radiofrequency ablation at the gastro‑oesophageal junction) and electrical stimulation of the lower oesophageal sphincter can also be used\n【9】 # The procedure\n【10】 - The aim of laparoscopic insertion of a magnetic ring for GORD is to relieve reflux-related symptoms (such as heartburn or regurgitation) without impeding the ability to swallow, belch or vomit\n【11】 - The procedure is done under general anaesthesia. Using a laparoscopic approach, a specially designed sizing tool is placed around the distal oesophagus to assess the size of implant needed. The sizing tool is then removed, and the implant is placed at the gastro-oesophageal junction, with the posterior vagus nerve trunk located outside the magnetic ring. The ends of the implant are secured together to hold it in place. Intraoperative endoscopy may be used to help identify the anatomic gastro-oesophageal junction and to assess device position\n【12】 - The implant consists of a ring of interlinked beads, each with a weak magnetic force that holds the beads together and reduces reflux. When the person swallows, the magnetic force is overcome, allowing the ring to open. After swallowing, magnetic attraction brings the beads together and the distal oesophagus is again closed", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": "缺少换行#4#4# The condition, current treatments and procedure小标题应换行\n", "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-15 17:51:30", "update_time": "2024-04-15 19:47:40"}

Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection requires that plants, animals, and other organisms be able to produce offspring that are sometimes better adapted to the circumstances of life than the parents are.  It is these offspring that survive and reproduce, and the adaptive traits thus increase in number if they are passed down to the offspring.  If the only changes to be found in offspring were deleterious, adaptive evolution could not occur.  So, the ability to produce enough advantageous variation to allow adaptive evolution to occur is what is called \"evolvability\"\n【2】 - Wagner  describes two definitions of evolvability which have two main meanings. The first one is:\n【3】 - A biological system is evolvable\n【4】 - if its properties show herigenetic variation,\n【5】 - and if natural selection can thus change these properties\n【6】 - The second one is:\n【7】 - if it can acquire novel functions through genetic change, functions that help the organism survive and reproduce\n【8】 - These definitions can be applied on all levels of biological organisation, from macromolecules to mammals\n【9】 - The two meanings are not synonymous. Not all systems that are evolvable in the first sense are evolvable in the second sense. An example is given by Wagner\n【10】 # Example\n【11】 - Consider an enzyme-coding gene that undergoes different mutations in different individuals of a population. Because of the mutations, the activity of the enzyme fluctuates among different individuals. If this mutation is heriand influences fitness than natural selection can act on the enzyme’s activity. The enzyme’s activity is thus evolvable in the first sense. However, after millions of years, no mutation might give this enzyme a trait which might permit survival in a new environment\n【12】 - Thus, although the enzyme’s activity is evolvable in the first sense, that does not mean it is evolvable in the second sense. The opposite, does not work. Every innovative, evolvable system can evolve by natural selection\n【13】 - Organisms are incredibly complex, yet also highly robust to genetic change on all levels of organization. This robustness is one of a few aspects that can affect evolvability in the first and the second sense\n【14】 # Robustness and evolvability\n【15】 - Robustness will not increase evolvability in the first sense. In organisms with a high level of robustness, mutations will have smaller phenotypic effects than in organisms with a low level of robustness. Thus, robustness reduces the amount of herigenetic variation on which selection can act\n【16】 - One can see this conclusion in two ways:\n【17】 - The first way is that robustness causes mutations to be neutral and therefore no innovation will occur\n【18】 - The second way gives neutral mutations an important function in innovation. Although many neutral mutations do not change primary functions, they can change other system features for future evolution\n【19】 - So, robustness can facilitate exaptation. From this point of view, robustness implies that many mutations are neutral and such neutrality promotes innovation", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-15 17:51:30", "update_time": "2024-04-15 19:57:28"}

The QT interval is a general measure of how long it takes for the heart to recharge or repolarize itself electrically. The QT interval is dependent on the heart rate such that the faster the heart rate, the shorter the QT interval.  As a result, the QT interval must be adjusted for the heart rate for accurate interpretation.  This adjustment is called the corrected QT interval or QTc. A lengthened QT interval is a biomarker for ventricular tachyarrhythmias such as torsades de pointes and is a risk factor for sudden cardiac death\n【4】 # Historical Perspective\n【5】 - The standard clinical correction is to use Bazett's formula, named after physiologist Henry Cuthbert Bazett, calculating the heartrate-corrected QT interval QTc\n【6】 - The formula is as follows:\n【7】 - QTc = \\frac{QT}{\\sqrt {RR} },\n【8】 - where QTc is the QT interval corrected for rate, and RR is the interval from the onset of one QRS complex to the onset of the next QRS complex, measured in seconds.  However, this formula tends to not be accurate, and over-corrects at high heart rates and under-corrects at low heart rates\n【9】 - In the same year, Fridericia  published an alternative adjustment:\n【10】 - QT_F = \\frac{QT}{RR^{1/3} }\n【11】 - There are several other methods, but a regression based approach is the most accurate according to the current knowledge. An example of the regression-based approach is that developed by Sagie et al., as follows:\n【12】 - QT_S = QT + 0.154(1-RR)\n【13】 # Measurement\n【14】 - Normal values for the QT interval are between 0.30 and 0.44 (0.45 for women) seconds\n【15】 - QT interval can be measured by different methods such as the threshold method in which the end of the T wave is determined by the point at which the component of the T wave merges with the isoelectric baseline or the tangent method in which the end of the T wave is determined by the intersection of a line extrapolated from the isoelectric baseline and the tangent line which touches the terminal part of the T wave at the point of maximium downslope\n【16】 - Shown below is an example of normal QT interval\n【17】 - The QT interval is an important ECG parameter and the identification of ECGs with long QT syndrome is of clinical importance. Considering the required standards for precision, the measurement of QT interval is subjective. This is because the end of the T wave is not always clearly defined and usually merges gradually with the baseline. QT interval in an ECG complex can be measured manually by different methods such as the threshold method, in which the end of the T wave is determined by the point at which the component of the T wave merges with the isoelectric baseline or the tangent method, in which the end of the T wave is determined by the intersection of a line extrapolated from the isoelectric baseline and the tangent line, which touches the terminal part of the T wave at the point of maximum downslope\n【18】 - With the increased availability of digital ECGs with simultaneous 12-channel recording, QT measurement may also be done by the 'superimposed median beat' method. In the superimposed median beat method, a median ECG complex is constructed for each of the 12 leads. The 12 median beats are superimposed on each other and the QT interval is measured either from the earliest onset of the Q wave to the latest offset of the T wave or from the point of maximum convergence for the Q wave onset to the T wave offset\n【19】 # Natural History, Complications and Prognosis\n【20】 - If the QT interval is abnormally prolonged or shortened, there is a risk of developing ventricular arrhythmias\n【21】 ## Genetic Causes\n【22】 - An abnormal prolonged QT interval could be due to Long QT syndrome, whereas an abnormal shortened QT interval could be due to Short QT syndrome\n【23】 ## Due to adverse drug reactions\n【24】 - Prolongation of the QT interval may be due to an adverse drug reaction.

With the availability of new evidence, the GU DSG chose to conduct an update of the evidence and recommendations in the fall of 2009. A review of the evidence published since February 2008 is presented here, A, of this report\n【1】 - The evidence-based series guidelines developed by Cancer Care Ontario's PEBC use the methods of the Practice Guidelines Development Cycle . For this project, the core methodology used to develop the evidentiary base was the systematic review. Evidence was selected and reviewed by two members of the GU DSG and methodologists\ned in B, forms the basis of a clinical practice guideline developed by the GU DSG found in  of this evidence-based series. The systematic review and companion recommendations are intended to promote evidence-based practice in Ontario, Canada. The PEBC is supported by the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care through Cancer Care Ontario. All work produced by the PEBC is editorially independent from its funding source\n【3】 # Literature Search Strategy\n【4】 - Relevant articles published since February 2008 were identified by searches of MEDLINE (2008 -September 2009 week 1), EMBASE (2008 -2009 week 37), and the Cochrane Library (2009, Issue 4). The updated MEDLINE and EMBASE search strategies are detailed in\n【5】 - The conference proceedings of the 2008 and 2009 annual meetings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, the American Society for Radiation Oncology, the American Urological Association, and the European Association of Urology were also searched for relevant trials\n【6】 # Study Selection Criteria\n【7】 - The study selection criteria used in the original systematic review  were adopted for the 2010 update. This included RCTs, systematic reviews, or clinical practice guidelines in which adjuvant RT in the immediate postoperative period after radical prostatectomy was compared to observation, with other therapies including RT and ADT held in reserve for salvage. The patients had prostate cancer and were found at prostatectomy to have either extracapsular extension (now more commonly referred to as extraprostatic extension), seminal vesicle invasion, positive surgical resection margins, or more than one of these features\n【8】 # Synthesizing the Evidence\n【9】 - Assessment of study quality followed the same procedure as in the original systematic review\n【10】 - OS, prostate cancer-specific survival, metastasis-free survival, bPFS, locoregional recurrence-free survival, time to initiation of ADT, acute and late toxicity, and quality of life were the outcomes of interest, as in the original systematic review. When data were available on these outcomes from two or more trials, meta-analysis of the trial data was planned using the Review Manager software (RevMan 5.0.22) provided by the Cochrane Collaboration. 1\n【11】 # Literature Search Results\n【12】 - In the original search, a total of 14 reports  representing three randomized trials satisfied the eligibility criteria. The main reports of the two trials were published as full articles\n【13】 Post-hoc analyses of the SWOG trial were also identified  was identified, but the systematic review is not yet available\n【14】 # Trial Characteristics\n【15】 - No new results from the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 22911 trial  have been published since the original version of the systematic review was completed. The GU DSG contacted the EORTC trial committee in October 2009 and at that time there was no definite timeline in place for an updated trial report. While the initial report of SWOG 8794  was based on analysis at a median followup of 10.6 years, the updated report published in 2009  extends median follow-up to 12.6 years. The ARO/AUO trial was published in a full report in 2009 . Study characteristics in the updated reports remained the same as the original reports. Major characteristics of the three trials  are summarized in  The updated trial data are shown in italics\n【16】 # Trial Quality\n【17】 - The results of the trial quality assessment are summarized in  The three trials met all of the trial quality criteria\n【18】 - The updated report on the SWOG trial  presented new data for the outcomes of OS and metastasis-free survival. The ARO/AUO trial  did not provide new time-to-event analyses beyond those reported in the 2007 abstract. Trial results are summarized in , and proceeding text only addresses outcomes with updated results\n【19】 # Overall Survival\n【20】 - While the original 2006 report of the SWOG trial  showed no difference between treatment groups for OS, the updated report in 2009  showed a significant improvement in overall survival with adjuvant RT (hazard ratio 0.72; 95% confidence interval 0.55 to 0.96; p=0.023). At the time of the update, 88 of 214 men randomized to adjuvant RT had died versus 110 of 211 men randomized to observation. Ten-year OS was 74% and 66% for those randomized to adjuvant RT and observation, respectively. Median survival was 15.2 years with adjuvant RT and 13.3 years with observation\n【21】 - No new results from the EORTC 22911 trial have been published since the initial version of this review was completed. Only short term (five-year) results from the 2005 trial publication are available . At the time of publication, 43 deaths had occurred in the observation arm and 46 deaths in the adjuvant RT arm (HR, 1.09; 98% CI, 0.67 to 1.79; p=0.6796). This represents an event rate for death of only 8.9%. In view of the immaturity of these results, the GU DSG felt that inclusion of these data in a meta-analysis was inappropriate and no such meta-analysis has therefore been undertaken. Longer term results from the EORTC trial are awaited and once available will be incorporated into a meta-analysis with the SWOG 8794 results\n【22】 # Metastasis-Free Survival\n【23】 - Only the SWOG trial  provided data on this outcome. In the updated report, adjuvant RT reduced death or metastatic disease by 29% compared with observation (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.94; p=0.016). Ten-year metastasis-free survival was 71% in those randomized to adjuvant RT and 61% in those randomized to observation\n【24】 # Acuteand Late Toxicity\n【25】 - The full report of the ARO/AUO trial  did not report early and late toxicity data separately; instead, cumulative rates of toxicity over the entire follow-up period were reported. In the adjuvant RT group, one patient experienced grade 3 GU (bladder) adverse effects, three patients (2%) experienced grade 2 GU adverse events, and two patients (1.4%) experienced grade 2 gastrointestinal adverse effects. No adverse effects ≥ grade 2 were experienced by the observation group. Overall, the cumulative rate of adverse effects for bladder and rectum ≥ grade 1 was 21.9% in the adjuvant RT group and 3.7% in the observation group (p<0.0001). The updated report of the SWOG trial  did not include toxicity outcomes\n【26】 # Subgroup Analyses\n【27】 - The three trials included in this review enrolled patients with positive surgical margins, extracapsular extension, or seminal vesicle invasion. (Strictly speaking, it should be noted that a positive margin alone was not sufficient for entry into the ARO/AUO trial if unaccompanied by pathologic T3 disease.) It is therefore of interest to assess the relative benefit of adjuvant RT in subgroups defined by the presence or absence of these characteristics. Exploratory analyses across these pathologic subgroups have been published for each of the three trials. Two subgroup analyses of the EORTC trial . The outcome of interest was bPFS. The analysis took account of a central pathology review in 85% of cases, while local pathology review was employed for the remaining 15% of cases\n【28】 - In each of the three trials, randomization was stratified with respect to these pathologic characteristics, whether considered singly or in combination . Hence, the adjuvant RT and observation arms in each trial are likely to be well balanced with respect to these characteristics. In addition, the definitions of bPFS employed across the three trials were similar. In view of this, meta-analysis of the bPFS subgroup data was performed by members of the GU DSG and is to be presented at the 2010 annual meetings of the Canadian Association of Radiation Oncology  and the American Society for Radiation Oncology . It should be noted that, of the two published post-hoc analyses of the EORTC trial . Stated alternatively, each of the three constituent pathologic subgroups included in these trials experienced a significant survival benefit from adjuvant RT that was independent of the others\n【29】 - An additional comment is necessary regarding the group free of extracapsular extension. This is the only subgroup in which the HR for OS favoured observation. Absence of extracapsular extension in this context should not be assumed to be synonymous with pT2 R1 disease. As pathologic variables were coded independently in the SWOG trial database, the extracapsular extension-absent subgroup is a collection of patients with either pT2 R1 disease or pT3b R0-1 disease without coexisting capsular extension. As such, this is a very heterogeneous group, that is not representative of the population at large with organconfined, margin-positive disease, and the result is therefore not generalizable to it. It is also a small subgroup (n=85), as evidenced by the broad confidence interval. Finally, the possibility exists that this is a spurious result that has arisen from an exploratory analysis involving multiple comparisons\n【30】 - For these reasons, the GU DSG cautions against overinterpretation of the outlying result seen in this subgroup\n【31】 - It is noteworthy that in all six subgroups examined (positive and negative surgical margins, presence and absence of extracapsular extension, and presence and absence of seminal vesicle invasion), adjuvant RT conferred a statistically significant benefit in terms of bPFS. The magnitude of benefit was broadly similar across all groups, with the pooled HR ranging from 0.45 (in the case of patients with positive margins) to 0.61 (in the case of patients with negative margins). The finding of benefit across all subgroups conflicts with both the EORTC subgroup analysis based on central pathologic review  and the ARO/AUO subgroup analysis , in which the margin-negative population did not benefit from adjuvant RT\n【32】 - It should be acknowledged finally that the population of patients enrolled in these trials with positive surgical margins may not be representative of the general population at large with positive margins following prostatectomy. While a positive margin alone was sufficient for entry into the EORTC and SWOG trials (pT3 disease was a requirement for entry into the ARO/AUO trial), relatively few patients whose only adverse feature was a positive margin were enrolled. For example, in the EORTC trial, 629 of the 1005 enrolled patients possessed positive surgical margins. Among these, in only 163 cases (26%) was the positive margin the only adverse feature present (i.e., pT2 R1 disease), while in the remaining 466 cases (74%) the positive margin occurred in the presence of either extracapsular extension of seminal vesicle invasion (i.e., pT3 R1 disease). Additional study of the impact of adjuvant radiotherapy in patients with organ-confined, margin-positive disease is therefore warranted\n【33】 # INTERPRETATION AND DISCUSSION\n【34】 - Since the initial publication of this systematic review in 2008, updated results from one of the three included RCTs  are now available. At a median follow-up of 12.6 years, adjuvant RT has now been shown to confer a significant benefit in terms of both OS and metastasis-free survival. The significance of these findings warrants re-statement; for the first time, a largescale RCT has shown that an adjuvant therapy given after prostatectomy improves longevity and reduces distant failure compared to a policy of observation and salvage therapy. The magnitude of the observed benefit is substantial; median survival is prolonged by 1.9 years with adjuvant RT. A number-needed-to-treat analysis reveals that, compared to the observation and salvage strategy employed in the trial, nine courses of adjuvant RT are required to prevent one death by 12.6 years of median follow-up. Placed in context, this is similar to the magnitude of benefit seen with post-mastectomy RT given for node-positive breast cancer\n【35】 - Results from the EORTC trial are not sufficiently mature to draw conclusions regarding the effect of adjuvant RT on OS in this trial. At a median follow-up of five years, only 8.9% of trial participants had died at the time of the most recent report . Longer term results from this trial and from the ARO/AUO trial-in which only 4% of patients have died to date-are awaited. Updates of this systematic review, and the clinical practice guideline of which it forms the basis, will be undertaken once new survival data are available\n【36】 - In terms of pathologic findings, a fairly heterogeneous population of patients was enrolled in each of the three trials. They included men with positive resection margins, capsular breach, or seminal vesicle invasion, and no limitations were placed on Gleason score. The results of subgroup analysis of the SWOG trial with OS as primary endpoint are striking; the benefit in OS conferred by adjuvant RT applies not only to the trial population as a whole, but also to the individual populations of patients with a positive surgical margin, extracapsular extension, or seminal vesicle invasion when considered separately. Further, the pooled subgroup analysis of the three trials with bPFS as primary endpoint demonstrates a clear and statistically significant benefit for adjuvant RT in all subgroups. This is a new finding and is at odds with previously published post-hoc analyses of the EORTC  and ARO/AUO  trials wherein no significant bPFS benefit was seen in patients with pathologic T3 disease but negative surgical margins. On the basis of the overall trial findings as well as these subgroup analyses, it can be concluded that men found at radical prostatectomy to have any of positive surgical margins, extracapsular extension, or seminal vesicle invasion benefit from adjuvant RT. As noted above, further study of those patients with organconfined, margin-positive disease is warranted to better define the impact of adjuvant radiotherapy in this setting\n【37】 # ONGOING TRIALS\n【38】 - While updated results from the SWOG trial  indicate the clear superiority of adjuvant RT over the observation and salvage therapy policy employed in the trial, it remains uncertain whether the superiority of adjuvant RT would remain if it were compared to a strict policy of close surveillance with salvage RT initiated at the earliest sign of biochemical recurrence. The latter approach holds the potential advantage of avoiding RT, and its side effects, in those that do not ultimately recur biochemically following surgery. Determining which of these approaches is optimal requires well-designed phase III trials. Fortunately, three such RCTs comparing adjuvant and early salvage approaches to postoperative RT are now underway. Features of these trials, which were identified on a search of the National Cancer Institute trials registry at , are summarized below. The GU DSG will monitor the progress of the trials and review reported results when they become available\n【39】 # Protocol ID Titleanddetailsoftrial MRC/NCIC-RADICALS-PR10 NCT00541047\n【40】 - Phase III randomized study of immediate vs. early salvage radiotherapy (RT) and short-vs. long-term androgen deprivation therapy in patients who have undergone local surgery for non-metastatic adenocarcinoma of the prostate\n【41】 1 RT timing randomization Arm I -immediate RT; Arm II -early salvage RT in case of PSA failure. In both arms, RT is delivered, according to clinician preference, either to 66 Gy in 33 fractions or 52.5 Gy in 20 fractions to the prostate bed\n【42】 2 Hormonal therapy during randomization Arm I -0 months; Arm II -6 months; Arm III -24 months. During the pilot phase, patients may elect to be randomized between only 2 of these 3 arms\n【43】 - In the only RCT for which long-term follow-up data are available, adjuvant RT following radical prostatectomy in patients with pathologic T3 or margin-positive prostate cancer has been shown to improve OS and reduce distant metastases compared to observation. The OS benefit extends individually to the subgroups with positive surgical margins, extracapsular extension, and seminal vesicle invasion. Longer follow-up from the other two completed RCTs is awaited and this review will be updated once new data become available\n【44】 # CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n【45】 - There are no known conflicts of interest\n【46】 # Funding The PEBCissupportedbythe Ontario Ministryof Healthand Long-Term Carethrough Cancer Care\n【47】 - Ontario.

The PSA test measures the level of PSA in the blood. The doctor takes a blood sample, and the amount of PSA is measured in a laboratory. Because PSA is produced by the body and can be used to detect disease, it is sometimes called a biological marker or tumor marker\n【3】 - It is normal for men to have low levels of PSA in their blood; however, prostate cancer or benign (not cancerous) conditions can increase PSA levels. As men age, both benign prostate conditions and prostate cancer become more frequent. The most common benign prostate conditions are prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate) and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) (enlargement of the prostate). There is no evidence that prostatitis or BPH causes cancer, but it is possible for a man to have one or both of these conditions and to develop prostate cancer as well\n【4】 - PSA levels alone do not give doctors enough information to distinguish between benign prostate conditions and cancer. However, the doctor will take the result of the PSA test into account when deciding whether to check further for signs of prostate cancer\n【5】 # Why is the PSA test performed?\n【6】 - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the PSA test along with a digital rectal exam (DRE) to help detect prostate cancer in men age 50 and older. During a DRE, a doctor inserts a gloved finger into the rectum and feels the prostate gland through the rectal wall to check for bumps or abnormal areas. Doctors often use the PSA test and DRE as prostate cancer screening tests; together, these tests can help doctors detect prostate cancer in men who have no symptoms of the disease\n【7】 - The FDA has also approved the PSA test to monitor patients with a history of prostate cancer to see if the cancer has recurred (come back). If the PSA level begins to rise, it may be the first sign of recurrence. Such a biochemical relapse typically precedes clinical relapse by months or years. However, a single elevated PSA level in a patient with a history of prostate cancer does not always mean the cancer has come back. A man who has been treated for prostate cancer should discuss an elevated PSA level with his doctor. The doctor may recommend repeating the PSA test or performing other tests to check for evidence of recurrence. The doctor may look for a trend of rising PSAs over time rather than a single elevated PSA\n【8】 - It is important to note that a man who is receiving hormone therapy for prostate cancer may have a low PSA reading during, or immediately after, treatment. The low level may not be a true measure of PSA activity in the man’s body. Men receiving hormone therapy should talk with their doctor, who may advise them to wait a few months after hormone treatment before having a PSA test\n【9】 # For whom might a PSA screening test be recommended?\n【10】 - Doctors’ recommendations for screening vary. Some encourage yearly screening for men over age 50, and some advise men who are at a higher risk for prostate cancer to begin screening at age 40 or 45. Others caution against routine screening, while still others counsel men about the risks and benefits on an individual basis and encourage men to make personal decisions about screening. Currently, Medicare provides coverage for an annual PSA test for all men age 50 and older\n【11】 - Several risk factors increase a man’s chances of developing prostate cancer. These factors may be taken into consideration when a doctor recommends screening. Age is the most common risk factor, with nearly 65 percent of prostate cancer cases occurring in men age 65 and older . Other risk factors for prostate cancer include family history, race, and possibly diet. Men who have a father or brother with prostate cancer have a greater chance of developing prostate cancer. African American men have the highest rate of prostate cancer, while Asian and Native American men have the lowest rates. In addition, there is some evidence that a diet higher in fat, especially animal fat, may increase the risk of prostate cancer\n【12】 # How are PSA test results reported?\n【13】 - PSA test results report the level of PSA detected in the blood. The test results are usually reported as nanograms of PSA per milliliter (ng/mL) of blood. In the past, most doctors considered PSA values below 4.0 ng/mL as normal. However, recent research found prostate cancer in men with PSA levels below 4.0 ng/mL . Many doctors are now using the following ranges with some variation:\n【14】 0 to 2.5 ng/mL is low\n【15】 2.6 to 10 ng/mL is slightly to moderately elevated\n【16】 10 to 19.9 ng/mL is moderately elevated\n【17】 20 ng/mL or more is significantly elevated\n【18】 - There is no specific normal or abnormal PSA level. The higher a man’s PSA level, the more likely it is that cancer is present. But because various factors (such as age) can cause PSA levels to fluctuate, one abnormal PSA test does not necessarily indicate a need for other diagnostic tests. When PSA levels continue to rise over time, other tests may be needed\n【19】 - It should be noted that it is common for normal PSA ranges to vary somewhat from laboratory to laboratory\n【20】 # What if the screening test results show an elevated PSA level?\n【21】 - A man should discuss elevated PSA test results with his doctor. There can be different reasons for an elevated PSA level, including prostate cancer, benign prostate enlargement, inflammation, infection, age, and race\n【22】 - If no other symptoms suggest cancer, the doctor may recommend repeating DRE and PSA tests regularly to watch for any changes. If a man’s PSA levels have been increasing or if a suspicious lump is detected during the DRE, the doctor may recommend other tests to determine if there is cancer or another problem in the prostate. A urine test may be used to detect a urinary tract infection or blood in the urine. The doctor may recommend imaging tests, such as ultrasound (a test in which high-frequency sound waves are used to obtain images of the kidneys and bladder), x-rays, or cystoscopy (a procedure in which a doctor looks into the urethra and bladder through a thin, lighted tube). Medicine or surgery may be recommended if the problem is BPH or an infection\n【23】 - If cancer is suspected, a biopsy is needed to determine if cancer is present in the prostate. During a biopsy, samples of prostate tissue are removed, usually with a needle, and viewed under a microscope. The doctor may use ultrasound to view the prostate during the biopsy, but ultrasound cannot be used alone to tell if cancer is present\n【24】 # What if the test results show a rising PSA level after treatment for prostate cancer?\n【25】 - A man should discuss rising PSA test levels with his doctor. Doctors consider a number of factors before recommending further treatment. Additional treatment based on a single PSA test result is often not recommended. Rather, a rising trend in PSA test results over a period of time combined with other findings, such as an abnormal DRE, positive prostate biopsy results, or abnormal CT (computed tomography) scan results, may lead to a recommendation for further treatment\n【26】 - According to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology for Prostate Cancer , additional treatment may be indicated based on the following PSA test results:\n【27】 - For men who have been in the watchful waiting phase—PSA levels have doubled in fewer than 3 years or PSA velocity (change in PSA levels over time) is greater than 0.75 ng/mL, in addition to a prostate biopsy showing evidence of worsening cancer\n【28】 - For men who have had a radical prostatectomy (removal of the prostate gland)—PSA does not fall to undeteclevels after surgery or a detecPSA (> 0.3 ng/mL) that increases on two or more subsequent measurements after having undeteclevels\n【29】 - For men who have had other initial therapy, such as radiation therapy and/or hormonal therapy—PSA levels have risen three consecutive times at least 3 months apart after having reached an undetecor very low level\n【30】 - Please note that these are general guidelines. Prostate cancer is a complex disease and many variables need to be considered by each patient and his doctor\n【31】 # What are some of the limitations of the PSA test?\n【32】 - Detection does not always mean saving lives: When used in screening, the PSA test can detect small tumors. However, finding a small tumor does not necessarily reduce a man’s chance of dying from prostate cancer. PSA testing may identify very slow-growing tumors that are unlikely to threaten a man’s life. Also, PSA testing may not help a man with a fast-growing or aggressive cancer that has already spread to other parts of his body before being detected\n【33】 - False positive tests: False positive test results (also called false positives) occur when the PSA level is elevated but no cancer is actually present. False positives may lead to additional medical procedures that have potential risks and significant financial costs and can create anxiety for the patient and his family. Most men with an elevated PSA test turn out not  to have cancer; only 25 to 30 percent of men who have a biopsy due to elevated PSA levels actually have prostate cancer\n【34】 - False negative tests: False negative test results (also called false negatives) occur when the PSA level is in the normal range even though prostate cancer is actually present. Most prostate cancers are slow-growing and may exist for decades before they are large enough to cause symptoms. Subsequent PSA tests may indicate a problem before the disease progresses significantly\n【35】 # Why is the PSA test controversial in screening?\n【36】 - Using the PSA test to screen men for prostate cancer is controversial because it is not yet known if this test actually saves lives. Moreover, it is not clear if the benefits of PSA screening outweigh the risks of follow-up diagnostic tests and cancer treatments. For example, the PSA test may detect small cancers that would never become life threatening. This situation, called overdiagnosis, puts men at risk for complications from unnecessary treatment such as surgery or radiation\n【37】 - The procedure used to diagnose prostate cancer (prostate biopsy) may cause side effects, including bleeding and infection. Prostate cancer treatment may cause incontinence (inability to control urine flow) and erectile dysfunction (erections inadequate for intercourse). For these reasons, it is important that the benefits and risks of diagnostic procedures and treatment be taken into account when considering whether to undertake prostate cancer screening\n【38】 # What research is being done to validate and improve the PSA test?\n【39】 - The benefits of screening for prostate cancer are still being studied. The National Cancer Institute (NCI), a component of the National Institutes of Health, is currently conducting the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial, or PLCO trial, to determine if certain screening tests reduce the number of deaths from these cancers. The DRE and PSA are being studied to determine whether yearly screening to detect prostate cancer will decrease a man’s chance of dying from prostate cancer. Full results from this study are expected in several years\n【40】 - Scientists also are researching ways to distinguish between cancerous and benign conditions, and between slow-growing cancers and fast-growing, potentially lethal cancers. Some of the methods being studied are:\n【41】 - PSA velocity: PSA velocity is the change in PSA levels over time. A sharp rise in the PSA level raises the suspicion of cancer and may indicate a fast growing cancer. A 2006 study found that men who had a PSA velocity above 0.35 ng/mL per year had a higher relative risk of dying from prostate cancer than men who had a PSA velocity less than 0.35 ng/mL per year . More studies are needed to determine if high PSA velocity more accurately detects prostate cancer early\n【42】 - Age-adjusted PSA: Age is an important factor in increasing PSA levels. For this reason, some doctors use age-adjusted PSA levels to determine when diagnostic tests are needed. When age-adjusted PSA levels are used, a different PSA level is defined as normal for each 10-year age group. Doctors who use this method generally suggest that men younger than age 50 should have a PSA level below 2.4 ng/mL, while a PSA level up to 6.5 ng/mL would be considered normal for men in their 70s. Doctors do not agree about the accuracy and usefulness of age-adjusted PSA levels\n【43】 - PSA density: PSA density considers the relationship of the PSA level to the size of the prostate. In other words, an elevated PSA might not arouse suspicion if a man has a very enlarged prostate. The use of PSA density to interpret PSA results is controversial because cancer might be overlooked in a man with an enlarged prostate\n【44】 - Free versus attached PSA: PSA circulates in the blood in two forms: free or attached to a protein molecule. The free PSA test is more often used for men who have higher PSA values. Free PSA may help tell what kind of prostate problem a man has. With benign prostate conditions (such as BPH), there is more free PSA, while cancer produces more of the attached form. If a man’s attached PSA is high but his free PSA is not, the presence of cancer is more likely. In this case, more testing, such as prostate biopsy, may be done. Researchers are exploring different ways to measure PSA and to compare these measurements to determine if cancer is present\n【45】 - Alteration of PSA cutoff level: Some researchers have suggested lowering the cutoff levels that determine if a PSA measurement is normal or elevated. For example, a number of studies have used cutoff levels of 2.5 or 3.0 ng/mL (rather than 4.0 ng/mL). In such studies, PSA measurements above 2.5 or 3.0 ng/mL are considered elevated. Researchers hope that using these lower cutoff levels will increase the chance of detecting prostate cancer; however, this method may also increase overdiagnosis and false positive test results and lead to unnecessary medical procedures\n【46】 - Protein patterns: Scientists are also studying a test that can rapidly analyze the patterns of various proteins in the blood. Researchers hope that this technique can determine if a biopsy is necessary when a person has a slightly elevated PSA level or an abnormal DRE\n【47】 - For additional information about prostate cancer, contact the NCI’s Cancer Information Service", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-15 17:51:29", "update_time": "2024-04-15 21:20:04"}

Common adverse reactions include hypoglycemia,  nausea, epigastric fullness, heartburn,  pruritus, erythema, urticaria, leukopenia, agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia\n【5】 # Adult Indicationsand Dosage\n【6】 # FDA-Labeled Indicationsand Dosage( Adult)\n【7】 - Tolazamide ts are indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus\n【8】 - There is no fixed dosage regimen for the management of diabetes mellitus with tolazamide ts or any other hypoglycemic agent. In addition to the usual monitoring of urinary glucose, the patient’s blood glucose must also be monitored periodically to determine the minimum effective dose for the patient; to detect primary failure, i.e., inadequate lowering of blood glucose at the maximum recommended dose of medication; and to detect secondary failure, i.e., loss of an adequate blood glucose-lowering response after an initial period of effectiveness. Glycosylated hemoglobin levels may also be of value in monitoring the patient’s response to therapy\n【9】 - Short-term administration of tolazamide may be sufficient during periods of transient loss of control in patients usually controlled well on diet\n【10】 - The usual starting dose of tolazamide ts for the mild to moderately severe type II diabetic patient is 100 mg to 250 mg daily administered with breakfast or the first main meal. Generally, if the fasting blood glucose is less than 200 mg/dL the starting dose is 100 mg/day as a single daily dose. If the fasting blood glucose value is greater than 200 mg/dL, the starting dose is 250 mg/day as a single dose. If the patient is malnourished, underweight, elderly, or not eating properly, the initial therapy should be 100 mg once a day. Failure to follow an appropriate dosage regimen may precipitate hypoglycemia. Patients who do not adhere to their prescribed dietary regimen are more prone to exhibit unsatisfactory response to drug therapy\n【11】 - Transfer of patients from other oral antidiabetes regimens to tolazamide should be done conservatively. When transferring patients from oral hypoglycemic agents other than chlorpropamide to tolazamide, no transition period or initial or priming dose is necessary. When transferring from chlorpropamide, particular care should be exercised to avoid hypoglycemia\n【12】 - If receiving less than 1 gm/day, begin at 100 mg of tolazamide per day. If receiving 1 gm or more per day, initiate at 250 mg of tolazamide per day as a single dose\n【13】 250 mg of chlorpropamide may be considered to provide approximately the same degree of blood glucose control as 250 mg of tolazamide. The patient should be observed carefully for hypoglycemia during the transition period from chlorpropamide to tolazamide (1 to 2 weeks) due to the prolonged retention of chlorpropamide in the body and the possibility of a subsequent overlapping drug effect\n【14】 100 mg of tolazamide may be considered to provide approximately the same degree of blood glucose control as 250 mg of acetohexamide\n【15】 - Some type II diabetic patients who have been treated only with insulin may respond satisfactorily to therapy with tolazamide. If the patient’s previous insulin dosage has been less than 20 units, substitution of 100 mg of tolazamide per day as a single daily dose may be tried. If the previous insulin dosage was less than 40 units, but more than 20 units, the patient should be placed directly on 250 mg of tolazamide per day as a single dose. If the previous insulin dosage was greater than 40 units, the insulin dosage should be decreased by 50% and 250 mg of tolazamide per day started. The dosage of tolazamide should be adjusted weekly (or more often in the group previously requiring more than 40 units of insulin)\n【16】 - During this conversion period when both insulin and tolazamide are being used, hypoglycemia may rarely occur. During insulin withdrawal, patients should test their urine for glucose and acetone at least 3 times daily and report results to their physician. The appearance of persistent acetonuria with glycosuria indicates that the patient is a type I diabetic who requires insulin therapy\n【17】 - Daily doses of greater than 1000 mg are not recommended. Patients will generally have no further response to doses larger than this\n【18】 - The usual maintenance dose is in the range of 100 to 1000 mg/day with the average maintenance dose being 250 to 500 mg/day. Following initiation of therapy, dosage adjustment is made in increments of 100 mg to 250 mg at weekly intervals based on the patient’s blood glucose response\n【19】 - Once a day therapy is usually satisfactory. Doses up to 500 mg/day should be given as a single dose in the morning. 500 mg once daily is as effective as 250 mg twice daily. When a dose of more than 500 mg/day is required, the dose may be divided and given twice daily\n【20】 - In elderly patients, debilitated or malnourished patients, and patients with impaired renal or hepatic function, the initial and maintenance dosing should be conservative to avoid hypoglycemic reactions\n【21】 # Off-Label Useand Dosage( Adult)\n【22】 # Guideline-Supported Use\n【23】 - There is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Tolazamide in adult patients\n【24】 # Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n【25】 - There is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Tolazamide in adult patients\n【26】 # Pediatric Indicationsand Dosage\n【27】 # FDA-Labeled Indicationsand Dosage( Pediatric)\n【28】 - There is limited information regarding FDA-Labeled Use of Tolazamide in pediatric patients\n【29】 # Off-Label Useand Dosage( Pediatric)\n【30】 # Guideline-Supported Use\n【31】 - There is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Tolazamide in pediatric patients\n【32】 # Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n【33】 - There is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Tolazamide in pediatric patients\n【34】 # Contraindications\n【35】 - Tolazamide is contraindicated in patients with:\n【36】 - Known hypersensitivity or allergy to the drug\n【37】 - Diabetic ketoacidosis, with or without coma. This condition should be treated with insulin\n【38】 - Type I diabetes, as sole therapy\n【39】 # Warnings\n【40】 - SPECIAL WARNING ON INCREASED RISK OF CARDIOVASCULAR MORTALITY\n【41】 - UGDP reported that patients treated for 5 to 8 years with diet plus a fixed dose of tolbutamide (1.5 grams per day) had a rate of cardiovascular mortality approximately 2 1/2 times that of patients treated with diet alone. - A significant increase in total mortality was not observed, but the use of tolbutamide was discontinued based on the increase in cardiovascular mortality, thus limiting the opportunity for the study to show an increase in overall mortality. Despite controversy regarding the interpretation of these results, the findings of the UGDP study provide an adequate basis for this warning. The patient should be informed of the potential risks and advantages of tolazamide and of alternative modes of therapy\n【42】 - Although only one drug in the sulfonylurea class (tolbutamide) was included in this study, it is prudent from a safety standpoint to consider that this warning may also apply to other oral hypoglycemic drugs in this class, in view of their close similarities in mode of action and chemical structure\n【43】 # Adverse Reactions\n【44】 # Clinical Trials Experience\n【45】 - There is limited information regarding Clinical Trial Experience of Tolazamide in the drug label\n【46】 ## Postmarketing Experience\n【47】 - Tolazamide ts have generally been well tolerated. In clinical studies in which more than 1,784 diabetic patients were specifically evaluated for incidence of side effects only 2.1% were discontinued from therapy because of side effects\n【48】 - Cholestatic jaundice may occur rarely; tolazamide ts should be discontinued if this occurs. Gastrointestinal disturbances, e.g., nausea, epigastric fullness, and heartburn, are the most common reactions and occurred in 1% of patients treated during clinical trials. They tend to be dose related and may disappear when dosage is reduced\n【49】 - Allergic skin reactions, e.g., pruritus, erythema, urticaria, and morbilliform or maculopapular eruptions, occurred in 0.4% of patients treated during clinical trials. These may be transient and may disappear despite continued use of tolazamide; if skin reactions persist, the drug should be discontinued\n【50】 - Porphyria cutanea tarda and photosensitivity reactions have been reported with sulfonylureas\n【51】 - Leukopenia, agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, and pancytopenia have been reported with sulfonylureas\n【52】 - Hepatic porphyria and disulfiram-like reactions have been reported with sulfonylureas; however, disulfiram-like reactions with tolazamide have been reported very rarely\n【53】 - Cases of hyponatremia have been reported with tolazamide and all other sulfonylureas, most often in patients who are on other medications or have medical conditions known to cause hyponatremia or increase release of antidiuretic hormone. The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) secretion has been reported with certain other sulfonylureas, and it has been suggested that these sulfonylureas may augment the peripheral (antidiuretic) action of ADH and/or increase release of ADH\n【54】 - Weakness, fatigue, dizziness, vertigo, malaise and headache were reported infrequently in patients treated during clinical trials. The relationship to therapy with tolazamide is difficult to assess\n【55】 # Drug Interactions\n【56】 - There is limited information regarding Tolazamide Drug Interactions in the drug label\n【57】 # Usein Specific Populations\n【58】 ### Pregnancy\n【59】 - Pregnancy Category (FDA): C\n【60】 - Tolazamide, administered to pregnant rats at 10 times the human dose, decreased litter size but did not produce teratogenic effects in the offspring. In rats treated at a daily dose of 14 mg/kg no reproductive aberrations or drug related fetal anomalies were noted. At an elevated dose of 100 mg/kg per day there was a reduction in the number of pups born and an increased perinatal mortality. There are, however, no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, tolazamide is not recommended for the treatment of the pregnant diabetic patient. Serious consideration should also be given to the possible hazards of the use of tolazamide in women of child bearing age and in those who might become pregnant while using the drug\n【61】 - Because recent information suggests that abnormal blood glucose levels during pregnancy are associated with a higher incidence of congenital abnormalities, many experts recommend that insulin be used during pregnancy to maintain blood glucose levels as close to normal as possible\n【62】 - Prolonged severe hypoglycemia (4 to 10 days) has been reported in neonates born to mothers who were receiving a sulfonylurea drug at the time of delivery. This has been reported more frequently with the use of agents with prolonged half-lives. If tolazamide is used during pregnancy, it should be discontinued at least 2 weeks before the expected delivery date\n【63】 - Pregnancy Category (AUS):\n【64】 - Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) Pregnancy Category\n【65】 - There is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Tolazamide in women who are pregnant\n【66】 ### Labor and Delivery\n【67】 - There is no FDA guidance on use of Tolazamide during labor and delivery\n【68】 ### Nursing Mothers\n【69】 - Although it is not known whether tolazamide is excreted in human milk, some sulfonylurea drugs are known to be excreted in human milk. Because the potential for hypoglycemia in nursing infants may exist, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. If the drug is discontinued and if diet alone is inadequate for controlling blood glucose, insulin therapy should be considered\n【70】 ### Pediatric Use\n【71】 - There is no FDA guidance on the use of Tolazamide with respect to pediatric patients\n【72】 ### Geriatic Use\n【73】 - Elderly patients are particularly susceptible to the hypoglycemic action of glucose-lowering drugs. Hypoglycemia may be difficult to recognize in the elderly. The initial and maintenance dosing should be conservative to avoid hypoglycemic reactions\n【74】 - Elderly patients are prone to develop renal insufficiency, which may put them at risk of hypoglycemia. Dose selection should include assessment of renal function\n【75】 ### Gender\n【76】 - There is no FDA guidance on the use of Tolazamide with respect to specific gender populations\n【77】 ### Race\n【78】 - There is no FDA guidance on the use of Tolazamide with respect to specific racial populations\n【79】 ### Renal Impairment\n【80】 - There is no FDA guidance on the use of Tolazamide in patients with renal impairment\n【81】 ### Hepatic Impairment\n【82】 - There is no FDA guidance on the use of Tolazamide in patients with hepatic impairment\n【83】 # Femalesof Reproductive Potentialand Males\n【84】 - There is no FDA guidance on the use of Tolazamide in women of reproductive potentials and males\n【85】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\n【86】 - There is no FDA guidance one the use of Tolazamide in patients who are immunocompromised\n【87】 # Administration and Monitoring\n【88】 ### Administration\n【89】 - Oral\n【90】 - Intravenous\n【91】 ### Monitoring\n【92】 - In addition to the usual monitoring of urinary glucose, the patient’s blood glucose must also be monitored periodically to determine the minimum effective dose for the patient; to detect primary failure, i.e., inadequate lowering of blood glucose at the maximum recommended dose of medication; and to detect secondary failure, i.e., loss of an adequate blood glucose-lowering response after an initial period of effectiveness\n【93】 # IV Compatibility\n【94】 - There is limited information regarding IV Compatibility of Tolazamide in the drug label\n【95】 # Overdosage\n【96】 - Overdosage of sulfonylureas, including tolazamide ts, can produce hypoglycemia\n【97】 - Mild hypoglycemic symptoms without loss of consciousness or neurologic findings should be treated aggressively with oral glucose and adjustment in drug dosage and/or meal patterns. Close monitoring should continue until the physician is assured that the patient is out of danger. Severe hypoglycemic reactions with coma, seizure, or other neurological impairment occur infrequently, but constitute medical emergencies requiring immediate hospitalization. If hypoglycemic coma is suspected or diagnosed, the patient should be given a rapid intravenous injection of concentrated (50%) glucose solution. This should be followed by a continuous infusion of a more dilute (10%) glucose solution at a rate which will maintain the blood glucose at a level above 100 mg/dL. Patients should be closely monitored for a minimum of 24 to 48 hours since hypoglycemia may recur after apparent clinical recovery\n【98】 # Pharmacology\n【99】 ## Mechanism of Action\n【100】 - Tolazamide appears to lower the blood glucose acutely by stimulating the release of insulin from the pancreas, an effect dependent upon functioning beta cells in the pancreatic islets. The mechanism by which tolazamide lowers blood glucose during long-term administration has not been clearly established. With chronic administration in type II diabetic patients, the blood glucose-lowering effect persists despite a gradual decline in the insulin secretory response to the drug. Extrapancreatic effects may be involved in the mechanism of action of oral sulfonylurea hypoglycemic drugs\n【101】 - Some patients who are initially responsive to oral hypoglycemic drugs, including tolazamide ts, may become unresponsive or poorly responsive over time. Alternatively, tolazamide ts may be effective in some patients who have become unresponsive to one or more other sulfonylurea drugs\n【102】 - In addition to its blood glucose-lowering actions, tolazamide produces a mild diuresis by enhancement of renal free water clearance\n【103】 ## Structure\n【104】 - Tolazamide is an oral blood-glucose-lowering drug of the sulfonylurea class. Tolazamide is a white or creamy-white powder very slightly soluble in water and slightly soluble in alcohol\n【105】 - The chemical name is 1-(Hexahydro-1H-azepin-1-yl)-3-(p-tolylsulfonyl)urea. Tolazamide has the following structural formula:\n【106】 - Each t for oral administration contains 250 mg or 500 mg of tolazamide, USP and the following inactive ingredients: colloidal silicon dioxide, croscarmellose sodium, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, and sodium lauryl sulfate\n【107】 ## Pharmacodynamics\n【108】 - There is limited information regarding Pharmacodynamics of Tolazamide in the drug label\n【109】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n【110】 - Tolazamide is rapidly and well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Peak serum concentrations occur at 3 to 4 hours following a single oral dose of the drug. The average biological half-life of the drug is 7 hours. The drug does not continue to accumulate in the blood after the first four to six doses are administered. A steady or equilibrium state is reached during which the peak and nadir values do not change from day to day after the fourth to sixth dose\n【111】 - Tolazamide is metabolized to five major metabolites ranging in hypoglycemic activity from 0% to 70%. They are excreted principally in the urine. Following a single oral dose of tritiated tolazamide, 85% of the dose was excreted in the urine and 7% in the feces over a five day period. Most of the urinary excretion of the drug occurred within the first 24 hours postadministration\n【112】 - When normal fasting non-diabetic subjects are given a single 500 mg dose of tolazamide orally, a hypoglycemic effect can be noted within 20 minutes after ingestion with a peak hypoglycemic effect occurring in 2 to 4 hours. Following a single oral dose of 500 mg tolazamide, a statistically significant hypoglycemic effect was demonstrated in fasted nondiabetic subjects 20 hours after administration. With fasting diabetic patients, the peak hypoglycemic effect occurs at 4 to 6 hours. The duration of maximal hypoglycemic effect in fed diabetic patients is about 10 hours, with the onset occurring at 4 to 6 hours and with the blood glucose levels beginning to rise at 14 to 16 hours. Single dose potency of tolazamide in normal subjects has been shown to be 6.7 times that of tolbutamide on a milligram basis. Clinical experience in diabetic patients has demonstrated tolazamide to be approximately 5 times more potent than tolbutamide on a milligram basis, and approximately equivalent in milligram potency to chlorpropamide\n【113】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\n【114】 - There is limited information regarding Nonclinical Toxicology of Tolazamide in the drug label\n【115】 # Clinical Studies\n【116】 - There is limited information regarding Clinical Studies of Tolazamide in the drug label\n【117】 # How Supplied\n【118】 - Tolazamide ts, USP are available containing either 250 mg or 500 mg of tolazamide, USP\n【119】 - The 250 mg ts are white to off-white, round, scored ts debossed with MYLAN above the score and 217 below the score on one side of the t and 250 on the other side.

Ehrlich had theorized that by screening many compounds a drug could be discovered with anti-microbial activity.  Ehrlich's team began their search for such a \"magic bullet\" among chemical derivatives of the dangerously-toxic drug atoxyl.  This was the first organized team effort to optimize the biological activity of a lead compound through systematic chemical modifications, the basis for nearly all modern pharmaceutical research\n【5】 - Arsphenamine was marketed under the trade name Salvarsan in 1910.  It was also called 606, because it was the 606th compound synthesized for testing. Salvarsan was the first organic anti-syphillitic, and a great improvement over the inorganic mercury compounds that had been used previously.  A more soluble (but slightly less effective) arsenical compound, Neosalvarsan, (neoarsphenamine), became available in 1912.  These arsenical compounds came with considerable risk of side effects, and they were supplanted as treatments for syphilis in the 1940s by penicillin\n【6】 - The bacterium that causes syphilis is a spirochete, Treponema pallidum. Arsphenamine is not toxic to spirochetes until it has been converted to an active form by the body, so the discovery of this drug could not have been made without Hata's animal testing\n【7】 - After leaving Erlich's laboratory, Hata continued parallel investigation of the new medicine in Japan\n【8】 # Structure\n【9】 - The structure was believed to feature an As=As bond, however, in 2005, it was shown to be a mixture of the cyclic trimer and a pentamer.

Although schistosomiasis is a tropical disease, travelers, students, immigrants, veterans, and tourists who previously lived in or visited regions where schistosomiasis is endemic, present worldwide. Early disease is usually asymptomatic, unless Katayama fever, an acute immune complex disease occurs. Late disease is symptomatic and includes hepatosplenic schistosomiasis (pre sinusoidal portal hypertension), urinary and urogenital schistosomiasis (urinary obstruction, genital symptoms), schistosomal glomerulopathy (chronic immune complex deposition in the kidney), and ectopic disease in areas such as the lungs and central nervous system (CNS). Diagnostic methods include visualization of Schistosoma eggs in formed stool, urine, and crushed biopsy tissues; serologic assays; and urinary antigen testing. Scarring patterns characteristic of hepatosplenic and urogenital disease may be seen on ultrasonography. Praziquantel is first-line treatment\n【3】 # Historical Perspective\n【4】 - Schistosomiasis is known as bilharzia or bilharziosis in many countries, after German physician Theodor Bilharz, who first described the cause of urinary schistosomiasis in 1851. The first doctor who described the entire disease cycle was Pirajá da Silva in 1908. It was a common cause of death for ancient Egyptians in the Greco-Roman period\n【5】 # Classification\n【6】 - Schistosomiasis may be classified based on the organ involvement into intestinal and urogenital schistosomiasis\n【7】 # Pathophysiology\n【8】 - The pathogenesis of acute human schistosomiasis is mainly related to egg deposition and liberation of antigens of adult worms and eggs. A strong inflammatory response characterized by high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukins 1, 6,  tumor necrosis factor-α, and by circulating immune complexes participates in the pathogenesis of the acute phase of the disease. Schistosomes have a typical trematode vertebrate-invertebrate lifecycle, with humans being the definitive host. The life cycles of all five human schistosomes are broadly similar. Infection can occur by penetration of the human skin by cercaria or following the handling of contaminated soil. Cercaria gets transformed into migrating schistosomulum stage in the skin. The incubation period for acute schistosomiasis is usually 14-84 days. Both the early and late manifestations of schistosomiasis are immunologically mediated. The major pathology of infection occurs with chronic schistosomiasis in which retention of eggs in the host tissues is associated with chronic granulomatous injury\n【9】 # Causes\n【10】 - Schistosomiasis is caused by Schistosoma. The major intestinal schistosomes include S.japonicum, S.mekongi, S.mansoni, S.intercalatum. The major urogenital schistosome is S.haematobium\n【11】 # Differentiating Schistosomiasisfrom Other Diseases\n【12】 - Schistosomiasis must be differentiated from tapeworm infections that cause abdominal pain, fever, chills, cough, and muscle aches such as like diphyllobothriasis, hymenolepiasis, and taeniasis\n【13】 # Epidemiology and Demographics\n【14】 - More than 600 million persons are exposed to Schistosoma parasites, 200 million persons are infected, and 20 million symptomatic cases of schistosomiasis are reported worldwide. All age groups are vulnerable to Schistosoma infection, but school-aged children and adolescents living in endemic areas tend to have the highest intensity of disease. There is no racial predilection to schistosomiasis. Schistosomiasis affects men and women equally\n【15】 # Risk Factors\n【16】 - The most potent risk factor in the development of schistosomiasis is skin exposure to contaminated fresh water (wading, swimming, washing, or working in fresh water that is infested with cercariae). Other risk factors include travel to endemic areas\n【17】 # Screening\n【18】 - Routine screening of travelers for schistosomiasis is not recommended. Screening is recommended only to guide mass public health treatment programs to targeted villages in endemic areas\n【19】 # Natural History, Complications and Prognosis\n【20】 - If left untreated, most of the patients with schistosomiasis may progress to develop ulceration or cancer of the bladder, liver or kidney failure. Common complications of schistosomiasis include hematuria, malnutrition, intestinal polyps, hydronephrosis, glomerulonephritis, bladder polyps, bladder cancer, infertility, ectopic pregnancy, renal failure, and cor-pulmonale. Depending on the extent of the disease progression at the time of diagnosis, the prognosis of schistosomiasis may vary. However, the prognosis is generally regarded as good with treatment\n【21】 # Diagnosis\n【22】 ## History and Symptoms\n【23】 - The majority of patients with schistosomiasis in early phase are asymptomatic, unless katayama fever, an acute immune complex disease, occurs. Late Schistosomiasis is symptomatic and includes hepatosplenic schistosomiasis (pre sinusoidal portal hypertension), urinary and urogenital schistosomiasis (urinary obstruction, genital symptoms), schistosomal glomerulopathy (chronic immune complex deposition in the kidney), and ectopic disease in areas such as the lungs and central nervous system (CNS)\n【24】 ## Physical Examination\n【25】 - Common physical examination findings of schistosomiasis include generalized lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, rash, fever, right upper quadrant tenderness, urticaria, bloody stool\n【26】 ## Laboratory Findings\n【27】 - Methods for diagnosing schistosomiasis include visualization of Schistosoma eggs in formed stool, urine, and crushed biopsy tissues; serologic assays; and urinary antigen testing. Laboratory findings consistent with the diagnosis of schistosomiasis include detection of circulating antibodies to schistosomes and schistosomal antigen in serum\n【28】 ## Electrocardiogram\n【29】 - There are no ECG findings associated with schistosomiasis\n【30】 ## X-ray\n【31】 - A chest x-ray may be helpful in the diagnosis of pulmonary schistosomiasis. Findings on a chest x-ray suggestive pulmonary schistosomiasis include patchy infiltrates, signs of increased vascular and interstitial marking and mild lymphadenopathy\n【32】 ## CT scan\n【33】 - Head, abdomen and lung CT may be helpful in the diagnosis of schistosomiasis. Findings include nodular and ring-enhancing lesions with surrounding edema in neuro-schistosomiasis, calcified capsules in hepatosplenic schistosomiasis and interstitial fibrosis in pulmonary schistosomiasis\n【34】 # MRI\n【35】 - There are no MRI findings associated with schistosomiasis\n【36】 ## Ultrasound\n【37】 - Ultrasound may be helpful in the diagnosis of urogenital and intestinal schistosomiasis. Findings on an ultrasound suggestive of urogenital schistosomiasis include scarring patterns of bladder wall. Findings on an ultrasound suggestive of intestinal schistosomiasis (periportal fibrosis) include multiple echogenic areas, each with central echo lucency\n【38】 ## Other imaging findings\n【39】 - There are no other imaging findings associated with schistosomiasis\n【40】 ## Other diagnostic studies\n【41】 - There are no other diagnostic studies associated with schistosomiasis\n【42】 # Treatment\n【43】 ## Medical Therapy\n【44】 - The mainstay of treatment for schistosomiasis is pharmacotherapy. Praziquantel is the drug of choice in treating schistosomiasis. Corticosteroids should be administered in addition to praziquantel in patients with symptoms due to neuro-schistosomiasis and patients with severe katayama fever. The goals of treatment of schistosomiasis are to eradicate the helminth and correct any sequelae of infection. While praziquantel is safe and highly effective in curing an infected patient, it does not prevent re-infection by cercariae and is thus not an optimum treatment for people living in endemic areas\n【45】 ## Surgery\n【46】 - Surgical intervention is not usually recommended for the management of schistosomiasis but may be indicated to treat associated complications. Surgery does not treat or eradicate Schistosoma infection. Surgical options include portacaval shunting, ligations of esophageal varices, and surgical removal of genitourinary granulomatous masses\n【47】 ## Primary Prevention\n【48】 - Effective measures for the primary prevention of schistosomiasis include avoiding swimming or wading in freshwater that may be infested with cercariae, water used for bathing should be brought to a rolling boil for 1 minute to kill any cercariae, and then cooled before bathing to avoid scalding. Vigorous towel drying after an accidental water exposure may help to prevent the Schistosoma parasite from penetrating the skin\n【49】 ## Secondary Prevention\n【50】 - Secondary preventive measures of schistosomiasis are similar to primary preventive measures", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-15 17:51:29", "update_time": "2024-04-15 21:43:30"}

Calcium fluoride (CaF2) occurs naturally in the ground water in certain areas of the world. When water is artificially fluoridated, sodium fluoride (NaF), sodium silicofluoride (SFS) or fluosilicic acid (FSA) is added to raise the fluoride level to a range between .7 and 1.2 parts per million (ppm)\n【2】 - Despite the current stance of the medical and dental research associations, opponents charge that releasing fluoride compounds into municipal water supplies infringes on individual choice as to what a person ingests. They say water fluoridation is a scheme to dispose of industrial waste and this amounts to a mass dissemination of toxic substances\n【3】 - Advocates of water fluoridation say that fluoridation is similar to fortifying salt with iodine, milk with vitamin D and orange juice with vitamin C and say it is an effective way to prevent tooth decay and improve oral health over a lifetime, for both children and adults. Opponents counter that there is no U.S. RDA (recommended dietary allowance) for fluoride  and claim industrial fluorosilicates are serious neurotoxic and mutagenic health hazards, even at the 1 part per million level deemed \"optimal\" by pro-fluoridation groups. The EPA Headquarters Union of Scientists say recent, peer-reviewed studies that document bone fractures, pediatric osteosarcoma, genetic mutations, lowered IQ, decreased kidney, thyroid and pineal gland functions, arthritis, osteoporosis and dental fluorosis requires an immediate halt to using the nation's drinking water reservoirs as toxic waste disposal sites\n【4】 # Sodium fluoride and fluorosilicic acid\n【5】 - Webster's dictionary defines sodium fluoride as:\n【6】 - sodium+fluoride\n【7】 - Function: noun\n【8】 - Sodium fluoride is also one of the main ingredients in fungicides, rat and possum poison (sodium fluoroacetate, also known as \"1080\") and Sarin nerve gas (isopropyl-methyl-phosphoryl-fluoride)\n【9】 - The Material Data Safety Sheet (MSDS) for sodium fluoride (NaF) warns:\n【10】 - : Hazards Identification:\n【11】 - DEVELOPMENTAL TOXICITY: The substance may be toxic to kidneys, lungs, the nervous system, heart, gastrointestinal tract, cardiovascular system, bones, teeth. Repeated or prolonged exposure to the substance can produce target organs damage. Repeated exposure to a highly toxic material may produce general deterioration of health by an accumulation in one or many human organs\n【12】 - Over 90% of the fluoride compounds added to water are fluorosilicic acid (FSA) or sodium fluorosilicate (SFS), which are industrial byproducts of fluorine gas concentrates that are captured in pollution scrubbers during the manufacture of phosphate fertilizer. The phosphate ores used to make fertilizer are a natural source of radiation. During the manufacturing process, trace amounts of heavy metals, including lead, arsenic, mercury and radioactive nuclides such as uranium and radium are captured in the pollution scrubber and carried into the fluorosilicic acid concentrate. The radionuclides radon-222 and polonium-210 readily combine with fluorine, which is the most reactive element. As little as 0.03 microcuries (6.8 trillionths of a gram) of polonium-210 can be carcinogenic to humans. In addition, lead is absorbed like calcium in the body, where it can be stored in the bones for years before decaying and triggering a release of alpha radiation. Unless tests for specific isotopes are performed, no one would know that a transmutation had occurred from lead-214 to bismuth-214 and then to the highly radioactive polonium-214. Despite pro-fluoridation group's claims that fluorosilicic acid is comparable to a \"vitamin\" or \"nutrient\", the manufacturer's data sheet describes FSA as a DOT Class 6.1 Poisonous/Toxic substance, subject to hazmat regulations, with a maximum content of .020% heavy metals (as lead, or 1 part in 5000). In contrast, the EPA has a zero-level goal for lead in drinking water, with a new MCL (maximum contaminant level) of five parts per billion\n【13】 # EPAemployeeandcitizenopposition\n【14】 - In 2005, eleven EPA employee unions representing over 7000 environmental and public health professionals of the Civil Service called for a moratorium on drinking water fluoridation programs across the country and asked EPA management to recognize fluoride as posing a serious risk of causing cancer in people. The unions acted following revelations of an apparent cover-up of evidence from Harvard School of Dental Medicine linking fluoridation with an elevated risk of osteosarcoma in boys, a rare but fatal bone cancer\n【15】 - In addition, over 1000 health industry professionals, including doctors, dentists, scientists and researchers from a variety of disciplines are calling for an end to water fluoridation in an online petition to Congress\n【16】 - Their petition highlights eight recent events that they say mandates a moratorium on water fluoridation, including a 500-page review of fluoride’s toxicology that was published in 2006 by a distinguished panel appointed by the National Research Council of the National Academies.  While the NRC report did not specifically examine artificially fluoridated water, it concluded that the US Environmental Protection Agency's safe drinking water standard of 4 parts per million (ppm) for fluoride is unsafe and should be lowered. Despite over 60 years of fluoridation without a single double-blind study of fluoride's effectiveness and many basic research questions that have never been addressed, the panel reviewed a large body of literature in which fluoride has a statistically significant association with a wide range of adverse effects\n【17】 - Several prominent dental researchers and government advisors who were leaders of the pro-fluoridation movement have announced reversals of their former positions after they concluded that water fluoridation is not an effective means of reducing dental caries and that it poses serious risks to human health. The late Dr. John Colquhoun was Principal Dental Officer of Auckland, New Zealand. In an article titled, \"Why I changed my mind about water fluoridation\", he published his reasons for changing sides\n【18】 - Dr. Hardy Limeback, BSc, PhD, DDS was one of the 12 scientists who served on the National Academy of Sciences panel that issued the aforementioned report, Fluoride in Drinking Water: A Scientific Review of the EPA's Standards. Dr. Limeback is an associate professor of dentistry and head of the preventive dentistry program at the University of Toronto. He detailed his concerns in an April 2000 letter titled, \"Why I am now officially opposed to adding fluoride to drinking water\"\n【19】 - In a presentation to the California Assembly Committee of Environmental Safety and Toxic Materials, Dr. Richard Foulkes, B.A., M.D., former special consultant to the Minister of Health of British Columbia, revealed:\n【20】 \"The  studies that were presented to me were selected and showed only positive results. Studies that were in existence at that time that did not fit the concept that they were \"selling,\" were either omitted or declared to be \"bad science.\" The endorsements had been won by coercion and the self-interest of professional elites. Some of the basic \"facts\" presented to me were, I found out later, of dubious validity. We are brought up to respect these persons in whom we have placed our trust to safeguard the public interest. It is difficult for each of us to accept that these may be misplaced.\"\n【21】 - Despite various concerns by private citizens, government agencies such as the CDC and WHO continue to support water fluoridation as being a safe and effective means of reducing dental decay\n【22】 # Role in oral health\n【23】 - There are some groups which consider fluoride neither a vitamin nor an essential nutrient and claim that is the same belief held by the medical community.  Fluoridation opponents believe that excellent dental health can be maintained through alternative methods, such as modifying diet by consuming less sugar, chewing xylitol gum as is done in Europe, and good dental hygiene through flossing and brushing the teeth - even with fluoride toothpaste. They argue that since the effects of fluoride is primarily topical, there is no need to actually consume fluoride.  Furthermore, the benefits of fluoridated water do not outweigh the costs of systemic harm on the body. Consequently, they argue that there is no need to fluoridate the community drinking water\n【24】 - Despite these claims, dental research has shown that fluoride has a positive effect on dental health.  During tooth development, fluoride binds to the hydroxyapatite crystals present in enamel and makes the enamel more resistant to demineralization by acids.  As a result, some organizations, such as the American Dental Hygiene Association, classify fluoride as a nutrient necessary for proper tooth development.  In addition, organizations, including the CDC and WHO, promote increasing the accessibility of fluoridated water\n【25】 # Use throughout the world\n【26】 - Water Fluoridation is prevalent in the United States.  Most developed nations previously fluoridated their water, but stopped or banned the practice.   Some examples are as follows.  The years when water Fluoridation started and stopped are in parentheses:\n【27】 - German Federal Republic\n【28】 - Sweden\n【29】 - Netherlands\n【30】 - Czechoslovakia\n【31】 - German Democratic Republic\n【32】 - Soviet Union\n【33】 - Finland\n【34】 - Japan\n【35】 - In spite of this, the prevalence of dental decay has decreased in both Western Europe and the United States.  Some countries had water fluoridation but then abruptly stopped the practice. These countries, including the former East Germany, Cuba, and Finland, have continued to see drops in the incidence of tooth decay. Based on this evidence, opponents conclude that water fluoridation is unnecessary\n【36】 - Though water fluoridation is promoted by many health organizations and is considered the least costly method of dispersing fluoride, other methods of dispersal are possible. In areas with complex water sources, water fluoridation is more difficult and more costly. Thus, other methods to fluoride are supported in those cases. The World Health Organization is currently assessing the effects of affordable fluoridated toothpaste, milk fluoridation and salt fluoridation in Africa, Asia, and Europe\n【37】 - Moreover, a major concern of health organizations is the incidence of dental fluorosis, a sign of overexposure to fluoride. In many instances, natural fluoride levels in water are much higher than desired. These areas do not need fluoride added to water supplies, and health organizations endorse providing alternate water sources or adjusting the fluoride levels to deliver the proper amount for dental health instead\n【38】 # Effectiveness\n【39】 - Frequently, opponents point to a study by the National Institute of Dental Research showing little difference in tooth decay rates among children in fluoridated and non-fluoridated communities.  In the study's results, the difference between the children exposed to water fluoridation, and those who were not exposed, was very small, between 0.12 and 0.30 DMFS (Decayed Missing and Filled Surfaces)\n【40】 - Opponents also argue that in the instances that fluoride prevents tooth decay, the effects are merely topical.  Therefore, fluoridating water is unnecessary and ineffective.  Instead, they argue, direct applications of fluoride to teeth as done in dental offices and with fluoridated toothpastes should be the recommended methods\n【41】 - Opponents point out that dental decay continues to exist in water fluoridated communities.  They reason that if fluoride is effective, then there would be no more tooth decay.  While, in theory, the poorest members of society would be aided the most by fluoridinated water, baby bottle tooth decay (BBTD) and tooth decay in general is still prevalent in those social groups.  Opponents conclude that, in light of the continuing dental health problem, water fluoridation is unable to successfully increase health standards and thus should not be used\n【42】 - Finally, opponents argue that the general decline of tooth decay is the result of factors beside water fluoridation, including toothpaste with fluoride, improved diets, and overall improved general and dental health\n【43】 - The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published in its Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) that starting or continuing water fluoridation decreased the incidence of tooth decay by 29%, and that stopping water fluoridation increased the incidence of tooth decay in some communities.  Other organizations also see a clear link between desired fluoride levels in water and a decrease in tooth decay\n【44】 - In addition, since oral health is affected by many factors, fluoride alone would be unable, nor would it be expected, to eradicate the disease.  The social groups that would be more likely to benefit from water fluoridation are those living in poorer conditions, and an important factor to decrease dental health disparities may be water fluoridation programs.  Nonetheless, it is understood that these communities suffer from various problems which would impede oral health, such as lack of access to dental care and poorer oral hygiene education.  Water fluoridation is only a single factor to improve dental health\n【45】 # Safety\n【46】 - There are some opponents of fluoridation who believe fluoride is a poison that can lead to death or, more commonly, dental fluorosis in instances of overdose.  They argue that having a lethal chemical in the water is reckless and leads to many health problems in the general public\n【47】 - These persons point to research which they say supports the notion that fluoride causes chromosomal damage and interferes with DNA repair.  They point to animal studies that they say demonstrate that rats fed for one year with 1 ppm fluoride in their water had detrimental changes to their kidneys and brains, an increased uptake of aluminum in the brain, and the formation of beta amyloid deposits, a characteristic of Alzheimers disease.  In animal studies, fluoride has been shown to inhibit melatonin production and promote precocious puberty.    Fluoride may have an analogous inhibitory effect on human melatonin production, as fluoride accumulates readily in the human pineal gland, the brain organ responsible for melatonin synthesis.   Further, it is argued by some opponents that fluoride can weaken the immune system, leaving people vulnerable to the development of cancer and AIDS\n【48】 - Theses groups further emphasize that an overdose of fluoride is associated with liver damage, kidney function, and fluorosis in children.  At high doses, fluoride has many side effects.  Animal studies demonstrate that fluoride can damage the male reproductive system in various species.  Consequently, fluoride is considered dangerous by these groups\n【49】 - Advocates of water fluoridation agree that fluoride in high concentrations produces harmful effects to the body.  Nonetheless, they argue that almost any substance is harmful because toxicity is based on the amount of exposure.  In defending water fluoridation, the American Dental Association points out that vitamin A, vitamin D, iron, iodine, aspirin, and water are potentially harmful if given in certain amounts.  As is true for all vitamins and minerals, recommended dosages for fluoride represent levels which maximize health benefits and minimize adverse effects\n【50】 - The greatest concern with fluoride overexposure is dental fluorosis.  Fluorosis is undesirable because, in severe cases, it discolors teeth, causes surface changes to the enamel, and makes oral hygiene more difficult.  Government agencies, such as the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, keep records on the prevalence of fluorosis in the general public.  Also a concern, skeletal fluorosis is a disease in which fluoride deposits into bone, causing joint stiffness, joint pain, and sometimes changes in bone shape.  For skeletal fluorosis to occur, chronic, high level exposure to fluoride is required.  A mild form of skeletal fluorosis, osteosclerosis, is seen when levels of fluoride reach 5 parts per million (ppm) and the time of exposure lasts for 10 years\n【51】 - In order to best prevent fluorosis, health organizations have created guidelines restricting the amount of fluoride exposure.  The United States Environmental Protection Agency limits the maximum amount of fluoride in drinking water to 4.0 milligrams per liter of water and recommends water supplies to contain between 0.7 and 1.2 milligrams of fluoride per liter.  The World Health Organization cautions that fluoride levels above 1.5 milligrams per liter leaves the risk for fluorosis.  When fluoride levels in water are low (usually below 0.6 ppm), fluoride supplements are sometimes prescribed to encourage healthy dental development.  There are accepted recommended guidelines on the amount of fluoride to prescribe, which depend on the fluoride levels in the drinking water and on the age of the child\n【52】 - Moreover, health organizations have affirmed the currently accepted belief that recommended levels of fluoride does not contribute to the many diseases water fluoridation detractors accuse fluoride of causing.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Cancer Institute have both issued statements that water fluoridation is not believed to cause osteosarcomas.  Cancer in general is not believed to be caused from water fluoridation\n【53】 - There is no clear link between Alzheimer's disease and water fluoridation.  A study in 1998 suggested a possible relationship between fluoride exposure and Alzheimer's disease.  Research groups point out that the study contained methodological limitations, which prevent a definitive conclusion on the subject. As a result, research and health agencies currently believe fluoride is not a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, and instead age and family history are the most important risk factors.  Moreover, there is some research that suggests Alzheimer's disease can be prevented with water fluoridation because of the competition between aluminum and fluoride absorption.  Nonetheless, this research is also limited by design and no definitive conclusion of this effect can be made\n【54】 - Other health concerns, such as kidney disease, Down syndrome, lead poisoning, heart disease, decreased fertility rates, and inhibition of biologic enzymes, are not believed to be attributed to water fluoridation\n【55】 # Reliance on experts\n【56】 - Many fluoridation opponents rely on experts opposing water fluoridation to validate their argument of the dangers of fluoride.  People, such as scientists and Nobel prize winners, are exemplified as a large knowledgeable group that have stated their opposition against water fluoridation\n【57】 - In response, scientific and health organizations criticize opponents of water fluoridation for trying to engage in \"polling practices\" with research.  When a group opposing water fluoridation claims an award-winning researcher or dental expert agrees with them, the argument is supposed to be more convincing to the general public.  Researchers emphasize that voting or polling is not how scientific progress is made.  Thorough review of methodology and design of multiple studies over time lead researchers to conclusions.  Even in the critical analysis of these studies, content is the focus, rather than the researcher who led the study\n【58】 # Ethics\n【59】 - One aspect of opposition to water fluoridation regards the social or political implications of adding fluoride to public water supplies.  Setting aside the claim that water fluoridation may improve dental health, such an act would violate an individual's choice to pursue free choice of, or form of, medical treatment and it is argued that water fluoridation is \"compulsory mass medication\" because it does not allow proper consent\n【60】 - It is also argued that, because of the negative health effects of fluoride exposure, mandatory fluoridation of public water supplies is a \"breach of ethics\" and a \"human rights violation.\"  Litigation, both pro and con, has been a frequent outcome of forced water fluoridation\n【61】 - Many advocates of fluoridation do not consider it a violation of people's right to consent to medical treatment.  They usually argue that fluoridation is not a form of mass medication because fluoride is naturally present in all water systems.  Opponents argue that the form of fluoride found in naturally fluoridated water supplies is not the same as the form used to artificially fluoridate water.  Likewise, opponents argue that the pharmacy grade fluoride used in many studies to support fluoride as a tooth decay preventative is not the grade used to fluoridate water. Frequently, those who promote water fluoridation make the comparison to the fortification of other types of foods, such as adding vitamins to breakfast cereals and baby foods\n【62】 - In addition, proponents propose that preventing broad, easy access to fluoride is unethical.  Since the populations which benefit most from water fluoridation are children and those in poorer communities, fluoridation is considered an avenue to relieve some of the health disparities between socio-economic groups.  Fluoridation is defended further by its relative low cost.  The Canadian Task Force On Preventive Health Care describes water fluoridation as \"the single most effective, equiand efficient means of preventing coronal and root dental caries.\"  In the United States, the cost can be as low as 31 cents per person, per year.  As a result, many health organizations defend fluoridation and do not consider it a violation of ethical principles\n【63】 # Government and industry conspiracy\n【64】 - Some opponents point to a government conspiracy that has modified scientific research to further its own political goal. The particular conspiracy involves the secret development of the atomic bomb during World War II. The argument usually involves characterizing research as flawed or edited for the public in order to avoid public concern over military research. As some have put it, \"The science of fluoridating public drinking water systems has been, from day one, shoddy at best , , the basis of that science was rooted in protecting the U.S. Atomic bomb program from litigation.\"\n【65】 - Other conspiracy theories involve large industrial companies wanting to rid themselves of fluorine \"waste products\". Some argue that fluoride is a waste product that is unusable and expensive to dispose of properly. Because of this expense, industrial companies desiring to protect their profits release \"millions of tons of waste fluoride into the environment.\" As a result, these opponents of water fluoridation say, \"it is now clear that the one utterly relentless force behind fluoridation is American 'big industry' \"\n【66】 - In spite of this, a large majority of government agencies and medical organizations support water fluoridation in locations needing fluoride supplementation and agree that it is a safe practice.    The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has listed water fluoridation as one of the ten greatest achievements in public health of the 20th century. In 2000, a report by the Surgeon General of the United States titled \"Oral Health in America\" stated, \"Community water fluoridation remains one of the great achievements of public health in the twentieth century.\"  Various international groups, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Association for Dental Research (IADR) support water fluoridation as a safe and effective method to fight tooth decay\n【67】 # Court cases\n【68】 ## United States\n【69】 - Fluoridation has spawned many court cases. Anti-fluoride activists have sued municipalities, claiming that their rights to consent to medical treatment, privacy, and due process are infringed by mandatory water fluoridation.  Individuals have sued municipalities for a number of illnesses that they blamed on fluoridation of the city's water supply. A substantial majority of courts have held in favor of cities in such cases, finding no or only a tenuous connection between health problems and widespread water fluoridation.  To date, no federal appellate court or state court of last resort (i.e., state supreme court) has found water fluoridation to be unlawful\n【70】 ### Early cases\n【71】 - A flurry of cases were heard in numerous state courts in the 1950s during the early years of water fluoridation.  State courts consistently held in favor of allowing fluoridation to continue, analogizing fluoridation to mandatory vaccination and the use of other chemicals to clean the public water supply, both of which had a long-standing history of acceptance by courts\n【72】 - In 1952, a Federal Regulation was adopted that stated in part, \"The Federal Security Agency will regard water supplies containing fluorine, within the limitations recommended\n【73】 - by the Public Health Service, as not actionable under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.\"\n【74】 - The Supreme Court of Oklahoma analogized water fluoridation to mandatory vaccination in a 1954 case. The court noted, \"we think the weight of well-reasoned modern precedent sustains the right of municipalities to adopt such reasonable and undiscriminating measures to improve their water supplies as are necessary to protect and improve the public health, even though no epidemic is imminent and no contagious disease or virus is directly involved , , To us it seems ridiculous and of no consequence in considering the public health phase of the case that the substance to be added to the water may be classed as a mineral rather than a drug, antiseptic or germ killer; just as it is of little, if any, consequence whether fluoridation accomplishes its beneficial result to the public health by killing germs in the water, or by hardening the teeth or building up immunity in them to the bacteria that causes caries or tooth decay. If the latter, there can be no distinction on principle between it and compulsory vaccination or inoculation, which, for many years, has been well-established as a valid exercise of police power.\"\n【75】 - In the 1955 case Froncek v. City of Milwaukee, the Wisconsin Supreme Court affirmed the ruling of a circuit court which held that \"the fluoridation is not the practice of medicine, dentistry, or pharmacy, by the City\" and that \"the legislation is a public health measure, bearing a real, substantial, and reasonable relation to the health of the city.\"\n【76】 - The Supreme Court of Ohio, in 1955's Kraus v. City of Cleveland, said, \"Plaintiff's argument that fluoridation constitutes mass medication, the unlawful practice of medicine and adulteration may be answered as a whole. Clearly, the addition of fluorides to the water supply does not violate such principles any more than the chlorination of water, which has been held valid many times.\"\n【77】 ### Fluoridation consensus\n【78】 - As cases continued to be brought in state courts, a general consensus developed that fluoridation, at least from a legal standpoint, was accep  In 1973's Beck v. City Council of Beverly Hills, the California Court of Appeal, Second District, said, \"Courts through the United States have uniformly held that fluoridation of water is a reasonable and proper exercise of the police power in the interest of public health. The matter is no longer an open question.\" (citations omitted)\n【79】 ### Contemporary challenges\n【80】 - Though courts have consistently rejected arguments against fluoridation, advocates continue to challenge the spread of fluoridation.  For instance, in 2002, the city of Watsonville, California chose to disregard a California law mandating fluoridation of water systems with 10,000 or more hookups, and the dispute between the city and the state ended up in court.  The trial court and the intermediate appellate court ruled in favor of the state and its fluoridation mandate, however, and the Supreme Court of California declined to hear the case in February of 2006.  Since 2000, courts in Washington, Maryland, and Texas have reached similar conclusions\n【81】 ## Republic of Ireland\n【82】 - In Ryan v. Attorney General , the Supreme Court held that water fluoridation did not infringe the plaintiff's right to bodily integrity. However, the court found that such a right to bodily integrity did exist, despite the fact that it was not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution of Ireland, thus establishing the doctrine of unenumerated rights in Irish constitutional law\n【83】 # Medical approval\n【84】 - Although Japan, Germany, Sweden, Netherlands, Czechoslovakia, Cuba, and the former Soviet Union have stopped water fluoridation, and some repuscientific organizations oppose water fluoridation, more than 100 national and international health service agencies and professional organizations see benefits in community water fluoridation as a means of preventing dental decay. They include:\n【85】 - American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry\n【86】 - American Association of Public Health Dentistry\n【87】 - American Dental Hygienists Association\n【88】 - American Dental Association\n【89】 - American Public Health Association\n【90】 - Australian Dental Association\n【91】 - British Dental Association\n【92】 - British Medical Association\n【93】 - Canadian Dental Association\n【94】 - Canadian Dental Hygienists Association\n【95】 - Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\n【96】 - European Academy of Paediatric Dentistry\n【97】 - FDI World Dental Federation\n【98】 - International Association for Dental Research\n【99】 - National Cancer Institute\n【100】 - National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research\n【101】 - World Health Organization\n【102】 # Science reviews\n【103】 - There has only been one proper systematic review ever carried out\n【104】 - In the United Kingdom the Department of Health funded a systematic review in 1999, which looked at all of the evidence so far published, into the efficacy safety of adding fluoride to drinking water. This work was carried out at the University of York. They concluded:\n【105】 - The report was checked by the Medical Research Council (UK) after publication\n【106】 - The current confused state can be better understood by the discovery of the  House of Commons Health Committee'  inquiry into 'The Influence of the Pharmaceutical Industry'  that medical students are seldom taught, neither here nor abroad,  how to properly go about evaluating  a research paper.  The committee  concluded: “This implies a major deficiency in the education of healthcare professionals.”\n【107】 # Characteristic errors\n【108】 - We are concerned about the continuing misinterpretations of the evidence and think it is important that decision makers are aware of what the review really found. As such, we urge interested parties to read the review conclusions in full at:\n【109】 - Occurrences of argumentum ad verecundiam and argumentum ad populum were not recognised for what they were\n【110】 # The precautionary principle\n【111】 - In order to fully prove and understand the nature of fluoridation risks (including the range of doses that can cause the effects, and how these doses vary based on environmental, genetic, and dietary factors) more research is required. But is it ethical to continue exposing entire populations to fluoride in their water while additional long-term studies are carried out to clarify the risks?\n【112】 - That is the crux of the question posed by an insightful analysis published in the March 2006 issue of the Journal of Evidence Based Dental Practice. The analysis, written by Joel Tickner and Melissa Coffin, examines the water fluoridation controversy in the context of the “precautionary principle.” The precautionary principle has become a core guiding principle of environmental health regulations in Europe and is based on the notion that:\n【113】 \"if there is uncertainty, yet credible scientific evidence or concern of threats to health, precautionary measures should be taken. In other words, preventive action should be taken on early warnings even though the nature and magnitude of the risk are not fully understood.\"\n【114】 - Without expressing any personal opinions about water fluoridation, Tickner and Coffin note that “The need for precaution arises because the costs of inaction in the face of uncertainty can be high, and paid at the expense of sound public health.”\n【115】 - In determining whether the precautionary principle should be applied to fluoridation, the authors note that:\n【116】 - There are other ways of delivering fluoride besides the water supply;\n【117】 - Fluoride does not need to be swallowed to prevent tooth decay;\n【118】 - Tooth decay has dropped at the same rate in countries with, and without, water fluoridation;\n【119】 - People are now receiving fluoride from many other sources besides the water supply;\n【120】 - Studies indicate fluoride’s potential to cause a wide range of adverse, systemic effects;\n【121】 - Since fluoridation affects so many people, “one might accept a lower level of proof before taking preventive actions.”\n【122】 - In Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb, General Jack D. Ripper states that fluoridation is a communist plot: \"Do you realize that fluoridation is the most monstrously conceived and dangerous Communist plot we have ever had to face?\"\n【123】 - In the Justice League Unlimited episode \"Question Authority\", the Question, a conspiracy obsessed vigilante, is being tortured for information when he claims that fluoridation does not in fact prevent tooth decay, but does render one's teeth visible by spy satellite", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": "语义不完整#27#34#括号内是水氟化开始和停止的年份:并没有看见括号内容", "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-15 17:51:29", "update_time": "2024-04-15 21:36:00"}

This guidance applies to clinical investigations conducted under 21 CFR Part 312 (Investigational New Drug Applications or IND regulations). It describes how to complete the Statement of Investigator form (Form FDA 1572)\n【3】 # I. GENERAL\n【4】 ## 1. What is the Statement of Investigator, Form FDA 1572?\n【5】 - The Statement of Investigator, Form FDA 1572 , is an agreement signed by the investigator to provide certain information to the sponsor and assure that he/she will comply with FDA regulations related to the conduct of a clinical investigation of an investigational drug or biologic. The most recent version of the 1572 is available online at\n【6】 ## 2. Why does this form need to be completed by an investigator?\n【7】 - The 1572 has two purposes:\n【8】 1 to provide the sponsor with information about the investigator’s qualifications and the clinical site that will enable the sponsor to establish and document that the investigator is qualified and the site is an appropriate location at which to conduct the clinical investigation\n【9】 2 to inform the investigator of his/her obligations and obtain the investigator’s commitment to follow pertinent FDA regulations. Investigators should complete the form as accurately as they can. Investigators should be aware that making a willfully false statement is a criminal offense under 18 U.S.C. 1001. Further, submission of a deliberately false statement to the sponsor or to the agency can be taken into consideration in a disqualification proceeding\n【10】 ## 3. When must this form be completed and signed by an investigator?\n【11】 - Whenever a sponsor selects a new investigator to participate in a clinical investigation that is being conducted under an investigational new drug application (IND), the sponsor must obtain a completed and signed 1572 before permitting the investigator to begin participation in the clinical investigation (21 CFR 312.53(c)). The investigator should sign the form only after being given enough information to be informed about the clinical investigation and to understand the commitments described in #9 of the 1572. Having enough information about the study typically means that the investigator has received copies of, has read, and understands the protocol and investigator’s brochure (if required), and is familiar with the regulations governing the conduct of clinical studies. The investigator’s signature on this form constitutes the investigator’s affirmation that he or she is qualified to conduct the clinical investigation and constitutes the investigator’s written commitment to abide by FDA regulations in the conduct of the clinical investigation\n【12】 ## 4. Must the investigator be a physician?\n【13】 - The regulations do not require that the investigator be a physician. Sponsors are required to select only investigators qualified by training and experience as appropriate experts to investigate the drug (21 CFR 312.53(a)). In the event the clinical investigator is a nonphysician, a qualified physician (or dentist, when appropriate) should be listed as a subinvestigator for the trial and should be responsible for all trial-related medical ,or\n【14】 - dental decisions. (ICH E6 section 4.3.1; )\n【15】 ## 5. What are the minimum qualifications of an investigator?\n【16】 - As stated in #4, the regulations require that sponsors select investigators who are qualified by training and experience as appropriate experts to investigate the drug. The regulations do not specify the minimum requirements nor do the regulations specify what qualifications an investigator must have in order to be considered qualified by training and experience to conduct a clinical investigation. Sponsors have discretion in determining what qualifications, training, and experience will be needed, based on the general recognition that this would include familiarity with human subject protection (HSP) regulations (i.e., 21 CFR Parts 50 and 56) and practices as well as good clinical practice (GCP) regulations  and standards (e.g., ICH E6) for the conduct of clinical studies\n【17】 ## 6. Does the 1572 need to be submitted to FDA?\n【18】 - No. Although the sponsor is required to collect the 1572 from the investigator, FDA does not require the form to be submitted to the agency. Many sponsors submit the 1572 to FDA, however, because it collects, in one place, information that must be submitted to FDA under 21 CFR 312.23(a)(iii)(b)\n【19】 ## 7. When must a 1572 be updated or a new 1572 completed and signed by an investigator to reflect new or changed information?\n【20】 - There are two instances when it is necessary for an investigator to complete and sign a new 1572: when an investigator is participating in a new protocol that has been added to the IND and when a new investigator is added to the study (21 CFR 312.53(c)). If there are other changes to information contained on a signed and dated 1572 (e.g., an IRB address change, the addition of new subinvestigators, the addition of a clinical research lab), the investigator should document the changes in the clinical study records and inform the sponsor of these changes, so that the sponsor can appropriately update the IND. The 1572 itself does not need to be revised and a new 1572 need not be completed and signed by the investigator. The sponsor can accumulate certain changes and submit this information to the IND in, for example, an information amendment or a protocol amendment\n【21】 ## 8. If a clinical investigation is not conducted under an IND or is for a medical device, must investigators sign a 1572?\n【22】 - No. Under the regulations, a 1572 is only required for studies of investigational drugs and biologics conducted under an IND. It is not required for studies that are not done under an IND, and is not applicable to investigational device studies. Sponsors of device studies must obtain a signed investigator agreement (containing information similar to that requested on the 1572) from each participating investigator, per 21 CFR 812.43(c)\n【23】 ## 9. Must a sponsor conduct a foreign clinical study under an IND?\n【24】 - No. A sponsor may choose, but is not required, to conduct a foreign clinical study under an IND. When a foreign clinical study is conducted under an IND, all FDA IND requirements must be met unless waived . When the foreign clinical study is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor must ensure that this study complies with 21 CFR 312.120, “Foreign clinical studies not conducted under an IND,” if the sponsor intends to submit the study to FDA to support clinical investigations conducted in the United States and/or marketing approval. An application based solely on foreign clinical data must meet criteria listed in 21 CFR 314.106\n【25】 ## 10. Must investigators who conduct studies outside of the United States sign a 1572?\n【26】 - If a foreign clinical study is conducted under an IND, then all FDA IND regulations, including the requirement to obtain a signed 1572, must be met. If a clinical study is conducted outside of the U.S. and is not conducted under an IND, then the investigator need not sign a 1572. If local laws or regulations prohibit the signing of a 1572, FDA would expect the sites to operate as non-IND sites and the study conducted as a non-IND study. If the study data is to be submitted to support a marketing application (e.g., a new drug application (NDA)), the study must be conducted in compliance with 21 CFR 312.120\n【27】 ## 11. If a foreign clinical study is being conducted under an IND, what are the investigator’s responsibilities with respect to local laws and regulations?\n【28】 - Investigators are responsible for complying with the applicable laws and regulations of the country in which the study is being conducted, regardless of whether the study is being conducted under an IND. We recommend that sponsors obtain signed, written statements from investigators acknowledging their commitment to comply with local laws and requirements. In addition, if a foreign clinical study is being conducted under an IND, the investigator must sign Form FDA 1572 (investigator statement) and ensure that the study is conducted in accordance with the investigator statement and all other applicable regulations under 21 CFR Part 312\n【29】 ## 12. For foreign clinical studies conducted under an IND, how can an investigator sign the 1572 when the investigator knows he/she cannot commit to all of the requirements on the form, specifically IRB membership (21 CFR 56.107)?\n【30】 - IRB review and approval is required before a clinical study can be initiated under an IND (21 CFR 56.103(a)). FDA may waive any of the IRB requirements for specific research activities or for classes of research activities otherwise covered by the IRB regulations (21 CFR 56.105), but FDA uses the waiver provision only when alternative mechanisms for ensuring protection of the rights and welfare of human subjects are accep The most common circumstance for which FDA receives a waiver request is when a sponsor wishes to conduct a foreign clinical study under an IND. In this case, typically an\n【31】 - Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) that operates in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) is utilized instead of a U.S. IRB. Although its membership and functions for assuring human subject protection are comparable to an IRB, an IEC may not meet all of the IRB requirements contained in 21 CFR Part 56. For a foreign study, an IRB waiver request should contain a description of alternative mechanisms for assuring human subject protection. It would generally be accepfor a waiver request to state the intention to use an IEC that complies with GCP (e.g., ICH E6) instead of an IRB that complies with 21 CFR Part 56. The sponsor should submit the waiver request to the IND under which the study will be conducted. The IND will have been submitted to the appropriate review division in either the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) or the Center for Biologics\n【32】 - Evaluation and Research (CBER). The sponsor will be informed by the agency in writing whether the waiver request is denied or granted. If a waiver is granted, the sponsor should have investigators attach a copy of the letter granting the waiver to the signed 1572 in the investigator’s record\n【33】 ## 13. If a sponsor chooses to conduct a foreign clinical study (or operate non-US sites in a multinational study) under an IND and the investigators at these non-US sites comply with the ICH E6 Good Clinical Practice Consolidated Guidance, would the non-US investigators also be in compliance with FDA’s IND requirements under 21 CFR Part 312?\n【34】 - Yes, with two exceptions. The first is that the FDA requirements for IRBs under 21 CFR Part 56 are slightly different with respect to membership and function. To address this issue, as described in #12 above, FDA can provide a specific waiver from the Part 56 IRB requirements, allowing an IEC that complies with good clinical practice to substitute for the IRB.4 The second exception is that the requirements for informed consent under 21\n【35】 - CFR Part 50 for particular clinical trials (e.g., emergency research under 21 CFR 50.24, clinical investigations involving pediatric subjects under Subpart D) are more extensive with respect to IRB responsibilities. Because these types of trials are uncommon, our experience has not revealed that this has caused a conflict; but in the event of one, we would be willing to discuss a resolution with the sponsor on a case-by-case basis. If the investigator or sponsor believes that there are other conflicting requirements, the sponsor may request a waiver from FDA from the specific requirement under 21 CFR 312.10\n【36】 ## 14. Must foreign clinical study sites in a multinational study that includes domestic sites be conducted under an IND?\n【37】 - No. A multinational study may include domestic sites under the IND and foreign sites not under the IND. Investigational drug and biologics studies conducted in the U.S. must be conducted in compliance with the IND requirements contained in 21 CFR 312, which includes the requirement that investigators sign the 1572. If a study also involves foreign clinical sites, the sponsor may choose, but is not required, to include the foreign clinical sites under the IND. The investigators from the U.S. sites and any foreign sites included under the IND would be required to sign the 1572. The investigators from the foreign sites that are not included under the IND are not required to sign the 1572. If the sponsor chooses to conduct a multinational study with U.S. and some foreign sites under the IND, and other foreign sites not under the IND, the sponsor can submit a single protocol to the IND and all sites would follow this protocol. Alternatively, the sponsor can conduct a multinational study with one protocol for sites under the IND (U.S. sites and some foreign sites) and a different protocol(s) for foreign sites not under the IND. If the intent is to pool the data from U.S. and foreign sites, the protocols would ordinarily be very similar or identical. The U.S. sites and any foreign sites included under the IND must follow the protocol that was submitted to the IND. For foreign sites that are not included under the IND, the protocol(s) does not need to be submitted to the IND. In general, if the sponsor intends to submit the data in an application for marketing approval, we recommend that the sponsor identify the foreign sites that will not be conducted under the IND and discuss plans to pool the data from U.S. and foreign sites with the appropriate FDA review division. Note, however, that 21 CFR 312.32(b) requires sponsors to promptly review information about the safety of the investigational drug obtained or otherwise received by the sponsor from any source, foreign or domestic. Under 21 CFR 312.32(c), sponsors must also notify FDA and all participating investigators in an IND safety report of any adverse experience associated with the use of the drug that is both serious and unexpected. This means that FDA and all participating investigators under the IND would be informed of such an adverse experience, even if it occurred in a foreign study not conducted under the IND\n【38】 ## 15. How does a sponsor submit information to FDA about a foreign clinical study that was not conducted under an IND?\n【39】 - Under 21 CFR 312.120, the sponsor can submit information to FDA from a foreign\n【40】 - clinical study that was not conducted under an IND to support clinical investigations in\n【41】 - the United States and/or marketing approval. When submitting information about a\n【42】 - foreign clinical study, it is helpful to clearly identify in the cover letter that the material is\n【43】 - being submitted in accordance with 21 CFR 312.120. The submission requirements for\n【44】 - supporting documentation can be found at 21 CFR 312.120(b)\n【45】 ===16. Should a new form be prepared and signed when the OMB expiration date is\n【46】 - reached?===\n【47】 - No. There is no need to prepare and sign a new 1572 when the OMB expiration date has\n【48】 - been reached\n【49】 ===17. Does FDA expect a double-sided 1572, or is a two-page document printed from the\n【50】 - FDA website accep?===\n【51】 - Either is accep; however, FDA recommends that a two-page document be stapled so\n【52】 - that there is no question about what form the investigator signed\n【53】 ## 18. How should the 1572 be completed?\n【54】 - The 1572 on FDA’s website may be completed by typing the information directly into the\n【55】 - fillable form and printing the completed form. Alternatively, it is accepto print the\n【56】 - blank form from FDA’s website and hand-write or type the information onto the form\n【57】 - Typed forms are preferable because they are usually more legible. The completed form\n【58】 - must be signed and dated by the investigator (either by hand or using an accep- electronic method)\n【59】 ## 19. How should an investigator’s name appear on the 1572?\n【60】 - #1 should contain the investigator’s full legal name ,e.g., name on the\n【61】 - investigator’s birth certificate or marriage certificate. Titles, degrees, and/or\n【62】 - professional qualifications may follow the investigator’s legal name, if desired\n【63】 ## 20. What address should be entered into #1?\n【64】 - The address where the investigator can be reached by mail or in person should be entered\n【65】 - in #1 of the 1572. Usually, this corresponds to the investigator’s work or\n【66】 - business address\n【67】 ===21. Should co-investigators be listed on the 1572 in #1? Is it accepto have\n【68】 - more than one investigator at a single site?===\n【69】 - The term co-investigator is not defined in FDA regulations. As commonly used, the term\n【70】 - is meant to indicate that each co-investigator is fully responsible for fulfilling all of the\n【71】 - bligations of an investigator as identified in 21 CFR 312.60. Thus under 21 CFR\n【72】 312.3(b), each co-investigator is an investigator, and as such must sign a separate 1572\n【73】 - In some situations, it is preferable to have more than one investigator responsible for a\n【74】 - clinical investigation. For example, when a study is conducted at multiple research\n【75】 - facilities that are not in close proximity, FDA expects an investigator who has signed a\n【76】 # QUALIFY THE INVESTIGATOR AS AN EXPERT IN THE CLINICAL INVESTIGATION\n【77】 ## 22. What is the purpose of #2?\n【78】 - #2 requires the investigator to attach a curriculum vitae (CV) or other statement\n【79】 - f qualifications, showing the education, training and experience that qualifies the\n【80】 - investigator as an expert in the clinical investigation of the drug/biologic for the use\n【81】 - under investigation. Information identified in this section and attached to the 1572\n【82】 - enables the sponsor to assess an investigator's qualifications\n【83】 ===23. Does the CV or other statement of qualifications need to be updated during a\n【84】 - clinical study?===\n【85】 - No. FDA regulations do not require a CV or other statement of qualifications to be\n【86】 - updated during a clinical study\n【87】 ## 24. Are CVs required to be signed and dated?\n【88】 - No. FDA regulations do not require a CV to be signed and dated. The investigator's\n【89】 - dated signature on the 1572 is sufficient to attest to the accuracy of the CV or other\n【90】 - statement of qualifications submitted with the 1572\n【91】 ==IV. SECTION #3: NAME AND ADDRESS OF ANY MEDICAL SCHOOL,\n【92】 - HOSPITAL,  OTHER RESEARCH FACILITY WHERE THE CLINICAL\n【93】 - INVESTIGATION(S) WILL BE CONDUCTED==\n【94】 ===25. What address(es) should be entered in #3?\n【95】 - The address(es) of the location(s) where the investigation will be conducted and to where\n【96】 - the test articles will be shipped, if different from the investigator's address of record,\n【97】 - should be entered in #3\n【98】 ## 26. What qualifies as a research facility for #3?\n【99】 - #3 is intended to identify facilities where study activities will be conducted and clinical data will be generated or collected. This includes facilities where subjects will be\n【100】 - seen and study procedures performed. For example, this might include locations such as\n【101】 - health care facilities where the test article will be administered, or where physical exams\n【102】 - will be performed. Facilities where other important clinical investigation functions are\n【103】 - performed may also be identified in #3. For example, a research laboratory\n【104】 - where the test article is prepared, a special storage facility where the test article will be\n【105】 - kept, or a location where tissue specimens are collected should be listed in this section\n【106】 ===27. If an investigator sees study subjects at more than one site, should the investigator\n【107】 - list all sites on the 1572?===\n【108】 - Yes. The names and addresses of each of the study sites should be identified in  However, if the protocol specifies that the investigative product can be administered\n【109】 - at a subject’s home ,for example, the protocol allows for daily injections to be\n【110】 - administered by a registered nurse in the subject’s home, the subjects' home addresses\n【111】 - do not have to be listed on the 1572. Study records should reflect that the test article was\n【112】 - administered at subjects' homes per the protocol\n【113】 ==V. SECTION #4: NAME AND ADDRESS OF CLINICAL LABORATORY\n【114】 - FACILITIES TO BE USED IN THIS STUDY==\n【115】 28. What qualifies as a clinical laboratory facility for #4?\n【116】 - #4 is intended to identify clinical laboratories or testing facilities directly\n【117】 - contributing to or supporting the clinical study ,for example, diagnostic labs performing\n【118】 - blood work, imaging centers, cardiology labs, etc.. This may include analytical labs that\n【119】 - provide pharmacokinetic analysis, and laboratories supplying efficacy data for clinical\n【120】 - investigations conducted under an IND\n【121】 29. If a laboratory is sending samples to satellite or other contract labs for additional\n【122】 - testing, should these labs be identified in #4?\n【123】 - It is only necessary to list the primary laboratory, provided that laboratory can trace the\n【124】 - samples to each of the satellite and/or contract labs where the tests were performed\n【125】 - VI. SECTION #5: NAME AND ADDRESS OF THE INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW\n【126】 - BOARD (IRB) RESPONSIBLE FOR THE REVIEW AND APPROVAL OF THE\n【127】 - STUDY(IES)\n【128】 - Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n【129】 30. Does the IRB reviewing and approving the clinical study have to be at the same\n【130】 - location as where the research is conducted?\n【131】 - The regulations permit review of research by IRBs at locations other than where the\n【132】 - research is being performed ,e.g. independent or non-institutional IRB; use of a\n【133】 - cooperative IRB review process; see 21 CFR 56.114. Therefore an IRB may review\n【134】 - clinical studies that are not performed on-site as long as requirements in 21 CFR Parts 50\n【135】 - and 56 are met. For more information on cooperative research arrangements, see the\n【136】 - FDA Guidance for Industry-Using a Centralized IRB Review Process in Multicenter\n【137】 - Clinical Trials ()\n【138】 - VII. SECTION #6: NAMES OF THE SUBINVESTIGATORS WHO WILL BE\n【139】 - ASSISTING THE INVESTIGATOR IN THE CONDUCT OF THE\n【140】 - INVESTIGATION(S)\n【141】 31. Who should be listed as a subinvestigator in #6?\n【142】 - FDA's regulation at 21 CFR 312.3(b) states: \"In the event an investigation is conducted\n【143】 - by a team of individuals, the investigator is the responsible leader of the team\n【144】 ‘Subinvestigator’ includes any other individual member of that team.\" 21 CFR\n【145】 312.53(c)(viii) requires the investigator to provide \"a list of the names of the\n【146】 - subinvestigators (e.g., research fellows, residents) who will be assisting the investigator\n【147】 - in the conduct of the investigation(s).\"\n【148】 - The purpose of #6 is to capture information about individuals who, as part of an\n【149】 - investigative team, will assist the investigator and make a direct and significant\n【150】 - contribution to the data. The decision to list an individual in #6 depends on\n【151】 - his/her level of responsibility ,i.e., whether he/she is performing significant clinical\n【152】 - investigation-related duties. In general, if an individual is directly involved in the\n【153】 - performance of procedures required by the protocol, and the collection of data, that\n【154】 - person should be listed on the 1572. For example, if the protocol notes that each subject\n【155】 - needs to visit a specified internist who will perform a full physical to qualify subjects for\n【156】 - the clinical investigation, that internist should be listed in #6\n【157】 32. Should research nurses, other nurses, residents, fellows, office staff, or other\n【158】 - hospital staff be listed in #6?\n【159】 - Hospital staff, including nurses, residents, or fellows and office staff who provide\n【160】 - ancillary or intermittent care but who do not make a direct and significant contribution to\n【161】 - the clinical data, do not need to be listed individually. It is not necessary to include in\n【162】 - this section a person with only an occasional role in the conduct of the research, e.g., an\n【163】 - n-call physician who temporarily dealt with a possible adverse effect or a temporary\n【164】 - substitute for any research staff\n【165】 - ances/\n【166】 - Concerning staff residents on rotation, it may be difficult to prospectively identify those\n【167】 - individuals who might perform specified protocol procedures or collect clinical data\n【168】 - Specific names of the rotational staff do not have to be listed in #6. Instead, to\n【169】 - successfully address this scenario, the names of rotational individuals and the procedures\n【170】 - they are expected to perform should be included in the clinical study records. This\n【171】 - information should also be sent to the sponsor for submission to FDA in, for example, an\n【172】 - information amendment\n【173】 33. Should pharmacists or research coordinators be listed in #6?\n【174】 - The decision about whether to list a pharmacist or research coordinator on the 1572 is a\n【175】 - matter of judgment, dependent upon the contribution that the individual makes to the\n【176】 - study. For example, a research pharmacist may prepare test articles and maintain drug\n【177】 - accountability for many clinical studies that are ongoing concurrently at an institution\n【178】 - Because the pharmacist would not be making a direct and significant contribution to the\n【179】 - data for a particular study, it would not be necessary to list the pharmacist as a\n【180】 - subinvestigator in #6, but he/she should be listed in the investigator’s study\n【181】 - records\n【182】 - Generally, a research coordinator has a greater role in performing critical study functions\n【183】 - and making direct and significant contributions to the data. For example, a research\n【184】 - coordinator often recruits subjects, collects and evaluates study data, and maintains study\n【185】 - records. Therefore, the research coordinator should usually be listed in #6 of the\n【186】 34. Is a statement of qualifications required for subinvestigators?\n【187】 - No. The regulations at 21 CFR 312.53(c)(viii) require only that subinvestigators’\n【188】 - names be listed in #6 of the 1572. It is the responsibility of the sponsor to select\n【189】 - investigators qualified by training and experience, as appropriate experts, to investigate\n【190】 - the drug. The investigator must ensure that all associates, colleagues, and employees\n【191】 - assisting with the conduct of the clinical investigation are aware of their obligations\n【192】 - including complying with the IND regulations\n【193】 35. Do individuals who are listed in #6 on the 1572 have to submit information\n【194】 - about their financial interests?\n【195】 - Yes. Under 21 CFR Part 54 (Disclosure of Financial Interests by Clinical Investigators),\n【196】 - a person listed or identified as an investigator or subinvestigator who is directly involved\n【197】 - in the treatment or evaluation of research subjects must submit financial disclosure\n【198】 - information to the sponsor. For purposes of this financial disclosure regulation, the term\n【199】 - investigator also includes the spouse and each dependent child of the investigator and subinvestigator. (21 CFR 54.2(d) and 54.4). For additional information about financial\n【200】 - subinvestigator. (21 CFR 54.2(d) and 54.4). For additional information about financial\n【201】 - Investigators ()\n【202】 - VIII. SECTION #7: NAME AND CODE NUMBER, IF ANY, OF THE\n【203】 - PROTOCOL(S) IN THE IND FOR STUDY(IES) TO BE CONDUCTED BY THE\n【204】 - INVESTIGATOR\n【205】 36. What information should be included in this section?\n【206】 - List the name and code number (if any) of all the protocols under the IND that will be\n【207】 - conducted by the investigator signing the 1572. A code number is an identifying number\n【208】 - assigned by the sponsor\n【209】 - As a reminder, some investigators may be responsible for submitting certain clinical trial\n【210】 - information to the National Institutes of Health clinical trials data bank under 42 U.S.C\n【211】 282(j), 402(j) of the Public Health Service Act. Although not all investigators will be\n【212】 - expected to meet this requirement, go to  for further information\n【213】 - about potential responsibilities\n【214】 - IX. SECTION #8: CLINICAL PROTOCOL INFORMATION\n【215】 37. How should #8 be completed for a phase 4 study?\n【216】 - Phase 4 refers to the timing of a clinical study (i.e., postmarketing) rather than the\n【217】 - characteristics of the study, which are described under 21 CFR 312.21, Phases of an\n【218】 - investigation. A postmarketing clinical trial would meet the description of a phase 2 or 3\n【219】 - investigation and a full protocol would be submitted. The investigator does not need to\n【220】 - mark either of the boxes in #8, but should identify in #7 that the study is\n【221】 - a phase 4 study\n【222】 38. Can an investigator submit the study protocol instead of an outline of the study\n【223】 - protocol?\n【224】 - Yes. The protocol or a detailed description is required for any phase 2 or 3 clinical trial\n【225】 - Phase 1 studies can be supported by an outline", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": "多余换行#0#225#全文存在多处多余换行", "type3": "", "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-15 17:51:29", "update_time": "2024-04-15 23:09:06"}

Common adverse reactions include hypersensitivity\n【5】 # Adult Indicationsand Dosage\n【6】 # FDA-Labeled Indicationsand Dosage( Adult)\n【7】 - Fluorescein injection, USP 10% is indicated in diagnostic fluorescein angiography or angioscopy of the retina and iris vasculature\n【8】 - The normal adult dose of fluorescein injection, USP 10% is 500 mg (100 mg/mL) via intravenous administration\n【9】 - For children, the dose should be calculated on the basis of 35 mg for each ten pounds of body weight (7.7 mg/kg body weight)\n【10】 - Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Do not mix or dilute with other solutions or drugs. Flush intravenous cannulas before and after drugs are injected to avoid physical incompatibility reactions\n【11】 - Inject the dose rapidly (1 mL per second is normally recommended) into the antecubital vein, after taking precautions to avoid extravasation. A syringe, filled with fluorescein injection, USP 10%, may be attached to transparent tubing and a 23 gauge butterfly needle for injection. Insert the needle and draw the patient's blood to the hub of the syringe so that a small air bubble separates the patient's blood in the tubing from the fluorescein. With the room lights on, slowly inject the blood back into the vein while watching the skin over the needle tip. If the needle has extravasated, the patient's blood will be seen to bulge the skin and the injection should be stopped before any fluorescein is injected. When assured that extravasation has not occurred, the room light may be turned off and the fluorescein injection completed. Luminescence usually appears in the retina and choroidal vessels in 7 to 14 seconds and can be observed by standard viewing equipment\n【12】 - Reduction in dose from 5 ml to 2 ml of fluorescein injection, USP 10% may be appropriate in cases when a highly sensitive imaging system e.g., scanning laser ophthalmoscope is used\n【13】 # Off-Label Useand Dosage( Adult)\n【14】 # Guideline-Supported Use\n【15】 - There is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Fluorescein (injection) in adult patients\n【16】 # Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n【17】 - There is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Fluorescein (injection) in adult patients\n【18】 # Pediatric Indicationsand Dosage\n【19】 # FDA-Labeled Indicationsand Dosage( Pediatric)\n【20】 - There is limited information regarding FDA-Labeled Use of Fluorescein (injection) in pediatric patients\n【21】 # Off-Label Useand Dosage( Pediatric)\n【22】 # Guideline-Supported Use\n【23】 - There is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Fluorescein (injection) in pediatric patients\n【24】 # Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n【25】 - There is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Fluorescein (injection) in pediatric patients\n【26】 # Contraindications\n【27】 - FLUORESCITE (fluorescein injection, USP) 10% is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to fluorescein sodium or any other ingredients in this product\n【28】 # Warnings\n【29】 - Care must be taken to avoid extravasation during injection as the high pH of fluorescein solution can result in severe local tissue damage. The following complications resulting from extravasation of fluorescein have been noted to occur: Sloughing of the skin, superficial phlebitis, subcutaneous granuloma, and toxic neuritis along the median curve in the antecubital area. Complications resulting from extravasation can cause severe pain in the arm for up to several hours. When significant extravasation occurs, the injection should be discontinued and conservative measures to treat damaged tissue and to relieve pain should be implemented. Rare cases of death due to anaphylaxis have been reported\n【30】 # Adverse Reactions\n【31】 # Clinical Trials Experience\n【32】 - Nausea, vomiting, gastrointestinal distress, headache, syncope, hypotension, and symptoms and signs of hypersensitivity have occurred. Cardiac arrest, basilar artery ischemia, severe shock, convulsions, thrombophlebitis at the injection site, and rare cases of death have been reported\n【33】 - Extravasation of the solution at the injection site causes intense pain at the site and a dull aching pain in the injected arm. Generalized hives and itching, bronchospasm and anaphylaxis have been reported. A strong taste may develop after injection\n【34】 ## Postmarketing Experience\n【35】 - There is limited information regarding Postmarketing Experience of Fluorescein (injection) in the drug label\n【36】 # Drug Interactions\n【37】 - There is limited information regarding Fluorescein (injection) Drug Interactions in the drug label\n【38】 # Usein Specific Populations\n【39】 ### Pregnancy\n【40】 - Pregnancy Category (FDA): C\n【41】 - Adequate animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with fluorescein sodium.

If you suspect drug poisoning or overdose, please contact the National Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) immediately\n【74】 # Pharmacology\n【75】 ## Mechanism of Action\n【76】 - Fluorescein sodium responds to electromagnetic radiation and light between the wavelengths of 465-490 nm and fluoresces, i.e., emits light at wavelengths of 520-530 nm. Thus, the hydrocarbon is excited by blue light and emits light that appears yellowish-green. Following intravenous injection of fluorescein sodium in an aqueous solution, the unbound fraction of the fluorescein can be excited with a blue light flash from a fundus camera as it circulates through the ocular vasculature, and the yellowish green fluorescence of the dye is captured by the camera. In the fundus, the fluorescence of the dye demarcates the retinal and/or choroidal vasculature under observation, distinguishing it from adjacent areas/structures\n【77】 ## Structure\n【78】 ## Pharmacodynamics\n【79】 - There is limited information regarding Pharmacodynamics of Fluorescein (injection) in the drug label\n【80】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n【81】 - Within 7 to 14 seconds after IV administration into antecubital vein, fluorescein usually appears in the central artery of the eye. Within a few minutes of IV administration of fluorescein sodium, a yellowish discoloration of the skin occurs, which begins to fade after 6 to 12 hours of dosing. Various estimates of volume of distribution indicate that fluorescein distributes well into interstitial space (0.5 L/kg)\n【82】 - Fluorescein undergoes rapid metabolism to fluorescein monoglucuronide. After IV administration of fluorescein sodium (14 mg/kg) to 7 healthy subjects, approximately 80% of fluorescein in plasma was converted to glucuronide conjugate after a period of 1 hour post dose, indicating relatively rapid conjugation\n【83】 - Fluorescein and its metabolites are mainly eliminated via renal excretion. After IV administration, the urine remains slightly fluorescent for 24 to 36 hours. A renal clearance of 1.75 mL/min/kg and a hepatic clearance (due to conjugation) of 1.50 mL/min/kg have been estimated. The systemic clearance of fluorescein was essentially complete by 48 to 72 hours after administration of 500 mg fluorescein\n【84】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\n【85】 - There is limited information regarding Nonclinical Toxicology of Fluorescein (injection) in the drug label\n【86】 # Clinical Studies\n【87】 - There is limited information regarding Clinical Studies of Fluorescein (injection) in the drug label\n【88】 # How Supplied\n【89】 - FLUORESCITE (fluorescein injection, USP) 10% is supplied in a single-use 5 mL glass vial with a gray FluroTec coated chlorobutyl (latex free) stopper and purple flip-off aluminum seal.

There is a Black Warning for this drug as shown here.  Common adverse reactions include Seizures, PRCA, allergy\n【6】 # Adult Indicationsand Dosage\n【7】 # FDA-Labeled Indicationsand Dosage( Adult)\n【8】 - Darbepoetin alfa is indicated for the treatment of anemia due to chronic kidney disease (CKD), including patients on dialysis and patients not on dialysis\n【9】 - Darbepoetin alfa is indicated for the treatment of anemia in patients with non-myeloid malignancies where anemia is due to the effect of concomitant myelosuppressive chemotherapy, and upon initiation, there is a minimum of two additional months of planned chemotherapy\n【10】 - Darbepoetin alfa has not been shown to improve quality of life, fatigue, or patient well-being\n【11】 - Darbepoetin alfa is not indicated for use:\n【12】 - In patients with cancer receiving hormonal agents, biologic products, or radiotherapy, unless also receiving concomitant myelosuppressive chemotherapy\n【13】 - In patients with cancer receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy when the anticipated outcome is cure\n【14】 - As a substitute for RBC transfusions in patients who require immediate correction of anemia\n【15】 - Evaluate the iron status in all patients before and during treatment and maintain iron repletion. Correct or exclude other causes of anemia (e.g., vitamin deficiency, metabolic or chronic inflammatory conditions,bleeding, etc.) before initiating darbepoetin alfa\n【16】 - In controlled trials, patients experienced greater risks for death, serious adverse cardiovascular reactions, and stroke when administered erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) to target a hemoglobin level of greater than 11 g/dL. No trial has identified a hemoglobin target level, darbepoetin alfa dose, or dosing strategy that does not increase these risks. Individualize dosing and use the lowest dose of darbepoetin alfa sufficient to reduce the need for RBC transfusions\n【17】 - Physicians and patients should weigh the possible benefits of decreasing transfusions against the increased risks of death and other serious cardiovascular adverse events\n【18】 - For all patients with CKD\n【19】 - When initiating or adjusting therapy, monitor hemoglobin levels at least weekly until s, then monitor at least monthly. When adjusting therapy consider hemoglobin rate of rise, rate of decline, ESA responsiveness and hemoglobin variability. A single hemoglobin excursion may not require a dosing change\n【20】 - Do not increase the dose more frequently than once every 4 weeks. Decreases in dose can occur more frequently. Avoid frequent dose adjustments\n【21】 - If the hemoglobin rises rapidly (e.g., more than 1 g/dL in any 2-week period), reduce the dose of darbepoetin alfa by 25% or more as needed to reduce rapid responses\n【22】 - For patients who do not respond adequately, if the hemoglobin has not increased by more than 1 g/dL after 4 weeks of therapy, increase the dose by 25%\n【23】 - For patients who do not respond adequately over a 12-week escalation period, increasing the darbepoetin alfa dose further is unlikely to improve response and may increase risks. Use the lowest dose that will maintain a hemoglobin level sufficient to reduce the need for RBC transfusions. Evaluate other causes of anemia. Discontinue darbepoetin alfa if responsiveness does not improve\n【24】 - For patients with CKD on dialysis:\n【25】 - Initiate darbepoetin alfa treatment when the hemoglobin level is less than 10 g/dL\n【26】 - If the hemoglobin level approaches or exceeds 11 g/dL, reduce or interrupt the dose of darbepoetin alfa\n【27】 - The recommended starting dose is 0.45 mcg/kg intravenously or subcutaneously as a weekly injection or 0.75 mcg/kg once every 2 weeks as appropriate. The intravenous route is recommended for patients on hemodialysis\n【28】 - For patients with CKD not on dialysis:\n【29】 - Consider initiating darbepoetin alfa treatment only when the hemoglobin level is less than 10 g/dL and the following considerations apply:\n【30】 - The rate of hemoglobin decline indicates the likelihood of requiring a RBC transfusion and,\n【31】 - Reducing the risk of alloimmunization and/or other RBC transfusion-related risks is a goal\n【32】 - If the hemoglobin level exceeds 10 g/dL, reduce or interrupt the dose of darbepoetin alfa, and use the lowest dose of darbepoetin alfa sufficient to reduce the need for RBC transfusions\n【33】 - The recommended starting dose is 0.45 mcg/kg body weight intravenously or subcutaneously given once at four week intervals as appropriate\n【34】 - Conversion from Epoetin alfa to darbepoetin alfa in patients with CKD on dialysis\n【35】 - Darbepoetin alfa is administered less frequently than epoetin alfa\n【36】 - Administer darbepoetin alfa once weekly in patients who were receiving epoetin alfa 2 to 3 times weekly\n【37】 - Administer darbepoetin alfa once every 2 weeks in patients who were receiving epoetin alfa once weekly\n【38】 - Estimate the starting weekly dose of darbepoetin alfa for adults and pediatric patients on the basis of the weekly epoetin alfa dose at the time of substitution . Maintain the route of administration (intravenous or subcutaneous injection)\n【39】 - Conversion from Epoetin alfa to darbepoetin alfa in patients with CKD not on dialysis\n【40】 - The dose conversion depicted in  does not accurately estimate the once monthly dose of darbepoetin alfa\n【41】 - Initiate darbepoetin alfa in patients on cancer chemotherapy only if the hemoglobin is less than 10 g/dL, and if there is a minimum of two additional months of planned chemotherapy\n【42】 - Use the lowest dose of darbepoetin alfa necessary to avoid RBC transfusions\n【43】 - The recommended starting dose and schedules are:\n【44】 2.25 mcg/kg every week subcutaneously until completion of a chemotherapy course\n【45】 500 mcg every 3 weeks subcutaneously until completion of a chemotherapy course\n【46】 - The needle cover of the prefilled syringe contains dry natural rubber (a derivative of latex), which may cause allergic reactions\n【47】 - Do not shake. Do not use darbepoetin alfa that has been shaken or frozen\n【48】 - Protect vials and prefilled syringes from light\n【49】 - Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Do not use any vials or prefilled syringes exhibiting particulate matter or discoloration\n【50】 - Discard unused portion of darbepoetin alfa in vials or prefilled syringes. Do not re-enter vial\n【51】 - Do not dilute darbepoetin alfa and do not administer in conjunction with other drug solutions\n【52】 # Off-Label Useand Dosage( Adult)\n【53】 # Guideline-Supported Use\n【54】 - There is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Darbepoetin alfa in adult patients\n【55】 # Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n【56】 - There is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Darbepoetin alfa in adult patients\n【57】 # Pediatric Indicationsand Dosage\n【58】 # FDA-Labeled Indicationsand Dosage( Pediatric)\n【59】 - There is limited information regarding FDA-Labeled Use of Darbepoetin alfa in pediatric patients\n【60】 # Off-Label Useand Dosage( Pediatric)\n【61】 # Guideline-Supported Use\n【62】 - There is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Darbepoetin alfa in pediatric patients\n【63】 # Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n【64】 - There is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Darbepoetin alfa in pediatric patients\n【65】 # Contraindications\n【66】 - Darbepoetin alfa is contraindicated in patients with:\n【67】 - Uncontrolled hypertension\n【68】 - Pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) that begins after treatment with darbepoetin alfa or other erythropoietin protein drugs\n【69】 - Serious allergic reactions to darbepoetin alfa\n【70】 # Warnings\n【71】 - In controlled clinical trials of patients with CKD comparing higher hemoglobin targets (13 - 14 g/dL) to lower targets (9 - 11.3 g/dL), darbepoetin alfa and other ESAs increased the risk of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, congestive heart failure, thrombosis of hemodialysis vascular access, and other thromboembolic events in the higher target groups\n【72】 - Using darbepoetin alfa to target a hemoglobin level of greater than 11 g/dL increases the risk of serious adverse cardiovascular reactions and has not been shown to provide additional benefit\n【73】 - Use caution in patients with coexistent cardiovascular disease and stroke\n【74】 - Patients with CKD and an insufficient hemoglobin response to ESA therapy may be at even greater risk for cardiovascular reactions and mortality than other patients. A rate of hemoglobin rise of greater than 1 g/dL over 2 weeks may contribute to these risks\n【75】 - In controlled clinical trials of patients with cancer, darbepoetin alfa and other ESAs increased the risks for death and serious adverse cardiovascular reactions. These adverse reactions included myocardial infarction and stroke\n【76】 - In controlled clinical trials, ESAs increased the risk of death in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) and the risk of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in patients undergoing orthopedic procedures\n【77】 - The design and overall results of the 3 large trials comparing higher and lower hemoglobin targets are shown in\n【78】 - Normal Hematocrit Study (NHS)\n【79】 - A prospective, randomized, open-label study of 1265 patients with chronic kidney disease on dialysis with documented evidence of congestive heart failure or ischemic heart disease was designed to test the hypothesis that a higher target hematocrit (Hct) would result in improved outcomes compared with a lower target Hct. In this study, patients were randomized to epoetin alfa treatment targeted to a maintenance hemoglobin of either 14 ± 1 g/dL or 10 ± 1 g/dL. The trial was terminated early with adverse safety findings of higher mortality in the high hematocrit target group\n【80】 - Higher mortality (35% vs. 29%) was observed for the patients randomized to a target hemoglobin of 14 g/dL than for the patients randomized to a target hemoglobin of 10 g/dL. For all-cause mortality, the HR = 1.27; 95% CI (1.04, 1.54); p=0.018. The incidence of nonfatal myocardial infarction, vascular access thrombosis, and other thrombotic events was also higher in the group randomized to a target hemoglobin of 14 g/dL\n【81】 - CHOIR\n【82】 - A randomized, prospective trial, 1432 patients with anemia due to CKD who were not undergoing dialysis and who had not previously received epoetin alfa therapy were randomized to epoetin alfa treatment targeting a maintenance hemoglobin concentration of either 13.5 g/dL or 11.3 g/dL. The trial was terminated early with adverse safety findings. A major cardiovascular event (death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or hospitalization for congestive heart failure) occurred in 125 of the 715 patients (18%) in the higher hemoglobin group compared to 97 of the 717 patients (14%) in the lower hemoglobin group\n【83】 - TREAT\n【84】 - A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, prospective trial of 4038 patients with CKD not on dialysis (eGFR of 20 – 60 mL/min), anemia (hemoglobin levels ≤ 11 g/dL), and type 2 diabetes mellitus, patients were randomized to receive either darbepoetin alfa treatment or a matching placebo. Placebo group patients also received darbepoetin alfa when their hemoglobin levels were below 9 g/dL. The trial objectives were to demonstrate the benefit of darbepoetin alfa treatment of the anemia to a target hemoglobin level of 13 g/dL, when compared to a \"placebo\" group, by reducing the occurrence of either of two primary endpoints:  a composite cardiovascular endpoint of all-cause mortality or a specified cardiovascular event (myocardial ischemia, CHF, MI, and CVA) or  a composite renal endpoint of all-cause mortality or progression to end stage renal disease. The overall risks for each of the two primary endpoints (the cardiovascular composite and the renal composite) were not reduced with darbepoetin alfa treatment , but the risk of stroke was increased nearly two-fold in the darbepoetin alfa-treated group versus the placebo group: annualized stroke rate 2.1% vs. 1.1%, respectively, HR 1.92; 95% CI: 1.38, 2.68; p < 0.001. The relative risk of stroke was particularly high in patients with a prior stroke: annualized stroke rate 5.2% in the darbepoetin alfa treated group and 1.9% in the placebo group, HR 3.07; 95% CI: 1.44, 6.54. Also, among darbepoetin alfa-treated subjects with a past history of cancer, there were more deaths due to all causes and more deaths adjudicated as due to cancer, in comparison with the control group\n【85】 - An increased incidence of thromboembolic reactions, some serious and life-threatening, occurred in patients with cancer treated with ESAs\n【86】 - In a randomized, placebo-controlled study ,Study 1 in  of 939 women with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy, patients received either weekly epoetin alfa or placebo for up to a year. This study was designed to show that survival was superior when epoetin alfa was administered to prevent anemia (maintain hemoglobin levels between 12 and 14 g/dL or hematocrit between 36% and 42%). This study was terminated prematurely when interim results demonstrated a higher mortality at 4 months (8.7% vs. 3.4%) and a higher rate of fatal thrombotic reactions (1.1% vs. 0.2%) in the first 4 months of the study among patients treated with epoetin alfa. Based on Kaplan-Meier estimates, at the time of study termination, the 12-month survival was lower in the epoetin alfa group than in the placebo group (70% vs. 76%; HR 1.37, 95% CI: 1.07, 1.75; p = 0.012)\n【87】 - Darbepoetin alfa is not approved for reduction of RBC transfusions in patients scheduled for surgical procedures\n【88】 - An increased incidence of DVT in patients receiving epoetin alfa undergoing surgical orthopedic procedures was demonstrated. In a randomized, controlled study, 680 adult patients, not receiving prophylactic anticoagulation and undergoing spinal surgery, received epoetin alfa and standard of care (SOC) treatment (n = 340) or SOC treatment alone (n = 340). A higher incidence of DVTs, determined by either color flow duplex imaging or by clinical symptoms, was observed in the epoetin alfa group (16  patients) compared with the SOC group (7  patients). In addition to the 23 patients with DVTs included in the primary analysis, 19  patients experienced 1 other thrombovascular event (TVE) each (12  in the epoetin alfa group and 7  in the SOC group)\n【89】 - Increased mortality was observed in a randomized, placebo-controlled study of epoetin alfa in adult patients who were undergoing CABG surgery (7 deaths in 126 patients randomized to epoetin alfa versus no deaths among 56 patients receiving placebo). Four of these deaths occurred during the period of study drug administration and all 4 deaths were associated with thrombotic events\n【90】 - In order to prescribe and/or dispense darbepoetin alfa to patients with cancer and anemia due to myelosuppressive chemotherapy, prescribers and hospitals must enroll in and comply with the ESA APPRISE Oncology Program requirements. To enroll, visit  or Additionally, prior to each new course of darbepoetin alfa in patients with cancer, prescribers and patients must provide written acknowledgment of a discussion of the risks of darbepoetin alfa\n【91】 - ESAs resulted in decreased locoregional control/progression-free survival and/or overall survival . These findings were observed in studies of patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving radiation therapy (Studies 5 and 6), in patients receiving chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer (Study 1) or lymphoid malignancy (Study 2), and in patients with non-small cell lung cancer or various malignancies who were not receiving chemotherapy or radiotherapy (Studies 7 and 8)\n【92】 - Study 1 was described in the previous section. Mortality at 4 months (8.7% vs. 3.4%) was significantly higher in the epoetin alfa arm. The most common investigator-attributed cause of death within the first 4 months was disease progression; 28 of 41 deaths in the epoetin alfa arm and 13 of 16 deaths in the placebo arm were attributed to disease progression. Investigator-assessed time to tumor progression was not different between the 2 groups. Survival at 12 months was significantly lower in the epoetin alfa arm (70% vs. 76%; HR 1.37, 95% CI: 1.07, 1.75; p = 0.012)\n【93】 - Study 2 was a randomized, double-blind study (darbepoetin alfa vs. placebo) conducted in 344 anemic patients with lymphoid malignancy receiving chemotherapy.  With a median follow-up of 29 months, overall mortality rates were significantly higher among patients randomized to darbepoetin alfa as compared to placebo (HR 1.36, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.82)\n【94】 - Study 7 was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind study (epoetin alfa vs. placebo) in which patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer receiving only palliative radiotherapy or no active therapy were treated with epoetin alfa to achieve and maintain hemoglobin levels between 12 and 14 g/dL. Following an interim analysis of 70 patients (planned accrual 300 patients), a significant difference in survival in favor of the patients in the placebo arm of the study was observed (median survival 63 vs. 129 days; HR 1.84; p = 0.04)\n【95】 - Study 8 was a randomized, double-blind study (darbepoetin alfa vs. placebo) in 989 anemic patients with active malignant disease, neither receiving nor planning to receive chemotherapy or radiation therapy. There was no evidence of a statistically significant reduction in proportion of patients receiving RBC transfusions. The median survival was shorter in the darbepoetin alfa treatment group than in the placebo group (8 months vs. 10.8 months; HR 1.30, 95% CI: 1.07, 1.57)\n【96】 - Study 3 was a randomized, open-label, controlled, factorial design study in which darbepoetin alfa was administered to prevent anemia in 733 women receiving neo-adjuvant breast cancer treatment. A final analysis was performed after a median follow-up of approximately 3 years. The 3-year survival rate was lower (86% vs. 90%; HR 1.42, 95% CI: 0.93, 2.18) and the 3-year relapse-free survival rate was lower (72% vs. 78%; HR 1.33, 95% CI: 0.99, 1.79) in the darbepoetin alfa-treated arm compared to the control arm\n【97】 - Study 4 was a randomized, open-label, controlled study that enrolled 114 of a planned 460 cervical cancer patients receiving chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Patients were randomized to receive epoetin alfa to maintain hemoglobin between 12 and 14 g/dL or to RBC transfusion support as needed. The study was terminated prematurely due to an increase in thromboembolic adverse reactions in epoetin alfa-treated patients compared to control (19% vs. 9%). Both local recurrence (21% vs. 20%) and distant recurrence (12% vs. 7%) were more frequent in epoetin alfa-treated patients compared to control. Progression-free survival at 3 years was lower in the epoetin alfa-treated group compared to control (59% vs. 62%; HR 1.06, 95% CI: 0.58, 1.91). Overall survival at 3 years was lower in the epoetin alfa-treated group compared to control (61% vs. 71%; HR 1.28, 95% CI: 0.68, 2.42)\n【98】 - Study 5 was a randomized, placebo-controlled study in 351 head and neck cancer patients where epoetin beta or placebo was administered to achieve target hemoglobins ≥ 14 and ≥ 15 g/dL for women and men, respectively. Locoregional progression-free survival was significantly shorter in patients receiving epoetin beta (HR 1.62, 95% CI: 1.22, 2.14; p = 0.0008) with medians of 406 days and 745 days in the epoetin beta and placebo arms respectively. Overall survival was significantly shorter in patients receiving epoetin beta (HR 1.39, 95% CI: 1.05, 1.84; p = 0.02)\n【99】 - Study 6 was a randomized, open-label, controlled study conducted in 522 patients with primary squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck receiving radiation therapy alone (no chemotherapy) who were randomized to receive darbepoetin alfa to maintain hemoglobin levels of 14 to15.5 g/dL or no darbepoetin alfa. An interim analysis performed on 484 patients demonstrated that locoregional control at 5 years was significantly shorter in patients receiving darbepoetin alfa (RR 1.44, 95% CI: 1.06, 1.96; p = 0.02). Overall survival was shorter in patients receiving darbepoetin alfa (RR 1.28, 95% CI: 0.98, 1.68; p = 0.08)\n【100】 - Darbepoetin alfa is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. In darbepoetin alfa clinical studies, approximately 40% of patients with CKD required initiation or intensification of antihypertensive therapy during the early phase of treatment. Hypertensive encephalopathy and seizures have been reported in patients with CKD receiving darbepoetin alfa\n【101】 - Appropriately control hypertension prior to initiation of and during treatment with darbepoetin alfa. Reduce or withhold darbepoetin alfa if blood pressure becomes difficult to control. Advise patients of the importance of compliance with antihypertensive therapy and dietary restrictions\n【102】 - Darbepoetin alfa increases the risk of seizures in patients with CKD. During the first several months following initiation of darbepoetin alfa, monitor patients closely for premonitory neurologic symptoms. Advise patients to contact their healthcare practitioner for new-onset seizures, premonitory symptoms, or change in seizure frequency\n【103】 - For lack or loss of hemoglobin response to darbepoetin alfa, initiate a search for causative factors (e.g., iron deficiency, infection, inflammation, bleeding). If typical causes of lack or loss of hemoglobin response are excluded, evaluate for PRCA\n【104】 - In the absence of PRCA, follow dosing recommendations for management of patients with an insufficient hemoglobin response to darbepoetin alfa therapy\n【105】 - Cases of PRCA and of severe anemia, with or without other cytopenias that arise following the development of neutralizing antibodies to erythropoietin have been reported in patients treated with darbepoetin alfa. This has been reported predominantly in patients with CKD receiving ESAs by subcutaneous administration. PRCA has also been reported in patients receiving ESAs for anemia related to hepatitis C treatment (an indication for which darbepoetin alfa is not approved)\n【106】 - If severe anemia and low reticulocyte count develop during treatment with darbepoetin alfa, withhold darbepoetin alfa and evaluate patients for neutralizing antibodies to erythropoietin. Contact Amgen (1-800-77-AMGEN) to perform assays for binding and neutralizing antibodies. Permanently discontinue darbepoetin alfa in patients who develop PRCA following treatment with darbepoetin alfa or other erythropoietin protein drugs. Do not switch patients to other ESAs\n【107】 - Serious allergic reactions, including anaphylactic reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, skin rash, and urticaria may occur with darbepoetin alfa. Immediately and permanently discontinue darbepoetin alfa and administer appropriate therapy if a serious allergic or anaphylactic reaction occurs\n【108】 - Patients may require adjustments in their dialysis prescriptions after initiation of darbepoetin alfa. Patients receiving darbepoetin alfa may require increased anticoagulation with heparin to prevent clotting of the extracorporeal circuit during hemodialysis\n【109】 - Evaluate transferrin saturation and serum ferritin prior to and during darbepoetin alfa treatment. Administer supplemental iron therapy when serum ferritin is less than 100 mcg/L or when serum transferrin saturation is less than 20%. - The majority of patients with CKD will require supplemental iron during the course of ESA therapy. Following initiation of therapy and after each dose adjustment, monitor hemoglobin weekly until the hemoglobin is sand sufficient to minimize the need for RBC transfusion. Thereafter, hemoglobin may be monitored less frequently provided hemoglobin levels remain s\n【110】 # Adverse Reactions\n【111】 # Clinical Trials Experience\n【112】 - The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label:\n【113】 - Increased Mortality, Myocardial Infarction, Stroke, and Thromboembolism\n【114】 - Increased mortality and/or increased risk of tumor progression or recurrence in Patients With Cancer\n【115】 - Hypertension\n【116】 - Seizures\n【117】 - PRCA\n【118】 - Serious allergic reactions\n【119】 - Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of other drugs and may not reflect the rates observed in practice\n【120】 - Adverse reactions were determined based on pooled data from 5 randomized, active-controlled studies of darbepoetin alfa with a total of 1357 patients (darbepoetin alfa 766, epoetin alfa 591). The median duration of exposure for patients receiving darbepoetin alfa was 340 days, with 580 patients exposed for greater than 6 months and 360 patients exposed for greater than 1 year. The median (25th, 75th percentiles) weight-adjusted dose of darbepoetin alfa was 0.50 mcg/kg (0.32, 0.81). The median (range) age for patients administered darbepoetin alfa was 62 years (18 to 88). In the darbepoetin alfa group, 55% were male, 72% were white, 83% were receiving dialysis, and 17% were not receiving dialysis\n【121】 -  lists adverse reactions occurring in ≥ 5% of patients treated with darbepoetin alfa\n【122】 - Rates of adverse reactions with darbepoetin alfa therapy were similar to those observed with other recombinant erythropoietins in these studies\n【123】 - Darbepoetin alfa was administered to 81 pediatric patients with CKD who had shemoglobin concentrations while previously receiving epoetin alfa. In this study, the most frequently reported serious adverse reactions with darbepoetin alfa were hypertension and convulsions. The most commonly reported adverse reactions were hypertension, injection site pain, rash, and convulsions. Darbepoetin alfa administration was discontinued because of injection site pain in 2 patients and moderate hypertension in a third patient\n【124】 - Studies have not evaluated the effects of darbepoetin alfa when administered to pediatric patients as the initial treatment for the anemia associated with CKD\n【125】 - Adverse reactions were based on data from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of darbepoetin alfa in 597 patients (darbepoetin alfa 301, placebo 296) with extensive stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC) receiving platinum-based chemotherapy. All patients were white, 64% were male, and the median age was 61 years (range: 28 to 82 years); 25% of the study population were from North America, Western Europe, and Australia. Patients received darbepoetin alfa at a dose of 300 mcg or placebo weekly for 4 weeks then every 3 weeks for a total of 24 weeks, and the median duration of exposure was 19 weeks (range: 1 to 26 weeks)\n【126】 - Adverse reactions were also based on data from 7 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, including the SCLC study described above, that enrolled 2112 patients (darbepoetin alfa 1203, placebo 909) with non-myeloid malignancies.  Most patients were white (95%), male (52%), and the median age was 63 years (range: 18 to 91 years); 73% of the study population were from North America, Western Europe, and Australia.  Dosing and schedules varied by study from once weekly to once every 4 weeks, and the median duration of exposure was 12 weeks (range: 1 to 27 weeks)\n【127】 - In addition to the thrombovascular adverse reactions, abdominal pain and edema occurred at a higher incidence in patients taking darbepoetin alfa compared to patients on placebo. Among all placebo-controlled studies, abdominal pain (13.2% vs. 9.4%) and edema (12.8% vs. 9.7%) were reported more frequently in patients receiving darbepoetin alfa compared to the placebo group. In the SCLC study the incidence of abdominal pain (10.3% vs. 3.4%) and edema (5.6% vs. 5.1%) in the darbepoetin alfa-treated patients compared to those receiving placebo\n【128】 ## Postmarketing Experience\n【129】 - Because postmarketing reporting of adverse reactions is voluntary and from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure\n【130】 - The following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of darbepoetin alfa:\n【131】 - Seizures\n【132】 - PRCA\n【133】 - Serious allergic reactions\n【134】 - As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. Neutralizing antibodies to darbepoetin alfa that cross-react with endogenous erythropoietin and other ESAs can result in PRCA or severe anemia (with or without other cytopenias)\n【135】 - In clinical studies, the percentage of patients with antibodies to darbepoetin alfa was examined using the Biacore assay. Sera from 1501 patients with CKD and 1159 cancer patients were tested. At baseline, prior to darbepoetin alfa treatment, binding antibodies were detected in 59 patients (4%) with CKD and 36 cancer patients (3%). During darbepoetin alfa therapy (range: 22 to 177 weeks), a follow-up sample was taken. One additional patient with CKD and 8 additional cancer patients developed antibodies capable of binding darbepoetin alfa. None of the patients had antibodies capable of neutralizing the activity of darbepoetin alfa or endogenous erythropoietin at baseline or at end of study. No clinical sequelae consistent with PRCA were associated with the presence of these antibodies\n【136】 - The incidence of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors, including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to darbepoetin alfa with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading\n【137】 # Drug Interactions\n【138】 - There is limited information regarding Darbepoetin alfa Drug Interactions in the drug label\n【139】 # Usein Specific Populations\n【140】 ### Pregnancy\n【141】 - Pregnancy Category (FDA): C\n【142】 - There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of darbepoetin alfa use in pregnant women. In animal reproduction and developmental toxicity studies, darbepoetin alfa increased early post-implantation loss. Use darbepoetin alfa during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus\n【143】 - When darbepoetin alfa was administered intravenously to healthy pregnant rats and rabbits, there was no evidence of embryofetal toxicity or other adverse outcomes at the intravenous doses tested, up to 20 mcg/kg/day. This animal dose level of 20 mcg/kg/day is approximately 20-fold higher than the clinical recommended starting dose, depending on the patient’s treatment indication. Slightly reduced fetal weights were observed when healthy rat and rabbit mothers received doses of 1 mcg/kg or more. This dose of 1 mcg/kg is near the clinical recommended starting dose. While no adverse effects on uterine implantation occurred in animals, there was an increase in early post-implantation loss in animal fertility studies. It is not clear whether the increased post-implantation loss reflects a drug effect on the uterine environment or on the conceptus. No significant placental transfer of darbepoetin alfa was detected\n【144】 - In a peri/postnatal development study, pregnant female rats received darbepoetin alfa intravenously every other day from implantation throughout pregnancy and lactation. The lowest dose tested, 0.5 mcg/kg, did not cause fetal toxicity; this dose is approximately equivalent to the clinical recommended starting dose. At maternal doses of 2.5 mcg/kg and higher, pups had decreased fetal body weights, which correlated with a slight increase in the incidence of fetal deaths, as well as delayed eye opening and delayed preputial separation\n【145】 - Women who become pregnant during darbepoetin alfa treatment are encouraged to enroll in Amgen’s Pregnancy Surveillance P\n【146】 - Pregnancy Category (AUS):\n【147】 - Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) Pregnancy Category\n【148】 - There is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Darbepoetin alfa in women who are pregnant\n【149】 ### Labor and Delivery\n【150】 - There is no FDA guidance on use of Darbepoetin alfa during labor and delivery\n【151】 ### Nursing Mothers\n【152】 - It is not known whether darbepoetin alfa is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when darbepoetin alfa is administered to a nursing woman\n【153】 ### Pediatric Use\n【154】 - Darbepoetin alfa safety and efficacy were similar between adults and pediatric patients with CKD who were over 1 year of age when patients were transitioned from treatment with epoetin alfa to darbepoetin alfa\n【155】 - Darbepoetin alfa safety and efficacy have not been established in the initial treatment of anemic pediatric patients with CKD or in the transition from another erythropoietin to darbepoetin alfa in pediatric CKD patients less than 1 year of age\n【156】 - The safety and efficacy of darbepoetin alfa in pediatric cancer patients have not been established\n【157】 ### Geriatic Use\n【158】 - Of the 1801 patients with CKD in clinical studies of darbepoetin alfa, 44% were age 65 and over, while 17% were age 75 and over. Of the 873 patients in clinical studies receiving darbepoetin alfa and concomitant cancer chemotherapy, 45% were age 65 and over, while 14% were age 75 and over. No differences in safety or efficacy were observed between older and younger patients\n【159】 ### Gender\n【160】 - There is no FDA guidance on the use of Darbepoetin alfa with respect to specific gender populations\n【161】 ### Race\n【162】 - There is no FDA guidance on the use of Darbepoetin alfa with respect to specific racial populations\n【163】 ### Renal Impairment\n【164】 - There is no FDA guidance on the use of Darbepoetin alfa in patients with renal impairment\n【165】 ### Hepatic Impairment\n【166】 - There is no FDA guidance on the use of Darbepoetin alfa in patients with hepatic impairment\n【167】 # Femalesof Reproductive Potentialand Males\n【168】 - There is no FDA guidance on the use of Darbepoetin alfa in women of reproductive potentials and males\n【169】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\n【170】 - There is no FDA guidance one the use of Darbepoetin alfa in patients who are immunocompromised\n【171】 # Administration and Monitoring\n【172】 ### Administration\n【173】 - Oral\n【174】 - Intravenous\n【175】 ### Monitoring\n【176】 - To undergo regular blood pressure monitoring, adhere to prescribed anti-hypertensive regimen and follow recommended dietary restrictions\n【177】 - Evaluate transferrin saturation and serum ferritin prior to and during darbepoetin alfa treatment. Administer supplemental iron therapy when serum ferritin is less than 100 mcg/L or when serum transferrin saturation is less than 20%. The majority of patients with CKD will require supplemental iron during the course of ESA therapy\n【178】 - Following initiation of therapy and after each dose adjustment, monitor hemoglobin weekly until the hemoglobin is sand sufficient to minimize the need for RBC transfusion. Thereafter, hemoglobin may be monitored less frequently provided hemoglobin levels remain s\n【179】 # IV Compatibility\n【180】 - There is limited information regarding IV Compatibility of Darbepoetin alfa in the drug label\n【181】 # Overdosage\n【182】 - Darbepoetin alfa overdosage can cause hemoglobin levels above the desired level, which should be managed with discontinuation or reduction of darbepoetin alfa dosage and/or with phlebotomy, as clinically indicated. Cases of severe hypertension have been observed following overdose with ESAs\n【183】 # Pharmacology\n【184】 - There is limited information regarding Darbepoetin alfa Pharmacology in the drug label\n【185】 ## Mechanism of Action\n【186】 - Darbepoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis by the same mechanism as endogenous erythropoetin\n【187】 ## Structure\n【188】 - Darbepoetin alfa is an erythropoiesis-stimulating protein that is produced in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells by recombinant DNA technology\n【189】 - Darbepoetin alfa is a 165-amino acid protein that differs from recombinant human erythropoietin in containing 5 N-linked oligosaccharide chains, whereas recombinant human erythropoietin contains 3 chains. The 2 additional N-glycosylation sites result from amino acid substitutions in the erythropoietin peptide backbone. The approximate molecular weight of darbepoetin alfa is 37,000 daltons\n【190】 - Darbepoetin alfa is formulated as a sterile, colorless, preservative-free solution containing polysorbate for intravenous or subcutaneous administration. Each 1 mL contains polysorbate 80 (0.05 mg), sodium chloride (8.18 mg), sodium phosphate dibasic anhydrous (0.66 mg), and sodium phosphate monobasic monohydrate (2.12 mg) in Water for Injection, USP (pH 6.2 ± 0.2)\n【191】 ## Pharmacodynamics\n【192】 - Increased hemoglobin levels are not generally observed until 2 to 6 weeks after initiating treatment with darbepoetin alfa\n【193】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n【194】 - The pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa were studied in patients with CKD receiving or not receiving dialysis and cancer patients receiving chemotherapy\n【195】 - Following intravenous administration of darbepoetin alfa to patients with CKD receiving dialysis, darbepoetin alfa serum concentration-time profiles were biphasic, with a distribution half-life of approximately 1.4 hours and a mean terminal half-life (t1/2) of 21 hours. The t1/2 of darbepoetin alfa was approximately 3-fold longer than that of epoetin alfa when administered intravenously\n【196】 - Following subcutaneous administration of darbepoetin alfa to patients with CKD (receiving or not receiving dialysis), absorption was slow and Cmax occurred at 48 hours (range: 12 to 72 hours). In patients with CKD receiving dialysis, the average t1/2 was 46 hours (range: 12 to 89 hours), and in patients with CKD not receiving dialysis, the average t1/2 was 70 hours (range: 35 to 139 hours). Darbepoetin alfa apparent clearance was approximately 1.4 times faster on average in patients receiving dialysis compared to patients not receiving dialysis. The bioavailability of darbepoetin alfa in patients with CKD receiving dialysis after subcutaneous administration was 37% (range: 30% to 50%)\n【197】 - Pediatric Patients with CKD\n【198】 - Darbepoetin alfa pharmacokinetics was studied in 12 pediatric patients (age 3 to 16 years) with CKD receiving or not receiving dialysis. Following a single intravenous or subcutaneous darbepoetin alfa dose, Cmax and t1/2 were similar to those obtained in adult patients with CKD on dialysis. Following a single subcutaneous dose, the average bioavailability was 54% (range: 32% to 70%), which was higher than that obtained in adult patients with CKD on dialysis\n【199】 - Following the first subcutaneous dose of 6.75 mcg/kg (equivalent to 500 mcg for a 74-kg patient) in patients with cancer, the mean t1/2 was 74 hours (range: 24 to 144 hours) and Cmax was observed at 71 hours (range: 28 to 120 hours). When administered on a once every 3 week schedule, 48-hour postdose darbepoetin alfa levels after the fourth dose were similar to those after the first dose\n【200】 - Over the dose range of 0.45 to 4.5 mcg/kg darbepoetin alfa administered intravenously or subcutaneously on a once weekly schedule and 4.5 to 15 mcg/kg administered subcutaneously on a once every 3 week schedule, systemic exposure was approximately proportional to dose. No evidence of accumulation was observed beyond an expected less than 2-fold increase in blood levels when compared to the initial dose\n【201】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\n【202】 - The carcinogenic potential of darbepoetin alfa has not been evaluated in long-term animal studies. In toxicity studies of approximately 6 months duration in rats and dogs, no tumorigenic or unexpected mitogenic responses were observed in any tissue type\n【203】 - Darbepoetin alfa was not mutagenic or clastogenic under the conditions tested. Darbepoetin alfa was negative in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay, the in vitro mammalian cell gene mutation assay (using CHO cells), and in the in vivo mouse erythrocyte micronucleus assay\n【204】 - Darbepoetin alfa increased the incidence of post-implantation losses in rats. Male and female rats received intravenous doses prior to and during mating; then females were treated 3 times weekly during the first trimester of gestation (gestation days 1, 3, 5, and 7). No effect on reproductive performance, fertility, or sperm assessment parameters were detected at any of the doses evaluated (up to 10 mcg/kg, administered 3 times weekly). The dose of 10 mcg/kg is more than 10-fold higher than the clinical recommended starting dose. An increase in post-implantation fetal loss was seen at doses equal to or greater than 0.5 mcg/kg, administered 3 times weekly. The dose of 0.5 mcg/kg is approximately equivalent to the clinical recommended starting dose. Signs of exaggerated pharmacology were not observed in the mother receiving 0.5 mcg/kg or less, but were observed at 2.5 mcg/kg and higher\n【205】 - When darbepoetin alfa was administered intravenously during organogenesis to pregnant rats (gestational days 6 to 15) and rabbits (gestational days 6 to 18), no evidence of direct embryotoxic, fetotoxic, or teratogenic outcomes were observed at the doses tested, up to 20 mcg/kg/day. This animal dose level of 20 mcg/kg/day is approximately 20-fold higher than the clinical recommended starting dose, depending on the patient’s treatment indication. The only adverse effect observed was a slight reduction in fetal weight, which occurred only at doses causing exaggerated pharmacological effects in both the rat and rabbit dams (1 mcg/kg/day and higher). No deleterious effects on uterine implantation were seen in either species\n【206】 - No significant placental transfer of darbepoetin alfa was observed in rats; placental transfer was not evaluated in rabbits\n【207】 - In a peri/postnatal development study, pregnant female rats were treated intravenously with darbepoetin alfa day 6 of gestation through day 23 of lactation at 2.5 mcg/kg and higher every other day. Pups of treated mothers had decreased fetal body weights, which correlated with slight increases in the incidences of fetal death, as well as delayed eye opening and delayed preputial separation. The offspring (F1 generation) of the treated rats were observed postnatally; rats from the F1 generation reached maturity and were mated; no darbepoetin alfa-related effects were apparent for their offspring (F2 generation fetuses)\n【208】 # Clinical Studies\n【209】 - Clinical studies in the nephrology and chemotherapy-induced anemia clinical programs are designated with the prefixes “N” and “C”, respectively\n【210】 - Patients with chronic kidney disease on dialysis: ESA effects on rates of transfusion\n【211】 - In early clinical studies conducted in CKD patients on dialysis, ESAs have been shown to reduce the use of RBC transfusions. These studies enrolled patients with mean baseline hemoglobin levels of approximately 7.5 g/dL and ESAs were generally titrated to achieve a hemoglobin level of approximately 12 g/dL. Fewer transfusions were given during the ESA treatment period when compared to a pre-treatment interval\n【212】 - In the Normal Hematocrit Study, the yearly transfusion rate was 51.5% in the lower hemoglobin group (10 g/dL) and 32.4% in the higher hemoglobin group (14 g/dL)\n【213】 - Patients with chronic kidney disease not on dialysis: ESA effects on rates of transfusion\n【214】 - In TREAT, a randomized, double-blind trial of 4038 patients with CKD and type 2 diabetes not on dialysis, a post-hoc analysis showed that the proportion of patients receiving RBC transfusions was lower in patients administered darbepoetin alfa to target a hemoglobin of 13 g/dL compared to the control arm in which darbepoetin alfa was administered intermittently if hemoglobin concentration decreased to less than 9 g/dL (15% versus 25%, respectively). In CHOIR, a randomized open-label study of 1432 patients with CKD not on dialysis, use of an ESA to target a higher (13.5 g/dL) versus lower (11.3 g/dL) hemoglobin goal did not reduce the use of RBC transfusions. In each trial, no benefits occurred for the cardiovascular or end-stage renal disease outcomes. In each trial, the potential benefit of ESA therapy was offset by worse cardiovascular safety outcomes resulting in an unfavorable benefit-risk profile\n【215】 - Darbepoetin alfa use has not been demonstrated in controlled clinical trials to improve quality of life, fatigue, or patient well-being\n【216】 - ESA Effects on rates of death and other serious cardiac adverse events\n【217】 - Three randomized outcome trials (Normal Hematocrit Study , Correction of Anemia with Epoetin Alfa in Chronic Kidney Disease , and Trial of Darbepoetin Alfa in Type 2 Diabetes and CKD ) have been conducted in patients with CKD using Epogen/PROCRIT/darbepoetin alfa to target higher vs. lower hemoglobin levels. Though these trials were designed to establish a cardiovascular or renal benefit of targeting higher hemoglobin levels, in all 3 studies, patients randomized to the higher hemoglobin target experienced worse cardiovascular outcomes and showed no reduction in progression to ESRD. In each trial, the potential benefit of ESA therapy was offset by worse cardiovascular safety outcomes resulting in an unfavorable benefit-risk profile\n【218】 - Two studies evaluated the safety and efficacy of the de novo use of darbepoetin alfa for the correction of anemia in adult patients with CKD, and 3 studies (2 in adults and 1 in pediatric patients) assessed the ability of darbepoetin alfa to maintain hemoglobin concentrations in patients with CKD who had been receiving other recombinant erythropoietins\n【219】 - Once Weekly darbepoetin alfa Starting Dose\n【220】 - In 2 randomized, open-label studies, darbepoetin alfa or epoetin alfa was administered for the correction of anemia in patients with CKD who had not been receiving prior treatment with exogenous erythropoietin. Study N1 evaluated CKD patients receiving dialysis; Study N2 evaluated patients not requiring dialysis. In both studies, the starting dose of darbepoetin alfa was 0.45 mcg/kg administered once weekly. The starting dose of epoetin alfa was 50 Units/kg 3 times weekly in Study N1 and 50 Units/kg twice weekly in Study N2. When necessary, dosage adjustments were instituted to maintain hemoglobin in the study target range of 11 to 13 g/dL. ,Note: The recommended hemoglobin target range is lower than the target range of these studies. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients who experienced at least a 1 g/dL increase in hemoglobin concentration to a level of at least 11 g/dL by 20 weeks (Study N1) or 24 weeks (Study N2). The studies were designed to assess the safety and effectiveness of darbepoetin alfa but not to support conclusions regarding comparisons between the 2 products\n【221】 - In Study N1, the primary efficacy endpoint was achieved by 72% (95% CI: 62%, 81%) of the 90 patients treated with darbepoetin alfa and 84% (95% CI: 66%, 95%) of the 31 patients treated with epoetin alfa. The mean increase in hemoglobin over the initial 4 weeks of darbepoetin alfa treatment was 1.1 g/dL (95% CI: 0.82 g/dL, 1.37 g/dL)\n【222】 - In Study N2, the primary efficacy endpoint was achieved by 93% (95% CI: 87%, 97%) of the 129 patients treated with darbepoetin alfa and 92% (95% CI: 78%, 98%) of the 37 patients treated with epoetin alfa. The mean increase in hemoglobin from baseline through the initial 4 weeks of darbepoetin alfa treatment was 1.38 g/dL (95% CI: 1.21 g/dL, 1.55 g/dL)\n【223】 - In 2 single-arm studies (N3 and N4), darbepoetin alfa was administered for the correction of anemia in CKD patients not receiving dialysis. In both studies, the starting dose of darbepoetin alfa was 0.75 mcg/kg administered once every 2 weeks\n【224】 - In Study N3 (study duration of 18 weeks), the hemoglobin goal (hemoglobin concentration ≥ 11 g/dL) was achieved by 92% (95% CI: 86%, 96%) of the 128 patients treated with darbepoetin alfa\n【225】 - In Study N4 (study duration of 24 weeks), the hemoglobin goal (hemoglobin concentration of 11 to 13 g/dL) was achieved by 85% (95% CI: 77%, 93%) of the 75 patients treated with darbepoetin alfa\n【226】 - Two studies of adults (N5 and N6) and 1 study in pediatric patients (N7) were conducted in patients who had been receiving other recombinant erythropoietins for treatment of the anemia due to CKD. The studies compared the abilities of darbepoetin alfa and other erythropoietins to maintain hemoglobin concentrations within a study target range of 9 to 13 g/dL in adults and 10 to 12.5 g/dL in pediatric patients. (Note: The recommended hemoglobin target is lower than the target range of these studies) . Patients who had been receiving sdoses of other recombinant erythropoietins were randomized to darbepoetin alfa or continued with their prior erythropoietin at the previous dose and schedule. For patients randomized to darbepoetin alfa, the initial weekly dose was determined on the basis of the previous total weekly dose of recombinant erythropoietin\n【227】 - Study N5  was a double-blind study in which 169 hemodialysis patients were randomized to treatment with darbepoetin alfa and 338 patients continued on epoetin alfa. - Study N6 was an open-label study in which 347 patients were randomized to treatment with darbepoetin alfa and 175 patients were randomized to continue on epoetin alfa or epoetin beta. Of the patients randomized to darbepoetin alfa, 92% were receiving hemodialysis and 8% were receiving peritoneal dialysis\n【228】 - In Study N5, a median weekly dose of 0.53 mcg/kg darbepoetin alfa (25th, 75th percentiles: 0.30, 0.93 mcg/kg) was required to maintain hemoglobin in the study target range. In Study N6, a median weekly dose of 0.41 mcg/kg darbepoetin alfa (25th, 75th percentiles: 0.26, 0.65 mcg/kg) was required to maintain hemoglobin in the study target range\n【229】 - Study N7 was an open-label, randomized study conducted in the United States in pediatric patients from 1 to 18 years of age with CKD receiving or not receiving dialysis. Eighty-one patients with hemoglobin concentrations that were son epoetin alfa received darbepoetin alfa (subcutaneously or intravenously), and 42 patients continued to receive epoetin alfa at the current dose, schedule, and route of administration. Patients received darbepoetin alfa once weekly if previously receiving epoetin alfa 2 or 3 times weekly or once every other week if previously receiving epoetin alfa weekly. A median weekly dose of 0.41 mcg/kg darbepoetin alfa (25th, 75th percentiles: 0.25, 0.82 mcg/kg) was required to maintain hemoglobin in the study target range\n【230】 - The safety and efficacy of darbepoetin alfa was assessed in two multicenter, randomized studies in patients with anemia due to the effect of concomitantly administered cancer chemotherapy. Study C1 was a randomized (1:1), placebo-controlled, double-blind, multinational study conducted in 314 patients where darbepoetin alfa was administered weekly. Study C2 was a randomized (1:1), double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled, multinational study conducted in 705 patients where darbepoetin alfa was administered either every week or every 3 weeks. Efficacy was demonstrated by a statistically significant reduction in the proportion of patients receiving RBC transfusions among patients who were on study therapy for more than 28 days\n【231】 - Study C1 was conducted in anemic patients (hemoglobin ≤ 11 g/dL) with non-small cell lung cancer or small cell lung cancer who were scheduled to receive at least 12 weeks of a platinum-containing chemotherapy regimen. Randomization was stratified by tumor type and region (Australia vs. Canada vs. Europe). Patients received darbepoetin alfa 2.25 mcg/kg or placebo as a weekly subcutaneous injection commencing on the first day of the chemotherapy cycle. Efficacy was determined by a reduction in the proportion of patients who received RBC transfusions between week 5 (day 29) and end of treatment period (12 weeks) in the subset of 297 randomized patients (148 darbepoetin alfa and 149 placebo) who were on-study at the beginning of study week 5. All 297 patients were white, 72% were male, 71% had non-small cell histology, and the median age was 62 years (range: 36 to 80). A significantly lower proportion of patients in the darbepoetin alfa arm received RBC transfusions during week 5 to the end of treatment compared to patients in the placebo arm (crude percentages: 26% vs. 50%; p < 0.001, based on a comparison of the difference in Kaplan-Meier proportions using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel strata-adjusted Chi-square test)\n【232】 - Study C2 was conducted in anemic patients (hemoglobin < 11 g/dL) with non-myeloid malignancies receiving chemotherapy. Randomization was stratified by region (Western vs. Central/Eastern Europe), tumor type (lung and gynecological vs. others), and baseline hemoglobin (< 10 vs. ≥ 10 g/dL); all patients received double-dummy placebo and either darbepoetin alfa  500 mcg every 3 weeks or darbepoetin alfa 2.25 mcg/kg weekly subcutaneous injections for 15 weeks. Only 1 patient was non-white, 55% were female, and the median age was 60 years (range: 20 to 86). One hundred seven patients (16%) had lung or gynecological cancer while 565 (84%) had other tumor types. In both treatment schedules, the dose was reduced by 40% of the previous dose if hemoglobin level increased by more than 1 g/dL in a 14-day period\n【233】 - Efficacy was determined by a comparison of the proportion of patients who received at least 1 RBC transfusion between week 5 (day 29) and the end of treatment. Three hundred thirty-five patients in the every 3 week dosing arm and 337 patients in the weekly dosing arm remained on study through or beyond day 29 and were evaluable for efficacy. Two hundred thirty-eight patients (71%) in the every 3 week arm and 261 patients (77%) patients in the weekly arm required dose reductions. Twenty-three percent (95% CI: 18%, 28%) of patients in the every 3 week treatment schedule and 28% (95% CI: 24%, 34%) in the weekly schedule received at least 1 RBC transfusion. The observed difference in the RBC transfusion rates (every 3 week minus weekly) was -5.8% (95% CI: -12.4%, 0.8%)\n【234】 - Study C3 was conducted in patients required to have a hemoglobin concentration ≥ 9 g/dL and ≤ 13 g/dL with previously untreated extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC) receiving platinum and etoposide chemotherapy.  Randomization was stratified by region (Western Europe, Australia/North America, and rest of world), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (0 or 1 vs. 2), and lactate dehydrogenase (below vs. above the upper limit of normal).  Patients were randomized to receive darbepoetin alfa  (n = 298) at a dose of 300 mcg once weekly for the first 4 weeks, followed by 300 mcg once every 3 weeks for the remainder of the treatment period or placebo (n = 298)\n【235】 - This study was designed to detect a prolongation in overall survival (from a median of 9 months to a median of 12 months). For the final analysis, there was no evidence of improved survival (p=0.43, log-rank test)\n【236】 # How Supplied\n【237】 - There is limited information regarding Darbepoetin alfa How Supplied in the drug label\n【238】 ## Storage\n【239】 - Store at 36°F to 46°F (2°C to 8°C).

These new recommendations take into account two significant recent advances: demonstration of the increased efficacy of a new formulation for ORS containing lower concentrations of glucose and salt, and success in using zinc supplementation in addition to rehydration therapy in the management of diarrhoeal diseases 1\n【2】 - In order to ensure that these recommendations become effective, it is essential that the industry be encouraged to prepare zinc formulations which contain only zinc as active ingredient. Many vitamin products and other nutritional supplements containing zinc are available commercially. However, it is uncommon for these products to have the recommended dosage of zinc. Therefore a product containing only zinc is required. The product should be formulated in such a way as to mask the strong metallic aftertaste of zinc to enhance acceptability to children. Zinc salt formulations for administration to children could take the form of oral solution or ts. The specifications of zinc products for use in the management of diarrhoea are listed in Annex 1\n【3】 - For all organizations involved in the procurement of zinc ts or zinc oral solutions, the procurement should be made from trusted sources, such as those companies pre-qualified for zinc ts and oral solutions in the UNICEF suppliers list and those with a proven record of quality products. When organizations make a tender to purchase zinc products, the tender should clearly state the quality specifications required as mentioned in Annex 1. In addition, zinc sulfate ts and zinc sulfate oral solutions should comply with the specifications as detailed in the relevant pharmacopoeial monographs for zinc sulfate ts and/or zinc sulfate oral solution . Relevant monographs on zinc sulfate ts and zinc sulfate oral solutions are also under development for inclusion in the International Pharmacopoeia. These guidelines were prepared to assist policy makers and programme managers in the selection and procurement of quality zinc products (zinc ts and zinc oral solutions) for use in the prevention and treatment of diarrhoea in children under the age of five. These guidelines can also be used by pharmaceutical manufacturers to develop quality zinc products\n【4】 # Ingredients and process\n【5】 # Starting materials\n【6】 - Starting materials are defined as those materials which are used in the manufacture of a pharmaceutical product or those which come into contact with the product during its manufacture. They may include raw materials, active and inactive ingredients, excipients, propellants, containers, and packaging material. An important aspect of good manufacturing practices (GMP) for pharmaceutical products is assuring the quality of all the starting materials used. The need for analytical testing to check the quality of starting materials is explained in detail in section 14 of the WHO GMP guidelines referred to above. Failure to ensure that starting materials are of the required quality can have very serious consequences\n【7】 - Zinc in zinc ts and zinc oral solutions can be in the form of zinc sulfate, zinc gluconate, or zinc acetate, all water-soluble zinc salts. The most widely used zinc salt is zinc sulfate, essentially because it is the cheapest of the three zinc salts mentioned above. Clinical trials that have evaluated the efficacy of zinc supplementation in the management of diarrhoea have used these three zinc salts and no difference in efficacy has been shown. Therefore, they are considered equally effective. However, because zinc sulfate is the most widely used salt of zinc, this document is focusing on zinc products containing zinc sulfate\n【8】 # : Safety concern\n【9】 - Many developing countries are wholly dependent on the importation of starting materials for use in the local production of essential and generic medicines. Starting materials often change hands many times before reaching the manufacturer or assembler of the final marketed product and there are many opportunities for the material to undergo re-labelling along the distribution and trade chain. As a result, chemicals and materials required for production of pharmaceutical products can become contaminated or undergo a change in identity, either accidentally or as a result of negligence, and sometimes fraud\n【10】 - The most documented incidents of contamination involve diethylene glycol, which is now held responsible for hundreds of unnecessary deaths throughout the world 1. Ingestion of diethylene glycol often leads to death through kidney failure\n【11】 - In Haiti in 1996, some 100 children died after taking paediatric syrup containing glycerol contaminated with diethylene glycol. Further incidents have occurred in 1998 in Gurgaon, India, and in 2006 in Panama. The quality of the active ingredient should comply with the relevant substance monograph 1\n【12】 # Sweetening and flavouring agents\n【13】 - Zinc ts and zinc oral solutions may contain one or more suiflavours and sweeteners for greater acceptability. The label should indicate the name(s) and amount(s) of any added substances(s). Such added substances -Should be harmless in the amounts used, Should not exceed the minimum quantity required for providing their intended effect, Should not impair the bioavailability or the therapeutic efficacy or safety of the preparation, and Should not interfere with the assays and tests used to determine compliance with the pharmacopoeial standards\n【14】 - Strength indicates the prescribed amount of active ingredient in a single t or in a specified volume of an oral solution. This amount can be verified by using the assay as described below\n【15】 - ts may contain either 10 or 20 mg of zinc and the concentration of zinc in oral solutions may be 10mg/5mL. Decisions about the best strength to be used should depend on better adherence to treatment by patient, taking into consideration other issues as well, such as price, medicine delivery, and duration of treatment (10-or 14-day treatment). Preferably, in any given country, only one strength of ts or oral solution should be available to avoid dosing errors. If 10-mg zinc ts are chosen, it will mean that older children will have to take two ts each day; if 20-mg zinc ts are chosen, it will mean that for younger infants only half a t will be given each day and therefore ts will have to be scored to facilitate this\n【16】 - With oral solutions, because it is difficult to accurately measure half a teaspoon of solution, it is recommended that oral solution of zinc contain 10mg of elemental zinc per 5 mL, that is to say per one teaspoon. It means that infants below 6 months of age will receive one teaspoon, while older children will need 2 teaspoons of oral solution per day\n【17】 - It is very important to specify the dosage needed during procurement\n【18】 - Identification (ID) test verifies the identity of the substance as described in the labelling. As described in the USP monographs (Annexes 2 and 3), the identity of zinc sulfate is verified by simple and rapid colorimetric reactions, using the two tests described in sections 2\n【19】 - Test solution -Dissolve a portion of powdered ts in water, or dilute a small quantity of oral solution in water to obtain a solution containing about 0.05 g of zinc sulfate per mL\n【20】 - Glycerine Solution -a mixture of glycerine and water (85:15). Sodium Sulfide Solution -Dissolve 12 g of sodium sulfide with heating in 45 mL of a mixture of water and glycerine solution (10:29), allow to cool, and dilute to 100 mL with the same mixture of solvents. The solution should be colourless\n【21】 - Hydrochloric Acid Solution -Transfer 20 g of hydrochloric acid to a 100-mL volumetric flask and dilute to volume with water and mix\n【22】 - Barium Chloride Solution -Transfer 61 g of barium chloride to a 1000-mL volumetric flask, dissolve in water, and dilute to volume with the same solvent and mix\n【23】 - Sodium Hydroxide Solution -Transfer 42 g of sodium hydroxide to a 100-mL volumetric flask, and dilute to volume with water and mix. Ammonium Chloride Solution -Transfer 107 g of ammonium chloride to a 1000-mL volumetric flask, and dilute to volume with water and mix\n【24】 # Identification tests 2.3.2.1 Sulfate\n【25】 - To 5 mL of the Test solution add 1 mL of Hydrochloric Acid Solution and 1 mL of Barium Chloride Solution. A white precipitate is formed\n【26】 - To 5 mL of the Test solution add 0.2 mL of Sodium Hydroxide Solution. A white precipitate is formed. Add an additional 2 mL of Sodium Hydroxide Solution and the precipitate dissolves. Add 10 mL of Ammonium Chloride Solution and the solution remains clear. Add 0.1 mL of Sodium Sulfide Solution and a white precipitate is formed\n【27】 - Assays are conducted to confirm the content claimed in the labelling. For example, if the labelling on the package indicates 20 milligram (mg) elemental zinc ts or oral solutions containing 10mg/5 mL of elemental zinc, the assay test should confirm that the value obtained is between the limits of not less than 95 percent and not more than 105 percent for ts or between the limits of not less than 90 percent and not more than 110 percent for oral solution\n【28】 # Assay for ts\n【29】 - Weigh and finely powder not fewer than 20 ts. Transfer an accurately weighed portion of the powder, equivalent to about 90 mg of zinc to a 200-mL volumetric flask. Dissolve in 15 mL of dilute acetic acid, and sonicate for 15 minutes. Dilute with water to volume, and mix. Add 50 mg of xylenol orange triturate to the solution, and mix. Neutralize the solution with about 2 g of methenamine until the solution is a violet-pink colour. Titrate with 0.1 M edetate disodium VS (EDTA) until the solution is yellow\n【30】 # Assay for oral solutions\n【31】 - Transfer an accurately measured volume of zinc oral solution, equivalent to about 99 mg of zinc to a 250-mL flask. Add 50 mL of water and 10 mL of ammonia-ammonium chloride buffer TS and 0.3 mL of eriochrome black TS, and titrate with 0.05 M edetate disodium VS until the solution is green\n【32】 # Packaging and storage\n【33】 - Zinc sulfate ts and zinc oral solutions should be kept in a well-closed container. A well-closed container is by definition a container that must protect the product from extrinsic solids and from loss of the article when subjected to ordinary or customary conditions of handling, shipment, storage, and distribution\n【34】 - Because dispersible ts are water sensitive, blister packing appears to be the most suipresentation for this formulation. The zinc ts should not be packaged in bottles or other similar multi-dose containers because they will be subjected to humidity each time the container is opened and may start to disintegrate. Zinc sulfate ts should be stored in accordance with the directions given by the manufacturer\n【35】 - Zinc sulfate oral solution should be kept in a well-closed container. In addition, it should be protected from light and stored in accordance with the directions given by the manufacturer\n【36】 - Zinc solutions are less sthan solid dosage forms, and therefore in developing countries the proper storage of oral solutions is more difficult than the storage of ts. Stability studies of zinc oral solutions must be conducted at room temperature in order to demonstrate that zinc oral solutions can be stored at such a temperature\n【37】 - Labelling refers to all labels and other written or graphic material printed upon the container of an article, or upon any package or wrapper in which the article is enclosed. The label on the package should include the name and amount of the active ingredient, batch number, expiry date, manufacturer's name and address, number of units per package, and dosage form. The package insert and/or the package should include relevant information, such as directions for use, content of all ingredients, adverse effects, contraindications, storage conditions, etc. When drawings or any other designs are added to facilitate adherence to treatment and intake of the medicine, the required GMP information, such as expiry date, batch number, strength, number of units, and dosage form should still be clearly printed in the secondary package. Additional specifications for zinc ts 3\n【38】 # Dispersibility of zinc ts\n【39】 - Because this treatment is intended for infants and young children, zinc ts should be dispersible. The disintegration of a zinc t in a small volume (5 mL) of water or breast milk should occur in less than one minute. Disintegration is complete when there is no solid part of the t left. Because the zinc salts recommended above are all highly soluble in water, when ts are fully disintegrated the zinc salt can be considered as fully dissolved in the water. Therefore, zinc ts should be tested for disintegration time, and procurement agencies should check the certificate of analysis for disintegration data\n【40】 - According to the USP monograph, disintegration time of zinc ts should be complete in less than one minute. Disintegration time can be determined following the methodology described in the USP document in Annex 4, which also describes all the specifications of the apparatus necessary for this test and presents schematic descriptions of its dimensions\n【41】 - For uncoated ts, the test is carried out as follow:\n【42】 1 dosage unit is placed in each of the six tubes of the disintegration apparatus, using water at 37 °C ± 2 ºC; After one minute, the basket is lifted from the water and the ts are observed;\n【43】 - All six ts should disintegrate completely within one minute;\n【44】 - If one or two ts fail to disintegrate completely within one minute, the test should be repeated on an additional 12 ts;\n【45】 - The results of the test are considered satisfactory if not fewer than 16 out of the total of 18 ts tested are disintegrated completely within one minute\n【46】 # Uniformity of content\n【47】 - Dosage forms, such as ts, are evaluated for their uniformity of content -meaning that the amount of active ingredients contained in all ts should be within acceplimits of the average content. The Assay result for the content, determined on a bulked sample of 20 ts , has to be within acceplimits of the labelled claim. The uniformity limits below relate the zinc content in a single t to the average content\n【48】 - In the case of zinc sulfate ts, the uniformity of content is determined by measuring the content of each of 10 individual ts using the titration method of the assay described above. While in the assay, not fewer than 20 ts are powdered, and only a portion of this powder is used to make a zinc sulfate solution; in the uniformity of content test, each t is powdered and used separately to make a solution of zinc sulfate. The content of each t is then estimated using EDTA coloured titration described in section 2.4.1. After titration the amount of zinc in each t should be within + 15% of the average amount of the active ingredient. However, if one individual t deviates by more than + 15%, but is within + 25% of the average amount of the active ingredient, examine a further 20 ts drawn from the same original sample as the first 10 ts. The preparation under test complies only if the amount of zinc found in no more than one out of 30 ts deviates by more than + 15% of the average amount. None should deviate by more than + 25% of the average amount\n【49】 4 Additional specifications for zinc oral solutions\n【50】 - The pH is a measure of the acidity or alkalinity of a solution. A pH value of 7 is considered neutral. Values below 7 indicate acidity, while those higher than 7 indicate alkalinity. The pH of zinc sulfate oral solution should be between 2.5 and 4.5 as specified in the USP monograph. The method to measure the pH of pharmaceutical preparation and the instruments required are described in details in Annex 5. This test is widely used by drug quality control laboratories. The pH is determined by using a suiand properly standardized potentiometric instrument (pH meter) capable of reproducing pH values to 0.02 pH unit using an indicator electrode sensitive to hydrogenion activity. The pH should be measured at temperature of 25 °C ± 2°. The pH meter should be standardized using certified commercial pH buffers with a pH value accurate to 0.01 pH unit. If the pH of zinc solution is outside the range indicated by the monograph, the stability as well as the taste of the product could be affected\n【51】 # Specific gravity\n【52】 - Specific gravity is the heaviness of a substance compared to the same volume of water. The specific gravity of zinc sulfate oral solution is between 1.18 and 1.24 as specified in the USP monograph . The specific gravity of a liquid, unless otherwise stated, is the ratio of the weight of the liquid in air at 25 ºC to that of an equal volume of water at the same temperature. The measurement could be done by weighing the tested liquid and a similar volume of water in a special recipient (like a flask) called a pycnometer at constant temperature\n【53】 - Select a scrupulously clean, dry pycnometer that has been calibrated previously by determining its weight empty and after it is completely filled with recently boiled water whose temperature is maintained at 25 ºC. Subtract the weight of the empty pycnometer from the weight of the pycnometer containing water to obtain the weight of the water at 25 °C ,W w\n【54】 - Adjust the temperature of the liquid to be tested to about 20 ºC, and completely fill the pycnometer with it\n【55】 - Then, adjust the temperature of the filled pycnometer to 25 ºC, and remove any excess of liquid and weigh the filled pycnometer. Subtract the weight of the empty pycnometer from the weight of the filled pycnometer with the tested liquid to obtain the weight of the tested liquid at 25 °C ,W l\n【56】 - The specific gravity of the liquid is determined by dividing the weight of the tested liquid contained in the pycnometer by the weight of water contained in it both determined at 25 ºC:\n【57】 - sp=W l / W w\n【58】 - Acceptability of zinc t and zinc oral solutions\n【59】 # Evaluation of taste masking\n【60】 - Water-soluble zinc salts have a strong bitter metallic after-taste, and children will refuse to take the medicine if this metallic after-taste is not completely masked\n【61】 - However, this organoleptic characteristic of medicines is not a usual specification required by pharmacopoeial monographs, because taste can be assessed only by taking the medicine. A short guide on how to evaluate the taste of a medicine has been published by the European Medicines Agency Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use . This guide can be useful to manufacturers intending to develop zinc products for treatment of diarrhoea in children\n【62】 - During the procurement process, the candidate zinc products ts or oral solutions should be evaluated for taste-masking by having them tasted by mothers and some children to make sure that the taste masking is effective and the zinc products accep Acceptance of the product by mothers first is critical to adherence to treatment by children\n【63】 - Taste masking is often done by adding fruit flavours to the product. The procuring entities should bear in mind, however, that the product will be used by children and the taste of certain fruit would not be accepted by children unfamiliar with that fruit. The flavours or sweeteners must be common to the areas where the product will be used\n【64】 - Procurement agencies must also review data about any taste trials conducted by the manufacturer of the zinc ts or oral solution\n【65】 # Evaluation of acceptability and adherence to treatment\n【66】 - Adherence to the treatment regimen for 10 to 14 days is essential to ensure the full effect of zinc for the prevention and treatment of diarrhoea. However, adherence to treatment can be obtained only if the zinc products promoted for use in the management of diarrhoea are accepto infants and young children. So, it is strongly advised that all zinc products considered for use in the management of diarrhoea be tested for acceptability using a standard methodology. Such a methodology (Annex 8) should allow one to precisely determine the proportion of children receiving zinc for a duration considered satisfactory. As a general guideline, a treatment may be considered to have good acceptability if 80% of the prescribed treatment is taken by at least 70% of the children\n【67】 # Product formulation and production\n【68】 - It is recommended for the management of diarrhoea to use a product containing only zinc. It is especially important not to use zinc formulation also containing iron, because iron may interfere with zinc absorption\n【69】 1 and these data should be available during the procurement\n【70】 # Product registration\n【71】 - Zinc ts and oral solutions should be registered as medicines to be sold over the counter (OTC). Medicine registration procedures and requirements are different from country to country; however, the following are the minimum guarantees a drug regulatory authority should require in order to register zinc t or oral solution:\n【72】 - Certificate showing that the product was manufactured in a GMP facility, Certificate of analysis showing that the product conforms to an appropriate pharmacopoeial monograph, Assurance that the dispersibility, dosage, disintegration time, and masking of the taste are correct, and Complete information about the manufacturing process, the ingredients and their origin, the quality control data, the stability, the packaging, and the labelling that is up to standard\n【73】 - More information on this topic can be found in the document entitled \"Implementing the new recommendation for the management of diarrhoea -Guidelines for policy makers and programme managers\" 2 and on the WHO web page entitled \"Medicines Policy and Standards, Technical Cooperation for Essential Drugs and Traditional Medicine\" at\n【74】 # Inclusionofzincinthe National Essential Medicines List\n【75】 - According to the World Health Organization, essential medicines are \"those that satisfy the primary health care needs of the population\". Zinc sulfate ts and oral solution in 10 mg per unit dosage forms are included in the 14 th Edition of the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines , h t t p : / / w w w. w h o\n【76】 # i n t / e n t i t y / m e d i c i n e s / s e r v i c e s / e x p e r t c o m m i t t e e s / e s s e n t i a l m e d i c i n e s /\n【77】 - It is important to update national EML to include zinc products, as the EML guides the selection of medicines for national procurement and for the standard treatment guidelines (STGs). As most countries have not automatically adopted the new WHO EML that was revised in March 2005 , submission of an application to the national EML committee for the inclusion of the new ORS and zinc will be necessary. It is not necessary to specify the particular salt of zinc in the EML; it is sufficient to mention 10 mg and 20 mg elemental zinc\n【78】 # Post-marketingsurveillanceandadversedrugreaction( ADR)monitoring1\n【79】 - As should be the case when any new medicine is introduced to the country, post-marketing surveillance and adverse drug reaction (ADR) pilot programmes should be put in place. Such programmes will help check the quality of the new product in the market and prevent any widespread harmful reaction to it. A systematic surveillance programme ensures that samples are randomly collected from the market and tested at scheduled intervals by the quality control laboratory in the country. An ADR programme will monitor the safety of the newly introduced medicine. Product labels and package inserts should be checked against those approved for registration. A system of product complaints regarding quality should also be in place\n【80】 # Adverse drug reactions\n【81】 - To date there has been no report of severe adverse reaction from any form of zinc supplementation for the treatment of diarrhoea. Trials have included more than 9,100 children who have participated in efficacy trials in both the placebo and zinc study arms and nearly 12,000 child-years of observation from one large effectiveness trial. The zinc doses have ranged from 5 to 45 mg per day and have been well-tolerated in diverse settings. Trials have found no differences in adverse reactions based on the different zinc salts (sulfate, acetate, and gluconate) used in supplementation trials. Presently, the only reported side effect of zinc supplementation has been vomiting. Of the seven trials that have reported on incidences of vomiting, only two reported more vomiting in the children who received the zinc than in the placebo group. One trial reported higher vomiting in the zinc versus the control group when zinc was given with multiple micronutrients but not when given alone. Copper status has been evaluated in four trials. Three of the four trials did not find a difference in serum copper status after supplementation. One trial did find a significant trend of decreased copper level when comparing zinc supplemented children to non-zinc supplemented children. However, these children were malnourished with persistent diarrhoea at baseline. Overall, there is no substantial evidence of short-term zinc supplementation for diarrhoea management adversely affecting copper status. In addition to trials treating diarrhoea, there have been several trials assessing the efficacy of zinc for the treatment of pneumonia, malaria, measles, and the common cold. Treatments have typically included approximately 20 mg per day for the duration of the illness, which is typically less than two weeks. There have been no serious adverse events linked to zinc supplementation reported in these studies\n【82】 - The human body has efficient homeostatic mechanisms that regulate the absorption and retention of zinc, which decreases the likelihood of toxic build up and adverse effects in the body. Ingesting too much zinc at once can cause gastric distress and the typical signs and symptoms that are often associated with food poisoning. High doses of zinc for long periods of time may lead to a lower concentration of plasma lipoproteins and decrease copper absorption, yet this is easily corrected by adjusting the intake levels of zinc and copper accordingly. There have been only a few reported cases of adverse effects due to excessive zinc intake. The majority of these cases occurred in adults who knowingly ingested many times a normal daily dose of zinc over a long period of time. Even in the most extreme cases of more than 1 gram of zinc taken daily for many months, the majority of patients recovered from all signs and symptoms, including fatigue, gastrointestinal discomfort, and anaemia as soon as zinc intake was decreased and serum zinc returned to within normal range. In a report by the WHO Collaborating Centre for International Drug Monitoring in Uppsala, Sweden, there was only 1 reported case in a child where the likelihood of causation by zinc was \"certain\" (side effect: epistaxis). There were only 4 reports of possible adverse responses to zinc ingestion among children less than 10 years of age\n【83】 # Reporting of adverse drug reactions\n【84】 - Despite the absence of serious adverse effects linked to the use of the new ORS or to the use of zinc in the literature, once treatment becomes more widespread, mechanisms should be in place for active reporting of adverse events associated with their use. This may be ensured by the establishment of a regular reporting system through the health facilities and/or through special studies. This system for monitoring adverse events must be developed within the systems for monitoring adverse events for other medicines. Forms for recording adverse events should be provided to the health facilities. At each level of the health system, a point person must be appointed to collate the data, and a system for reporting back to the central level should be developed\n【85】 - Reporting quality and safety data to international bodies, e.g., WHO, UNICEF, and others, will both help other countries and establish a history of the new zinc dosage forms\n【86】 # Quality assurance for the procurement of zinc ts and oral solutions 1\n【87】 - While good procurement practices are the first line of defence in assuring the quality of medicines used in the country, product quality surveillance must be integrated at all levels of the health system to ensure that zinc oral solutions and/or ts available in the market are of the appropriate quality. A comprehensive system includes ensuring quality during medicine registration, procurement, and distribution through the public and private sectors. It also includes a mechanism for removing from the supply chain any products found to be of inappropriate quality. s 2, 3, and 4 of this document are intended to provide suispecifications for use in situations when quality control testing is required\n【88】 - A model quality assurance system for procurement agencies\n【89】 - Each individual dose of zinc should contain 10 mg or 20 mg of elemental zinc\n【90】 - For oral solutions, the concentration of elemental zinc should be either 10 mg/5 mL or 20 mg/5 mL\n【91】 - For ts, each t should contain either 10 mg or 20 mg of elemental zinc. ts containing 20 mg of elemental zinc should be scored\n【92】 # Type of zinc salt\n【93】 - The zinc salt used to prepare oral solutions or ts for use in the management of diarrhoea should be soluble in water. Therefore, only the following zinc salts should be used:\n【94】 # Type of ts\n【95】 - As the zinc ts will be used in infants and young children, it is essential that the ts be dispersible. This means that the ts should completely disaggregate in less than 60 seconds in 5 mL of tap water or breast milk\n【96】 - Zinc salts have a bad metallic taste that led to the use of zinc as a vomiting agent until the beginning of the twentieth century. To get infants and young children to take zinc ts or zinc oral solution repeatedly every day for 10-14 days, it is essential that this metallic taste be totally masked\n【97】 - ts and oral solutions should be packaged to provide a full treatment of 10-14 daily doses of zinc (i.e., for oral solutions containing 20 mg/5 mL, bottles should contain 50-75 mL of oral solution; for ts, a blister should contain 10-14 ts)\n【98】 # Shelf life\n【99】 - The zinc product should have a shelf life of at least two years.  This test is provided to determine compliance with the limits on Disintegration stated in the individual monographs except where the label states that the ts or capsules are intended for use as troche, or are to be chewed, or are designed as modified-release dosage forms. Determine the type of units under test from the labelling and from observation, and apply the appropriate procedure to 6 or more dosage units\n【100】 - For the purposes of this test, disintegration does not imply complete solution of the unit or even of its active constituent. Complete disintegration is defined as that state in which any residue of the unit, except fragments of insoluble coating or capsule shell, remaining on the screen of the test apparatus is a soft mass having no palpably firm core\n【101】 - The apparatus consists of a basket-rack assembly, a 1000-mL, low-form beaker, 138 to 155 mm in height and having an inside diameter of 97 to 110 mm for the immersion fluid, a thermostatic arrangement for heating the fluid between 35 °C and 39 °C, and a device for raising and lowering the basket in the immersion fluid at a constant frequency rate between 29 and 32 cycles per minute through a distance of not less than 5.3 cm and not more than 5.7 cm. The volume of the fluid in the vessel is such that at the highest point of the upward stroke the wire mesh remains at least 1.5 cm below the surface of the fluid and descends to not less than 2.5 cm from the bottom of the vessel on the downward stroke. The time required for the upward stroke is equal to the time required for the downward stroke, and the change in stroke direction is a smooth transition, rather than an abrupt reversal of motion. The basket-rack assembly moves vertically along its axis. There is no appreciable horizontal motion or movement of the axis from the vertical\n【102】 - Basket-Rack Assembly -The basket-rack assembly consists of six open-ended transparent tubes, each 77.5 + 2.5 mm long and having an inside diameter of 20.7 to 23 mm and a wall 1.0 to 2.8 mm thick; the tubes are held in a vertical position by two plastic plates, each 8.8 to 9.2 cm in diameter and 5 to 8.5 mm in thickness, with six holes, each 22 to 26 mm in diameter, equidistant from the centre of the plate and equally spaced from one another. Attached to the under surface of the lower plate is a woven stainless steel wire cloth, which has a plain square weave with 1.8-to 2.2-mm mesh apertures and with a wire diameter of 0.57 to 0.66 mm. The parts of the apparatus are assembled and rigidly held by means of three bolts passing through the two plastic plates. A suimeans is provided to suspend the basket-rack assembly from the raising and lowering device using a point on its axis\n【103】 - The design of the basket-rack assembly may be varied somewhat, provided the specifications for the glass tubes and the screen mesh size are maintained\n【104】 - Disks -The use of disks is permitted only where specified or allowed in the monograph. If specified in the individual monograph, each tube is provided with a cylindrical disk 9.5 + 0.15 mm thick and 20.7 + 0.15 mm in diameter. The disk is made of a sui, transparent plastic material having a specific gravity of between 1.18 and 1.20. Five parallel 2 ± 0.1 mm holes extend between the ends of the cylinder. One of the holes is centred on the cylindrical axis. The other holes are centred 6 ± 0.2 mm from the axis on imaginary lines perpendicular to the axis and parallel to each other. Four identical trapezoidal-shaped planes are cut into the wall of the cylinder, nearly perpendicular to the ends of the cylinder The trapezoidal shape is symmetrical; its parallel sides coincide with the ends of the cylinder and are parallel to an imaginary line connecting the centres of two adjacent holes 6 mm from the cylindrical axis. The parallel side of the trapezoid on the bottom of the cylinder has a length of 1.6 ± 0.1 mm, and its bottom edges lie at a depth of 1.6 ± 0.1 mm from the cylinder's circumference. The parallel side of the trapezoid on the top of the cylinder has a length of 9.4 + 0.2 mm, and its centre lies at a depth of 2.6 + 0.1 mm from the cylinder's circumference. All surfaces of the disk are smooth. If the use of disks is specified in the individual monograph, add a disk to each tube, and operate the apparatus as directed under Procedure\n【105】 - Uncoated ts -Place 1 dosage unit in each of the six tubes of the basket and, if prescribed, add a disk. Operate the apparatus, using water or the specified medium as the immersion fluid, maintained at 37 + 2 °C. At the end of the time limit specified in the monograph, lift the basket from the fluid, and observe the ts: all of the ts have disintegrated completely. If 1 or 2 ts fail to disintegrate completely, repeat the test on 12 additional ts. The requirement is met if not fewer than 16 of the total of 18 ts tested are disintegrated. For compendial purposes, pH is defined as the value given by a sui, properly standardized, potentiometric instrument (pH meter) capable of reproducing pH values to 0.02 pH unit using an indicator electrode sensitive to hydrogen-ion activity, the glass electrode, and a suireference electrode. The instrument should be capable of sensing the potential across the electrode pair and, for pH standardization purposes, applying an adjuspotential to the circuit by manipulation of \"standardization,\" \"zero,\" \"asymmetry,\" or \"calibration,\" control, and should be able to control the change in millivolts per unit change in pH reading through a \"temperature\" and/or \"slope\" control. Measurements are made at 25 + 2 °C, unless otherwise specified in the individual monograph or herein\n【106】 - The pH scale is defined by the equation:\n【107】 - pH = pHs + ,E -E s / k,\n【108】 - in which E and E s are the measured potentials where the galvanic cell contains the solution under test, represented by pH, and the appropriate Buffer Solution for Standardization, represented by pHs, respectively. The value of k is the change in potential per unit change in pH and is theoretically  volts at any temperature t\n【109】 - It should be emphasized that the definitions of pH, the pH scale, and the values assigned to the Buffer Solutions for Standardization are for the purpose of establishing a practical, operational system so that results may be compared between laboratories. The pH values thus measured do not correspond exactly to those obtained by the definition, pH = -log a H +. So long as the solution being measured is sufficiently similar in composition to the buffer used for standardization, the operational pH corresponds fairly closely to theoretical pH. Although no claim is made with respect to the suitability of the system for measuring hydrogen-ion activity or concentration, the values obtained are closely related to the activity of the hydrogen ion in aqueous solutions\n【110】 - Where a pH meter is standardized by use of an aqueous buffer and then used to measure the \"pH\" of a nonaqueous solution or suspension, the ionization constant of the acid or base, the dielectric constant of the medium, the liquid-junction potential (which may give rise to errors of approximately 1 pH unit), and the hydrogen-ion response of the glass electrode are all changed. For these reasons, the values so obtained with solutions that are only partially aqueous in character can be regarded only as apparent pH values\n【111】 # Buffer Solutionsfor StandardizationofthepH Meter\n【112】 - Buffer Solutions for Standardization are to be prepared as directed in the accompanying  1 Buffer salts of requisite purity can be obtained from the National Institute of Standards and Technology  Commercially available buffer solutions for pH meter standardization, standardized by methods traceable to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), labeled with a pH value accurate to 0.01 pH unit may be used. Solutions prepared from ACS reagent grade materials or other suimaterials, in the stated quantities, may be used provided the pH of the resultant solution is the same as that of the solution prepared from the NIST certified material.  Calcium Hydroxide, saturated at 25 °C-Shake an excess of calcium hydroxide with water, and decant at 25 °C before use. Protect from absorption of carbon dioxide\n【113】 - Because of variations in the nature and operation of the available pH meters, it is not practicable to give universally applicable directions for the potentiometric determinations of pH. The general principles to be followed in carrying out the instructions provided for each instrument by its manufacturer are set forth in the following paragraphs. Examine the electrodes and, if present, the salt bridge prior to use. If necessary, replenish the salt bridge solution, and observe other precautions indicated by the instrument or electrode manufacturer\n【114】 - To standardize the pH meter, select two Buffer Solutions for Standardization whose difference in pH does not exceed 4 units and such that the expected pH of the material under test falls between them. Fill the cell with one of the Buffer Solutions for Standardization at the temperature at which the test material is to be measured. Set the \"temperature\" control at the temperature of the solution, and adjust the calibration control to make the observed pH value identical with that tabulated. Rinse the electrodes and cell with several portions of the second Buffer Solution for Standardization, then fill the cell with it, at the same temperature as the material to be measured. The pH of the second buffer solution is within + 0.07 pH unit of the tabulated value. If a larger deviation is noted, examine the electrodes and, if they are faulty, replace them. Adjust the \"slope\" or \"temperature\" control to make the observed pH value identical with that tabulated. Repeat the standardization until both Buffer Solutions for Standardization give observed pH values within 0.02 pH unit of the tabulated value without further adjustment of the controls. When the system is functioning satisfactorily, rinse the electrodes and cell several times with a few portions of the test material, fill the cell with the test material, and read the pH value. Use carbon dioxide-free water\\. for solution or dilution of test material in pH determinations. In all pH measurements, allow a sufficient time for stabilization\n【115】 - Where approximate pH values suffice, indicators and test papers may be sui Unless otherwise stated in the individual monograph, the specific gravity determination is applicable only to liquids, and, unless otherwise stated, is based on the ratio of the weight of a liquid in air at 25 °C to that of an equal volume of water at the same temperature. Where a temperature is specified in the individual monograph, the specific gravity is the ratio of the weight of the liquid in air at the specified temperature to that of an equal volume of water at the same temperature\n【116】 - When the substance is a solid at 25 °C, determine the specific gravity at the temperature directed in the individual monograph, and  water at 25 °C\n【117】 # Method 1\n【118】 - Procedure -Select a scrupulously clean, dry pycnometer that previously has been calibrated by determining its weight and the weight of recently boiled water contained in it at 25 °C. Adjust the temperature of the liquid to about 20 °C, and fill the pycnometer with it. Adjust the temperature of the filled pycnometer to 25 °C, remove any excess of the liquid, and weigh. Subtract the tare weight of the pycnometer from the filled weight of the pycnometer. When the monograph specified a temperature different from 25 °C, filled pycnometers must be brought to the temperature of the balance before they are weighed. Subtract the tare weight of the pycnometer from the filled weight\n【119】 - The specific gravity of the liquid is the quotient obtained by dividing the weight of the liquid contained in the pycnometer by the weight of the water contained in it, both determined at 25 °C, unless otherwise directed in the individual monograph. Consumer testing is acknowledged as the best population to assess a product. Consumers are regarded as individuals who are pre-screened to be actual users of the product tested with particular interest to product quality. In line with this definition and taking into consideration the sensory differences between adults and children, it is evident that the children as a target population are regarded as the most suipanel for taste assessment of paediatric formulations\n【120】 # Quantitative evaluation of the taste on the basis of analytical methods\n【121】 - The analytical method utilized is very similar to that for determination of the drug release and is mainly based on the detection of drug substance within a short period of time in aqueous medium (e.g., artificial saliva). It is regarded as an indirect method for assessing taste masking since it does not contribute in the evaluation of taste and sweetness of the drug product. It is commonly used for measuring the effectiveness of coating and complexation within formulation. Taste masking is achieved when in the frame of 1-2 min drug substance is either not detected or the detected amount is below the threshold for identifying its bad taste\n【122】 - Quantitative evaluation of the taste using a taste sensor\n【123】 - The taste sensor (electronic tongue, e-tongue) can detect taste in a manner similar to human gustatory sensation. Taste substances cause changes in electric charge density of the lipid/polymer membrane surface and/or ion distribution near the surface of the membrane of the sensor. The total electric change is given as the response membrane electric potential for the substance tested\n【124】 # Qualitative evaluation of the taste by a taste panel\n【125】 - Consumer testing is acknowledged as the best population to assess a product. Consumers are regarded as individuals who are pre-screened to be actual users of the product tested with particular interest to product quality. In line with this definition and taking into consideration the sensory differences between adults and children, it is evident that the children as a target population are regarded as the most suipanel for taste assessment of paediatric formulations\n【126】 # Recommendations for performing taste trials in children\n【127】 - To design a palatability study in children the following parameters need to be considered as key elements:\n【128】 - The test should be short in order to match children's attention span\n【129】 - As children are easily distracted, the test has to be intrinsically motivating and \"fun\" to do\n【130】 - The procedure has to be as easy as possible so that even very young children (e.g., preschoolers) could understand it\n【131】 - In order to ensure reliable assessment preventing confusion by the children and taste fatigue, the number of variants to be tested should be limited to a maximum of four\n【132】 - Palatability studies are not described in any regulatory guidance but must be considered as clinical studies performed by qualified personnel with Ethical Committee approval and informed consent from parents or guardians and assent from the child as appropriate. There may be ethical difficulties in designing suisafe studies in which children can easily participate\n【133】 # Participation and test performance\n【134】 - Generally, children aged 4 years and older are considered to be able to participate in taste trials. Younger children are very often shy and reluctant. Furthermore, their ability to understand and follow the guidance is sometimes limited; they also lose their interest or have difficulty concentrating during the entire testing period. The failure rate varies up to 50% depending on the design and duration of the test. In addition, they are often unable to communicate their feeling and preferences  would be inappropriate due to the unpleasant sweet taste or the bitter aftertaste. Procedures to remove the previous taste may include repeated rinsing of the mouth, eating of salty crackers, and a sufficiently long interval between sessions\n【135】 # Sensory evaluation: affective and analytical testing, and ranking\n【136】 - Probably the most critical item in sensory evaluation is defining the objective i.e., what exactly should be determined. The test objective will determine the type and age of subjects and the methodology to design, conduct, and interpret the study and its outcome\n【137】 - Affective testing includes acceptance/preference testing. Typical questions addressed are \"which sample do you prefer\", \"how much do you like it\", and \"what don't you like\"\n【138】 - Analytical testing requires the use of objective sensory methodologies aiming to determine the characteristics/properties of the test item, without defining acceptance/preference measures. Analytical testing answers questions such as \"which sample is more bitter\" or \"which sample is different\". Analytical methods help define the sensory properties of the medicinal product preparation and differentiate between variants but will not directly predict how much a variant will be liked. It is often used as a technical tool to support development/optimization purposes\n【139】 - Ranking is a very straightforward method that can be used for preference or analytical assessment (\"please rank samples in order of your personal preference\" or \"please rank samples in increasing order of bitterness\", respectively). The advantage of this method is its simple procedure. However, the study results may be biased due to limited memory and attention of the tester during the entire testing period. This limitation may be more pronounced depending on the age of the subjects participating\n【140】 # Evaluation principles\n【141】 - In most cases smell, texture, taste, and aftertaste, and sometimes also appearance (e.g., if coloured) are addressed. The language used in the questionnaire has to be simple, intelligible, and plain for all participants independent of their age, social skills, and developmental level. It is recommended to utilize commonly used terms relevant to the age of the participants to describe these properties: sweet, salty, sour, and bitter characterizing the taste thin, thick, viscous, gritty aiming to portray the texture of the testing item sweet, salty, sour, and bitter but also astringent, numbness, or freshness for the aftertaste\n【142】 - The following two principles for taste evaluation are established in palatability studies with children: verbal judgment and facial hedonic scale\n【143】 - Verbal judgement followed by scoring in a scale of e.g., 1 to 5 (score 1 corresponds to very good and score 5 to very bad) facilitates the statistical evaluation of the data obtained  While the facial hedonic scale allows the expression of preferences using a pictorial scale\n【144】 - Children below 5-6 years are not considered to be able to express differences in taste perception by use of the preferential method. A reliable estimation of differences particularly in this age group (< 5 years) might be achieved using the child's own spontaneous verbal judgements following a control question. The facial hedonic scale can not be used solely to discriminate between the tastes of tested formulations in the lowest age group. Young children may link the s with things other than taste (e.g., happy face = I will not stay longer in hospital, sad face = pain or discomfort). Facial expressions and behaviour pattern of the subject itself (wry faces, shrug shoulders, vomit, or spit the formulation out) may also reflect the acceptance of the tested formulation . In order to assure reliable outcome of a palatability study with young children it is suggested to involve parents, guardians, or health providers in the study, asking about any discomfort or other observations in relation to the acceptance of the study medicine. Since older children judge more critically than younger ones, they are able to discriminate between the formulations using both the verbal judgment and hedonic scale. Independent of the age of the children and the evaluation principle selected, it is suggested to include in the questionnaire concluding questions to the overall taste evaluation of the formulation such as \"which formulation was the best\" or \"which formulation tasted worst\". Similar approaches may be followed for the assessment of the flavour used: \"which of the tested flavours did you like the most\" or \"which one did you dislike the most\"\n【145】 - Test solution -Dissolve a portion of powdered ts in water to obtain a solution containing about 0.05g of zinc sulfate per mL. Glycerine Solution -a mixture of glycerine and water (85:15). Sodium Sulfide Solution -Dissolve 12 g of sodium sulfide with heating in 45 mL of a mixture of water and glycerine solution (10:29), allow to cool, and dilute to 100 mL with the same mixture of solvents. The solution should be colourless\n【146】 # Hydrochloric Acid Solution\n【147】 - Transfer 20g of hydrochloric acid to a 100-mL volumetric flask and dilute to volume with water and mix. Barium Chloride Solution -Transfer 61 g of barium chloride to a 1000-mL volumetric flask, dissolve in water, and dilute to volume with the same solvent and mix. Sodium Hydroxide Solution -Transfer 42 g of sodium hydroxide to a 100-mL volumetric flask, and dilute to volume with water and mix. Ammonium Chloride Solution -Transfer 107 g of ammonium chloride to a 1000-mL volumetric flask, and dilute to volume with water and mix\n【148】 - A: To 5 mL of the Test solution add 1 mL of Hydrochloric Acid Solution and 1 mL of Barium Chloride Solution. A white precipitate is formed. Acceptability tests must be considered as clinical studies performed by qualified personnel with Ethical Committee approval and informed consent from parents or guardians\n【149】 - This acceptability studies should be conducted in communities, in children with acute diarrhoea, who have been prescribed dispersible zinc t (one 20-mg t per day for 10 days). Blister packs of zinc ts are given to selected drug-sellers and healthcare providers in the community. A visit to the home of the children prescribed zinc dispersible ts is arranged 2 weeks after to assess acceptability of and adherence to the instructions for zinc treatment\n【150】 - The study population should include children aged 3-59 months with an acute diarrhoea episode, whose caretakers sought assistance from one of the selected drug-sellers or healthcare providers and are provided with the zinc blister pack\n【151】 # Sample size\n【152】 - To identify a ± 7.5% minimal difference in acceptability between children aged over and below 18 months with an anticipated 70% acceptability (p), setting the level of confidence at 95% (z = 1.95), the resulting sample size estimate is 140 children per group. To adjust for potential drop-outs, it is necessary to add 10 children in each group, for a final target sample of 300 children (150 in each age-group)\n【153】 - The definitions used for acceptability and adherence are: Acceptability: Acceptability is measured on the basis of a caretaker's report of his/her child's behaviour when given the medicine. The caretakers are asked about their perception of taste of the zinc t given to their children compared to other medicines. The response options are better, same, or worse than other medicines\n【154】 - Adherence is defined in relation to the dose given, frequency of daily administration, duration of treatment, and preparation (dispersion) of the ts", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": "缺少换行#0#0# of contents Introduction小标题另起一行\n多余空格#75#75#h t t p : / / w w w. w h o\n多余空格#76#76# i n t / e n t i t y / m e d i c i n e s / s e r v i c e s / e x p e r t c o m m i t t e e s / e s s e n t i a l m e d i c i n e s /\n", "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-15 17:51:29", "update_time": "2024-04-15 21:55:38"}

Impairment of host defense mechanisms leads to development of the fungus within the human body. The causative agents of mucormycosis include fungi from the phylum Zygomycota, which includes the sub-phylums Mucorales and Entomophthorales. Mucorales subphylum contains the main agents causing mucormycosis. Clark, in 1968, supported use of the term “mucormycosis” for the diseases caused by species of Mucorales, to distinguish them from “subcutaneous phycomycosis” caused by fungi belonging to Entomophthorales. Species of Mucorales are distributed worldwide. The pathogenic species of Mucorales cause an acute angioinvasive infection mainly in immunocompromised patients. Mucormycosis may involve various organ systems including brain, lungs, skin, GIT, bones, liver, spleen and can be classified based on the organ system involvement. Disseminated infection is associated with high mortality. The prognosis of mucormycosis is poor and has varied mortality rates depending on its form and severity. In the rhinocerebral form, the mortality rate is between 30% and 70%, whereas disseminated mucormycosis presents with the highest mortality rate in an otherwise healthy patient with a mortality rate of up to 100%. An established criteria exists which can help in diagnosing mucormycosis. Prompt amphotericin B therapy should be administered due to the rapid spread and mortality rate of the disease. Amphotericin B (which works by damaging the cell walls of the fungi) is usually administered for a further 4-6 weeks after initial therapy begins to ensure eradication of the infection. Posaconazole has been shown to be effective against mucormycosis. Surgical therapy can be very drastic for mucormycosis, and in some cases of rhinocerebral disease removal of infected brain tissue may be required. If we reduce the risk factors, the chance of getting the disease is decreased significantly. Posaconazole has been found to be an effective agent for secondary prevention of mucormycosis\n【3】 # Historical Perspective\n【4】 - Mucormycosis in humans was was first reported in 1885 by a German pathologoist named Paltauf. Since its discovery, it has been known to be a lethal infection that mainly affects immune compromised and debilitated individuals. Recently, there has been an increase in its incidence across the world possibly due to increased incidence of diabetes, which is a major risk factor for development of the disease. Diagnosing mucormycosis has been a challenge since its discovery and early diagnosis is one of the keys to successful treatment. Much needs to be done regarding the early diagnosis and optimal treatment for this lethal infection. Thrombosis with eventual necrosis is the end point in mucormycosis infection. Patient history is an important part of the diagnosis and aids in ruling out other differentials\n【5】 # Classification\n【6】 - Mucormycosis may involve various organ systems including brain, lungs, skin, GIT, bones, liver, spleen and can be classified based on the organ system involvement. Disseminated infection is associated with high mortality\n【7】 # Pathophysiology\n【8】 - Mucormycosis is a fatal fungal infection usually occurring  in immunocompromisedand diabetic patients. Impairment of host defense mechanisms leads to development of the fungus within the human body. Iron is important for growth of the mucorales fungus. Thrombosis with eventual necrosis is the end point in mucormycosis infection. Glucose regulated protein 78 receptor plays a vital part in helping the organism attach to endothelial cells and for subsequent vascular invasion and dissemination. On microscopic examination the hyphae of mucorales is found to have few septations, non-pigmented and branches at right angle\n【9】 # Causes\n【10】 - Rhizopus and mucor species are by far the most common causes of mucormycosis but there may be other fungi that lead to development of the disease\n【11】 # Differentiating mucormycosis from other diseases\n【12】 - Mucormycosis can be difficult to diagnose and a high degree of clinical suspicion is required. Mucormycosis should be differentiated from diseases like invasive aspergillosis, orbital cellulitis, extra nodal T cell lymphoma and cutaneous anthrax. Patient history is an important part of the diagnosis and aids in ruling out other differentials. Other features which help differentiate conditions with similar presentations are radiological and histopathological appearance\n【13】 # Epidemiology and Demographics\n【14】 - Mucormycosis has limited data which outlines the epidemiology and demographics of the disease. Mucormycosis has a high case-fatality rate\n【15】 # Risk Factors\n【16】 - Mucormycosis is most prevalent in immunocompromised individuals (such  as HIV/AIDS, the elderly and SCID) and patients in acidosis (diabetes, burns). Mucormycosis is seen particularly after barrier injury to the skin or mucus membranes, malignancies such as lymphomas and leukemias, renal failure, organ transplant, long term corticosteroid and immunosuppressive therapy, cirrhosis, burns and energy malnutrition. Almost 50-75% of patients diagnosed with mucormycosis are estimated to have underlying poorly controlled diabetes mellitus and ketoacidosis\n【17】 # Screening\n【18】 - There are no screening recommendations for mucormycosis\n【19】 # Natural History, Complications and Prognosis\n【20】 - The possible complications of mucormycosis include the partial loss of neurological function, blindness and clotting of brain or lung vessels. In most cases, the prognosis of mucormycosis is poor and has varied mortality rates depending on its form and severity. In the rhinocerebral form, the mortality rate is between 30% and 70%, whereas disseminated mucormycosis presents with the highest mortality rate in an otherwise healthy patient with a mortality rate of up to 100%. Patients with AIDS have a mortality rate of almost 100%\n【21】 # Diagnosis\n【22】 - An established criteria exists which can help in diagnosing mucormycosis. The criteria is provided by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Invasive Fungal Infections Cooperative Group and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Mycoses Study Group (EORTC/MSG) Consensus Group. The criteria for diagnosis is based on microscopic findings, clinical features and the characteristics of the fungus\n【23】 ## History and Symptoms\n【24】 - Signs and symptoms of mucormycosis differ according to the organ system involved. Severe infection of the facial sinuses, which may extend into the brain, is the most common presentation leading to proptosis, redness of skin above sinuses, mental status changes, dark scabbing in nasal cavities, fever and headache. Pulmonary mucormycosis may lead to development of cough, hemoptysis with or without chest pain and fever. Gastrointestinal mucormycosis can present as abdominal pain, hematemesis, diarrhea or constipation\n【25】 ## Physical Examination\n【26】 - Patients with mucormycosis usually appear lethargic, weak and debilitated owing to its development in immune compromised patients. Physical examination of patients with mucormycosis is usually remarkable for skin necrosis with a black eschar, fever, chills, myalgias, sore throat, non-productive cough and abdominal pain\n【27】 ## Laboratory Findings\n【28】 - Biopsy with H&E staining of the specimen and PCR may confirm the diagnosis in suspected cases. Laboratory findings are taken into account in the presence of clinical suspicion of An early diagnostic procedure performed within 16 days from the onset of symptom and early initiation of antifungal therapy will lead to successful management of this highly fatal disease\n【29】 ## Chest X-ray\n【30】 - Chest xray in pulmonary mucormycosis may show cavitation, hilar adenopathy, pleural effusion, lobar or multi-nodular consolidation and nodules\n【31】 # CTscan Findings\n【32】 - CT scan should be done immediately if mucormycosis is suspected because it can help in delineating the extent of the disease. In rhinocerebral disease, the lesions are isodense to muscle and bone with a rim of soft tissue thickness around the paranasal sinuses if there is sinus involvement. There may be air fluid levels or complete sinus opacification. The reverse halo sign is an important radiographic finding on CT scan which indicates vascular invasion\n【33】 # MRI Findings\n【34】 - MRI in mucormycosis tends to show isotense or hypointense in all sequences. The black turbinate sign is an important finding in rhinocerebral involvement\n【35】 # Other Imaging Findings\n【36】 - There are no other specific imaging findings for mucormycosis\n【37】 # Other Diagnostic Studes\n【38】 - There are no additional diagnostic findings for mucormycosis\n【39】 # Treatment\n【40】 ## Medical Therapy\n【41】 - If mucormycosis is suspected, prompt amphotericin B therapy should be administered due to the rapid spread and mortality rate of the disease. Amphotericin B (which works by damaging the cell walls of the fungi) is usually administered for a further 4-6 weeks after initial therapy begins to ensure eradication of the infection. Posaconazole has been shown to be effective against mucormycosis, perhaps more so than amphotericin B, but has not yet replaced it as the standard of care. After administration the patient must then be admitted for surgery for removal of the \"fungus ball\"\n【42】 ## Surgery\n【43】 - Surgical therapy can be very extensive for mucormycosis, and in some cases of rhinocerebral disease removal of infected brain tissue may be required. In some cases surgery may be disfiguring because it may involve removal of the palate, nasal cavity, or eye structures. Surgery may be extended to more than one operation. It has been hypothesized that hyperbaric oxygen may be beneficial as an adjunctive therapy because higher oxygen pressure increases the ability of neutrophils to kill the organism\n【44】 ## Primary Prevention\n【45】 - Mucormycosis may be prevented by avoiding the conditions leading to its development. If we reduce the risk factors, the chance of getting the disease is decreased significantly\n【46】 ## Secondary Prevention\n【47】 - Posaconazole has been found to be an effective agent for secondary prevention of mucormycosis", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": "", "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-15 17:51:29", "update_time": "2024-04-15 19:40:20"}

People having treatment outside this recommendation may continue without change to the funding arrangements in place for them before this guidance was published, until they and their NHS clinician consider it appropriate to stop\n【12】 - Why the committee made these recommendations\n【13】 - Guselkumab is proposed as an alternative to other biological therapies already recommended by NICE for treating severe plaque psoriasis in adults. Evidence from clinical trials and indirect comparisons show that guselkumab is more effective than TNF‑alpha inhibitors (that is, adalimumab, etanercept and infliximab) and ustekinumab. It also suggests that guselkumab is likely to provide similar health benefits to ixekizumab and secukinumab\n【14】 - For the cost comparison, it is appropriate to compare guselkumab with ixekizumab and secukinumab. Taking into account how many people continue treatment (which affects the cost to the NHS), guselkumab provides similar health benefits to ixekizumab and secukinumab at a similar or lower cost. It is therefore recommended as an option for treating plaque psoriasis in the NHS.# Information about guselkumab\n【15】 # Marketing authorisation\n【16】 - Guselkumab (Tremfya, Janssen) is indicated for 'the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy'\n【17】 # Dosage in the marketing authorisation\n【18】 - The recommended dosage of guselkumab is 100 mg by subcutaneous injection at weeks 0 and 4, followed by a 100 mg maintenance dose every 8 weeks. Consideration should be given to stopping treatment in people whose disease has shown no response after 16 weeks of treatment\n【19】 - The list price of guselkumab is £2,250 per prefilled syringe (excluding VAT; British national formulary online; accessed March 2018). The company has a commercial arrangement. This makes guselkumab available to the NHS with a discount. The size of the discount is commercial in confidence. It is the company's responsibility to let relevant NHS organisations know details of the discount.# Committee discussion\n【20】 # Decision problem\n【21】 ## The company's decision problem is relevant to clinical practice\n【22】 - The company proposed that guselkumab should be considered as an alternative to other biological therapies for psoriasis in adults when non-biological systemic treatment or phototherapy is inadequately effective, not tolerated or contraindicated. The committee understood that the company's proposed decision problem was narrower than guselkumab's marketing authorisation. However, it agreed that the proposed population was consistent with previous NICE recommendations for biologicals for psoriasis, and with their use in clinical practice. The committee noted that the company presented comparisons with NICE-recommended biologicals, and considered that this was consistent with the criteria for a cost-comparison appraisal (the appropriateness of specific comparators is discussed in section 3.7). The committee recalled that previous technology appraisal guidance recommendations specified that treatment should stop if there is an inadequate response after induction. An adequate response is defined as:\n【23】 - a 75% reduction in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score (PASI 75) from when treatment started or\n【24】 - a 50% reduction in the PASI score (PASI 50) and a 5‑point reduction in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) from when treatment started.The committee considered that it would be reasonable to consider a similar approach for this appraisal. It accepted that the company's positioning reflected the likely place of guselkumab in clinical practice, and concluded that the company's decision problem was relevant to clinical practice\n【25】 # Clinical effectiveness\n【26】 ## Guselkumab is more effective than adalimumab\n【27】 - Guselkumab has been studied in 3 randomised controlled trials including a total of 2,096 adults with plaque psoriasis. It was directly compared with adalimumab in 2 trials, VOYAGE‑1 and VOYAGE‑2. In these trials, guselkumab was associated with statistically significant improvements compared with adalimumab in primary and secondary outcomes, including PASI response rates. The committee noted, in particular, that patients randomised to guselkumab were statistically significantly more likely to have a PASI 75 response after induction (that is, at week 16) compared with adalimumab (VOYAGE‑1: PASI 75 response rates 91.2% and 73.1% respectively, p<0.001). The committee accepted that the results of the VOYAGE trials showed that guselkumab was more effective than adalimumab\n【28】 ## The company's network meta-analysis is suifor decision-making\n【29】 - The company's network meta-analysis compared guselkumab with adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab, ixekizumab, secukinumab and ustekinumab, using data from 45 trials. It understood that the ERG preferred the analyses based only on comparators specified in the decision problem (termed the 'restricted analyses') because these matched the scope. The committee accepted the ERG's view and concluded that the network meta-analysis provided by the company was suifor decision-making\n【30】 ## Guselkumab provides greater benefits than TNF‑alpha inhibitors and ustekinumab, and similar benefits to secukinumab and ixekizumab\n【31】 - The committee noted that the results of the network meta-analysis suggested that guselkumab was statistically significantly more effective, in terms of PASI 75 response, than the TNF‑alpha inhibitors (that is, adalimumab, etanercept and infliximab) and ustekinumab. It considered that guselkumab would provide substantial clinical benefits over adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab and ustekinumab in practice. It also considered that, although guselkumab appeared to be statistically significantly better than secukinumab in terms of PASI 75 response in the network meta-analysis, the difference might not be clinically meaningful. The committee also noted that guselkumab was similarly effective to ixekizumab in this outcome, and that no statistically significant difference was seen. It therefore considered that guselkumab was likely to provide similar benefits to secukinumab and ixekizumab in clinical practice. The committee acknowledged that PASI 75 is a key outcome for informing treatment continuation after induction. However, it also understood that patients are interested in having complete clearance of their psoriasis symptoms so it considered that PASI 100 is also a relevant outcome. The committee appreciated that the company analyses also covered a range of outcomes, and that the results for PASI 100 were broadly consistent with those for PASI 75. The committee noted the safety and tolerability outcomes in the company's network meta-analysis and considered that guselkumab had a similar safety profile to other biologicals, regardless of treatment class. It concluded that guselkumab provides substantially greater clinical benefits compared with adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab and ustekinumab, and is likely to provide similar benefits to secukinumab and ixekizumab\n【32】 # Cost comparison\n【33】 # Thecommitteeprefersthecost-comparisonanalysisprovidedbythe ERG\n【34】 - The company presented a cost-comparison analysis that modelled the total costs of guselkumab, adalimumab and ustekinumab treatment over 5 years. It took into account stopping treatment after induction (based on PASI 75 response rates, which was consistent with the stopping rules specified in NICE technology appraisal guidance for the comparators), using an assumption that guselkumab and the comparators were similarly effective (that is, it assumed clinical similarity between treatments). The analysis also took into account the long-term stopping of treatment during maintenance therapy. The committee noted the ERG's view that assuming similar effectiveness was inappropriate because of the statistically significant differences between treatments in clinical effectiveness. Therefore, the ERG presented exploratory analyses either using the company's assumption of clinical similarity, or using different treatment continuation rates for each treatment based on PASI 75 response rates from the network meta-analysis . These exploratory analyses included all biologicals and used a 10‑year time horizon. The committee appreciated that guselkumab is statistically significantly more effective than some other subcutaneous biological treatments . It was aware that differences in effectiveness led to differences in the number of people stopping treatment after induction, resulting in differences in treatment duration between therapies and hence differences in costs to the NHS. It considered that treatment duration should be taken into account in a cost-comparison analysis when it is directly affected by clinical effectiveness, and that when there is a difference in effectiveness between guselkumab and a comparator, different continuation rates should be used. The committee therefore concluded that the ERG's cost-comparison analysis was preferable for decision-making\n【35】 ## Secukinumab and ixekizumab are the relevant comparators for cost comparison\n【36】 - For comparators in its base case, the company focused on adalimumab and ustekinumab. The committee understood that the company chose these because they are the most frequently used biologicals for psoriasis, and accepted this rationale. However, it recalled the statistically and clinically significant increased benefits for guselkumab compared with adalimumab and ustekinumab , and that such increased benefits affected the cost comparison . It noted that, in the ERG's analysis, guselkumab was more expensive than adalimumab and ustekinumab. The committee also noted that, when a technology provides greater benefits than a comparator but at a greater cost, it is not possible to reach a conclusion using cost-comparison methods. It therefore concluded that adalimumab and ustekinumab were not accepcomparators to focus on in a cost-comparison context. Conversely, the committee recognised that, because guselkumab, ixekizumab and secukinumab are likely to provide similar clinical benefits , it was possible to reach a recommendation using cost-comparison methods by considering the comparison of guselkumab with secukinumab and ixekizumab. It noted that secukinumab has a rapidly growing market share, and that ixekizumab is expected to be used more frequently over time. The committee concluded that ixekizumab and secukinumab, not adalimumab and ustekinumab, were the relevant comparators for the cost-comparison analysis\n【37】 ## Guselkumab meets the criteria to be recommended using cost comparison\n【38】 - The committee focused on the cost comparison with ixekizumab and secukinumab using the ERG's exploratory analyses  and taking into account all confidential patient access schemes. In these analyses, the total costs associated with guselkumab were similar to or lower than those associated with ixekizumab and secukinumab (the exact results cannot be reported here because the discounts are confidential). The committee concluded that the criteria for a positive cost comparison were met because:\n【39】 - guselkumab provided similar overall health benefits to ixekizumab and secukinumab and the total costs associated with guselkumab were similar to or lower than the total costs associated with ixekizumab and secukinumab.The committee therefore recommended guselkumab as an option for treating plaque psoriasis in adults. It concluded that the recommendations for guselkumab should be consistent with the company's proposal and the NICE recommendations for ixekizumab and secukinumab, that is:\n【40】 - for people with severe disease (a PASI of 10 or more and a DLQI of more than 10) and when the disease has not responded to standard systemic therapies or when these treatments are unsui- when the disease has not responded to standard systemic therapies or when these treatments are unsui\n【41】 # The PASIand DLQImaynotbeappropriateforallpeoplewithpsoriasis\n【42】 - The committee noted, as in previous NICE technology appraisals on psoriasis, potential equality issues:\n【43】 - the PASI might underestimate disease severity in people with darker skin\n【44】 - the DLQI has limited validity in some people, and may miss anxiety and depression.The committee concluded that, when using the PASI, healthcare professionals should take into account skin colour and how this could affect the PASI score, and make the clinical adjustments they consider appropriate. Also, it concluded that, when using the DLQI, healthcare professionals should take into account any physical, psychological, sensory or learning disabilities, or communication difficulties, that could affect the responses to the DLQI and make any adjustments they consider appropriate", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-15 17:51:29", "update_time": "2024-04-15 18:32:39"}

Dick novel, A Scanner Darkly\n【2】 # Compositionof Substance D\n【3】 - Not much is said about the drug's chemical makeup, except that it is synthesised in a laboratory in an unknown location.  It is derived from a small, blue flower grown primarily in the Anaheim, California area in a large produce farm. Substance D can be cut with meth, cocaine, or seemingly any stimulant drug. ,\n【4】 # Effectsof Substance D\n【5】 - If taken in large enough amounts (and in a high enough frequency) Substance D can cause hallucinations, paranoia (if taken in in increased levels) psychosis (permanent, usually; exempli gratia: Charles Freck , Jerry Fabin ) and, in a few cases, death (hence its street name). ,\n【6】 - It is implied multiple times in Dick's novel that Substance D induces lethargy, indicating that Substance D is not a stimulant.  As is shown in the novel when Freck's ability to operate a car properly was hindered, Substance D apparently also impairs one's judgement (much like grain alcohol). ,\n【7】 - All throughout the novel, it is shown that long-term use of Substance D causes the two cerebral hemispheres of the brain to separate.  \"Death\" also inhibits the ability of the two halves of the brain to 'communicate' with each other.  This splitting of the brain (literally, right down the middle) ultimately causes a form of drug-induced Dissociative identity disorder (DID).  The main character in the novel, Robert Arctor (played by Keanu Reeves in the 2006 film), had his mind divided into one side that became \"Bob Arctor\" and the other side that became Fred (his identity as an undercover narc in the Anaheim Police Force)\n【8】 # Peoplewhouse Substance D\n【9】 - Those who regularly use Substance D (which appears to be most of Anaheim, California) are referred to as heads.  Those who don't, the users and addicts call straights. ,\n【10】 - Philip K. Dick seems to separate the \"straights\" from the \"heads,\" but makes it very nebulous as to who is dealing the drug.  According to the novel's assertion of it, the straights don't use Substance D, but may deal it, and the heads don't usually deal, but they do use it (and buy from other heads or even straights)\n【11】 # Thelegalityof Substance D\n【12】 - Substance D is illegal for anyone to have and/or sell, but not to produce.  This is evidenced by the fact that the California Police will set up an undercover sting operation to catch the dealers and those who possess it, but never go after the lab that manufactures it or the company that runs the lab\n【13】 - Dick also mentions in A Scanner Darkly that the police don't often arrest \"small-time local dealer,\" such as Donna Hawthorne (played by Winona Ryder in the 2006 film).   However, despite all this, the police will \" such persons automatically.\"\n【14】 - From the character of Charles Freck's view-point, California is a \"fascist police state.\"\n【15】 # Formsinwhich Substance Dissold\n【16】 - Substance D is sold in the following forms:\n【17】 \"Tabs\" ts\n【18】 - Liquid (for injection, via hypodermic needle)\n【19】 - Substance D (in the book) is only bought over the phone (called \"buy calls\") by way of a payphone, since the California Police bug everyone's phone lines\n【20】 - One would call their dealer to arrange a meeting-spot to buy the drug, but even the pay phones are tapped\n【21】 - In the film, Substance D is purchased in the same way, only with a cellular phone (since the film was set in the year 2013; the book was set in 1994).

Hepatitis B virus is transmitted by sexual contact, through the use of infected blood and blood products, by reuse of contaminated needles and syringes, by vertical transmission from mother to child during, or soon after, birth, and by horizontal transmission among children. The risk of chronic infection with hepatitis B virus depends on the nature of the immune response to the initial infection. This varies according to the age at which the infection is acquired. Almost 100% of neonates, and about 50% of young children, develop chronic hepatitis B if infected with hepatitis B virus. In contrast, only about 2–10% of people who are infected as adults go on to develop chronic hepatitis B\n【9】 - The Department of Health estimates that about 180,000 people in the UK have chronic hepatitis B. There are about 7700 new cases of chronic hepatitis B each year. Of these, around 300 people were infected within the UK; the remainder (mainly immigrants to the UK) were infected abroad, generally in areas of high prevalence where the virus is frequently transmitted from mother to child\n【10】 - People with active chronic hepatitis B are at increased risk of liver cirrhosis (scarring of the liver tissue that may progress to liver failure) and primary liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma)\n【11】 - The diagnosis of chronic hepatitis B is based on the presence of well-characterised serological markers in the blood. Hepatitis B viral DNA (HBV DNA) is present in both acute and chronic hepatitis B. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is a viral protein detecin the blood in both acute and chronic infection. Chronic hepatitis B is defined as persistence of HBsAg for 6 months or more after acute infection. Hepatitis B 'e' antigen (HBeAg) is an indicator of viral replication, although some variant forms of the virus do not express HBeAg . Active infection can be described as HBeAg-positive or HBeAg-negative according to whether HBeAg is secreted\n【12】 - The natural history of chronic hepatitis B can be divided into phases, each of which may last many years\n【13】 - Immunotolerant phase.People who are affected at birth or in early childhood initially enter an 'immunotolerant' phase during which the immune system does not actively fight the virus. The virus replicates rapidly during this phase, but the person usually has no symptoms. The person is highly infectious, and may infect other members of the family and community. This phase can last for many years before progressing to active disease\n【14】 - Incubation. The incubation period for hepatitis B infection ranges from 40–160 days, with an average of 60–90 days\n【15】 - Active chronic hepatitis\n【16】 - B.The first stage of active disease involves a period of increasing inflammatory hepatic necrosis as the immune system begins to fight the virus. This stage of the disease is characterised by elevated levels of viral DNA in the blood, persistently raised levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and evidence of hepatic necrosis and inflammation on biopsy. The liver damage caused by infection and inflammation may eventually lead to cirrhosis of the liver. Progression to cirrhosis occurs at an annual rate of 2–5.5%, with a cumulative 5-year rate of progression of 8–20%\n【17】 - HBeAg seroconversion\n【18】 - In people infected with an HBeAg-positive form of the virus, the next stage of the infection occurs when inflammation becomes sufficiently intense to cause lysis of infected hepatocytes. This produces a 'flare' of the disease with symptoms resembling acute hepatitis B, and leads to the development of antibodies against the 'e' antigen. This is referred to as 'HBeAg seroconversion'. The seroconverted disease state is associated with good quality of life and a relatively low risk of disease progression. It is referred to as the 'inactive HBsAg carrier state' because patients continue to express hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). The spontaneous seroconversion rate is 5–10% per year, although this varies among populations. Once seroconversion has taken place, most people remain in the inactive HBsAg carrier state. However, increasing viraemia and recurrent hepatitis after seroconversion indicate the emergence of the HBeAg-negative strain of the virus\n【19】 - HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B\n【20】 - In recent years a form of the virus that does not cause infected cells to secrete HBeAg has been discovered (sometimes called the 'precore mutant' strain). People can be infected with the so-called HBeAg-negative form of the virus from the beginning, or the viral mutation can emerge later in the course of infection in people initially infected with the HBeAg-positive form of the virus. The prevalence of HBeAg-negative hepatitis varies geographically; it is more common in Asia and the Mediterranean region than in Northern Europe. Infection with HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B is associated with a fluctuating course and a poor prognosis. Active disease is associated with either persistent elevation of ALT or an erratic pattern of ALT changes with flare-ups resembling acute hepatitis B that can be severe or even fatal. Few patients with HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B achieve a lasting remission. Progression to cirrhosis of the liver has been estimated to occur in 8-10% of people with HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B each year\n【21】 - HBsAg seroconversion.The development of antibodies against HBsAg, with clearance of HBsAg, occurs spontaneously in about 0.5–2% of people with chronic hepatitis B each year in western countries. In countries where hepatitis B is endemic, the rate is much lower – between 0.05 and 0.08% per year. Clearance of HBsAg is most likely to occur in the year following HBeAg seroconversion. It signifies resolution of the chronic infection. Variants of hepatitis B (known as 'occult hepatitis B') that are not associated with detecHBsAg by current immunoassays have been recognised\n【22】 - The aim of treatment is to prevent progression to cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. Treatment may be given as a finite course (circumscribed therapy) – with the intention of allowing the immune system to respond and control the infection without the need for further drug treatment – or as long-term viral suppressive therapy. Long-term therapy is needed if short-term therapy is unsuccessful\n【23】 - The first drugs to be licensed for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B were alfa interferons. Interferons are natural proteins that activate the immune system in response to viral infection. Three recombinant interferon products have UK marketing authorisation for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B: IntronA (interferon alfa-2b, Schering-Plough), Roferon-A (interferon alfa-2a, Roche) and Viraferon (interferon alfa-2b, Schering-Plough). Interferon alfa-2a is usually given at a dose of 2.5–5 million units per square metre of body surface area by subcutaneous injection three times a week for 4–6 months. Interferon alfa-2b is given at a dose of 5–10 million units three times a week for 4–6 months. The side effects of interferons can be severe and this means that they are not suifor long-term treatment in chronic hepatitis B. Interferons are contraindicated in decompensated liver disease. There are no data on long-term maintenance therapy with an alfa interferon and the treatment is not licensed for this\n【24】 - Lamivudine (Zeffix, GlaxoSmithKline) is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor antiviral drug. The dose in adults is 100 mg per day. It can be given both as a circumscribed course of treatment or as long-term viral suppressive therapy. In HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B, treatment is usually given for a year with the aim of bringing about HBeAg seroconversion. In HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B, a circumscribed course of therapy is less likely to lead to long-term control of the infection, and long-term treatment is often needed. The main problem with long-term antiviral treatment is the emergence of resistance. Resistance to lamivudine occurs in more than 60% of cases after 3 years' treatment.# The technologies\n【25】 # Peginterferon alfa-2a\n【26】 - Peginterferon alfa-2a (Pegasys, Roche) has UK marketing authorisation for the treatment of HBeAg-positive or HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B in adults with compensated liver disease and evidence of viral replication, increased ALT and histologically verified liver inflammation and/or fibrosis. Peginterferons are formed by attaching strands of polyethylene glycol (PEG) to the interferon molecules. This slows the rate of absorption and excretion of interferon, reducing the fluctuations in serum level that occur with unmodified interferon. Peginterferons are administered once a week, compared with three or more times a week for the unmodified form\n【27】 - Peginterferons have a range of adverse effects similar to those of interferons. These include influenza-like symptoms such as fever, chills, myalgias, arthralgias and headache, which are most likely to occur at the start of treatment and seldom require discontinuation of treatment. Depletion of platelets and white blood cells is common. Other adverse effects include depression, anxiety or emotional lability, which may be severe. Cardiovascular adverse effects include hypertension or hypotension, arrhythmias, oedema, myocardial infarction or stroke. Interferons are contraindicated in chronic hepatitis with decompensated cirrhosis of the liver. For full details of side effects and contraindications, see the 'Summary of product characteristics'\n【28】 - A prefilled syringe containing 180 micrograms of peginterferon alfa-2a costs £132.06 (excluding VAT, 'British national formulary', 50th edition ). The usual dose is 180 micrograms once a week. Costs may vary in different settings because of negotiated procurement discounts\n【29】 # Adefovir dipivoxil\n【30】 - Adefovir is structurally related to the purine base adenine. It is converted intracellularly to the diphosphate, which inhibits the synthesis of hepatitis B virus DNA through competition for the enzyme reverse transcriptase and incorporation into the viral DNA. Adefovir is not well absorbed after oral administration so is given by mouth as the prodrug adefovir dipivoxil\n【31】 - Adefovir dipivoxil (Hepsera, Gilead) has UK marketing authorisation for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in adults with:\n【32】 - compensated liver disease with evidence of active viral replication, persistently elevated serum ALT levels and histological evidence of active liver inflammation and fibrosis\n【33】 - decompensated liver disease\n【34】 - The most commonly reported adverse effects for adefovir dipivoxil are gastrointestinal effects including nausea, flatulence, diarrhoea and dyspepsia. Increases in serum creatinine are common but usually mild to moderate. However, cases of renal impairment and acute renal failure have been reported. For full details of side effects and contraindications, see the 'Summary of product characteristics'\n【35】 - A pack containing 30 days' supply of adefovir dipivoxil 10 mg ts costs £315.00 (excluding VAT, 'BNF'50). Costs may vary in different settings because of negotiated procurement discounts.# Evidence and interpretation\n【36】 - The Appraisal Committee (appendix A) considered evidence from a number of sources (appendix B)\n【37】 # Clinical effectiveness\n【38】 ## Peginterferon alfa-2a\n【39】 - The Assessment Group found three randomised controlled trials investigating peginterferon alfa-2a in chronic hepatitis B. Two trials were in people with HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B, and the third was in people with HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B\n【40】 - In HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B, the most useful measure of response is HBeAg loss or seroconversion because this signals transition to the inactive carrier state, which is associated with a relatively benign outcome. The rate of HBeAg seroconversion was reported in both studies of peginterferon alfa-2a in HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B\n【41】 - One trial was an open-label study in which 194 participants were randomised to one of three doses of peginterferon alfa-2a or interferon alfa-2a. Treatment was for 24 weeks, and was followed by 24-weeks' treatment-free follow-up. The rate of HBeAg seroconversion was higher in the patients treated with peginterferon alfa-2a (32% for all three doses combined) than in patients treated with interferon alfa-2a (25%), but the difference was not statistically significant. ALT levels were also more likely to return to the normal range in the people treated with peginterferon alfa-2a (36% for all three doses combined compared with 25% for interferon alfa-2a). This difference was also not statistically significant. The only statistically significant difference between treatment and control in this trial was for the rate of 'combined response', defined as HBeAg loss, HBV DNA normalisation and ALT normalisation (24% for all three treatment doses combined compared with 12% for control, p = 0.036)\n【42】 - The second trial in patients with HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B was a comparison of peginterferon alfa-2a with lamivudine, in which 814 people were randomised to peginterferon alfa-2a plus placebo, peginterferon alfa-2a plus lamivudine, or lamivudine alone. The study was partially double blind in that those who were receiving peginterferon alfa-2a were blinded as to whether they were receiving lamivudine. Treatment was for 48 weeks, and was followed by 24-weeks' treatment-free follow-up. The rate of HBeAg seroconversion at week 72 was significantly higher in the patients treated with peginterferon alfa-2a plus placebo (32%) than in those treated with lamivudine alone (19%), p < 0.001. Addition of lamivudine to peginterferon alfa-2a did not improve the HBeAg seroconversion rate over peginterferon alfa-2a alone: the rate in the group that received both lamivudine and peginterferon alfa-2a was 27%. Normalisation of ALT occurred in a higher proportion of the group taking peginterferon alfa-2a than of the group taking lamivudine alone (41% versus 28%, p = 0.002). Again, adding lamivudine to peginterferon alfa-2a did not improve the response rate for this endpoint (ALT normalisation 39%)\n【43】 - In HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B, a major objective of treatment is suppressing viral replication and preventing progressive liver disease. In clinical trials these outcomes have usually been expressed in terms of decrease in the levels of HBV DNA found in the serum and ALT normalisation\n【44】 - The only study of peginterferon alfa-2a in HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B was a three-way comparison of peginterferon alfa-2a plus placebo, peginterferon alfa-2a plus lamivudine, and lamivudine alone (n = 537). Treatment was for 48 weeks and was followed by 24-weeks' treatment-free follow up (72 weeks in total). The study had two predetermined primary measures of efficacy: the normalisation of ALT levels and the suppression of HBV DNA levels to less than 20,000 copies/ml. At week 72, the percentage with normalised ALT was significantly higher in the groups treated with peginterferon alfa-2a than in the lamivudine group (59% with peginterferon alfa-2a monotherapy and 60% for peginterferon alfa-2a plus lamivudine, versus 44% for lamivudine; p = 0.004 and p = 0.003 respectively). For the outcome of virological response (HBV DNA < 20,000 copies/ml) at week 72, the percentage of patients who had a response was significantly higher in the groups treated with peginterferon alfa-2a than in the lamivudine group (43% for peginterferon alfa-2a monotherapy and 44% for peginterferon alfa-2a plus lamivudine, versus 29% for lamivudine; p = 0.007 and p = 0.003 respectively)\n【45】 - Treatment-resistance mutations were detected in 32 people (18%) in the lamivudine group and one person (< 1%) in the peginterferon alfa-2a plus lamivudine group (p < 0.001)\n【46】 ## Adefovir dipivoxil\n【47】 - The assessment report included five randomised controlled trials of adefovir dipivoxil in chronic hepatitis B. Four of the studies were conducted in people with HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B and one was in people with HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B\n【48】 - The largest study (n = 515) was a comparison of two doses of adefovir dipivoxil (10 mg and 30 mg) with placebo in people with HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B and compensated liver disease. The primary endpoint was histological improvement (defined in terms of a reduction in Knodell necroinflammatory score). Histological improvement was seen in 59% of patients in the adefovir dipivoxil 30 mg group, 53% of patients in the adefovir dipivoxil 10 mg group and 25% of patients in the placebo group (p < 0.001 for both comparisons with placebo). The HBeAg seroconversion rates were 14% for the adefovir dipivoxil 30 mg group, 12% for the adefovir dipivoxil 10 mg group and 6%, for the placebo group. The rates of ALT normalisation were 55% for the 30 mg, 48% for the 10 mg and 16% for the placebo group\n【49】 - Another study (n = 59) investigated adefovir dipivoxil in people with HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B, genotypic evidence of lamivudine-resistance, raised ALT and a serum HBV DNA level of at least 106 copies/ml despite ongoing treatment with lamivudine. The patients were randomised to adefovir dipivoxil 10 mg, lamivudine 100 mg, or the addition of adefovir dipivoxil to ongoing lamivudine treatment. The primary endpoint was time-weighted change from baseline in serum HBV DNA level. Reductions in this endpoint were seen in all recipients of adefovir dipivoxil. HBV DNA levels were 'undetec' (< 1000 copies/ml) in 26% of patients receiving adefovir dipivoxil plus placebo, in 35% of patients receiving adefovir dipivoxil plus lamivudine, and in none of the patients receiving lamivudine plus placebo (p = 0.005). ALT was normalised in 53% of the adefovir dipivoxil plus lamivudine group and 47% of adefovir dipivoxil group, compared with 5% (1/19) of the lamivudine group (p = 0.001 and p = 0.004, respectively)\n【50】 - The remaining two studies in HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B investigated the combination of adefovir dipivoxil with lamivudine compared with lamivudine alone. One was in treatment-naive patients (n = 112) and the other was in patients with lamivudine resistance (n = 94). In the study in treatment-naive patients (which was still ongoing at the time of this appraisal) there was no advantage in adding adefovir dipivoxil to lamivudine at 1 year in terms of virological, serological or biochemical outcome. However, there was a higher incidence of lamivudine-resistance mutations and viral breakthrough in the group that received lamivudine alone. In the other study of patients with lamivudine resistance, adefovir dipivoxil plus lamivudine was more effective than lamivudine alone in terms of both virological and ALT responses. HBV DNA level fell to 105 copies/ml or less in 85% of those taking adefovir dipivoxil plus lamivudine, compared with 11% of patients taking lamivudine alone (p < 0.001). ALT was normalised in 37% of those taking the combined treatment, compared with 9% of those taking lamivudine (p = 0.003)\n【51】 - One study compared adefovir dipivoxil with placebo in people with HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B. This was a double-blind study in which 185 people were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to adefovir dipivoxil or placebo for 48 weeks. The primary endpoint was histological improvement defined in terms of a reduction in Knodell necroinflammatory score with no worsening of fibrosis. A total of 167 patients (91%) had assessable pre-treatment and post-treatment liver biopsy specimens. Significantly more patients had histological improvement in the adefovir dipivoxil group than in the placebo group (64% versus 33%, p < 0.001). At week 48, 51% of the adefovir dipivoxil group had undetecHBV DNA levels (< 400 copies/ml), compared with no one in the placebo group (p < 0.001), and 72% had normalised ALT levels compared with 29% in the placebo group (p < 0.001)\n【52】 - Long-term follow-up data have been published recently. After week 48, 123 people who had been assigned to adefovir dipivoxil in the initial study were randomised to continue adefovir dipivoxil at a dose of 10 mg daily or to switch to placebo. Of the 61 patients who had initially been randomised to placebo, 60 switched to treatment with adefovir dipivoxil 10 mg daily. At week 96, HBV DNA was undetecin 71% of the group continuing with adefovir dipivoxil, compared with 8% of the placebo group. In the group who received adefovir dipivoxil for 48 weeks having previously received placebo for 48 weeks, HBV DNA was undetecin 76% of patients. The cumulative incidence of resistance to adefovir dipivoxil among all patients was 3% at 96 weeks and 5.9% at 144 weeks. This trial will continue until all patients have completed 5 years' follow-up\n【53】 ## Evidence from clinical experts\n【54】 - The Committee heard from the clinical experts that the decision to treat chronic hepatitis B was determined by the degree of fibrosis and/or necroinflammation on liver biopsy, combined with evidence of active viral replication (HBV DNA levels) and the persistent elevation of serum ALT. Treatment was not necessarily indicated for people with minimal elevation of ALT (1.5–2.0 times the upper limit of normal) and low necroinflammatory scores on liver biopsy. However, these people should be carefully monitored because the disease can change rapidly from a quiescent to an active state\n【55】 - The experts expressed concern about the development of viruses with mutations rendering them resistant to antiviral drugs. Lamivudine resistance develops in a high proportion of patients on monotherapy, and could limit the options for future treatment through cross-resistance to related drugs. The experts noted that a strategy of treating chronic hepatitis B with lamivudine followed by adefovir dipivoxil for those in whom lamivudine-resistance developed reflected current practice. However, the experts noted that there was a subgroup of people with highly replicative disease in whom resistance could develop rapidly; in these people, a strategy of using adefovir dipivoxil in combination with lamivudine might be appropriate\n【56】 - In principle, the use of combination therapies should minimise the risk of developing resistant variants, although long-term follow-up data from studies are lacking. The clinical experts stressed the need for further research on the long-term effectiveness of combination regimens in preventing resistance\n【57】 # Cost effectiveness\n【58】 - The Committee considered evidence from four economic models: one by the Assessment Group, one by each of the two manufacturers involved, and one published analysis by Kanwal and colleagues (which was published after the Assessment Report's deadline for inclusion). The models have similar structures and parameters, and their results are in broad agreement\n【59】 ## Assessment Group model\n【60】 - The Assessment Group model presents analyses for people with HBeAg-positive disease and HBeAg-negative disease separately, and also as a single group, with proportions of people with HBeAg-positive disease and HBeAg-negative disease determined from the parameters of the model\n【61】 - Results are presented for peginterferon alfa-2a (48 weeks' treatment) compared with interferon alfa-2a (24 weeks for HBeAg-positive disease or 48 weeks for HBeAg-negative disease), and for adefovir dipivoxil compared with lamivudine. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for these two comparisons in HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative groups combined were £6100 and £16,500 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) respectively. However, this analysis assumes that, if the first therapy does not produce a sustained response, people receive no further treatment other than best supportive care, whereas in practice people may go on to receive treatment with an alternative agent. The Assessment Group therefore produced an analysis that considered more clinically relevant scenarios in which people could receive a sequence of drug treatments as necessary\n【62】 - It is assumed that all patients are first given a course of treatment with either interferon alfa-2a (for 24 or 48 weeks, depending on HBeAg status) or peginterferon alfa-2a for 48 weeks. If HBeAg or HBsAg seroconversion occurs on one of the interferons, the patients are assumed to take no further antiviral medication; if not, they proceed to one of the following sequences of treatment, which form the basis of the comparison:\n【63】 - best supportive care, that is, no further antiviral medication\n【64】 - lamivudine, then best supportive care on seroconversion or development of resistance\n【65】 - adefovir dipivoxil, then best supportive care on seroconversion or development of resistance\n【66】 - lamivudine, then adefovir dipivoxil on development of resistance, then best supportive care on seroconversion or development of resistance\n【67】 - The Assessment Group analysis also reports ICERs for the use of lamivudine then best supportive care without first using an interferon, and of adefovir dipivoxil then best supportive care without first using an interferon. It did not report on sequences of both lamivudine and adefovir dipivoxil that were not preceded by an interferon. However, because of the underlying assumptions used in the model, these ICERs can be inferred from the equivalent comparisons for sequences including peginterferon alfa-2a or interferon alfa-2a\n【68】 - Comparing these sets of sequences generated a large number of ICER estimates. However, some of the strategies can be excluded from consideration using the notion of dominance or extended dominance. This means that when strategies A, B and C (in order of increasing cost) are compared, if the ICER for B compared with A is higher than that for C compared with A, and if the benefits of B are less than those of C, then B is excluded\n【69】 - For HBeAg-positive disease, the treatment sequences that are not excluded by extended dominance are as follows:\n【70】 - lamivudine then best supportive care (estimated ICER £3500 per QALY compared with best supportive care)\n【71】 - interferon alfa-2a then lamivudine then adefovir dipivoxil then best supportive care (estimated ICER £9900 per QALY compared with lamivudine then best supportive care)\n【72】 - peginterferon alfa-2a then lamivudine then adefovir dipivoxil then best supportive care (estimated ICER £18,800 per QALY compared with interferon alfa-2a then lamivudine then adefovir dipivoxil then best supportive care)\n【73】 - peginterferon alfa-2a then adefovir dipivoxil then lamivudine then best supportive care (estimated ICER £57,000 per QALY compared with peginterferon alfa-2a then lamivudine then adefovir dipivoxil then best supportive care). Note that this treatment sequence did not appear in the Assessment Report, but was prepared by the Assessment Group for the Appraisal Committee before its first meeting\n【74】 - For HBeAg-negative disease, the treatment sequences that are not excluded by extended dominance are as follows:\n【75】 - peginterferon alfa-2a then best supportive care (estimated ICER £3000 per QALY compared with best supportive care)\n【76】 - peginterferon alfa-2a then lamivudine then best supportive care (estimated ICER £4900 per QALY compared with peginterferon alfa-2a then best supportive care)\n【77】 - peginterferon alfa-2a then lamivudine then adefovir dipivoxil then best supportive care (estimated ICER £18,000 per QALY compared with peginterferon alfa-2a then lamivudine then best supportive care)\n【78】 ## Manufacturer's model (Roche)\n【79】 - The model submitted by Roche reports a number of estimated cost effectiveness results, all involving either interferon alfa-2a or peginterferon alfa-2a, for HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative disease separately. Nothing is said about later choices for people for whom the interferon has not been clinically effective. The estimated ICERs for people with HBeAg-positive disease are as follows:\n【80】 - peginterferon alfa-2a for 24 weeks compared with interferon alfa-2a for 24 weeks (ICER £2700 per QALY)\n【81】 - peginterferon alfa-2a for 48 weeks compared with interferon alfa-2a for 24 weeks (ICER £13,900 per QALY)\n【82】 - peginterferon alfa-2a for 48 weeks compared with lamivudine for 48 weeks (ICER £5300 per QALY)\n【83】 - peginterferon alfa-2a for 48 weeks compared with lamivudine for 208 weeks (ICER £5900 per QALY)\n【84】 - peginterferon alfa-2a for 48 weeks compared with adefovir dipivoxil for 48 weeks (ICER £1400 per QALY)\n【85】 - peginterferon alfa-2a for 48 weeks compared with adefovir dipivoxil for 208 weeks (dominant, that is, greater benefit at lower cost than adefovir dipivoxil)\n【86】 - peginterferon alfa-2a for 48 weeks compared with no treatment (ICER £2800 per QALY)\n【87】 - The ICERs for people with HBeAg-negative disease are as follows:\n【88】 - peginterferon alfa-2a for 48 weeks compared with lamivudine for 48 weeks (ICER £3200 per QALY)\n【89】 - peginterferon alfa-2a for 48 weeks compared with lamivudine for 208 weeks (ICER £1900 per QALY)\n【90】 - peginterferon alfa-2a for 48 weeks compared with no treatment (ICER £1500 per QALY)\n【91】 ## Manufacturer's model (Gilead)\n【92】 - The model submitted by Gilead presents estimated cost-effectiveness ratios for a number of single treatments and treatment sequences. However, the cost effectiveness of adefovir dipivoxil compared with best supportive care is not reported. The interferons are not considered as treatment options, and the analyses are for a combined population of people with HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative disease. The estimated ICERs are as follows:\n【93】 - lamivudine then adefovir dipivoxil (when lamivudine resistance emerges) compared with best supportive care – ICER £6700 per QALY\n【94】 - lamivudine then adefovir dipivoxil (when lamivudine resistance emerges) compared with lamivudine then best supportive care (when lamivudine resistance emerges) – ICER £9200 per QALY\n【95】 - adefovir dipivoxil then lamivudine (when adefovir dipivoxil resistance emerges) compared with best supportive care – ICER £8200 per QALY\n【96】 - adefovir dipivoxil then lamivudine (when adefovir dipivoxil resistance emerges) compared with lamivudine then best supportive care (when lamivudine resistance emerges) – ICER £11,400 per QALY\n【97】 - adefovir dipivoxil then lamivudine (when adefovir dipivoxil resistance emerges) compared with lamivudine then adefovir dipivoxil (when lamivudine resistance emerges) – ICER £29,400 per QALY\n【98】 ## Published model\n【99】 - The published model (Kanwal and colleagues) evaluated a 'do nothing' strategy (equivalent to best supportive care), interferon alfa, lamivudine, adefovir dipivoxil, and lamivudine then adefovir dipivoxil. For HBeAg-positive disease, the estimated ICERs for the non-dominated strategies are as follows:\n【100】 - interferon alfa compared with best supportive care – ICER $2300 (£1300 at an exchange rate of $1.75 per £1) per QALY\n【101】 - lamivudine then adefovir dipivoxil, compared with interferon alfa – ICER $16,600 (£9500) per QALY\n【102】 - adefovir dipivoxil, compared with lamivudine then adefovir dipivoxil – ICER $91,000 (£52,000) per QALY\n【103】 - In the analysis for HBeAg-negative disease, lamivudine then adefovir dipivoxil (as salvage therapy after resistance to lamivudine develops) is both cheaper and more effective than all other treatment options\n【104】 ## Overall results of the models\n【105】 - The models show that interferon alfa or peginterferon alfa-2a therapies followed by lamivudine then adefovir dipivoxil, where necessary, appear to be cost effective relative to alternative strategies. In most of the analyses, strategies in which adefovir dipivoxil is used before lamivudine, or without lamivudine, in the sequence are dominated by the alternative strategies. The exceptions are Gilead's estimated ICER of £29,400 per QALY for adefovir dipivoxil then lamivudine, compared with lamivudine then adefovir dipivoxil, and the Assessment Group's estimated ICER of £57,000 per QALY (for HBeAg-positive patients) for peginterferon alfa-2a then adefovir dipivoxil then lamivudine, compared with peginterferon alfa-2a then lamivudine then adefovir dipivoxil\n【106】 # Consideration of the evidence\n【107】 - The Committee reviewed the data available on the clinical and cost effectiveness of adefovir dipivoxil and peginterferon alfa-2a for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B, having considered evidence on the nature of the condition and the value placed on the benefits of adefovir dipivoxil and peginterferon alfa-2a by people with chronic hepatitis B, those who represent them, and clinical experts. It was also mindful of the need to take account of the effective use of NHS resources\n【108】 - The Committee considered that peginterferon alfa-2a was clinically and cost effective compared with interferon alfa therapy for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B on the basis of the cost effectiveness modelling. However, given that the difference in the rates of HBeAg seroconversion and ALT normalisation (HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B) compared with standard interferon alfa-2a were not statistically significant, the Committee was not persuaded that the potential advantages of peginterferon alfa-2a over standard interferon had been conclusively proven. The Committee concluded, therefore, that peginterferon alfa-2ashould be considered as an alternative to interferon alfa for the management of chronic hepatitis B during the initial phase of treatment\n【109】 - The experts stated that the effects of initial treatment with peginterferon alfa-2a in achieving a good response were different for HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative disease. The Committee was persuaded, however, that the response to peginterferon alfa-2a as measured by HBeAg seroconversion (in the case of HBeAg-positive disease) or an adequate reduction in viral load (in the case of HBeAg-negative disease) was clinically important in both cases. Thus the Committee concluded, on this basis, that peginterferon alfa-2a should be recommended as an option in first-line therapy for both HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B\n【110】 - The Committee next considered the use of the oral antiviral agents (specifically adefovir dipivoxil) for the long-term treatment of both HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B. The Committee considered the cost-effectiveness analysis presented by the assessment team on the use of adefovir dipivoxil compared with lamivudine in the long-term treatment of chronic hepatitis B. In addition the Committee discussed the cost-effectiveness analysis of the various treatment sequences that could be used over the entire disease process. It was apparent that adefovir dipivoxil was cost effective when compared directly with lamivudine for long-term therapy, if it was assumed that a switch could not be made to the alternative treatment if resistance developed. However, when considering the use of adefovir dipivoxil in the various treatment sequences, the Committee heard that the most cost-effective option was for it to be used following the emergence of viral resistance to lamivudine\n【111】 - The Committee heard the concerns of the clinical experts about the potential impact of the development of resistant viral mutations on future treatment options, based on the current experience of lamivudine use. The experts also stated that adefovir dipivoxil was less likely than lamivudine to result in viral resistance over the short term. They also expressed the view that viral resistance may be encouraged by the use of single agents and discussed with the Committee the possibility of recommending combination therapies for long-term treatment\n【112】 - The Committee was persuaded that it was likely that drug-resistance might be attenuated by using antiviral drugs in combination. The Committee felt unable to recommend routine use of combination therapies in the absence of trial evidence on the effect of combination therapy on drug resistance and its cost effectiveness. However, the Committee considered that it was not appropriate under these circumstances to recommend the use of adefovir dipivoxil only after resistance had already developed to another antiviral agent. It was persuaded by the expert testimony that it was possible to identify groups of people for whom lamivudine resistance is more likely to occur rapidly (for example, those with highly replicative disease), and those for whom development of lamivudine resistance is likely to have an adverse outcome (for example, those in whom a flare up of the infection may precipitate decompensated liver disease). Consequently it was sympathetic to the experts' view that it was appropriate to use adefovir dipivoxil for patients in whom the development of lamivudine-resistance would be considered particularly hazardous. The Committee was also sympathetic to the experts' view that under these circumstances the use of adefovir dipivoxil alone or in combination with lamivudine might be appropriate\n【113】 - The Committee concluded that it was appropriate to recommend adefovir dipivoxil as an option for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B for patients in whom prolonged oral antiviral treatment is required. It was also persuaded that this should be only after the use of an interferon as initial treatment unless this was contraindicated. The Committee was mindful that in the Assessment Group's economic model, the sequence of therapy with adefovir dipivoxil before lamivudine was not cost effective compared with the alternative of lamivudine followed by adefovir dipivoxil. The Committee was, however, persuaded that the decision to use adefovir dipivoxil (alone or in combination with lamivudine) would need to be made on a case-by-case basis. This should take into account various factors including HBeAg status, stage of disease process (for example the presence of compensated or decompensated cirrhosis) and the presence of, or likelihood of the emergence of, virus resistance\n【114】 - The Committee accepted consultee advice that drug treatment should be initiated only by a healthcare professional with expertise in the management of viral hepatitis, but that the task of continuing and monitoring therapy could be undertaken by general practitioners under shared-care arrangements.# Recommendations for further research\n【115】 - There is considerable concern about viral resistance in the long-term treatment of chronic hepatitis B. Further research is needed on the role of combination therapy with antiviral drugs in reducing the development of resistance to treatment. There is at least one ongoing study comparing lamivudine alone with lamivudine in combination with adefovir dipivoxil in treatment-naive people with chronic hepatitis B.# Implications for the NHS\n【116】 - Since the final appraisal determination was issued, NICE has carried out more detailed costing analysis to support implementation of the guidance.

These effects are usually transient and rarely require discontinuation of therapy. Diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and constipation have been reported. Both anorexia with some weight loss and increased appetite with weight gain have also been reported. The administration of delayed-release divalproex sodium may result in reduction of gastrointestinal side effects in some patients\n【47】 - CNS Effects: Sedative effects have occurred in patients receiving valproate alone but occur most often in patients receiving combination therapy.

In the Moderna vaccine trial, axillary swelling or tenderness in the vaccination arm was reported in approximately 12% of participants following dose 1 and 16% of participants following dose 2 of the vaccine 1 . For the Pfizer-BionNTech vaccine, lymphadenopathy was reported as an unsolicited adverse event in 64 participants in the vaccine group compared to the 6 in the placebo group 2 . The rates of lymphadenopathy reported in the trials were based on physical examination; rates incidentally detected in general medical imaging will likely be higher. Due to the mass COVID-19 vaccination underway in Ontario, lymphadenopathy is expected to be increasingly detected by radiologists when interpreting images related to the neck, shoulder and chest, as well as in breast imaging.

Facilities are advised to collect information on all recent vaccination for their patients\n【3】 - Where possible and when it does not unduly delay care, schedule imaging appointments that cover the axilla, neck, shoulder and chest before patients receive the COVID-19 vaccine, or 6 weeks after vaccination (either after the first or second vaccine dose) to allow for reactive lymphadenopathy to resolve\n【4】 - This scheduling guidance should be incorporated based on the facility's available resources to reschedule appointments and use imaging resources appropriately; where rescheduling is not feasible, ensure that vaccination information is collected\n【5】 - Patients that report vaccination history less than 6 weeks at the time of their appointment may be advised of the possibility of lymphadenopathy but do not need to be rescheduled. Where possible, provide participants the choice to rebook if they prefer\n【6】 # Provide patients with information regarding vaccine-related lymphadenopathy\n【7】 - The following information can be provided to vaccinated patients to help reduce anxiety:\n【8】 - If you recently got the COVID-19 or other vaccine, you may have swelling in the lymph nodes on the side you got the injection (around or in your armpit or neck). This swelling is your body's normal reaction to the vaccine and is a sign that your body is making antibodies in response to the vaccine\n【9】 - If lymph node swelling is seen on your imaging test, the radiologist may ask you to come back for additional imaging to check that the swelling has gone away\n【10】 - If you notice swelling in your lymph nodes after vaccination, and it lasts for more than 6 weeks after your vaccination, you should let your family doctor or nurse practitioner know\n【11】 # Management of vaccine-related lymphadenopathy in medical imaging\n【12】 - Vaccines are known to cause lymphadenopathy. This is a reaction to the vaccine and related to antibody production. If lymphadenopathy is detected within 4 weeks of vaccination and is ipsilateral to the vaccination site, management should be based on available clinical history as in  - This finding could be considered benign\n【13】 - Radiologists should recommend that the primary care provider follow up with the patient to ensure that no lymph nodes are palpable 6 weeks after most recent vaccination\n【14】 # Nonpalpable\n【15】 - Clinical and/or vaccination history insufficient, or participant is at risk from other etiology (e.g., high risk lung screening patients, cancer surveillance imaging patients)\n【16】 - Patient should be recalled for further assessment\n【17】 - Following appropriate diagnostic assessment:\n【18】 - Patient may undergo short interval follow up, a minimum of 6 weeks after their last imaging test\n【19】 - Consider timing of second vaccine dose with respect to follow up imaging when appropriate\n【20】 - Follow up imaging using ultrasound is recommended\n【21】 - Unresolved lymphadenopathy should undergo further assessment\n【22】 - Palpable E.g., referral from primary care provider Note: Primary care providers have been asked to monitor their patients with suspected vaccine-related adenopathy clinically for 6 weeks from the date of vaccination. If adenopathy persists after 6 weeks, in-person physical examination and imaging is advised\n【23】 - Diagnostic assessment with ultrasound and mammography (where relevant) is recommended\n【24】 - Patient may undergo short interval follow up, a minimum of 6 weeks after their last imaging test.

Lipases thus comprise a subclass of the esterases\n【3】 - Lipases are ubiquitous throughout living organisms, and genes encoding lipases are even present in certain viruses\n【4】 # Function\n【5】 - Most lipases act at a specific position on the glycerol backbone of a lipid substrate (A1, A2 or A3)\n【6】 - In the example of human pancreatic lipase (HPL), which is the main enzyme responsible for breaking down fats in the human digestive system, a lipase acts to convert triglyceride substrates found in oils from food to monoglycerides and free fatty acids\n【7】 - Myriad other lipase activities exist in nature, especially when the phospholipases and sphingomyelinases are considered\n【8】 # Structure\n【9】 - While a diverse array of genetically distinct lipase enzymes are found in nature, and represent several types of protein folds and catalytic mechanisms, most are built on an alpha/beta hydrolase fold   and employ a chymotrypsin-like hydrolysis mechanism involving a serine nucleophile, an acid residue (usually aspartic acid), and a histidine\n【10】 # Location of action\n【11】 - Some lipases work within the interior spaces of living cells to degrade lipids\n【12】 - In the example of lysosomal lipase, the enzyme is confined within an organelle called the lysosome\n【13】 - Other lipase enzymes, such as pancreatic lipases, are found in the spaces outside of cells and have roles in the metabolism, absorption and transport of lipids throughout the body\n【14】 - As biological membranes are integral to living cells and are largely composed of phospholipids, lipases play important roles in cell biology\n【15】 - Furthermore, lipases are involved in diverse biological processes ranging from routine metabolism of dietary triglycerides to cell signaling and inflammation\n【16】 # Lipases of Humans\n【17】 - The main lipases in the human digestive system are human pancreatic lipase (HPL) and pancreatic lipase related protein 2 (PLRP2), which are secreted by the pancreas. Humans also have several other related enzymes, including hepatic lipase (HL), endothelial lipase, and lipoprotein lipase. Not all of these lipases function in the gut\n【18】 - Other lipases include LIPH, LIPI, LIPJ, LIPK, LIPM, and LIPN\n【19】 - There also are a diverse array of phospholipases, but these are not always classified with the other lipases\n【20】 # Industrial Uses\n【21】 - Lipases from fungi and bacteria serve important roles in human practices as ancient as yogurt and cheese fermentation. However, lipases are also being exploited as cheap and versatile catalysts to degrade lipids in more modern applications. For instance, a biotechnology company has brought recombinant lipase enzymes to market for use in applications such as baking, laundry detergents and even as biocatalysts  in alternative energy strategies to convert vegeoil into fuel\n【22】 # Differential Diagnosisof Abnormalitiesin Lipase\n【23】 ## Increased Lipase\n【24】 - Zinc acetate\n【25】 - Pancreatitis\n【26】 # Additional images\n【27】 - General formula of a carboxylate ester\n【28】 - Glycerol\n【29】 - General structure of a triglyceride", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": "无关文本#26#29#内容与正文无关", "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-15 17:51:29", "update_time": "2024-04-15 19:27:08"}

It is recommended only if the conditions in the managed access agreement for niraparib are followed\n【4】 - This recommendation is not intended to affect treatment with niraparib that was started in the NHS before this guidance was published. People having treatment outside this recommendation may continue without change to the funding arrangements in place for them before this guidance was published, until they and their NHS clinician consider it appropriate to stop\n【5】 - Why the committee made these recommendations\n【6】 - There are no maintenance treatments routinely available for advanced ovarian, fallopian tube or peritoneal cancer that has responded to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. For some people, maintenance treatment is available through the Cancer Drugs Fund\n【7】 - Clinical evidence comes from PRIMA, an ongoing clinical trial, which shows that niraparib delays disease progression. But it has not shown whether people having niraparib live longer, because they have not been followed up for long enough\n【8】 - Because of the clinical uncertainty, the cost-effectiveness estimates are very uncertain. They may be higher than what NICE normally considers an accepuse of NHS resources. So, niraparib cannot be recommended for routine use in the NHS\n【9】 - Longer follow-up data from PRIMA could help address the uncertainty about the clinical effectiveness of niraparib in this population. Niraparib has the potential to be a cost-effective use of NHS resources. So, it is recommended for use in the Cancer Drugs Fund while more data from the trial are collected.# Information about niraparib\n【10】 # Marketing authorisation indication\n【11】 - Niraparib (Zejula, GlaxoSmithKline) has a marketing authorisation in the UK 'as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with advanced epithelial (FIGO Stages 3 and 4) high-grade ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who are in response (complete or partial) following completion of first-line platinum-based chemotherapy'\n【12】 # Dosage in the marketing authorisation\n【13】 - The dosage schedule is available in the summary of product characteristics\n【14】 - The list price is £4,500 for 56 100‑mg ts (excluding VAT; BNF online accessed November 2020). The company has a commercial arrangement. This makes niraparib available to the NHS with a discount. The size of the discount is commercial in confidence. It is the company's responsibility to let relevant NHS organisations know details of the discount.# Committee discussion\n【15】 - The appraisal committee was aware that several issues were resolved during the technical engagement stage, and agreed that:\n【16】 - the first-line treatment response rates from the PRIMA trial were generalisable to rates seen in UK practice (issue 1, see technical report page 2)\n【17】 - the dose of niraparib included in the model for continued treatment after 3 years is appropriate (issue 1, see technical report page 2)\n【18】 - not including the long-term remission assumption in the model is appropriate (issue 7, see technical report page 11)\n【19】 - At technical engagement, the company accepted the ERG's revised costs for heart rate and blood pressure monitoring and the alternative resource-use estimates for progression-free survival in the routine surveillance arm\n【20】 - The committee recognised that there were remaining areas of uncertainty associated with the analyses presented and took these into account in its decision making. It discussed the following issues (issues 1 to 6 and 8 to 12), which were outstanding after the technical engagement stage\n【21】 # The condition\n【22】 ## People with ovarian cancer would welcome a new effective maintenance therapy\n【23】 - The patient expert explained that advanced platinum-sensitive ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer is a devastating condition. Knowing that the disease can relapse is a major psychological burden for people with the disease and their families. For most people without a BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation there are no first-line maintenance treatments available for disease that has responded to platinum-based chemotherapy, although bevacizumab is available for some people through the Cancer Drugs Fund. People who are not eligible for first-line maintenance treatment have routine surveillance until the disease relapses. The patient expert explained that taking a maintenance treatment has a psychological benefit and improves quality of life compared with being on routine surveillance, which can feel like waiting for the cancer to come back. The clinical experts agreed with the patient expert. The committee recognised the need for effective maintenance treatment options after first-line treatment for advanced disease. It concluded that people would welcome new maintenance treatment options\n【24】 # Treatment pathway\n【25】 ## There is an unmet need for maintenance treatments after first-line platinum-based chemotherapy\n【26】 - First-line treatment for advanced ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer is surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy. Options for surgery are primary debulking surgery before first-line chemotherapy treatment, or interval debulking surgery between cycles of first-line chemotherapy. First-line maintenance treatment with a poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor is available through the Cancer Drugs Fund for people with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation. For people without a BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation, there are no first-line PARP inhibitor maintenance treatments. Routine surveillance is the only option for people who are not eligible for maintenance treatment. The clinical experts explained that there is a high unmet need for more maintenance treatment options after first-line treatment for advanced disease. They noted that there is a clear population that would benefit from niraparib maintenance therapy at this point in the treatment pathway. The committee concluded that there is an unmet need for new effective maintenance treatment options after first-line platinum-based chemotherapy\n【27】 # Clinical evidence\n【28】 # Thepopulationcoveredbyniraparib'smarketingauthorisationindicationisbroaderthanthepopulationincludedin PRIMA\n【29】 - PRIMA is a double-blind, randomised controlled trial comparing niraparib with placebo as maintenance treatment of advanced ovarian cancer. It included people with or without a BRCA gene mutation, who had advanced (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics  stages 3 and 4) high-grade ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer that was in response (complete or partial) to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. The primary end point was progression-free survival based on blinded independent central review. PRIMA excluded people with stage 3 cancer who had no visible residual disease after primary debulking surgery. The rationale for excluding this group was that their prognosis was considered to be better than other groups with advanced ovarian cancer. However, niraparib's marketing authorisation includes all people with stage 3 or 4 high-grade ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who are in response to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. The committee concluded that the population covered by the marketing authorisation indication is broader than the population included in PRIMA\n【30】 ## Prognosis of stage 3 cancer is likely to be better when there is no visible residual disease after primary debulking surgery, compared with after interval debulking surgery\n【31】 - The ERG commented on the prognosis of stage 3 cancer after surgery. It suggested that the prognosis for no visible residual disease might be similar when achieved by primary debulking surgery and interval debulking surgery. But the clinical experts explained that the prognosis for no visible residual disease after primary debulking surgery might be better than after interval debulking surgery. This is based on evidence from the EORTC-NCIC trial, which compared the outcomes of people with ovarian cancer with no visible residual disease after either type of surgery. The group with the best prognosis in the EORTC-NCIC trial was people with no visible residual disease after primary debulking surgery. However, the clinical experts explained that there is still uncertainty around which type of surgery leads to the best outcomes, and that the biggest prognostic factor is having no visible residual disease. The committee concluded it is likely that the prognosis of stage 3 cancer is better when there is no visible residual disease after primary debulking surgery, compared with after interval debulking surgery\n【32】 ## The treatment effect of niraparib is likely to be similar irrespective of surgery type\n【33】 - The clinical experts explained that although prognosis is likely to be different after primary debulking surgery compared with interval debulking surgery, they would not expect there to be a difference in the treatment effect of niraparib after either type of surgery. They highlighted that niraparib has been shown to be effective as a first-line maintenance treatment  and for maintenance treatment for relapsed disease. There is no reason to expect that the outcomes after niraparib treatment would differ because of the type of surgery that had been done, if there is no visible residual disease. The committee concluded that the treatment effect of niraparib is likely to be similar for stage 3 cancer that has no visible residual disease after either primary debulking surgery or interval debulking surgery\n【34】 ## The proportion of people with stage 3 cancer and no visible residual disease after surgery is highly uncertain\n【35】 - The clinical experts explained that there is variation in the rate of achieving no visible residual disease after surgery in clinical practice in England. They also explained that the rates of primary debulking surgery and interval debulking surgery vary, because neither is widely accepted as the standard of care. They estimated that about 25% to 50% of people with advanced ovarian cancer may have stage 3 cancer and no visible residual disease after primary debulking surgery. However, this estimate is not reliable because there is no evidence available to support it. The committee concluded that the proportion of people with stage 3 cancer and no visible residual disease after surgery is highly uncertain, and there is no robust estimate of the size of this population in clinical practice\n【36】 # The PRIMAintention-to-treatanalysisisappropriatefordecision-making\n【37】 - PRIMA did not include people with stage 3 cancer and no visible residual disease after primary debulking surgery. However, this population is included within the marketing authorisation indication . Although the prognosis is likely to be different for no visible residual disease after primary debulking surgery compared with interval debulking surgery , niraparib's treatment effect is unlikely to be different . The company presented an analysis to adjust for the difference in prognosis between these groups. This used data from a clinical trial (PAOLA‑1) of olaparib (a different PARP inhibitor) to show the treatment effect for a simulated 'PRIMA intention-to-treat population', which excluded people with stage 3 cancer and no visible residual disease after primary debulking surgery, compared with a population that included only these people. The ERG explained that although there is a difference in prognosis between these groups, the effect of this cannot be reliably estimated. And the PAOLA-1 data are not generalisable to PRIMA because of differences in the treatments taken. It explained that even if the treatment effect could be reliably estimated, the proportion of people with stage 3 cancer and no visible residual disease after primary debulking surgery could not be reliably estimated . The clinical experts agreed that there are no robust estimates of the proportion of people with stage 3 cancer and no visible residual disease irrespective of the type of surgery they had, so it is not possible to reliably adjust the PRIMA intention-to-treat data. The ERG explained that adjusting the PRIMA intention-to-treat data by reweighting the population with stage 3 cancer and no visible residual disease after interval debulking surgery would rely on having an estimate of the proportion of people with stage 3 cancer and no visible residual disease after primary debulking surgery. The committee acknowledged that PRIMA did not include people with stage 3 cancer and no visible residual disease after primary debulking surgery, and there was no reliable method to adjust the PRIMA data to account for this. It concluded that the population in PRIMA does not fully reflect the population who would likely be offered niraparib in clinical practice, but the PRIMA intention-to-treat analysis is appropriate for decision making\n【38】 # PRIMAisgeneralisabletothedosageusedinclinicalpractice\n【39】 - Because of a protocol change during the study, about two-thirds of people in PRIMA took a fixed dose of 300 mg of niraparib and around one-third took an individualised dose of niraparib based on weight and platelet count. The clinical experts explained that individualised dosing would be used in practice because of toxicity concerns, which is reflected in the summary of product characteristics. The company did subgroup analyses of fixed and individualised dosing in PRIMA. These suggested that niraparib increased progression-free survival compared with placebo, irrespective of the type of dosing. The ERG suggested that these analyses should be considered exploratory because they were done post hoc and were non-stratified. The committee agreed that the analyses were uncertain because the individualised dosing group had fewer participants and shorter follow up than the fixed-dose group. Also, PRIMA was not powered to show a difference between the dosing groups. The committee acknowledged that the progression-free survival benefit is more uncertain for the individualised dosing group, as shown by wider confidence intervals. It noted that the summary of product characteristics states that exploratory subgroup analyses of fixed and individualised dosing show comparable efficacy for them both. The clinical experts explained that based on the dose taken by participants in PRIMA, it was likely to be generalisable to clinical practice. They also noted that niraparib's efficacy using individualised dosing is supported by evidence from NOVA (a study of niraparib in relapsed disease). This suggested that a dose of less than 300 mg does not reduce efficacy. The committee concluded that the evidence in PRIMA is generalisable to the dose which will be used in clinical practice\n【40】 ## Subsequent treatments used in PRIMA are not fully representative of clinical practice, but data are generalisable to clinical practice\n【41】 - Of the participants who had progressed disease in PRIMA, 85% of people on niraparib and 81% on routine surveillance had chemotherapy after progression. The clinical experts explained that this reflects clinical practice, because PRIMA excluded people with stage 3 cancer and no visible residual disease after primary debulking surgery. So, people in PRIMA had a poorer prognosis than the population who would be eligible for niraparib in the NHS. A small percentage of participants in PRIMA had a PARP inhibitor or immunotherapy after first-line niraparib maintenance treatment. The clinical experts explained that this is not representative of clinical practice in England. The committee acknowledged that PRIMA included a small proportion of people having subsequent treatments that are not available in the NHS but concluded that the PRIMA data are generalisable to clinical practice\n【42】 # Clinical effectiveness\n【43】 ## Niraparib improves progression-free survival compared with placebo\n【44】 - Median progression-free survival in PRIMA was 13.8 months with niraparib and 8.2 months with placebo. The difference in median progression-free survival was 5.6 months (hazard ratio 0.62, 95% confidence interval 0.50 to 0.76; p<0.001). Subgroup analyses indicated that niraparib increases median progression-free survival compared with placebo for people with or without a BRCA gene mutation. The committee concluded that niraparib improves progression-free survival for people with ovarian cancer that has completely or partially responded to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy\n【45】 # PRIMAdataonoverallsurvivalandtimetosecondprogressionareimmature\n【46】 - Overall survival was a secondary end point in PRIMA. Less than 11% of participants in PRIMA had died at the latest analysis (9.9% in the niraparib arm and 12.6% in the placebo arm). The difference in overall survival was not statistically significant (hazard ratio for death 0.70, 95% confidence interval 0.44 to 1.11) and it is not yet clear whether niraparib will improve overall survival. The clinical experts acknowledged the uncertainty in the results but suggested that niraparib might improve overall survival and may lead to cure in some people. Time from randomisation to disease progression on the next anti-cancer therapy (PFS2) was also a secondary end point in PRIMA. The PFS2 event rate (20%) was low and there was no statistically significant difference between niraparib and placebo (hazard ratio 0.81, 95% confidence interval 0.58 to 1.14). The committee concluded that the data for overall survival and PFS2 for niraparib after first-line treatment are immature and the survival benefit is uncertain\n【47】 # The company's economic model\n【48】 ## The company's model structure is appropriate for decision making\n【49】 - The company presented a 3‑state partitioned survival model to estimate the cost effectiveness of niraparib compared with routine surveillance. The 3 health states were progression-free, progressed disease and death. The committee noted that PFS2 data are available in PRIMA. These could have been used to inform a 4‑state model to capture the effect of second progression on quality of life and related costs. The company suggested that using a 4‑state model would add additional uncertainty because the PFS2 data are immature . The committee concluded that although there are uncertainties with the company's 3‑state model, it is robust enough for decision making\n【50】 ## The overall-survival estimates in the company's model are highly uncertain\n【51】 - A key driver of the results in the model is the way in which overall-survival estimates for niraparib are derived. The company estimated overall survival for the routine surveillance arm by fitting a log-logistic accelerated failure time model to the observed overall-survival data from PRIMA. The estimates were validated against overall-survival data for people on routine surveillance over 15 years from the University of Edinburgh Ovarian Cancer Database. The company estimated overall survival in the niraparib arm using a hazard ratio derived from assuming a 1:2 ratio for progression-free survival gain to overall-survival gain, and applied this to the log-logistic routine surveillance overall-survival curve. This ratio is based on an assumption that a 1‑month gain in progression-free survival leads to a 2‑month gain in overall survival. The ratio was chosen based on the relationship between progression-free survival and overall survival in a study of olaparib compared with routine surveillance as second-line maintenance treatment (Study 19), which has long-term follow-up data. The ERG considered that there was not sufficient evidence to support the use of a progression-free survival to overall-survival ratio or to determine what ratio would be most appropriate. It explained that the hazard ratio derived from the 1:2 ratio used in the company's model did not reflect the hazard ratio observed for overall survival in PRIMA . The ERG also explained that it is methodologically inappropriate to apply a hazard ratio to a log-logistic accelerated failure time model, which does not assume proportional hazards. Also, using a hazard ratio assumes a constant treatment effect over time and there is no evidence to support this assumption. The company highlighted that in other studies of olaparib maintenance such as Study 19, overall survival improved for olaparib compared with routine surveillance as more data accumulated during follow up. The committee acknowledged that the PRIMA overall-survival data are very immature. So, it is not known if the long-term results will show improvement in overall survival of a similar magnitude for niraparib as that seen with olaparib in Study 19. The clinical experts considered that the company's assumption that overall-survival benefit is twice the progression-free survival benefit is plausible. But they stated that the overall-survival data from PRIMA are too immature to reliably quantify the overall-survival benefit. Overall-survival data for niraparib are available in PRIMA. The company could have extrapolated long-term overall survival for niraparib, as it did for the routine surveillance arm. The committee was disappointed that these data had not been included in the company's model. The company did not consider it appropriate to extrapolate the overall-survival data from PRIMA, because there were no real-world data that could be used to validate the curve for the treatment arm. The ERG highlighted that any estimation of overall survival should be validated, as should the use of a ratio for progression-free survival gain to overall-survival gain. The committee acknowledged that extrapolated overall-survival from PRIMA data would be uncertain, but the ratio of progression-free survival to overall-survival is also uncertain. It concluded that overall-survival gain may be at least equivalent to progression-free survival gain. But it is highly uncertain whether the overall-survival gain will exceed the progression-free survival gain, or by how much. It concluded that further overall-survival data will reduce the uncertainty\n【52】 # Assumptions in the economic model\n【53】 ## Time to treatment discontinuation is modelled appropriately by the company\n【54】 - The summary of product characteristics for niraparib recommends that treatment should be continued until disease progression or toxicity. It does not include a time-limited stopping rule. The company included a stopping rule in its model, which assumed that 15% of people who had not stopped treatment at 3 years would continue to have niraparib. A 3‑year stopping rule was included in PRIMA, but some people took niraparib for longer than 3 years. The ERG noted that the proportion of people who continued taking niraparib after 3 years is unknown, so the ERG's base case did not include treatment discontinuation at 3 years. The clinical experts explained that most people would stop treatment with niraparib at 3 years unless there was evidence of s, persistent disease. They considered that the proportion of people assumed to stop niraparib at 3 years in the company's model is appropriate. The committee concluded that the company's approach, which assumed a proportion of people stopping treatment at 3 years, is appropriate\n【55】 ## Age-related utility decrements should be included in the model\n【56】 - The company did not include age-related utility decrements in its base-case analysis. It suggested that this is appropriate because the quality of life measured in PRIMA was consistent across age groups and did not change considerably over a 56‑week period. The ERG explained that the company's approach overestimates both the utility of people as they age and the cost effectiveness of niraparib. The ERG included age-related utility decrements in its analyses. The committee agreed it is reasonable to assume that people's quality of life decreases as they age, which should be reflected in the model. The committee did not consider the company's justification for not including age-related utility decrements to be valid. It concluded that age-related utility decrements should be included in the model\n【57】 ## Subsequent treatments are modelled appropriately, but data are immature\n【58】 - The ERG noted that the PRIMA data are not mature enough to understand which second-line, third-line and maintenance treatments will be offered to people whose disease relapses. It highlighted the importance of interpreting overall-survival data alongside data on subsequent treatments after disease progression. This may be possible when more mature data becomes available from PRIMA. Because the subsequent treatments in the immature PRIMA data were not wholly representative of the treatment options in clinical practice , the company obtained the costs for subsequent treatments from key opinion leaders and used these in its model. The committee concluded that the data on subsequent treatments in PRIMA are immature, but the company appropriately included subsequent treatments that are reflective of clinical practice in its model\n【59】 # Cost-effectiveness results\n【60】 ## None of the analyses reflect the committee's preferred assumptions\n【61】 - Because of confidential commercial arrangements for subsequent treatments in relapsed disease, none of the cost-effectiveness results are reported here. But none of the company's or ERG's analyses reflected the committee's preferences, which are as follows:\n【62】 - use the PRIMA intention-to-treat population\n【63】 - use a progression-free survival gain to overall-survival gain ratio of 1:1\n【64】 - do not include a long-term remission assumption or costs in the progression-free survival health state after 10 years, which was agreed at technical engagement\n【65】 - include the stopping rule with 15% of people still on niraparib at 3 years continuing treatment\n【66】 - include age-related utility decrements\n【67】 - include the revised costs of monitoring heart rate and blood pressure, which was accepted by the company at technical engagement\n【68】 - include the alternative resource-use estimates for routine surveillance during progression-free survival, which was accepted by the company at technical engagement\n【69】 # Niraparibisnotrecommendedforroutineuseinthe NHS\n【70】 - The committee acknowledged that the company's incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were within the range usually considered a cost-effective use of NHS resources. But the committee's preferred ICER was not within the range usually considered a cost-effective use of NHS resources. It noted that the biggest driver of cost effectiveness was the niraparib overall-survival estimate and that this was highly uncertain. Therefore, the committee concluded that the ICER for niraparib compared with routine surveillance was very uncertain, and that it could not recommend niraparib maintenance treatment for routine NHS use in adults with advanced ovarian, fallopian tube and peritoneal cancer after response to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy\n【71】 # Cancer Drugs Fund\n【72】 # Niraparibmeetsthe Cancer Drugs Fundcriteria\n【73】 - Having concluded that niraparib could not be recommended for routine use, the committee then considered if it could be recommended as maintenance treatment for advanced ovarian cancer after response to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy within the Cancer Drugs Fund. The committee discussed the arrangements for the Cancer Drugs Fund agreed by NICE and NHS England in 2016, noting NICE's Cancer Drugs Fund methods guide (addendum). It noted that:\n【74】 - The company expressed an interest in niraparib being considered for the Cancer Drugs Fund\n【75】 - Data from PRIMA are immature and median overall survival was not reached in the placebo arm\n【76】 - PRIMA is still ongoing and further data could help reduce uncertainties about long-term progression-free survival, overall survival and time to second progression\n【77】 - Overall survival was a key driver of the cost-effectiveness results\n【78】 - The Systemic Anti-Cancer Therapy dataset could provide data on stage 3 cancer with no visible residual disease after primary debulking surgery, the proportion of people having subsequent treatment and the treatments used\n【79】 - The company's price for niraparib, including a commercial arrangement, means that it has plausible potential to be cost effective.The committee concluded that niraparib met the criteria to be considered for inclusion in the Cancer Drugs Fund. It recommended niraparib for use within the Cancer Drugs Fund as an option for people with advanced (FIGO stages 3 and 4) high-grade epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer after response to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy if the conditions in the managed access agreement are followed. When the guidance is next reviewed the company should use the committee's preferred assumptions as set out in section 3.17, unless new evidence indicates otherwise\n【80】 # Innovation\n【81】 ## The model is adequate to capture the benefits of niraparib\n【82】 - The company considered niraparib to be innovative. It explained that there are no PARP inhibitors available as first-line maintenance treatment for people who do not have a BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation. It noted that niraparib will be the first treatment to offer the benefit of maintenance therapy to people with advanced ovarian cancer, irrespective of BRCA mutation status. The clinical experts agreed that niraparib would be a step-change in the first-line treatment of advanced ovarian cancer for people without a BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation. The committee considered that the model included all health-related quality-of-life benefits.

In general, a loading dose of twice the daily dose is recommended on the first day of therapy to result in plasma concentrations close to steady-state by the second day of therapy\n【8】 - The daily dose of DIFLUCAN for the treatment of infections other than vaginal candidiasis should be based on the infecting organism and the patient's response to therapy. Treatment should be continued until clinical parameters or laboratory tests indicate that active fungal infection has subsided. An inadequate period of treatment may lead to recurrence of active infection. Patients with AIDS and cryptococcal meningitis or recurrent oropharyngeal candidiasis usually require maintenance therapy to prevent relapse\n【9】 - Oropharyngeal candidiasis\n【10】 - The recommended dosage of DIFLUCAN for oropharyngeal candidiasis is 200 mg on the first day, followed by 100 mg once daily.

Connect the long needle to the patient by an intravenous catheter that is prefilled with 0.9% sterile sodium chloride and that is used exclusively for the lutetium Lu 177 dotatate infusion into the patient\n【114】 - Use a clamp or pump to regulate the flow of the sodium chloride solution via the short needle into the lutetium Lu 177 dotatate vial at a rate of 50 mL/hour to 100 mL/hour for 5 to 10 minutes and then 200 mL/hour to 300 mL/hour for an additional 25 to 30 minutes (the sodium chloride solution entering the vial through the short needle will carry the lutetium Lu 177 dotatate from the vial to the patient via the catheter connected to the long needle over a total duration of 30 to 40 minutes)\n【115】 - Do not administer lutetium Lu 177 dotatate as an intravenous bolus\n【116】 - During the infusion, ensure that the level of solution in the lutetium Lu 177 dotatate vial remains constant\n【117】 - Disconnect the vial from the long needle line and clamp the saline line once the level of radioactivity is sfor at least five minutes\n【118】 - Follow the infusion with an intravenous flush of 25 mL of 0.9% sterile sodium chloride\n【119】 - Dispose of any unused medicinal product or waste material in accordance with local and federal laws\n【120】 - The mean and standard deviation (SD) of the estimated radiation absorbed doses for adults receiving lutetium Lu 177 dotatate are shown in  The maximum penetration in tissue is 2.2 mm and the mean penetration is 0.67 mm\n【121】 ### Monitoring\n【122】 - There is limited information regarding Lutetium lu 177 dotatate Monitoring in the drug label\n【123】 # IV Compatibility\n【124】 - Lutetium lu 177 dotatate is an intravenous injection\n【125】 # Overdosage\n【126】 - There is limited information regarding Lutetium lu 177 dotatate overdosage.  If you suspect drug poisoning or overdose, please contact the National Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) immediately\n【127】 # Pharmacology\n【128】 ## Mechanism of Action\n【129】 - Lutetium Lu 177 dotatate binds to somatostatin receptors with highest affinity for subtype 2 receptors (SSRT2). Upon binding to somatostatin receptor expressing cells, including malignant somatostatin receptor-positive tumors, the compound is internalized. The beta emission from Lu 177 induces cellular damage by formation of free radicals in somatostatin receptor-positive cells and in neighboring cells\n【130】 ## Structure\n【131】 - Lutetium Lu 177 dotatate is a radiolabeled somatostatin analog. The drug substance lutetium Lu 177 dotatate is a cyclic peptide linked with the covalently bound chelator 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid to a radionuclide\n【132】 - Lutetium Lu 177 dotatate is described as lutetium (Lu 177)-N--D-phenylalanyl-L-cysteinyl-L-tyrosyl-D-tryptophanyl-L-lysyl-L-threoninyl-L-cysteinyl-L-threonine-cyclic  disulfide. The molecular weight is 1609.6 Daltons and the structural formula is as follows:\n【133】 - Lutetium (Lu 177) decays to shafnium (Hf 177) with a half-life of 6.647 days, by emitting beta radiation with a maximum energy of 0.498 MeV and photonic radiation (γ) of 0.208 MeV (11%) and 0.113 MeV (6.4%)\n【134】 ## Pharmacodynamics\n【135】 - Lutetium Lu 177 exposure-response relationships and the time course of pharmacodynamics response are unknown\n【136】 - Cardiac Electrophysiology\n【137】 - The ability of lutetium Lu 177 dotatate to prolong the QTc interval at the therapeutic dose was assessed in an open label study in 20 patients with somatostatin receptor-positive midgut carcinoid tumors. No large changes in the mean QTc interval (i.e., >20 ms) were detected\n【138】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n【139】 - The pharmacokinetics (PK) of lutetium Lu 177 dotatate have been characterized in patients with progressive, somatostatin receptor-positive neuroendocrine tumors. The mean blood exposure (AUC) of lutetium Lu 177 dotatate at the recommended dose is 41 ng.h/mL . The mean maximum blood concentration (C max) for lutetium Lu 177 dotatate is 10 ng/mL (CV 50%), which generally occurred at the end of the lutetium Lu 177 dotatate infusion\n【140】 - Distribution\n【141】 - The mean volume of distribution for lutetium Lu 177 dotatate is 460 L (CV 54%)\n【142】 - Within 4 hours after administration, lutetium Lu 177 dotatate distributes in kidneys, tumor lesions, liver, spleen, and, in some patients, pituitary gland and thyroid. The co-administration of amino acids reduced the median radiation dose to the kidneys by 47% (34% to 59%) and increased the mean beta-phase blood clearance of lutetium Lu 177 dotatate by 36%\n【143】 - The non-radioactive form of lutetium dotatate is 43% bound to human plasma proteins\n【144】 - Elimination\n【145】 - The mean clearance (CL) is 4.5 L/h (CV 31%) for lutetium Lu 177 dotatate. The mean (± standard deviation) effective blood elimination half-life is 3.5 (±1.4) hours and the mean terminal blood half-life is 71 (± 28) hours\n【146】 - Metabolism\n【147】 - Lutetium Lu 177 dotatate does not undergo hepatic metabolism\n【148】 - Excretion\n【149】 - Lutetium Lu 177 dotatate is primarily eliminated renally with cumulative excretion of 44% within 5 hours, 58% within 24 hours, and 65% within 48 hours following lutetium Lu 177 dotatate administration. Prolonged elimination of lutetium Lu 177 dotatate in the urine is expected; however, based on the half-life of lutetium 177 and terminal half-life of lutetium Lu 177 dotatate, greater than 99% will be eliminated within 14 days after administration of lutetium Lu 177 dotatate\n【150】 - Drug Interaction Studies\n【151】 - The non-radioactive form of lutetium is not an inhibitor or inducer of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19 or 2D6 in vitro. It is not an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein, BCRP, OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, or OCT1 in vitro\n【152】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\n【153】 - Carcinogenicity and mutagenicity studies have not been conducted with Lutetium Lu 177 dotatate; however, radiation is a carcinogen and mutagen\n【154】 - No animal studies were conducted to determine the effects of lutetium Lu 177 dotatate on fertility\n【155】 - The primary target organ in animal studies using a non-radioactive form of lutetium Lu 177 dotatate (lutetium Lu 175 dotatate) was the pancreas, a high SSTR2 expressing organ. Pancreatic acinar apoptosis occurred at lutetium Lu 175 dotatate doses ≥ 5 mg/kg in repeat dose toxicology studies in rats. Pancreatic acinar cell atrophy also occurred in repeat dose toxicology studies in dogs at doses ≥ 500 mg/kg. These findings were consistent with high uptake of the radiolabeled peptide in the pancreas in animal biodistribution studies\n【156】 # Clinical Studies\n【157】 - The efficacy of lutetium Lu 177 dotatate in patients with progressive, well-differentiated, locally advanced/inoperable or metastatic somatostatin receptor-positive midgut carcinoid tumors was established in NETTER-1 (NCT01578239), a randomized, multicenter, open-label, active-controlled trial. Key eligibility criteria included Ki67 index ≤ 20%, Karnofsky performance status ≥ 60, confirmed presence of somatostatin receptors on all lesions (OctreoScan uptake ≥ normal liver), creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min, no prior treatment with peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT), and no prior external radiation therapy to more than 25% of the bone marrow\n【158】 - Two hundred twenty-nine  patients were randomized (1:1) to receive either lutetium Lu 177 dotatate 7.4 GBq (200 mCi) every 8 weeks for up to 4 administrations (maximum cumulative dose of 29.6 GBq) or high-dose long-acting octreotide (defined as 60 mg by intramuscular injection every 4 weeks). Patients in the lutetium Lu 177 dotatate arm also received long-acting octreotide 30 mg as an intramuscular injection 4 to 24 hours after each lutetium Lu 177 dotatate dose and every 4 weeks after completion of lutetium Lu 177 dotatate treatment until disease progression or until week 76 of the study. Patients in both arms could receive short-acting octreotide for symptom management; however, short-acting octreotide was withheld for at least 24 hours before each lutetium Lu 177 dotatate dose. Randomization was stratified by OctreoScan tumor uptake score (Grade 2, 3 or 4) and the length of time that patients had been on the most recent constant dose of octreotide prior to randomization (≤ 6 or > 6 months). The major efficacy outcome measure was progression free survival (PFS) as determined by a blinded independent radiology committee (IRC) per RECIST v1.1. Additional efficacy outcome measures were overall response rate (ORR) by IRC, duration of response, and overall survival (OS)\n【159】 - Demographic and baseline disease characteristics were balanced between the treatment arms. Of the 208 patients, whose race/ethnicity was reported, 90% were White, 5% were Black, and 4% were Hispanic or Latino. The median age was 64 years (28 to 87 years); 51% were male, 74% had an illial primary, and 96% had metastatic disease in the liver. The median Karnofsky performance score was 90 (60 to 100), 74% received a constant dose of octreotide for > 6 months and 12% received prior treatment with everolimus. Sixty-nine percent of patients had Ki67 expression in ≤ 2% of tumor cells, 77% had CgA > 2 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), 65% had 5-HIAA > 2 x ULN, and 65% had alkaline phosphatase ≤ ULN. Efficacy results for NETTER-1 are presented in  and\n【160】 - The efficacy of lutetium Lu 177 dotatate in patients with foregut, midgut, and hindgut gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) was assessed in 360 patients in the ERASMUS study. In ERASMUS, lutetium Lu 177 dotatate was initially provided as expanded access under a general peptide receptor radionuclide therapy protocol at a single site in the Netherlands. A subsequent lutetium Lu 177 dotatate-specific protocol written eight years after study initiation did not describe a specific sample size or hypothesis testing plan but allowed for retrospective data collection. A total of 1214 patients received lutetium Lu 177 dotatate in ERASMUS, of which 601 (50%) were assessed per RECIST criteria. Of the 601 patients evaluated by investigators using RECIST criteria, 360 (60%) had gastroentero-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs). Lutetium Lu 177 dotatate 7.4 GBq (200 mCi) was administered every 6 to 13 weeks for up to 4 doses concurrently with the recommended amino acid solution. The major efficacy outcome was investigator-assessed ORR. The median age in the efficacy subset was 61 years (25 to 88 years), 52% were male, 61% had a baseline Karnofsky performance status ≥ 90 (60 to 100), 60% had progressed within 12 months of treatment, and 15% had received prior chemotherapy. Fifty five percent (55%) of patients received a concomitant somatostatin analog. The median dose of lutetium Lu 177 dotatate was 29.6 GBq (800 mCi). Baseline tumor assessments were obtained in 39% of patients. The investigator assessed ORR was 16% (95% CI 13, 20) in the 360 patients with GEP-NETs. Three complete responses were observed (< 1%). Median DoR in the 58 responding patients was 35 months (95% CI: 17, 38)\n【161】 # How Supplied\n【162】 - Lutetium Lu 177 dotatate Injection containing 370 MBq/mL (10 mCi/ml) of lutetium Lu 177 dotatate is a sterile, preservative-free and clear, colorless to slightly yellow solution for intravenous use supplied in a colorless Type I glass 30 mL single-dose vial containing 7.4 GBq (200 mCi) ± 10% of lutetium Lu 177 dotatate at the time of injection (NDC# 69488-003-01).

Adenomyomatosis is most often an incidental finding, has no intrinsic malignant potential, and usually requires no treatment. Cholesterolosis, the other hyperplastic cholecystosis, consists of deposition of triglycerides and cholesterol esters within the lamina propria, producing a characteristic gross appearance known as \"strawberry gallbladder.\" Cholesterol accumulation in adenomyomatosis is intraluminal, as cholesterol crystals precipitate in the bile trapped in Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses (intramural diverticula lined by mucosal epithelium)\n【3】 # Classification\n【4】 - Gallbladder involvement by adenomyomatous hyperplasia is variable in extent and location, with heterogeneous imaging appearances corresponding to diffuse, segmental, and focal adenomyomatosis\n【5】 - Exclusion of  may be most problematic in segmental and focal cases\n【6】 - Focal adenomyomatosis may appear as a discrete mass, known as an adenomyoma\n【7】 # Diagnosis\n【8】 ## Ultrasound\n【9】 - Echogenic intramural foci from which emanate V-shaped comet tail reverberation artifacts  are highly specific for adenomyomatosis, representing the unique acoustic signature of cholesterol crystals within the lumina of Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses\n【10】 - Patient #1\n【11】 ## CT\n【12】 - Abnormal gallbladder wall thickening and enhancement are common but nonspecific CT features of adenomyomatosis\n【13】 - Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses of sufficient size can be visualized; a CT rosary sign has been described, formed by enhancing epithelium within intramural diverticula surrounded by the relatively unenhanced hypertrophied gallbladder muscularis\n【14】 # MRI\n【15】 - The pearl necklace sign alludes to the characteristically curvilinear arrangement of multiple rounded hyperintense intraluminal cavities visualized at T2-weighted MR imaging and MR cholangiopancreatography of adenomyomatosis\n【16】 - Patient #2: MRI images demonstrate adenomyomatosis at the gallbladder fundus\n【17】 - T2 SSFSE\n【18】 - LAVA post GAD\n【19】 - T2 fat sat\n【20】 - Metabolic characterization with PET may be a useful adjunct in problematic cases", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-15 17:51:29", "update_time": "2024-04-15 21:30:53"}

It also provides rapid relief of hypersensitivity reactions to drugs and other allergens, prolongs the action of anesthetics, and may be used as a hemostatic agent.  Its cardiac effects may be of use in restoring cardiac rhythm in cardiac arrest due to various causes, but it is not used in cardiac failure or in hemorrhagic, traumatic, or cardiogenic shock.   Common adverse reactions include palpitations, pallor, sweating, nausea, vomiting, asthenia, dizziness, headache, tremor, anxiety, restlessness, and dyspnea\n【5】 # Adult Indicationsand Dosage\n【6】 # FDA-Labeled Indicationsand Dosage( Adult)\n【7】 - Dosing Information\n【8】 - For bronchial asthma and certain allergic manifestations, e.g., angioedema, urticaria, serum sickness, anaphylactic shock, use epinephrine subcutaneously. The adult intravenous dose for hypersensitivity reactions or to relieve bronchospasm usually ranges from 0.1 to 0.25 mg injected slowly. Neonates may be given a dose of 0.01 mg per kg of body weight; for the infant 0.05 mg is an adequate initial dose and this may be repeated at 20 to 30 minute intervals in the management of asthma attacks\n【9】 - A dose of 0.5 mL (0.5 mg) diluted to 10 mL with sodium chloride injection can be administered intravenously or intracardially to restore myocardial contractility\n【10】 - Intracardiac injection should only be administered by personnel well trained in the technique, if there has not been sufficient time to establish an intravenous route\n【11】 - External cardiac massage should follow intracardial administration to permit the drug to enter coronary circulation. The drug should be used secondarily to unsuccessful attempts with physical or electromechanical methods\n【12】 - Ophthalmologic use (for producing conjunctival decongestion, to control hemorrhage, produce mydriasis and reduce intraocular pressure) — use a concentration of 1:10,000 (0.1 mg/mL) to 1:1000 (1 mg/mL)\n【13】 - A final concentration of 1:200,000 of epinephrine injection is recommended for infiltration injection, nerve block, caudal or other epidural blocks. From 0.3 to 0.4 mg of epinephrine (0.3 to 0.4 mL of 1:1000 solution) may be mixed with spinal anesthetic agents\n【14】 - Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration\n【15】 # Off-Label Useand Dosage( Adult)\n【16】 # Guideline-Supported Use\n【17】 - Developed by: ACC/AHA\n【18】 - Class of Recommendation: Class IIb\n【19】 - Strength of Evidence: Category B\n【20】 - If atropine is ineffective for the treatment of bradycardia with a pulse, then epinephrine or dopamine may be used, especially, with associated hypotension\n【21】 # Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n【22】 - Endoscopic injection of epinephrine is effective in the treatment of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage\n【23】 # Pediatric Indicationsand Dosage\n【24】 # FDA-Labeled Indicationsand Dosage( Pediatric)\n【25】 - There is limited information regarding FDA-Labeled Use of Epinephrine (injection) in pediatric patients\n【26】 # Off-Label Useand Dosage( Pediatric)\n【27】 # Guideline-Supported Use\n【28】 - There is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Epinephrine (injection) in pediatric patients\n【29】 # Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n【30】 - Aerosolized levo-epinephrine (1:1000) is at least as effective as racemic epinephrine (2.25%) in the treatment of laryngotracheitis in children (6 months to 6 years of age) with moderate to severe croup\n【31】 - Subcutaneous epinephrine is effective in the treatment of acute wheezing in children less than 2 years of age\n【32】 # Contraindications\n【33】 - Epinephrine is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to sympathomimetic amines, in patients with angle closure glaucoma, and patients in shock (nonanaphylactic). It should not be used in patients anesthetized with agents such as cyclopropane or halothane as these may sensitize the heart to the arrhythmic action of sympathomimetic drugs\n【34】 - Addition of epinephrine to local anesthetics for injection of certain areas (e.g., fingers, toes, ears, etc.) is contraindicated because of danger that vasoconstriction may result in sloughing of tissue\n【35】 - Except as diluted for admixture with local anesthetics to reduce absorption and prolong action, epinephrine should not ordinarily be used in those cases where vasopressor drugs may be contraindicated, e.g., in thyrotoxicosis, diabetes, in obstetrics when maternal blood pressure is in excess of 130/80 and in hypertension and other cardiovascular disorders\n【36】 # Warnings\n【37】 - Inadvertently induced high arterial blood pressure may result in angina pectoris, aortic rupture or cerebral hemorrhage\n【38】 - Epinephrine may induce potentially serious cardiac arrhythmias in patients not suffering from heart disease and in patients with organic heart disease or who are receiving drugs that sensitize the myocardium\n【39】 - Parenterally administered epinephrine initially may produce constriction of renal blood vessels and decrease urine formation\n【40】 - Epinephrine Injection, USP is subject to oxidation and should be protected against exposure to light and stored in light-resistant containers\n【41】 - Epinephrine is the preferred treatment for serious allergic or other emergency situations even though this product contains sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may in other products cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms or life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible persons. The alternatives to using epinephrine in a life-threatening situation may not be satisfactory. The presence of a sulfite in this product should not deter administration of the drug for treatment of serious allergic or other emergency situations\n【42】 ### Precautions\n【43】 - Do not use the Injection if its color is pinkish or darker than slightly yellow or if it contains a precipitate\n【44】 - Do not administer unless solution is clear and container is intact. Discard unused portion\n【45】 - Although epinephrine can produce ventricular fibrillation, its actions in restoring electrical activity in asystole and in enhancing defibrillation of the fibrillating ventricle are well documented. The drug, however, should be used with caution in patients with ventricular fibrillation\n【46】 - Epinephrine should be used cautiously in patients with hyperthyroidism, hypertension and cardiac arrhythmias. All vasopressors should be used cautiously in patients taking monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors\n【47】 # Adverse Reactions\n【48】 # Clinical Trials Experience\n【49】 - There is limited information regarding Clinical Trial Experience of Epinephrine (injection) in the drug label\n【50】 ## Postmarketing Experience\n【51】 - Transient and minor side effects of anxiety, headache, fear and palpitations occur only with systemic therapeutic doses, especially in hyperthyroid individuals. Adverse effects such as cardiac arrhythmias and excessive rise in blood pressure may occur with systemic therapeutic doses or with inadvertent overdosage. Other adverse reactions include cerebral hemorrhage, hemiplegia, subarachnoid hemorrhage, anginal pain in patients with angina pectoris, anxiety, restlessness, headache, tremor, weakness, dizziness, pallor and respiratory difficulty. Such reactions are unlikely when epinephrine is diluted to 1:200,000 for injection with local anesthetic agents\n【52】 # Drug Interactions\n【53】 - Epinephrine should not be administered concomitantly with other sympathomimetic drugs (such as isoproterenol) because of possible additive effects and increased toxicity. Combined effects may induce serious cardiac arrhythmias. They may be administered alternately when the preceding effect of other such drugs has subsided\n【54】 - Administration of epinephrine to patients receiving cyclopropane or halogenated hydrocarbon general anesthetics such as halothane which sensitize the myocardium, may induce cardiac arrhythmia. When encountered, such arrhythmias may respond to administration of a beta-adrenergic blocking drug. Epinephrine also should be used cautiously with other drugs (e.g., digitalis glycosides) that sensitize the myocardium to the actions of sympathomimetic agents\n【55】 - Diuretic agents may decrease vascular response to pressor drugs such as epinephrine\n【56】 - Epinephrine may antagonize the neuron blockade produced by guanethidine resulting in decreased antihypertensive effect and requiring increased dosage of the latter\n【57】 # Usein Specific Populations\n【58】 ### Pregnancy\n【59】 - Pregnancy Category (FDA):\n【60】 - Pregnancy Category C\n【61】 - Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with epinephrine. It is also not known whether epinephrine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Epinephrine should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed\n【62】 - Pregnancy Category (AUS):\n【63】 - Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) Pregnancy Category\n【64】 - There is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Epinephrine (injection) in women who are pregnant\n【65】 ### Labor and Delivery\n【66】 - Parenteral administration of epinephrine if used to support blood pressure during low or other spinal anesthesia for delivery can cause acceleration of fetal heart rate and should not be used in obstetrics when maternal blood pressure exceeds 130/80\n【67】 ### Nursing Mothers\n【68】 - There is no FDA guidance on the use of Epinephrine (injection) with respect to nursing mothers\n【69】 ### Pediatric Use\n【70】 - There is no FDA guidance on the use of Epinephrine (injection) with respect to pediatric patients\n【71】 ### Geriatic Use\n【72】 - There is no FDA guidance on the use of Epinephrine (injection) with respect to geriatric patients\n【73】 ### Gender\n【74】 - There is no FDA guidance on the use of Epinephrine (injection) with respect to specific gender populations\n【75】 ### Race\n【76】 - There is no FDA guidance on the use of Epinephrine (injection) with respect to specific racial populations\n【77】 ### Renal Impairment\n【78】 - There is no FDA guidance on the use of Epinephrine (injection) in patients with renal impairment\n【79】 ### Hepatic Impairment\n【80】 - There is no FDA guidance on the use of Epinephrine (injection) in patients with hepatic impairment\n【81】 # Femalesof Reproductive Potentialand Males\n【82】 - There is no FDA guidance on the use of Epinephrine (injection) in women of reproductive potentials and males\n【83】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\n【84】 - There is no FDA guidance one the use of Epinephrine (injection) in patients who are immunocompromised\n【85】 # Administration and Monitoring\n【86】 ### Administration\n【87】 - Intracardial\n【88】 - Intravenous\n【89】 - Subcutaneous\n【90】 ### Monitoring\n【91】 - There is limited information regarding Monitoring of Epinephrine (injection) in the drug label\n【92】 # IV Compatibility\n【93】 - There is limited information regarding IV Compatibility of Epinephrine (injection) in the drug label\n【94】 # Overdosage\n【95】 ## Acute Overdose\n【96】 ### Signs and Symptoms\n【97】 - Erroneous administration of large doses of epinephrine may lead to precordial distress, vomiting, headache, dyspnea, as well as unusually elevated blood pressure\n【98】 ### Management\n【99】 - Toxic effects of overdosage can be counteracted by injection of an alpha-adrenergic blocker and a beta-adrenergic blocker. In the event of a sharp rise in blood pressure, rapid-acting vasodilators such as the nitrites, or alpha-adrenergic blocking agents can be given to counteract the marked pressor effect of large doses of epinephrine\n【100】 ## Chronic Overdose\n【101】 - There is limited information regarding Chronic Overdose of Epinephrine (injection) in the drug label\n【102】 # Pharmacology\n【103】 ## Mechanism of Action\n【104】 - The actions of epinephrine resemble the effects of stimulation of adrenergic nerves. To a variable degree it acts on both alpha and beta receptor sites of sympathetic effector cells. Its most prominent actions are on the beta receptors of the heart, vascular and other smooth muscle. When given by rapid intravenous injection, it produces a rapid rise in blood pressure, mainly systolic, by  direct stimulation of cardiac muscle which increases the strength of ventricular contraction,  increasing the heart rate and  constriction of the arterioles in the skin, mucosa and splanchnic areas of the circulation\n【105】 - When given by slow intravenous injection epinephrine usually produces only a moderate rise in systolic and a fall in diastolic pressure. Although some increase in pulse pressure occurs, there is usually no great elevation in mean blood pressure. Accordingly, the compensatory reflex mechanisms that come into play with a pronounced increase in blood pressure do not antagonize the direct cardiac actions of epinephrine as much as with catecholamines that have a predominant action on alpha receptors\n【106】 - Total peripheral resistance decreases by action of epinephrine on beta receptors of the skeletal muscle vasculature and blood flow is thereby enhanced. Usually this vasodilator effect of the drug on the circulation predominates so that the modest rise in systolic pressure which follows slow injection or absorption is mainly the result of direct cardiac stimulation and increase in cardiac output. In some instances peripheral resistance is not altered or may even rise owing to a greater ratio of alpha to beta activity in different vascular areas\n【107】 - Epinephrine relaxes the smooth muscles of the bronchi and iris and is a physiologic antagonist of histamine. The drug also produces an increase in blood sugar and glycogenolysis in the liver\n【108】 - Intravenous injection produces an immediate and intensified response. Following intravenous injection epinephrine disappears rapidly from the blood stream\n【109】 ## Structure\n【110】 - Epinephrine Injection, USP 1:1000 is a sterile, nonpyrogenic solution. Each mL contains epinephrine 1 mg; sodium chloride 9 mg; sodium metabisulfite 0.9 mg added. May contain hydrochloric acid for pH adjustment\n【111】 - The solution contains no bacteriostat or antimicrobial agent. It is administered by the following routes: intravenous, intracardiac (left ventricular chamber), via endotracheal tube into the bronchial tree, subcutaneous or intramuscular\n【112】 - Epinephrine, USP is a sympathomimetic (adrenergic) agent designated chemically as 4--1,2 benzenediol, a white, microcrystalline powder. It has the following structural formula:\n【113】 - Sodium Chloride, USP is chemically designated NaCl, a white, crystalline compound freely soluble in water\n【114】 ## Pharmacodynamics\n【115】 - There is limited information regarding Pharmacodynamics of Epinephrine (injection) in the drug label\n【116】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n【117】 - Epinephrine is rapidly inactivated in the body and is degraded by enzymes in the liver and other tissues\n【118】 - The large portion of injection doses is excreted in the urine as inactivated compounds. The remainder is excreted in the urine as unchanged or conjugated compounds\n【119】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\n【120】 - There is limited information regarding Nonclinical Toxicology of Epinephrine (injection) in the drug label\n【121】 # Clinical Studies\n【122】 - There is limited information regarding Clinical Studies of Epinephrine (injection) in the drug label\n【123】 # How Supplied\n【124】 - Epinephrine Injection, USP 1:1000 (1 mg/mL) is supplied in a 1 mL ampul single-dose container (NDC 0409-7241-25)\n【125】 - Store at 20 to 25°C (68 to 77°F)\n【126】 - Protect from light\n【127】 ## Storage\n【128】 - There is limited information regarding Epinephrine (injection) Storage in the drug label\n【129】 # Images\n【130】 ## Drug Images\n【131】 # Packageand Label Display Panel\n【132】 # Patient Counseling Information\n【133】 - There is limited information regarding Patient Counseling Information of Epinephrine (injection) in the drug label\n【134】 # Precautions with Alcohol\n【135】 - Alcohol-Epinephrine (injection) interaction has not been established.

Its aim is twofold: to reduce the risk of harm from healthcare-associated infections for patients, staff and visitors; and to reduce the costs associated with preveninfection\n【2】 # Introduction\n【3】 - Following a referral from the Department of Health, NICE, in partnership with Public Health England (PHE), have developed this quality improvement guide. The guide offers advice on management or organisational actions to prevent and control healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs) in secondary care settings\n【4】 - The guide is aimed at board members working in (or with) secondary care. It may also be of use to senior managers, those working elsewhere in the NHS, as well as those working in local authorities and the wider public, private, voluntary and community sectors\n【5】 - In producing this guide, NICE and PHE have assumed that all secondary care settings are compliant with the current code of practice on preventing and controlling infections (Department of Health's Health and Social Care Act 2008: Code of practice on the prevention and control of infections)\n【6】 - The guide aims to help build on advice given in the code and elsewhere to improve the quality of care and practice in these areas over and above current standards. Taken together, the quality improvement statements contained in this guide describe excellence in care and practice to prevent and control HCAIs. Examples of evidence and other data to demonstrate progress against each statement are provided\n【7】 - NICE and PHE recognise that a range of factors associated with infection prevention and control have the potential to impact on health inequalities (for example, in relation to age, ethnicity, gender and disability). However, the relative impact of different factors will vary for different organisations. NICE and PHE expect trusts and other secondary care organisations to consider local issues in relation to health inequalities when implementing this guide\n【8】 # What is a healthcare-associated infection?\n【9】 - Healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs) can develop either as a direct result of healthcare interventions such as medical or surgical treatment, or from being in contact with a healthcare setting\n【10】 - The term HCAI covers a wide range of infections. The most well known include those caused by meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), meticillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) and Escherichia coli (E. coli). HCAIs cover any infection contracted:\n【11】 - as a direct result of treatment in, or contact with, a health or social care setting\n【12】 - as a result of healthcare delivered in the community\n【13】 - utside a healthcare setting (for example, in the community) and brought in by patients, staff or visitors and transmitted to others (for example, norovirus)\n【14】 - HCAIs pose a serious risk to patients, staff and visitors. They can incur significant costs for the NHS and cause significant morbidity to those infected. As a result, infection prevention and control is a key priority for the NHS (Department of Health's board to ward: How to embed a culture of HCAI prevention in acute trusts)\n【15】 # What action has been taken?\n【16】 - Following National Audit Office reports highlighting concerns about HCAIs, the Department of Health introduced a range of policies and measures designed to reduce rates of infection. (National Audit Office  The management and control of hospital acquired infection in acute NHS trusts in England; National Audit Office  Improving patient care by reducing the risk of hospital acquired infection: a progress report.)\n【17】 - For example, mandatory surveillance for meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was introduced in 2001. In 2004, a target was introduced to reduce MRSA bloodstream infections by 50% by 2008 in all NHS acute and foundation trusts. With the introduction of the Health Act in 2006, for the first time it became a legal requirement to have systems in place to minimise the risk of HCAIs (Department of Health's Health Act 2006: code of practice for the prevention and control of healthcare associated infections)\n【18】 # What action is needed now?\n【19】 - The 2009 National Audit Office report on reducing healthcare associated infections in hospitals in England identified four systemic issues that still needed to be tackled locally and nationally to reduce infection rates. It highlighted the need:\n【20】 - for a culture of continuous improvement\n【21】 - for a whole-system approach, with clear structures, roles and responsibilities\n【22】 - to ensure staff compliance with good infection control practice\n【23】 - to monitor and record hospital prescriptions and the use of antibiotics\n【24】 # What is this guide for?\n【25】 - This guide will help secondary care and other healthcare organisations improve the quality of care and practice, reduce the risk of harm from HCAIs to patients, staff and visitors and reduce the costs associated with preveninfection. The 11 quality improvement statements provide clear markers of excellence in infection prevention and control at a management or organisational level. Each statement is supported by examples of the type of evidence that could be used to prove the organisation has achieved excellence, and examples of what this would mean in practice on a day-to-day basis\n【26】 - The aim is to help boards:\n【27】 - assess current practice in relation to the prevention of HCAIs\n【28】 - identify areas for quality improvement\n【29】 - monitor progress\n【30】 - provide leadership and support to infection prevention and control teams and other staff working to implement the guide\n【31】 - The guide may also help inform investment decisions\n【32】 - It will also give patients and the public information about the quality of care they can expect, and how secondary care organisations can improve patient safety and outcomes by improving quality in key areas\n【33】 # How should the guide be used?\n【34】 - This guide is not mandatory. Rather, each quality improvement statement describes a level of excellence that could be achieved to prevent and control infections. Key areas of practice that underpin infection prevention and control, such as hand hygiene, antimicrobial stewardship and environmental cleanliness are included as measures and examples, where appropriate\n【35】 - Organisations wishing to use the guide for quality assessment and improvement may choose a selection of the most appropriate measures for their setting as potential evidence of achievement. In organisations where, for example, tertiary care services are provided alongside secondary care, senior management should consider the applicability of each statement to their setting\n【36】 - The examples of measures that could be taken may not be appropriate in all cases – and secondary care organisations may identify and use alternate measures as evidence of achievement, as necessary\n【37】 - Performance in each statement area will depend upon healthcare professionals and other trust staff who have HCAI prevention and control – and public health, generally – as part of their remit\n【38】 - Much of the information required to support the measures is already available and a range of other guidance can be used alongside this guide to assess and improve quality in secondary care settings. Overlaps between the statements and certain aspects of the code of practice are highlighted. In addition, where data routinely collated may help trusts monitor progress in an area covered by one of the statements, this is also highlighted\n【39】 # How was the guide developed?\n【40】 - This guide was developed as a pilot project, based on processes and methods used by NICE to develop other types of guidance. A topic expert group was set up and led by an independent chair. It consisted of practitioners from the NHS, local authorities and the voluntary sector, as well as academics and patient and public representatives. The group worked with NICE and PHE to develop the guide\n【41】 - The resulting quality improvement statements are based on recommendations from seven source guidance documents. They have been refined as a result of stakeholder consultation and committee discussion\n【42】 - The following documents provide further information on the referral, scope, and methodology used as the basis for this guide:\n【43】 - Advice on the prevention and control of healthcare-associated infections: scope – this sets out the referral and scope for the work\n【44】 - Quality improvement guide – prevention and control of healthcare-associated infections: topic briefing paper - this summarises the methods and process used to develop this guide and lists the source documents# Quality improvement statement 1: Board-level leadership to prevent HCAIs\n【45】 # Statement\n【46】 - Trust boards demonstrate leadership in infection prevention and control to ensure a culture of continuous quality improvement and to minimise risk to patients\n【47】 # What does this mean for people visiting, or receiving treatment in, hospitals?\n【48】 - People visiting, or receiving treatment in, hospitals can expect all trust staff – from board to ward level – to take responsibility, and be accounfor, continuous quality improvement in relation to infection prevention and control\n【49】 # What does it mean for trust boards?\n【50】 - Boards are proactive in ensuring continuous quality improvement by leading on, and regularly monitoring compliance with, all relevant infection prevention and control objectives, policies and procedures\n【51】 # Evidence of achievement\n【52】 .

This includes not only the usually known white matter demyelination, but also demyelination in the cortex and deep gray matter (GM) nuclei, as well as diffuse injury of the normal-appearing white matter. GM atrophy is independent of the MS lesions and is associated with physical disability, fatigue, and cognitive impairment in MS\n【3】 # Demyelination process\n【4】 - According to the view of most researchers, a special subset of lymphocytes, called T cells, plays a key role in the development of MS. Under normal circumstances, these lymphocytes can distinguish between self and non-self. However, in a person with MS, these cells recognize healthy parts of the central nervous system as foreign and attack them as if they were an invading virus, triggering inflammatory processes and stimulating other immune cells and soluble factors like cytokines and antibodies\n【5】 - Normally, there is a tight barrier between the blood and brain, called the blood-brain barrier, built up of endothelial cells lining the blood vessel walls. It should prevent the passage of antibodies through it, but in MS patients it does not work. A deficiency of uric acid has been implicated in this process. Uric acid added in physiological concentrations (i.e. achieving normal concentrations) is therapeutic in MS by preventing the breakdown of the blood brain barrier through inactivation of peroxynitrite. The low level of uric acid found in MS victims is manifestedly causative rather than a consequence of tissue damage in the white matter lesions, but not in the grey matter lesions. Nevertheless, whether BBB dysfunction is the cause or the consequence of MS is still disputed,because activated T-Cells can cross a healthy BBB when they express adhesion proteins\n【6】 - According to a strictly immunological explanation of MS, the inflammatory processes triggered by the T cells create leaks in the blood-brain barrier. These leaks, in turn, cause a number of other damaging effects such as swelling, activation of macrophages, and more activation of cytokines and other destructive proteins such as matrix metalloproteinases. The final result is destruction of myelin, called demyelination\n【7】 - Repair processes, called remyelination, also play an important role in MS. Remyelination is one of the reasons why, especially in early phases of the disease, symptoms tend to decrease or disappear temporarily. Nevertheless, nerve damage and irreversible loss of neurons occur early in MS\n【8】 - Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy has shown that there is widespread neuronal loss even at the onset of MS, largely unrelated to inflammation\n【9】 - Often, the brain is able to compensate for some of this damage, due to an ability called neuroplasticity. MS symptoms develop as the cumulative result of multiple lesions in the brain and spinal cord. This is why symptoms can vary greatly between different individuals, depending on where their lesions occur\n【10】 - The oligodendrocytes that originally formed a myelin sheath cannot completely rebuild a destroyed myelin sheath. However, the central nervous system can recruit oligodendrocyte stem cells capable of proliferation and migration and differentiation into mature myelinating oligodendrocytes. The newly-formed myelin sheaths are thinner and often not as effective as the original ones. Repeated attacks lead to successively fewer effective remyelinations, until a scar-like plaque is built up around the damaged axons. Under laboratory conditions, stem cells are quite capable of proliferating and differentiating into remyelinating oligodendrocytes; it is therefore suspected that inflammatory conditions or axonal damage somehow inhibit stem cell proliferation and differentiation in affected areas\n【11】 # Demyelination patterns\n【12】 - Also known as Lassmann patterns, it is believed that they may correlate with differences in disease type and prognosis, and perhaps with different responses to treatment. This report suggests that there may be several types of MS with different immune-related causes, and that MS may be a family of several diseases\n【13】 - The four identified patterns are :\n【14】 - The meaning of this fact is controversial. For some investigation teams it means that MS is a heterogeneous disease. Others maintain that the shape of the scars can change with time from one type to other and this could be a marker of the disease evolution\n【15】 ## Correlation with clinical courses\n【16】 - No definitive relationship between these patterns and the clinical subtypes has been established by now, but some relations have been established. All the cases with PPMS (primary progressive) had pattern IV (oligodendrocyte degeneration) in the original study  and nobody with RRMS was found with this pattern. Balo concentric sclerosis lesions have been classified as pattern III (distal oligodendrogliopathy). Neuromyelitis optica was associated with pattern II (complement mediated demyelination), though they show a perivascular distribution, at difference from MS pattern II lesions\n【17】 # Correlationwith MRIfindings\n【18】 - The researchers are attempting this with magnetic resonance images to confirm their initial findings of different patterns of immune pathology and any evidence of possible disease “sub-types” of underlying pathologies. It is possible that such “sub-types” of MS may evolve differently over time and may respond differently to the same therapies.  Ultimately investigators could identify which individuals would do best with which treatments\n【19】 - It seems that Pulsed magnetization transfer imaging , diffusion Tensor MRI  and VCAM-1 enhanced MRI  could be able to show the pathological differences of these patterns\n【20】 # Correlationwith CSFfindings\n【21】 - Teams in Oxford and Germany,   found correlation with CSF and progression in November 2001, and hypothesis have been made suggesting correlation between CSF findings and pathophysiological patterns. In particular, B-cell to monocyte ratio looks promising. The anti-MOG antibody has been investigated but no utility as biomarker has been found , though this is disputed. High levels of anti-nuclear antibodies are found normally in patients with MS. Antibobies against Neurofascin–186 could be involved in a subtype of MS\n【22】 ## Response to therapy\n【23】 - The heterogeneous response to therapy can support the idea of hetherogeneous aetiology\n【24】 - Pattern II lesions patients are responsive to plasmapheresis, while others are not\n【25】 - The subtype associated with macrophage activation, T cell infiltration and expression of inflammatory mediator molecules may be most likely responsive to immunomodulation with interferon-beta or glatiramer acetate\n【26】 - People non-responsive to interferons are the most responsive to Copaxone\n【27】 # Blood-brain barrier disruption\n【28】 - A healthy blood-brain barrier shouldn't allow T-cells to enter the nervous system. Therefore BBB disruption has always been considered one of the early problems in the MS lesions. Recently it has been found that this happens even in non-enhancing lesions, and it has been found with iron oxide nanoparticles how macrophages produce the BBB disruption\n【29】 - Abnormal tight junctions are present in both SPMS and PPMS. They appear in active white matter lesions and in NAGM in SPMS. They persist in inactive lesions, particularly in PPMS\n【30】 - Apart from that, activated T-Cells can cross a healthy BBB when they express adhesion proteins\n【31】 - Haemodinamics of the lesions has been messured and distortion has been found related to plaques distribution. It was meassured through transcranial color-coded duplex sonography (TCCS)\n【32】 # Neural and axonal damage\n【33】 - The axons of the neurons are damaged by the attacks or its byproducts. Currently no relationship has been established with the relapses or the attacks\n【34】 - A relationship between neural damage and N-Acetyl-Aspartat concentration has been stablished, and this could lead to new methods for early MS diagnostic through magnetic resonance spectroscopy\n【35】 # Spinal cord damage\n【36】 - Cervical spinal cord has been found to be affected by MS even without attacks, and damage correlates with disability\n【37】 # Normal appearing brain tissues abnormalities\n【38】 - Brain normal appearing white matter (NAWM) and grey matter (NAGM) show several abnormalities under MRI. This is currently an active field of research with no definitive results. It has been found that grey matter injury correlates with disability and that there is high oxidative stress in lesions, even in the old ones\n【39】 - Cortical lesions also appear. They can be detected by double inversion recovery MRI. They have been observed specially in people with SPMS but they also appear in RRMS and clinically isolated syndrome. They are more frequent in men than in women. These lesions can partly explain cognitive deficits\n【40】 # Research\n【41】 - Until recently, most of the data available came from post-mortem brain samples and animal models of the disease, such as the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an autoimmune disease that can be induced in rodents, and which is considered a possible animal model for multiple sclerosis. However, since 1998 brain biopsies apart from the post-mortem samples were used, allowing researchers to identify the previous four different damage patterns in the scars of the brain\n【42】 # History\n【43】 - The National MS society launched The Lesion Project to classify the different lesion patterns of MS\n【44】 - Claudia F. Lucchinetti, MD from Mayo Clinic and collaborators from the U.S., Germany and Austria were chosen to conduct this study for their previous contributions in this area. They have amassed a large collection of tissue samples from people with MS through brain biopsies or autopsy. Claudia Lucchinetti was appointed director of this project. The group has reported promising findings on samples from 83 cases. They found four types of lesions, which differed in immune system activity. Within each person, all lesions were the same, but lesions differed from person to person\n【45】 - The first article about pathophysiological heterogeneity was in 1996  and has been confirmed later by several teams. Four different damage patterns have been identified by her team in the scars of the brain tissue. Understanding lesion patterns can provide information about differences in disease between individuals and enable doctors to make more accurate treatment decisions\n【46】 - According to one of the researchers involved in the original research \"Two patterns (I and II) showed close similarities to T-cell-mediated or T-cell plus antibody-mediated autoimmune encephalomyelitis, respectively. The other patterns (III and IV) were highly suggestive of a primary oligodendrocyte dystrophy, reminiscent of virus- or toxin-induced demyelination rather than autoimmunity.\"\n【47】 - Apart of this, recent achievements in related diseases, like neuromyelitis optica have shown that varieties previously suspected different from MS are in fact different diseases. In neuromyelitis optica, a team was able to identify a protein of the neurons, Aquaporin 4 as the target of the immune attack. This has been the first time that the attack mechanisme of a type of MS has been identified\n【48】 - The investigators are now trying to identify the types of cells involved with tissue destruction, and examining clinical characteristics of the individuals from whom these tissues were taken\n【49】 - The MS Lesion Project has just been renewed with a commitment of $1.2 million for three years.

The type of bleeding associated with thrombolytic therapy can be divided into two broad categories:\n【34】 - Internal bleeding, involving intracranial and retroperitoneal sites, or the gastrointestinal, genitourinary, or respiratory tracts\n【35】 - Superficial or surface bleeding, observed mainly at vascular puncture and access sites (e.g., venous cutdowns, arterial punctures) or sites of recent surgical intervention\n【36】 - Should serious bleeding (not controlled by local pressure) occur, any concomitant heparin or antiplatelet agents should be discontinued immediately\n【37】 - In clinical studies of Tenecteplase, patients were treated with both aspirin and heparin. heparin may contribute to the bleeding risks associated with Tenecteplase. The safety of the use of Tenecteplase with other antiplatelet agents has not been adequately studied. Intramuscular injections and nonessential handling of the patient should be avoided for the first few hours following treatment with Tenecteplase. Venipunctures should be performed and monitored carefully\n【38】 - Should an arterial puncture be necessary during the first few hours following Tenecteplase therapy, it is preferable to use an upper extremity vessel that is accessible to manual compression. Pressure should be applied for at least 30 minutes, a pressure dressing applied, and the puncture site checked frequently for evidence of bleeding\n【39】 - Each patient being considered for therapy with Tenecteplase should be carefully evaluated and anticipated benefits weighed against potential risks associated with therapy. In the following conditions, the risk of Tenecteplase therapy may be increased and should be weighed against the anticipated benefits:\n【40】 - Recent major surgery, e.g., coronary artery bypass graft, obstetrical delivery, organ biopsy, previous puncture of noncompressible vessels\n【41】 - Cerebrovascular disease\n【42】 - Recent gastrointestinal or genitourinary bleeding\n【43】 - Recent trauma\n【44】 - hypertension: systolic BP ≥180 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP ≥110 mm Hg\n【45】 - High likelihood of left heart thrombus, e.g., mitral stenosis with atrial fibrillation\n【46】 - Acute pericarditis\n【47】 - Subacute bacterial endocarditis\n【48】 - Hemostatic defects, including those secondary to severe hepatic or renal disease\n【49】 - Severe hepatic dysfunction\n【50】 - Pregnancy\n【51】 - Diabetic hemorrhagic retinopathy or other hemorrhagic ophthalmic conditions\n【52】 - Septic thrombophlebitis or occluded AV cannula at seriously infected site\n【53】 - Advanced age\n【54】 - Patients currently receiving oral anticoagulants, e.g., warfarin sodium\n【55】 - Recent administration of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors\n【56】 - Any other condition in which bleeding constitutes a significant hazard or would be particularly difficult to manage because of its location\n【57】 ### Cholesterol Embolization\n【58】 - Cholesterol embolism has been reported rarely in patients treated with all types of thrombolytic agents; the true incidence is unknown. This serious condition, which can be lethal, is also associated with invasive vascular procedures (e.g., cardiac catheterization, angiography, vascular surgery) and/or anticoagulant therapy. Clinical features of cholesterol embolism may include livedo reticularis, \"purple toe\" syndrome, acute renal failure, gangrenous digits, hypertension, pancreatitis, myocardial infarction, cerebral infarction, spinal cord infarction, retinal artery occlusion, bowel infarction, and rhabdomyolysis\n【59】 ### Arrhythmias\n【60】 - Coronary thrombolysis may result in arrhythmias associated with reperfusion. These arrhythmias (such as sinus bradycardia, accelerated idioventricular rhythm, ventricular premature depolarizations, ventricular tachycardia) are not different from those often seen in the ordinary course of acute myocardial infarction and may be managed with standard anti‑arrhythmic measures. It is recommended that anti‑arrhythmic therapy for bradycardia and/or ventricular irritability be available when Tenecteplase is administered\n【61】 # Usewith Percutaneous Coronary Intervention( PCI)\n【62】 - In patients with large ST segment elevation myocardial infarction, physicians should choose either thrombolysis or PCI as the primary treatment strategy for reperfusion. Rescue PCI or subsequent elective PCI may be performed after administration of thrombolytic therapies if medically appropriate; however, the optimal use of adjunctive antithrombotic and antiplatelet therapies in this setting is unknown\n【63】 # Adverse Reactions\n【64】 # Clinical Trials Experience\n【65】 # Adverse Reactions\n【66】 ## Bleeding\n【67】 - The most frequent adverse reaction associated with Tenecteplase is bleeding\n【68】 - Should serious bleeding occur, concomitant heparin and antiplatelet therapy should be discontinued. Death or permanent disability can occur in patients who experience stroke or serious bleeding episodes\n【69】 - For Tenecteplase-treated patients in ASSENT-2, the incidence of intracranial hemorrhage was 0.9% and any stroke was 1.8%. The incidence of all strokes, including intracranial bleeding, increases with increasing age\n【70】 - In the ASSENT-2 study, the following bleeding events were reported\n【71】 - Non-intracranial major bleeding and the need for blood transfusions were lower in patients treated with Tenecteplase\n【72】 - Types of major bleeding reported in 1% or more of the patients were hematoma (1.7%) and gastrointestinal tract (1%). Types of major bleeding reported in less than 1% of the patients were urinary tract, puncture site (including cardiac catheterization site), retroperitoneal, respiratory tract, and unspecified. Types of minor bleeding reported in 1% or more of the patients were hematoma (12.3%), urinary tract (3.7%), puncture site (including cardiac catheterization site) (3.6%), pharyngeal (3.1%), gastrointestinal tract (1.9%), epistaxis (1.5%), and unspecified (1.3%)\n【73】 ## Allergic Reactions\n【74】 - Allergic-type reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis, angioedema, laryngeal edema, rash, and urticaria) have rarely (< 1%) been reported in patients treated with Tenecteplase. Anaphylaxis was reported in < 0.1% of patients treated with Tenecteplase; however, causality was not established. When such reactions occur, they usually respond to conventional therapy\n【75】 # Other Adverse Reactions\n【76】 - The following adverse reactions have been reported among patients receiving Tenecteplase in clinical trials. These reactions are frequent sequelae of the underlying disease, and the effect of Tenecteplase on the incidence of these events is unknown\n【77】 - These events include cardiogenic shock, arrhythmias, atrioventricular block, pulmonary edema, heart failure, cardiac arrest, recurrent myocardial ischemia, myocardial reinfarction, myocardial rupture, cardiac tamponade, pericarditis, pericardial effusion, mitral regurgitation, thrombosis, embolism, and electromechanical dissociation. These events can be life-threatening and may lead to death. Nausea and/or vomiting,hypotension, and fever have also been reported\n【78】 ## Postmarketing Experience\n【79】 - There is limited information regarding Tenecteplase Postmarketing Experience in the drug label\n【80】 # Drug Interactions\n【81】 - Formal interaction studies of Tenecteplase with other drugs have not been performed. Patients studied in clinical trials of Tenecteplase were routinely treated with heparin and aspirin. Anticoagulants (such as heparin and vitamin K antagonists) and drugs that alter platelet function (such as acetylsalicylic acid, dipyridamole, and GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors) may increase the risk of bleeding if administered prior to, during, or after Tenecteplase therapy\n【82】 # Usein Specific Populations\n【83】 ### Pregnancy\n【84】 - Pregnancy Category (FDA): C\n【85】 - Tenecteplase has been shown to elicit maternal and embryo toxicity in rabbits given multiple IV administrations. In rabbits administered 0.5, 1.5, and 5.0 mg/kg/day, vaginal hemorrhageresulted in maternal deaths. Subsequent embryonic deaths were secondary to maternal hemorrhage and no fetal anomalies were observed. Tenecteplase does not elicit maternal and embryo toxicity in rabbits following a single IV administration. Thus, in developmental toxicity studies conducted in rabbits, the no observable effect level (NOEL) of a single IV administration of Tenecteplase on maternal or developmental toxicity was 5 mg/kg (approximately 8–10 times the human dose). There are no adequate and well‑controlled studies in pregnant women. Tenecteplase should be given to pregnant women only if the potential benefits justify the potential risk to the fetus\n【86】 - Pregnancy Category (AUS):\n【87】 - There is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Tenecteplase in women who are pregnant\n【88】 ### Labor and Delivery\n【89】 - There is no FDA guidance on use of Tenecteplase during labor and delivery\n【90】 ### Nursing Mothers\n【91】 - It is not known if Tenecteplase is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Tenecteplase is administered to a nursing woman\n【92】 ### Pediatric Use\n【93】 - The safety and effectiveness of Tenecteplase in pediatric patients have not been established\n【94】 ### Geriatic Use\n【95】 - Of the patients in ASSENT-2 who received Tenecteplase, 4,958 (59%) were under the age of 65; 2,256 (27%) were between the ages of 65 and 74; and 1,244 (15%) were 75 and over. The 30-day mortality rates by age were 2.5% in patients under the age of 65, 8.5% in patients between the ages of 65 and 74, and 16.2% in patients age 75 and over. The ICH rates were 0.4% in patients under the age of 65, 1.6% in patients between the ages of 65 and 74, and 1.7% in patients age 75 and over. The rates of any stroke were 1.0% in patients under the age of 65, 2.9% in patients between the ages of 65 and 74, and 3.0% in patients age 75 and over. Major bleeding rates, defined as bleeding requiring blood transfusion or leading to hemodynamic compromise, were 3.1% in patients under the age of 65, 6.4% in patients between the ages of 65 and 74, and 7.7% in patients age 75 and over. In elderly patients, the benefits of Tenecteplase on mortality should be carefully weighed against the risk of increased adverse events, including bleeding\n【96】 ### Gender\n【97】 - There is no FDA guidance on the use of Tenecteplase with respect to specific gender populations\n【98】 ### Race\n【99】 - There is no FDA guidance on the use of Tenecteplase with respect to specific racial populations\n【100】 ### Renal Impairment\n【101】 - There is no FDA guidance on the use of Tenecteplase in patients with renal impairment\n【102】 ### Hepatic Impairment\n【103】 - There is no FDA guidance on the use of Tenecteplase in patients with hepatic impairment\n【104】 # Femalesof Reproductive Potentialand Males\n【105】 - There is no FDA guidance on the use of Tenecteplase in women of reproductive potentials and males\n【106】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\n【107】 - There is no FDA guidance one the use of Tenecteplase in patients who are immunocompromised\n【108】 # Administration and Monitoring\n【109】 ### Administration\n【110】 1.The product should be visually inspected prior to administration for particulate matter and discoloration. Tenecteplase may be administered as reconstituted at 5 mg/mL\n【111】 2.Precipitation may occur when Tenecteplase is administered in an IV line containing dextrose. Dextrose-containing lines should be flushed with a saline-containing solution prior to and following single bolus administration of Tenecteplase\n【112】 3.Reconstituted Tenecteplase should be administered as a single IV bolus over 5 seconds\n【113】 4.Because Tenecteplase contains no antibacterial preservatives, it should be reconstituted immediately before use. If the reconstituted Tenecteplase is not used immediately, refrigerate the Tenecteplase vial at 2–8°C (36–46°F) and use within 8 hours\n【114】 5.Although the supplied syringe is compatible with a conventional needle, this syringe is designed to be used with needleless IV systems. From the information below, follow the instructions applicable to the IV system in use\n【115】 6.Dispose of the syringe, cannula and shield per established procedures\n【116】 - The safety and efficacy of Tenecteplase have only been investigated with concomitant administration of heparin and aspirin\n【117】 ### Reconstitution\n【118】 - NOTE: Read all instructions completely before beginning reconstitution and administration\n【119】 1.Remove the shield assembly from the supplied B-D 10 mL syringe with TwinPak Dual Cannula Device  and aseptically withdraw 10 mL of Sterile Water for Injection (SWFI), USP, from the supplied diluent vial using the red hub cannula syringe filling device. Do not use Bacteriostatic Water for Injection, USP\n【120】 - Note: Do not discard the shield assembly\n【121】 2.Inject the entire contents of the syringe (10 mL) into the Tenecteplase vial directing the diluent stream into the powder. Slight foaming upon reconstitution is not unusual; any large bubbles will dissipate if the product is allowed to stand undisturbed for several minutes\n【122】 3.Gently swirl until contents are completely dissolved. DO NOT SHAKE. The reconstituted preparation results in a colorless to pale yellow transparent solution containing Tenecteplase at 5 mg/mL at a pH of approximately 7.3. The osmolality of this solution is approximately 290 mOsm/kg\n【123】 4.Determine the appropriate dose of Tenecteplase  and withdraw this volume (in milliliters) from the reconstituted vial with the syringe. Any unused solution should be discarded\n【124】 5.Once the appropriate dose of Tenecteplase is drawn into the syringe, stand the shield vertically on a flat surface (with green side down) and passively recap the red hub cannula\n【125】 6.Remove the entire shield assembly, including the red hub cannula, by twisting counterclockwise. Note: The shield assembly also contains the clear-ended blunt plastic cannula; retain for split septum IV access\n【126】 ### Readministration\n【127】 - Readministration of plasminogen activators, including tenecteplase, to patients who have received prior plasminogen activator therapy has not been systematically studied. Three of 487 patients tested for antibody formation to tenecteplase had a positive antibody titer at 30 days. The data reflect the percentage of patients whose test results were considered positive for antibodies to tenecteplase in a radioimmunoprecipitation assay, and are highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including sample handling, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to tenecteplase with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading. Although sustained antibody formation in patients receiving one dose of tenecteplase has not been documented, readministration should be undertaken with caution. If an anaphylactic reaction occurs, appropriate therapy should be administered\n【128】 ### Monitoring\n【129】 - There is limited information regarding Monitoring of Tenecteplase in the drug label\n【130】 # IV Compatibility\n【131】 - There is limited information regarding the compatibility of Tenecteplase and IV administrations\n【132】 # Overdosage\n【133】 - There is limited information regarding Tenecteplase overdosage.  If you suspect drug poisoning or overdose, please contact the National Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) immediately\n【134】 # Pharmacology\n【135】 ## Mechanism of Action\n【136】 - Tenecteplase is a modified form of human tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) that binds to fibrin and converts plasminogen to plasmin. In the presence of fibrin, in vitro studies demonstrate that Tenecteplase conversion of plasminogen to plasmin is increased relative to its conversion in the absence of fibrin. This fibrin specificity decreases systemic activation of plasminogen and the resulting degradation of circulating fibrinogen as compared to a molecule lacking this property. Following administration of 30, 40, or 50 mg of Tenecteplase, there are decreases in circulating fibrinogen (4%–15%) and plasminogen (11%–24%). The clinical significance of fibrin-specificity on safety (e.g., bleeding) or efficacy has not been established. Biological potency is determined by an in vitro clot lysis assay and is expressed in Tenecteplase-specific units. The specific activity of Tenecteplase has been defined as 200 units/mg\n【137】 ## Structure\n【138】 - Tenecteplase is a tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) produced by recombinant DNA technology using an established mammalian cell line (Chinese Hamster Ovary cells). Tenecteplase is a 527 amino acid glycoprotein developed by introducing the following modifications to the complementary DNA (cDNA) for natural human tPA: a substitution of threonine 103 with asparagine, and a substitution of asparagine 117 with glutamine, both within the kringle 1 domain, and a tetra-alanine substitution at amino acids 296–299 in the protease domain\n【139】 ## Pharmacodynamics\n【140】 - In patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), Tenecteplase administered as a single bolus exhibits a biphasic disposition from the plasma. Tenecteplase was cleared from the plasma with an initial half-life of 20 to 24 minutes. The terminal phase half-life of Tenecteplase was 90 to 130 minutes. In 99 of 104 patients treated with Tenecteplase, mean plasma clearance ranged from 99 to 119 mL/min\n【141】 - The initial volume of distribution is weight related and approximates plasma volume. Liver metabolism is the major clearance mechanism for Tenecteplase\n【142】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n【143】 - There is limited information regarding Pharmacokinetics of Tenecteplase in the drug label\n【144】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\n【145】 - Studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential, mutagenicity, or the effect on fertility\n【146】 # Clinical Studies\n【147】 - ASSENT-2 was an international, randomized, double-blind trial that compared 30-day mortality rates in 16,949 patients assigned to receive an IV bolus dose of Tenecteplase or an accelerated infusion of Activase (alteplase). Eligibility criteria included onset of chest pain within 6 hours of randomization and ST-segment elevation or left bundle branch block on electrocardiogram (ECG). Patients were to be excluded from the trial if they received GP IIb/IIIainhibitors within the previous 12 hours. Tenecteplase was dosed using actual or estimated weight in a weight-tiered fashion. All patients were to receive 150–325 mg of aspirin administered as soon as possible, followed by 150–325 mg daily. Intravenous heparin was to be administered as soon as possible: for patients weighing ≤67 kg, heparin was administered as a 4000 unit IV bolus followed by infusion at 800 U/hr; for patients weighing >67 kg, heparin was administered as a 5000 unit IV bolus followed by infusion at 1000 U/hr. heparin was continued for 48 to 72 hours with infusion adjusted to maintain aPTT at 50–75 seconds. The use of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors was discouraged for the first 24 hours following randomization. The results of the primary endpoint (30-day mortality rates with non-parametric adjustment for the covariates of age, Killip class, heart rate, systolic blood pressure and infarct location) along with selected other 30-day endpoints are shown in\n【148】 - Rates of mortality and the combined endpoint of death or stroke among pre-specified subgroups, including age, gender, time to treatment, infarct location, and history of previousmyocardial infarction, demonstrate consistent relative risks across these subgroups. There was insufficient enrollment of non-Caucasian patients to draw any conclusions regarding relative efficacy in racial subsets\n【149】 - Rates of in-hospital procedures, including percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), stent placement, intra-aortic balloon pump(IABP) use, and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, were similar between the Tenecteplase and Activase(Alteplase) groups\n【150】 - TIMI 10B was an open-label, controlled, randomized, dose-ranging, angiography study which utilized a blinded core laboratory for review of coronary arteriograms.  Patients (n = 837) presenting within 12 hours of symptom onset were treated with fixed doses of 30, 40, or 50 mg of Tenecteplase or the accelerated infusion of activase and underwent coronary arteriography at 90 minutes. The results showed that the 40 mg and 50 mg doses were similar to accelerated infusion of activase in restoring patency. TIMI Grade 3 flow and TIMI Grade 2/3 flow at 90 minutes are shown in  The exact relationship between coronary artery patency and clinical activity has not been established\n【151】 - The angiographic results from TIMI 10B and the safety data from ASSENT-1, an additional uncontrolled safety study of 3,235 Tenecteplase-treated patients, provided the framework to develop a weight-tiered Tenecteplase dose regimen.3 Exploratory analyses suggested that a weight-adjusted dose of 0.5 mg/kg to 0.6 mg/kg of Tenecteplase resulted in a better patency to bleeding relationship than fixed doses of Tenecteplase across a broad range of patient weights\n【152】 - The Assessment of the Safety and Efficacy of a New Treatment Strategy with Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (ASSENT 4 PCI) was a Phase IIIb/IV study designed to assess the safety and effectiveness of a strategy of administering full dose Tenecteplase with a single bolus of 4000 U of unfractionated heparin in patients with ST segment elevation AMI, in whom primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was planned, but in whom a delay of 1–3 hours was anticipated before PCI. The trial was prematurely terminated with 1667 randomized patients (75 of whom were treated in the United States) due to a numerically higher mortality in the patients receiving Tenecteplase prior to primary PCI versus PCI without Tenecteplase (median time from randomization to balloon of 115 minutes). The incidence of the 90‑day primary endpoint, a composite of death or cardiogenic shock or congestive heart failure (CHF) within 90 days, was 18.6% in patients treated with Tenecteplase plus PCI versus 13.4% in those treated with PCI alone (p=0.0055;  1.39 (95% C.I. 1.11–1.74))\n【153】 - There were trends toward worse outcomes in the individual components of the primary endpoint between Tenecteplase plus PCI versus PCI alone (mortality 6.7% vs. 5.0%, respectively; cardiogenic shock 6.1% vs. 4.8%, respectively; and CHF 12.1% vs. 9.4%, respectively). In addition, there were trends towards worse outcomes in recurrent MI (6.1% vs. 3.5%, respectively; p=0.03) and repeat target vessel revascularization (6.6% vs. 3.6%, respectively; p=0.005) in patients receiving Tenecteplase plus PCI versus PCI alone\n【154】 - There was no difference in in‑hospital major bleeding between the two groups (5.6% vs. 4.4% for Tenecteplase plus PCI vs. PCI alone, respectively). For patients treated with Tenecteplase plus PCI, in‑hospital rates of intracranial hemorrhage and total stroke were similar to those observed in previous trials (0.97% and 1.8%, respectively); however, none of the patients treated with PCI alone experienced a stroke (ischemic, hemorrhagic or other)\n【155】 # How Supplied\n【156】 - Tenecteplase is supplied as a sterile, lyophilized powder in a 50 mg vial under partial vacuum. Each 50 mg vial of Tenecteplase is packaged with one 10 mL vial of Sterile Water for Injection, USP for reconstitution, the B-D 10 mL syringe with TwinPak Dual Cannula Device, and three alcohol prep pads.

Since 1999, no OPV has been distributed in the United States. Under these ACIP recommendations, the routine IPV vaccination schedule in the United States consists of 4 doses administered at ages 2 months, 4 months, 6--18 months, and 4--6 years with the minimum interval between all IPV doses as 4 weeks .#\n【1】 - Since the ACIP recommendation was made 10 years ago, three different combination vaccines containing IPV have been licensed for routine use in the United States . Because of potential confusion in using different vaccine products for routine and catch-up immunization, ACIP recommends the following:\n【2】 - The 4-dose IPV series should continue to be administered at ages 2 months, 4 months, 6--18 months, and 4--6 years\n【3】 - The final dose in the IPV series should be administered at age ≥4 years regardless of the number of previous doses\n【4】 - The minimum interval from dose 3 to dose 4 is extended from 4 weeks to 6 months\n【5】 - The minimum interval from dose 1 to dose 2, and from dose 2 to dose 3, remains 4 weeks\n【6】 - The minimum age for dose 1 remains age 6 weeks\n【7】 - ACIP also is making a new recommendation concerning the use of minimum age and minimum intervals for children in the first 6 months of life. Use of the minimum age and minimum intervals for vaccine administration in the first 6 months of life are recommended only if the vaccine recipient is at risk for imminent exposure to circulating poliovirus (e.g., during an outbreak or because of travel to a polio-endemic region). ACIP is making this precaution because shorter intervals and earlier start dates lead to lower seroconversion rates (3--5)\n【8】 - In addition, ACIP is clarifying the poliovirus vaccination schedule to be used for specific combination vaccines. When DTaP-IPV/Hib- (Pentacel) is used to provide 4 doses at ages 2, 4, 6, and 15--18 months, an additional booster dose of age-appropriate IPV-containing vaccine (IPV  or DTaP-IPV  ) should be administered at age 4--6 years. This will result in a 5-dose IPV vaccine series, which is considered accepby ACIP. DTaP-IPV/Hib is not indicated for the booster dose at age 4--6 years. ACIP recommends that the minimum interval from dose 4 to dose 5 should be at least 6 months to provide an optimum booster response. In accordance with existing recommendations, if a child misses an IPV dose at age 4--6 years, the child should receive a booster dose as soon as feasible\n【9】 Diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis adsorbed, and inactivated poliovirus vaccine", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-15 17:51:29", "update_time": "2024-04-15 21:58:17"}

Strictly speaking, geo-thermal necessarily refers to the Earth but the concept may be applied to other planets\n【3】 - Geothermal is technically an adjective (e.g., geothermal energy) but in U.S. English the word has attained frequent use as a noun (otherwise expressed as g. heat, g. source, or geotherm)\n【4】 - The planet's internal heat was originally generated during its accretion, due to gravitational binding energy, and since then additional heat has continued to be generated by the radioactive decay of elements such as uranium, thorium, and potassium. The heat flow from the interior to the surface is only 1/20,000 as great as the energy received from the Sun\n【5】 - Temperature within the Earth increases with increasing depth. Highly viscous or partially molten rock at temperatures between 1,200 and 2,200 °F (650 to 1,200 °C) is postulated to exist everywhere beneath the Earth's surface at depths of 50 to 60 miles (80 to 100 kilometers), and the temperature at the Earth's center, nearly 4,000 miles  deep, is estimated to be 5650 ± 600 kelvins\n【6】 - Much of the heat is believed to be created by decay of naturally radioactive elements. An estimated 45 to 90 percent of the heat escaping from the Earth originates from radioactive decay of elements within the mantle\n【7】 - Heat of impact and compression released during the original formation of the Earth by accretion of in-falling meteorites\n【8】 - Heat released from the sinking of abundant heavy metals (iron, nickel, copper) as they descended to the Earth's core\n【9】 - Some heat may be created by electromagnetic effects of the magnetic fields involved in Earth's magnetic field\n【10】 - Heat generated within the Earth's core may be in the range of 4–10 TW\n【11】 - Heat may be generated by tidal force on the Earth as it rotates, since land cannot flow like water it compresses and distorts, generating heat\n【12】 # Heat flow\n【13】 - Heat flows constantly from its sources within the Earth to the surface\n【14】 - Global terrestrial heat flow is about 45 TW (1 TW = 1012 watts)\n【15】 # Hot spots\n【16】 - Geothermal heat at the surface is highly concentrated where magma is close to the surface.

Diflorasone is in a class of medications called topical steroids. It works by reducing inflammation and itching\n【3】 # How this medication should be used\n【4】 - Diflorasone comes as a cream and an ointment to apply to the skin. It is usually applied to the affected area one to three times a day. To help you remember to use diflorasone, apply it around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use diflorasone exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor\n【5】 - Wash or soak the affected area thoroughly before applying the medicine, unless it irritates your skin. Then apply the ointment or cream sparingly in a thin film and rub it in gently\n【6】 - If you are using diflorasone on your face, keep it out of your eyes\n【7】 - If you are using diflorasone on a child's diaper area, do not use tight-fitting diapers or plastic pants. Such use may increase side effects\n【8】 - Do not apply cosmetics or other skin preparations on the treated area without talking with your doctor\n【9】 - Do not wrap or bandage the treated area unless your doctor tells you to. If your doctor tells you to wrap or bandage the treated area, follow these instructions:\n【10】 - Soak the area in water or wash it well\n【11】 - While the skin is moist, gently rub the medication into the affected areas\n【12】 - Cover the area with plastic wrap (such as Saran Wrap or Handi-Wrap). The plastic may be held in place with a gauze or elastic bandage or adhesive tape on the normal skin beside the treated area. (Instead of using plastic wrap, plastic gloves may be used for the hands, plastic bags for the feet, or a shower cap for the scalp.)\n【13】 - Carefully seal the edges of the plastic to make sure the wrap adheres closely to the skin. If the affected area is moist, you can leave the edges of the plastic wrap partly unsealed or puncture the wrap to allow excess moisture to escape\n【14】 - Leave the plastic wrapping in place as long as instructed by your doctor. Usually plastic wraps are left in place not more than 12 hours each day\n【15】 - Cleanse the skin and reapply the medication each time a new plastic wrapping is applied\n【16】 # Other uses for this medicine\n【17】 - This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information\n【18】 # Special precautions\n【19】 - Before using diflorasone:\n【20】 - tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to diflorasone or any other medications\n【21】 - tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking\n【22】 - tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while using diflorasone, call your doctor\n【23】 # Special dietary instructions\n【24】 - Unless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet\n【25】 # What to do if you forget a dose\n【26】 - Apply the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not apply a double dose to make up for a missed one\n【27】 # Side effects\n【28】 - Diflorasone may cause side effects. If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately:\n【29】 - skin burning, itching, or irritation\n【30】 - dry skin\n【31】 - rash\n【32】 - increased hair growth\n【33】 - skin discoloration\n【34】 - Long-term use of diflorasone may cause children to grow more slowly. Talk to your doctor about the risks of using this medication\n【35】 - Diflorasone may cause other side effects. Call your doctor if you have any unusual problems while using this medication\n【36】 - If you experience a serious side effect, you or your doctor may send a report to the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program online  or by phone\n【37】 # Storage conditions needed for this medication\n【38】 - Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Throw away any medication that is outdated or no longer needed. Talk to your pharmacist about the proper disposal of your medication\n【39】 # Other information\n【40】 - Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor may order certain lab tests to check your body's response to diflorasone\n【41】 - Do not let anyone else use your medication. Do not use this medication for a skin condition other than the one for which it was prescribed.

It aims to reduce bedwetting and the distress this causes by explaining what to ask in an assessment, what advice to provide, and which treatments are effective\n【2】 # Introduction\n【3】 - Bedwetting is a widespread and distressing condition that can have a deep impact on a child or young person's behaviour, emotional wellbeing and social life. It is also very stressful for the parents or carers. The prevalence of bedwetting decreases with age. Bedwetting less than 2 nights a week has a prevalence of 21% at about 4 and a half years and 8% at 9 and a half years. More frequent bedwetting is less common and has a prevalence of 8% at 4 and a half years and 1.5% at 9 and a half years\n【4】 - The causes of bedwetting are not fully understood. Bedwetting can be considered to be a symptom that may result from a combination of different predisposing factors. There are a number of different disturbances of physiology that may be associated with bedwetting. These disturbances may be categorised as sleep arousal difficulties, polyuria and bladder dysfunction. Bedwetting also often runs in families\n【5】 - Experts and expert bodies differ in their definitions of 'nocturnal enuresis' . The term 'bedwetting' is used in this guideline to describe the symptom of involuntary wetting during sleep without any inherent suggestion of frequency of bedwetting or pathophysiology\n【6】 - This guideline makes recommendations on the assessment and management of bedwetting in children and young people. The guidance applies to children and young people up to 19 years with the symptom of bedwetting. Children are generally expected to be dry by a developmental age of 5 years, and historically it has been common practice to consider children for treatment only when they reach 7 years. The guideline scope did not specify a minimum age limit to allow consideration of whether there are interventions of benefit to younger children previously excluded from advice and services due to their age. We have included specific advice for children under 5 years, and indicated treatment options for children between 5 and 7 years\n【7】 - Children and young people with bedwetting may also have symptoms related to the urinary tract during the day. A history of daytime urinary symptoms may be important in determining the approach to management of bedwetting and so the assessment sections include questions about daytime urinary symptoms and how the answers to these may influence the approach to managing bedwetting. However, the management of daytime urinary symptoms is outside the scope of this guideline\n【8】 - The treatment of bedwetting has a positive effect on the self‑esteem of children and young people. Healthcare professionals should persist in offering different treatments and treatment combinations if the first‑choice treatment is not successful. Children and young people with bedwetting are cared for by a number of different healthcare professionals in a variety of settings. All healthcare professionals should be aware of and work within legal and professional codes and competency frameworks\n【9】 - The guideline will assume that prescribers will use a drug's summary of product characteristics to inform decisions made with individual patients\n【10】 - Butler RJ, Heron J  The prevalence of infrequent bedwetting and nocturnal enuresis in childhood: A large British cohort. Scandinavian Journal of Urology and Nephrology 42: 257–64# Patient‑centred care\n【11】 - This guideline offers best practice advice on the care of children and young people with bedwetting\n【12】 - Treatment and care should take into account patients' needs and preferences. Children and young people with bedwetting and their parents and/or carers should have the opportunity to make informed decisions about their care and treatment, in partnership with their healthcare professionals. If a child or young person is not old enough or does not have the capacity to make decisions, healthcare professionals should follow the Department of Health's advice on consent and the code of practice that accompanies the Mental Capacity Act. In Wales, healthcare professionals should follow advice on consent from the Welsh Government\n【13】 - Good communication between healthcare professionals and patients is essential. It should be supported by evidence‑based written information tailored to the patient's needs. Treatment and care, and the information patients are given about it, should be culturally appropriate. It should also be accessible to people with additional needs such as physical, sensory or learning disabilities, and to people who do not speak or read English\n【14】 - Families and carers should have the opportunity to be involved in decisions about treatment and care. Where appropriate, for example for older children, this should be with the child's agreement\n【15】 - Families and carers should also be given the information and support they need\n【16】 - Care of young people in transition between paediatric and adult services should be planned and managed according to the best practice guidance described in Transition: getting it right for young people\n【17】 - Adult and paediatric healthcare teams should work jointly to provide assessment and services to young people with bedwetting. Diagnosis and management should be reviewed throughout the transition process, and there should be clarity about who is the lead clinician to ensure continuity of care.# Guidance\n used to develop the guidance\n【19】 - These recommendations apply to all healthcare professionals who are involved in the management of bedwetting in children and young people. Healthcare professionals are reminded of their duty under the Disability Discrimination Act  to make reasonable adjustments to ensure that all people have the same opportunity for health\n【20】 - For the purposes of this guideline we have used the terms 'bedwetting' and 'daytime symptoms' to describe those symptoms that may be experienced by the population who present for treatment of 'bedwetting'\n【21】 - The following definitions were used for this guideline:\n【22】 - Bedwetting: involuntary wetting during sleep without any inherent suggestion of frequency of bedwetting or pathophysiology\n【23】 - Daytime symptoms: daytime urinary symptoms such as wetting, urinary frequency or urgency\n【24】 - Response to an intervention: the child has achieved 14 consecutive dry nights or a 90% improvement in the number of wet nights per week\n【25】 - Partial response: the child's bedwetting has improved but 14 consecutive dry nights or a 90% improvement in the number of wet nights per week has not been achieved\n【26】 # Principles of care\n【27】 - Inform children and young people with bedwetting and their parents or carers that bedwetting is not the child or young person's fault and that punitive measures should not be used in the management of bedwetting\n【28】 - Offer support, assessment and treatment tailored to the circumstances and needs of the child or young person and parents or carers\n【29】 - Do not exclude younger children (for example, those under 7 years) from the management of bedwetting on the basis of age alone\n【30】 - Perform regular medication reviews for children and young people on repeated courses of drug treatment for bedwetting\n【31】 # Information for the child or young person and family\n【32】 - Offer information tailored to the needs of children and young people being treated for bedwetting and their parents and carers\n【33】 - Offer information and details of support groups to children and young people being treated for bedwetting and their parents or carers\n【34】 - Offer information about practical ways to reduce the impact of bedwetting before and during treatment (for example, using bed protection and washable and disposable products)\n【35】 # Assessment and investigation\n【36】 - Ask whether the bedwetting started in the last few days or weeks. If so, consider whether this is a presentation of a systemic illness\n【37】 - Ask if the child or young person had previously been dry at night without assistance for 6 months. If so, enquire about any possible medical, emotional or physical triggers, and consider whether assessment and treatment is needed for any identified triggers\n【38】 - Ask about the pattern of bedwetting, including questions such as:\n【39】 - How many nights a week does bedwetting occur?\n【40】 - How many times a night does bedwetting occur?\n【41】 - Does there seem to be a large amount of urine?\n【42】 - At what times of night does the bedwetting occur?\n【43】 - Does the child or young person wake up after bedwetting?\n【44】 - Ask about the presence of daytime symptoms in a child or young person with bedwetting, including:\n【45】 - daytime frequency (that is, passing urine more than seven times a day)\n【46】 - daytime urgency\n【47】 - daytime wetting\n【48】 - passing urine infrequently (fewer than four times a day)\n【49】 - abdominal straining or poor urinary stream\n【50】 - pain passing urine\n【51】 - Ask about daytime toileting patterns in a child or young person with bedwetting, including:\n【52】 - whether daytime symptoms occur only in some situations\n【53】 - avoidance of toilets at school or other settings\n【54】 - whether the child or young person goes to the toilet more or less frequently than his or her peers\n【55】 - Ask about the child or young person's fluid intake throughout the day. In particular, ask whether the child or young person, or the parents or carers are restricting fluids\n【56】 - Consider whether a record of the child or young person's fluid intake, daytime symptoms, bedwetting and toileting patterns would be useful in the assessment and management of bedwetting. If so, consider asking the child or young person and parents or carers to record this information\n【57】 - Do not perform urinalysis routinely in children and young people with bedwetting, unless any of the following apply:\n【58】 - bedwetting started in the last few days or weeks\n【59】 - there are daytime symptoms\n【60】 - there are any signs of ill health\n【61】 - there is a history, symptoms or signs suggestive of urinary tract infection\n【62】 - there is a history, symptoms or signs suggestive of diabetes mellitus\n【63】 - Assess whether the child or young person has any comorbidities or there are other factors to consider, in particular:\n【64】 - constipation and/or soiling\n【65】 - developmental, attention or learning difficulties\n【66】 - diabetes mellitus\n【67】 - behavioural or emotional problems\n【68】 - family problems or a vulnerable child or young person or family\n【69】 - Consider assessment, investigation and/or referral when bedwetting is associated with:\n【70】 - severe daytime symptoms\n【71】 - a history of recurrent urinary infections\n【72】 - known or suspected physical or neurological problems\n【73】 - comorbidities or other factors (for example, those listed in recommendation 1.3.9)\n【74】 - Investigate and treat children and young people with suspected urinary tract infection in line with urinary tract infection (NICE guideline CG54)\n【75】 - Investigate and treat children and young people with soiling or constipation in line with constipation in children and young people (NICE guideline CG99)\n【76】 - Refer children and young people with suspected type 1 diabetes immediately (on the same day) to a multidisciplinary paediatric diabetes team with the competencies needed to confirm diagnosis and to provide immediate care\n【77】 - Consider investigating and treating daytime symptoms before bedwetting if daytime symptoms predominate\n【78】 - Consider involving a professional with psychological expertise for children and young people with bedwetting and emotional or behavioural problems\n【79】 - Discuss factors that might affect treatment and support needs, such as:\n【80】 - sleeping arrangements (for example, does the child or young person have his or her own bed or bedroom)\n【81】 - the impact of bedwetting on the child or young person and family\n【82】 - whether the child or young person and parents or carers have the necessary level of commitment, including time available, to engage in a treatment programme\n【83】 - Discuss with the parents or carers whether they need support, particularly if they are having difficulty coping with the burden of bedwetting, or if they are expressing anger, negativity or blame towards the child or young person\n【84】 - Consider maltreatment if:\n【85】 - a child or young person is reported to be deliberately bedwetting\n【86】 - parents or carers are seen or reported to punish a child or young person for bedwetting despite professional advice that the symptom is involuntary\n【87】 - a child or young person has secondary daytime wetting or secondary bedwetting that persists despite adequate assessment and management unless there is a medical explanation (for example, urinary tract infection) or clearly identified stressful situation that is not part of maltreatment (for example, bereavement, parental separation)\n【88】 - Use the findings of the history to inform the diagnosis ,according to  and management of bedwetting\n【89】 -  Findings from the history and their possible interpretation\n【90】 - Findings from history\n【91】 - Possible interpretation\n【92】 - Large volume of urine in the first few hours of night\n【93】 - Typical pattern for bedwetting only\n【94】 - Variable volume of urine, often more than once a night\n【95】 - Typical pattern for children and young people who have bedwetting and daytime symptoms with possible underlying overactive bladder\n【96】 - Bedwetting every night\n【97】 - Severe bedwetting, which is less likely to resolve spontaneously than infrequent bedwetting\n【98】 - Previously dry for more than 6 months\n【99】 - Bedwetting is defined as secondary\n【100】 - Daytime frequency\n【101】 - Daytime urgency\n【102】 - Daytime wetting\n【103】 - Abdominal straining or poor urinary stream\n【104】 - Pain passing urine\n【105】 - Any of these may indicate the presence of a bladder disorder such as overactive bladder or more rarely (when symptoms are very severe and persistent) an underlying urological disease\n【106】 - Constipation\n【107】 - A common comorbidity that can cause bedwetting and requires treatment\n【108】 - Soiling\n【109】 - Frequent soiling is usually secondary to underlying faecal impaction and constipation which may have been unrecognised\n【110】 - Inadequate fluid intake\n【111】 - May mask an underlying bladder problem, such as overactive bladder disorder, and may impede the development of an adequate bladder capacity\n【112】 - Behavioural and emotional problems\n【113】 - These may be a cause or a consequence of bedwetting. Treatment may need to be tailored to the specific requirements of each child or young person and family\n【114】 - Family problems\n【115】 - A difficult or 'stressful' environment may be a trigger for bedwetting. These factors should be addressed alongside the management of bedwetting\n【116】 - Practical issues\n【117】 - Easy access to a toilet at night, sharing a bedroom or bed and proximity of parents to provide support are all important issues to consider and address when considering treatment, especially with an alarm\n【118】 # Planning management\n【119】 - Explain the condition, the effect and aims of treatment, and the advantages and disadvantages of the possible treatments to the child or young person and parents or carers\n【120】 - Clarify what the child or young person and parents or carers hope the treatment will achieve. Ask whether short‑term dryness is a priority for family or recreational reasons (for example, for a sleep‑over)\n【121】 - Explore the child or young person's views about their bedwetting, including:\n【122】 - what they think the main problem is\n【123】 - whether they think the problem needs treatment\n【124】 - Explore and assess the ability of the family to cope with using an alarm for the treatment of bedwetting\n【125】 - Consider whether or not it is appropriate to offer alarm or drug treatment, depending on the age of the child or young person, the frequency of bedwetting and the motivation and needs of the child or young person and their family\n【126】 # Advice on fluid intake, diet and toileting patterns\n【127】 - Advise children and young people with bedwetting and their parents or carers that:\n【128】 - adequate daily fluid intake is important in the management of bedwetting\n【129】 - daily fluid intake varies according to ambient temperature, dietary intake and physical activity. A suggested intake of drinks is given in :\n【130】 -  Suggested daily intake of drinks for children and young people\n【131】 - Age\n【132】 - Sex\n【133】 - Total drinks per day\n【134】 –8 years\n【135】 - Female\n【136】 - Male\n【137】 –1400 ml\n【138】 –13 years\n【139】 –2100 ml\n【140】 –2300 ml\n【141】 –18 years\n【142】 –2500 ml\n【143】 –3200 ml\n【144】 - Advise the child or young person and parents or carers that the consumption of caffeine‑based drinks should be avoided in children and young people with bedwetting\n【145】 - Advise the child or young person and parents or carers to eat a healthy diet and not to restrict diet as a form of treatment for bedwetting\n【146】 - Advise the child or young person of the importance of using the toilet at regular intervals throughout the day\n【147】 - Advise parents or carers to encourage the child or young person to use the toilet to pass urine at regular intervals during the day and before sleep (typically between four and seven times in total). This should be continued alongside the chosen treatment for bedwetting\n【148】 - Address excessive or insufficient fluid intake or abnormal toileting patterns before starting other treatment for bedwetting in children and young people\n【149】 - Suggest a trial without nappies or pull‑ups for a child or young person with bedwetting who is toilet trained by day and is wearing nappies or pull‑ups at night. Offer advice on alternative bed protection to parents and carers\n【150】 # Lifting and waking\n【151】 - Offer advice on waking and lifting during the night as follows:\n【152】 - Neither waking nor lifting children and young people with bedwetting, at regular times or randomly, will promote long‑term dryness\n【153】 - Waking of children and young people by parents or carers, either at regular times or randomly, should be used only as a practical measure in the short‑term management of bedwetting\n【154】 - Young people with bedwetting that has not responded to treatment may find self‑instigated waking (for example, using a mobile phone alarm or alarm clock) a useful management strategy\n【155】 # Reward systems\n【156】 - Explain that reward systems with positive rewards for agreed behaviour rather than dry nights should be used either alone or in conjunction with other treatments for bedwetting. For example, rewards may be given for:\n【157】 - drinking recommended levels of fluid during the day\n【158】 - using the toilet to pass urine before sleep\n【159】 - engaging in management (for example, taking medication or helping to change sheets)\n【160】 - Inform parents or carers that they should not use systems that penalise or remove previously gained rewards\n【161】 - Advise parents or carers to try a reward system alone (as described in recommendation 1.7.1) for the initial treatment of bedwetting in young children who have some dry nights\n【162】 # Initial treatment – alarms\n【163】 - Offer an alarm as the first‑line treatment to children and young people whose bedwetting has not responded to advice on fluids, toileting or an appropriate reward system, unless:\n【164】 - an alarm is considered undesirable to the child or young person or their parents or carers or\n【165】 - an alarm is considered inappropriate, particularly if:\n【166】 - bedwetting is very infrequent (that is, less than 1–2 wet beds per week)\n【167】 - the parents or carers are having emotional difficulty coping with the burden of bedwetting\n【168】 - the parents or carers are expressing anger, negativity or blame towards the child or young person\n【169】 - Assess the response to an alarm by 4 weeks and continue with treatment if the child or young person is showing early signs of response. Stop treatment only if there are no early signs of response\n【170】 - Continue alarm treatment in children and young people with bedwetting who are showing signs of response until a minimum of 2 weeks' uninterrupted dry nights has been achieved\n【171】 - Assess whether it is appropriate to continue with alarm treatment if complete dryness is not achieved after 3 months. Only continue with alarm treatment if the bedwetting is still improving and the child or young person and parents or carers are motivated to continue\n【172】 - Do not exclude alarm treatment as an option for bedwetting in children and young people with:\n【173】 - daytime symptoms as well as bedwetting\n【174】 - secondary bedwetting\n【175】 - Consider an alternative type of alarm (for example, a vibrating alarm) for the treatment of bedwetting in children and young people who have a hearing impairment\n【176】 - Consider an alarm for the treatment of bedwetting in children and young people with learning difficulties and/or physical disabilities. Tailor the type of alarm to each individual's needs and abilities\n【177】 - Consider an alarm for the treatment of bedwetting in children under 7 years, depending on their ability, maturity, motivation and understanding of the alarm\n【178】 ## Using an alarm\n【179】 - Inform children and young people and parents or carers about the benefits of alarms combined with reward systems. Advise on the use of positive rewards for desired behaviour, such as waking up when the alarm goes off, going to the toilet after the alarm has gone off, returning to bed and resetting the alarm\n【180】 - Encourage children and young people with bedwetting and their parents or carers to discuss and agree on their roles and responsibilities for using the alarm and the use of rewards\n【181】 - Ensure that advice and support are available to children and young people and their parents or carers who are given an alarm, and agree how these should be obtained. Be aware that they may need a considerable amount of help in learning how to use an alarm\n【182】 - Inform the child or young person and their parents or carers that the aims of alarm treatment for bedwetting are to train the child or young person to:\n【183】 - recognise the need to pass urine\n【184】 - wake to go to the toilet or hold on\n【185】 - learn over time to hold on or to wake spontaneously and stop wetting the bed\n【186】 - Inform the child or young person and their parents or carers that:\n【187】 - alarms have a high long‑term success rate\n【188】 - using an alarm can disrupt sleep\n【189】 - that parents or carers may need to help the child or young person to wake to the alarm\n【190】 - using an alarm requires sustained commitment, involvement and effort from the child or young person and their parents or carers\n【191】 - they will need to record their progress (for example, if and when the child or young person wakes and how wet they and the bed are)\n【192】 - alarms are not suifor all children and young people and their families\n【193】 - If offering an alarm for bedwetting, inform the child and young person and their parents or carers how to:\n【194】 - set and use the alarm\n【195】 - respond to the alarm when it goes off\n【196】 - maintain the alarm\n【197】 - deal with problems with the alarm, including who to contact when there is a problem\n【198】 - return the alarm when they no longer need it\n【199】 - Inform the child and young person and their parents or carers that it may take a few weeks for the early signs of a response to the alarm to occur and that these may include:\n【200】 - smaller wet patches\n【201】 - waking to the alarm\n【202】 - the alarm going off later and fewer times per night\n【203】 - fewer wet nights\n【204】 - Inform the child or young person and their parents or carers that dry nights may be a late sign of response to the alarm and may take weeks to achieve\n【205】 - Inform the parents or carers that they can restart using the alarm immediately, without consulting a healthcare professional, if the child or young person starts bedwetting again following a response to alarm treatment\n【206】 # Lack of response to alarm treatment\n【207】 - If bedwetting does not respond to initial alarm treatment, offer:\n【208】 - combination treatment with an alarm and desmopressin or\n【209】 - desmopressin alone if continued use of an alarm is no longer accepto the child or young person or their parents and carers\n【210】 - Offer desmopressin alone to children and young people with bedwetting if there has been a partial response to a combination of an alarm and desmopressin following initial treatment with an alarm\n【211】 # Initial treatment – desmopressin\n【212】 - Offer desmopressin to children and young people over 7 years, if:\n【213】 - rapid‑onset and/or short‑term improvement in bedwetting is the priority of treatment or\n【214】 - an alarm is inappropriate or undesirable\n【215】 - Consider desmopressin for children aged 5–7 years if treatment is required and:\n【216】 - Do not exclude desmopressin as an option for the management of bedwetting in children and young people who also have daytime symptoms. However, do not use desmopressin in the treatment of children and young people who only have daytime wetting\n【217】 - In children and young people who are not completely dry after 1 to 2 weeks of the initial dose of desmopressin (200 micrograms for Desmotabs or 120 micrograms for DesmoMelt), consider increasing the dose (to 400 micrograms for Desmotabs or 240 micrograms for DesmoMelt)\n【218】 - Assess the response to desmopressin at 4 weeks and continue treatment for 3 months if there are signs of a response. Consider stopping if there are no signs of response. Signs of response include:\n【219】 - smaller wet patches\n【220】 - fewer wetting episodes per night\n【221】 - fewer wet nights\n【222】 - Do not exclude desmopressin as an option for the treatment of bedwetting in children and young people with sickle cell disease if an alarm is inappropriate or undesirable and they can comply with night‑time fluid restriction. Provide advice about withdrawal of desmopressin at times of sickle cell crisis\n【223】 - Do not exclude desmopressin as an option for the treatment of bedwetting in children and young people with emotional, attention or behavioural problems or developmental and learning difficulties if an alarm is inappropriate or undesirable and they can comply with night‑time fluid restriction\n【224】 - Do not routinely measure weight, serum electrolytes, blood pressure and urine osmolality in children and young people being treated with desmopressin for bedwetting\n【225】 - If offering desmopressin for bedwetting, inform the child or young person and their parents or carers:\n【226】 - that many children and young people, but not all, will experience a reduction in wetness\n【227】 - that many children and young people, but not all, will relapse when treatment is withdrawn\n【228】 - how desmopressin works\n【229】 - f the importance of fluid restriction from 1 hour before until 8 hours after taking desmopressin\n【230】 - that it should be taken at bedtime\n【231】 - if appropriate, how to increase the dose if there is an inadequate response to the starting dose\n【232】 - to continue treatment with desmopressin for 3 months\n【233】 - that repeated courses of desmopressin can be used\n【234】 - Consider advising that desmopressin should be taken 1–2 hours before bedtime in children and young people with bedwetting that has either partially responded or not responded to desmopressin taken at bedtime. Ensure that the child or young person can comply with fluid restriction starting from 1 hour before the drug is taken\n【235】 - Consider continuing treatment with desmopressin for children and young people with bedwetting that has partially responded, as bedwetting may improve for up to 6 months after starting treatment\n【236】 # Children and young people experiencing recurrence of bedwetting\n【237】 - Consider alarm treatment again if a child or young person who was previously dry with an alarm has started regularly bedwetting again\n【238】 - Offer combination treatment with an alarm and desmopressin to children and young people who have more than one recurrence of bedwetting following successful treatment with an alarm\n【239】 - Consider using repeated courses of desmopressin for children and young people with bedwetting that has responded to desmopressin treatment but who experience repeated recurrences. Withdraw desmopressin treatment at regular intervals (for 1 week every 3 months) to check if dryness has been achieved when using it for the long‑term treatment of bedwetting\n【240】 - Gradually withdraw desmopressin rather than suddenly stopping it if a child or young person has had a recurrence of bedwetting following response to previous desmopressin treatment courses\n【241】 - Consider alarm treatment as an alternative to continuing drug treatment for children and young people who have recurrences of bedwetting, if an alarm is now considered appropriate and desirable\n【242】 # Lack of response to initial treatment options\n【243】 - Refer children and young people with bedwetting that has not responded to courses of treatment with an alarm and/or desmopressin for further review and assessment of factors that may be associated with a poor response, such as an overactive bladder, an underlying disease or social and emotional factors\n【244】 # Anticholinergics\n【245】 - The use of anticholinergics for bedwetting in children and young people is discussed in the recommendations in this section. Not all anticholinergics have a UK marketing authorisation for treating bedwetting in children and young people. If a drug without a marketing authorisation for this indication is prescribed, informed consent should be obtained and documented\n【246】 - Do not use an anticholinergic alone for the management of bedwetting in children and young people without daytime symptoms\n【247】 - Consider an anticholinergic combined with desmopressin for bedwetting in children and young people who also have daytime symptoms and have been assessed by a healthcare professional with expertise in prescribing the combination of an anticholinergic and desmopressin\n【248】 - Consider an anticholinergic combined with desmopressin for children and young people who have been assessed by a healthcare professional with expertise in the management of bedwetting that has not responded to an alarm and/or desmopressin and have any of the following:\n【249】 - bedwetting that has partially responded to desmopressin alone\n【250】 - bedwetting that has not responded to desmopressin alone\n【251】 - bedwetting that has not responded to a combination of alarm and desmopressin\n【252】 - Consider continuing treatment for children and young people with bedwetting that has partially responded to desmopressin combined with an anticholinergic, as bedwetting may continue to improve for up to 6 months after starting treatment\n【253】 - Consider using repeated courses of desmopressin combined with an anticholinergic in children and young people who have responded to this combination but experience repeated recurrences of bedwetting following previous response to treatment\n【254】 - If offering an anticholinergic combined with desmopressin for bedwetting, inform the child or young person and their parents or carers:\n【255】 - that success rates are difficult to predict, but more children and young people are drier with this combination than with desmopressin alone\n【256】 - that desmopressin and an anticholinergic can be taken together at bedtime\n【257】 - to continue treatment for 3 months\n【258】 - that repeated courses can be used\n【259】 - Do not offer an anticholinergic combined with imipramine for the treatment of bedwetting in children and young people\n【260】 # Tricyclics\n【261】 - Do not use tricyclics as the first‑line treatment for bedwetting in children and young people\n【262】 - If offering a tricyclic, imipramine should be used for the treatment of bedwetting in children and young people\n【263】 - Consider imipramine for children and young people with bedwetting who:\n【264】 - have not responded to all other treatments and have been assessed by a healthcare professional with expertise in the management of bedwetting that has not responded to an alarm and/or desmopressin\n【265】 - If offering imipramine for bedwetting, inform the child or young person and their parents or carers:\n【266】 - that many children and young people, but not all, will experience a reduction in wetness\n【267】 - how imipramine works\n【268】 - that it should be taken at bedtime\n【269】 - that the dose should be increased gradually\n【270】 - about relapse rates (for example, more than two out of three children and young people will relapse after a 3‑month course of imipramine)\n【271】 - that the initial treatment course is for 3 months and further courses may be considered\n【272】 - about the particular dangers of imipramine overdose, and the importance of taking only the prescribed amount and storing it safely\n【273】 - Perform a medical review every 3 months in children and young people who are using repeated courses of imipramine for the management of bedwetting\n【274】 - Withdraw imipramine gradually when stopping treatment for bedwetting in children and young people\n【275】 # Training programmes for the management of bedwetting\n【276】 - Do not use strategies that recommend the interruption of urinary stream or encourage infrequent passing of urine during the day\n【277】 - Do not use dry‑bed training with or without an alarm for the treatment of bedwetting in children and young people\n【278】 # Children under 5 years with bedwetting\n【279】 - Children are generally expected to be dry at night by a developmental age of 5 years, and historically it has been common practice not to offer advice to families of children who are younger than 5 years and are bedwetting. This section provides recommendations specific to the under 5 age group indicating situations where healthcare professionals can offer useful advice and interventions\n【280】 - Reassure parents or carers that many children under 5 years wet the bed, for example, approximately one in five children of 4 and a half years wets the bed at least once a week\n【281】 - Ask whether toilet training has been attempted, and if not, ask about the reasons for this and offer support and advice. If there are no reasons why toilet training should not be attempted, advise parents or carers to toilet train their child\n【282】 - Suggest a trial of at least 2 nights in a row without nappies or pull‑ups for a child with bedwetting who is under 5 years and has been toilet trained by day for longer than 6 months. Offer advice on alternative bed protection to parents and carers. Consider a longer trial in children:\n【283】 - who are older\n【284】 - who achieve a reduction in wetness\n【285】 - whose family circumstances allow the trial to continue\n【286】 - Advise the parents or carers of a child under 5 years with bedwetting that if the child wakes at night, they should take him or her to the toilet\n【287】 - Consider further assessment and investigation to exclude a specific medical problem for children over 2 years who, despite awareness of toileting needs and showing appropriate toileting behaviour, are struggling to not wet themselves during the day as well as the night. Assess children under 5 years with bedwetting for constipation, in line with constipation in children and young people (NICE guideline CG99), as undiagnosed chronic constipation is a common cause of wetting and soiling in younger children\n【288】 - For the purposes of the child mistreatment guideline, to consider maltreatment means that maltreatment is one possible explanation for the alerting feature or is included in the differential diagnosis\n【289】 - Lifting is carrying or walking a child to toilet. Lifting without waking means that effort is not made to ensure the child is fully woken. Waking means waking a child from sleep to take them to the toilet\n【290】 - Early signs of a response may include smaller wet patches, waking to the alarm, the alarm going off later and fewer times per night and fewer wet nights\n【291】 - Dry‑bed training is a training programme that may include combinations of a number of different behavioural interventions, and that may include rewards, punishment, training routines and waking routines, and may be undertaken with or without an alarm. on the scope of the guidance\n【292】 - NICE guidelines are developed in accordance with a scope that defines what the guideline will and will not cover\n【293】 - How this guideline was developed\n【294】 - NICE commissioned the National Collaborating Centre for Primary Care (now the National Clinical Guideline Centre) to develop this guideline. The Centre established a Guideline Development Group , which reviewed the evidence and developed the recommendations. An independent Guideline Review Panel oversaw the development of the guideline\n【295】 - There is more information about how NICE guidelines are developed on the NICE website.# Research recommendations\n【296】 - The Guideline Development Group has made the following recommendations for research, based on its review of evidence, to improve NICE guidance and patient care in the future. The Guideline Development Group's full set of research recommendations is detailed in the full guideline\n【297】 # Multicomponent treatments\n【298】 - What elements of multicomponent treatments (for example dry‑bed training and retention control training) are clinically effective and cost effective for treating bedwetting in children and young people under 19 years old?\n【299】 - Why this is important\n【300】 - It is not known which of the elements of multicomponent treatments (for example dry‑bed training and retention‑control training) are clinically effective and cost effective for treating bedwetting in children and young people under 19 years old. Data from randomised controlled trials of dry‑bed training and retention‑control training suggest that the treatments may be clinically effective. However, certain elements of the multicomponent treatments studied are not accepas a form of treatment due to their punitive nature. Further research is needed to establish which elements could be used effectively to treat bedwetting\n【301】 - Research should:\n【302】 - Use randomised controlled trials to test the effect of the different elements of dry‑bed training alone and in different combinations for the treatment of bedwetting\n【303】 - Use randomised controlled trials to test the effect of the different elements of retention control training alone and in different combinations for the treatment of bedwetting\n【304】 - Consider different age groups of children being treated, such as younger children (under 7 years) and older children (over 10 years), as the ability of children to take responsibility for their behaviour may be important\n【305】 - Clearly describe the techniques used, including who gave the instructions, the timing of the treatments and the setting\n【306】 - Outcomes of interest include: the number of children who achieved 14 consecutive dry nights, the number of children who remain dry at 6 months and 2 years after treatment, the mean number of wet nights after treatment, the change in the number of wet nights, the psychological effect of treatment, psychological effects (self‑esteem, self‑concept, PinQ), quality of life measures and drop outs\n【307】 # Standard interventions\n【308】 - What is the clinical and cost effectiveness of standard interventions, for example alarm and desmopressin, for treating bedwetting in children and young people under 19 years old?\n【309】 - Why this is important\n【310】 - The evidence base for management of bedwetting is poor. Studies are inadequately powered, symptoms are poorly defined and study populations are commonly children seen in secondary and tertiary centres. Follow‑up periods are often inadequate\n【311】 - Research should provide:\n【312】 - More subgroup data (for example, young children, children with daytime symptoms as well as bedwetting, children who were previously successful with subsequent relapse, children with sickle cell disease, children with severe wetting and children with special needs)\n【313】 - More robust statistical data in trials of standard interventions for treating bedwetting (for example, adequately powered to detect differences)\n【314】 - Data on longer term follow‑up\n【315】 - Data from populations at a primary care/community care level\n【316】 # Psychological functioning and quality of life\n【317】 - What is the impact of bedwetting upon the psychological functioning and quality of life of children and young people and their families? How do these change with treatment?\n【318】 - Why is this important?\n【319】 - There are relatively few studies that focus upon the psychological impact and health‑related quality of life of children who experience bedwetting. In addition, studies of effectiveness have focused on the achievement of dryness as the primary outcome rather than how treatment might affect social and psychological aspects as well as the quality of life of children and young people and their families\n【320】 - Research should:\n【321】 - Examine the psychological impact and quality of life of children and young people and their families as well as the effectiveness of treatment upon these aspects\n【322】 - Use standardised measures to assess the psychological impact of bedwetting on children and young people as well as the quality of life of the child or young person and family\n【323】 - Use standardised measures to assess change associated with treatment for bedwetting\n【324】 - Quality‑of‑life research of children and young people with bedwetting pre‑ and post‑treatment would also be very useful to inform further economic evaluation work\n【325】 # Complementary therapies\n【326】 - What is the effectiveness of complementary therapies (acupuncture and hypnotherapy) for reducing the number of wet beds and improving self‑esteem in children and young people who wet the bed, when they are used independently or in conjunction with conventional treatments?\n【327】 - Why this is important\n【328】 - Many families consider the use of complementary and/or alternative medicine (CAM) as a treatment option when conventional treatment 'fails' or in order to avoid drug or other treatments. There is very little evidence about the efficacy of many CAM treatments, but the use of CAM is widespread and increasing across the developed world. There is a clear need for more effective guidance for health professionals, so that they can give evidence‑based advice to patients about what does and does not work and what is and is not safe, and for the public\n【329】 - Research should:\n【330】 - Use randomised controlled trials to test the effect of using CAM therapies in addition to or instead of other treatments for bedwetting\n【331】 - Clearly describe the CAM therapies tested, including the provision of the treatment for both the treatment and the control group\n【332】 - Priority should be given to research on acupuncture and hypnotherapy but other CAM therapies should not be excluded\n【333】 - If possible, the comparative effectiveness and cost effectiveness of different CAM therapies should be tested\n【334】 - Outcomes of interest include: self‑esteem, number of dry nights, permanent or temporary nature of increased number of dry nights, quality of life, costs and social engagement\n【335】 # Bedwetting in adolescents\n【336】 - What is the prevalence of wetting and/or soiling in adolescence and what are the long‑term consequences for adolescents with these problems?\n【337】 - Why this is important\n【338】 - There is evidence that, for an important minority of children, wetting and soiling problems persist into late childhood and sometimes beyond puberty, but their prevalence is not clearly known. It has also recently been reported that in children who experience more frequent bedwetting (more than three times a week) it is more likely to persist into late childhood and adolescence. These studies suggest that, contrary to popular belief, wetting and soiling problems do not always resolve with increasing age. If wetting and soiling problems remain unresolved or untreated they can become socially and psychologically debilitating. There are no longitudinal cohort studies examining the impact of wetting and soiling on a wide range of outcomes in adolescence relating to mental health, education/school attainment, relationships with parents and peers, social activities and goals/aspirations for the future. Persistence of wetting and soiling problems into adolescence is likely to be accompanied by ridicule and bullying by peers and increasing intolerance from parents, especially if they believe that their child is to blame for the problem. Such reactions can only serve to exacerbate the young person's distress and may lead to delays in seeking help. In particular, teenagers who are unsuccessfully treated in childhood are often reluctant to seek help for wetting or soiling due to the severe embarrassment associated with the problem, and others may simply believe that no help is available\n【339】 - Research should:\n【340】 - Use adolescents own self‑reports of frequency of bedwetting, daytime wetting and soiling\n【341】 - Adapt existing trajectory models to incorporate information on the frequency of wetting and soiling to examine whether children with more frequent problems are more likely to experience continuing wetting and soiling into adolescence\n【342】 - Outcomes of interest include: the examination of mental health, psychosocial and educational outcomes and whether adolescents who have combined wetting and soiling are at increased risk of negative outcomes compared to those with wetting or soiling alone\n【343】 - A continence‑specific paediatric quality‑of‑life measurement tool.# Other versions of this guideline\n【344】 # Full guideline\n used to develop the guideline.

The aortic valve area is reduced in aortic stenosis, and the aortic valve area is the metric that is used to gauge the need for aortic valve replacement surgery.  The pressure gradient across a narrowed aortic valve cannot be used to gauge the need for valve replacement as the gradient may be low in patients with impaired left ventricular function\n【3】 # Pathophysiology\n【4】 - The normal aortic valve offers little or no resistance to the blood flow across the valve despite the high flow velocities. With progressive narrowing of the aortic valve (aortic stenosis), the aortic valve orifice offers progressively greater resistance to the blood flow through the valve with a consequent in the pressure gradient between the left ventricle and the aorta.  The latter can be calculated using echocardiographic flow velocities while the trans-valvular pressure gradient can be calculated using the following equation:\n【5】 - Pressure Gradient = 4 x (velocity of blood through the valve)2 mm Hg\n【6】 - However, the absence of a large gradient across the aortic valve does not exclude the presence of critical aortic stenosis. Patients with left ventricular dysfunction can no longer generate a pressure gradient, and they are referred to as having low pressure, low flow, low ejection fraction aortic stenosis.  Therefore, it is for this reason that the best measure of the severity of aortic stenosis is the aortic valve area and not the aortic valve gradient\n【7】 # Cardiac Catheterization\n【8】 - Simultaneous measurement of left ventricular output (measures the flow through the aortic valve) and the pressure gradient across the aortic valve provides the variables that are required to calculate the aortic valve area and resistance\n【9】 - Fluid dynamic mediated subvalvular pressure gradients are often present in patients with severe aortic stenosis in the absence of an anatomic subvalvular obstruction and constitute ~50% of the total measured transvalvular gradient.  The extent of increase in cardiac output during exercise is inversely related to the magnitude of subvalvular gradient\n【10】 # Aortic Valve Area\n【11】 - According to the current recommendations, following dobutamine infusion, if the aortic valve area increases to >1.2 cm2, and the mean pressure gradient rises above 30 mmHg, such patients may benefit from aortic valve replacement. Failure to achieve these improvements has shown to be associated with higher early surgical mortality in comparison to patients who can augment their contractility and gradient: 32-33% versus 5-7%, respectively. Additionally, 5-year survival was lower in patients who could not augment their contractility in comparison to those who could: 10–25% versus 88%, respectively\n【12】 - Aortic valve area can be calculated by the following two equations:\n【13】 - Gorlin Equation:\n【14】 - Aortic Valve Area (cms2) = (Stroke volume (mL/beat) ÷ Systolic ejection period (secs/beat)) ÷ (44.3 x square root of mean systolic pressure gradient between the left ventricle and aorta (mm Hg))\n【15】 - Hakki Equation:\n【16】 - Aortic Valve Area (cms2) = (Cardiac output (liters/minute)) ÷ (Square root of mean systolic pressure gradient between the left ventricle and aorta (mm Hg))\n【17】 # Aortic Valve Resistance\n【18】 - Cannon JD Jr et al, described the benefit of calculating aortic valve resistance in conjunction with the Gorlin formula to differentiate patients with true severe aortic stenosis from those with mild aortic stenosis. The clinical implication of this differentiation is that patients with mild aortic stenosis may not benefit from aortic valve replacement\n【19】 - Patients with high cardiac output with minimal or no increase in pressure gradient also fall into the category of mild aortic stenosis and may not benefit from aortic valve replacement\n【20】 - Furthermore, aortic valve resistance is less flow-dependent than aortic valve area which is of particular benefit in patients with low output aortic stenosis\n【21】 - Aortic valve resistance can be calculated using the equation:\n【22】 - Aortic Valve Resistance (dyne seconds per cms5) = { (Mean Pressure Gradient between the left ventricle and aorta (mm Hg) x Heart Rate (beats/min) x Systolic ejection period (secs/beat) ) ÷ Cardiac output } x 1.33\n【23】 - Unsteady fluid-dynamics support the use of aortic valve area calculation over other measures  of aortic stenosis including aortic valve resistance\n【24】 # 2020 ACC/AHA Guideline for the Management of Patients With Valvular Heart Disease: A Report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Joint Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines\n【25】 ## Recommendations for Diagnostic Testing: Initial Diagnosis of AS Referenced studies that support the recommendations are summarized in Online Data Supplement\n【26】 # Echocardiography\n【27】 - Based on Bernoulli's equation, using doppler echocardiography the pressure gradient across the valve can be measured using the formula: Pressure Gradient (mm Hg) = 4 x (Maximum Stenotic Jet Velocity)2 - 4 x (Left Ventricular Outflow Tract Velocity)2\n【28】 - However, for all practical purposes, since the left ventricular outflow tract velocity is usually less than 1 m/sec; the above equation can be simplified into:Maximum Pressure Gradient (mm Hg) = 4 x (Maximum stenotic Jet Velocity)2\n【29】 - The above two equations derived, aid in calculating the maximum pressure gradient that is obtained using the instantaneous aortic jet velocity that is assessed with doppler echocardiography; however, cardiac catheterization is required to calculate peak pressure gradient across the valve\n【30】 # Aortic Valve Area\n【31】 - The continuity principle states that the flow in one area must equal the flow in a second area if there are no shunts in between the two areas\n【32】 - Using doppler velocities, aortic valve area can be calculated using the following continuity pinciple:\n【33】 - Aortic Valve Area (cms2) = { (Cross-sectional Area of LVOT x Time Velocity Integral across the LVOT) ÷ (Time Velocity Integral across Aortic Valve) }\n【34】 - The weakest aspect of this calculation is the variability in measurement of cross-sectional area of LVOT, because it involves squaring the LVOT dimension. Such variations in the aortic valve area derived using doppler velocities may be observed during exercise or in conditions that increase the blood flow across the valve\n【35】 - Based on a study that simultaneously determined Gorlin formula and transesophageal echocardiography planimetry valve areas, demonstrated that acute changes in trans-valvular blood flow substantially altered valve area as calculated by the Gorlin formula but did not result in significant alterations of the anatomic valve area in aortic stenosis. This suggests that the flow-related variation in the Gorlin aortic valve area may be due to a disproportionate blood flow dependence of the formula itself and not a true change in valve area. Therefore, the advantage of continuity equation over Gorlin formula is that the former is less susceptible to blood flow across the valve\n【36】 # Aortic Valve Resistance\n【37】 - Doppler derived aortic valve resistance correlates well with catheterization derived aortic valve resistance and hence may provide an additional non-invasive parameter for the assessment of aortic stenosis severity\n【38】 - Although all doppler echocardiographic indexes of aortic stenosis are affected by  blood flow, aortic valve resistance is more sthan aortic valve area under dobutamine-induced hemodynamic changes. However, baseline aortic valve area may be unreliable in patients with calcific degenerative aortic stenosis and low cardiac output states", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-15 17:51:29", "update_time": "2024-04-15 21:46:30"}

It's easy!  Click  here  to learn about editing\n【2】 # Overview\n【3】 - Hemopneumothorax is a medical term describing the combination of two conditions: pneumothorax, or air in the chest cavity, and hemothorax (also called hæmothorax), or blood in the chest cavity. The resulting condition is a serious state wherein respiration is repressed. The blood and air fill the pleural space, the space between the lung and the chest wall, putting pressure on the lung.  This can cause the lung to collapse and be unable to fill with air (unilateral hemopneumothorax).  In the most serious of cases, both lungs may collapse (bilateral hemopneumothorax).  Death follows if respiration is inhibited enough\n【4】 # Treatment\n【5】 - Treatment for this condition is exactly the same as for its separate states, by tube thoracostomy—the insertion of a chest drain through an incision made between the ribs, into the intercostal space. Commonly, surgery is needed to close off whatever injuries caused the bleeding into the lung cavity and also whatever injuries caused the air to enter the cavity (e.g stabbing, broken ribs, etc.)", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": "无关文本#1#1#上下语义不一致", "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-15 17:51:29", "update_time": "2024-04-15 18:24:26"}

Asthma - Patients with highly unsasthma are at greater risk of fatal reactions from skin tests than are patients without asthma, especially during seasonal exacerbations of the disease. Also, the combination of unsasthma and treatment with B-adrenergic blockers appears to increase this risk5. Allergenic extract should be temporarily withheld from patients if any of the following conditions exist: 1 severe symptoms of hay fever and/or asthma; 2 infection or flu accompanied by fever; and 3 exposure to excessive amounts of clinically relevant allergen(s) prior to skin testing\n【28】 # Warnings\n【29】 - Physicians who use allergenic extracts should have a knowledge and practical understanding of allergy skin testing as described in the published literature6,7,8\n【30】 - Allergenic extracts are manufactured to assure high potency and therefore have the ability to cause serious local and systemic reactions, including death in highly sensitive patients5. Patients should be informed of the risks of skin testing and instructed in the recognition of symptoms of an adverse allergic reaction\n【31】 - Excessively large local reactions or systemic reactions are more likely to occur if the patient is skin tested shortly after exposure to allergens to which he or she is sensitive\n【32】 # Adverse Reactions\n【33】 # Clinical Trials Experience\n【34】 - Local reactions large, persistent local reactions or minor exacerbations of the patient's allergic symptoms may be treated by local cold applications and/or the use of oral anti-histamines\n【35】 - Systemic reactions Allergenic extracts are highly potent and in highly sensitive individuals can cause systemic symptoms, including anaphylaxis. It cannot be overemphasized that anaphylactic shock is always a possibility under certain unprediccombinations of circumstances. Other possible systemic reaction symptoms may include fainting, pallor, bradycardia, hypotension, angioedema, cough, wheezing, conjunctivitis, rhinitis and urticaria. Therefore, it is imperative that physicians administering skin tests understand and be prepared to treat severe allergic reactions\n【36】 - If a systemic or anaphylactic reaction occurs during or following skin testing, the patient should be treated with 1:1000 epinephrine hydrochloride. The recommended dose: infants to 2 years of age 0.05 to 0.1 mL, children 2 to 6 years, 0.15 mL, children 6 to 12 years, 0.2 mL, adults 0.3 - 0.5 mL. If necessary, treatment may be repeated up to three times every 10 - 15 minutes\n【37】 - After administration of epinephrine, profound shock or vasomotor collapse should be treated with intravenous fluids and possibly vasoactive drugs. Oxygen should be given by mask. Intravenous antihistamine, aminophylline, inhaled bronchodilators or adrenal corticosteroids may be used if necessary after adequate epinephrine and circulatory support have been given. Emergency resuscitation measures and personnel trained in their use should be available immediately. The physician should be prepared in advance for all contingencies. Promptness in beginning emergency treatment is of utmost importance14\n【38】 - Serious adverse reactions should be reported to MedWatch: The FDA Safety Information and Adverse Event Reporting Program, Office Of The Center Director, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, 5515 Security Lane, Suite 5100, Rockville, MD 20852, Telephone  332-1088\n【39】 ## Postmarketing Experience\n【40】 - There is limited information regarding Postmarketing Experience of Trichophyton mentagrophytes and trichophyton rubrum in the drug label\n【41】 # Drug Interactions\n【42】 - Treatment with beta-blocking drugs may make patients refractory to the usual dose of epinephrine, in the event epinephrine is required to control an adverse reaction11\n【43】 - Since drugs may affect the reactivity of the skin, patients should be instructed to avoid medications, particularly antihistamines and sympathomimetic drugs for at least 24 hours prior to skin testing. Non-sedating antihistamine suppresses the erythema/edema response for longer periods and should be withheld according to information included in the package insert. Adrenal corticosteroids and ACTH do not alter the immediate hypersensitivity reaction of the skin but do reduce delayed-type reactions associated with cellular hypersensitivity\n【44】 # Usein Specific Populations\n【45】 ### Pregnancy\n【46】 - Pregnancy Category (FDA):\n【47】 - PREGNANCY CATEGORY C Allergenic Extracts. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with allergenic extracts. It is also not known whether allergenic extracts can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Allergenic extracts should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Since studies indicate no increased risk to the fetus or to the mother who is treated cautiously with immunotherapy during a normal pregnancy, it is unlikely that extract administered by skin test will be harmful. However, on the basis of histamine's known ability to contract uterine muscle, extensive testing with its possibility of histamine release should be avoided during pregnancy. Also, immunologic suppressive action can occur during pregnancy and for this reason it is possible that the results of allergy skin tests may not accurately reflect the allergic state of the pregnant patient12\n【48】 - Pregnancy Category (AUS):\n【49】 - Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) Pregnancy Category\n【50】 - There is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Trichophyton mentagrophytes and trichophyton rubrum in women who are pregnant\n【51】 ### Labor and Delivery\n【52】 - There is no FDA guidance on use of Trichophyton mentagrophytes and trichophyton rubrum during labor and delivery\n【53】 ### Nursing Mothers\n【54】 - It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when allergenic extract is administered to a nursing woman\n【55】 ### Pediatric Use\n【56】 - The procedures and precautions that are observed in skin testing adults should be observed with children\n【57】 ### Geriatic Use\n【58】 - There is no FDA guidance on the use of Trichophyton mentagrophytes and trichophyton rubrum with respect to geriatric patients\n【59】 ### Gender\n【60】 - There is no FDA guidance on the use of Trichophyton mentagrophytes and trichophyton rubrum with respect to specific gender populations\n【61】 ### Race\n【62】 - There is no FDA guidance on the use of Trichophyton mentagrophytes and trichophyton rubrum with respect to specific racial populations\n【63】 ### Renal Impairment\n【64】 - There is no FDA guidance on the use of Trichophyton mentagrophytes and trichophyton rubrum in patients with renal impairment\n【65】 ### Hepatic Impairment\n【66】 - There is no FDA guidance on the use of Trichophyton mentagrophytes and trichophyton rubrum in patients with hepatic impairment\n【67】 # Femalesof Reproductive Potentialand Males\n【68】 - There is no FDA guidance on the use of Trichophyton mentagrophytes and trichophyton rubrum in women of reproductive potentials and males\n【69】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\n【70】 - There is no FDA guidance one the use of Trichophyton mentagrophytes and trichophyton rubrum in patients who are immunocompromised\n【71】 # Administration and Monitoring\n【72】 ### Administration\n【73】 - Dermal Patch\n【74】 - Prior to administering skin tests, the skin should be cleaned with alcohol and allowed to dry completely.

Persistent wheezing may necessitate treatment with intravenous aminophylline and inhaled bronchodilators. For profound shock and hypotension, intravenous fluids, vasopressors and oxygen also may be needed\n【86】 - Maintenance of an open airway is critical if upper airway obstruction is present. Corticosteroids may provide benefit if symptoms are prolonged or recurrent\n【87】 # Pharmacology\n【88】 ## Mechanism of Action\n【89】 - There is limited information regarding Mechanism of Action of Trichophyton mentagrophytes and trichophyton rubrum in the drug label\n【90】 ## Structure\n【91】 - Trichophyton extract for diagnostic skin testing is a sterile solution that is prepared by extracting allergenic source material of equal parts of Trichophyton mentagrophytes and Trichophyton rubrum with an aqueous solution of 0.25% sodium chloride, 0.125% sodium bicarbonate and 50% glycerol v/v.

{"id": 974954, "user_id": "65e7dd234a08e7753ad36f9f", "user_name": " 黄艳玲", "task_id": 633, "source_info": {"seq_id": "6335892d-e457-4a36-b30b-3f10e42ac8d6", "title": null, "text": "【0】 - Network effect\n【1】 - Network effect is a term used narrowly to describe business phenomena, or more broadly to describe non-business phenomena\n【2】 - In the narrow usage, a network effect is a characteristic that causes a good or service to have a value to a potential customer which depends on the number of other customers who own the good or are users of the service. In other words, the number of prior adopters is a term in the value available to the next adopter\n【3】 - One consequence of a network effect is that the purchase of a good by one individual indirectly benefits others who own the good — for example by purchasing a telephone a person makes other telephones more useful.  This type of side-effect in a transaction is known as an externality in economics, and externalities arising from network effects are known as\n【4】 - network externalities. The resulting bandwagon effect is an example of a positive feedback loop\n【5】 # Origins\n【6】 - Network effects were a central theme in the arguments of Theodore Vail, the first post patent president of Bell Telephone, in gaining a monopoly on telephone services.  In 1908, when he presented the concept in Bell's annual report, there were over 4000 local and regional telephone exchanges, most of which were eventually merged into the Bell System.  The economics of network effects were presented in a paper by Bell employee N. Lytkins in 1917, where the term network externality was used\n【7】 - Network effects were more recently popularized by Robert Metcalfe, the founder of Ethernet. In selling the product, Metcalfe argued that customers needed Ethernet cards to grow above a certain critical mass if they were to reap the benefits of their network\n【8】 - According to Metcalfe, the rationale behind the sale of networking cards was that  the cost of cards was proportional to the number of cards installed, but  the value of the network was proportional to the square of the number of users. This was expressed algebraically as having a cost of \"N\", and a value of \"N^2\". While the actual numbers behind this definition were never firm, the concept allowed customers to share access to expensive resources like disk drives and printers, send e-mail, and access the internet\n【9】 # Benefits\n【10】 - Network effects become significant after a certain subscription percentage has been achieved, called critical mass. At the critical mass point, the value obtained from the good or service is greater than or equal to the price paid for the good or service. As the value of the good is determined by the user base, this implies that after a certain number of people have subscribed to the service or purchased the good, additional people will subscribe to the service or purchase the good due to the positive utility:price ratio\n【11】 - A key business concern must then be how to attract users prior to reaching critical mass. One way is to rely on extrinsic motivation, such as a payment, a fee waiver, or a request for friends to sign up. A more natural strategy is to build a system that has enough value without network effects, at least to early adopters. Then, as the number of users increases, the system becomes even more valuable and is able to attract a wider user base. Joshua Schachter has explained that he built  along these lines - he built an online system where he could keep bookmarks for himself, such that even if no other user joined, it would still be valuable to him. It was relatively easy to build up a user base from zero because early adopters found enough value in the system outside of the network aspects. The same could be said for many other successful websites which derive value from network effects, e.g. Flickr, MySpace\n【12】 - Beyond critical mass, the increasing number of subscribers generally cannot continue indefinitely.  After a certain point, most networks become either congested or saturated, stopping future uptake.  Congestion occurs due to overuse.  The applicable analogy is that of a telephone network.  While the number of users is below the congestion point, each additional user adds additional value to every other customer.  However, at some point the addition of an extra user exceeds the capacity of the existing system.  After this point, each additional user decreases the value obtained by every other user.  In practical terms, each additional user increases the total system load, leading to busy signals, the inability to get a dial tone, and poor customer support.  The next critical point is where the value obtained again equals the price paid.  The network will cease to grow at this point, and the system must be enlarged.  The congestion point may be larger than the market size.  New Peer-to-peer technological models may always defy congestion.  Peer-to-Peer systems, or \"P2P,\" are networks designed to distribute load among their user pool. This theoretically allows true P2P networks to scale indefinitely.  The P2P based telephony service Skype benefits greatly from this effect.  But market saturation will still occur\n【13】 - Network effects are commonly mistaken for economies of scale, which result from business size rather than interoperability .  To help clarify the distinction, people speak of demand side vs. supply side economies of scale.  Classical economies of scale are on the production side, while network effects arise on the demand side. Network effects are also mistaken for economies of scope\n【14】 - The network effect has a lot of similarities with the description of phenomenon in reinforcing positive feedback loops description of system dynamics (Sterman 2000). System dynamics could be used as a modeling method to describe such phenomenon such as word of mouth and Bass model of marketing\n【15】 # Business examples\n【16】 ## Financial exchanges\n【17】 - Stock exchanges and derivatives exchanges feature a network effect.  Market liquidity is a major determinant of transaction cost in the sale or purchase of a security, as a bid-ask spread exists between the price at which a purchase can be done versus the price at which the sale of the same security can be done.  As the number of buyers and sellers on an exchange increases, liquidity increases, and transaction costs decrease.  This then attracts a larger number of buyers and sellers to the exchange\n【18】 - The network advantage of financial exchanges is apparent in the difficulty that startup exchanges have in dislodging a dominant exchange.  For example, the Chicago Board of Trade has retained overwhelming dominance of trading in US Treasury Bond futures despite the startup of Eurex US trading of identical futures contracts.  Similarly, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange has maintained a dominance in trading of Eurobond interest rate futures despite a challenge from Euronext.Liffe\n【19】 ## Software\n【20】 - There are very strong network effects operating in the market for widely used computer software\n【21】 - Take for example Microsoft Office.  For many people choosing an office suite, prime considerations include how valuable having learned that office suite will prove to potential employers, and how well the software interoperates with other users.  That is, since learning to use an office suite takes many hours, they want to invest that time learning the office suite that will make them most attractive to potential employers (or consulting clients, etc), and they also want to be able to share documents. (Additionally, an example of an indirect network effect in this case is the nosimilarity in user-interfaces and operability menus of most new software - since that similarity directly translates into less time spent learning new environments, therefore potentially greater acceptance and adoption of those products.)\n【22】 - Similarly, finding already-trained employees is a big concern for employers when deciding which office suite to purchase or standardize on.  The lack of cross-platform user-interface standards results in a situation in which one firm is in control of almost 100% of the market\n【23】 - Microsoft Windows is a further example of network effect.  The most-vaunted advantage of Windows, and that most publicised by Microsoft, is that Windows is compatible with the widest range of hardware and software.  Although this claim was justified at some point of time, it was in reality the result of network effect: hardware and software manufacturers ensure that their products are compatible with Windows in order to have access to the large market of Windows users.  Thus, Windows is popular because it is well supported, but is well supported because it is popular\n【24】 - However, network effects need not lead to market dominance by one firm, when there are standards which allow multiple firms to interoperate, thus allowing the network externalities to benefit the entire market.  This is true for the case of x86-based personal computer hardware, in which there are extremely strong market pressures to interoperate with pre-existing standards, but in which no one firm dominates in the market.  The same holds true for the market for long-distance telephone service within the United States.  In fact, the existence of these types of networks discourages dominance of the market by one company, as it creates pressures which work against one company attempting to establish a proprietary protocol or to even distinguish itself by means of product differentiation\n【25】 - In cases in which the relevant communication protocols or interfaces are closed standards the network effect can give the company controlling those standards monopoly power. The Microsoft corporation is widely seen by computer professionals as maintaining its monopoly through these means. One observed method Microsoft uses to put the network effect to its advantage is called embrace and extend (derisively called embrace, extend, and extinguish)\n【26】 - Mirabilis is an Israeli start-up which pioneered instant messaging (IM) and was bought by America Online. By giving away their ICQ product for free and preventing interoperability between their client software and other products, they were able to temporarily dominate the market for instant messaging. Because of the network effect, new IM users gained much more value by choosing to use the Mirabilis system (and join its large network of users) than they would using a competing system. As was typical for that era, the company never made any attempt to generate profits from their dominant position before selling the company\n【27】 ## Web sites\n【28】 - Many web sites also feature a network effect. One example is web marketplaces and exchanges, in that the value of the marketplace to a new user is proportional to the number of other users in the market.  For example, eBay would not be a particularly useful site if auctions were not competitive. However, as the number of users grows on eBay, auctions grow more competitive, pushing up the prices of bids on items. This makes it more worthwhile to sell on eBay and brings more sellers onto eBay, which drives prices down again as this increases supply, while bringing more people onto eBay because there are more things being sold that people want. Essentially, as the number of users of eBay grows, prices fall and supply increases, and more and more people find the site to be useful\n【29】 - The collaborative encyclopedia Wikipedia also benefits from a network effect. The theory goes that as the number of editors grows, the quality of information on the website improves, encouraging more users to turn to it as a source of information; some of the new users in turn become editors, continuing the process\n【30】 - Social networking websites are also good examples. The more people register onto a social networking website, the more useful the website is to its registrants\n【31】 - By contrast, the value of a news site is primarily proportional to the quality of the articles, not to the number of other people using the site.  Similarly, the first generation of search sites experienced little network effect, as the value of the site was based on the value of the search results.  This allowed Google to win users away from Yahoo! without much trouble, once users believed that Google's search results were superior.  Some commentators mistook the value of the Yahoo! brand (which does increase as more people know of it) for a network effect protecting its advertising business\n【32】 - Alexa Internet uses a technology that tracks users' surfing patterns; thus Alexa's Related Sites results improve as more users use the technology. As theory would predict, no competing technology has emerged to compete successfully with Alexa, but this may be because of other factors.  Alexa's network relies heavily on a small number of browser software relationships, which makes the network more vulnerable to competition\n【33】 - Google has also attempted to create a network effect in its advertising business with its Google AdSense service.  Google AdSense places ads on many small sites, such as blogs, using Google technology to determine which ads are relevant to which blogs.  Thus, the service appears to aim to serve as an exchange (or ad network) for matching many advertisers with many small sites (such as blogs).  In general, the more blogs Google AdSense can reach, the more advertisers it will attract, making it the most attractive option for more blogs, and so on, making the network more valuable for all participants\n【34】 - Network effects were used as justification for some of the dot-com business models in the late 1990s. These firms operated under the belief that when a new market comes into being which contains strong network effects, firms should care more about growing their market share than about becoming profi  This was believed because market share will determine which firm can set technical and marketing standards and thus determine the basis of future competition\n【35】 # Technology lifecycle\n【36】 - If some existing technology or company whose benefits are largely based on network effects starts to lose market share against a challenger such as a disruptive technology or open standards based competition, the benefits of network effects will reduce for the incumbent, and increase for the challenger\n【37】 - In this model, a tipping point is eventually reached at which the network effects of the challenger dominate those of the former incumbent, and the incumbent is forced into an accelerating decline, whilst the challenger takes over the incumbent's former position\n【38】 ## Lock-in\n【39】 - Not surprisingly network economics became a hot topic after the diffusion of the Internet across academia. Most people know only of Metcalfe's law as part of network effects. Network effects are notorious for causing vendor lock-in with the most-cited examples being Microsoft products and the qwerty keyboard\n【40】 - Network effects are a source of, but distinct from, lock-in. Lock-in can result from network effects, and network effects generate increasing returns that are associated with lock-in. However, the presence of a network effect does not guarantee that lock-in will result. For example, if the network is open there is no issue of lock-in\n【41】 ## Types of network effects\n【42】 - There are two kinds of economic value to be concerned about when thinking of network effects:\n【43】 - Inherent — my value from me using the product\n【44】 - Network — my value from you using the product\n【45】 - Network value itself can be direct or indirect\n【46】 - Direct network value is an immediate result of other users adopting the same system.  Some examples of this are fax machines and email\n【47】 - Indirect is a secondary result of many people using the same system. For example, complementary goods are cheaper or more available  when many people adopt a standard. Toner may be cheaper for widely used printers.  An example of this is that Windows and Linux can be seen as competing not for users, but for software developers, as shown by\n【48】 - Nicholas Economides and Evangelos Katsamakas\n【49】 ## Negative and positive network effects\n【50】 - Positive network effects are obvious. More people means more interaction. Wikipedia itself depends on positive network effects. Negative network effects beyond lock-in also exist\n【51】 - Negative network effects result from resource limits. Consider the connection that overloads the freeway — or the competition for bandwidth. In fact, the automobile and ethernet congestion examples illustrate that there can be threshold limits. In this case, the n+1 person begins to decrease the value of a network if additional resources are not provided\n【52】 - The result is that in some networks there is an exclusion value. This is clear to anyone who has considered problems of authentication or trust on the modern internet\n【53】 - Another negative network effect is provider complacency. The absence of viable competitors in a successful network can cause a provider to restrict resources, consider fee increases, or otherwise create an environment contrary to the users' benefit. These situations are typically accompanied by vocal complaints from the users. (In a competitive environment the users would simply change vendors rather than complain.)\n【54】 - Classic examples are the United States Postal Service or telephone companies during the 1960s and 1970s.

A mole is defined as this number of \"entities\" (usually, atoms or molecules) of any material.  The currently accepted value for this number is:\n【2】 - The value of Avogadro's constant was first indicated by Johann Josef Loschmidt who, in 1865, computed the number of particles in one cubic centimetre of gas held at standard conditions.  The term Loschmidt constant is thus more correctly applied for this value, which can be said to be proportional to the Avogadro number. However, in the German language literature, \"Loschmidt constant\" refers to both this quantity as well as the number of entities in a mole\n【3】 # History and etymology\n【4】 - The Avogadro constant is named after the early nineteenth century Italian scientist Amedeo Avogadro, who is credited  with being the first to realize that the volume of a gas (strictly, of an ideal gas) is proportional to the number of atoms or molecules\n【5】 - The French chemist Jean Baptiste Perrin in 1909 proposed naming the constant in honor of Avogadro. American chemistry textbooks picked it up in the 1930s followed by high school textbooks starting in the 1950s\n【6】 ## Loschmidt: Measuring the Avogadro Number\n【7】 - Avogadro never attempted to measure the constant: the numerical value was first estimated by the Austrian physicist Johann Josef Loschmidt in 1865 using the kinetic theory of gases. In German-speaking countries, the constant is sometimes referred to as the Loschmidt constant or Loschmidt's number, but what Loschmidt actually measured is the number of particles per unit volume of an ideal gas, i.e. the number density of particles in an ideal gas. Thus, the term Loschmidt constant is more appropriate to the number of particles per unit of gas, Symbol: no:\n【8】 - equal to  (2.686 7774 ± 0.000 0047) × 1025 m−3 at 273.15 K and 101.325 kPa with kB the Boltzmann constant, T the temperature and p the pressure\n【9】 - This constant is related to the Avogadro constant by the relation:\n【10】 - with kB the Boltzmann constant, and  R the gas constant,  hence\n【11】 - However, in German scientific literature, the term Loschmidt constant is used ambiguously - it often refers to what has come to be known as Avogadro number.  However, Boltzmann had first used the term for the sense in which Loschmidt had measured it - the number of particles in a unit volume of gas.  Thus, its use in referring to the related Avogadro number leads to confusion and is usually deprecated.  For the same reason, sometimes the Avogadro Number is denoted as L as opposed to NA in German texts\n【12】 ## Standardization of the mole\n【13】 - Before 1960, there were conflicting definitions of the mole, and hence of the Avogadro number (as it was known at the time), based on 16 grams of oxygen: physicists generally used oxygen-16 while chemists generally used the \"naturally occurring\" isotope ratio\n【14】 - Switching, in 1960, to 12 grams of carbon-12 as the basis ended this dispute and had other advantages. At this time, the Avogadro number was defined as the number of atoms in 12 grams of carbon-12, that is as a dimensionless quantity, while a mole was defined as one Avogadro number of atoms, molecules or other entities\n【15】 - When the mole entered the International System of Units (SI), in 1971, the definitions were interchanged\n【16】 - In 1971, a mole was defined as the number of atoms in 12 grams of carbon-12, with its own dimension, namely \"amount of substance\". Avogadro's number became a physical constant with the unit of reciprocal moles (mol−1)\n【17】 - While Avogadro’s constant is a dimensionless quantity, it is currently based on a single physical property (the defined gram, hence the golden karat). Since instruments are unable to measure that property accurately beyond 10 places it is not known to an integer value. The Binary Mole, on the other hand, defines a precise integer value for the units that occur in a mole without any such analytical attachment. Thus, the binary mole is an integer of 24 digits:\n【18】 - r 6.0446 x 1023 to 5-significant digits for mathematical calculations\n【19】 # Application\n【20】 - The Avogadro constant can be applied to any substance. It corresponds to the number of atoms or molecules needed to make up a mass equal to the substance's atomic or molecular mass, in grams. For example, the atomic mass of iron is 55.847 g/mol, so NA iron atoms (i.e. one mole of iron atoms) have a mass of 55.847 g. Conversely, 55.847 g of iron contains NA iron atoms. The Avogadro constant also enters into the definition of the unified atomic mass unit, u:\n【21】 # Additional physical relations\n【22】 - Because of its role as a scaling factor, the Avogadro number provides the link between a number of useful physical constants when moving between the atomic scale and the macroscopic scale. For example, it provides the relationship between:\n【23】 - the gas constant R and the Boltzmann constant kB:\n【24】 - the Faraday constant F and the elementary charge e:\n【25】 # Measurement of the Avogadro constant\n【26】 - A number of methods can be used to measure the Avogadro constant. One modern method is to calculate the Avogadro constant from the density (ρ) of a crystal, the relative atomic mass (M), and the unit cell length (a) determined from x-ray crystallography. Very accurate values of these quantities for silicon have been measured at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and used to obtain the value of the Avogadro constant:", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type4": "无意义文本#0#26#全文与医疗无关"}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-15 17:51:29", "update_time": "2024-04-15 18:41:40"}

GBR is similar to guided tissue regeneration (GTR) but is focused on development of hard tissues instead of soft tissues of periodontal attachment. At present, guided bone regeneration is predominantly applied in the oral cavity to support new hard tissue growth on an alveolar ridge to allow splacement of dental implants. Used in conjunction with sound surgical technique, GBR is a reliable and validated procedure\n【3】 # History\n【4】 - Use of barrier membranes to direct bone regeneration was first described in the context of orthopaedic research by Hurley et al., in 1959  The theoretical principles basic to guided tissue regeneration were developed by Melcher in 1976, who outlined the necessity of excluding unwanted cell lines from healing sites to allow growth of desired tissues.  Based on positive clinical results of regeneration in periodontology research in the 1980's, research began to focus on the potential for re-building alveolar bone defects using guided bone regeneration\n【5】 # Basic Principles\n【6】 'The PASS Principle' published by Wang & Boyapati is an acronym outlining the fundamental rationale and stages of successful barrier membrane regeneration, both for bone and other tissues, and is a guide to the physiological processes central in tissue regeneration\n【7】 - PRIMARY CLOSURE of the wound to promote undisturbed and uninterrupted healing\n【8】 - ANGIOGENESIS to provided necessary blood supply and undifferentiated mesenchymal cells\n【9】 - SPACE creation and maintenance to facilitate space for bone in-growth\n【10】 - STABILITY of the wound to induce blood clot formation and allow uneventful healing\n【11】 # GBRindentistry\n【12】 - The first application of barrier membranes in the oral cavity was by Nyman, Lindhe, Karring and Gottlow  in the context of regeneration of periodontal tissues via GTR, as an alternative to ressective surgical procedures to reduce pocket depths\n【13】 # GBRinmedicine\n【14】 # Typesof Barrier Membranes Used\n【15】 - Barrier membranes have been derived from a variety of sources, both natural and synthetic, and are marketed under various trade names.  Membranes used in GBR and grafting may be of two principal varieties, non-resorbable and resorbable\n【16】 # Non-Resorbable Membranes\n【17】 - Historically, GBR and grafting techniques began with impractical millipore (paper) filter barriers.  Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) membranes were first used by Gottlow et al.  which are non-resorbable but biocompatible synthetic polymer membranes of the Teflon trade name.  Although ePTFE are considered the standard for membranes and excellent outcomes have been achieved with this material,  it is desirable to both the clinician and patient to minimize risk by reducing the frequency of surgical intervention.  Consequently, resorbable or bioabsorbable membranes have been developed to avoid the limitations of ePTFE, which must be surgically retrieved in 4-6 weeks and are often contaminated by bacteria through premature exposure, limiting potential increases in bone volume.   Non-absorbable ePTFE membranes are still used clinically on a regular basis, and long-term studies have shown ePTFE GBR bone responds to implants like non-augmented naive bone\n【18】 ### Resorbable Membranes\n【19】 - Resorbable membranes are either animal-derived or synthetic polymers. They are gradually hydrolyzed or enzymatically degraded and therefore do not require a second surgical stage of membrane removal.  Their sources are varied, beginning in early years with rat collagen, bovine collagen, ox cecum cargile membrane, polylactic  acid, polyacetic acid, polyglycolic acid, polyglactin 910(Vicryl), synthetic skin (Biobrane) and freeze-dried dura mater.   Recently developed synthetic membranes are often combinations of various materials\n【20】 - Collagen resorbable membranes -  Collagen membranes are of either type I or II collagen from bovine or porcine sources.  They are often cross-linked and resorbed between 4 - 38 weeks depending on the type.  Brands of collagen barriers include Biomend, Biomend Extend, OSSIX, Neomem, and Hypro-Sorb.   Collagen absorbable barrier membranes are being used more frequently for their specific advantages over non-absorbable ones.  They relieve the need for a second stage surgery, inhibit migration of epithelial cells and promote new connective tissue attachment, have low antigenic properties, and assist in haemostasis by platelet aggregation leading to early clot formation and wound stabilization.8,11  Collagen membranes may also facilitate primary wound closure via fibroblast chemotactic properties,11  even after membrane exposure.  Compared to ePTFE membranes, resorbable barriers allow for fewer exposures and therefore reduce the effects of infection on newly formed bone.   Use of collagen membranes in particular, with bone mineral as a support and space maintainer, has achieved predictreatment outcomes\n【21】 - Synthetic resorbable membranes - Synthetic membranes may be polymers of lactic acid or glycolic acid.  Their ester bonds are degraded over 30-60 days, leaving free acids that may be pro-inflammatory.  The majority of studies consider synthetics comparable to other membranes like ePTFE and collagen, and one author has found synthetics clinically superior to collagen membranes.  There are several types of synthetics: Vicryl, Atrisorb, Atrisorb-FreeFlow, Arisorb-D, Resolut XT, Epi-Gide and Gore Resolut Adapt, each made predominantly of acid polymers.  In addition, Capset is a calcium sulphate derivative synthetic membrane\n【22】 - The integrity of resorbable membranes over the healing period has been questioned, relative to the ePTFE membranes, however, Hammerle et al  indicate that the barrier function of the collagen membranes does allow for bone regeneration, provided that it is used with appropriate case selection.  Donos et al  also indicates that synthetic resorbable membranes hold their barrier capabilities for at least 30 days after insertion.  Appreciation of the clinical success or failure for a specific membrane type is difficult to derive, since most studies do not use appropriate controls or fail to separate data by which type resorbable membrane was used", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": "无关文本#20#20#8,11     11 ", "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-15 17:51:29", "update_time": "2024-04-15 18:05:52"}
