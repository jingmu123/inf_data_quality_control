{"seq_id": "6e38cf03-e15f-4765-8162-168daf6653e2", "title": null, "text": "【0】 Head injury: assessment and early management\n\n【1】 This guideline covers assessment and early management of head injury in babies, children, young people and adults. It aims to ensure that people have the right care for the severity of their head injury, including direct referral to specialist care if needed.\n\n【2】 # Recommendations\nPeople have the right to be involved in discussions and make informed decisions about their care, as described in NICE's information on making decisions about your care.\nMaking decisions using NICE guidelines explains how we use words to show the strength (or certainty) of our recommendations, and has information about prescribing medicines (including off-label use), professional guidelines, standards and laws (including on consent and mental capacity), and safeguarding.\nFor the purposes of this guideline, a head injury is defined as any trauma to the head other than superficial injuries to the face. Also, babies are defined as being under 1 year, and children and young people as being 1 year to under 16 years.\n\n【3】 # Decision making and mental capacity\nFor recommendations on promoting ways for healthcare professionals and people using services to work together to make decisions about treatment and care, see NICE's guideline on shared decision making. \nFor recommendations on decision making in people 16 and over who may lack capacity now or in the future, including information on advance care plans, see NICE's guideline on decision making and mental capacity. \nFor a short explanation of why the committee made these recommendations and how they might affect practice or services, see the rationale and impact section on decision making and mental capacity .\n\n【4】 # Pre-hospital assessment, advice and referral to hospital\nPublic health literature and other non-medical sources of advice (for example, St John Ambulance and police officers) should encourage people who have any concerns after a head injury to themselves or to another person, regardless of the injury severity, to seek immediate medical advice. \n\n【5】 ## Remote advice services\nRemote advice services (for example, NHS  should refer people who have sustained a head injury to the emergency ambulance services (that is,  for emergency transport to the emergency department if there are any of these risk factors  NICE's guidelines on shared decision making and decision making and mental capacity):\nunconsciousness or lack of full consciousness (for example, problems keeping eyes open)\nany focal neurological deficit since the injury\nany suspicion of a complex skull fracture or penetrating head injury\nany seizure ('convulsion' or 'fit') since the injury\na high-energy head injury\nthere is no other way of safely transporting the person to the hospital emergency department  recommendation 1.2.. \nRemote advice services (for example, NHS  should refer people who have sustained a head injury to a hospital emergency department if there are any of these risk factors  NICE's guidelines on shared decision making and decision making and mental capacity):\nany loss of consciousness ('knocked out') because of the injury, from which the person has now recovered\namnesia for events before or after the injury ('problems with memory'; it will not be possible to assess amnesia in children who are preverbal and is unlikely to be possible in children under \na persistent headache since the injury\nany vomiting episodes since the injury\nany previous brain surgery\nany history of bleeding or clotting disorders\ncurrent anticoagulant and antiplatelet (except aspirin monotherapy) treatment\ncurrent drug or alcohol intoxication\nany safeguarding concerns (for example, possible non-accidental injury or a vulnerable person is affected)\nirritability or altered behaviour (easily distracted, not themselves, no concentration, no interest in things around them), particularly in babies and children under 5\ncontinuing concern by helpline staff about the diagnosis. \n\n【6】 ## Community health services and inpatient units without an emergency department\nCommunity health services (GPs, ambulance crews, NHS walk-in or minor injury centres, dental practitioners) and inpatient units without an emergency department should refer people who have sustained a head injury to a hospital emergency department, using the ambulance service if necessary, if there are any of these risk factors  NICE's guidelines on shared decision making and decision making and mental capacity):\na Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of less than 15 on initial assessment\nany loss of consciousness because of the injury\nany focal neurological deficit since the injury\nany suspicion of a complex skull fracture or penetrating head injury since the injury\namnesia for events before or after the injury (it will not be possible to assess amnesia in children who are preverbal and is unlikely to be possible in children under \na persistent headache since the injury\nany vomiting episodes since the injury (use clinical judgement about the cause of vomiting in children 12 years or under and the need for referral)\nany seizure since the injury\nany previous brain surgery\na high-energy head injury\nany history of bleeding or clotting disorders\ncurrent anticoagulant and antiplatelet (except aspirin monotherapy) treatment\ncurrent drug or alcohol intoxication\nany safeguarding concerns (for example, possible non-accidental injury or a vulnerable person is affected)\ncontinuing concern by the professional about the diagnosis. \nIn the absence of any risk factors in recommendation 1.2.4, consider referral to an emergency department if any of these factors are present, depending on judgement of severity  NICE's guidelines on shared decision making and decision making and mental capacity):\nirritability or altered behaviour, particularly in babies and children under 5\nvisible trauma to the head not covered in recommendation 1.2.4 but still of concern to the professional\nno one is able to observe the injured person at home\ncontinuing concern by the injured person, or their family or carer, about the diagnosis. \n\n【7】 ## Transport to hospital from community health services and inpatient units without an emergency department\nEnsure people referred from community health services are accompanied by a competent adult during transport to the emergency department. \nThe referring professional should determine if an ambulance is needed, based on the person's clinical condition. If an ambulance is not needed, provided the person is accompanied, public transport or being driven in a car are appropriate means of transport. \nThe referring professional should inform the destination hospital (by phone) of the impending transfer. In non-emergencies, a letter summarising signs and symptoms should be sent with the person. \n\n【8】 ## Training in risk assessment\nTrain GPs, nurse practitioners, dentists and ambulance crews, as necessary, to ensure that they are capable of assessing the presence or absence of the risk factors listed in the section on community health services and inpatient units without an emergency department. \n\n【9】 # Immediate management at the scene and transport to hospital\n\n【10】 ## Glasgow Coma Scale\nBase monitoring and exchange of information about people with a head injury on the 3 separate responses on the GCS (for example, describe a person with a GCS score of 13 based on scores of 4 on eye opening, 4 on verbal response and 5 on motor response as E4, V4, M. \nWhen recording or passing on information about total GCS score, give this as a score out of 15 (for example, 13 out of . \nDescribe the individual components of the GCS in all communications and every patient record and ensure that they always accompany the total score. \nIn the paediatric version of the GCS, include a 'grimace' alternative to the verbal score to enable scoring in children who are preverbal. \nIn some people (for example, people with dementia, underlying chronic neurological disorders or learning disabilities), the pre-injury baseline GCS score may be less than 15. Establish this when possible and take it into account during assessment. \n\n【11】 ## Initial assessment and care\nInitially assess people 16 and over who have sustained a head injury and manage their care according to clear principles and standard practice, as embodied in the:\nAdvanced Trauma Life Support course or European Trauma course\nInternational Trauma Life Support course\nPre-hospital Trauma Life Support course\nAdvanced Trauma Nurse Course\nTrauma Nursing Core Course\nJoint Royal Colleges Ambulance Service Liaison Committee Clinical Practice Guidelines for Head Trauma. \nInitially assess people under 16 who have sustained a head injury and manage their care according to clear principles outlined in the:\nAdvanced Paediatric Life Support course or European Paediatric Life Support course\nPre-hospital Paediatric Life Support course\nPaediatric Education for Pre-hospital Professionals course. \nWhen administering immediate care, first treat the greatest threat to life and avoid further harm. For advice on volume resuscitation for people with a traumatic brain injury and haemorrhagic shock, see NICE's guideline on major trauma: assessment and initial management. \nFor recommendations on when to carry out full in-line spine immobilisation and how long immobilisation is needed if indicated, see NICE's guideline on spinal injury. \nMake pre-alert calls to the destination emergency department for anyone with a GCS score of 8 or less to ensure appropriately experienced professionals are available for their treatment and to prepare for imaging. \nManage pain effectively because it can lead to a rise in intracranial pressure. Provide reassurance, splint limb fractures and catheterise a full bladder when needed. Also see NICE's guideline on major trauma: assessment and initial management. \nAlways follow best practice in paediatric coma observation and recording, as detailed by the National Paediatric Neuroscience Benchmarking Group. \n\n【12】 ## Transport to hospital\nTransport people who have sustained a head injury directly to a major trauma centre or trauma unit that has the age-appropriate resources to further resuscitate them, and to investigate and initially manage multiple injuries. \nFor guidance on the care of people with major trauma, see NICE's guideline on major trauma: service delivery. \nFor a short explanation of why the committee made these recommendations and how they might affect practice or services, see the rationale and impact section on transport to hospital .\nFull details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review B: transport to a distant specialist neuroscience centre.\n\n【13】 ## Training for ambulance crews and paramedics\nAmbulance crews and paramedics should be fully trained in the use of the adult and paediatric versions of the GCS and its derived score. \nAmbulance crews and paramedics should be trained in the safeguarding of people under 16 and people 16 and over who are vulnerable. They should document and verbally inform emergency department staff of any safeguarding concerns. \n\n【14】 ## Tranexamic acid\nFor people with a head injury and a GCS score of 12 or less who are not thought to have active extracranial bleeding, consider:\na 2 g intravenous bolus injection of tranexamic acid for people 16 and over\n NICE's information on prescribing medicines. \nFor people with a head injury, and suspected or confirmed extracranial bleeding, see the recommendations in the section on haemostatic agents in pre-hospital and hospital settings in NICE's guideline on major trauma: assessment and initial management. \nFor a short explanation of why the committee made these recommendations and how they might affect practice or services, see the rationale and impact section on tranexamic acid .\nFull details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review A: tranexamic acid.\n\n【15】 ## Direct access from the community to imaging\nDo not refer people who have had a head injury for neuroimaging by direct access from the community. \nFor a short explanation of why the committee made this recommendation and how it might affect practice or services, see the rationale and impact section on direct access from the community to imaging .\nFull details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review C: direct access from the community to imaging.\n\n【16】 # Assessment in the emergency department\n NICE's guideline on major trauma: assessment and initial management. \nOnly assume a depressed conscious level is due to intoxication after an important traumatic brain injury has been excluded. \nEnsure all emergency department clinicians involved in assessing people with a head injury are capable of assessing the presence or absence of the risk factors for CT head imaging listed in the recommendations on the criteria for doing a CT head scan and the criteria for doing a cervical spine scan in people 16 and over and people under 16. Make training available as needed to ensure this. \nEnsure people presenting to the emergency department with impaired consciousness (a GCS score of less than  are assessed immediately by a trained member of staff. \nFor people with a GCS score of 12 or less, see the recommendations on tranexamic acid. \nFor people with a GCS score of 8 or less, ensure early involvement of an appropriately trained clinician to provide advanced airway management, as described in recommendations 1.8.7 and 1.8.8 in the section on transfer of people 16 and over, and to assist with resuscitation. \nEnsure a trained member of staff assesses anyone presenting to an emergency department with a head injury within a maximum of 15 minutes of arrival at hospital. Part of this assessment should establish whether they are at high or low risk for clinically important traumatic brain or cervical spine injury, as described in the recommendations on the criteria for doing a CT head scan and the criteria for doing a CT cervical spine scan in people 16 and over and people under 16. \nIn people considered to be at high risk for clinically important traumatic brain or cervical spine injury, extend assessment to full clinical examination to establish any need for CT imaging of the head, or imaging of the cervical spine and other body areas. Use the recommendations on the criteria for doing a CT head scan and the criteria for doing a CT cervical spine scan in people 16 and over and people under 16 as the basis for the final decision on imaging after discussion with the radiology department. \nAnyone triaged to be at low risk for clinically important traumatic brain or cervical spine injury at initial assessment should be re-examined by an emergency department clinician. They should establish whether CT imaging of the head or cervical spine will be needed. Use the recommendations on the criteria for doing a CT head scan and the criteria for doing a cervical spine scan in people 16 and over and people under 16 as the basis for the final decision on imaging after discussion with the radiology department. \nReview people who return to an emergency department with any persistent complaint relating to the initial head injury and discuss them with a senior clinician experienced in head injuries. Consider whether a CT scan is needed. \n NICE's guideline on major trauma: assessment and initial management for information on pain management. \n NICE's guidelines on child maltreatment, child abuse and neglect, domestic violence and abuse and safeguarding adults in care homes for clinical features that may be associated with maltreatment. \nFor a short explanation of why the committee made this recommendation and how it might affect practice or services, see the rationale and impact section on assessment in the emergency department .\nFull details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review D: clinical decision rules selecting people with head injury for imaging.\n\n【17】 Involve a clinician with training in safeguarding in the initial assessment of any person with a head injury presenting to the emergency department. If there are any concerns identified, document these and follow local safeguarding procedures appropriate to the person's age. \nUse a standard head injury proforma for documentation when assessing and observing people with a head injury throughout their time in hospital. This form should be of a consistent format across all clinical departments and hospitals in which a person might be treated. Use a separate proforma for people under 16. Include areas to allow extra documentation (for example, in cases of non-accidental injury). \n\n【18】 ## Involving the neurosurgical department\nDiscuss with a neurosurgeon the care of anyone with new and surgically significant abnormalities on imaging. The definition of 'surgically significant' should be developed by local neurosurgical centres and agreed with referring hospitals, along with referral procedures. \nRegardless of imaging, discuss a person's care plan with a neurosurgeon if they have:\npersisting coma (a GCS score of 8 or less) after initial resuscitation\nunexplained confusion that persists for more than 4 hours\ndeterioration in GCS score after admission (pay more attention to motor response deterioration)\nprogressive focal neurological signs\na seizure without full recovery\na definite or suspected penetrating injury\na cerebrospinal fluid leak. \n\n【19】 # Investigating clinically important traumatic brain injuries\nThe current primary investigation of choice for detecting an acute clinically important traumatic brain injury is CT imaging of the head. \nFor safety, logistic and resource reasons, do not do MRI scanning as the primary investigation for clinically important traumatic brain injury in people who have sustained a head injury. But additional information of importance to prognosis can sometimes be detected using MRI. \nEnsure that there is appropriate equipment for monitoring people with a head injury who are having an MRI scan. Also ensure that all staff involved are aware of the dangers and necessary precautions for working near an MRI scanner. \nDo not use plain X‑rays of the skull to diagnose important traumatic brain injury before a discussion with a neuroscience unit. However, people under 16 presenting with suspected non-accidental injury may need a skeletal survey. \nArrange transfer to a suihospital for people with indications for a CT scan who present to a hospital where CT scans are not available  the recommendations on the criteria for doing a CT head scan and the criteria for doing a CT cervical spine scan in people 16 and over and people under . \nTrauma networks should make sure that people can be transferred as indicated in recommendation 1.5.5. \nIn line with good radiation exposure practice, make every effort to minimise radiation dose during imaging of the head and cervical spine, while ensuring that image quality and coverage is sufficient to achieve an adequate diagnostic study. \n\n【20】 ## Criteria for doing a CT head scan\nFor people 16 and over who have sustained a head injury, do a CT head scan within 1 hour of any of these risk factors being identified:\na GCS score of 12 or less on initial assessment in the emergency department\na GCS score of less than 15 at 2 hours after the injury on assessment in the emergency department\nsuspected open or depressed skull fracture\nany sign of basal skull fracture (haemotympanum, 'panda' eyes, cerebrospinal fluid leakage from the ear or nose, Battle's sign)\npost-traumatic seizure\nfocal neurological deficit\nmore than 1 episode of vomiting. \nFor people 16 and over who have had some loss of consciousness or amnesia since the injury, do a CT head scan within 8 hours of the head injury, or within the hour in someone presenting more than 8 hours after the injury, if they have any of these risk factors:\nage 65 or over\nany current bleeding or clotting disorders\ndangerous mechanism of injury (a pedestrian or cyclist struck by a motor vehicle, an occupant ejected from a motor vehicle or a fall from a height of more than 1 m or 5 stairs)\nmore than 30 minutes' retrograde amnesia of events immediately before the head injury. \nFor people under 16 who have sustained a head injury, do a CT head scan within 1 hour of any of these risk factors being identified:\nsuspicion of non-accidental injury\npost-traumatic seizure\n-n initial emergency department assessment, a GCS score of less than 14 or, for babies under 1 year, a GCS score (paediatric) of less than 15\nat 2 hours after the injury, a GCS score of less than 15\nsuspected open or depressed skull fracture, or tense fontanelle\nany sign of basal skull fracture (haemotympanum, 'panda' eyes, cerebrospinal fluid leakage from the ear or nose, Battle's sign)\nfocal neurological deficit\nfor babies under 1 year, a bruise, swelling or laceration of more than 5 cm on the head. \nFor people under 16 who have sustained a head injury and have more than 1 of these risk factors, do a CT head scan within 1 hour of the risk factors being identified:\nloss of consciousness lasting more than 5 minutes (witnessed)\nabnormal drowsiness\n-r more discrete episodes of vomiting\ndangerous mechanism of injury (high-speed road traffic accident as a pedestrian, cyclist or vehicle occupant, fall from a height of more than 3 m, high-speed injury from a projectile or other object)\namnesia (anterograde or retrograde) lasting more than 5 minutes (it will not be possible to assess amnesia in children who are preverbal and is unlikely to be possible in children under \nany current bleeding or clotting disorder. \nObserve people under 16 who have sustained a head injury but have only 1 of the risk factors in recommendation 1.5.11 for a minimum of 4 hours in hospital. If, during observation, any of the following risk factors are identified, do a CT head scan within 1 hour:\na GCS score of less than 15\nfurther vomiting\na further episode of abnormal drowsiness.If none of these risk factors occur during observation, use clinical judgement to determine whether a longer period of observation is needed. \nFor people who have sustained a head injury and have no other indications for a CT head scan, but are on anticoagulant treatment (including vitamin K antagonists, direct-acting oral anticoagulants, heparin and low molecular weight heparins) or antiplatelet treatment (excluding aspirin monotherapy), consider doing a CT head scan:\nwithin 8 hours of the injury (for example, if it is difficult to do a risk assessment or if the person might not return to the emergency department if they have signs of deterioration) or\nwithin the hour if they present more than 8 hours after the injury.For advice on reversing vitamin K antagonists and direct-acting oral anticoagulants for people with traumatic intracranial haemorrhage, see NICE's guideline on blood transfusion and NICE's technology appraisal guidance on andexanet alfa for reversing anticoagulation from apixaban or rivaroxaban. \nMake a provisional written radiology report available within 1 hour of a CT scan. \nFor a short explanation of why the committee made these recommendations and how they might affect practice or services, see the rationale and impact section on criteria for doing a CT head scan .\nFull details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in:\nevidence review D: clinical decision rules selecting people with head injury for imaging\nevidence review E: selecting adults, children and infants with head injury for CT or MRI head scan in sub-groups.\n\n【21】 ## Investigation to predict post-concussion syndrome\nFor information on referring people with possible post-concussion syndrome, see recommendation 1.10.14 in the section on follow up. \nFor a short explanation of why the committee made this recommendation and how it might affect practice or services, see the rationale and impact section on post-concussion syndrome .\nFull details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review F: brain injury biomarkers and/or MRI for predicting post-concussion syndrome.\n\n【22】 # Investigating injuries to the cervical spine\n\n【23】 ## Assessing range of movement in the neck\nBe aware that range of movement in the neck when there is clinical suspicion of a cervical spine injury can only be assessed safely before imaging in people with a head injury if they have no high-risk factors  recommendation 1.6.2, and recommendations 1.6.4 and 1.6.. Only do the assessment if they have at least 1 of these low-risk features:\nthey were in a simple rear-end motor vehicle collision\nthey are comforin a sitting position\nthey have been ambulatory at any time since injury\nthere is no midline cervical spine tenderness\n NICE's guideline on spinal injury: assessment and initial management. \n\n【24】 ## Criteria for doing a CT cervical spine scan in people 16 and over\nFor people 16 and over who have sustained a head injury (including people with delayed presentation), do a CT cervical spine scan within 1 hour of the risk factor being identified if any of these high-risk factors apply:\nthe GCS score is 12 or less on initial assessment\nthe person has been intubated\na definitive diagnosis of a cervical spine injury is urgently needed (for example, if cervical spine manipulation is needed during surgery or anaesthesia)\nthere has been blunt polytrauma involving the head and chest, abdomen or pelvis in someone who is alert and sthere is clinical suspicion of a cervical spine injury and any of these factors:\nage 65 or over\na dangerous mechanism of injury (that is, a fall from a height of more than 1 m or 5 stairs, an axial load to the head such as from diving, a high-speed motor vehicle collision, a rollover motor accident, ejection from a motor vehicle, an accident involving motorised recreational vehicles or a bicycle collision)\nfocal peripheral neurological deficit\nparaesthesia in the upper or lower limbs. \nFor people 16 and over who have sustained a head injury, and have neck pain or tenderness but no high-risk indications for a CT cervical spine scan  recommendation 1.6., do a CT cervical spine scan within 1 hour for any of these risk factors:\nit is not thought to be safe to assess the range of movement in the neck  recommendation 1.6.\nsafe assessment of range of neck movement shows that the person cannot actively rotate their neck 45 degrees to the left and right\nthe person has a condition predisposing them to a higher risk of injury to the cervical spine (for example, axial spondyloarthritis). \n\n【25】 ## Criteria for doing a CT cervical spine scan in people under 16\nFor people under 16 who have sustained a head injury (including those with delayed presentation), only do a CT cervical spine scan if any of these risk factors apply:\nthe GCS score is 12 or less on initial assessment\nthe person has been intubated\nthere are focal peripheral neurological signs\nthere is paraesthesia in the upper or lower limbs\na definitive diagnosis of a cervical spine injury is needed urgently (for example, if manipulation of the cervical spine is needed during surgery or anaesthesia)\nthe person is having other body areas scanned for head injury or multisystem trauma, and there is clinical suspicion of a cervical spine injury\nthere is strong clinical suspicion of injury despite normal X‑rays\nplain X‑rays are technically difficult or inadequate\nplain X‑rays identify a significant bony injury.Do the scan within 1 hour of the risk factor being identified. \nFor people under 16 who have sustained a head injury, and have neck pain or tenderness but no indications for a CT cervical spine scan  recommendation 1.6., do 3‑view cervical spine X‑rays before assessing range of movement in the neck if any of these risk factors are identified:\nthere was a dangerous mechanism of injury (that is, a fall from a height of more than 1 m or 5 stairs, an axial load to the head such as from diving, a high-speed motor vehicle collision, a rollover motor accident, ejection from a motor vehicle, an accident involving motorised recreational vehicles or a bicycle collision)\nsafe assessment of range of movement in the neck is not possible  recommendation 1.6.\nthe person has a condition that predisposes them to a higher risk of injury to the cervical spine (for example, collagen vascular disease, osteogenesis imperfecta, axial spondyloarthritis).The X‑rays should be done within 1 hour of the risk factor being identified and reviewed by a clinician trained in their interpretation. \nIf range of neck movement can be assessed safely  recommendation 1.6. in a person under 16 who has sustained a head injury, and has neck pain or tenderness but no indications for a CT cervical spine scan, do 3‑view cervical spine X‑rays if they cannot actively rotate their neck 45 degrees to the left and right. When the person is unable to understand commands or open their mouth, a peg view may be omitted. The X‑rays should be done within 1 hour of this risk factor being identified, and reviewed by a clinician trained in their interpretation. \n\n【26】 ## Timing of radiology report\nMake a provisional written radiology report available within 1 hour of a CT scan. \n\n【27】 ## Imaging investigations\nEnsure that imaging reports are based on high-resolution source data and multiplanar reformatting of the entire cervical spine. \nDo MRI in addition to CT if there are neurological signs and symptoms suggesting injury to the cervical spine. \nDo CT or MRI angiography of the neck vessels if there is a suspicion of vascular injury, for example, because of:\nvertebral malalignment\na high-risk fracture (that is, a high-grade or complex facial fracture or a base of skull fracture likely to involve the internal carotid artery or vertebral artery)\nposterior circulation syndrome. \nConsider MRI for assessing ligamentous and disc injuries suggested by CT or clinical findings. \nFor a short explanation of why the committee made these recommendations and how they might affect practices or services, see the rationale and impact section on investigating injuries to the cervical spine .\nFull details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review H: CT, MRI and X-ray of the cervical spine in people with head injury – diagnostic.\n\n【28】 # Information and support for families and carers\nStaff caring for people with a head injury should introduce themselves to family members or carers, and briefly explain what they are doing. \nEnsure that information for families and carers explains the nature of the head injury and the likely care pathway. \nStaff should think about how best to share information with people under 16, and introduce them to the possibility of long-term complex changes in their parent or sibling who has had a head injury. Literature produced by patient support groups may be helpful. \nEncourage family members and carers to talk to and make physical contact (for example, holding hands) with the person with a head injury. But ensure that relatives and friends do not feel obliged to spend long periods at the bedside. If they wish to stay with the person with a head injury, encourage them to take regular breaks. \nEnsure there is a board or area displaying leaflets or contact details for local and national patient support organisations to help family members and carers gather further information. \n\n【29】 # Transfer from hospital to a neuroscience unit\n\n【30】 ## Transfer of people 16 and over\nEnsure local guidelines on the transfer of people with a severe traumatic brain injury are drawn up between the referring hospital trusts, the neuroscience unit and the local ambulance service, and recognise that:\ntransfer would benefit anyone with serious head injuries (a GCS score of 8 or less), irrespective of the need for neurosurgery\nif transfer of people who do not need neurosurgery is not possible, ongoing liaison with the neuroscience unit over clinical management is essential. Also see the recommendations on transfer between emergency departments in NICE's guideline on major trauma: service delivery. \nThink about the possibility of occult extracranial injuries in people 16 and over with multiple injuries, and do not transfer them to a service that is unable to deal with other aspects of trauma. \nEnsure there is a designated consultant in the referring hospital with responsibility for establishing arrangements for the transfer of people with head injuries to a neuroscience unit. Also ensure there is another consultant at the neuroscience unit with responsibility for establishing arrangements for communication with referring hospitals, and for receiving people transferred. \nEnsure that people with traumatic brain injuries needing emergency transfer to a neuroscience unit are accompanied by healthcare staff with appropriate training and experience in the transfer of people with an acute traumatic brain injury. They should:\nbe familiar with the pathophysiology of traumatic brain injuries, the medicines and equipment they will use, and working in the confines of an ambulance (or helicopter if appropriate)\nhave a dedicated and adequately trained assistant\nbe provided with appropriate clothing for the transfer, medical indemnity and personal accident insurance.Ensure that people needing non-emergency transfer are accompanied by appropriate clinical staff. \nProvide the transfer team responsible for transferring a person with a head injury with a means of communicating changes in the person's status with their base hospital and the neurosurgical unit during the transfer. \nAlthough it is understood that transfer is often urgent, complete the initial resuscitation and stabilisation of the person, and establish comprehensive monitoring before transfer, to avoid complications during the journey. Do not transport someone with persistent hypotension, despite resuscitation, until the cause has been identified and they are stabilised. \nIntubate and ventilate anyone with a GCS score of 8 or less needing transfer to a neuroscience unit, and anyone with the indications detailed in recommendation 1.8.8. \nIntubate and ventilate the person immediately when there is:\ncoma, that is, they are not obeying commands, not speaking and not eye opening (a GCS score of 8 or less)\nloss of protective laryngeal reflexes\nventilatory insufficiency, as judged by blood gases: hypoxaemia (PaO2 less than 13 kPa on oxygen) or hypercarbia (PaCO2 more than 6 kPa)\nirregular respirations. \nUse intubation and ventilation before the start of the journey when the person has:\nsignificantly deteriorating conscious level (1 or more points on the motor score), even if not coma\nunsfractures of the facial skeleton\ncopious bleeding into the mouth (for example, from a skull base fracture)\nseizures. \nAnyone whose trachea is intubated should have appropriate sedation and analgesia along with a neuromuscular blocking drug. Aim for a PaO2 of more than 13 kPa, and a PaCO2 of 4.5 kPa to 5.0 kPa, unless there is clinical or radiological evidence of raised intracranial pressure, in which case more aggressive hyperventilation is justified. If hyperventilation is used, increase the inspired oxygen concentration. Maintain the mean arterial pressure at 80 mmHg or more by infusion of fluid and vasopressors, as indicated. \nGive family members and carers as much access to the person with a head injury as is practical during transfer. If possible, give them an opportunity to discuss the reasons for transfer and how the transfer process works with a member of the healthcare team. \n\n【31】 ## Transfer of people under 16\nRecommendations 1.8.1 to 1.8.9 and 1.8.11 were written for people 16 and over, but apply these principles to people under 16, providing that the paediatric modification of the GCS is used for preverbal and non-verbal children. Ventilate people under 16 according to the age-appropriate level of oxygen saturation and maintain blood pressure at a level appropriate for their age. \nEnsure that service provision for transfer to tertiary care follows the principles outlined in the NHS England service specification for paediatric intensive care retrieval (transport) and the Paediatric Critical Care Society quality standards for the care of critically ill or injured children. \nThink about the possibility of occult extracranial injuries for people under 16 with multiple injuries. Do not transfer them to a service that is unable to deal with other aspects of trauma. \nEnsure that transfer of people under 16 to a specialist neurosurgical unit is done either by staff experienced in the transfer of people under 16 who are critically ill or according to local guidelines with specialist paediatric retrieval teams. \nGive family members and carers as much access to their child as is practical during transfer. If possible, give them an opportunity to discuss the reasons for transfer and how the transfer process works with a member of the healthcare team. \n\n【32】 # Admission and observation\nUse these criteria for admitting people to hospital after a head injury:\nnew, clinically important abnormalities on imaging (an isolated simple linear non-displaced skull fracture is unlikely to be a clinically important abnormality unless they are taking anticoagulant or antiplatelet medication)\nafter imaging, a GCS score that has not returned to 15 or their pre-injury baseline, regardless of the imaging results\nwhen there are indications for CT scanning but this cannot be done within the appropriate time period, either because CT is not available or because the person is not sufficiently cooperative to allow scanning\ncontinuing worrying symptoms (for example, persistent vomiting, severe headaches or seizures) of concern to the clinician\n the section on discharge and follow up for recommendations about other factors to consider, such as whether supervision at home is available. \nBe aware that some people may need an extended period in a recovery setting because of having general anaesthesia during CT imaging. \nAdmit people with multiple injuries under the care of the team that is trained to deal with their most severe and urgent problem. \nWhen someone with a head injury needs hospital admission, admit them under the care of a team led by a consultant who has been trained in managing this condition. The consultant and their team should have competence (defined by local agreement with the neuroscience unit) in:\nassessment, observation and indications for imaging  the sections on the criteria for doing a CT head scan and the criteria for doing a CT cervical spine scan in people 16 and over and people under \ninpatient management\nindications for transfer to a neuroscience unit  the section on transfer from hospital to a neuroscience unit)\nhospital discharge and follow up  the section on discharge and follow up). \n\n【33】 ## Admission and observation of people with concussion symptoms\nFor people with concussion symptoms after normal brain imaging or no indication for early imaging, follow the indications for admission in recommendation 1.9.1. Also see the section on discharge advice. \nFor a short explanation of why the committee made these recommendations and how they might affect practice or services, see the rationale and impact section on admission and observation .\nFull details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in:\nevidence review I: admission and observation in hospital of people with head injury who are on anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy after normal brain imaging or no indication for early imaging\nevidence review J: admission and observation of people with concussion symptoms\nevidence review K: hospital admission in people with small intracranial injuries\nevidence review L: isolated skull fracture.\n\n【34】 ## Early diagnosis of hypopituitarism\nBe aware that any severity of head injury can cause pituitary dysfunction. This may present immediately, hours, weeks or months after the injury. A variety of symptoms could indicate hypopituitarism. \nIn people admitted to hospital with a head injury who have persistently abnormal low sodium levels or low blood pressure, consider investigations for hypopituitarism. \nIn people presenting to primary or community care with persistent symptoms consistent with hypopituitarism in the weeks or months after a head injury, consider investigations or referral for hypopituitarism. \nFor a short explanation of why the committee made these recommendations and how they might affect practice or services, see the rationale and impact section on early diagnosis of hypopituitarism .\nFull details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in:\nevidence review M: identification of hypopituitarism (who to investigate)\nevidence review N: identification of hypopituitarism (when to investigate).\n\n【35】 ## Observation of people who are admitted\nEnsure that in-hospital observation of people with a head injury is only done by professionals competent in assessing head injuries. \nFor people admitted for head injury observation, the minimum accepdocumented neurological observations are: GCS score, pupil size and reactivity, limb movements, respiratory rate, heart rate, blood pressure, temperature and blood oxygen saturation. \nCarry out and record observations on a half-hourly basis until there is a GCS score of 15. Observations for people with a GCS score of 15 should start after the initial assessment in the emergency department and the minimum frequency should be:\nhalf-hourly for 2 hours, then\nhourly for 4 hours, then\nhourly. \nRevert to half-hourly observations and follow the original frequency schedule for people with a GCS score of 15 who deteriorate at any time after the initial 2‑hour period. \nUrgently reassess a person with a head injury if they have any of these signs of neurological deterioration:\nagitation or abnormal behaviour\na sustained (that is, for at least 30 minutes) drop of 1 point in GCS score (give more weight to a drop of 1 point in the motor response score of the GCS score)\nany drop of 3 or more points in the eye opening or verbal response scores of the GCS score, or 2 or more points in the motor response score\nsevere or increasing headache, or persistent vomiting\nnew or evolving neurological symptoms or signs such as pupil inequality or asymmetry of limb or facial movement.A supervising doctor should do the appraisal. \nTo reduce interobserver variability and unnecessary referrals, get a second member of staff competent in observations to confirm deterioration before involving the supervising doctor. Do this immediately if possible. If not possible (for example, because no staff member is available to do the second observation), contact the supervising doctor without the confirmation being done. \nIf any of the changes noted in recommendation 1.9.13 are confirmed, consider doing an immediate CT scan, and reassess the person's clinical condition and manage appropriately. \nIf a person has had a normal CT scan but does not have a GCS score of 15 after 24 hours of observation, consider a further CT or MRI scan and discuss with the radiology department. \n\n【36】 ## Observation of babies and children under 5\nBe aware that observation of babies and children under 5 is difficult, so should only be done by units with staff experienced in the observation of under 5s with a head injury. Babies and children under 5 may be observed in normal paediatric observation settings, as long as staff have the appropriate experience. \n\n【37】 ## Training in observation\nAll staff caring for people with a head injury admitted for observation should be trained in doing the observations listed in recommendations 1.9.10 to 1.9.14 in the section on observation of people who are admitted, and the recommendation on observation of babies and children under 5. \nMake dedicated training available to all relevant staff to enable them to acquire and maintain observation and recording skills. Specific training is needed for the observation of people under 16. \n\n【38】 # Discharge and follow up\nIf CT is not indicated based on history and examination and there is no suspicion of clinically important traumatic brain injury, discharge the person from hospital if there are:\nno other factors that would warrant a hospital admission (for example, drug or alcohol intoxication, other injuries, shock, suspected non-accidental injury, meningism, or cerebrospinal fluid leak)\nappropriate support structures for safe discharge to the community and for subsequent care (for example, competent supervision at home). \nIf imaging of the head is normal and the risk of clinically important traumatic brain injury is low, transfer the person to the community if:\nthe GCS score has returned to 15 or the pre-injury baseline GCS score\nthere are no other factors that would warrant a hospital admission (for example, drug or alcohol intoxication, other injuries, shock, suspected non-accidental injury, meningism, or cerebrospinal fluid leak)\nthere are appropriate support structures for safe transfer to the community and for subsequent care (for example, competent supervision at home). \nAfter normal imaging of the cervical spine, risk of injury to the cervical spine is low enough to warrant transfer to the community if:\nthe GCS score is 15\nclinical examination is normal\nthere are no other factors that would warrant a hospital admission present (for example, drug or alcohol intoxication, other injuries, shock, suspected non-accidental injury, meningism, or cerebrospinal fluid leak)\nthere are appropriate support structures for safe transfer to the community and for subsequent care (for example, competent supervision at home). \nDo not discharge people presenting with a head injury until their GCS score is 15 or, in preverbal and non-verbal children, consciousness is normal as assessed by the paediatric version of the GCS. In people with pre-injury cognitive impairment, their GCS score should be back to that documented before the injury. \nOnly transfer people with any degree of head injury to their home if there is somebody suiat home to supervise them. Discharge people with no carer at home only if suisupervision arrangements have been organised, or when the risk of late complications is thought to be negligible. \n\n【39】 ## People with pre-injury cognitive impairment\nEnsure that people with pre-injury cognitive impairment (for example, dementia or a learning disability) and people returning to a custodial setting are supervised and monitored. Also, make sure that arrangements are in place should there be any signs of deterioration. \nFor a short explanation of why the committee made this recommendation and how it might affect practice or services, see the rationale and impact section on discharge and follow up .\nFull details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review E: selecting adults, children and infants with head injury for CT or MRI head scan in sub-groups.\n\n【40】 ## Discharge after observation\nPeople admitted after a head injury may be discharged after resolution of all significant symptoms and signs, provided they have suisupervision arrangements at home, in custody or in continued care. \n\n【41】 ## Discharge advice\n be provided to the person responsible for their care after discharge. This may include their families, carers, social workers or custodial staff. Follow the recommendations in NICE's guidelines on patient experience in adult NHS services and babies, children and young people's experience of healthcare, including on providing information in an accessible format. \nEnsure that printed advice for people with a head injury, and their families and carers, is age appropriate and includes:\ndetails of the nature and severity of the injury\nrisk factors that mean people need to return to the emergency department  the recommendations on community health services and inpatient units without an emergency department)\na specification that a responsible adult should stay with the person for the first 24 hours after their injury\ndetails about the recovery process, including the fact that some people may appear to make a quick recovery but later have difficulties or complications\ncontact details of community and hospital services in case of delayed complications\ninformation about return to everyday activities, including school, work, sports and driving\ndetails of support organisations. \nOffer information and advice on alcohol or drug misuse to people who presented to the emergency department with drug or alcohol intoxication when they are fit for discharge. \nInform people with a head injury, and their families and carers, about the possibility of persistent or delayed symptoms after a head injury and who to contact if they have ongoing problems. \nFor anyone who has attended the emergency department with a head injury, write to their GP within 48 hours of discharge, giving details of clinical history and examination. Also share this letter with health visitors (for preschool children) and school nurses (for school-age children and young people). If appropriate, provide a copy of the letter for the person with a head injury, and their family or carers, custodial staff or social worker. \n\n【42】 ## Follow up\nRefer people with a head injury to investigate its causes and manage contributing factors, if appropriate. This could include, for example, referral for a falls assessment or to safeguarding services. \nConsider referring people who have persisting problems to a clinician trained in assessing and managing the consequences of traumatic brain injury (for example, a neurologist, neuropsychologist, clinical psychologist, neurosurgeon or endocrinologist, or a multidisciplinary neurorehabilitation team). \nFor a short explanation of why the committee made these recommendations and how they might affect practice or services, see the rationale and impact section on follow up .\nFull details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in:\nevidence review J: admission and observation of people with concussion symptoms\nevidence review N: identification of hypopituitarism (when to investigate).\n\n【43】 ## Investigations for hypopituitarism\nConsider further endocrinology investigations for people who have been discharged after a head injury if they have persistent symptoms consistent with hypopituitarism or are not recovering as expected. \nFor a short explanation of why the committee made this recommendation and how it might affect practice or services, see the rationale and impact section on investigations for hypopituitarism .\nFull details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in:\nevidence review M: identification of hypopituitarism (who to investigate)\nevidence review N: identification of hypopituitarism (when to investigate).\n\n【44】 # Terms used in this guideline\nThis section defines terms that have been used in a particular way for this guideline.\n\n【45】 ## Complex skull fracture or penetrating head injury\nSigns of a basal, open or depressed skull fracture or penetrating head injury inclu\nclear fluid running from the ears or nose\na black eye with no associated damage around the eyes\nbleeding from 1 or both ears\nbruising behind 1 or both ears\npenetrating injury signs\nvisible trauma to the scalp or skull of concern to the professional.\n\n【46】 ## Focal neurological deficit\nNeurological problems restricted to a particular part of the body or a particular activity, for example:\ndifficulties with understanding, speaking, reading or writing\ndecreased sensation\nloss of balance\nweakness\nvisual changes\nnystagmus\nabnormal reflexes\nproblems walking\namnesia since the injury.\n\n【47】 ## Glasgow Coma Scale\nIn people with a head injury, the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is an early assessment of the severity of any associated traumatic brain injury. It is a standardised system used to assess the degree of brain impairment and to identify the seriousness of injury in relation to outcome. The scale has 3 domains: eye opening, verbal and motor responses. These are all evaluated independently in the scale according to a numerical value that indicates the level of consciousness and degree of dysfunction. The scores in each element of the GCS are summed to give the overall GCS score, which ranges from 3 (unresponsive in all domains) to 15 (no deficits in responsiveness):\nMild traumatic brain injury is a GCS score of 13 to 15.\nModerate traumatic brain injury is a GCS score of 9 to 12.\nSevere traumatic brain injury is a GCS score of 8 or less.\n\n【48】 ## High-energy head injury\nAn injury arising from, for example, a pedestrian being struck by a motor vehicle, an occupant being ejected from a motor vehicle, a fall from a height of more than 1 m or more than 5 stairs, a diving accident, a high-speed motor vehicle collision, a rollover motor accident, an accident involving motorised recreational vehicles, a bicycle collision or any other potentially high-energy mechanism.\n\n【49】 ## Hypopituitarism\nUnderactivity of the pituitary gland that can lead to:\nadrenocorticotropic hormone deficiency causing weakness, fatigue, weight loss, hypotension, hyponatraemia, hypoglycaemia, hypercalcaemia, anaemia and fatigue\ngrowth hormone deficiency causing decreased energy, low mood, neuropsychiatric and cognitive symptoms, decreased lean body mass, increased fat mass, altered metabolic profile and decreased exercise capacity\nlack of sex hormones that can cause later puberty, hot flushes, fatigue, tiredness, loss of body hair, reduced sex drive, irregular periods, erectile dysfunction and reduced fertility\nthyroid-stimulating hormone deficiency presenting with slow growth, fatigue, lethargy, cold intolerance and weight gain\nvasopressin deficiency causing polyuria, polydipsia, nocturia and incontinence.\n\n【50】 ## Isolated simple linear non-displaced skull fracture\nA single or solitary linear fracture that does not exhibit any inward or outward displacement, does not consist of multiple fracture lines and does not involve or cross the normal sutures of the skull.\n\n【51】 ## Paraesthesia\nPins and needles, or a prickling sensation, tingling or itching in any part of the body.\n\n【52】 ## Post-concussion syndrome\nPost-concussion syndrome (or post-concussion symptoms) is seen in all severities of head injury and is under-recognised in mild head injuries. It is the term used in evidence review F: brain injury biomarkers and/or MRI for predicting post-concussion syndrome. The term 'concussion' is used in evidence review J: admission and observation of people with concussion symptoms.\nExamples of symptoms in these reviews include, but are not limited to:\nSensory and motor:\nheadache\ndizziness\nnausea\nchanges in vision, such as blurred vision, double vision, 'seeing stars' and 'looking through a haze'\nvisual processing problems, such as not taking in what you are seeing\ndifficulties staying awake, sleeping for many more hours than usual and chronic fatigue when awake\nunusual sensitivity to noise (hyperacusis)\nunusual sensitivity to bright lights (photophobia)\ndifficulties with balance, coordination and mobility, often resulting in falls, banging into objects and, at times, further traumatic brain injuries\nspeech problems.\nCognition:\ncognitive difficulties (as long as the GCS score is , sometimes described as 'brain fog', which may include problems finding words or numbers, difficulty speaking, slowed responsiveness, short-term memory problems, difficulty concentrating and problems with information processing, such as following conversations, digesting text and finding words\ndifficulties with executive functions, such as organising, planning and multitasking\namnesia\nproblems with spatial awareness and proprioception, including the sensation of touching something as if through a layer of numbness.\nEmotional:\nlability, such as unusual laughing or crying (because of being overwhelmed by sense impressions) or irritability\ndepression\nanxiety.\nAdditional symptoms that may present in children under 5:\nchanges in normal behaviour after a head injury, such as crying a lot or irritability\nchanges in feeding or sleeping habits\nloss of interest in people or objects\nlistlessness.\n\n【53】 ## Traumatic brain injury\nAn alteration in brain function, or other evidence of brain pathology, caused by an external force.# Recommendations for research\nThe guideline committee has made these recommendations for research.\n\n【54】 # Key recommendations for research\n\n【55】 ## Indications for admission in people with a mild head injury and a confirmed abnormality on a CT scan\nWhat are the indications for admission using clinical decision rules in people with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 13 to 15 (a mild head injury) and a confirmed abnormality on a CT scan? \nFor a short explanation of why the committee made this recommendation for research, see the rationale section on admission and observation .\nFull details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review K: hospital admission in people with small intracranial injuries.\n\n【56】 ## Using biomarkers for predicting acute post-traumatic brain injury complications\nWhat is the diagnostic accuracy of brain injury biomarkers for predicting acute complications after a traumatic brain injury? \nFor a short explanation of why the committee made this recommendation for research, see the rationale section on post-concussion syndrome .\nFull details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review G: brain injury biomarkers for predicting acute post-brain injury complications.\n\n【57】 ## Indications for imaging for people with a history of recurrent head injuries\nWhat is the risk of intracranial injuries in people with a history of recurrent head injuries, including from sports and falls, and no other indications for a CT scan? \nFor a short explanation of why the committee made this recommendation for research, see the rationale section on criteria for doing a CT head scan .\nFull details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review E: selecting adults, children and infants with head injury for CT or MRI head scan in sub-groups.\n\n【58】 ## Risk of bleeding for people with a pre-injury coagulopathy\nWhat is the risk of any intracranial bleeding or intracranial bleeding associated with clinical deterioration after head injury in people with a pre-injury coagulopathy? This includes medical conditions such as liver failure or haemophilia, or taking anticoagulants or antiplatelets in people who:\nhave a GCS score of 15 at 2 hours after the head injury and medium risk factors for intracranial bleeding or\nloss of consciousness or amnesia with no additional risk factors (that is, they are under 65, had a low-energy transfer injury and any retrograde amnesia has lasted for less than 30 minutes) or\nthere is no loss of consciousness or amnesia \nFor a short explanation of why the committee made this recommendation for research, see the rationale section on criteria for doing a CT head scan .\nFull details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review E: selecting adults, children and infants with head injury for CT or MRI head scan in sub-groups.\n\n【59】 ## Indications for imaging for people with a pre-injury cognitive impairment\nWhat are the indications for selecting imaging in adults, young people, children and babies with a head injury sustained through a low-energy fall and with suspected pre-injury cognitive impairment when loss of consciousness or amnesia is difficult to assess or the pre-injury GCS score is not 15? \nFor a short explanation of why the committee made this recommendation for research, see the rationale section on criteria for doing a CT head scan .\nFull details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review E: selecting adults, children and infants with head injury for CT or MRI head scan in sub-groups.\n\n【60】 # Other recommendations for research\n\n【61】 ## Transport to a neuroscience centre\nWhat is the clinical and cost effectiveness of pre-hospital strategies to take people with a head injury to a distant specialist neuroscience centre instead of a closer non-specialist unit? \nFor a short explanation of why the committee made this recommendation for research, see the rationale section on transport to hospital .\nFull details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review B: transfer to a distant specialist neuroscience centre.\n\n【62】 ## Tranexamic acid\nWhat is the clinical and cost effectiveness of tranexamic acid before imaging in people presenting within 2 hours of a head injury with a GCS score of 13 to 15 and high-risk indications for intracranial bleeding? \nFor a short explanation of why the committee made this recommendation for research, see the rationale section on tranexamic acid .\nFull details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review A: tranexamic acid.\n\n【63】 ## Indications for selecting people for imaging when they present more than 24 hours after a head injury\nWhat are the indications for selecting people of any age who present more than 24 hours after a head injury for a CT or MRI head scan? \nFor a short explanation of why the committee made this recommendation for research, see the rationale section on criteria for doing a CT head scan .\nFull details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review E: selecting adults, children and infants with head injury for CT or MRI head scan in sub-groups.\n\n【64】 ## Using biomarkers and MRI for predicting post-concussion syndrome\nWhat is the prognostic accuracy of brain injury biomarkers or MRI for predicting post-concussion syndrome? \nFor a short explanation of why the committee made this recommendation for research, see the rationale section on post-concussion syndrome .\nFull details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review F: brain injury biomarkers and/or MRI for predicting post-concussion syndrome.\n\n【65】 ## Timing of testing for hypopituitarism\nWhen should people with a head injury be investigated for hypopituitarism? \nFor a short explanation of why the committee made this recommendation for research, see the rationale section on early diagnosis of hypopituitarism .\nFull details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review N: identification of hypopituitarism (when to investigate).\n# Rationale and impact\nThese sections briefly explain why the committee made the recommendations and how they might affect practice or services.\n\n【66】 # Decision making and mental capacity\nRecommendations 1.1.1 and 1.1.2\n\n【67】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\n highlighted the importance of making decisions for people who may lack capacity now or in the future, and to follow any advance care plans.\n\n【68】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice or services\nThere is not expected to be any change to practice or services.\nReturn to recommendations\n\n【69】 # Transport to hospital\nRecommendations 1.3.13 and 1.3.14\n\n【70】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nEvidence from 1 randomised controlled trial (RCT) and 1 retrospective cohort study was identified. This compared transport for a head injury to a specialist neuroscience centre with transport to the nearest non-specialist acute hospital or general hospital emergency department. All the evidence was in people 16 and over. No evidence was available for people under 16.\nThe evidence from the RCT suggested some benefit for transfer to a non-specialist general hospital for the outcome of mortality, but this was uncertain. The evidence from the retrospective cohort study suggested that there was no difference between the 2 groups for the outcome of survival benefit. The committee agreed that there was limited evidence of a possible benefit for transfer to a specialist neuroscience centre for some outcomes but that this was uncertain. They agreed that there was no compelling evidence to change practice, and to cross refer to NICE's guideline on major trauma: service delivery.\nThe committee noted that the data collection for the RCT was in 2012. This was when trauma care was reorganised in the UK to enable rapid and safe transfer of people to major trauma centres. So, the evidence does not reflect the recent trauma care system, which includes more consultants, quicker CT scans and rehabilitation. So, the committee agreed that further research should be done in this area to determine the effectiveness of transport to specialist neuroscience centres in people with a head injury. They developed a recommendation for research on transport to a neuroscience centre.\n\n【71】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice or services\nThere is not expected to be any change.\nReturn to recommendations\n\n【72】 # Tranexamic acid\nRecommendations 1.3.17 and 1.3.18\n\n【73】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThere was evidence from 2 RCTs for tranexamic acid, both of which included adults with no suspicion of extracranial bleeding. One trial was in a pre-hospital (out-of-hospital) setting and the other was in a hospital setting. There was no evidence available for people under 16 (1 trial included a few people aged 15 and .\nIn the pre-hospital setting, a single 2 g bolus dose of tranexamic acid was given within 2 hours of a head injury. The evidence suggested that it reduced all-cause mortality at 28 days and 6 months in people with moderate or severe traumatic brain injury. But there was no clinically important difference between tranexamic acid and placebo for hospital-free days at 28 days, degree of disability at discharge and after 6 months (Glasgow Outcome Scale–Extended more than , and serious adverse events (that is, myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis and stroke).\nIn the hospital setting, a 1 g bolus dose of tranexamic acid was given within 3 hours of injury, followed by an 8‑hour intravenous infusion of 1 g of tranexamic acid. The evidence suggested that this reduced death from traumatic brain injury at 28 days in groups with mild or moderate traumatic brain injury. Evidence suggested reduced mortality related to severe traumatic brain injury at 28 days in high-income countries, but there was no difference in mortality related to traumatic brain injury in low- and middle-income countries. No evidence was available separating the mild from moderate severity groups for mortality related to traumatic brain injury and all-cause mortality, but communication with the study authors suggested significant uncertainty about tranexamic acid's effect in mild traumatic brain injury. There was no clinically important difference between tranexamic acid and placebo for serious adverse events (that is, myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis and stroke) and disability rating scale scores in a mixed severity group (mild, moderate and severe) across all income groups.\n considered that the evidence showed that it caused very few adverse events. Based on the evidence, they agreed that a 2 g intravenous bolus dose of tranexamic acid, given within 2 hours of a head injury and before imaging, could be considered for people 16 and over with moderate or severe traumatic brain injury. The committee recommended a 2 g intravenous bolus injection of tranexamic acid because this dose was found to be the most safe and effective.\nAn economic model was developed that looked at each traumatic brain injury severity subgroup separately. It was based primarily on the pre-hospital clinical trial because:\nthat provided data for moderate traumatic brain injury separately from that for mild injury\nthe benefits of tranexamic acid were found to be greater when it was given earlier.\nFor moderate traumatic brain injury, the health benefits associated with a 2 g bolus given in the pre-hospital setting outweighed the costs in all scenarios. For severe traumatic brain injury, the cost-effectiveness estimate was more borderline. But, when limitations in the modelling were taken into account, the committee concluded that the health benefits were likely to outweigh the costs in this group too.\nBecause of a lack of trial evidence for tranexamic use in people under 16, the committee used extrapolated evidence from the trials in adults, and their expertise and knowledge. In NHS clinical practice, a tranexamic acid dose of 15 mg/kg is used in people under 16 with extracranial injuries. But, in this age group, tranexamic acid is not currently widely used for isolated head injury and dosing is variable (15 mg/kg to 30 mg/kg). Evidence for people 16 and over with a head injury from a pre-hospital setting suggested that a 2 g dose of tranexamic acid reduced all-cause mortality (at 28 days and 6 months), with no evidence of negative effects. So, the committee concluded that it could recommend the equivalent of a 2 g dose of tranexamic acid for people under 16. They discussed that, based on the average weight of people 16 and over being 70 kg, a 2 g dose of tranexamic acid for people 16 and over would equate to a 30 mg/kg dose for people under 16. So, they concluded that a dose range of 15 mg/kg to 30 mg/kg was appropriate for people under 16.\nFor people with mild traumatic brain injury, it is less clear whether the benefits of tranexamic acid outweigh the potential risk of blood clots. So, the committee made a recommendation for research on tranexamic acid for this group.\n\n【74】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice or services\nTranexamic acid is already used for people who have a head injury and other major trauma. NICE has not previously recommended it for people with an isolated head injury. It is expected that doing so will increase tranexamic acid use by paramedics. This should lead to improved survival for people with a head injury. More resources might be needed for treatment, rehabilitation and care for the people who would not have survived without tranexamic acid.\nReturn to recommendations\n\n【75】 # Direct access from the community to imaging\nRecommendation 1.3.19\n\n【76】 ## Why the committee made the recommendation\nNo evidence was identified for direct access from the community for CT scans or MRI of the head compared with usual care for a suspected or confirmed head injury (including people with delayed presentation, and people in residential and care homes). The committee discussed that imaging ordered in the community setting is mainly used to exclude intracranial bleeding or provide reassurance. They noted that the timing of imaging depends on whether there is an acute injury or the person has post-concussion syndrome. Based on their experience, the committee agreed that people should go to hospital if:\nthere has been important traumatic brain injury within 24 hours or\nthere is a reduced Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score.\n noted the challenges faced in primary care and general practice in interpreting complex neuroradiology reports. The committee therefore agreed that people should not be referred to imaging directly from the community.\n\n【77】 ## How the recommendation might affect practice or services\nThis is expected to be a change in practice for a few centres that will now have to send people for imaging by the emergency department route.\nReturn to recommendation\n\n【78】 # Assessment in the emergency department\nRecommendation 1.4.12\n\n【79】 ## Why the committee made the recommendation\nThe committee highlighted the need to follow relevant guidance if abuse or other safeguarding issues may be factors in a head injury.\n\n【80】 ## How the recommendation might affect practice or services\nThere is not expected to be any change to practice or services.\nReturn to recommendation\n\n【81】 # Criteria for doing a CT head scan\nRecommendations 1.5.8 to 1.5.14\n\n【82】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nSeveral diagnostic accuracy studies were identified but there were no diagnostic RCTs. Most of the evidence was of low to very low quality and was in people with a mild head injury (defined as a GCS score of 13 to 15 in many studies, but sometimes limited to a GCS score of 14 to . The committee noted that the existing recommendations for clinical decision rules for head imaging in people 16 and over were largely based on the Canadian CT Head Rule (CCHR). This involves identifying high and medium risk factors, with some modifications aimed at improving sensitivity. Updated evidence for this decision rule showed that it has good sensitivity when used as intended but that its specificity values are poor. The committee noted that specificity values of decision rules are often low because they prioritise very high sensitivity.\nEvidence identified for other decision rules showed sensitivity values similar to those of the CCHR. However, specificity values were lower compared with the CCHR high and medium risk rule. Limited evidence showed that the NEXUS 2 decision rule has specificity values similar to those of the CCHR.\n agreed that, in their clinical experience, the sensitivity of the NICE recommendations was not as low as suggested in this study.\nThe committee agreed that there was insufficient evidence to support changing the clinical decision rule recommendations for head imaging in people 16 and over. Because the NICE recommendations were largely based on the CCHR rule, this decision was further supported by cost-effectiveness evidence. This showed the CCHR rule to be the most cost effective of the multiple decision rules assessed.\nThe committee noted that the existing recommendations for clinical decision rules for head imaging in people under 16 were largely based on the CHALICE rules with some modifications. These modifications were based on current practice and experience allowing for the option of an observation period with imaging if the condition of some people deteriorated, rather than immediate imaging.\nUpdated evidence identified for this decision rule showed that it had good sensitivity when considering clinically important injuries or neurosurgical outcomes. In the 2014 update of this guideline, the committee stated that an improvement in specificity relative to the NICE recommendations would be needed to warrant switching to another decision rule for people under 16. They noted that PECARN and CATCH‑7 may have slightly better sensitivity values compared with CHALICE, but agreed that, overall:\nthe specificity values for CHALICE are much better than for other rules assessed\nthe sensitivity values for CHALICE are still over 90% for clinically important injuries and neurosurgical outcomes.\nThe committee noted that, in terms of the content of the rules, PECARN and the NICE guideline are not very different but that PECARN is vaguer and does not give timings. They thought this less useful. In addition, they noted that the PECARN and CATCH-7 rules apply to more specific populations than the NICE guideline recommendations.\nThe committee agreed that the recommendations in the NICE guideline are in widespread use in current practice, and used with little variation. Their opinion was that they are currently well-accepted and used with good effect. The committee therefore agreed that there was insufficient evidence to support changing the clinical decision rule recommendations for head imaging in people under 16.\nThe committee agreed to keep the existing recommendations in from the 2014 update of NICE's head injury guideline for people with bleeding and clotting disorders. This was because there was no new evidence to change practice in adults, and the committee agreed to extrapolate from an existing recommendation to make a new recommendation for people under 16. However, they changed the recommendation wording from 'history of bleeding or clotting disorders' to 'current bleeding or clotting disorders'. In children, some disorders are short-lived or resolve in a couple of months. In adults, a history of bleeding or clotting disorders is used to help screen people before surgery. However, this is a crude tool and may not be appropriate in this setting. So, the committee agreed to keep the changed wording for all age groups to help provide a consistent message.\n discussed that neurosurgical intervention for traumatic brain injury is less likely to be offered for people over 74 because risks outweigh the benefits.\n agreed that antiplatelets other than aspirin monotherapy should be included but did not specify which antiplatelets. This was because they did not want to be prescriptive and exclude any newer antiplatelets in development. Based on their experience and extrapolation of evidence in people presenting within 8 hours of injury, the committee agreed that these recommendations could be applicable to people presenting more than 8 hours after their injury. However, they agreed that imaging should be done within an hour of confirming that the person with head injury is on anticoagulant or antiplatelet medication.\nThere was limited evidence on aspirin. From their knowledge and clinical experience, the committee highlighted that the risk of intracranial haemorrhage is low with aspirin. This is even so in people with neurological symptoms such as loss of consciousness or amnesia. So, they agreed that people on aspirin monotherapy could be discharged without a CT head scan after shared decision making if there is no other indication for a CT brain scan or hospital admission.\nThe committee made a recommendation for research on risk of bleeding for people with pre-injury coagulopathy.\nPeople with liver or coagulopathy disorders\nThere was no evidence for people with liver or coagulopathy disorders. Current practice is variable, with some services offering imaging to people with liver disease who have no symptoms. People with liver or coagulopathy disorders are at increased risk of bleeding, although some people will have a tendency for increased clotting. People with acquired coagulation defects can be a heterogenous and complex group. They can include people with acquired haemophilia through to people with other abnormalities such as disseminated intravascular coagulation.\nThe committee agreed to keep the existing recommendations from the 2014 update of NICE's head injury guideline for people with bleeding and clotting disorders. This was because there was no new evidence to change practice. But they changed the recommendation wording from 'history of bleeding or clotting disorders' to 'current bleeding or clotting disorders'. In people under 16, some disorders are short-lived or resolve in a couple of months. In adults, a history of bleeding or clotting disorders is used to help screen people before surgery. However, this may not be appropriate in the emergency department setting. So, the committee agreed to keep the changed wording for all age groups to help provide a consistent message.\nPeople with pre-injury cognitive impairment who have a head injury through low-energy impact or low-level falls\nLimited evidence from cohort studies suggested that, in people 16 and over, falling from a standing position, being over 70, having a reduced GCS score compared with normal, taking antiplatelet medication including aspirin, and having neurological symptoms (loss of consciousness, vomiting after fall) were risk factors associated with the diagnosis of an intracranial bleed. Anticoagulant medication in this population was not associated with an intracranial bleed. It was not clear if people in the studies had pre-injury cognitive impairment, so the applicability of this evidence is limited.\n difficult to differentiate head injury symptoms from the pre-existing dementia in these people. There was no evidence for people under 16.\nThe committee acknowledged the limited evidence for this group. They made a recommendation for research on indications for imaging for people with pre-injury cognitive impairment.\nPeople with recurrent head injuries\nThere was no evidence for recurrent head injuries in any age group. Recurrent head injuries could occur in people with epilepsy, people with mobility issues at high risk of falls and with some sports activities. Particularly in the context of sports injuries, these injuries can be repeated and lead to cumulative risks. Because of a lack of evidence, the committee decided to make a recommendation for research on indications for imaging for people with a history of recurrent traumatic head injuries.\nEvidence from 1 observational study suggested that there was an increased risk of any traumatic brain injury or important traumatic brain injury on a CT head scan in babies and children under 2 years:\nthe younger their age\nif they have a GCS score of less than 15\nif they present more than 24 hours after head injury.\n agreed that this was an important area, so proposed a recommendation for research on indications for selecting people for imaging when they present more than 24 hours after a head injury.\n\n【83】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice or services\nWeakening the recommendation for people with a head injury who are on anticoagulants but have no other indication for imaging from 'offer' to 'consider' is expected to result in fewer scans. But expanding the recommendation to include people with a head injury who are on clopidogrel, prasugrel or ticagrelor is expected to result in more scans. It is uncertain whether this will lead to an overall increase or decrease in scanning.\nReturn to recommendations\n\n【84】 # Post-concussion syndrome\nRecommendation 1.5.15\n\n【85】 ## Why the committee made the recommendation\nThe committee agreed that high specificity is needed for brain injury biomarkers for post-concussion syndrome. This was because the population with a mild head injury is large but only a small proportion go on to develop post-concussion syndrome. So, false positives would have a negative effect on resources if biomarkers were to be used to direct everyone towards interventions or monitoring.\n made a recommendation for research on using biomarkers and MRI for predicting post-concussion syndrome.\nEvidence from diagnostic accuracy studies suggested that there were high sensitivity values for some biomarkers at certain thresholds for predicting acute complications after a traumatic brain injury, but the specificity values were not high enough across the evidence. Also, many biomarkers were only tested in small samples, which led to imprecise estimates. The committee noted that accuracy differed quite widely between different studies looking at the same biomarker test measured with different assays on different platforms. Also, the evidence was heterogenous, with variable thresholds and time points for different biomarkers. Most people with a head injury present to hospital within 3 hours, and the manufacturers recommend this timeframe for optimal test results. Many of the studies assessed biomarkers beyond this time point.\nThe committee agreed that the specificity values were equally as important as the sensitivity values, given the consequences of unnecessary radiation from CT scans. They thought this was particularly important in people under 16. But, after considering the limitations of the evidence, the committee were unable to make recommendations for using biomarkers to predict acute complications after a mild traumatic brain injury. They did think that biomarker tests had promise, so they proposed a recommendation for research on using biomarkers for predicting acute post-traumatic brain injury complications.\n\n【86】 ## How the recommendation might affect practice or services\nBiomarkers are not routinely used in people with acute head injury and the recommendation for MRI has not changed. So, there is not expected to be a change in practice.\nReturn to recommendation\n\n【87】 # Investigating injuries to the cervical spine\nRecommendations 1.6.1 to 1.6.11\n\n【88】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThe committee considered sensitivity to be the most important measure for types of investigation for cervical spine injuries in people with head injuries. This is to ensure the investigation does not miss important cervical spine injuries, which could result in subsequent negative consequences such as disability. The evidence was limited because the proportion of people with a confirmed head injury was not reported in the diagnostic accuracy studies, but it suggested that X‑rays have poor sensitivity compared with CT scans in people 16 and over.\n agreed that CT scans of the cervical spine should be used in people 16 and over in a way consistent with current clinical practice. There was limited evidence for MRI . For people under 16, limitations in the evidence, and radiation exposure and risk of cancer, contributed to the committee's decision not to make any major changes to the recommendations.\n\n【89】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice or services\nCT scanning of the neck in people 16 and over with a head injury has already replaced X‑rays when there is at least a medium risk of serious spinal injury. So, there is not expected to be a change in practice.\nReturn to recommendations\n\n【90】 # Admission and observation\nRecommendations 1.9.1 to 1.9.5\n\n【91】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nLimited evidence from cohort studies in people with intracranial injuries suggested that effect sizes for the clinical decision rules were larger overall than those for individual risk factors. So, the committee agreed that clinical decision rules were likely to be the way to identify people who should be admitted in the future. This was because they thought it would be difficult to make decisions based on individual risk factors in clinical practice. But the evidence for clinical decision rules was all retrospective. So, the committee did not think any specific clinical decision rules could be recommended, particularly because they would be new to clinical practice.\nFor individual risk factors, the committee noted that there was consistent evidence across all studies (including 1 study in people under  that GCS scores of 13 and 14 were associated with a worse outcome than a GCS score of 15. But this is already an existing indication for admission  recommendation 1.9..\n noted that the varying thresholds used for subdural and epidural haemorrhage across the different studies made the ideal threshold to use unclear.\n be associated with harms such as hospital-acquired infections. The committee agreed that age or frailty may be a concern but should not be a sole indicator for admission. Overall, the committee agreed that prospective studies are needed in people with a GCS score of 13, 14 or 15 and a head injury of any size confirmed with CT to validate existing clinical decision rules for predicting deterioration. The aim would be to refine indications for admission in this group. So, the committee made a recommendation for research on indications for admission in people with a mild head injury and a confirmed abnormality on a CT scan.\nEvidence from several case series suggested that there was low risk of death, neurosurgery, admission to critical care, unplanned hospital admission and delayed intracranial injury in babies and children (age cut-off varied across studies) with an isolated skull fracture. The evidence suggested that there was a slightly higher risk of seizure (at presentation) and evaluation for suspected non-accidental injury in this group. According to current guidelines (recommendations 1.5.8 and 1.5., people with seizures and suspected non-accidental injuries will be admitted to hospital after a head injury.\nBased on the evidence, the committee agreed that simple linear non-displaced fractures are not likely to be a clinically important injury. So, they agreed that, after shared decision making, people under 16 with such fractures can be safely discharged if they have normal neurological status and there are no safeguarding concerns.\nThere was no direct evidence for people 16 and over with an isolated skull fracture. Indirect evidence from cohort studies suggested that there was low risk of clinical deterioration from a simple skull fracture compared with:\na complex skull fracture\nto 2 bleeds\nbleeds less than 5 mm in diameter\nno or minimal mass effect\nsignificant midline shift\na high- or mixed-density lesion\ncerebellar or brain stem injury.\nClinical deterioration was measured by a composite of death due to traumatic brain injury, neurosurgery, seizure, a fall in GCS score of more than 1, admission into intensive care for traumatic brain injury, intubation or hospital readmission for traumatic brain injury. The simple skull fracture group included both isolated and non-isolated skull fractures. But the committee agreed that the evidence is still likely to be broadly applicable for people 16 and over with an isolated skull fracture. Based on the evidence and their collective experience, the committee agreed that, after shared decision making, people 16 and over with an isolated skull fracture can be discharged safely (except for people on anticoagulants or antiplatelets) if there are no safety concerns.\nThe evidence was limited on admission to and observation in hospital of people who have a head injury and are on anticoagulants (warfarin and other vitamin K antagonists, and direct-acting oral anticoagulants) or antiplatelets (including aspirin, ticlopidine, clopidogrel, prasugrel and ticagrelor), and have normal brain imaging or no indication for early imaging.\nLimited evidence from non-randomised studies suggested that there was no clinically important difference between pre-injury anticoagulant or no anticoagulant treatment in terms of delayed bleeding. The evidence included at least 1 propensity matched study including about 70,000 people.\nThe committee agreed that the evidence was not strong enough to recommend using anticoagulation status as a sole indicator for admission for people with a negative initial CT head scan. They highlighted that admission based solely on this could cause harm in people already vulnerable (because of, for example, frailty, an underlying condition such as delirium or risk of hospital-acquired infections). This is particularly so if there is not a large increase in risk of delayed bleeding. Also, when these events do occur, they are usually not clinically important.\nEvidence from non-randomised studies for antiplatelet comparisons was more limited than that for anticoagulants. There were no large studies, and all reported effects were based on a difference of only 1 to 2 events between pre-injury antiplatelet and no-antiplatelet groups per study. The committee agreed that the evidence was not strong enough to recommend using antiplatelet status as a sole indicator for admission for people with a negative initial CT or no indication for a CT. The committee did not make a recommendation for research for this group because they did not consider it to be a priority for research.\n noted that someone's condition may worsen if they are admitted, for example, because of being in a noisy and unfamiliar environment, and because the risk of hospital-acquired infections could increase. When people with concussion symptoms are discharged, information is provided on when to return to hospital to seek further immediate care and ongoing support for persistent symptoms  the recommendations on discharge advice). The committee agreed that this is important and did not think there was any evidence on which to base a change in practice.\n\n【92】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice or services\nCurrently, most people with an isolated skull fracture are admitted for observation. It is expected that many of these people could be discharged from the emergency department without admission to hospital unless there are other indications for admission. For people on anticoagulants or antiplatelets, and people with concussion symptoms, there are no significant changes in practice recommended, and the recommendations are thought to reflect current practice.\nReturn to recommendations\n\n【93】 # Early diagnosis of hypopituitarism\nRecommendations 1.9.6 to 1.9.8\n\n【94】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThe committee highlighted that there is a higher risk of hypopituitarism with more severe head injuries, but noted that it can be caused by a mild head injury. Also, the condition can occur immediately after a head injury or in the weeks to months afterwards. This, and the wide variety of symptoms of hypopituitarism, can make the condition difficult to diagnose.\nThe committee supplemented the small amount of observational evidence (cohort studies) with their expertise. They discussed that why head injury causes hypopituitarism is not fully understood, and that there could be various reasons. Current practice for screening for hypopituitarism is variable, but it is not commonly identified on CT scanning in the emergency department. The clinician's familiarity and suspicion of hypopituitarism may affect diagnosis rates. Also, testing in the emergency department may not be useful because the acute injury phase stimulates cortisol secretion. This makes it difficult to tell if there is hypoadrenalism. So, the committee agreed that it would be better to investigate for hypopituitarism in people admitted to hospital with a head injury if they have clinical symptoms or biochemical findings such as hypotension or hyponatraemia. The committee suggested this would provide an opportunity for referral to a specialist.\n made a recommendation for research on timing of testing for hypopituitarism.\n\n【95】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice or services\n intended that people will get referred for specialist care sooner.\nReturn to recommendations\n\n【96】 # Discharge and follow up\nRecommendation 1.10.6\n\n【97】 ## Why the committee made the recommendation\n noted to be important for people discharged to custodial settings. The committee noted that, at discharge, it is important for people and their carers to be given a written copy of the head injury discharge advice.\n\n【98】 ## How the recommendation might affect practice or services\nThere might be a small increase in overnight admissions for people with a pre-existing cognitive impairment when no supervision is available at home. This should lead to better outcomes for people who do deteriorate and reduced longer-term care costs.\nReturn to recommendation\n\n【99】 # Follow up\nRecommendations 1.10.13 and 1.10.14\n\n【100】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\n important for healthcare professionals to make appropriate outpatient referrals to other healthcare professionals trained in managing these symptoms.\nSome people who have had a head injury will be at increased risk of further injury. It is important that these people can access relevant services.\n\n【101】 ## How the recommendation might affect practice or services\nThere might be an increase in referrals from primary care to hospital outpatient clinics for people who were not admitted to hospital, or had a normal scan or no scan at the time of their head injury. This should mean that people get earlier access to effective treatment for persisting symptoms resulting from their head injury and prevention services.\nReturn to recommendation\n\n【102】 # Investigations for hypopituitarism\nRecommendation 1.10.15\n\n【103】 ## Why the committee made the recommendation\nThe committee discussed further endocrinology investigations for suspected hypopituitarism in people who have been discharged after a head injury if symptoms persist or they are not recovering as expected. They noted that some of the symptoms of hypopituitarism may be non-specific and caused by other conditions, making diagnosis difficult. They agreed that investigation in endocrinology may be needed.\nIn people under 16, delayed symptoms may include slow growth, tiredness and late puberty. The committee emphasised that, if hypopituitarism is suspected, it is important to urgently refer the person under 16 to a paediatric endocrinologist.\n\n【104】 ## How the recommendation might affect practice or services\n intended that people will get referred for appropriate care sooner.\nReturn to recommendation# Context\nHead injuries are a major cause of death and disability in people aged 1 to 40 in the UK. Each year, over 1 million people attend emergency departments in England and Wales with a recent head injury. Between 33% and 50% of these people are aged under 15. About 200,000 people are admitted to hospital with a head injury every year. Of these, about 40,000 have evidence of traumatic brain injury. Most people with a head injury recover without specific or specialist intervention. Others have long-term disability or even die from associated traumatic brain or other injuries. An increasing proportion of people presenting with head injury are over 65. Many people are injured through low-level falls, which can be sustained in the context of acute illness.\nThe incidence of death from head injuries is low. As few as 0.2% of people attending emergency departments with a head injury die because of their injury. Of people who have sustained a head injury, 95% present with a normal or minimally impaired conscious level, that is, a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 13 or more. Most fatal outcomes are in the groups with a moderate (GCS score of 9 to  or severe (GCS score of 8 or less) head injury, and account for only 5% of attenders. This means emergency departments need to identify the small number who will go on to have serious acute intracranial complications. It is estimated that, in 25% to 30% of children under 2 who are hospitalised with a head injury, it is caused by abuse. This guideline has updated some of the terminology used in relation to safeguarding people under 18 and vulnerable adults. This update addresses these areas, including in particular:\nindications for transporting people with a head injury from the scene of injury directly to the nearest neuroscience centre, bypassing the nearest emergency department\nindications for, and timing of, CT head scans and imaging of the cervical spine in the emergency department, with particular reference to anticoagulant treatment and levels of circulating brain injury biomarkers\nthe clinical and cost effectiveness of administering tranexamic acid to people who have sustained a head injury and have suspected intracranial bleeding\nconsideration of traumatic injury to the pituitary gland in people with a head injury\ninformation that should be provided to people with a head injury, and their family members and carers, on discharge from the emergency department or observation ward.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

They link to details of the evidence and a full description of the committee's discussion.\n\n【29】 # Organising alcohol education\nRecommendations 1.1.1 to 1.1.2\n\n【30】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nIt is current practice for schools to use a whole-school approach for alcohol education (universal and targeted) and other health-related topics that have a personal, social, health and economic education (PSHE) component. This helps schools ensure that consistent messages are given about a topic, such as alcohol education, whether taught through relationships education, relationships and sex education (RSE) and health education, or PSHE and the national science curriculum. In England universal alcohol education forms part of the usual curriculum delivered through health education or PSHE.\nEvidence was identified on delivering universal alcohol-specific education programmes in a mix of approaches and components (for example, in or out of the classroom, on its own or in combination with family or community). This evidence showed that the effectiveness of specific universal alcohol education programmes is no better than usual alcohol education. In England usual alcohol education is delivered through health education or PSHE, so the committee thought that alcohol education could continue to be delivered this way.\n had a significant impact on cost effectiveness because of their high associated costs.\nThe cost-effectiveness analysis showed that universal interventions are more likely to be cost effective in the older age groups that might be drinking already, than in the younger ones that might not. The committee were concerned that this might lead to a focus on interventions for older children and young people. However, they did not think the evidence justified prioritising interventions for these groups because of limitations in study design. In addition, the studies used short follow-up, compared the interventions with usual education, and used outcomes such as problematic drinking (which is less common in younger age groups and unlikely to capture other benefits of alcohol education).\n showed that it can be difficult to engage parents successfully (for example to attend family education activities at school). The committee agreed that more research was needed to evaluate the different ways to do this  the recommendation for research on engaging parents and carers in the whole-school approach to alcohol education).\nEvidence from qualitative studies showed that teachers may lack confidence in teaching alcohol education and don't know the best materials to use. The committee were aware of accredited materials and training resources (although not reviewed by NICE) based on their experience of current practice. These include materials from PSHE Association, Public Health England and Mentor-ADEPIS.\n aware of international criteria on how to select teaching materials and support resources  the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime guidance on school-based education for drug abuse prevention), but NICE did not review this.\n concern that adapting examples of good practice for local needs may alter the effectiveness of interventions (for example straying too far from key content and processes).\nEvidence from qualitative studies shows that many schools find it difficult to prioritise alcohol education because of the demands of a crowded curriculum. But, given that health education will be compulsory from 2020, the committee thought it important that schools find time to plan for alcohol education in the curriculum.\n\n【31】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\nThe recommendations will aim to reinforce current best practice because they are based on existing processes that all schools should be following and will become mandatory. However, the statutory changes may mean that schools need to make changes in how they prioritise health education as part of their overall curriculum planning.\nReturn to recommendations\n\n【32】 # Planning alcohol education content\nRecommendations 1.1.3 to 1.1.5\n\n【33】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\n believe that it should be tailored to the levels of need and maturity. Evidence from expert testimony highlighted that accounting for these factors will help avoid unintended consequences.\nExperts told the committee that making alcohol education age appropriate can be achieved using a 'spiral curriculum' approach. Taking into consideration the need for alcohol education to be age appropriate to minimise harm, the committee agreed that the spiral curriculum concept is a logical approach to do this.\nNo evidence was identified for alcohol education specific to pupils with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND), and intervention studies carried out in schools often exclude pupils with SEND. Therefore the committee could not recommend any specific adaptations to alcohol education for SEND pupils. But they thought it was important for schools to consider adapting alcohol education to the needs of their SEND pupils. The Department for Education's SEND code of practice sets out how schools can ensure equality of access to the curriculum and inclusion in all school activities for SEND pupils. Therefore research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of such interventions for this group and of alcohol education  the recommendations for research on components of alcohol education delivery, universal interventions for people aged 11 to 25 with special educational needs and disabilities, targeted interventions for people aged 11 to 25 with SEND and preventive work for people aged 11 to 25 with SEND.\n\n【34】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\nThe recommendations will aim to reinforce current best practice because they are based on existing processes that all schools should be following. Schools should already be considering adapting education for their SEND pupils so it is not anticipated that there will be any resource impact.\nReturn to recommendations\n\n【35】 # Confidentiality and safeguarding\nRecommendations 1.1.6 to 1.1.9\n\n【36】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\n suggested that schools should be prepared to deal with unintended consequences and so the committee made a recommendation that this should be planned for and anticipated.\n showed that some pupils may be reluctant to share information in a group setting for fear of the information being shared, and of being teased or bullied by their peers. The committee wanted schools to be aware of this and suggested that following existing school policies, for example on bullying, should help to minimise this.\nIt is current practice for schools to have a process in place so that pupils know that they can speak confidentially, and to allow for concerns to be raised and local safeguarding processes to be followed. (For example, see Public Health England's guidance on safeguarding children affected by parental alcohol and drug use.)\n\n【37】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\nThe recommendations will aim to reinforce current best practice because they are based on existing processes that all schools should be following.\nReturn to recommendations\n\n【38】 # Referral for further support\nRecommendations 1.1.10 to 1.1.11\n\n【39】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nAlcohol education may bring to light some matters that may lead to safeguarding issues or unmet mental health needs  the Department for Health and Social Care and Department for Education's Transforming children and young people's mental health provision: a green paper). Schools should ensure that alcohol education is considered in policies and practices introduced or updated in response to the green paper.\nThe committee advised that it is best practice for schools to have clear referral pathways to relevant specialist agencies such as school nursing. The local availability of specialist agencies varies, so the committee suggested examples of services that fulfil this criterion. The committee wanted to reinforce the need for all those providing alcohol education to be aware of safeguarding and of the referral pathways in place. This would help to provide as much support for pupils as possible. For example, the Early Help Assessment is designed to help ensure a pupil is offered the right support at an early stage. If these external specialist interventions are needed, the school needs to involve the pupil and their parents or carers. The committee thought that this would be a way of increasing the chances of success of any intervention by allowing them to consult and agree on the best approach for referral to these services.\n\n【40】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\nThe recommendations will aim to reinforce current best practice because they are based on existing processes that all schools should be following. However, statutory changes may mean that schools need to make changes in how they prioritise health education as part of their overall curriculum planning. Schools currently refer pupils to school nursing, school counsellors or external specialist services such as young people's specialist drug and alcohol services. There may be some resource implications depending on who delivers the interventions if the number of referrals increases.\nReturn to recommendations\n\n【41】 # Structuring alcohol education\nRecommendation 1.2.1\n\n【42】 ## Why the committee made the recommendation\nEvidence from qualitative studies and expert testimony suggests that negative messages, scare tactics or providing information about alcohol in isolation do not work and may lead to harm, especially when they are not age appropriate. These approaches are not likely to be tailored to pupils' current understanding and perceptions of alcohol and therefore pupils may rebel against such messages. The evidence showed that pupils favour a non-judgemental environment where they can discuss alcohol in the context of real-life situations.\nEvidence from expert testimony highlighted that tailoring alcohol education to age, levels of need and maturity will help avoid unintended consequences. For example, a pupil who has not started drinking alcohol may want to try it once they start to learn more about it. Or when they learn that they should not drink alcohol or cannot buy it, they may choose another substance instead.\n promote inclusivity for those who choose to not drink or to delay starting to drink, or who do not drink for cultural or religious reasons.\nTaking all this into consideration, the committee agreed that it is important to highlight the hazards of excessive drinking. Education that encourages discussion (for example around healthy lifestyle decisions) is more beneficial than merely giving out information, for example, using leaflets or 'one-way' lectures.\n\n【43】 ## How the recommendation might affect practice\nThe recommendation will aim to reinforce current best practice because it is based on existing processes that all schools should be following and will become mandatory. However, the statutory changes may mean that schools need to make changes in how they prioritise health education as part of their overall curriculum planning.\nReturn to recommendation\n\n【44】 # Using additional support for alcohol education\nRecommendations 1.2.2 to 1.2.3\n\n【45】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThe evidence is consistent with current practice that school staff and other providers, including external speakers, can deliver alcohol education. However, there is conflicting evidence on who is best placed to deliver these interventions. Pupils favour a familiar member of school staff, but teachers may lack confidence in teaching alcohol education. Research is needed on the effectiveness of the different components of alcohol education delivery, including providers of the education  the recommendation for research on components of alcohol education delivery).\n supported the committee's experience that some external providers may be unsuccessful in getting the right message across and their approach may be potentially harmful. Experts on the committee said that negative approaches and scare tactics sometimes used by police officers or people who misuse alcohol (or are dependent on it), for example, could either scare pupils or inadvertently glamorise alcohol misuse. The committee agreed that it is the school's responsibility to ensure the external providers they choose meet standards that allow pupils to learn safely and effectively. The committee were aware of examples of how to access guidance to assess external providers, for example PSHE Association and Mentor-ADEPIS.\n\n【46】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\nThe recommendations will aim to reinforce current best practice because they are based on existing processes that all schools should be following. The use of external providers (such as school nurses, local public health officers and drug and alcohol services) to support alcohol education varies, and there may be a cost associated with this provision. This may then affect staff workload in terms of planning and delivering the alcohol education.\nReturn to recommendations\n\n【47】 # Selecting pupils for targeted interventions\nRecommendations 1.3.1 to 1.3.5\n\n【48】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nEvidence suggests that targeted interventions for pupils who are vulnerable to alcohol misuse may be effective. These studies included individual or group brief interventions or counselling that are delivered over 1 to 5 sessions. The committee were unable to recommend specific details for these interventions because they thought the interventions would depend on the pupil's specific needs. For example, one pupil may benefit from a one-off session whereas another may need follow-up sessions or further support. It was not possible to determine the effectiveness of individual interventions compared with group interventions, and more research is needed on this  recommendations for research on targeted school-based interventions and targeted interventions for people aged 11 to 25 with SEND).\n had a significant impact on cost effectiveness because of their high associated costs.\nThe cost-effectiveness analysis showed that targeted interventions are more likely to be cost effective in the older age groups that might be drinking already, than in the younger ones that might not. The committee were concerned that this might lead to a focus on interventions for older children and young people. However, they did not think the evidence justified prioritising interventions for these groups because of limitations in study design. In addition, the studies used short follow-up, compared the interventions with usual education, and used outcomes such as problematic drinking (which is less common in younger age groups and unlikely to capture other benefits of alcohol education).\nExperts told the committee that when planning an intervention it is important to consider any potential unintended consequences. This supported the committee's view that care should be taken to avoid 'labelling' or stigmatising pupils when selecting vulnerable pupils for a targeted intervention. For example, if a pupil needs to leave lessons for a counselling session, classmates or teachers might treat them differently, and they could be at increased risk of bullying. They may become withdrawn or defiant as a result, and increase the behaviour that the intervention is intended to prevent.\nThe committee were clear that seeking consent from the pupil or their guardian when offering any intervention is best practice. Also, for alcohol education to be successful the pupil must be a willing participant and seeking consent from them (or their families and carers) is an important part of following a whole-school approach.\n\n【49】 ## How the recommendations might affect practice\nThe recommendations will reinforce best practice because they are based on existing processes and on guidance on individual sessions for vulnerable people. Using group, rather than one-to-one, interventions will potentially lead to savings but it is not clear how often these would be used.\nReturn to recommendations\n\n【50】 # Tailoring targeted interventions\nRecommendation 1.3.6\n\n【51】 ## Why the committee made the recommendation\n be particularly vulnerable. How best to identify those who may benefit from targeted interventions was not included in the scope and so the committee were not able to make a recommendation on this issue.\nSchools might use several factors to determine whether a pupil is vulnerable to alcohol misuse. In addition, the committee thought it important to ensure that the alcohol intervention is tailored to the pupil's needs. Therefore they agreed that there should be an assessment of the pupil's individual risk factors and needs, as well as planned outcomes in respect of this. The committee suggested using existing processes, for example by using information from a level of needs assessment. Other sources include information derived from the whole-school approach or children's services (including children's social care), as well as more informal sources such as reports from the local community.\n\n【52】 ## How the recommendation might affect practice\nThe recommendation will reinforce current practice because it is based on existing processes. These sources of information should be readily available to all concerned so there should not be any additional resource impact.\nReturn to recommendation\n\n【53】 # Avoiding unintended consequences of group interventions\nRecommendation 1.3.7\n\n【54】 ## Why the committee made the recommendation\nThere could be many reasons why someone is vulnerable to alcohol misuse, and including them in a targeted group intervention may lead to normalising unhealthy drinking behaviours. For example, if the group includes people of different ages and the older pupils are already drinking, the younger pupils (who may be non-drinkers) might try alcohol because they begin to see it as 'normal'. The committee agreed with expert testimony that unintended consequences of interventions should be avoided when deciding on the best approach for group interventions.\n\n【55】 ## How the recommendation might affect practice\nThe recommendation will reinforce best practice because it is based on existing processes and existing guidance. But having multiple groups based on age may result in additional resource impact depending on who delivers these interventions and how frequently they are run.\nReturn to recommendation# Context\n associated with a higher likelihood of alcohol dependence.\n show that:\n% of 11- to 15‑year olds had tried alcohol\n% of 11- to 15‑year olds had drunk alcohol in the past week\npupils who drank alcohol in the past week consumed an average (mean) of 9.6 units\ngirls (11%) were more likely than boys (7%) to report having been drunk in the past 4 weeks.\n changed.\nIn addition, the Chief Medical Officer's guidance on the consumption of alcohol by children and young people was published in 2009. This advises parents and children that an alcohol-free childhood is the healthiest and best option.\nIn light of all these changes, we decided to update the guideline.\nThe Department of Health and Social Care's youth alcohol action plan acknowledges that alcohol education in schools is crucial. In England, personal, social, health and economic education (PSHE) is the most common way to deliver this. Currently PSHE is not statutory (Personal, social, health and economic education, Department for Education). But from 2020 the health aspects will be compulsory in all schools.\nThis guideline covers children and young people aged 11 to 18 in full-time education and young people aged 18 to 25 with special educational needs and disabilities in full-time education.

Common adverse reactions include headache, nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain.\n\n【3】 # Adult Indications and Dosage\n\n【4】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Adult)\n- Zafirlukast is indicated for the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma in adults and children 5 years of age and older.\n\n【5】 ### Dosing Information\n- Because food can reduce the bioavailability of zafirlukast, Zafirlukast should be taken at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after meals.\n- The recommended dose of Zafirlukast in adults and children 12 years and older is 20 mg twice daily.\n- Based on cross-study comparisons, the clearance of zafirlukast is reduced in elderly patients (65 years of age and older), such that Cmax and AUC are approximately twice those of younger adults. In clinical trials, a dose of 20 mg twice daily was not associated with an increase in the overall incidence of adverse events or withdrawals because of adverse events in elderly patients.\n- Zafirlukast is contraindicated in patients with hepatic impairment including hepatic cirrhosis  Contraindications). The clearance of zafirlukast is reduced in patients with salcoholic cirrhosis such that the Cmax and AUC are approximately 50 - 60% greater than those of normal adults. Zafirlukast has not been evaluated in patients with hepatitis or in long-term studies of patients with cirrhosis.\n- Dosage adjustment is not required for patients with renal impairment.\n\n【6】 ## Off-Label Use and Dosage (Adult)\n\n【7】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Zafirlukast in adult patients.\n\n【8】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Zafirlukast in adult patients.\n\n【9】 # Pediatric Indications and Dosage\n\n【10】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Pediatric)\n- Zafirlukast is indicated for the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma in adults and children 5 years of age and older.\n\n【11】 ### Dosing Information\n- The recommended dose of Zafirlukast in children 5 through 11 years of age is 10 mg twice daily.\n\n【12】 ## Off-Label Use and Dosage (Pediatric)\n\n【13】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Zafirlukast in pediatric patients.\n\n【14】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Zafirlukast in pediatric patients.\n\n【15】 # Contraindications\n- Zafirlukast is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to zafirlukast or any of its inactive ingredients.\n- Zafirlukast is contraindicated in patients with hepatic impairment including hepatic cirrhosis.\n\n【16】 # Warnings\n- Cases of life-threatening hepatic failure have been reported in patients treated with Zafirlukast. Cases of liver injury without other attribucause have been reported from post-marketing adverse event surveillance of patients who have received the recommended dose of Zafirlukast (40 mg/day). In most, but not all post-marketing reports, the patient’s symptoms abated and the liver enzymes returned to normal or near normal after stopping Zafirlukast. In rare cases, patients have either presented with fulminant hepatitis or progressed to hepatic failure, liver transplantation and death. In extremely rare post-marketing cases, no clinical symptoms or signs suggestive of liver dysfunction were reported to precede the latter observations.\n- Physicians may consider the value of liver function testing. Periodic serum transaminase testing has not proven to prevent serious injury but it is generally believed that early detection of drug-induced hepatic injury along with immediate withdrawal of the suspect drug enhances the likelihood for recovery.\n- Patients should be advised to be alert for signs and symptoms of liver dysfunction (eg, right upper quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, fatigue, lethargy, pruritus, jaundice, flu-like symptoms, and anorexia) and to contact their physician immediately if they occur. Ongoing clinical assessment of patients should govern physician interventions, including diagnostic evaluations and treatment.\n- If liver dysfunction is suspected based upon clinical signs or symptoms (eg, right upper quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, fatigue, lethargy, pruritus, jaundice, flu-like symptoms, anorexia, and enlarged liver), Zafirlukast should be discontinued.\n- Liver function tests, in particular serum ALT, should be measured immediately and the patient managed accordingly. If liver function tests are consistent with hepatic dysfunction, Zafirlukast therapy should not be resumed. Patients in whom Zafirlukast was withdrawn because of hepatic dysfunction where no other attribucause is identified should not be re-exposed to Zafirlukast  PRECAUTIONS, INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS and ADVERSE REACTIONS).\n- Zafirlukast is not indicated for use in the reversal of bronchospasm in acute asthma attacks, including status asthmaticus. Therapy with Zafirlukast can be continued during acute exacerbations of asthma.\n- Coadministration of zafirlukast with warfarin results in a clinically significant increase in prothrombin time (PT). Patients on oral warfarin anticoagulant therapy and Zafirlukast should have their prothrombin times monitored closely and anticoagulant dose adjusted accordingly.\n\n【17】 ### PRECAUTIONS\n- In rare cases, patients with asthma on Zafirlukast may present with systemic eosinophilia, eosinophilic pneumonia, or clinical features of vasculitis consistent with Churg-Strauss syndrome, a condition which is often treated with systemic steroid therapy. Physicians should be alert to eosinophilia, vasculitic rash, worsening pulmonary symptoms, cardiac complications, and/or neuropathy presenting in their patients. These events have usually, but not always, been associated with reductions and/or withdrawal of steroid therapy. The possibility that Zafirlukast may be associated with emergence of Churg-Strauss syndrome can neither be excluded nor established  ADVERSE REACTIONS).\n- Neuropsychiatric events have been reported in adult, adolescent and pediatric patients taking Zafirlukast. Post-marketing reports with Zafirlukast include insomnia and depression. The clinical details of some post-marketing reports involving Zafirlukast appear consistent with a drug-induced effect. Patients and prescribers should be alert for neuropsychiatric events. Patients should be instructed to notify their prescriber if these changes occur. Prescribers should carefully evaluate the risks and benefits of continuing treatment with Zafirlukast if such events occur.\n\n【18】 # Adverse Reactions\n\n【19】 ## Clinical Trials Experience\n- The safety database for Zafirlukast consists of more than 4000 healthy volunteers and patients who received Zafirlukast, of which 1723 were asthmatics enrolled in trials of 13 weeks duration or longer. A total of 671 patients received Zafirlukast for 1 year or longer. The majority of the patients were 18 years of age or older; however, 222 patients between the age of 12 and 18 years received Zafirlukast.\n- A comparison of adverse events reported by ≥1% of zafirlukast-treated patients, and at rates numerically greater than in placebo-treated patients, is shown for all trials in the below.\n- The frequency of less common adverse events was comparable between Zafirlukast and placebo.\n- Rarely, elevations of one or more liver enzymes have occurred in patients receiving Zafirlukast in controlled clinical trials. In clinical trials, most of these have been observed at doses four times higher than the recommended dose. The following hepatic events (which have occurred predominantly in females) have been reported from postmarketing adverse event surveillance of patients who have received the recommended dose of Zafirlukast (40 mg/day): cases of symptomatic hepatitis (with or without hyperbilirubinemia) without other attribucause; and rarely, hyperbilirubinemia without other elevated liver function tests. In most, but not all postmarketing reports, the patient’s symptoms abated and the liver enzymes returned to normal or near normal after stopping Zafirlukast. In rare cases, patients have presented with fulminant hepatitis or progressed to hepatic failure, liver transplantation and death  WARNINGS, HEPATOTOXICITY and PRECAUTIONS, INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS).\n- In clinical trials, an increased proportion of zafirlukast patients over the age of 55 years reported infections as compared to placebo-treated patients. A similar finding was not observed in other age groups studied. These infections were mostly mild or moderate in intensity and predominantly affected the respiratory tract. Infections occurred equally in both sexes, were dose-proportional to total milligrams of zafirlukast exposure, and were associated with coadministration of inhaled corticosteroids. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown.\n- In rare cases, patients with asthma on Zafirlukast may present with systemic eosinophilia, eosinophilic pneumonia, or clinical features of vasculitis consistent with Churg-Strauss syndrome, a condition which is often treated with systemic steroid therapy. Physicians should be alert to eosinophilia, vasculitic rash, worsening pulmonary symptoms, cardiac complications, and/or neuropathy presenting in their patients. These events have usually, but not always, been associated with reductions and/or withdrawal of steroid therapy. The possibility that Zafirlukast may be associated with emergence of Churg-Strauss syndrome can neither be excluded nor established  PRECAUTIONS, EOSINOPHILIC CONDITIONS).\n been reported in association with Zafirlukast therapy. Additionally, there have been reports of patients experiencing agranulocytosis, bleeding, bruising, or edema, arthralgia, myalgia, malaise, and pruritus in association with Zafirlukast therapy.\n- Rare cases of patients experiencing increased theophylline levels with or without clinical signs or symptoms of theophylline toxicity after the addition of Zafirlukast to an existing theophylline regimen have been reported. The mechanism of the interaction between Zafirlukast and theophylline in these patients is unknown and not predicted by available in vitro metabolism data and the results of two clinical drug interaction studies.\n- Zafirlukast has been evaluated for safety in 788 pediatric patients 5 through 11 years of age. Cumulatively, 313 pediatric patients were treated with Zafirlukast 10 mg twice daily or higher for at least 6 months, and 113 of them were treated for one year or longer in clinical trials. The safety profile of Zafirlukast 10 mg twice daily-versus placebo in the 4- and 6-week double-blind trials was generally similar to that observed in the adult clinical trials with Zafirlukast 20 mg twice daily.\n- In pediatric patients receiving Zafirlukast in multi-dose clinical trials, the following events occurred with a frequency of ≥ 2% and more frequently than in pediatric patients who received placebo, regardless of causality assessment: headache (4.5 vs. 4.2%) and abdominal pain (2.8 vs. 2.3%).\n- The post-marketing experience in this age group is similar to that seen in adults, including hepatic dysfunction, which may lead to liver failure.\n\n【20】 ## Postmarketing Experience\nThere is limited information regarding Postmarketing Experience of Zafirlukast in the drug label.\n\n【21】 # Drug Interactions\n- In a drug interaction study in 16 healthy male volunteers, coadministration of multiple doses of zafirlukast (160 mg/day) to steady-state with a single 25 mg dose of warfarin resulted in a significant increase in the mean AUC (+ 63%) and half-life (+36%) of S-warfarin. The mean prothrombin time (PT) increased by approximately 35%. This interaction is probably due to an inhibition by zafirlukast of the cytochrome P450 2C9 isoenzyme system. Patients on oral warfarin anticoagulant therapy and Zafirlukast should have their prothrombin times monitored closely and anticoagulant dose adjusted accordingly  WARNINGS, CONCOMITANT WARFARIN ADMINISTRATION). No formal drug-drug interaction studies with Zafirlukast and other drugs known to be metabolized by the cytochrome P450 2C9 isoenzyme (eg, tolbutamide, phenytoin, carbamazepine) have been conducted; however, care should be exercised when Zafirlukast is coadministered with these drugs.\n- In a drug interaction study in 11 asthmatic patients, coadministration of a single dose of zafirlukast (40 mg) with erythromycin (500 mg three times daily for 5 days) to steady-state resulted in decreased mean plasma levels of zafirlukast by approximately 40% due to a decrease in zafirlukast bioavailability.\n- Coadministration of zafirlukast (20 mg/day) or placebo at steady-state with a single dose of sustained release theophylline preparation (16 mg/kg) in 16 healthy boys and girls (6 through 11 years of age) resulted in no significant differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters of theophylline.\n- Coadministration of zafirlukast (80 mg/day) at steady-state with a single dose of a liquid theophylline preparation (6 mg/kg) in 13 asthmatic patients, 18 to 44 years of age, resulted in decreased mean plasma levels of zafirlukast by approximately 30%, but no effect on plasma theophylline levels was observed.\n- Rare cases of patients experiencing increased theophylline levels with or without clinical signs or symptoms of theophylline toxicity after the addition of Zafirlukast to an existing theophylline regimen have been reported. The mechanism of the interaction between Zafirlukast and theophylline in these patients is unknown  ADVERSE REACTIONS).\n- Coadministration of zafirlukast (40 mg/day) with aspirin (650 mg four times daily) resulted in mean increased plasma levels of zafirlukast by approximately 45%.\n- In a single-blind, parallel-group, 3-week study in 39 healthy female subjects taking oral contraceptives, 40 mg twice daily of zafirlukast had no significant effect on ethinyl estradiol plasma concentrations or contraceptive efficacy.\n- Coadministration of zafirlukast with fluconazole, a moderate CYP2C9 inhibitor, resulted in increasedplasma levels of zafirlukast, by approximately 58% (90% CI:28, . The clinical significance of this interaction is unknown. Zafirlukast exposure is likely to be increased by other moderate and strong CYP2C9 inhibitors. Coadministration of zafirlukast with itraconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, caused no change in plasma levels of zafirlukast.\n- No other formal drug-drug interaction studies between Zafirlukast and marketed drugs known to be metabolized by the P450 3A4 (CYP3A isoenzyme (eg, dihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers, cyclosporin, cisapride) have been conducted. As Zafirlukast is known to be an inhibitor of CYP3A4 in vitro, it is reasonable to employ appropriate clinical monitoring when these drugs are coadministered with Zafirlukast.\n\n【22】 # Use in Specific Populations\n\n【23】 ### Pregnancy\nPregnancy Category (FDA): B\n- No teratogenicity was observed at oral doses up to 1600 mg/kg/day in mice (approximately 160 times the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults on a mg/m2 basis), up to 2000 mg/kg/day in rats (approximately 410 times the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults on a mg/m2 basis) and up to 2000 mg/kg/day in cynomolgus monkeys (which resulted in approximately 20 times the exposure to drug plus metabolites compared to that from the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults based on comparison of the AUC values). At an oral dose of 2000 mg/kg/day in rats, maternal toxicity and deaths were seen with increased incidence of early fetal resorption. Spontaneous abortions occurred in cynomolgus monkeys at the maternally toxic oral dose of 2000 mg/kg/day. There are no adequate and well-controlled trials in pregnant women. Because animal reproductive studies are not always predictive of human response, Zafirlukast should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.\nPregnancy Category (AUS):\n- Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) Pregnancy Category\nThere is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Zafirlukast in women who are pregnant.\n\n【24】 ### Labor and Delivery\nThere is no FDA guidance on use of Zafirlukast during labor and delivery.\n\n【25】 ### Nursing Mothers\n- Zafirlukast is excreted in breast milk. Following repeated 40 mg twice-a-day dosing in healthy women, average steady-state concentrations of zafirlukast in breast milk were 50 ng/mL compared to 255 ng/mL in plasma. Because of the potential for tumorigenicity shown for zafirlukast in mouse and rat studies and the enhanced sensitivity of neonatal rats and dogs to the adverse effects of zafirlukast, Zafirlukast should not be administered to mothers who are breast-feeding.\n\n【26】 ### Pediatric Use\n- The safety of Zafirlukast at doses of 10 mg twice daily has been demonstrated in 205 pediatric patients 5 through 11 years of age in placebo-controlled trials lasting up to six weeks and with 179 patients in this age range participating in 52 weeks of treatment in an open-label extension.\n- The effectiveness of Zafirlukast for the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma in pediatric patients 5 through 11 years of age is based on an extrapolation of the demonstrated efficacy of Zafirlukast in adults with asthma and the likelihood that the disease course, and pathophysiology and the drug’s effect are substantially similar between the two populations. The recommended dose for the patients 5 through 11 years of age is based upon a cross-study comparison of the pharmacokinetics of zafirlukast in adults and pediatric subjects, and on the safety profile of zafirlukast in both adult and pediatric patients at doses equal to or higher than the recommended dose.\n- The safety and effectiveness of zafirlukast for pediatric patients less than 5 years of age has not been established. The effect of Zafirlukast on growth in children has not been determined.\n\n【27】 ### Geriatic Use\n- Based on cross-study comparison, the clearance of zafirlukast is reduced in patients 65 years of age and older such that Cmax and AUC are approximately 2- to 3-fold greater than those of younger patients  DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).\n- A total of 8094 patients were exposed to zafirlukast in North American and European short-term placebo-controlled clinical trials. Of these, 243 patients were elderly (age 65 years and older). No overall difference in adverse events was seen in the elderly patients, except for an increase in the frequency of infections among zafirlukast-treated elderly patients compared to placebo-treated elderly patients (7.0% vs. 2.9%). The infections were not severe, occurred mostly in the lower respiratory tract, and did not necessitate withdrawal of therapy.\n- An open-label, uncontrolled, 4-week trial of 3759 asthma patients compared the safety and efficacy of Zafirlukast 20 mg given twice daily in three patient age groups, adolescents (12-17 years), adults (18-65 years), and elderly (greater than 65 years). A higher percentage of elderly patients (n= reported adverse events when compared to adults and adolescents. These elderly patients showed less improvement in efficacy measures. In the elderly patients, adverse events occurring in greater than 1% of the population included headache (4.7%), diarrhea and nausea (1.8%), and pharyngitis (1.3%). The elderly reported the lowest percentage of infections of all three age groups in this study.\n\n【28】 ### Gender\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Zafirlukast with respect to specific gender populations.\n\n【29】 ### Race\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Zafirlukast with respect to specific racial populations.\n\n【30】 ### Renal Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Zafirlukast in patients with renal impairment.\n\n【31】 ### Hepatic Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Zafirlukast in patients with hepatic impairment.\n\n【32】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Zafirlukast in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n\n【33】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\nThere is no FDA guidance one the use of Zafirlukast in patients who are immunocompromised.\n\n【34】 # Administration and Monitoring\n\n【35】 ### Administration\n- Oral\n\n【36】 ### Monitoring\nThere is limited information regarding Monitoring of Zafirlukast in the drug label.\n- Description\n\n【37】 # IV Compatibility\nThere is limited information regarding IV Compatibility of Zafirlukast in the drug label.\n\n【38】 # Overdosage\n- No deaths occurred at oral zafirlukast doses of 2000 mg/kg in mice (approximately 210 times the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults and children on a mg/m2 basis), 2000 mg/kg in rats (approximately 420 times the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults and children on a mg/m2 basis), and 500 mg/kg in dogs (approximately 350 times the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults and children on a mg/m2 basis).\n- Overdosage with Zafirlukast has been reported in four patients surviving reported doses as high as 200 mg. The predominant symptoms reported following Zafirlukast overdose were rash and upset stomach. There were no acute toxic effects in humans that could be consistently ascribed to the administration of Zafirlukast. It is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures in the event of an overdose; eg, remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring, and institute supportive therapy, if required.\n\n【39】 # Pharmacology\n\n【40】 ## Mechanism of Action\n- Zafirlukast is a selective and competitive receptor antagonist of leukotriene D4 and E4 (LTD4 and LTE, components of slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis (SRSA). Cysteinyl leukotriene production and receptor occupation have been correlated with the pathophysiology of asthma, including airway edema, smooth muscle constriction, and altered cellular activity associated with the inflammatory process, which contribute to the signs and symptoms of asthma. Patients with asthma were found in one study to be 25-100 times more sensitive to the bronchoconstricting activity of inhaled LTD4 than nonasthmatic subjects.\n- In vitro studies demonstrated that zafirlukast antagonized the contractile activity of three leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4 and LTE in conducting airway smooth muscle from laboratory animals and humans. Zafirlukast prevented intradermal LTD4-induced increases in cutaneous vascular permeability and inhibited inhaled LTD4-induced influx of eosinophils into animal lungs. Inhalational challenge studies in sensitized sheep showed that zafirlukast suppressed the airway responses to antigen; this included both the early- and late-phase response and the nonspecific hyperresponsiveness.\n attenuated the increase in bronchial hyperresponsiveness to inhaled histamine that followed inhaled allergen challenge.\n\n【41】 ## Structure\n- Zafirlukast is a synthetic, selective peptide leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA), with the chemical name 4-(5-cyclopentyloxy-carbonylamino-1-methyl-indol-3-ylmethyl)-3-methoxy-N-o-tolylsulfonylbenzamide. The molecular weight of zafirlukast is 575.7 and the structural formula is:\n\n【42】 ## Pharmacodynamics\nThere is limited information regarding Pharmacodynamics of Zafirlukast in the drug label.\n\n【43】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n- Zafirlukast is rapidly absorbed following oral administration. Peak plasma concentrations are generally achieved 3 hours after oral administration. The absolute bioavailability of zafirlukast is unknown. In two separate studies, one using a high fat and the other a high protein meal, administration of zafirlukast with food reduced the mean bioavailability by approximately 40%.\n- Zafirlukast is more than 99% bound to plasma proteins, predominantly albumin. The degree of binding was independent of concentration in the clinically relevant range. The apparent steady-state volume of distribution (Vss/F) is approximately 70 L, suggesting moderate distribution into tissues. Studies in rats using radiolabeled zafirlukast indicate minimal distribution across the blood-brain barrier.\n- Zafirlukast is extensively metabolized. The most common metabolic products are hydroxylated metabolites which are excreted in the feces. The metabolites of zafirlukast identified in plasma are at least 90 times less potent as LTD4 receptor antagonists than zafirlukast in a standard in vitro test of activity. In vitro studies using human liver microsomes showed that the hydroxylated metabolites of zafirlukast excreted in the feces are formed through the cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C pathway. Additional in vitro studies utilizing human liver microsomes show that zafirlukast inhibits the cytochrome P450 CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 isoenzymes at concentrations close to the clinically achieved total plasma concentrations.\n- The apparent oral clearance (CL/f) of zafirlukast is approximately 20 L/h. Studies in the rat and dog suggest that biliary excretion is the primary route of excretion. Following oral administration of radiolabeled zafirlukast to volunteers, urinary excretion accounts for approximately 10% of the dose and the remainder is excreted in feces. Zafirlukast is not detected in urine.\n- In the pivotal bioequivalence study, the mean terminal half-life of zafirlukast is approximately 10 hours in both normal adult subjects and patients with asthma. In other studies, the mean plasma half-life of zafirlukast ranged from approximately 8 to 16 hours in both normal subjects and patients with asthma. The pharmacokinetics of zafirlukast are approximately linear over the range from 5 mg to 80 mg. Steady-state plasma concentrations of zafirlukast are proportional to the dose and predicfrom single-dose pharmacokinetic data. Accumulation of zafirlukast in the plasma following twice-daily dosing is approximately 45%.\n- The pharmacokinetic parameters of zafirlukast 20 mg administered as a single dose to 36 male volunteers are shown with the below.\n- Gender:\n- The pharmacokinetics of zafirlukast are similar in males and females. Weight-adjusted apparent oral clearance does not differ due to gender.\n- Race:\n- No differences in the pharmacokinetics of zafirlukast due to race have been observed.\n- Elderly:\n- The apparent oral clearance of zafirlukast decreases with age. In patients above 65 years of age, there is an approximately 2-3 fold greater Cmax and AUC compared to young adult patients.\n- Children:\n- Following administration of a single 20 mg dose of zafirlukast to 20 boys and girls between 7 and 11 years of age, and in a second study, to 29 boys and girls between 5 and 6 years of age, the following pharmacokinetic parameters were obtained:\n- Weight unadjusted apparent clearance was 11.4 L/h (42%) in the 7-11 year old children and 9.2 L/h (37%) in the 5-6 year old children, which resulted in greater systemic drug exposures than that obtained in adults for an identical dose. To maintain similar exposure levels in children compared to adults, a dose of 10 mg twice daily is recommended in children 5-11 years of age.\n- Zafirlukast disposition was unchanged after multiple dosing (20 mg twice daily) in children and the degree of accumulation in plasma was similar to that observed in adults.\n- Hepatic Insufficiency: In a study of patients with hepatic impairment (biopsy-proven cirrhosis), there was a reduced clearance of zafirlukast resulting in a 50-60% greater Cmax and AUC compared to normal subjects.\n- Renal Insufficiency: Based on a cross-study comparison, there are no apparent differences in the pharmacokinetics of zafirlukast between renally-impaired patients and normal subjects.\n- Drug-Drug Interactions: The following drug interaction studies have been conducted with zafirlukast  PRECAUTIONS, DRUG INTERACTIONS).\n- Coadministration of multiple doses of zafirlukast (160 mg/day) to steady-state with a single 25 mg dose of warfarin (a substrate of CYP2C resulted in a significant increase in the mean AUC (+63%) and half-life (+36%) of S-warfarin. The mean prothrombin time increased by approximately 35%. The pharmacokinetics of zafirlukast were unaffected by coadministration with warfarin.\n- Coadministration of zafirlukast (80 mg/day) at steady-state with a single dose of a liquid theophylline preparation (6 mg/kg) in 13 asthmatic patients, 18 to 44 years of age, resulted in decreased mean plasma concentrations of zafirlukast by approximately 30%, but no effect on plasma theophylline concentrations was observed.\n- Coadministration of zafirlukast (20 mg/day) or placebo at steady-state with a single dose of sustained release theophylline preparation (16 mg/kg) in 16 healthy boys and girls (6 through 11 years of age) resulted in no significant differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters of theophylline.\n- Coadministration of zafirlukast dosed at 40 mg twice daily in a single-blind, parallel-group, 3-week study in 39 healthy female subjects taking oral contraceptives, resulted in no significant effect on ethinyl estradiol plasma concentrations or contraceptive efficacy.\n- Coadministration of zafirlukast (40 mg/day) with aspirin (650 mg four times daily) resulted in mean increased plasma concentrations of zafirlukast by approximately 45%.\n- Coadministration of a single dose of zafirlukast (40 mg) with erythromycin (500 mg three times daily for 5 days) to steady-state in 11 asthmatic patients resulted in decreased mean plasma concentrations of zafirlukast by approximately 40% due to a decrease in zafirlukast bioavailability.\n- Coadministration of zafirlukast with fluconazole, a moderate CYP2C9 inhibitor, resulted in increased\n- plasma levels of zafirlukast, by approximately 58% (90% CI:28, . The clinical significance of this\n- interaction is unknown. Zafirlukast exposure is likely to be increased by other moderate and strong\n- CYP2C9 inhibitors. Coadministration of zafirlukast with itraconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor,\n- caused no change in plasma levels of zafirlukast.\n\n【44】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\n- In two-year carcinogenicity studies, zafirlukast was administered at dietary doses of 10, 100, and 300 mg/kg to mice and 40, 400, and 2000 mg/kg to rats. Male mice at an oral dose of 300 mg/kg/day (approximately 30 times the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults and in children on a mg/m2 basis) showed an increased incidence of hepatocellular adenomas; female mice at this dose showed a greater incidence of whole body histocytic sarcomas. Male and female rats at an oral dose of 2000 mg/kg/day (resulting in approximately 160 times the exposure to drug plus metabolites from the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults and in children based on a comparison of the plasma area-under the curve  values) of zafirlukast showed an increased incidence of urinary bladder transitional cell papillomas. Zafirlukast was not tumorigenic at oral doses up to 100 mg/kg (approximately 10 times the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults and in children on a mg/m2 basis) in mice and at oral doses up to 400 mg/kg (resulting in approximately 140 times the exposure to drug plus metabolites from the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults and in children based on a comparison of the plasma AUC values) in rats. The clinical significance of these findings for the long-term use of Zafirlukast is unknown.\n- Zafirlukast showed no evidence of mutagenic potential in the reverse microbial assay, in 2 forward point mutation (CHO-HGPRT and mouse lymphoma) assays or in two assays for chromosomal aberrations (the in vitro human peripheral blood lymphocyte clastogenic assay and the in vivo rat bone marrow micronucleus assay).\n- No evidence of impairment of fertility and reproduction was seen in male and female rats treated with zafirlukast at oral doses up to 2000 mg/kg (approximately 410 times the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults on a mg/m2 basis).\n\n【45】 # Clinical Studies\n- Three U.S. double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 13-week clinical trials in 1380 adults and children 12 years of age and older with mild-to-moderate asthma demonstrated that Zafirlukast improved daytime asthma symptoms, nighttime awakenings, mornings with asthma symptoms, rescue beta2-agonist use, FEV1, and morning peak expiratory flow rate. In these studies, the patients had a mean baseline FEV1 of approximately 75% of predicted normal and a mean baseline beta2-agonist requirement of approximately 4-5 puffs of albuterol per day. The results of the largest of the trials are shown in the below.\n- In a second and smaller study, the effect of Zafirlukast on most efficacy parameters was comparable to the active control (inhaled cromolyn sodium 1600 mcg four times per day) and superior to placebo at end point for decreasing rescue beta2-agonist use below).\n- In these trials, improvement in asthma symptoms occurred within one week of initiating treatment with Zafirlukast. The role of Zafirlukast in the management of patients with more severe asthma, patients receiving antiasthma therapy other than as-needed, inhaled beta2-agonists, or as an oral or inhaled corticosteroid-sparing agent remains to be fully characterized.\n\n【46】 # How Supplied\n\n【47】 ## Storage\n- Store at controlled room temperature, 20-25°C (68-77°F).\n- Protect from light and moisture.\n- Dispense in the original air-tight container.\n\n【48】 # Images\n\n【49】 ## Drug Images\n\n【50】 ## Package and Label Display Panel\nNDC 0310-0401-60\n60 ts\nZafirlukast\nZAFIRLUKAST\n10 mg ts\nRx only\nDISPENSE IN THE ORIGINAL\nAIRTIGHT CONTAINER.\nMfd. for: AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP\nWilmington, DE 19850\nBy: IPR Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\nCanóvanas, PR 00729\nProduct of UK\nAstraZeneca\nNDC 0310-0402-60\n60 ts\nZafirlukast\nZAFIRLUKAST\n20 mg ts\nRx only\nDISPENSE IN THE ORIGINAL\nAIRTIGHT CONTAINER.\nMfd. for: AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP\nWilmington, DE 19850\nBy: IPR Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\nCanóvanas, PR 00729\nProduct of UK\nAstraZeneca\n\n【51】 # Patient Counseling Information\n- Patients should be told that a rare side effect of Zafirlukast is hepatic dysfunction, and to contact their physician immediately if they experience symptoms of hepatic dysfunction (eg. right upper quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, fatigue, lethargy, pruritus, jaundice, flu-like symptoms, and anorexia).

Please mail us  to indicate your interest in serving either as an Editor-In-Chief of the entire topic or as an Associate Editor-In-Chief for a subtopic. Please be sure to attach your CV and or biographical sketch.\nPsychosocial development as articulated by Erik Erikson describes eight developmental stages through which a healthily developing human should pass from infancy to late adulthood. In each stage the person confronts, and hopefully masters, new challenges. Each stage builds on the successful completion of earlier stages. The challenges of stages not successfully completed may be expected to reappear as problems in the future.\n\n【1】 # The Stages\n\n【2】 ## Infancy (Birth -18 months)\n- Psychosocial Crisis:  Trust vs. Mistrust\nDeveloping trust is the first task of the ego, and it is never complete. \nThe child will let its mother out of sight without anxiety and rage because she has become an inner certainty as well as an outer predictability. But when a mother is not present, the father becomes the inner certainty along with other relatives usually surrounding the child daily.\nThe balance of trust with mistrust depends largely on the quality of the maternal relationship.\n- Main question asked: Is my environment trustworthy or not?\n- Central Task:  Receiving care\n- Positive Outcome:  Trust in people and the environment\n- Ego Quality:  Hope\n- Definition:  Enduring belief that one can attain one’s deep and essential wishes\n- Developmental Task:  Social attachment; Maturation of sensory, perceptual, and motor functions; Primitive causality.\n- Significant Relations: Maternal parent\nErikson proposed that the concept of trust versus mistrust is present throughout an individual’s entire life.  Therefore if the concept is not addressed, taught and handled properly during infancy (when it is first introduced), the individual may be negatively affected and never fully immerse themselves in the world.   For example, a person may hide themselves from the outside world and be unable to form healthy and long-lasting relationships with others, or even themselves.  If an individual does not learn to trust themselves, others and the world around them then they may lose the virtue of hope, which is directly linked to this concept.  If a person loses their belief in hope they will struggle with overcoming hard times and failures in their lives, and may never fully recover from them. This would prevent them from learning and maturing into a fully-developed person if the concept of trust versus mistrust was improperly learned, understood and used in all aspects of their lives.\n\n【3】 ## Muscular-anal stage (1 1/2 - 3 Years)\n- Psychosocial Crisis: Autonomy vs. Shame & doubt\nIf denied independence, the child will turn against his/her urges to manipulate and discriminate. \t \nShame develops with the child's self-consciousness. \t \nDoubt has to do with having a front and back -- a \"behind\" subject to its own rules. Left over doubt may become paranoia. \t \nThe sense of autonomy fostered in the child and modified as life progresses serves the preservation in economic and political life of a sense of justice.\n- Main question asked: Do I need help from others or not?\nWhen a child reaches the age of one to the age of three, Erikson explains, the child is developing a sense of autonomy . During this age, the toddler discovers he/she is no longer attached to the primary caregiver but is a separate individual (Gonzalez-Mena & Eyer, . Autonomy is the independence a toddler strives for from caregivers. Toddlers’ autonomous behavior is a way of forming their own identity away from their caregivers (Bigner, . This stage is a time where a toddler has the “will” to become independent. Shame and doubt is likely to occur when the toddler is not given any choices or boundaries because the toddler is determined to become independent. The strong will of a toddler may cause conflict between child and caregiver. Many parents are unaware of how to properly handle difficult situations in which they find themselves. Parents who are assertive and too demanding may find themselves in a power struggle with their toddler (Gonzalez-Mena & Eyer, .  In addition, parents may be too demanding for only “good” behavior from their toddler. Gonzalez-Mena and Eyer  explain that demanding good behavior will only cause frustration for the toddler; instead, \"it is far better for the child to see you as a support and an aid rather as an obstacle to his or her own developing capabilities and independence.\" Autonomy can be gained for the toddler when given reasonable choices and proper guidance from the caregiver. Parents can give healthy and wise choices to assist their child to succeed at this stage.\n\n【4】 ## Play Age (3-6 Years)\n- Psychosocial Crisis:  Initiative vs. Guilt\nInitiative adds to autonomy the quality of undertaking, planning, and attacking a task for the sake of being active and on the move. \nThe child is learning to master the world around him or her, learning basic skills and principles of physics; things fall to the ground, not up; round things roll, how to zip and tie, count and speak with ease.\nAt this stage the child wants to begin and complete his or her own actions for a purpose. Guilt is a new emotion and is confusing to the child; he or she may feel guilty over things which are not logically guilt producing, and he or she will feel guilt when his or her initiative does not produce the desired results.\n- Main question asked: How moral am I?\n develop negative behaviors. These behaviors are a result of the child developing a sense of frustration for not being able to achieve his or her goal as planned and may engage in behaviors that seem aggressive, ruthless, and overly assertive to parents; aggressive behaviors, such as throwing objects, hitting, or yelling, are examples of observable behaviors during this stage. With aggressive behaviors as a result of frustration, the child may progress towards developing a sense of guilt for not establishing initiative in the decisions he or she makes and/or not being able to follow through with a set goal. When guilt develops, the child becomes more assertive, aggressive, inhibited, and overly dependent. These characteristics can be seen as far from the norm since the child engages in behaviors that do not show a challenge and/or are comforfor the child; thus, the child does not take on new situations unless assisted by an adult. In concordance with guilt, parents often misjudge the situation and punish or restrict the child too much. However, children in this stage require some sense of guilt in order to guide their self-control and a healthy conscience (Bee and Boyd, .\n\n【5】 ### Importance of adults\nThe relationship between parent and child must include a positive balance between helping the child develop guilt, of which will encourage self-control, and establishing independence for the goals the child chooses. Independence is significant to goal development and child development in that the child will learn to form a foundation for decision-making and in taking the steps required to set goals. As suggested by McDevitt and Ormrod , children establish a positive ability to have self-initiative to set goals through the encouragement and support of their parents and/or teachers. Both parents and/or teachers are crucial aspects in helping a child develop self-initiative to set goals for two reasons: adults can model the self-control that is relevant to setting goals and assist the child with reasoning through making decisions. These components are necessary in that adults help the child establish the foundation of forming a self-initiative to set goals so that the child can progress forward on his or her own in future goal building. If a child decides to construct a large puzzle, the responsibility of reinforcing the child’s capabilities lays upon the supervising adult since the child must take another’s perspective regarding his or her own capabilities; self-perspective may be different in the eyes of others and can produce more honesty than the self can see, especially with children. The adult should not impede instruction, but rather reassure the child through reinforcement that creates intrinsic motivation, such as through positive discussion about the child’s capabilities and sense of worth. McDevitt and Ormrod claim that by observing his or her own accomplishments and/or through the development of self-efficacy, the child internalizes a sense of satisfaction that is necessary for maintaining initiative. However, the child will develop guilt regarding personal needs and desires when he or she, or a supervising adult discourages him or her from completing a goal independently. As a result, the child questions what he or she is actually capable of and may reshape future actions taking initiative and challenging goals, which in turn may not reflect the child’s natural abilities but a more limited repetition.\n\n【6】 ### Importance of responsibility\n be encouraged to use their imaginations when taking initiatives that are related to adult roles, ultimately not feeling guilty for “thinking outside of the box” and being different from the norm as a result. The child should not feel guilty in using imagination during play since it provides him or her with learning how to be creative and to reflecting upon personal capabilities. For example, the child may be imagining he is a police officer and will form his play around this role; this concept could later develop into a future profession, of which the child is willing to take initiative in facing the challenging steps in becoming an actual police officer. Therefore, parents need to provide students with chores and small jobs because it will strengthen skills that reflect responsibility and future adult roles, such as tending to a younger sibling or helping wash dishes. In contrast, children who are not allowed to complete tasks independently may learn that the activities and situations are beyond their ability and they are incapable of setting their own goals. The Child Development Institute LLC  suggests that a child with no responsibility, whether given by an adult or produced by the child, grows fearful in most situations involving change, excessively depends on adults, and is restricted from imagination and active play; these characteristics are a result of the child being immobilized by guilt (i.e. low feelings of self-efficacy, confidence, and frustration in abilities when a personal goal has not been accomplished).\n have the advantage of teaching good morality through discussion and example. By illustrating and discussing how to tolerate guilt, such as feelings of low self-efficacy, self-esteem, or self-confidence after taking initiative in accomplishing a goal, the child will learn that this type of behavior is accep If the child is not given the opportunity to discuss how to accept these feelings that accompany guilt or if the child is simply dealing with guilt reactions, then several questions may arise, such as “Can I do this?,” and “How moral am I?,”. Consistent with these ideas, the Mohonasen Central School District Board of Education  suggests letting children take on small tasks that gradually increase in difficulty as they grow older. This may include helping prepare small meals, setting a , or letting them choose their own clothing for the day; all of which builds confidence and assists in developing simple math skills (e.g. counting and sorting). Finally, allow children with “downtime” as their responsibilities expand. Parents and/or teachers should remember that children in this stage of Erikson’s psychosocial development need and deserve a time to be free.\n\n【7】 ## School Age (7-11 Years)\n- Psychosocial Crisis:  Industry vs. Inferiority\nTo bring a productive situation to completion is an aim which gradually supersedes the whims and wishes of play. \nThe fundamentals of technology are developed. \nTo lose the hope of such \"industrious\" association may pull the child back to the more isolated, less conscious familial rivalry of the oedipal time.\n- Main question asked: Am I good at what I do?\n get to form moral values, recognize cultural and individual differences and are able to manage most of their personal need and grooming with minimal assistance (Allen and Marotz, . At this stage, children might express their independence by being disobedient, using back talk and being rebellious. Children in this stage have to learn the feeling of success. If the child is allowed too little success, he or she will develop a sense of inferiority or incompetence. Too much industry leads to narrow virtuosity (children who are not allowed to be children). A balance between industry and inferiority leads to competency. According to Robert Brooks  parents can nurture self esteem and resilience in different ways:\n\n【8】 ## Adolescence (11-18 Years)\n- Psychosocial Crisis:  Identity vs. Role Confusion\nThe adolescent is newly concerned with how he or she appears to others. Superego identity is the accrued confidence that the outer sameness and continuity prepared in the future are matched by the sameness and continuity of one's meaning for oneself, as evidenced in the promise of a career. The ability to settle on a school or occupational identity is pleasant. In later stages of Adolescence, the child develops a sense of sexual identity.\n\n【9】 ## Young Adulthood (19-40 years)\n- Psychosocial Crisis:  Intimacy vs. Isolation\nBody and ego must be masters of organ modes and of the other nuclear conflicts in order to face the fear of ego loss in situations which call for self-abandon. \nThe avoidance of these experiences leads to openness and self-absorption.\nAccording to Erik Erikson the young adult stage, Intimacy vs. Isolation, is emphasized around the ages of 19 to 34.  At the start of the Intimacy vs. Isolation stage, identity vs. role confusion is coming to an end and it still lingers at the foundation of the stage (Erikson .  Young adults are still eager to blend their identities with friends.  They want to fit in. \n be prepared for rejection, the challenge of break-ups, and isolation, being alone. \nErikson believes we are sometimes isolated due to the above.  We are afraid of rejection; being turned down, our partners breaking up with us.  We are familiar with pain and to some of us rejection is painful, our egos cannot bear the pain.\n argues that “Intimacy has a counterpart: Distantiation: the readiness to isolate and if necessary, to destroy those forces and people whose essence seems dangerous to our own, and whose territory seems to encroach on the extent of one’s intimate relations” \n\n【10】 ## Middle Adulthood (40-65 Years)\n- Psychosocial Crisis:  Generativity vs. Stagnation\nGenerativity is the concern of establishing and guiding the next generation. Socially-valued work and disciplines are expressions of generativity. Simply having or wanting children does not in and of itself achieve generativity.\n\n【11】 ## Late Adulthood (from 65 years)\nPsychosocial crisis: Integrity vs Despair\nwho can look back on good times with gladness, on hard times with self-respect, and on mistakes and regrets with forgiveness, will find a new sense of integrity and a readiness for whatever life or death may bring. A person caught up in old sadness, unable to forgive themselves or others for perceived wrongs, and dissatisfied with the life they've led, will easily drift into depression and despair.\nThe fundamental question is, \"What kind of life have I lived?\"\nA positive outcome of this crisis is achieved if the individual gains a sense of fulfillment about life and a sense of unity within himself and with others. That way, he can accept death with a sense of integrity. Just as a healthy child will not fear life, the healthy adult will not fear death.\nA negative outcome of this crisis causes the individual to despair and fear death.\n\n【12】 # Value of the theory\nOne value of this theory is that it illuminated why individuals who had been thwarted in the healthy resolution of early phases (such as in learning healthy levels of trust and autonomy in toddlerhood) had such difficulty with the crises that came in adulthood. More importantly, it did so in a way that provided answers for practical application. It raised new potential for therapists and their patients to identify key issues and skills that required addressing. But at the same time, it yielded a guide or yardstick that could be used to assess teaching and child rearing practices in terms of their ability to nurture and facilitate healthy emotional and cognitive development.\n\"Every adult, whether he is a follower or a leader, a member of a mass or of an elite, was once a child. He was once small. A sense of smallness forms a substratum in his mind, ineradicably. His triumphs will be measured against this smallness, his defeats will substantiate it. The questions as to who is bigger and who can do or not do this or that, and to whom—these questions fill the adult’s inner life far beyond the necessities and the desirabilities which he understands and for which he plans.\"  - Erik H. Erikson (1904–, U.S. psychoanalyst. Childhood and Society, ch. 11 .\n\n【13】 # Critique\nMost empirical research into Erikson has stemmed around his views on adolescence and attempts to establish identity. His theoretical approach was studied and supported, particularly regarding adolescence, by James E. Marcia. Marcia's work has distinguished different forms of identity, and there is some empirical evidence that those people who form the most coherent self-concept in adolescence are those who are most able to make intimate attachments in early adulthood. This supports Eriksonian theory, in that it suggests that those best equipped to resolve the crisis of early adulthood are those who have most successfully resolved the crisis of adolescence.\nOn the other hand, Erikson's theory may be questioned as to whether his stages must be regarded as sequential, and only occurring within the age ranges he suggests.  There is debate as to whether people only search for identity during the adolescent years or if one stage needs to happen before other stages can be completed.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

These MICs provide estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The MICs should be determined using a standardized procedure. Standardized procedures are based on a dilution method1,2 (broth or agar) or equivalent with standardized inoculum concentrations and standardized concentrations of piperacillin powder. The MIC values should be interpreted according to the following criteria:\nFor testingEnterobacteriaceae  and Acinetobacter  species:\nHaemophilus  species are considered susceptible if the MIC of piperacillin is≤ to 1 μg/mL.*\n- Dilution methods such as those described in the International Collaborative Study (Acta Pathol Microbiol Scand  1971; suppl  have been used to determine susceptibility of organisms to piperacillin.\nDilution (MICs) susceptibility test methods and interpretative criteria for assessing the susceptibility of Neisseria gonorrhoeae to piperacillin have not been established.

A report of “Resistant” indicates that the pathogen is not likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the concentrations usually achievable; other therapy should be selected.\n- Quality Control:\nStandardized susceptibility test procedures require the use of laboratory control microorganisms to control the technical aspects of the laboratory procedures. Standard piperacillin powder should provide the following MIC values:\n- Diffusion Techniques:\n provide reproducible estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. One such standardized procedure2,3 requires the use of standardized inoculum concentrations. This procedure uses paper disks impregnated with 100μg of piperacillin to test the susceptibility of microorganisms to piperacillin.\nReports from the laboratory providing results of the standard single-disk susceptibility test with a 100 μg piperacillin disk should be interpreted according to the following criteria:\nFor testing Enterobacteriaceae and Acinetobacter species:\nHaemophilus species which give zones of ≥ 29 mm are susceptible; resistant strains give zones of ≤ 28 mm. The above interpretive criteria are based on the use of the standardized procedure. Antibiotic susceptibility testing requires carefully prescribed procedures. Susceptibility tests are biased to a considerable degree when different methods are used.\nNCCLS Approved Standard; M2-A2 (Formerly ASM- Performance Standards for Antimicrobic Disk Susceptibility Tests, Second Edition, available from the National Committee of Clinical Laboratory Standards.\nDisk diffusion (zone diameters) susceptibility test methods and interpretative criteria for assessing the susceptibility of Neisseria gonorrhoeae to piperacillin have not been established. However, β-lactamase testing to penicillin is recommended. It will detect one form of penicillin resistance, chromosomally mediated resistance, in Neisseria gonorrhoeae. In addition, gonococci with 10-unit penicillin disk zone diameters of ≤ 19 mm are likely to be β-lactamase producing strains (plasmid-mediated penicillin resistance).2,3\nDisk diffusion (zone diameters) susceptibility test methods and interpretative criteria for assessing the susceptibility of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes  to piperacillin have not been established.2,3\nInterpretation should be as stated above for results using dilution techniques.

There is a Black Box Warning for this drug as shown here.  Common adverse reactions include injection site reactions, somnolence/sedation, dizziness, akathisia, and extrapyramidal disorder.\n\n【4】 # Adult Indications and Dosage\n\n【5】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Adult)\n\n【6】 ## Indications\n- Paliperidone is indicated for the treatment of:\n- Schizophrenia.\n- Schizoaffective disorder as monotherapy and as an adjunct to mood stabilizers or antidepressants.\n\n【7】 ## Dosage\n\n【8】 ### Administration Instructions\n- Each injection must be administered only by a health care professional.\n- Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for foreign matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever product and container permit.\n- Paliperidone (injection) is intended for intramuscular use only. Do not administer by any other route. Avoid inadvertent injection into a blood vessel. Administer the dose in a single injection; do not administer the dose in divided injections. Inject slowly, deep into the muscle.\n- The recommended needle size for administration of Paliperidone (injection) into the deltoid muscle is determined by the patient's weight:\n- For patients weighing less than 90 kg, the 1-inch, 23 gauge needle is recommended.\n- For patients weighing 90 kg or more, the 1½-inch, 22 gauge needle is recommended.\n- Deltoid injections should be alternated between the two deltoid muscles.\n- The recommended needle size for administration of paliperidone (injection) into the gluteal muscle is the 1½-inch, 22 gauge needle regardless of patient weight.\n- Administer into the upper-outer quadrant of the gluteal muscle. Gluteal injections should be alternated between the two gluteal muscles.\n\n【9】 ### Schizophrenia and Schizoaffective Disorder\n- For patients who have never taken oral paliperidone or oral or injecrisperidone, it is recommended to establish tolerability with oral paliperidone or oral risperidone prior to initiating treatment with paliperidone (injection).\n- The recommended dosing of paliperidone (injection) for each approved indication is displayed in  The recommended initiation of paliperidone (injection) is with a dose of 234 mg on treatment day 1 and 156 mg one week later, both administered in the deltoid muscle. Following the second initiation dose, monthly maintenance doses can be administered in either the deltoid or gluteal muscle.\n- Adjustment of the maintenance dose may be made monthly. When making dose adjustments, the prolonged-release characteristics of paliperidone (injection) should be considered, as the full effect of the dose adjustment may not be evident for several months.\n\n【10】 ### Missed Doses\n- Avoiding Missed Doses\n- It is recommended that the second initiation dose of paliperidone (injection) be given one week after the first dose. To avoid a missed dose, patients may be given the second dose 4 days before or after the one-week time point. Similarly, the third and subsequent injections after the initiation regimen are recommended to be given monthly. To avoid a missed monthly dose, patients may be given the injection up to 7 days before or after the monthly time point.\n- Management of a Missed Second Initiation Dose\n- If the target date for the second paliperidone (injection) (one week ± 4 days) is missed, the recommended reinitiation depends on the length of time which has elapsed since the patient's first injection. In case of a missed second initiation dose follow the dosing instructions provided in \n\n【11】 ### Use with Oral Paliperidone or with Risperidone\n- Concomitant use of paliperidone (injection) with oral paliperidone or oral or injecrisperidone has not been studied. Since paliperidone is the major active metabolite of risperidone, consideration should be given to the additive paliperidone exposure if any of these medications are coadministered with paliperidone (injection).\n\n【12】 ### Dosage Adjustments\n- Renal Impairment\n- Paliperidone (injection) has not been systematically studied in patients with renal impairment. For patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min to < 80 mL/min ), initiate paliperidone (injection) with a dose of 156 mg on treatment day 1 and 117 mg one week later. Administer both doses in the deltoid muscle. Thereafter, follow with monthly injections of 78 mg in either the deltoid or gluteal muscle.\n- Paliperidone (injection) is not recommended in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min).\n- Coadministration with Strong CYP3A4/P-glycoprotein (P-gp) Inducers\n- It may be necessary to increase the dose of paliperidone (injection) when a strong inducer of both CYP3A4 and P-gp (e.g., carbamazepine, rifampin, St John's wort) is co-administered. Conversely, on discontinuation of the strong inducer, it may be necessary to decrease the dose of paliperidone (injection).\n\n【13】 ### Switching from Other Antipsychotics\n- There are no systematically collected data to specifically address switching patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder from other antipsychotics to paliperidone (injection), or concerning concomitant administration with other antipsychotics.\n- Switching from Oral Antipsychotics\n- For patients who have never taken oral paliperidone or oral or injecrisperidone, tolerability should be established with oral paliperidone or oral risperidone prior to initiating treatment with paliperidone (injection).\n- Previous oral antipsychotics can be discontinued at the time of initiation of treatment with paliperidone (injection). Recommended initiation of paliperidone (injection) is with a dose of 234 mg on treatment day 1 and 156 mg one week later, both administered in the deltoid muscle. Patients previously stabilized on different doses of INVEGA Extended-Release ts can attain similar paliperidone steady-state exposure during maintenance treatment with paliperidone (injection) monthly doses as depicted in \n- Switching from Long-Acting InjecAntipsychotics\n- For patients who have never taken oral paliperidone or oral or injecrisperidone, tolerability should be established with oral paliperidone or oral risperidone prior to initiating treatment with paliperidone (injection).\n- When switching patients currently at steady-state on a long-acting injecantipsychotic, initiate paliperidone (injection) therapy in place of the next scheduled injection. paliperidone (injection) should then be continued at monthly intervals. The one-week initiation dosing regimen as described in 2 is not required. . The 39 mg strength was not studied in the long-term schizoaffective disorder study. Monthly maintenance doses can be administered in either the deltoid or gluteal muscle.\n- If paliperidone (injection) is discontinued, its prolonged-release characteristics must be considered. As recommended with other antipsychotic medications, the need for continuing existing extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) medication should be re-evaluated periodically.\n\n【14】 ## Off-Label Use and Dosage (Adult)\n\n【15】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\n- There is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Paliperidone (injection) in adult patients.\n\n【16】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n- There is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Paliperidone (injection) in adult patients.\n\n【17】 # Pediatric Indications and Dosage\n\n【18】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Pediatric)\n- Safety and effectiveness of paliperidone (injection) in patients < 18 years of age have not been established.\n\n【19】 ## Off-Label Use and Dosage (Pediatric)\n\n【20】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\n- There is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Paliperidone (injection) in pediatric patients.\n\n【21】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n- There is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Paliperidone (injection) in pediatric patients.\n\n【22】 # Contraindications\n- Paliperidone (injection) is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to either paliperidone or risperidone, or to any of the excipients in the paliperidone (injection) formulation. Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic reactions and angioedema, have been observed in patients treated with risperidone and paliperidone. Paliperidone palmitate is converted to paliperidone, which is a metabolite of risperidone.\n\n【23】 # Warnings\n\n【24】 ## Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis\n- Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Analyses of 17 placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear. Paliperidone (injection) is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis.\n\n【25】 ## Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions, Including Stroke, in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis\n- In placebo-controlled trials with risperidone, aripiprazole, and olanzapine in elderly subjects with dementia, there was a higher incidence of cerebrovascular adverse reactions (cerebrovascular accidents and transient ischemic attacks) including fatalities compared to placebo-treated subjects. Oral paliperidone and paliperidone (injection) were not marketed at the time these studies were performed and are not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis.\n\n【26】 ## Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome\n- A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with antipsychotic drugs, including paliperidone (injection).\n- Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure.\n- The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to identify cases in which the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection, etc.) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever, and primary central nervous system pathology.\n- The management of NMS should inclu\n- If a patient appears to require antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, reintroduction of drug therapy should be closely monitored, since recurrences of NMS have been reported.\n\n【27】 ## QT Prolongation\n be avoided in patients with congenital long QT syndrome and in patients with a history of cardiac arrhythmias.\n- Certain circumstances may increase the risk of the occurrence of Torsades de pointes and/or sudden death in association with the use of drugs that prolong the QTc interval, including  bradycardia;  hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia;  concomitant use of other drugs that prolong the QTc interval; and  presence of congenital prolongation of the QT interval.\n- The effects of oral paliperidone on the QT interval were evaluated in a double-blind, active-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg single dose), multicenter QT study in adults with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder, and in three placebo- and active-controlled 6-week, fixed-dose efficacy trials in adults with schizophrenia.\n- In the QT study (n=, the 8 mg dose of immediate-release oral paliperidone (n= showed a mean placebo-subtracted increase from baseline in QTcLD of 12.3 msec (90% CI: 8.9; 15. on day 8 at 1.5 hours post-dose. The mean steady-state peak plasma concentration for this 8 mg dose of paliperidone immediate release (Cmax ss = 113 ng/mL) was more than 2-fold the exposure observed with the maximum recommended 234 mg dose of paliperidone (injection) administered in the deltoid muscle (predicted median Cmax ss = 50 ng/mL). In this same study, a 4 mg dose of the immediate-release oral formulation of paliperidone, for which Cmax ss = 35 ng/mL, showed an increased placebo-subtracted QTcLD of 6.8 msec (90% CI: 3.6; 10. on day 2 at 1.5 hours post-dose.\n- In the three fixed-dose efficacy studies of oral paliperidone extended release in subjects with schizophrenia, electrocardiogram (ECG) measurements taken at various time points showed only one subject in the oral paliperidone 12 mg group had a change exceeding 60 msec at one time-point on Day 6 (increase of 62 msec).\n had a heart rate of 45 beats per minute.\n\n【28】 ## Tardive Dyskinesia\n- A syndrome of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs. Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to predict which patients will develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown.\n- The risk of developing tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it will become irreversible appear to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient increase, but the syndrome can develop after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses, although this is uncommon.\n- There is no known treatment for established tardive dyskinesia, although the syndrome may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is withdrawn. Antipsychotic treatment itself may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome and may thus mask the underlying process. The effect of symptomatic suppression on the long-term course of the syndrome is unknown.\n- Given these considerations, paliperidone (injection) should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients who suffer from a chronic illness that is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs. In patients who do require chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. The need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically.\n- If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient treated with paliperidone (injection), drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment with paliperidone (injection) despite the presence of the syndrome.\n\n【29】 ## Metabolic Changes\n- Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with metabolic changes that may increase cardiovascular/cerebrovascular risk. These metabolic changes include hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and body weight gain. While all of the drugs in the class have been shown to produce some metabolic changes, each drug has its own specific risk profile.\n\n【30】 ### Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus\n- Hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, have been reported in patients treated with all atypical antipsychotics. These cases were, for the most part, seen in post-marketing clinical use and epidemiologic studies, not in clinical trials, and there have been few reports of hyperglycemia or diabetes in trial subjects treated with paliperidone (injection). Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. Given these confounders, the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions is not completely understood. However, epidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics. Because paliperidone (injection) was not marketed at the time these studies were performed, it is not known if paliperidone (injection) is associated with this risk.\n- Patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on atypical antipsychotics should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients with risk factors for diabetes mellitus (e.g., obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however, some patients required continuation of anti-diabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug.\n- Pooled data from the four placebo-controlled (one 9-week and three 13-week), fixed-dose studies in subjects with schizophrenia are presented in \n- In a long-term open-label pharmacokinetic and safety study in subjects with schizophrenia in which the highest dose available (234 mg) was evaluated, paliperidone (injection) was associated with a mean change in glucose of -0.4 mg/dL at Week 29 (n= and +6.8 mg/dL at Week 53 (n=.\n- During the initial 25-week open-label period of a long-term study in subjects with schizoaffective disorder, paliperidone (injection) was associated with mean change in glucose of +5.3 mg/dL (n=. At the endpoint of the subsequent 15-month double-blind period of the study, paliperidone (injection) was associated with a mean change in glucose of +0.3 mg/dL (n= compared with a mean change of +4.0 mg/dL in the placebo group (n=.\n\n【31】 ### Dyslipidemia\n- Undesirable alterations in lipids have been observed in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics.\n- Pooled data from the four placebo-controlled (one 9-week and three 13-week), fixed-dose studies in subjects with schizophrenia are presented in \n- In a long-term open-label pharmacokinetic and safety study in subjects with schizophrenia in which the highest dose available (234 mg) was evaluated, the mean changes from baseline in lipid values are presented in \n- The mean changes from baseline in lipid values during the initial 25-week open-label period and at the endpoint of the subsequent 15-month double-blind period in a long-term study in subjects with schizoaffective disorder are presented in \n\n【32】 ### Weight Gain\n- Weight gain has been observed with atypical antipsychotic use. Clinical monitoring of weight is recommended.\n- Data on mean changes in body weight and the proportion of subjects meeting a weight gain criterion of ≥ 7% of body weight from the four placebo-controlled (one 9-week and three 13-week), fixed-dose studies in subjects with schizophrenia are presented in \n- In a long-term open-label pharmacokinetic and safety study in which the highest dose available (234 mg) was evaluated, paliperidone (injection) was associated with a mean change in weight of +2.4 kg at Week 29 (n= and +4.3 kg at Week 53 (n=.\n- During the initial 25-week open-label period of a long-term study in subjects with schizoaffective disorder, paliperidone (injection) was associated with a mean change in weight of +2.2 kg and 18.4% of subjects had an increase in body weight of ≥ 7% (n=. At the endpoint of the subsequent 15-month double-blind period of the study, paliperidone (injection) was associated with a mean change in weight of -0.2 kg and 13.0% of subjects had an increase in body weight of ≥ 7% (n=; the placebo group had a mean change in weight of -0.8 kg and 6.0% of subjects had an increase in body weight of ≥ 7% (n=.\n\n【33】 ## Orthostatic Hypotension and Syncope\n- Paliperidone can induce orthostatic hypotension and syncope in some patients because of its alpha-blocking activity. Syncope was reported in < 1% (4/ of subjects treated with paliperidone (injection) in the recommended dose range of 39 mg to 234 mg in the four fixed-dose, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials compared with 0% (0/ of subjects treated with placebo. In the four fixed-dose efficacy studies in subjects with schizophrenia, orthostatic hypotension was reported as an adverse event by < 1% (2/ of paliperidone (injection)-treated subjects compared to 0% (0/ with placebo. Incidences of orthostatic hypotension and syncope in the long-term studies in subjects with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder were similar to those observed in the short-term studies.\n- Paliperidone (injection) should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (e.g., heart failure, history of myocardial infarction or ischemia, conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, or conditions that predispose the patient to hypotension (e.g., dehydration, hypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medications). Monitoring of orthostatic vital signs should be considered in patients who are vulnerable to hypotension.\n\n【34】 ## Leukopenia, Neutropenia, and Agranulocytosis\n been reported.\n- Possible risk factors for leukopenia/neutropenia include pre-existing low white blood cell count (WBC) and history of drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia. Patients with a history of a clinically significant low WBC or a drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia should have their complete blood count (CBC) monitored frequently during the first few months of therapy and discontinuation of paliperidone (injection) should be considered at the first sign of a clinically significant decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors.\n- Patients with clinically significant neutropenia should be carefully monitored for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treated promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count <1000/mm should discontinue paliperidone (injection) and have their WBC followed until recovery.\n\n【35】 ## Hyperprolactinemia\n- Like other drugs that antagonize dopamine D2 receptors, paliperidone elevates prolactin levels and the elevation persists during chronic administration. Paliperidone has a prolactin-elevating effect similar to that seen with risperidone, a drug that is associated with higher levels of prolactin than other antipsychotic drugs.\n- Hyperprolactinemia, regardless of etiology, may suppress hypothalamic GnRH, resulting in reduced pituitary gonadotrophin secretion. This, in turn, may inhibit reproductive function by impairing gonadal steroidogenesis in both female and male patients. Galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported in patients receiving prolactin-elevating compounds. Long-standing hyperprolactinemia when associated with hypogonadism may lead to decreased bone density in both female and male subjects.\n- Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately one-third of human breast cancers are prolactin dependent in vitro, a factor of potential importance if the prescription of these drugs is considered in a patient with previously detected breast cancer. An increase in the incidence of pituitary gland, mammary gland, and pancreatic islet cell neoplasia (mammary adenocarcinomas, pituitary and pancreatic adenomas) was observed in the risperidone carcinogenicity studies conducted in mice and rats. Neither clinical studies nor epidemiologic studies conducted to date have shown an association between chronic administration of this class of drugs and tumorigenesis in humans, but the available evidence is too limited to be conclusive.\n\n【36】 ## Potential for Cognitive and Motor Impairment\n- Somnolence, sedation, and dizziness were reported as adverse reactions in subjects treated with paliperidone (injection). Antipsychotics, including paliperidone (injection), have the potential to impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills. Patients should be cautioned about performing activities requiring mental alertness, such as operating hazardous machinery or operating a motor vehicle, until they are reasonably certain that paliperidone therapy does not adversely affect them.\n\n【37】 ## Seizures\n- In the four fixed-dose double-blind placebo-controlled studies in subjects with schizophrenia, <1% (1/ of subjects treated with paliperidone (injection) in the recommended dose range of 39 mg to 234 mg experienced an adverse event of convulsion compared with <1% (1/ of placebo-treated subjects who experienced an adverse event of grand mal convulsion.\n- Like other antipsychotic drugs, paliperidone (injection) should be used cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or other conditions that potentially lower the seizure threshold. Conditions that lower the seizure threshold may be more prevalent in patients 65 years or older.\n\n【38】 ## Dysphagia\n- Esophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use. Aspiration pneumonia is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with advanced Alzheimer's dementia. Paliperidone (injection) and other antipsychotic drugs should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia.\n\n【39】 ## Priapism\n- Drugs with alpha-adrenergic blocking effects have been reported to induce priapism. Although no cases of priapism have been reported in clinical trials with paliperidone (injection), priapism has been reported with oral paliperidone during postmarketing surveillance. Severe priapism may require surgical intervention.\n\n【40】 ## Disruption of Body Temperature Regulation\n- Disruption of the body's ability to reduce core body temperature has been attributed to antipsychotic agents. Appropriate care is advised when prescribing paliperidone (injection) to patients who will be experiencing conditions which may contribute to an elevation in core body temperature, e.g., exercising strenuously, exposure to extreme heat, receiving concomitant medication with anticholinergic activity, or being subject to dehydration.\n\n【41】 # Adverse Reactions\n\n【42】 ## Clinical Trials Experience\n- The most common (at least 5% in any paliperidone (injection) group) and likely drug-related (adverse events for which the drug rate is at least twice the placebo rate) adverse reactions from the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in subjects with schizophrenia were injection site reactions, somnolence/sedation, dizziness, akathisia, and extrapyramidal disorder. No occurrences of adverse events reached this threshold in the long-term double-blind, placebo-controlled study in subjects with schizoaffective disorder.\n- The data described in this section are derived from a clinical trial database consisting of a total of 3817 subjects (approximately 1705 patient-years exposure) with schizophrenia who received at least one dose of paliperidone (injection) in the recommended dose range of 39 mg to 234 mg and a total of 510 subjects with schizophrenia who received placebo. Among the 3817 paliperidone (injection)-treated subjects, 1293 received paliperidone (injection) in four fixed-dose, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (one 9-week and three 13-week studies), 849 received paliperidone (injection) in the maintenance trial (median exposure 229 days during the initial 33-week open-label phase of this study, of whom 205 continued to receive paliperidone (injection) during the double-blind placebo-controlled phase of this study ), and 1675 received paliperidone (injection) in five non-placebo controlled trials (three noninferiority active-comparator trials, one long-term open-label pharmacokinetic and safety study, and an injection site  cross-over trial). One of the 13-week studies included a 234 mg paliperidone (injection) initiation dose followed by treatment with either 39 mg, 156 mg, or 234 mg every 4 weeks.\n evaluated in a long-term study in adult subjects with schizoaffective disorder. A total of 667 subjects received paliperidone (injection) during the initial 25-week open-label period of this study (median exposure 147 days); 164 subjects continued to receive paliperidone (injection) during the 15-month double-blind placebo-controlled period of this study (median exposure 446 days). Adverse reactions that occurred more frequently in the paliperidone (injection) than the placebo group (a 2% difference or more between groups) were weight increased, nasopharyngitis, headache, hyperprolactinemia, and pyrexia.\n- Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.\n- Commonly Reported Adverse Reactions in Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trials\n-  lists the adverse reactions reported in 2% or more of paliperidone (injection)-treated subjects and at a greater proportion than in the placebo group with schizophrenia in the four fixed-dose, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials.\n\n【43】 ### Other Adverse Reactions Observed During the Clinical Trial Evaluation of Paliperidone (injection)\n- The following list does not include reactions:  already listed in previous s or elsewhere in labeling,  for which a drug cause was remote,  which were so general as to be uninformative, or  which were not considered to have significant clinical implications.\n- Cardiac disorders: atrioventricular block first degree, bradycardia, bundle branch block, palpitations, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, tachycardia\n- Ear and labyrinth disorders: vertigo\n- Eye disorders: eye movement disorder, eye rolling, oculogyric crisis, vision blurred\n- Gastrointestinal disorders: constipation, dyspepsia, flatulence, salivary hypersecretion\n- Immune system disorders: hypersensitivity\n- Investigations: alanine aminotransferase increased, aspartate aminotransferase increased, electrocardiogram abnormal\n- Metabolism and nutrition disorders: decreased appetite, hyperinsulinemia, increased appetite\n- Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: arthralgia, joint stiffness, muscle rigidity, muscle spasms, muscle tightness, muscle twitching, nuchal rigidity\n- Nervous system disorders: bradykinesia, cerebrovascular accident, convulsion, dizziness postural, drooling, dysarthria, dyskinesia, dystonia, hypertonia, lethargy, oromandibular dystonia, parkinsonism, psychomotor hyperactivity, syncope\n- Psychiatric disorders: insomnia, restlessness\n- Reproductive system and breast disorders: amenorrhea, breast discharge, erectile dysfunction, galactorrhea, gynecomastia, menstrual disorder, menstruation delayed, menstruation irregular, sexual dysfunction\n- Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: nasal congestion\n- Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: drug eruption, pruritus, pruritus generalized, rash, urticaria\n\n【44】 ### Discontinuations Due to Adverse Events\n- The percentage of subjects who discontinued due to adverse events in the four fixed-dose, double-blind, placebo-controlled schizophrenia trials were similar for paliperidone (injection)- and placebo-treated subjects.\n- The percentage of subjects who discontinued due to adverse events in the open-label period of the long-term study in subjects with schizoaffective disorder was 7.5%. During the double-blind, placebo-controlled period of that study, the percentages of subjects who discontinued due to adverse events were 5.5% and 1.8% in paliperidone (injection)- and placebo-treated subjects, respectively.\n\n【45】 ### Dose-Related Adverse Reactions\n exhibited a dose relationship, but did not occur at ≥ 2% incidence in paliperidone (injection)-treated subjects from the four fixed-dose studies.\n\n【46】 ### Demographic Differences\n- An examination of population subgroups in the double-blind placebo-controlled trials did not reveal any evidence of differences in safety on the basis of age, gender, or race alone; however, there were few subjects ≥ 65 years of age.\n\n【47】 ### Extrapyramidal Symptoms (EPS)\n- Pooled data from the two double-blind, placebo-controlled, 13-week, fixed-dose trials in adult subjects with schizophrenia provided information regarding EPS. Several methods were used to measure EPS:  the Simpson-Angus global score (mean change from baseline or score at the end of trial) which broadly evaluates Parkinsonism,  the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale global clinical rating score (mean change from baseline or score at the end of trial) which evaluates akathisia,  use of anticholinergic medications to treat EPS,  the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale scores (mean change from baseline or scores at the end of trial) , and  incidence of spontaneous reports of EPS .\n- The results across all phases of the maintenance trial in subjects with schizophrenia exhibited comparable findings. In the 9-week, fixed-dose, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, the proportions of Parkinsonism and akathisia assessed by incidence of rating scales were higher in the paliperidone (injection) 156 mg group (18% and 11%, respectively) than in the paliperidone (injection) 78 mg group (9% and 5%, respectively) and placebo group (7% and 4%, respectively).\n- In the 13-week study in subjects with schizophrenia involving 234 mg initiation dosing, the incidence of any EPS was similar to that of the placebo group (8%), but exhibited a dose-related pattern with 6%, 10%, and 11% in the paliperidone (injection) 234/39 mg, 234/156 mg, and 234/234 mg groups, respectively. Hyperkinesia was the most frequent category of EPS-related adverse events in this study, and was reported at a similar rate between the placebo (4.9%) and paliperidone (injection) 234/156 mg (4.8%) and 234/234 mg (5.5%) groups, but at a lower rate in the 234/39 mg group (1.3%).\n- In the long-term study in subjects with schizoaffective disorder, the EPS during the 25-week open-label paliperidone (injection) treatment were hyperkinesia (12.3%), parkinsonism (8.7%), tremor (3.4%), dyskinesia (2.5%), and dystonia (2.1%). During the 15-month double-blind treatment, the incidence of any EPS was similar to that of the placebo group (8.5% and 7.1% respectively). The most commonly reported treatment-emergent EPS-related adverse events (>2%) in any treatment group in the double-blind phase of the study (paliperidone (injection) versus placebo) were hyperkinesia (3.7% vs. 2.9%), parkinsonism (3.0% vs. 1.8%), and tremor (1.2% vs. 2.4%).\n\n【48】 ### Dystonia\n- Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms inclu\n\n【49】 ### Laboratory Test Abnormalities\n- In the pooled data from the two double-blind, placebo-controlled, 13-week, fixed-dose trials in subjects with schizophrenia, a between-group comparison revealed no medically important differences between paliperidone (injection) and placebo in the proportions of subjects experiencing potentially clinically significant changes in routine serum chemistry, hematology, or urinalysis parameters. Similarly, there were no differences between paliperidone (injection) and placebo in the incidence of discontinuations due to changes in hematology, urinalysis, or serum chemistry, including mean changes from baseline in fasting glucose, insulin, c-peptide, triglycerides, HDL, LDL, and total cholesterol measurements. However, paliperidone (injection) was associated with increases in serum prolactin. The results from the 13-week study involving 234 mg initiation dosing, the 9-week, fixed-dose, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, and the double-blind phase of the maintenance trial in subjects with schizophrenia exhibited comparable findings.\n\n【50】 ### Pain Assessment and Local Injection Site Reactions\n- In the pooled data from the two 13-week, fixed-dose, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in subjects with schizophrenia, the mean intensity of injection pain reported by subjects using a visual analog scale (0 = no pain to 100 = unbearably painful) decreased in all treatment groups from the first to the last injection (placebo: 10.9 to 9.8; 39 mg: 10.3 to 7.7; 78 mg: 10.0 to 9.2; 156 mg: 11.1 to 8.. The results from both the 9-week, fixed-dose, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial and the double-blind phase of the maintenance trial exhibited comparable findings.\n- In the 13-week study involving 234 mg initiation dosing in subjects with schizophrenia, occurrences of induration, redness, or swelling, as assessed by blinded study personnel, were infrequent, generally mild, decreased over time, and similar in incidence between the paliperidone (injection) and placebo groups. Investigator ratings of injection pain were similar for the placebo and paliperidone (injection) groups. Investigator evaluations of the injection site after the first injection for redness, swelling, induration, and pain were rated as absent for 69–100% of subjects in both the paliperidone (injection) and placebo groups. At Day 92, investigators rated absence of redness, swelling, induration, and pain in 95–100% of subjects in both the paliperidone (injection) and placebo groups.\n\n【51】 ### Adverse Reactions Reported in Clinical Trials with Oral Paliperidone\n- The following is a list of additional adverse reactions that have been reported in clinical trials with oral paliperidone:\n- Cardiac disorders: bundle branch block left, sinus arrhythmia\n- Gastrointestinal disorders: abdominal pain, small intestinal obstruction\n- General disorders and administration site conditions: edema, edema peripheral\n- Immune system disorders: anaphylactic reaction\n- Infections and infestations: rhinitis\n- Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: musculoskeletal pain, torticollis, trismus\n- Nervous system disorders: cogwheel rigidity, grand mal convulsion, parkinsonian gait, transient ischemic attack\n- Psychiatric disorders: sleep disorder\n- Reproductive system and breast disorders: breast engorgement, breast tenderness/breast pain, retrograde ejaculation\n- Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: pharyngolaryngeal pain, aspiration pneumonia\n- Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: rash papular\n- Vascular disorders: hypotension, ischemia\n\n【52】 ### Adverse Reactions Reported With Risperidone\n- Paliperidone is the major active metabolite of risperidone. Adverse reactions reported with oral risperidone and risperidone long-acting injection can be found in the ADVERSE REACTIONS sections of the package inserts for those products.\n\n【53】 ## Postmarketing Experience\n- The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of paliperidone; because these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Reactions already listed in other parts of ADVERSE REACTIONS , or those considered in WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  are not listed here.\n- Blood disorders: thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura\n- Gastrointestinal disorders: ileus\n- Genitourinary disorders: urinary incontinence, urinary retention\n- Immune system disorders: angioedema, swollen tongue\n- Cases of anaphylactic reaction after injection with paliperidone (injection) have been reported during postmarketing experience in patients who have previously tolerated oral risperidone or oral paliperidone.\n\n【54】 # Drug Interactions\n\n【55】 ## Potential for Paliperidone (injection) to Affect Other Drugs\n- Paliperidone may antagonize the effect of levodopa and other dopamine agonists.\n- Because of its potential for inducing orthostatic hypotension, an additive effect may occur when paliperidone (injection) is administered with other therapeutic agents that have this potential.\n- No dose adjustment is necessary for lithium when it is coadministered with paliperidone (injection). Pharmacokinetic interaction between paliperidone (injection) and lithium is unlikely.\n- No dose adjustment is necessary for valproate when paliperidone (injection) is added to the therapy. Steady-state pharmacokinetics of valproate was not affected when patients were coadministered oral paliperidone extended-release ts.\n- Paliperidone is not expected to cause clinically important pharmacokinetic interactions with drugs that are metabolized by cytochrome P450 isozymes.\n\n【56】 ## Potential for Other Drugs to Affect Paliperidone (injection)\n- On initiation of strong inducers of both CYP3A4 and P-gp (e.g., carbamazepine, rifampin, or St John's wort), it may be necessary to increase the dose of paliperidone (injection). Conversely, on discontinuation of the strong inducer, it may be necessary to decrease the dose of paliperidone (injection).\n- No dose adjustment is necessary for paliperidone (injection) when valproate is added to treatment.\n- No dose adjustment is necessary for paliperidone (injection) when it is coadministered with lithium. Pharmacokinetic interaction between paliperidone (injection) and lithium is unlikely.\n- In vitro studies indicate that CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 may be involved in paliperidone metabolism; however, there is no evidence in vivo that inhibitors of these enzymes significantly affect the metabolism of paliperidone. Paliperidone is not a substrate of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19; an interaction with inhibitors or inducers of these isozymes is unlikely.\n\n【57】 # Use in Specific Populations\n\n【58】 ### Pregnancy\nPregnancy Category (FDA): C\n\n【59】 ### Risk Summary\n- Adequate and well controlled studies with paliperidone (injection) have not been conducted in pregnant women. Neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs during the third trimester of pregnancy are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery. Paliperidone (injection) should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\n\n【60】 ### Clinical Considerations\n- Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions\n- Monitor neonates exhibiting extrapyramidal or withdrawal symptoms. Some neonates recover within hours or days without specific treatment; others may require prolonged hospitalization.\n- Data\n- Human Data\n- There have been reports of agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, and feeding disorder in neonates following in utero exposure to antipsychotics in the third trimester. These complications have varied in severity; while in some cases symptoms have been self-limited, in other cases neonates have required intensive care unit support and prolonged hospitalization.\n- Animal Data\n- There were no treatment-related effects on the offspring when pregnant rats were injected intramuscularly with paliperidone palmitate during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 250 mg/kg, which is 10 times the maximum recommended human 234 mg dose of paliperidone (injection) on a mg/m2 body surface area basis.\n- In studies in pregnant rats and rabbits in which paliperidone was given orally during the period of organogenesis, there were no increases in fetal abnormalities up to the highest doses tested (10 mg/kg/day in rats and 5 mg/kg/day in rabbits, which are each 8 times the maximum recommended human dose of 12 mg/day of orally administered paliperidone  on a mg/m2 body surface area basis).\n- In rat reproduction studies with risperidone, which is extensively converted to paliperidone in rats and humans, increases in pup deaths were seen at oral doses which are less than the maximum recommended human dose of risperidone on a mg/m2 body surface area basis  RISPERDAL package insert).\nPregnancy Category (AUS): \nThere is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Paliperidone (injection) in women who are pregnant.\n\n【61】 ### Labor and Delivery\n- The effect of paliperidone (injection) on labor and delivery in humans is unknown.\n\n【62】 ### Nursing Mothers\n- In animal studies with paliperidone and in human studies with risperidone, paliperidone was excreted in the milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\n\n【63】 ### Pediatric Use\n- Safety and effectiveness of paliperidone (injection) in patients < 18 years of age have not been established.\n- In a study in which juvenile rats were treated with oral paliperidone from days 24 to 73 of age, a reversible impairment of performance in a test of learning and memory was seen, in females only, with a no-effect dose of 0.63 mg/kg/day, which produced plasma levels (AUC) of paliperidone similar to those in adolescents. No other consistent effects on neurobehavioral or reproductive development were seen up to the highest dose tested (2.5 mg/kg/day), which produced plasma levels of paliperidone 2–3 times those in adolescents.\n- Juvenile dogs were treated for 40 weeks with oral risperidone, which is extensively metabolized to paliperidone in animals and humans, at doses of 0.31, 1.25, or 5 mg/kg/day. Decreased bone length and density were seen with a no-effect dose of 0.31 mg/kg/day, which produced plasma levels (AUC) of risperidone plus paliperidone which were similar to those in children and adolescents receiving the maximum recommended human dose of risperidone. In addition, a delay in sexual maturation was seen at all doses in both males and females. The above effects showed little or no reversibility in females after a 12-week drug-free recovery period.\n- The long-term effects of paliperidone on growth and sexual maturation have not been fully evaluated in children and adolescents.\n\n【64】 ### Geriatic Use\n- Clinical studies of paliperidone (injection) did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.\n- This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney and clearance is decreased in patients with renal impairment, who should be given reduced doses. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, adjust dose based on renal function.\n\n【65】 ### Gender\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Paliperidone (injection) with respect to specific gender populations.\n\n【66】 ### Race\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Paliperidone (injection) with respect to specific racial populations.\n\n【67】 ### Renal Impairment\n- Use of paliperidone (injection) is not recommended in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min). Dose reduction is recommended for patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min to < 80 mL/min).\n\n【68】 ### Hepatic Impairment\n- Paliperidone (injection) has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. Based on a study with oral paliperidone, no dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Paliperidone has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment.\n\n【69】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Paliperidone (injection) in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n\n【70】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\nThere is no FDA guidance one the use of Paliperidone (injection) in patients who are immunocompromised.\n\n【71】 ### 8.8 Patients with Parkinson's Disease or Lewy Body Dementia\n- Patients with Parkinson's Disease or Dementia with Lewy Bodies can experience increased sensitivity to paliperidone (injection). Manifestations can include confusion, obtundation, postural instability with frequent falls, extrapyramidal symptoms, and clinical features consistent with neuroleptic malignant syndrome.\n\n【72】 # Administration and Monitoring\n\n【73】 ### Administration\n- Intramuscular.\n\n【74】 ### Instructions for Use\n\n【75】 ### Monitoring\nThere is limited information regarding Paliperidone (injection) Monitoring in the drug label.\n\n【76】 # IV Compatibility\nThere is limited information regarding the compatibility of Paliperidone (injection) and IV administrations.\n\n【77】 # Overdosage\n\n【78】 ## Human Experience\n- No cases of overdose were reported in premarketing studies with paliperidone (injection). Because paliperidone (injection) is to be administered by health care professionals, the potential for overdosage by patients is low.\n- While experience with paliperidone overdose is limited, among the few cases of overdose reported in premarketing trials with oral paliperidone, the highest estimated ingestion was 405 mg. Observed signs and symptoms included extrapyramidal symptoms and gait unsteadiness. Other potential signs and symptoms include those resulting from an exaggeration of paliperidone's known pharmacological effects, i.e., drowsiness and sedation, tachycardia and hypotension, and QT prolongation. Torsades de pointes and ventricular fibrillation have been reported in a patient in the setting of overdose with oral paliperidone.\n- Paliperidone is the major active metabolite of risperidone. Overdose experience reported with risperidone can be found in the OVERDOSAGE section of the risperidone package insert.\n\n【79】 ## Management of Overdosage\n- Contact a Certified Poison Control Center for the most up to date information on the management of paliperidone (injection) overdosage (1-800-222-1222 or ). Provide supportive care, including close medical supervision and monitoring. Treatment should consist of general measures employed in the management of overdosage with any drug. Consider the possibility of multiple drug overdosage. Ensure an adequate airway, oxygenation, and ventilation. Monitor cardiac rhythm and vital signs. Use supportive and symptomatic measures. There is no specific antidote to paliperidone.\n- Consider the prolonged-release characteristics of paliperidone (injection) and the long apparent half-life of paliperidone when assessing treatment needs and recovery.\n\n【80】 # Pharmacology\n\n【81】 ## Mechanism of Action\n- Paliperidone palmitate is hydrolyzed to paliperidone. Paliperidone is the major active metabolite of risperidone. The mechanism of action of paliperidone is unknown. However, it has been proposed that the drug's therapeutic activity in schizophrenia is mediated through a combination of central dopamine Type 2 (D and serotonin Type 2 (5HT2A) receptor antagonism.\n\n【82】 ## Structure\n- Paliperidone (injection) is an atypical antipsychotic. Paliperidone (injection) contains paliperidone palmitate. The active ingredient, paliperidone palmitate, is a psychotropic agent belonging to the chemical class of benzisoxazole derivatives. Paliperidone (injection) contains a racemic mixture of (+)- and (-)- paliperidone palmitate. The chemical name is (9RS)-3-ethyl]-2-methyl-4-oxo-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-4H-pyridopyrimadin-9-yl hexadecanoate. Its molecular formula is C39H57FN4O4 and its molecular weight is 664.89. The structural formula is:\n- Paliperidone palmitate is very slightly soluble in ethanol and methanol, practically insoluble in polyethylene glycol 400 and propylene glycol, and slightly soluble in ethyl acetate.\n- Paliperidone (injection) is available as a white to off-white sterile aqueous extended-release suspension for intramuscular injection in the following dose strengths of paliperidone palmitate (and deliverable volumes of the prefilled syringes): 39 mg (0.25 mL), 78 mg (0.5 mL), 117 mg (0.75 mL), 156 mg (1.0 mL), and 234 mg (1.5 mL). The drug product hydrolyzes to the active moiety, paliperidone, resulting in dose strengths of 25 mg, 50 mg, 75 mg, 100 mg, and 150 mg of paliperidone, respectively. The inactive ingredients are polysorbate 20 (12 mg/mL), polyethylene glycol 4000 (30 mg/mL), citric acid monohydrate (5 mg/mL), disodium hydrogen phosphate anhydrous, sodium dihydrogen phosphate monohydrate, sodium hydroxide, and water for injection.\n contains 2 safety needles (a 1 ½-inch 22 gauge safety needle and a 1-inch 23 gauge safety needle).\n\n【83】 ## Pharmacodynamics\n active as an antagonist at α1 and α2 adrenergic receptors and H1 histaminergic receptors, which may explain some of the other effects of the drug. Paliperidone has no affinity for cholinergic muscarinic or β1- and β2-adrenergic receptors. The pharmacological activity of the (+)- and (-)- paliperidone enantiomers is qualitatively and quantitatively similar in vitro.\n\n【84】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n- Absorption and Distribution\n- Due to its extremely low water solubility, paliperidone palmitate dissolves slowly after intramuscular injection before being hydrolyzed to paliperidone and absorbed into the systemic circulation. Following a single intramuscular dose, the plasma concentrations of paliperidone gradually rise to reach maximum plasma concentrations at a median Tmax of 13 days. The release of the drug starts as early as day 1 and lasts for as long as 126 days.\n- Following intramuscular injection of single doses (39 mg – 234 mg) in the deltoid muscle, on average, a 28% higher Cmax was observed compared with injection in the gluteal muscle. The two initial deltoid intramuscular injections of 234 mg on day 1 and 156 mg on day 8 help attain therapeutic concentrations rapidly. The release profile and dosing regimen of paliperidone (injection) results in sustained therapeutic concentrations. The AUC of paliperidone following paliperidone (injection) administration was dose-proportional over a 39 mg–234 mg dose range, and less than dose-proportional for Cmax for doses exceeding 78 mg. The mean steady-state peak:trough ratio for an paliperidone (injection) dose of 156 mg was 1.8 following gluteal administration and 2.2 following deltoid administration.\n- Following administration of paliperidone palmitate the (+) and (-) enantiomers of paliperidone interconvert, reaching an AUC (+) to (-) ratio of approximately 1.6–1.8.\n- Based on a population analysis, the apparent volume of distribution of paliperidone is 391 L. The plasma protein binding of racemic paliperidone is 74%.\n- Metabolism and Elimination\n- In a study with oral immediate-release 14C-paliperidone, one week following administration of a single oral dose of 1 mg immediate-release 14C-paliperidone, 59% of the dose was excreted unchanged into urine, indicating that paliperidone is not extensively metabolized in the liver. Approximately 80% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in urine and 11% in the feces. Four metabolic pathways have been identified in vivo, none of which accounted for more than 10% of the dose: dealkylation, hydroxylation, dehydrogenation, and benzisoxazole scission. Although in vitro studies suggested a role for CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 in the metabolism of paliperidone, there is no evidence in vivo that these isozymes play a significant role in the metabolism of paliperidone. Population pharmacokinetics analyses indicated no discernible difference on the apparent clearance of paliperidone after administration of oral paliperidone between extensive metabolizers and poor metabolizers of CYP2D6 substrates.\n- The median apparent half-life of paliperidone following paliperidone (injection) single-dose administration over the dose range of 39 mg – 234 mg ranged from 25 days – 49 days.\n- Long-Acting Paliperidone Palmitate Injection versus Oral Extended-Release Paliperidone\n- Paliperidone (injection) is designed to deliver paliperidone over a monthly period while extended-release oral paliperidone is administered on a daily basis. The initiation regimen for paliperidone (injection) (234 mg/156 mg in the deltoid muscle on Day 1/Day  was designed to rapidly attain steady-state paliperidone concentrations when initiating therapy without the use of oral supplementation.\n- In general, overall initiation plasma levels with paliperidone (injection) were within the exposure range observed with 6–12 mg extended-release oral paliperidone. The use of the paliperidone (injection) initiation regimen allowed patients to stay in this exposure window of 6–12 mg extended-release oral paliperidone even on trough pre-dose days (Day 8 and Day . The intersubject variability for paliperidone pharmacokinetics following delivery from paliperidone (injection) was lower relative to the variability determined from extended-release oral paliperidone ts. Because of the difference in median pharmacokinetic profiles between the two products, caution should be exercised when making a direct comparison of their pharmacokinetic properties.\n- Drug Interaction Studies\n- Potential for paliperidone (injection) to Affect Other Drugs\n not expected to have enzyme inducing properties.\n- Paliperidone is a weak inhibitor of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) at high concentrations. No in vivo data are available, and the clinical relevance is unknown.\n- In a drug interaction study, co-administration of oral paliperidone extended-release ts (12 mg once daily for 5 days) with divalproex sodium extended-release ts (500 mg to 2000 mg once daily) did not affect the steady-state pharmacokinetics (AUC24h and Cmax,ss) of valproate in 13 patients stabilized on valproate. In a clinical study, subjects on sdoses of valproate had comparable valproate average plasma concentrations when oral paliperidone extended-release ts 3–15 mg/day was added to their existing valproate treatment.\n- Potential for Other Drugs to Affect paliperidone (injection)\n- While in vitro studies indicate that CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 may be minimally involved in paliperidone metabolism, in vivo studies did not demonstrate decreased elimination by these isozymes; they contribute to only a small fraction of total body clearance. In vitro studies demonstrated that paliperidone is a P-gp substrate.\n- Co-administration of oral paliperidone extended-release 6 mg once daily with carbamazepine, a strong inducer of both CYP3A4 and P-gp, at 200 mg twice daily caused a decrease of approximately 37% in the mean steady-state Cmax and AUC of paliperidone. This decrease is caused, to a substantial degree, by a 35% increase in renal clearance of paliperidone. A minor decrease in the amount of drug excreted unchanged in the urine suggests that there was little effect on the CYP metabolism or bioavailability of paliperidone during carbamazepine co-administration.\n- Co-administration of a single dose of oral paliperidone extended-release 12 mg t with divalproex sodium extended-release ts (two 500 mg ts once daily at steady-state) resulted in an increase of approximately 50% in the Cmax and AUC of paliperidone. Although this interaction has not been studied with paliperidone (injection), a clinically significant interaction would not be expected between divalproex sodium and paliperidone (injection) intramuscular injection.\n- Paliperidone is metabolized to a limited extent by CYP2D6. In an interaction study in healthy subjects in which a single 3 mg dose of oral paliperidone extended-release was administered concomitantly with 20 mg per day of paroxetine (a potent CYP2D6 inhibitor), paliperidone exposures were on average 16% (90% CI: 4,  higher in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers. Higher doses of paroxetine have not been studied. The clinical relevance is unknown.\n- Specific Populations\n- Renal Impairment\n- Paliperidone (injection) has not been systematically studied in patients with renal impairment. Based on a limited number of observations with paliperidone (injection) in subjects with mild renal impairment and pharmacokinetic simulations, the dose of paliperidone (injection) should be reduced in patients with mild renal impairment; paliperidone (injection) is not recommended in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment. Although paliperidone (injection) was not studied in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment, the disposition of a single oral dose paliperidone 3 mg extended-release t was studied in subjects with varying degrees of renal function. Elimination of paliperidone decreased with decreasing estimated creatinine clearance. Total clearance of paliperidone was reduced in subjects with impaired renal function by 32% on average in mild (CrCl = 50 mL/min to < 80 mL/min), 64% in moderate (CrCl = 30 mL/min to < 50 mL/min), and 71% in severe (CrCl = 10 mL/min to < 30 mL/min) renal impairment, corresponding to an average increase in exposure (AUCinf) of 1.5 fold, 2.6 fold, and 4.8 fold, respectively, compared to healthy subjects.\n- Hepatic Impairment\n- Paliperidone (injection) has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. Based on a study with oral paliperidone in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B), no dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. In the study with oral paliperidone in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B), the plasma concentrations of free paliperidone were similar to those of healthy subjects, although total paliperidone exposure decreased because of a decrease in protein binding. Paliperidone has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment.\n- Elderly\n- No dosage adjustment is recommended based on age alone. However, dose adjustment may be required because of age-related decreases in creatinine clearance.\n- Race\n- No dosage adjustment is recommended based on race. No differences in pharmacokinetics were observed between Japanese and Caucasians.\n- Gender\n- No dosage adjustment is recommended based on gender, although slower absorption was observed in females in a population pharmacokinetic analysis.\n- Smoking\n- No dosage adjustment is recommended based on smoking status. Based on in vitro studies utilizing human liver enzymes, paliperidone is not a substrate for CYP1A2; smoking should, therefore, not have an effect on the pharmacokinetics of paliperidone.\n\n【85】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\n\n【86】 ### Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\n- Carcinogenesis\n- The carcinogenic potential of intramuscularly injected paliperidone palmitate was assessed in rats. There was an increase in mammary gland adenocarcinomas in female rats at 16, 47, and 94 mg/kg/month, which is 0.6, 2, and 4 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human 234 mg dose of paliperidone (injection) on a mg/m2 body surface area basis. A no-effect dose was not established. Male rats showed an increase in mammary gland adenomas, fibroadenomas, and carcinomas at 47 mg and 94 mg/kg/month. A carcinogenicity study in mice has not been conducted with paliperidone palmitate.\n- Carcinogenicity studies of risperidone, which is extensively converted to paliperidone in rats, mice, and humans, were conducted in Swiss albino mice and Wistar rats. Risperidone was administered in the diet at daily doses of 0.63, 2.5, and 10 mg/kg for 18 months to mice and for 25 months to rats. A maximum tolerated dose was not achieved in male mice. There were statistically significant increases in pituitary gland adenomas, endocrine pancreas adenomas, and mammary gland adenocarcinomas. The no-effect dose for these tumors was less than or equal to the maximum recommended human dose of risperidone on a mg/m2 body surface area basis  RISPERDAL package insert). An increase in mammary, pituitary, and endocrine pancreas neoplasms has been found in rodents after chronic administration of other antipsychotic drugs and is considered to be mediated by prolonged dopamine D2-receptor antagonism and hyperprolactinemia. The relevance of these tumor findings in rodents in terms of human risk is unknown.\n- Mutagenesis\n- Paliperidone palmitate showed no genotoxic potential in the Ames reverse mutation test or the mouse lymphoma assay. No evidence of genotoxic potential for paliperidone was found in the Ames reverse mutation test, the mouse lymphoma assay, or the in vivo rat micronucleus test.\n- Impairment of Fertility\n- Fertility studies of paliperidone palmitate have not been performed.\n caused slight maternal toxicity. These parameters were not affected at a dose of 0.63 mg/kg, which is half of the maximum recommended human dose (12 mg/day) of orally administered paliperidone (INVEGA) on a mg/m2 body surface area basis.\n- The fertility of male rats was not affected at oral doses of paliperidone of up to 2.5 mg/kg/day, although sperm count and sperm viability studies were not conducted with paliperidone. In a subchronic study in Beagle dogs with risperidone, which is extensively converted to paliperidone in dogs and humans, all doses tested (0.31 mg/kg – 5.0 mg/kg) resulted in decreases in serum testosterone and in sperm motility and concentration. Serum testosterone and sperm parameters partially recovered, but remained decreased after the last observation (two months after treatment was discontinued).\n\n【87】 # Clinical Studies\n\n【88】 ## Schizophrenia\n\n【89】 ### Short-Term Monotherapy (Studies 1, 2, 3, \n- The efficacy of paliperidone (injection) in the acute treatment of schizophrenia was evaluated in four short-term (one 9-week and three 13-week) double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose studies of acutely relapsed adult inpatients who met DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia. The fixed doses of paliperidone (injection) in these studies were given on days 1, 8, and 36 in the 9-week study, and additionally on day 64 of the 13-week studies, i.e., at a weekly interval for the initial two doses and then every 4 weeks for maintenance.\n- Efficacy was evaluated using the total score on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). The PANSS is a 30 item scale that measures positive symptoms of schizophrenia (7 items), negative symptoms of schizophrenia (7 items), and general psychopathology (16 items), each rated on a scale of 1 (absent) to 7 (extreme); total PANSS scores range from 30 to 210.\n- In Study 1 (PSY-, a 13-week study (n= comparing three fixed doses of paliperidone (injection) (initial deltoid injection of 234 mg followed by 3 gluteal or deltoid doses of either 39 mg/4 weeks, 156 mg/4 weeks or 234 mg/4 weeks) to placebo, all three doses of paliperidone (injection) were superior to placebo in improving the PANSS total score.\n- In Study 2 (PSY-, another 13-week study (n= comparing three fixed doses of paliperidone (injection) (78 mg/4 weeks, 156 mg/4 weeks, and 234 mg/4 weeks) to placebo, only 156 mg/4 weeks of paliperidone (injection) was superior to placebo in improving the PANSS total score.\n- In Study 3 (PSY-, a third 13-week study (n= comparing three fixed doses of paliperidone (injection) (39 mg/4 weeks, 78 mg/4 weeks, and 156 mg/4 weeks) to placebo, all three doses of paliperidone (injection) were superior to placebo in improving the PANSS total score.\n- In Study 4 (SCH-, the 9-week study (n= comparing two fixed doses of paliperidone (injection) (78 mg/4 weeks and 156 mg/4 weeks) to placebo, both doses of paliperidone (injection) were superior to placebo in improving PANSS total score.\n- A summary of the mean baseline PANSS scores along with the mean changes from baseline in the four short-term acute schizophrenia studies are provided in \n\n【90】 ### Maintenance Monotherapy Treatment (Study 5: PSY-\n- The efficacy of paliperidone (injection) in maintaining symptomatic control in schizophrenia was established in a longer-term double-blind, placebo-controlled, flexible-dose study involving adult subjects who met DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia. This study included a minimum 12-week, fixed-dose stabilization phase, and a randomized, placebo-controlled phase to observe for relapse. During the double-blind phase, patients were randomized to either the same dose of paliperidone (injection) they received during the stabilization phase, i.e., 39 mg, 78 mg, or 156 mg administered every 4 weeks, or to placebo. A total of 410 stabilized patients were randomized to either paliperidone (injection) or to placebo until they experienced a relapse of schizophrenia symptoms. Relapse was pre-defined as time to first emergence of one or more of the following: psychiatric hospitalization, ≥ 25% increase (if the baseline score was >  or a 10-point increase (if the baseline score was ≤  in total PANSS score on two consecutive assessments, deliberate self-injury, violent behavior, suicidal/homicidal ideation, or a score of ≥ 5 (if the maximum baseline score was ≤  or ≥ 6 (if the maximum baseline score was  on two consecutive assessments of the specific PANSS items. The primary efficacy variable was time to relapse. A pre-planned interim analysis showed a statistically significantly longer time to relapse in patients treated with paliperidone (injection) compared to placebo, and the study was stopped early because maintenance of efficacy was demonstrated. Thirty-four percent (34%) of subjects in the placebo group and 10% of subjects in the paliperidone (injection) group experienced a relapse event. There was a statistically significant difference between the treatment groups in favor of paliperidone (injection). A Kaplan-Meier plot of time to relapse by treatment group is shown in  The time to relapse for subjects in the placebo group was statistically significantly shorter than for the paliperidone (injection) group. An examination of population subgroups did not reveal any clinically significant differences in responsiveness on the basis of gender, age, or race.\n\n【91】 ## Schizoaffective Disorder\n\n【92】 ### Maintenance Treatment – Monotherapy and as Adjunct to Mood Stabilizer or Antidepressant (SAff Study 1: SCA-\n- The efficacy of paliperidone (injection) in maintaining symptom control in schizoaffective disorder was established in a long-term double-blind, placebo-controlled, flexible-dose randomized-withdrawal study designed to delay relapse in adult subjects who met DSM-IV criteria for schizoaffective disorder, as confirmed by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Disorders. The population included subjects with schizoaffective bipolar and depressive types. Subjects received paliperidone (injection) either as monotherapy or as an adjunct to sdoses of antidepressant or mood stabilizers.\n- This study included a 13-week, open-label, flexible-dose (paliperidone (injection) 78 mg, 117 mg, 156 mg, or 234 mg) lead-in period which enrolled a total of 667 subjects who had  acute exacerbation of psychotic symptoms;  score ≥4 on ≥3 PANSS items of delusions, conceptual disorganization, hallucinatory behavior, excitement, suspiciousness/persecution, hostility, uncooperativeness, tension, and poor impulse control; and  prominent mood symptoms ≥16 on the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) and/or the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, 21-item version (HAM-D-. Subjects were 19 to 66 years old (mean 39.5 years) and 53.5% were male. The mean scores at open-label enrollment of PANSS total was 85.8 (range 42 to , HAM-D-21 was 20.4 (range 3 to , YMRS was 18.6 (range 0 to , and CGI-S-SCA was 4.4 (range 2 to .\n- After the 13-week open-label flexible-dose paliperidone (injection) treatment, 432 subjects met stabilization criteria (PANSS total score ≤70, YMRS ≤12, and HAM-D-21 ≤ and continued into the 12-week open-label fixed-dose stabilization period.\n- A total of 334 subjects who met stabilization criteria for 12 consecutive weeks were randomized (1: to continue the same dose of paliperidone (injection) or to placebo in the 15-month, double-blind, maintenance period. For the 164 subjects who were randomized to paliperidone (injection), dose distribution was 78 mg (4.9%), 117 mg (9.8%), 156 mg (47.0%), and 234 mg (38.4%). The primary efficacy variable was time to relapse. Relapse was defined as the first occurrence of one or more of the following:  psychiatric hospitalization;  intervention employed to avert hospitalization;  clinically significant self-injury, suicidal or homicidal ideation or violent behavior;  a score of ≥6 (if the score was ≤4 at randomization) of any of the individual PANSS items: delusions, conceptual disorganization, hallucinatory behavior, excitement, suspiciousness/persecution, hostility, uncooperativeness, or poor impulse control;  on two consecutive assessments within 7 days: ≥25% increase (if the score at randomization was > or ≥10-point increase (if the score at randomization was ≤ in total PANSS score; a score of ≥5 (if the score was ≤3 at randomization) of any of the individual PANSS items: delusions, conceptual disorganization, hallucinatory behavior, excitement, suspiciousness/persecution, hostility, uncooperativeness, or poor impulse control; an increase of ≥2 points (if the score was 1  to 3  at randomization) or increase of ≥1 point (if the score was ≥4  at randomization) in CGI-S-SCA overall score.\n- There was a statistically significant difference in time to relapse between the treatment groups in favor of paliperidone (injection). A Kaplan-Meier plot of time to relapse by treatment group is shown in \n\n【93】 # How Supplied\n- Paliperidone (injection) is available as a white to off-white sterile aqueous extended-release suspension for intramuscular injection in dose strengths of 39 mg, 78 mg, 117 mg, 156 mg, and 234 mg paliperidone palmitate.

Common adverse reactions include oily spotting, flatus with discharge,fecal urgency,fatty/oily stool,oily evacuation,\nincreased defecation, fecal incontinence, abdominal pain/discomfort, nausea,  influenza, back pain, rash.\n\n【3】 # Adult Indications and Dosage\n\n【4】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Adult)\n\n【5】 # Indications\n indicated to reduce the risk for weight regain after prior weight loss. Orlistat is indicated for obese patients with an initial body mass index (BMI) ≥30 kg/m2 or ≥27 kg/m2 in the presence of other risk factors (e.g., hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia).\n- TABLE 1 illustrates body mass index (BMI) according to a variety of weights and heights. The BMI is calculated by dividing weight in kilograms by height in meters squared. For example, a person who weighs 180 lbs and is 5'5\" would have a BMI of 30.\n\n【6】 # Dosing\n- The recommended dose of Orlistat is one 120-mg capsule three times a day with each main meal containing fat (during or up to 1 hour after the meal).\n- The patient should be on a nutritionally balanced, reduced-calorie diet that contains approximately 30% of calories from fat. The daily intake of fat, carbohydrate, and protein should be distributed over three main meals. If a meal is occasionally missed or contains no fat, the dose of orlistat can be omitted.\n- Because orlistat has been shown to reduce the absorption of some fat-soluble vitamins and beta-carotene, patients should be counseled to take a multivitamin containing fat-soluble vitamins to ensure adequate nutrition. The vitamin supplement should be taken at least 2 hours before or after the administration of orlistat, such as at bedtime.\n- For patients receiving both orlistat and cyclosporine therapy, administer cyclosporine 3 hours after orlistat.\n- For patients receiving both orlistat and levothyroxine therapy, administer levothyroxine and orlistat at least 4 hours apart. Patients treated concomitantly with orlistat and levothyroxine should be monitored for changes in thyroid function.\n- Doses above 120 mg three times a day have not been shown to provide additional benefit.\n- Based on fecal fat measurements, the effect of orlistat is seen as soon as 24 to 48 hours after dosing. Upon discontinuation of therapy, fecal fat content usually returns to pretreatment levels within 48 to 72 hours.\n\n【7】 # DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS\n- Orlistat 120 mg turquoise capsules imprinted with ROCHE and orlistat 120 in black ink.\n\n【8】 ## Off-Label Use and Dosage (Adult)\n\n【9】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\n\n【10】 # Indications and  Dosing\n- Concomitant nutritionally-balanced meal with 30% calories from fat is recommended\n- Concomitant daily multivitamin supplement is recommended\n- Obesity: 120 mg orally 3 times daily during or within 1 hour of each fat-containing meal\n- Obesity: over-the-counter dose: 60 mg ORALLY 3 times daily during or within 1 hour of each fat-containing meal\n\n【11】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Orlistat in adult patients.\n\n【12】 # Pediatric Indications and Dosage\n\n【13】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Pediatric)\nThere is limited information regarding Orlistat FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Pediatric) in the drug label.\n\n【14】 ## Off-Label Use and Dosage (Pediatric)\n\n【15】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\n\n【16】 # Indications and Dosing\n- Concomitant nutritionally-balanced meal with 30% calories from fat is recommended.\n- Concomitant daily multivitamin supplement is recommended.\n- Obesity: (12 to 16 years) 120 mg ORALLY 3 times daily during or within 1 hour of each fat-containing meal.\n\n【17】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Orlistat in pediatric patients.\n\n【18】 # Contraindications\n- Pregnancy\n- Patients with chronic malabsorption syndrome\n- Patients with cholestasis\n- Patients with known hypersensitivity to orlistat or to any component of this product\n\n【19】 # Warnings\n\n【20】 # Concomitant Drug and Vitamin Use\n- Data from a orlistat and cyclosporine drug interaction study indicate a reduction in cyclosporine plasma levels when orlistat was coadministered with cyclosporine. Therefore, orlistat and cyclosporine should not be simultaneously coadministered. To reduce the chance of a drug-drug interaction, cyclosporine should be taken at least 3 hours before or after orlistat in patients taking both drugs. In addition, in those patients whose cyclosporine levels are being measured, more frequent monitoring should be considered.\n- Patients should be strongly encouraged to take a multivitamin supplement that contains fat-soluble vitamins to ensure adequate nutrition because orlistat has been shown to reduce the absorption of some fat-soluble vitamins and beta-carotene. In addition, the levels of vitamin D and beta-carotene may be low in obese patients compared with non-obese subjects. The supplement should be taken once a day at least 2 hours before or after the administration of orlistat, such as at bedtime.\n- TABLE 2 illustrates the percentage of adult patients on orlistat and placebo who developed a low vitamin level on two or more consecutive visits during 1 and 2 years of therapy in studies in which patients were not previously receiving vitamin supplementation.\n- TABLE 3 illustrates the percentage of adolescent patients on orlistat and placebo who developed a low vitamin level on two or more consecutive visits during the 1-year study.\n- Weight-loss may affect glycemic control in patients with diabetes mellitus. A reduction in dose of oral hypoglycemic medication (e.g., sulfonylureas) or insulin may be required in some patients\n\n【21】 # Liver Injury\n- There have been rare postmarketing reports of severe liver injury with hepatocellular necrosis or acute hepatic failure in patients treated with orlistat, with some of these cases resulting in liver transplant or death. Patients should be instructed to report any symptoms of hepatic dysfunction (anorexia, pruritus, jaundice, dark urine, light-colored stools, or right upper quadrant pain) while taking orlistat. When these symptoms occur, orlistat and other suspect medications should be discontinued immediately and liver function tests and ALT and AST levels obtained.\n\n【22】 # Increases in Urinary Oxalate\n- Some patients may develop increased levels of urinary oxalate following treatment with orlistat. Cases of oxalate nephrolithiasis and oxalate nephropathy with renal failure have been reported. Monitor renal function when prescribing orlistat to patients at risk for renal impairment and use with caution in those with a history of hyperoxaluria or calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis.\n\n【23】 # Cholelithiasis\nSubstantial weight loss can increase the risk of cholelithiasis. In a clinical trial of orlistat for the prevention of type 2 diabetes, the rates of cholelithiasis as an adverse event were 2.9% (47/ for patients randomized to orlistat and 1.8% (30/ for patients randomized to placebo.\n\n【24】 # Miscellaneous\n- Organic causes of obesity (e.g., hypothyroidism) should be excluded before prescribing orlistat.\n- Patients should be advised to adhere to dietary guidelines. Gastrointestinal events  may increase when orlistat is taken with a diet high in fat (>30% total daily calories from fat). The daily intake of fat should be distributed over three main meals. If orlistat is taken with any one meal very high in fat, the possibility of gastrointestinal effects increases.\n\n【25】 # Adverse Reactions\n\n【26】 ## Clinical Trials Experience\n\n【27】 # Clinical Trials\n- Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in patients.\n- Commonly Observed (based on first year and second year data)\n- Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms were the most commonly observed treatment-emergent adverse events associated with the use of orlistat in the seven double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials and are primarily a manifestation of the mechanism of action. (Commonly observed is defined as an incidence of ≥5% and an incidence in the orlistat 120 mg group that is at least twice that of placebo.)\nIn general, the first occurrence of these events was within 3 months of starting therapy. Overall, approximately 50% of all episodes of GI adverse events associated with orlistat treatment lasted for less than 1 week, and a majority lasted for no more than 4 weeks. However, GI adverse events may occur in some individuals over a period of 6 months or longer.\nDiscontinuation of Treatment\nIn controlled clinical trials, 8.8% of patients treated with orlistat discontinued treatment due to adverse events, compared with 5.0% of placebo-treated patients. For orlistat, the most common adverse events resulting in discontinuation of treatment were gastrointestinal.\nOther Adverse Clinical Events\nThe following lists other treatment-emergent adverse events from seven multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials that occurred at a frequency of ≥2% among patients treated with orlistat 120 mg three times a day and with an incidence that was greater than placebo during year 1 and year 2, regardless of relationship to study medication.\nIn the 4-year XENDOS study, the general pattern of adverse events was similar to that reported for the 1- and 2-year studies with the total incidence of gastrointestinal-related adverse events occurring in year 1 decreasing each year over the 4-year period.\n observed.\nPediatric Patients\nIn clinical trials with orlistat in adolescent patients ages 12 to 16 years, the profile of adverse reactions was generally similar to that observed in adults.\n\n【28】 ## Postmarketing Experience\nThe following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of orlistat. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to orlistat exposure.\n- Rare cases of increase in transaminases and in alkaline phosphatase and hepatitis that may be serious have been reported. There have been reports of hepatic failure observed with the use of orlistat in postmarketing surveillance, with some of these cases resulting in liver transplant or death.\n- Cases of reduced concentrations of cyclosporine have been reported when cyclosporine was co-administered with orlistat.\n- Rare cases of hypersensitivity have been reported with the use of orlistat. Signs and symptoms have included pruritus, rash, urticaria, angioedema, bronchospasm and anaphylaxis. Very rare cases of bullous eruption have been reported.\n- Reports of decreased prothrombin, increased INR and unbalanced anticoagulant treatment resulting in change of hemostatic parameters have been reported in patients treated concomitantly with orlistat and anticoagulants.\n- Hypothyroidism has been reported in patients treated concomitantly with orlistat and levothyroxine.\n- Acute oxalate nephropathy after treatment with orlistat has been reported in patients with or at risk for renal disease.\n- Pancreatitis has been reported with the use of orlistat in postmarketing surveillance. No causal relationship or physiopathological mechanism between pancreatitis and obesity therapy has been definitively established.\n- Lower gastrointestinal bleeding has been reported in patients treated with orlistat. Most reports are non serious; severe or persistent cases should be investigated further.\n- Convulsions have been reported in patients treated concomitantly with orlistat and antiepileptic drugs.\n\n【29】 # Drug Interactions\nCyclosporine\nData from a orlistat and cyclosporine drug interaction study indicate a reduction in cyclosporine plasma levels when orlistat was coadministered with cyclosporine. Orlistat and cyclosporine should not be simultaneously coadministered. Cyclosporine should be administered 3 hours after the administration of orlistat.\nFat-soluble Vitamin Supplements and Analogues\nData from a pharmacokinetic interaction study showed that the absorption of beta-carotene supplement is reduced when concomitantly administered with orlistat. Orlistat inhibited absorption of a vitamin E acetate supplement. The effect of orlistat on the absorption of supplemental vitamin D, vitamin A, and nutritionally-derived vitamin K is not known at this time\nLevothyroxine\nHypothyroidism has been reported in patients treated concomitantly with orlistat and levothyroxine postmarketing . Patients treated concomitantly with orlistat and levothyroxine should be monitored for changes in thyroid function. Administer levothyroxine and orlistat at least 4 hours apart .\nWarfarin\nVitamin K absorption may be decreased with orlistat. Patients on chronic sdoses of warfarin who are prescribed orlistat should be monitored closely for changes in coagulation parameters.\nAntiepileptic Drugs\nConvulsions have been reported in patients treated concomitantly with orlistat and antiepileptic drugs. Patients should be monitored for possible changes in the frequency and/or severity of convulsions\n\n【30】 # Use in Specific Populations\n\n【31】 ### Pregnancy\nPregnancy Category (FDA): \nPregnancy Category X\nOrlistat is contraindicated during pregnancy, because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to the obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. No embryotoxicity or teratogenicity was seen in animals that received orlistat at doses much higher than the recommended human dose. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard of maternal weight loss to the fetus.\nAnimal Data\nReproduction studies were conducted in rats and rabbits at doses up to 800 mg/kg/day. Neither study showed embryotoxicity or teratogenicity. This dose is 23 and 47 times the daily human dose calculated on a body surface area (mg/m basis for rats and rabbits, respectively.\nPregnancy Category (AUS): \nThere is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Orlistat in women who are pregnant.\n\n【32】 ### Labor and Delivery\nThere is no FDA guidance on use of Orlistat during labor and delivery.\n\n【33】 ### Nursing Mothers\nIt is not known if orlistat is present in human milk. Caution should be exercised when orlistat is administered to a nursing woman.\n\n【34】 ### Pediatric Use\n- Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 have not been established.\n- The safety and efficacy of orlistat have been evaluated in obese adolescent patients aged 12 to 16 years. Use of orlistat in this age group is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of orlistat in adults with additional data from a 54-week efficacy and safety study and a 21-day mineral balance study in obese adolescent patients aged 12 to 16 years. Patients treated with orlistat in the 54-week efficacy and safety study (64.8% female, 75% Caucasians, 18.8% Blacks, and 6.3% Other) had a mean reduction in BMI of 0.55 kg/m2 compared with an average increase of 0.31 kg/m2 in placebo-treated patients (p=0.. In both adolescent studies, adverse effects were generally similar to those described in adults and included fatty/oily stool, oily spotting, and oily evacuation. In a subgroup of 152 orlistat and 77 placebo patients from the 54-week study, changes in body composition measured by DEXA were similar in both treatment groups with the exception of fat mass, which was significantly reduced in patients treated with orlistat compared to patients treated with placebo (-2.5 kg vs -0.6 kg, p=0.. Because orlistat can interfere with the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, all patients should take a daily multivitamin that contains vitamins A, D, E, K, and beta-carotene. The vitamin supplement should be taken at least 2 hours before or after orlistat .\n- Plasma concentrations of orlistat and its metabolites M1 and M3 were similar to those found in adults at the same dose level. Daily fecal fat excretions were 27% and 7% of dietary intake in orlistat and placebo treatment groups, respectively.\n\n【35】 ### Geriatic Use\nClinical studies of orlistat did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients.\n\n【36】 ### Gender\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Orlistat with respect to specific gender populations.\n\n【37】 ### Race\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Orlistat with respect to specific racial populations.\n\n【38】 ### Renal Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Orlistat in patients with renal impairment.\n\n【39】 ### Hepatic Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Orlistat in patients with hepatic impairment.\n\n【40】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Orlistat in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n\n【41】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\nThere is no FDA guidance one the use of Orlistat in patients who are immunocompromised.\n\n【42】 ### Others\n\n【43】 # Administration and Monitoring\n\n【44】 ### Administration\nOral\n\n【45】 ### Monitoring\nThere is limited information regarding Orlistat Monitoring in the drug label.\n\n【46】 # IV Compatibility\nThere is limited information regarding the compatibility of Orlistat and IV administrations.\n\n【47】 # Overdosage\nSingle doses of 800 mg orlistat and multiple doses of up to 600 mg three times a day for 15 days have been studied in normal weight and obese subjects without significant adverse findings.\nShould a significant overdose of orlistat occur, it is recommended that the patient be observed for 24 hours. Based on human and animal studies, systemic effects attributo the lipase-inhibiting properties of orlistat should be rapidly reversible.\n\n【48】 # Pharmacology\n\n【49】 ## Mechanism of Action\n- Orlistat is a reversible inhibitor of gastrointestinal lipases. It exerts its therapeutic activity in the lumen of the stomach and small intestine by forming a covalent bond with the active serine residue site of gastric and pancreatic lipases. The inactivated enzymes are thus unavailable to hydrolyze dietary fat in the form of triglycerides into absorbable free fatty acids and monoglycerides. As undigested triglycerides are not absorbed, the resulting caloric deficit may have a positive effect on weight control.\n\n【50】 ## Structure\n- Orlistat (orlistat) is a gastrointestinal lipase inhibitor for obesity management that acts by inhibiting the absorption of dietary fats.\n- Orlistat is (S)-2-formylamino-4-methyl-pentanoic acid (S)-1-(2S, 3S)-3-hexyl-4-oxo-2-oxetanyl methyl-dodecyl ester. Its empirical formula is C29H53NO5, and its molecular weight is 495.7. It is a single diastereomeric molecule that contains four chiral centers, with a negative optical rotation in ethanol at 529 nm. The structure is:\n- Orlistat is a white to off-white crystalline powder. Orlistat is practically insoluble in water, freely soluble in chloroform, and very soluble in methanol and ethanol. Orlistat has no pKa within the physiological pH range.\n- Orlistat is available for oral administration as a turquoise hard-gelatin capsule. The capsule is imprinted with black. Each capsule contains a pellet formulation consisting of 120 mg of the active ingredient, orlistat, as well as the inactive ingredients microcrystalline cellulose, sodium starch glycolate, sodium lauryl sulfate, povidone, and talc. The capsule shell contains gelatin, titanium dioxide, and FD&C Blue No. 2 with black printing ink containing pharmaceutical grade shellac, dehydrated alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, butyl alcohol, propylene glycol, strong ammonium solution, potassium hydroxide and black iron oxide.\n\n【51】 ## Pharmacodynamics\n'Dose-response Relationship'\nThe dose-response relationship for orlistat in human volunteers is shown in FIGURE 1. The effect is the percentage of ingested fat excreted, referred to as fecal fat excretion percentage. Both individual data (open circles) and the curve predicted for the population with the maximum-effect model (continuous line) are shown in FIGURE 1.\nAt the recommended therapeutic dose of 120 mg three times a day, orlistat inhibits dietary fat absorption by approximately 30%.\nEthanol does not affect orlistat's effect on preventing the absorption of fat.\n'Other Short-term Studies'\n- Adults\nIn several studies of up to 6-weeks duration, the effects of therapeutic doses of orlistat on gastrointestinal and systemic physiological processes were assessed in normal weight and obese subjects. Postprandial cholecystokinin plasma concentrations were lowered after multiple doses of orlistat in two studies but not significantly different from placebo in two other experiments. There were no clinically significant changes observed in gallbladder motility, bile composition or lithogenicity, or colonic cell proliferation rate, and no clinically significant reduction of gastric emptying time or gastric acidity. In addition, no effects on plasma triglyceride levels or systemic lipases were observed with the administration of orlistat in these studies. In a 3-week study of 28 healthy male volunteers, orlistat (120 mg three times a day) did not significantly affect the balance of calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, zinc, copper, and iron.\n- Pediatrics\nIn a 3-week study of 32 obese adolescents aged 12 to 16 years, orlistat (120 mg three times a day) did not significantly affect the balance of calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, zinc, or copper. The iron balance was decreased by 64.7 µmole/24 hours and 40.4 µmole/24 hours in orlistat and placebo treatment groups, respectively.\n\n【52】 ## Pharmacokinetics\nAbsorption\nSystemic exposure to orlistat is minimal. Following oral dosing with 360 mg 14C-orlistat, plasma radioactivity peaked at approximately 8 hours; plasma concentrations of intact orlistat were near the limits of detection (<5 ng/mL). In therapeutic studies involving monitoring of plasma samples, detection of intact orlistat in plasma was sporadic and concentrations were low (<10 ng/mL or 0.02 µM), without evidence of accumulation, and consistent with minimal absorption.\nDistribution\nIn vitro orlistat was >99% bound to plasma proteins (lipoproteins and albumin were major binding proteins). Orlistat minimally partitioned into erythrocytes.\nMetabolism\nBased on an oral 14C-orlistat mass balance study in obese patients, two metabolites, M1 ((the hydrolyzed β-lactone ring product of orlistat) and M3 (sequential metabolite after M1's cleavage of the N-formyl leucine side-chain), accounted for approximately 42% of total radioactivity in plasma. M1 and M3 have an open β-lactone ring and extremely weak lipase inhibitory activity (1000- and 2500-fold less than orlistat, respectively). In view of this low inhibitory activity and the low plasma levels at the therapeutic dose (average of 26 ng/mL and 108 ng/mL for M1 and M3, respectively, 2 to 4 hours after a dose), these metabolites are considered pharmacologically inconsequential. The primary metabolite M1 had a short half-life (approximately 3 hours) whereas the secondary metabolite M3 eliminated at a slower rate (half-life approximately 13.5 hours).\nElimination\n subject to biliary excretion. Approximately 97% of the administered radioactivity was excreted in feces; 83% of that was found to be unchanged orlistat. The cumulative renal excretion of total radioactivity was <2% of the given dose of 360 mg 14C-orlistat. The time to reach complete excretion (fecal plus urinary) was 3 to 5 days. The disposition of orlistat appeared to be similar between normal weight and obese subjects. Based on limited data, the half-life of the absorbed orlistat is in the range of 1 to 2 hours.\nSpecific Populations\nNo pharmacokinetic study was conducted for specific populations such as geriatric, different races, and patients with renal and hepatic impairment.\n\n【53】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\nCarcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\n- Carcinogenicity studies in rats and mice did not show a carcinogenic potential for orlistat at doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day and 1500 mg/kg/day, respectively. For mice and rats, these doses are 38 and 46 times the daily human dose calculated on an area under concentration vs time curve basis of total drug-related material.\n- Orlistat had no detecmutagenic or genotoxic activity as determined by the Ames test, a mammalian forward mutation assay (V79/HPRT), an in vitro clastogenesis assay in peripheral human lymphocytes, an unscheduled DNA synthesis assay (UDS) in rat hepatocytes in culture, and an in vivo mouse micronucleus test.\n- When given to rats at a dose of 400 mg/kg/day in a fertility and reproduction study, orlistat had no observable adverse effects. This dose is 12 times the daily human dose calculated on a body surface area (mg/m basis.\n\n【54】 # Clinical Studies\n- The long-term effects of XENICAL on morbidity and mortality associated with obesity have not been established.\n- The effects of orlistat on weight loss, weight maintenance, and weight regain and on a number of comorbidities (eg, type 2 diabetes, lipids, blood pressure) were assessed in the 4-year XENDOS study and in seven long-term (1- to 2-years duration) multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials. During the first year of therapy, the studies of 2-year duration assessed weight loss and weight maintenance. During the second year of therapy, some studies assessed continued weight loss and weight maintenance and others assessed the effect of orlistat on weight regain. These studies included over 2800 patients treated with orlistat and 1400 patients treated with placebo (age range 17-78 years, 80.2% women, 91.0% Caucasians, 5.7% Blacks, 2.3% Hispanics, 0.1% Other). The majority of these patients had obesity-related risk factors and comorbidities. In the XENDOS study, which included 3304 patients (age range 30-58 years, 55% women, 99% Caucasians, 1% other), the time to onset of type 2 diabetes was assessed in addition to weight management. In all these studies, treatment with orlistat and placebo designates treatment with orlistat plus diet and placebo plus diet, respectively.\n- During the weight loss and weight maintenance period, a well-balanced, reduced-calorie diet that was intended to result in an approximate 20% decrease in caloric intake and provide 30% of calories from fat was recommended to all patients. In addition, all patients were offered nutritional counseling.\n\n【55】 ## One-year Results: Weight Loss, Weight Maintenance, and Risk Factors\nPooled data from five clinical trials indicated that the overall mean weight loss from randomization to the end of 1 year of treatment in the intent-to-treat population was 13.4 lbs in the patients treated with orlistat and 5.8 lbs in the placebo-treated patients. After 1 year of treatment, the mean percent weight loss difference between orlistat-treated patients and placebo-treated patients was 3%. One thousand seventy two (69%) patients treated with orlistat and 701 (63%) patients treated with placebo completed 1 year of treatment. Of the patients who completed 1 year of treatment, 57% of the patients treated with orlistat (120 mg three times a day) and 31% of the placebo-treated patients lost at least 5% of their baseline body weight.\nThe percentages of patients achieving ≥5% and ≥10% weight loss after 1 year in five large multicenter studies for the intent-to-treat populations are presented in TABLE 6.\nThe relative changes in risk factors associated with obesity following 1 year of therapy with orlistat and placebo are presented for the population as a whole and for the population with abnormal values at randomization.\nPopulation as a Whole\nThe changes in metabolic, cardiovascular and anthropometric risk factors associated with obesity based on pooled data for five clinical studies, regardless of the patient's risk factor status at randomization, are presented in TABLE 7. One year of therapy with orlistat resulted in relative improvement in several risk factors.\nPopulation With Abnormal Risk Factors at Randomization\nThe changes from randomization following 1-year treatment in the population with abnormal lipid levels (LDL ≥130 mg/dL, LDL/HDL ≥3.5, HDL <35 mg/dL) were greater for orlistat compared to placebo with respect to LDL-cholesterol (-7.83% vs +1.14%) and the LDL/HDL ratio (-0.64 vs -0.. HDL increased in the placebo group by 20.1% and in the orlistat group by 18.8%. In the population with abnormal blood pressure at baseline (systolic BP ≥140 mm Hg), the change in SBP from randomization to 1 year was greater for orlistat (-10.89 mm Hg) than placebo (-5.07 mm Hg). For patients with a diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mm Hg, orlistat patients decreased by -7.9 mm Hg while the placebo patients decreased by -5.5 mm Hg. Fasting insulin decreased more for orlistat than placebo (-39 vs -16 pmol/L) from randomization to 1 year in the population with abnormal baseline values (≥120 pmol/L). A greater reduction in waist circumference for orlistat vs placebo (-7.29 vs -4.53 cm) was observed in the population with abnormal baseline values (≥100 cm).\n\n【56】 ## Effect on Weight Regain\n- Three studies were designed to evaluate the effects of orlistat compared to placebo in reducing weight regain after a previous weight loss achieved following either diet alone (one study,  or prior treatment with orlistat (two studies, 14119C and . The diet utilized during the 1-year weight regain portion of the studies was a weight-maintenance diet, rather than a weight-loss diet, and patients received less nutritional counseling than patients in weight-loss studies. For studies 14119C and 14185, patients' previous weight loss was due to 1 year of treatment with orlistat in conjunction with a mildly hypocaloric diet. Study 14302 was conducted to evaluate the effects of 1 year of treatment with orlistat on weight regain in patients who had lost 8% or more of their body weight in the previous 6 months on diet alone.\n- In study 14119C, patients treated with placebo regained 52% of the weight they had previously lost while the patients treated with orlistat regained 26% of the weight they had previously lost (p<0.. In study 14185, patients treated with placebo regained 63% of the weight they had previously lost while the patients treated with orlistat regained 35% of the weight they had lost (p<0.. In study 14302, patients treated with placebo regained 53% of the weight they had previously lost while the patients treated with orlistat regained 32% of the weight that they had lost (p<0.\n\n【57】 ## Two-year Results: Long-term Weight Control and Risk Factors\n- The treatment effects of orlistat were examined for 2 years in four of the five 1-year weight management clinical studies previously discussed  TABLE . At the end of year 1, the patients' diets were reviewed and changed where necessary. The diet prescribed in the second year was designed to maintain patient's current weight. Orlistat was shown to be more effective than placebo in long-term weight control in four large, multicenter, 2-year double-blind, placebo-controlled studies.\n- Pooled data from four clinical studies indicate that 74% of all patients treated with 120 mg three times a day of orlistat and 76% of patients treated with placebo completed 2 years of the same therapy. Pooled data from four clinical studies indicate that the mean weight loss difference between orlistat 120 mg three times a day and placebo treatment groups at year 2 in those patients who completed 1 year of treatment (ITT LOCF) was 3%. In the same studies cited in the One-year Results  TABLE , the percentages of patients achieving a ≥5% and ≥10% weight loss after 2 years are shown in TABLE 8.\n assessed in the population as a whole and the population with abnormal risk factors at randomization.\nPopulation as a Whole\nThe relative differences in risk factors between treatment with orlistat and placebo were similar to the results following 1 year of therapy for total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, LDL/HDL ratio, triglycerides, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, diastolic blood pressure, waist circumference, and hip circumference. The relative differences between treatment groups for HDL cholesterol and systolic blood pressure were less than that observed in the year one results.\nPopulation With Abnormal Risk Factors at Randomization\nThe relative differences in risk factors between treatment with orlistat and placebo were similar to the results following 1 year of therapy for LDL- and HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting insulin, diastolic blood pressure, and waist circumference. The relative differences between treatment groups for LDL/HDL ratio and isolated systolic blood pressure were less than that observed in the year one results.\n\n【58】 ## Four-year Results: Long-term Weight Control and Risk Factors\n- In the 4-year double-blind, placebo-controlled XENDOS study, the effects of orlistat in delaying the onset of type 2 diabetes and on body weight were compared to placebo in 3304 obese patients who had either normal or impaired glucose tolerance at baseline. Thirty-four percent of the 1655 patients who were randomized to the placebo group and 52% of the 1649 patients who were randomized to the orlistat group completed the 4-year study.\n- At the end of the study, the mean percent weight loss in the placebo group was -2.75% compared with -5.17% in the orlistat group (p<0.  FIGURE . Forty-five percent of the placebo patients and 73% of the orlistat patients lost ≥5% of their baseline body weight, and 21% of the placebo patients and 41% of the orlistat patients lost ≥10% of their baseline body weight following the first year of treatment. Following 4 years of treatment, 28% of the placebo patients and 45% of the orlistat patients lost ≥5% of their baseline body weight and 10% of the placebo patients and 21% of the orlistat patients lost ≥10% of their baseline body weight. After 4 years of treatment, the mean % difference in weight loss between orlistat treated patients and placebo was 2.5%.\n- ITT LOCF study population\n- The relative changes from baseline in risk factors associated with obesity following 4 years of therapy were assessed in the XENDOS study population  TABLE .\nOnset of Type 2 Diabetes in Obese Patients\n- In the XENDOS trial, in the overall population, orlistat delayed the onset of type 2 diabetes such that at the end of four years of treatment the cumulative incidence rate of diabetes was 8.3% for the placebo group compared to 5.5% for the orlistat group, p=0.01  TABLE . This finding was driven by a statistically-significant reduction in the incidence of developing type 2 diabetes in those patients who had impaired glucose tolerance at baseline (TABLE 10 and FIGURE . Orlistat did not reduce the risk for the development of diabetes in patients with normal glucose tolerance at baseline.\n- The effect of orlistat to delay the onset of type 2 diabetes in obese patients with IGT is presumably due to weight loss, and not to any independent effects of the drug on glucose or insulin metabolism. The effect of orlistat on weight loss is adjunctive to diet and exercise.\n\n【59】 ## Study of Patients With Type 2 Diabetes\n- A 1-year double-blind, placebo-controlled study in type 2 diabetics (N= stabilized on sulfonylureas was conducted. Thirty percent of patients treated with XENICAL achieved at least a 5% or greater reduction in body weight from randomization compared to 13% of the placebo-treated patients (p<0.. TABLE 11 describes the changes over 1 year of treatment with orlistat compared to placebo, in sulfonylurea usage and dose reduction as well as in hemoglobin HbA1c, fasting glucose, and insulin.\n- In addition, orlistat (n= compared to placebo (n= was associated with significant lowering for total cholesterol (-1.0% vs +9.0%, p≤0., LDL-cholesterol (-3.0% vs +10.0%, p≤0., LDL/HDL ratio (-0.26 vs -0.02, p≤0. and triglycerides (+2.54% vs +16.2%, p≤0., respectively. For HDL cholesterol, there was a +6.49% increase on orlistat and +8.6% increase on placebo, p>0.05. Systolic blood pressure increased by +0.61 mm Hg on orlistat and increased by +4.33 mm Hg on placebo, p>0.05. Diastolic blood pressure decreased by -0.47 mm Hg for orlistat and by -0.5 mm Hg for placebo, p>0.05\n\n【60】 ## Glucose Tolerance in Obese Patients\n- Two-year studies that included oral glucose tolerance tests were conducted in obese patients not previously diagnosed or treated for type 2 diabetes and whose baseline oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) status at randomization was either normal, impaired, or diabetic.\n- The progression from a normal OGTT at randomization to a diabetic or impaired OGTT following 2 years of treatment with orlistat (n= or placebo (n= were compared. Following treatment with orlistat, 0.0% and 7.2% of the patients progressed from normal to diabetic and normal to impaired, respectively, compared to 1.9% and 12.6% of the placebo treatment group, respectively.\n- In patients found to have an impaired OGTT at randomization, the percent of patients improving to normal or deteriorating to diabetic status following 1 and 2 years of treatment with orlistat compared to placebo are presented. After 1 year of treatment, 45.8% of the placebo patients and 73% of the orlistat patients had a normal oral glucose tolerance test while 10.4% of the placebo patients and 2.6% of the orlistat patients became diabetic. After 2 years of treatment, 50% of the placebo patients and 71.7% of the orlistat patients had a normal oral glucose tolerance test while 7.5% of placebo patients were found to be diabetic and 1.7% of orlistat patients were found to be diabetic after treatment.\n\n【61】 ## Pediatric Clinical Studies\n- The effects of orlistat on body mass index (BMI) and weight loss were assessed in a 54-week multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 539 obese adolescents (357 receiving orlistat 120 mg three times a day, 182 receiving placebo), aged 12 to 16 years. All study participants had a baseline BMI that was 2 units greater than the US weighted mean for the 95th percentile based on age and gender. Body mass index was the primary efficacy parameter because it takes into account changes in height and body weight, which occur in growing children.\n maintained on a well-balanced, reduced-calorie diet that was intended to provide 30% of calories from fat. In addition, all patients were placed on a behavior modification program and offered exercise counseling.\n- Approximately 65% of patients in each treatment group completed the study.\n- Following one year of treatment, BMI decreased by an average of 0.55 kg/m2 in the orlistat-treated patients and increased by an average of 0.31 kg/m2 in the placebo-treated patients (p=0..\n- The percentages of patients achieving ≥5% and ≥10% reduction in BMI and body weight after 52 weeks of treatment for the intent-to-treat population are presented in TABLE 12.\n\n【62】 # How Supplied\nXENICAL is a turquoise, hard-gelatin capsule containing pellets of powder.\nOrlistat 120 mg Capsules: Turquoise, two-piece, No. 1 opaque hard-gelatin capsule imprinted with ROCHE and XENICAL 120 in black ink — bottle of 90 (NDC 0004-0257-.\n\n【63】 ## Storage\nStore at 25°C (77°F); excursions permitted to 15° to 30°C (59° to 86°F) .

It is actively imported into the endoplasmic reticulum of cells and generates the oxidative potential found there. Protein disulfide isomerases are known to reduce DHA back to ascorbic acid, oxidizing their disulfide bonds in the process. Therefore L-dehydroascorbic acid is a vitamin C compound much like L-ascorbic acid. Oxidized forms of esterified ascorbic acids can be numbered at C or C atoms and the (free) chemical radical semi-dehydroascorbate or semidehydro ascorbic acid (SDA) to the group of dehydroascorbic acids.\n\n【2】 # Physiological Significance\n\n【3】 ## General significance\nAlthough there exists a transporter for Vitamin C, it is mainly present in specialized cells, whereas the glucose transporters, most notably GLUT1, ensure in most cells of the body the transport of vitamin C (in its oxidized form, DHA) where it is required as an enzyme cofactor and an intracellular antioxidant, after it is recycled back to ascorbic acid  Transport to mitochondria).\n\n【4】 ## Transport to mitochondria\nVitamin C accumulates in mitochondria, where most of the free radicals are produced, by entering through the glucose transporters, GLUT1. It is the oxidized form (dehydroascorbic acid) that is transported by GLUT1, not the reduced form (ascorbic acid). Ascorbic acid protects the mitochondrial genome and membrane.\n\n【5】 ## Transport to the brain\nVitamin C does not enter the brain. However, the brain is one of the organs which has the greatest concentrations of vitamin C.  It is dehydroascorbate that is transported through the blood-brain barrier via de GLUT1 transporters.  DHA is then converted to vitamin C. Administration of dehydroascorbic acid confers protection from neuronal injury following stroke (ischemic stroke).\nThe lack of increased intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) after the delayed administration of DHA after ischemia confers two significant advantages to this agent, which could lead to its utility at clinically relevant time points.  As a well-tolerated agent, it could be given safely in the field before arrival in the hospital and the definitive diagnosis of stroke. Furthermore, its low risk of increasing ICH when administered after stroke obviates the expenditure of valuable time within the therapeutic window by eliminating the prerequisite radiographic imaging studies.  Taken together, a pharmacological strategy to increase cerebral levels of ascorbate in stroke has tremendous potential to represent the timely translation of basic research into a relevant therapy for thromboembolic stroke in humans.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

The immediately inferred proposition is termed the converse of the original proposition. Conversion has distinctive applications in philosophical logic and mathematical logic. This article concerns its philosophical application distinct from the other traditional inference processes of contraposition and obversion where equivocation varys with different proposition types.\nThe process of conversion results in an equivalent proposition only in type \"E\" and type \"I\" propositions.  In the \"E\" type proposition both the subject term and the predicate term remain distributed in conversion, and in the \"I\" type proposition both the subject term and the predicate term remain undistributed in conversion.\nFor example, in the \"E\" type proposition No S is P conversion yields No P is S.  Both of the terms remain distributed, that is, their class membership is exhausted. It can be expressed grammatically in the statements:\nIn the \"I\" type proposition Some S is P conversion yields Some P is S.  Both of the terms remain undistributed, that is, their class membership is not exhausted. It can be expressed grammatically in the statements:\nIn an \"A\" type proposition, conversion of \"All S is P\" to \"All P is S\" may violate the rules of distribution, for example:\nAll popes are saints and All saints are popes.  In an \"A\" type proposition the subject term is distributed (exhausted) and the predicate undistributed.  Conversion distributes the predicate of the original proposition as the subject in the inferred proposition.  Contrast this with two other converted propositions:\nConversion  violates the rules of distribution and is invalid, whereas conversion  does not, and is valid.  Thus, logicians allow for conversion of the \"A\" type proposition with limitations, or per accidens.  For example, from All isosceles triangles have their base angles equal one can infer the \"I\" type proposition Some triangles with their base angles equal are isosceles.  The notion of limitation, or conversion per accidens, requires a change in the quantity of the proposition from universal to particular in instances where the rules of distribution may be violated.\nConversion of the \"O\" type proposition Some S is not P is not possible, in every instance violating the rules of distribution.\nThe schema of conversion is:\n\n【1】 # Bibliography\n- Aristotle.

{"seq_id": "a66690a7-7006-405b-baa9-baaa5ad8b96f", "title": null, "text": "【0】 Pneumonia in adults: diagnosis and management\n\n【1】 This guideline was developed before the COVID-19 pandemic. It covers diagnosing and managing pneumonia in adults who do not have COVID-19. It aims to improve accurate assessment and diagnosis of pneumonia to help guide antibiotic prescribing and ensure that people receive the right treatment.\n\n【2】 # Introduction\nPneumonia is an infection of the lung tissue. When a person has pneumonia the air sacs in their lungs become filled with microorganisms, fluid and inflammatory cells and their lungs are not able to work properly. Diagnosis of pneumonia is based on symptoms and signs of an acute lower respiratory tract infection, and can be confirmed by a chest X‑ray showing new shadowing that is not due to any other cause (such as pulmonary oedema or infarction). In this guideline pneumonia is classified as community‑acquired or hospital‑acquired, based on different microbial causes and patient factors, which need different management strategies.\nEvery year between 0.5% and 1% of adults in the UK will have community‑acquired pneumonia. It is diagnosed in 5–12% of adults who present to GPs with symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection, and 22–42% of these are admitted to hospital, where the mortality rate is between 5% and 14%. Between 1.2% and 10% of adults admitted to hospital with community‑acquired pneumonia are managed in an intensive care unit, and for these patients the risk of dying is more than 30%. More than half of pneumonia‑related deaths occur in people older than 84 years.\nAt any time 1.5% of hospital inpatients in England have a hospital‑acquired respiratory infection, more than half of which are hospital‑acquired pneumonia and are not associated with intubation. Hospital‑acquired pneumonia is estimated to increase hospital stay by about 8 days and has a reported mortality rate that ranges from 30–70%. Variations in clinical management and outcome occur across the UK.\nThe guideline is needed because pneumonia is common and has a high mortality rate. The  British Thoracic Society  has published guidance on the management of community-acquired pneumonia in adults, but there is a lack of evidence‑based guidance on the management of hospital‑acquired pneumonia. For both types of pneumonia there is variation in care and areas of uncertainty for best practice, and these are the main focus of this guideline.\nThis guideline provides recommendations for the diagnosis of pneumonia, and aspects of management of community‑acquired pneumonia in adults. However, it does not provide recommendations on areas of care where best practice is already established, such as diagnosis using chest X‑ray. It does not cover bronchiectasis complicated by pneumonia, or patients who acquire pneumonia while intubated or in an intensive care unit, who are immunocompromised, or in whom management of pneumonia is an expected part of end‑of‑life care. For guidance on antibiotic treatment of pneumonia, see NICE's guidelines on pneumonia (community-acquired): antimicrobial prescribing and pneumonia (hospital-acquired): antimicrobial prescribing.# Recommendations\nThe following guidance is based on the best available evidence. The full guideline gives details of the methods and the evidence used to develop the guidance.\nPeople have the right to be involved in discussions and make informed decisions about their care, as described in NICE's information on making decisions about your care.\nMaking decisions using NICE guidelines explains how we use words to show the strength (or certainty) of our recommendations, and has information about prescribing medicines (including off-label use), professional guidelines, standards and laws (including on consent and mental capacity), and safeguarding.\n\n【3】 # Terms used in this guideline\n\n【4】 ## Clinical diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia\nDiagnosis based on symptoms and signs of lower respiratory tract infection in a patient who, in the opinion of the GP and in the absence of a chest X‑ray, is likely to have community‑acquired pneumonia. This might be because of the presence of focal chest signs, illness severity or other features.\n\n【5】 ## Community-acquired pneumonia\nPneumonia that is acquired outside hospital. Pneumonia that develops in a nursing home resident is included in this definition. When managed in hospital the diagnosis is usually confirmed by chest X‑ray.\n\n【6】 ## Hospital-acquired pneumonia\nPneumonia that develops 48 hours or more after hospital admission and that was not incubating at hospital admission. When managed in hospital the diagnosis is usually confirmed by chest X‑ray. For the purpose of this guideline, pneumonia that develops in hospital after intubation (ventilator‑associated pneumonia) is excluded from this definition.\n\n【7】 ## Lower respiratory tract infection\nAn acute illness (present for 21 days or less), usually with cough as the main symptom, and with at least 1 other lower respiratory tract symptom (such as fever, sputum production, breathlessness, wheeze or chest discomfort or pain) and no alternative explanation (such as sinusitis or asthma). Pneumonia, acute bronchitis and exacerbation of chronic obstructive airways disease are included in this definition.\n\n【8】 ## Mortality risk\nThe percentage likelihood of death occurring in a patient in the next 30 days.\n\n【9】 ## Severity assessment\nA judgement by the managing clinician as to the likelihood of adverse outcomes in a patient. This is based on a combination of clinical understanding and knowledge in addition to a mortality risk score. The difference between categories of severity and mortality risk can be important. Typically the mortality risk score will match the severity assessment. However, there may be situations where the mortality score does not accurately predict mortality risk and clinical judgement is needed. An example might be a patient with a low mortality risk score who has an unusually low oxygen level, who would be considered to have a severe illness.\n\n【10】 # Presentation with lower respiratory tract infection\nFor people presenting with symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection in primary care, consider a point of care C‑reactive protein test if after clinical assessment a diagnosis of pneumonia has not been made and it is not clear whether antibiotics should be prescribed. Use the results of the C‑reactive protein test to guide antibiotic prescribing in people without a clinical diagnosis of pneumonia as follows:\nDo not routinely offer antibiotic therapy if the C‑reactive protein concentration is less than 20 mg/litre.\nConsider a delayed antibiotic prescription (a prescription for use at a later date if symptoms worsen) if the C‑reactive protein concentration is between 20 mg/litre and 100 mg/litre.\nOffer antibiotic therapy if the C‑reactive protein concentration is greater than 100 mg/litre.\n\n【11】 # Community-acquired pneumonia\n\n【12】 ## Severity assessment in primary care\nWhen a clinical diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia is made in primary care, determine whether patients are at low, intermediate or high risk of death using the CRB65 score  box .\nBox 1 CRB65 score for mortality risk assessment in primary care\nCRB65 score is calculated by giving 1 point for each of the following prognostic features:\nconfusion (abbreviated Mental Test score 8 or less, or new disorientation in person, place or time).

Thorax 58: 377–82\nUse clinical judgement in conjunction with the CURB65 score to guide the management of community‑acquired pneumonia, as follows:\nconsider home‑based care for patients with a CURB65 score of 0 or 1\nconsider hospital‑based care for patients with a CURB65 score of 2 or more\nconsider intensive care assessment for patients with a CURB65 score of 3 or more.\nStratify patients presenting with community‑acquired pneumonia into those with low‑, moderate‑ or high‑severity disease.

However, no randomised controlled trial has looked at using urinary antigen testing to target treatment. If effective, such targeted treatment could improve antibiotic stewardship, increase compliance and potentially reduce costs.\n\n【25】 # C-reactive protein-guided antibiotic duration\nIn patients hospitalised with moderate‑ to high‑severity community‑acquired pneumonia, does using C‑reactive protein monitoring in addition to clinical observation to guide antibiotic duration safely reduce the total duration of antibiotic therapy compared with a fixed empirical antibiotic course?\n\n【26】 ## Why this is important\nThe recommended duration of antibiotic therapy for adults hospitalised with moderate‑ to high‑severity community‑acquired pneumonia is based on evidence of very low quality; no relevant clinical trials were identified by NICE. The burden of community‑acquired pneumonia is large, and its treatment accounts for a high proportion of antibiotic use in hospitals. Overuse of antibiotics is associated with antimicrobial resistance, which is a national and global priority.\n\n【27】 # Continuous positive pressure ventilation\nWhat is the clinical effectiveness of continuous positive pressure ventilation compared with usual care in patients with community‑acquired pneumonia and type I respiratory failure without a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease?\n\n【28】 ## Why this is important\nType I respiratory failure is a common feature of pneumonia. Mild type I respiratory failure is easily corrected with low levels of supplemental oxygen, whereas severe life‑threatening hypoxemia needs immediate intubation and invasive ventilation. Research into whether continuous positive pressure ventilation improves gas exchange and subsequent outcomes, such as mortality, could help improve care for patients with respiratory failure between these extremes.\n\n【29】 # Hospital-acquired pneumonia\nCan rapid microbiological diagnosis of hospital‑acquired pneumonia reduce the use of extended-spectrum antibiotic therapy, without adversely affecting outcomes?\n\n【30】 ## Why this is important\nData are limited on the microbiology of hospital‑acquired pneumonia to guide antibiotic therapy. Hospital‑acquired infections can be caused by highly resistant pathogens that need treatment with extended‑spectrum antibiotics (for example, extended‑spectrum penicillins, third‑generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, carbapenems, linezolid, vancomycin, or teicoplanin), as recommended by British Society of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy guidance. Because routine microbial tests lack sensitivity and take 24–48 hours to identify a causative pathogen, patient characteristics are used to guide antibiotic choice. However, this may lead to unnecessary use of extended‑spectrum antibiotics in patients infected with non‑resistant organisms, and inappropriate use of first‑line antibiotics (such as beta‑lactam spenicillins, macrolides or doxycycline) in patients infected with resistant organisms.\nRapid diagnostic tests to identify causative bacterial pathogens and determine whether they are resistant to antibiotics may have a role in guiding antibiotic choice for postoperative hospital‑acquired pneumonia.\nTo limit population variability and include high‑risk patients spending time in intensive care, studies should include postoperative patients from different surgical specialties.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

The structure of a tRNA molecule is a distinctive folded structure which contains three hairpin loops and resembles a three-leafed clover.\n\n【2】 # Function\nMT-TH is a small 69 nucleotide transfer RNA (human mitochondrial map position 12138- that transfers the amino acid histidine to a growing polypeptide at the ribosomal site of protein synthesis during translation.\n\n【3】 # Clinical significance\nMutations in MT-TH can result in multiple mitochondrial deficiencies and associated disorders. MT-TH is associated with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS), cardiomyopathy, and the MELAS/MERRF overlap syndrome.\n\n【4】 ## Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS)\nA small number of people with symptoms of mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) have been found to have mutations in the MT-TH gene. MELAS is a rare mitochondrial disorder known to affect many parts of the body, especially the nervous system and the brain. Symptoms of MELAS include recurrent severe headaches, muscle weakness (myopathy), hearing loss, stroke-like episodes with a loss of consciousness, seizures, and other problems affecting the nervous system.\n\n【5】 ## MERRF/MELAS overlap syndrome\n known as MERRF syndrome. In addition to symptoms of MELAS syndrome, additional signs and symptoms may include muscle twitches (myoclonus), difficulty coordinating movement (ataxia), and abnormal muscle cells known as ragged-red fibers. The combination of MERRF and MELAS is called the MERRF/MELAS overlap syndrome, which is caused by mutations in the MT-TH gene. It has not been determined how such mutations alter the energy production function of the mitochondria and result in symptoms of such syndromes. A specific mutation of 12147G>A in the MT-TH gene has been found to result in the MERRF/MELAS overlap syndrome. A patient with the mutation exhibited symptoms of migrainous headache and vomiting, left hemiparesis, lateral homonymous hemianopia, and others consistent with the MERRF/MELAS overlap syndrome. The patient exhibited symptoms of MELAS first, then progressed into the overlap syndrome.\n\n【6】 ## Cardiomyopathy\n cause cardiomyopathy, a disorder of the heart characterized by the thickening of the heart, usually in the interventricular septum, which results in a weakened heart muscle that is unable to pump blood effectively. Patients with mutations in the MT-TH gene have been found to exhibit symptoms of cardiomyopathy without other common signs of mitochondrial disease such as neurological abnormalities. It is unclear why such mutations result in the symptoms of isolated cardiomyopathy. A specific mutation of 12192G>A in the MT-TH gene has been found in multiple patients with the disorder. patients exhibited symptoms of cardiomyopathy in different forms.\n\n【7】 ## Deafness, Nonsyndromic Sensorineural, Mitochondrial\n been associated with mutations in the MT-TH gene.

MULTAQ is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus.\n- Nursing mothers\n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients\n- MULTAQ is contraindicated in patients with NYHA Class IV heart failure or symptomatic heart failure with recent decompensation requiring hospitalization because it doubles the risk of death.\n- Cardiovascular Death and heart failure in Permanent AF\n- MULTAQ doubles the risk of cardiovascular death (largely arrhythmic) and heart failure events in patients with permanent AF. Patients treated with dronedarone should undergo monitoring of cardiac rhythm no less often than every 3 months. Cardiovert patients who are in atrial fibrillation (if clinically indicated) or discontinue MULTAQ. MULTAQ offers no benefit in subjects in permanent AF.\n- Increased Risk of Stroke in Permanent AF\n- In a placebo-controlled study in patients with permanent atrial fibrillation, dronedarone was associated with an increased risk of stroke, particularly in the first two weeks of therapy. MULTAQ should only be initiated in patients in sinus rhythm who are receiving appropriate antithrombotic therapy.\n- New Onset or Worsening heart failure\n- New onset or worsening of heart failure has been reported during treatment with MULTAQ in the postmarketing setting. In a placebo controlled study in patients with permanent AF increased rates of heart failure were observed in patients with normal left ventricular function and no history of symptomatic heart failure, as well as those with a history of heart failure or left ventricular dysfunction.\n- Advise patients to consult a physician if they develop signs or symptoms of heart failure, such as weight gain, dependent edema, or increasing shortness of breath. If heart failure develops or worsens and requires hospitalization, discontinue MULTAQ.\n- Liver Injury\n- Hepatocellular liver injury, including acute liver failure requiring transplant, has been reported in patients treated with MULTAQ in the postmarketing setting. Advise patients treated with MULTAQ to report immediately symptoms suggesting hepatic injury (such as anorexia, nausea, vomiting, fever, malaise, fatigue, right upper quadrant pain, jaundice, dark urine, or itching). Consider obtaining periodic hepatic serum enzymes, especially during the first 6 months of treatment, but it is not known whether routine periodic monitoring of serum enzymes will prevent the development of severe liver injury. If hepatic injury is suspected, promptly discontinue MULTAQ and test serum enzymes, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase, as well as serum bilirubin, to establish whether there is liver injury. If liver injury is found, institute appropriate treatment and investigate the probable cause. Do not restart MULTAQ in patients without another explanation for the observed liver injury.\n- Pulmonary Toxicity\n- Cases of interstitial lung disease including pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis have been reported in patients treated with MULTAQ in the post-marketing setting. Onset of dyspnea or non-productive cough may be related to pulmonary toxicity and patients should be carefully evaluated clinically. If pulmonary toxicity is confirmed, MULTAQ should be discontinued.\n- Hypokalemia and Hypomagnesemia with Potassium-Depleting Diuretics\n- Hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia may occur with concomitant administration of potassium-depleting diuretics. Potassium levels should be within the normal range prior to administration of MULTAQ and maintained in the normal range during administration of MULTAQ.\n- QT Interval Prolongation\n- Dronedarone induces a moderate (average of about 10 ms but much greater effects have been observed) QTc (Bazett) prolongation and . If the QTc Bazett interval is ≥500 ms, discontinue MULTAQ.\n- Renal Impairment and Failure\n- Marked increase in serum creatinine, pre-renal azotemia and acute renal failure, often in the setting of heart failure or hypovolemia, have been reported in patients taking MULTAQ. In most cases, these effects appear to be reversible upon drug discontinuation and with appropriate medical treatment. Monitor renal function periodically.\n- Small increases in creatinine levels (about 0.1 mg/dL) following dronedarone treatment initiation have been shown to be a result of inhibition of creatinine's tubular secretion.\n- The elevation has a rapid onset, reaches a plateau after 7 days and is reversible after discontinuation.\n- Women of Childbearing Potential\n- Premenopausal women who have not undergone a hysterectomy or oophorectomy must use effective contraception while using MULTAQ. Dronedarone caused fetal harm in animal studies at doses equivalent to recommended human doses. Counsel women of childbearing potential regarding appropriate contraceptive choices.\n- In clinical trials, premature discontinuation because of adverse reactions occurred in 11.8% of the dronedarone-treated patients and in 7.7% of the placebo-treated group. The most common reasons for discontinuation of therapy with MULTAQ were gastrointestinal disorders (3.2 % versus 1.8% in the placebo group) and QT prolongation (1.5% versus 0.5% in the placebo group).\n- The most frequent adverse reactions observed with MULTAQ 400 mg twice daily in the 5 studies were diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, and asthenia.\n-  displays adverse reactions more common with dronedarone 400 mg twice daily than with placebo in AF or AFL patients, presented by system organ class and by decreasing order of frequency. Adverse laboratory and ECG effects are presented separately in \n been reported at an incidence less than 1% in patients treated with MULTAQ.\n- The following laboratory data/ECG parameters were reported with MULTAQ 400 mg twice daily.\n- Assessment of demographic factors such as gender or age on the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events did not suggest an excess of adverse events in any particular sub-group.\nCardiac: New or worsening heart failure,atrial flutter with 1:1 atrioventricular conduction has been reported very rarely.\nHepatic: Liver Injury\nRespiratory: Interstitial lung disease including pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis\nImmune: Anaphylactic reactions including angioedema\nVascular: Vasculitis, including leukocytoclastic vasculitis\n- Drugs prolonging the QT interval (inducing Torsade de Pointes)\n- Co-administration of drugs prolonging the QT interval (such as certain phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants, certain macrolide antibiotics, and Class I and III antiarrhythmics) is contraindicated because of the potential risk of Torsade de Pointes-type ventricular tachycardia.\n- Digoxin\n- In the ANDROMEDA (patients with recently decompensated heart failure) and PALLAS (patients with permanent AF) trials baseline use of digoxin was associated with an increased risk of arrhythmic or sudden death in dronedarone-treated patients compared to placebo. In patients not taking digoxin, no difference in risk of sudden death was observed in the dronedarone vs. placebo groups.\n- Digoxin can potentiate the electrophysiologic effects of dronedarone (such as decreased AV-node conduction). Dronedarone increases exposure to digoxin.\n- Consider discontinuing digoxin. If digoxin treatment is continued, halve the dose of digoxin, monitor serum levels closely, and observe for toxicity.\n- Calcium channel blockers\n- Calcium channel blockers with depressant effects on the sinus and AV nodes could potentiate dronedarone's effects on conduction.\n- Give a low dose of calcium channel blockers initially and increase only after ECG verification of good tolerability.\n- Beta-blockers\n- In clinical trials, bradycardia was more frequently observed when dronedarone was given in combination with beta-blockers.\n- Give a low dose of beta-blockers initially, and increase only after ECG verification of good tolerability.\n- Ketoconazole and other potent CYP 3A inhibitors\n- Concomitant use of ketoconazole as well as other potent CYP 3A inhibitors such as itraconazole, voriconazole, ritonavir, clarithromycin, and nefazodone is contraindicated because exposure to dronedarone is significantly increased .\n- Grapefruit juice\n- Patients should avoid grapefruit juice beverages while taking MULTAQ because exposure to dronedarone is significantly increased.\n- Rifampin and other CYP 3A inducers\n- Avoid rifampin or other CYP 3A inducers such as phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and St John's wort because they decrease exposure to dronedarone significantly.\n- Calcium channel blockers\n- Verapamil and diltiazem are moderate CYP 3A inhibitors and increase dronedarone exposure. Give a low dose of calcium channel blockers initially and increase only after ECG verification of good tolerability.\n- Simvastatin\n- Dronedarone increased simvastatin/simvastatin acid exposure. Avoid doses greater than 10 mg once daily of simvastatin.\n- Other statins\n- Because of multiple mechanisms of interaction with statins (CYPs and transporters), follow statin label recommendations for use with CYP 3A and P-gp inhibitors such as dronedarone.\n- Calcium channel blockers\n- Dronedarone increased the exposure of calcium channel blockers (verapamil, diltiazem or nifedipine). Give a low dose of calcium channel blockers initially and increase only after ECG verification of good tolerability.\n- Sirolimus, tacrolimus, and other CYP3A substrates with narrow therapeutic range\n- Dronedarone can increase plasma concentrations of tacrolimus, sirolimus, and other CYP 3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic range when given orally. Monitor plasma concentrations and adjust dosage appropriately.\n- Beta-blockers and other CYP 2D6 substrates\n- Dronedarone increased the exposure of propranolol and metoprolol. Give low doses of beta-blockers initially, and increase only after ECG verification of good tolerability. Other CYP 2D6 substrates, including other beta-blockers, tricyclic antidepressants, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may have increased exposure upon co-administration with dronedarone.\n- P-glycoprotein substrates\n- Digoxin\n- Dronedarone increased digoxin exposure by inhibiting the P-gp transporter. Consider discontinuing digoxin. If digoxin treatment is continued, halve the dose of digoxin, monitor serum levels closely, and observe for toxicity.\n- Dabigatran\n- Exposure to dabigatran is higher when it is administered with dronedarone than when it is administered alone.\n- Other P-gp substrates are expected to have increased exposure when co-administered with dronedarone.\n- Warfarin\n- When co-administered with dronedarone exposure to S-warfarin was slightly higher than when warfarin was administered alone. There were no clinically significant increases in INR.\n- More patients experienced clinically significant INR elevations (≥  usually within 1 week after starting dronedarone vs. placebo in patients taking oral anticoagulants in ATHENA. However, no excess risk of bleeding was observed in the dronedarone group.\n- Postmarketing cases of increased INR with or without bleeding events have been reported in warfarin-treated patients initiated on dronedarone. Monitor INR after initiating dronedarone in patients taking warfarin.\n- When pregnant rats received dronedarone at oral doses greater than or equal to the MRHD (on a mg/m2 basis), fetuses had increased rates of external, visceral and skeletal malformations (cranioschisis, cleft palate, incomplete evagination of pineal body, brachygnathia, partially fused carotid arteries, truncus arteriosus, abnormal lobation of the liver, partially duplicated inferior vena cava, brachydactyly, ectrodactylia, syndactylia, and anterior and/or posterior club feet). When pregnant rabbits received dronedarone, at a dose approximately half the MRHD (on a mg/m2 basis), fetuses had an increased rate of skeletal abnormalities (anomalous ribcage and vertebrae, pelvic asymmetry) at doses ≥20 mg/kg (the lowest dose tested and approximately half the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis).\nActual animal doses: rat (≥80 mg/kg/day); rabbit (≥20 mg/kg)\n- Treatment with Class I or III antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, - flecainide, propafenone, quinidine, disopyramide, dofetilide, sotalol) or drugs that are strong inhibitors of CYP3A (e.g., ketoconazole) must be stopped before starting MULTAQ.\n- Consider obtaining periodic hepatic serum enzymes, especially during the first 6 months of treatment, but it is not known whether routine periodic monitoring of serum enzymes will prevent the development of severe liver injury\n- In most cases, these effects appear to be reversible upon drug discontinuation and with appropriate medical treatment. Monitor renal function periodically.\n- If digoxin treatment is continued, halve the dose of digoxin, monitor serum levels closely, and observe for toxicity.\n- Monitor plasma concentrations and adjust dosage appropriately.\n- Monitor INR after initiating dronedarone in patients taking warfarin.\n- In the event of overdosage, monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and blood pressure.\nIt is not known whether dronedarone or its metabolites can be removed by dialysis (hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis or hemofiltration).\n- There is no specific antidote available.\n- N-{2-butyl-3-benzofuran-5-yl} methanesulfonamide, hydrochloride.\n- Dronedarone HCl is a white fine powder that is practically insoluble in water and freely soluble in methylene chloride and methanol.\n- Its empirical formula is C31H44N2O5 S, HCl with a relative molecular mass of 593.2. Its structural formula is:\n- MULTAQ is provided as ts for oral administration.\n- Each t of MULTAQ contains 400 mg of dronedarone (expressed as base).\nThe inactive ingredients are:\n- Core of the ts- hypromellose, starch, crospovidone, poloxamer 407, lactose monohydrate, colloidal silicon dioxide, magnesium stearate.\n- Coating / polishing of the ts- hypromellose, polyethylene glycol 6000, titanium dioxide, carnauba wax.\n- Dronedarone exhibits properties of all four Vaughn-Williams antiarrhythmic classes, although it is unclear which of these are important in producing dronedarone's clinical effects. The effect of dronedarone on 12-lead ECG parameters (heart rate, PR, and QTc) was investigated in healthy subjects following repeated oral doses up to 1600 mg once daily or 800 mg twice daily for 14 days and 1600 mg twice daily for 10 days. In the dronedarone 400 mg twice daily group, there was no apparent effect on heart rate; a moderate heart rate lowering effect (about 4 bpm) was noted at 800 mg twice daily. There was a clear dose-dependent effect on PR-interval with an increase of +5 ms at 400 mg twice daily and up to +50 ms at 1600 mg twice daily. There was a moderate dose related effect on the QTc-interval with an increase of +10 ms at 400 mg twice daily and up to +25 ms with 1600 mg twice daily.\n- DAFNE was a dose-response study in patients with recurrent AF, evaluating the effect of dronedarone in comparison with placebo in maintaining sinus rhythm. The doses of dronedarone in this study were 400, 600, and 800 mg twice a day. In this small study, doses above 400 mg were not more effective and were less well tolerated.\n- Absorption\n- Because of presystemic first pass metabolism the absolute bioavailability of dronedarone without food is low, about 4%. It increases to approximately 15% when dronedarone is administered with a high fat meal. After oral administration in fed conditions, peak plasma concentrations of dronedarone and the main circulating active metabolite (N-debutyl metabolite) are reached within 3 to 6 hours. After repeated administration of 400 mg twice daily, steady state is reached within 4 to 8 days of treatment and the mean accumulation ratio for dronedarone ranges from 2.6 to 4.5. The steady state Cmax and exposure of the main N-debutyl metabolite is similar to that of the parent compound. The pharmacokinetics of dronedarone and its N-debutyl metabolite both deviate moderately from dose proportionality: a 2-fold increase in dose results in an approximate 2.5- to 3.0- fold increase with respect to Cmax and AUC.\n- Distribution\n- The in vitro plasma protein binding of dronedarone and its N-debutyl metabolite is >98 % and not saturable. Both compounds bind mainly to albumin. After intravenous (IV) administration the volume of distribution at steady state is about 1400 L.\n- Metabolism\n- Dronedarone is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP 3A. The initial metabolic pathway includes N-debutylation to form the active N-debutyl metabolite, oxidative deamination to form the inactive propanoic acid metabolite, and direct oxidation. The metabolites undergo further metabolism to yield over 30 uncharacterized metabolites. The N-debutyl metabolite exhibits pharmacodynamic activity but is 1/10 to 1/3 as potent as dronedarone.\n- Excretion/Elimination\n- In a mass balance study with orally administered dronedarone (14C-labeled) approximately 6% of the labeled dose was excreted in urine, mainly as metabolites (no unchanged compound excreted in urine), and 84% was excreted in feces, mainly as metabolites. Dronedarone and its N-debutyl active metabolite accounted for less than 15% of the resultant radioactivity in the plasma.\n- After IV administration the plasma clearance of dronedarone ranges from 130 to 150 L/h. The elimination half-life of dronedarone ranges from 13 to 19 hours.\n- Dronedarone did not demonstrate genotoxic potential in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test, the Ames bacterial mutation assay, the unscheduled DNA synthesis assay, or an in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes. S-9 processed dronedarone, however, was positive in a V79 transfected Chinese hamster V79 assay.\n- In fertility studies conducted with female rats, dronedarone given prior to breeding and implantation caused an increase in irregular estrus cycles and cessation of cycling at doses ≥10mg/kg (equivalent to 0.12× the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis).\nCorpora lutea, implantations and live fetuses were decreased at 100 mg/kg (equivalent to 1.2× the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis). There were no reported effects on mating behavior or fertility of male rats at doses of up to 100 mg/kg/day.\n- ATHENA was a multicenter, multinational, double blind, and randomized placebo-controlled study of dronedarone in 4628 patients with a recent history of AF/AFL who were in sinus rhythmor who were to be converted to sinus rhythm. The objective of the study was to determine whether dronedarone could delay death from any cause or hospitalization for cardiovascular reasons.\n- Initially patients were to be ≥70 years old, or <70 years old with at least one risk factor (including hypertension, diabetes, prior cerebrovascular accident, left atrial diameter ≥50 mm or LVEF<0.. The inclusion criteria were later changed such that patients were to be ≥75 years old, or ≥70 years old with at least one risk factor. Patients had to have both AF/AFL and sinus rhythm documented within the previous 6 months. Patients could have been in AF/AFL or in sinus rhythm at the time of randomization, but patients not in sinus rhythm were expected to be either electrically or chemically converted to normal sinus rhythm after anticoagulation.\n- Subjects were randomized and treated for up to 30 months (median follow-up: 22 months) with either MULTAQ 400 mg twice daily (2301 patients) or placebo (2327 patients), in addition to conventional therapy for cardiovascular diseases that included beta-blockers (71%), ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) (69%), digoxin (14%), calcium antagonists (14%), statins (39%), oral anticoagulants (60%), aspirin (44%), other chronic antiplatelet therapy (6%) and diuretics (54%).\n explored.\n- Patients ranged in age from 23 to 97 years; 42% were 75 years old or older. Forty-seven percent (47%) of patients were female and a majority was Caucasian (89%). Approximately seventy percent (71%) of those enrolled had no history of heart failure.

NSCLC accounts for 80 percent of all lung cancer cases, and is categorized using the TNM staging system, which was recently updated by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC). 3 The staging definitions and stage groups for NSCLC are summarized in a supporting document (NSCLC Staging System).\n\n【1】 # GUIDELINE QUESTIONS\n- What are the recommended treatment options for patients with operable stage III non-small cell lung cancer?\n- What are the recommended treatment options with curative intent for patients with inoperable stage III non-small cell lung cancer? 3. When is palliation recommended, and what are the recommended palliative treatment options for patients with inoperable stage III non-small cell lung cancer?\n\n【2】 # DEVELOPMENT AND REVISION HISTORY\nThis guideline was reviewed and endorsed by the Alberta Provincial Thoracic Tumour Team. Members of the Alberta Provincial Thoracic Tumour Team include medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, surgical oncologists, nurses, pathologists, and pharmacists. Evidence was selected and reviewed by a working group comprised of members from the Alberta Provincial Thoracic Tumour Team and a Knowledge Management Specialist from the Guideline Utilization Resource Unit. A detailed description of the methodology followed during the guideline development process can be found in the Guideline Utilization Resource Unit Handbook. This guideline was originally developed in July, 2008. It was revised in September, 2009 and April, 2012.\n\n【3】 # SEARCH STRATEGY\nFor this guideline update, the working group conducted a search for new or updated practice guidelines published since September 2009 by accessing the websites of the following organizations: Cancer Care Ontario, the British Columbia Cancer Agency, Cancer Care Nova Scotia, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, the American Society of Clinical Oncology, the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network, the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence, the American College of Chest Physicians, the European Society of Medical Oncology, Irish Journal of Oncology and Cancer Council Australia.\nMedical journal articles were searched using the Medline, Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews, and PubMed electronic databases. The search term \"non small cell lung cancer stage III\" was searched, including related terms. Limits placed on the search included: publication between 2008 and present, \"meta-analysis\", \"clinical trial\", \"randomized controlled trial\", \"clinical trial, phase III\", \"clinical trial, phase IV\", \"controlled clinical trial\", \"humans\", and \"English\". Results were further excluded if they were phase I or II clinical trials, included less than 100 patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer (in clinical trials), were not related to treatment, focused only on the treatment of metastases, did not include an analysis of outcomes achieved by patients with stage III disease and did not discuss survival. The reference lists of relevant Cochrane reviews and guidelines by ACCP and NCCN were scanned to further identify relevant phase III clinical trials.\nThe working group reviewed the acceptability and findings of all relevant literature and updated the guideline for the treatment of stage III non-small cell lung cancer. A draft of the guideline was then circulated to the entire provincial tumour team for final feedback and approval.\n\n【4】 # TARGET POPULATION\nThe recommendations in this guideline apply to adult patients over the age of 18 years.\n- Whenever possible, patients should be considered for eligibility in ongoing clinical trials.\nTreatment for Operable Disease (T3N1, selected T4N0- 2. Surgical resection is recommended. 3. Extended pulmonary resection may be performed in selected lesions. These include peripheral lesions invading the chest wall, apical lung carcinomas, central lesions with limited mediastinal invasion, or focal pericardial or phrenic nerve invasion. Carinal tumours and those within 2 cm of the carina occasionally may be amenable to resection with airway reconstruction. 4. Platinum-based chemotherapy regimens are recommended as post-operative adjuvant therapy in the management of patients with completely resected stage IIIA NSCLC.  Cisplatin-based treatment is preferred, although carboplatin-based regimens can be used as an alternative if there is a contraindication to cisplatin. 5. Adjuvant radiotherapy after surgical resection is not routinely recommended. However, this treatment could be considered when there is microscopic involvement of the resection margin, including the bronchial resection margin.\nCurative Intent Treatment for Inoperable Disease 6. Combined concurrent chemo-radiation is recommended for inoperable stage III patients with good performance status (ECOG 0-, minimal weight loss, good pulmonary reserve, and tumour and anatomy conformation permitting radical dose radiation without expected severe normal tissue toxicity.  Cisplatin-based chemotherapy (with either etoposide or vinorelbine) and thoracic radiation of 55Gy in 25 fractions to 66Gy in 33 fractions is the recommended treatment option.\n- For patients with borderline performance status or moderate weight loss (5-10%), concurrent or sequential chemo-radiation or higher dose hypofractionated radiation are options.\nTreatment for T1-3N2 Disease 8. Concurrent chemo-radiation is recommended for pre-operatively diagnosed N2 disease. Cisplatinbased chemotherapy (with either etoposide or vinorelbine) and thoracic radiation of 55 Gy in 25 fractions to 66 Gy in 33 fractions is the recommended treatment option. Additional cycles of chemotherapy can be considered for bulky disease. 9. In select patients, neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by lobectomy can be considered. Preoperative pathologically diagnosed N2 disease is not recommended to undergo surgical resection alone. 10. For patients with N2 disease discovered intra-operatively where complete resection of the lymph nodes and primary tumour is technically possible, completion of the planned lung resection is recommended. 11. In patients with N2 disease discovered intra-operatively, platinum-based adjuvant chemotherapy is recommended. Adjuvant radiotherapy can be considered in select patients.\n\n【5】 # Palliative Treatment for Inoperable Disease\n- In patients where lung reserve precludes radical radiotherapy, palliative chemotherapy and/or palliative radiotherapy are recommended. 13.

Individual boils can cluster together and form an interconnected network of boils called carbuncles. In severe cases, boils may develop to form abscesses.\n\n【2】 # Historical Perspective\nStaphylococcus aureus was discovered in late 1870's by Alexander Ogston, a surgeon at the Aberdeen Royal Infirmary. It was discovered to be the major cause of skin and soft tissue infections such as boils, staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome and impetigo . Carl Alois Philipp Garrè was a Swiss surgeon who proved that Staphylococcus aureus causes carbuncles and boils by self experimentation. Dr. Garre discovered and named Garre's sclerosing osteomyelitis (sclerosing osteitis – form of chronic osteomyelitis with proliferative periostitis).\n\n【3】 # Classification\nBoil (furuncle) may be classified according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD- based on anatomical location. Based on the duration of symptoms, boils may be classified into acute and chronic.\n\n【4】 # Pathophysiology\nBoil (furuncle) is a localized deep suppurative necrotizing form of folliculitis which involves the dermis and the subcutaneous tissue. Staphylococcus aureus is the most common causative agent. Following an abrasion or cut, the pathogen uses the wound site to invade and colonize the hair follicle. This leads to the formation of tender, erythematous, perifollicular nodule. The boil later becomes painful and fluctuant leading to discharge of pus and formation of necrotic plugs, which may leave a scar.\n\n【5】 # Causes\nBoils (furuncles) are generally caused by an infection of the hair follicles by Staphylococcus aureus or Staphylococcus epidermidis.\n\n【6】 # Differentiating Boil overview from Other Diseases\nBoil (furuncle) must be differentiated from other common diseases that cause tender swelling or a reddened lump filled with pus such as cystic acne, hydradrenitis suppurativa, and pilonidal cyst.\n\n【7】 # Epidemiology and Demographics\nThe incidence and prevalence of boils (furuncles) is uncertain. In England, between 2002-2003, boils and carbuncles were responsible for approximately 190 out of 100,000 hospital visits. Patients with all age groups can develop boils(furuncles). Boils(furuncles) is common among teenagers and young adults.\n\n【8】 # Risk Factors\nCommon risk factors in the development of boils include immunosupression, malnutrition, coexisting skin conditions, and poor hygiene.\n\n【9】 # Screening\nAccording to the U.S. Preventive Service Task Force (USPSTF), there is insufficient evidence to recommend routine screening for furunculosis.\n\n【10】 # Natural History, Complications, and Prognosis\nIf left untreated, patients with boils (furuncles) may progress to develop carbuncles, fever, and lymphadenopathy. The most common complications of boils include scarring and recurrence. Other complications include septicemia leading to abscess of spinal cord, brain, kidneys, or other organs. The prognosis is generally good, however, it varies with underlying risk factors.\n\n【11】 # Diagnosis\n\n【12】 ## History and Symptoms\nA detailed and thorough history from the patient is necessary. Specific areas of focus when obtaining a history from the patient include history of immunosupression, family history of furunculosis, history of contact sports, history of close contact, and recent travel. Common symptoms of the boil include firm, red, and painful bump with pus filled head.\n\n【13】 ## Physical Examination\nPatients with boils usually appear normal. However, the appearance varies with the associated risk factors.\n\n【14】 ### Images\nThe following are the images associated with boils on extremities.\n- url = >\n- url = >\n- url = >\n- url = >\n- url = >\n- url = >\n\n【15】 ## Laboratory Findings\nLaboratory study which is consistent with the diagnosis of boils include the pus culture.\n\n【16】 ## Imaging Findings\nX ray may be performed to detect internal abscess and osteomyelitis.\n\n【17】 ## Other Diagnostic Studies\nOther diagnostic studies of boils include blood analysis, urine analysis, and biopsy.\n\n【18】 # Treatment\n\n【19】 ## Medical Therapy\nThe mainstay of therapy for mild furuncles is incision and drainage only. Antimicrobial therapies are indicated in moderate and severe furuncles. Empiric antimicrobial therapies for furuncle include either TMP-SMX or Doxycycline for moderate furuncles, and either Vancomycin, Daptomycin, Linezolid, Telavancin, or Ceftaroline for severe furuncles.\n\n【20】 ## Surgery\nIncision and drainage is indicated if the boil is deep large and persistent despite medical therapy.\n\n【21】 ## Prevention\nPrimary prevention\nEffective measures for primary prevention of boils include hand washing, antibacterial soaps, maintain proper hygiene (hand sanitizers, antiseptic washes), avoid close contact (homeless shelters, military, prisons).\nSecondary prevention\nSecondary prevention strategies following boils are warm moist compresses on the boil, hand washing, and proper wound care.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Paranoid thinking typically includes persecutory beliefs concerning a perceived threat. In the original Greek, παράνοια (paranoia) simply means madness (para = outside; nous = mind) and, historically, this characterization was used to describe any delusional state.\n\n【2】 # Use in psychiatry\nMore recently, the clinical use of the term has been used to describe delusions where the affected person believes they are being persecuted. Specifically, they have been defined as containing two central elements:\n- The individual thinks that harm is occurring, or is going to occur, to him or her.\n- The individual thinks that the persecutor has the intention to cause harm.\n be a side effect of medication or recreational drugs such as marijuana and particularly stimulants such as methamphetamine.\nIn the unrestricted use of the term, common paranoid delusions can include the belief that the person is being followed, poisoned or loved at a distance (often by a media or important person, a delusion known as erotomania or de Clerambault syndrome).\nOther common paranoid delusions include the belief that the person has an imaginary disease or parasitic infection (delusional parasitosis); that the person is on a special quest or has been chosen by God; that the person has had thoughts inserted or removed from conscious thought; or that the person's actions are being controlled by an external force.\nTherefore, in common usage, the term paranoid addresses a range of\nmental conditions, assumed by the use of the term to be of psychiatric origin, in which the subject is seen to generalise or project fears and anxieties onto the external world, particularly in the form of organised behaviour focused on them. The syndrome is applied equally to powerful people like executives obsessed with takeover bids or political leaders convinced of plots against them, and to insignificant people who believe for instance that shadowy agencies are operating against them.\n\n【3】 # History\nThe term paranoia was used by Emil Kraepelin to describe a mental illness in which a delusional belief is the sole or most prominent feature. In his original attempt at classifying different forms of mental illness, Kraepelin used the term pure paranoia to describe a condition where a delusion was present, but without any apparent deterioration in intellectual abilities and without any of the other features of dementia praecox, the condition later renamed schizophrenia. Notably, in his definition, the belief does not have to be persecutory to be classified as paranoid, so any number of delusional beliefs can be classified as paranoia. For example, a person who has the sole delusional belief that he is an important religious would be classified by Kraepelin as having 'pure paranoia'.\n\n【4】 # Causes\n\n【5】 ## Common Causes\n- Schizophrenia\n- Paranoid personality disorder\n- Drug abuse\n- Poisoning\n\n【6】 ## Causes by Organ System\n\n【7】 ## Causes in Alphabetical Order\n- Bilateral mesencephalo-thalamic ischaemia\n- Acute intermittent porphyria\n- Alcohol Withdrawal\n- Alcoholism\n- Amphetamine Sulfate\n- Binswanger's disease\n- Brain tumor\n- Cannabis intoxication\n- Cannabis\n- Carbidopa\n- Cathinone poisoning\n- ChildhoodOnset Schizophrenia\n- Chromosome 22q11 Deletion Spectrum\n- Cocaine addiction\n- Crystal meth addiction\n- Delusional disorders\n- Dopar\n- Down's Syndrome associated Alzheimer's disease\n- Dronabinol\n- Ecstasy addiction\n- Ecstasy withdrawal\n- Ecstasy\n- Efavirenz\n- Frontotempoal atrophy\n- GHB withdrawal \n- Hawaiian Baby Woodrose poisoning\n- Heroin dependence\n- ICU psychosis\n- Levodopa\n- LSD addiction\n- Lupus\n- Marijuana abuse\n- Marijuana addiction\n- Marijuana intoxication\n- Marijuana overdose\n- Marijuana\n- Marinol\n- Mazindol\n- Methyldopa\n- Methyphenidate\n- Mulitiple sclerosis\n- Narcotic addiction\n- Opioid addiction\n- Oxycontin addiction\n- Panic attacks\n- Paranoid Personality Disorder\n- Parkinson disease\n- Pergolide\n- Prolintane\n- Psychosis\n- PTSD\n- Right parietal lobe syndrome\n- Ritalin\n- Schizoaffective disorder\n- Schizoid personality disorder\n- Schizophrenia\n- Shprintzen syndorme   \n- Social phobia\n- Sodium oxybate\n- Steroid abuse\n- Substance Withdrawal Syndrome\n- Thioridazine Hydrochloride\n- Tranquilizer addiction\n- Wolfram's disease\n- Wormwood  poisoning", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

{"seq_id": "8e9755f7-46ed-4ea7-a4e0-f0e017129866", "title": null, "text": "【0】 Phosphate reserves\nA well-fed adult in the industrialized world consumes and excretes about 1-3 g of phosphorus per day in the form of phosphate (2-6 x 1022 molecules). Per the elemental composition of the \"standard man\" of 70 kg, phosphorus is 780 g or 1.1% (as 1.52 x 1025 molecules of phosphate). Of this 1.4 g/kg (98 g, 1.9 x 1024 molecules of phosphate) are present in soft tissue with the remainder (1.33 x 1025 molecules of phosphate) in mineralized tissue such as bone and teeth. Only about 0.1% of body phosphate (about 2 x 1022 molecules) circulates in the blood, but this amount reflects the amount of phosphate available to soft tissue cells. Blood plasma contains orthophosphate (as HPO42-) and H2PO4- in the ratio of about 4:1.\nThe total quantity of ATP in the human body is about 0.1 mole (about 6 x 1022 molecules). This ATP is constantly being broken down into ADP, and then converted back into ATP. At any given time, the total amount of ATP + ADP remains fairly constant. The energy used by human cells requires the hydrolysis of 100 to 150 moles (6 to 9 x 1025 molecules) of ATP daily which is around 50 to 75 kg. Typically, a human will use up their body weight of ATP over the course of the day. This means that each ATP molecule is recycled 1000 to 1500 times daily, or about once every minute.\nThere are intracellular and extracellular PPi levels in many tissues.\n\n【1】 # Intracellular phosphate\nWith the number of cells in the human body of 10-100 trillion or 1013 to 1014, there are approximately 1.9-19.0 x 1010 atoms of phosphorus (1.9 to 19 x 1010 molecules of phosphate) per cell. Some of this, ~6 x 108 molecules can be ATP.\nA typical cell volume is 5 x 10-16 m3. If a typical cell was totally liquid water, there would be about 1.7 x 1013 molecules of water present. Then the phosphate concentration would be on the order of 10-3. However, a cell is about twice as dense as liquid water, then perhaps only 50% water yielding 5 x 10-3 for phosphate concentration. As computer simulation has shown the probability of finding a target by diffusion decreases rapidly with distance and becomes <1% when the starting distance exceeds the target's 10-fold radius, which by assumption of a simple spherical volume would put the target's concentration on the order of 10-3.\nAlthough ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 3 (ENPP regulates intracellular PPi concentrations it does not seem to significantly regulate extracellular PPi.\n\n【2】 # Extracellular phosphate\nPPi inhibits hydroxyapatite deposition in bone and cartilage. Many studies have shown that PPi is a potent inhibitor of calcification, bone mineralization, and bone resorption. Human defects in alkaline phosphatase, an enzyme that degrades PPi, lead to an increase in PPi levels and a severe block in skeletal mineralization. Genetic defects in a cell surface ectoenzyme that normally generates extracellular PPi from nucleotide triphosphate cause ectopic mineralization of joints and ligaments and may be associated with spinal ligament ossification in humans.\n\n【3】 # Teeth\nEnamel is the hardest and most highly mineralized substance of the body and is one of the four major tissues which make up the tooth, along with dentin, cementum, and dental pulp. Ninety-six percent of enamel consists of mineral, with water and organic material composing the rest. Enamel varies in thickness over the surface of the tooth and is often thickest at the cusp, up to 2.5 mm, and thinnest at its border, which is seen clinically as the cementoenamel junction (CEJ). Enamel's primary mineral is hydroxyapatite, which is a crystalline calcium phosphate.  Unlike dentin and bone, enamel does not contain collagen. Instead, it has two unique classes of proteins called amelogenins and enamelins.\nThe basic unit of enamel is called an enamel rod. Measuring 4 μm - 8 μm in diameter an enamel rod, formerly called an enamel prism, is a tightly packed mass of hydroxyapatite crystals in an organized pattern. In cross section, it is best compared to a keyhole, with the top, or head, oriented toward the crown of the tooth, and the bottom, or tail, oriented toward the root of the tooth.\nThe arrangement of the crystals within each enamel rod is highly complex. Both ameloblasts (the cells which initiate enamel formation) and Tomes' processes affect the crystals' pattern. Enamel crystals in the head of the enamel rod are oriented parallel to the long axis of the rod. When found in the tail of the enamel rod, the crystals' orientation diverges slightly from the long axis.\nDentin is the substance between enamel or cementum and the pulp chamber. Dentin, which is less mineralized and less brittle, compensates for enamel and is necessary as a support. The porous, yellow-hued material is made up of 70% by weight, mainly the mineral, hydroxylapatite and some non-crystalline amorphous calcium phosphate), 20% organic materials (90% of which is collagen type 1 and the remaining 10% ground substance, which includes dentine-specific proteins), and 10% water by weight. Dentin is a mineralized connective tissue with an organic matrix of collagenous proteins.\nCementum is a specialized bony substance covering the root of a tooth. It is approximately 45% inorganic material (mainly hydroxyapatite), 33% organic material (mainly collagen) and 22% water. The chemical makeup of cementum is similar to that of bone, but it lacks vascularization. Volumetrically, it is approximately 65% inorganic material (mainly hydroxyapatite), 23% organic material (mainly collagen type1]) and 12% water.\nPulp is the part in the center of a tooth made up of living soft tissue and cells called odontoblasts. Each person has a total of 52 pulp organs, 32 in the permanent and 20 in the primary teeth. The total volume of all the permanent teeth organs is 0.38cc and the mean volume of a single adult human pulp is 0.02cc.\n\n【4】 # Bone\nThe matrix is the major constituent of bone, surrounding the cells. It has inorganic and organic parts. Bone is not a uniformly solid material, but rather has some spaces between its hard elements.\n\n【5】 ## Compact bone\n be referred to as dense bone or cortical bone.\n\n【6】 ## Trabecular bone\n called cancellous or spongy bone) which is comprised of a network of rod- and plate-like elements that make the overall organ lighter and allowing room for blood vessels and marrow.  Trabecular bone accounts for the remaining 20% of total bone mass, but has nearly ten times the surface area of compact bone.\n\n【7】 ## Inorganic matrix\nThe inorganic matrix is mainly crystalline mineral salts and calcium, which is present in the form of hydroxyapatite. The matrix is initially laid down as unmineralized osteoid (manufactured by osteoblasts). Mineralisation involves osteoblasts secreting vesicles containing alkaline phosphatase. This cleaves the phosphate groups and acts as the foci for calcium and phosphate deposition. The vesicles then rupture and act as a centre for crystals to grow on.\n\n【8】 ## Organic matrix\nThe organic part of matrix is mainly Type I collagen. This is made intracellularly as tropocollagen and then exported. It then associates into fibrils. Also making up the organic part of matrix include various growth factors, the functions of which are not fully known. Other factors present include glycosaminoglycans, osteocalcin, osteonectin, bone sialo protein and Cell Attachment Factor. One of the main things that distinguishes the matrix of a bone from that of another cell is that the matrix in bone is hard.\n\n【9】 ## Woven or lamellar matrix\nBone is first deposited as woven bone, in a disorganized structure with a high proportion of osteocytes in young and in healing injuries. Woven bone is weaker, with a small number of randomly oriented collagen fibers, but forms quickly. It is replaced by lamellar bone, which is highly organized in concentric sheets with a low proportion of osteocytes. Lamellar bone is stronger and filled with many collagen fibers parallel to other fibers in the same layer.  The fibers run in opposite directions in alternating layers, much like plywood, assisting in the bone's ability to resist torsion forces.  After a break, woven bone quickly forms and is gradually replaced by slow-growing lamellar bone on pre-existing calcified hyaline cartilage through a process known as \"bony substitution.\"\n\n【10】 ## Bone resorption\nDuring bone resorption high levels of phosphate are released into the ECF as osteoclasts tunnel into mineralized bone, breaking it down and releasing phosphate, that results in a transfer of phosphate from bone fluid to the blood. During childhood, bone formation exceeds resorption, but as the aging process occurs, resorption exceeds formation.\n\n【11】 # Phosphate molecule locations\n\n【12】 # Acknowledgements\nThe content on this page was first contributed by: Henry A.

There is a Black Box Warning for this drug as shown here.  Common adverse reactions include Anorexia, epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, proteinuria and bone marrow supression.\n\n【4】 # Adult Indications and Dosage\n\n【5】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Adult)\n\n【6】 ### Indications\n deposited as characteristic, asymptomatic, golden-brown Kayser-Fleischer rings in the corneas of all patients with cerebral symptomatology and some patients who are either asymptomatic or manifest only hepatic symptomatology.\n- Two types of patients require treatment for Wilson's disease:  the symptomatic, and  the asymptomatic in whom it can be assumed the disease will develop in the future if the patient is not treated.\n- The diagnosis, if suspected on the basis of family or individual history or physical examination, can be confirmed if the plasma copper-protein ceruloplasmin2 is 250 mcg/g dry weight) or Kayser-Fleischer rings are present.\n- Treatment has two objectives:\n- to minimize dietary intake of copper;\n- to promote excretion and complex formation (i.e., detoxification) of excess tissue copper.\n- The first objective is attained by a daily diet that contains no more than one or two milligrams of copper. Such a diet should exclude, most importantly, chocolate, nuts, shellfish, mushrooms, liver, molasses, broccoli, and cereals and dietary supplements enriched with copper, and be composed to as great an extent as possible of foods with a low copper content. Distilled or demineralized water should be used if the patient's drinking water contains more than 0.1 mg of copper per liter.\n- For the second objective, a copper chelating agent is used.\n- In symptomatic patients this treatment usually produces marked neurologic improvement, fading of Kayser-Fleischer rings, and gradual amelioration of hepatic dysfunction and psychic disturbances.\n- Clinical experience to date suggests that life is prolonged with the above regimen.\n- Noticeable improvement may not occur for one to three months. Occasionally, neurologic symptoms become worse during initiation of therapy with CUPRIMINE. Despite this, the drug should not be withdrawn. Temporary interruption carries an increased risk of developing a sensitivity reaction upon resumption of therapy, although it may result in clinical improvement of neurological symptoms. If the neurological symptoms and signs continue to worsen for a month after the initiation of CUPRIMINE therapy, several short courses of treatment with 2,3 - dimercaprol (BAL) while continuing CUPRIMINE may be considered.\n- Treatment of asymptomatic patients has been carried out for over thirty years. Symptoms and signs of the disease appear to be prevented indefinitely if daily treatment with CUPRIMINE is continued.\n- Cystinuria is characterized by excessive urinary excretion of the dibasic amino acids, arginine, lysine, ornithine, and cystine, and the mixed disulfide of cysteine and homocysteine. The metabolic defect that leads to cystinuria is inherited as an autosomal, recessive trait. Metabolism of the affected amino acids is influenced by at least two abnormal factors:  defective gastrointestinal absorption and  renal tubular dysfunction.\n- Arginine, lysine, ornithine, and cysteine are soluble substances, readily excreted. There is no apparent pathology connected with their excretion in excessive quantities.\n- Cystine, however, is so slightly soluble at the usual range of urinary pH that it is not excreted readily, and so crystallizes and forms stones in the urinary tract. Stone formation is the only known pathology in cystinuria.\n- Normal daily output of cystine is 40 to 80 mg. In cystinuria, output is greatly increased and may exceed 1 g/day. At 500 to 600 mg/day, stone formation is almost certain. When it is more than 300 mg/day, treatment is indicated.\n- Conventional treatment is directed at keeping urinary cystine diluted enough to prevent stone formation, keeping the urine alkaline enough to dissolve as much cystine as possible, and minimizing cystine production by a diet low in methionine (the major dietary precursor of cystine). Patients must drink enough fluid to keep urine specific gravity below 1.010, take enough alkali to keep urinary pH at 7.5 to 8, and maintain a diet low in methionine. This diet is not recommended in growing children and probably is contraindicated in pregnancy because of its low protein content.\n- When these measures are inadequate to control recurrent stone formation, CUPRIMINE may be used as additional therapy, and when patients refuse to adhere to conventional treatment, CUPRIMINE may be a useful substitute. It is capable of keeping cystine excretion to near normal values, thereby hindering stone formation and the serious consequences of pyelonephritis and impaired renal function that develop in some patients. Bartter and colleagues depict the process by which penicillamine interacts with cystine to form penicillamine-cysteine mixed disulfide as:\n- In this process, it is assumed that the deprotonated form of penicillamine, PS', is the active factor in bringing about the disulfide interchange.\n- Because CUPRIMINE can cause severe adverse reactions, its use in rheumatoid arthritis should be restricted to patients who have severe, active disease and who have failed to respond to an adequate trial of conventional therapy. Even then, benefit-to-risk ratio should be carefully considered. Other measures, such as rest, physiotherapy, salicylates, and corticosteroids should be used, when indicated, in conjunction with CUPRIMINE\n\n【7】 ### Dosage\n- In all patients receiving penicillamine, it is important that CUPRIMINE be given on an empty stomach, at least one hour before meals or two hours after meals, and at least one hour apart from any other drug, food, or milk. Because penicillamine increases the requirement for pyridoxine, patients may require a daily supplement of pyridoxine\n- Optimal dosage can be determined by measurement of urinary copper excretion and the determination of free copper in the serum. The urine must be collected in copper-free glassware, and should be quantitatively analyzed for copper before and soon after initiation of therapy with CUPRIMINE.\n- Determination of 24-hour urinary copper excretion is of greatest value in the first week of therapy with penicillamine. In the absence of any drug reaction, a dose between 0.75 and 1.5 g that results in an initial 24-hour cupriuresis of over 2 mg should be continued for about three months, by which time the most reliable method of monitoring maintenance treatment is the determination of free copper in the serum. This equals the difference between quantitatively determined total copper and ceruloplasmin-copper. Adequately treated patients will usually have less than 10 mcg free copper/dL of serum. It is seldom necessary to exceed a dosage of 2 g/day. If the patient is intolerant to therapy with CUPRIMINE, alternative treatment is trientine hydrochloride.\n- In patients who cannot tolerate as much as 1 g/day initially, initiating dosage with 250 mg/day, and increasing gradually to the requisite amount, gives closer control of the effects of the drug and may help to reduce the incidence of adverse reactions.\n- It is recommended that CUPRIMINE be used along with conventional therapy. By reducing urinary cystine, it decreases crystalluria and stone formation. In some instances, it has been reported to decrease the size of, and even to dissolve, stones already formed.\n- The usual dosage of CUPRIMINE in the treatment of cystinuria is 2 g/day for adults, with a range of 1 to 4 g/day. For pediatric patients, dosage can be based on 30 mg/kg/day. The total daily amount should be divided into four doses. If four equal doses are not feasible, give the larger portion at bedtime. If adverse reactions necessitate a reduction in dosage, it is important to retain the bedtime dose.\n- Initiating dosage with 250 mg/day, and increasing gradually to the requisite amount, gives closer control of the effects of the drug and may help to reduce the incidence of adverse reactions.\n- In addition to taking CUPRIMINE, patients should drink copiously. It is especially important to drink about a pint of fluid at bedtime and another pint once during the night when urine is more concentrated and more acid than during the day. The greater the fluid intake, the lower the required dosage of CUPRIMINE.\n- Dosage must be individualized to an amount that limits cystine excretion to 100-200 mg/day in those with no history of stones, and below 100 mg/day in those who have had stone formation and/or pain. Thus, in determining dosage, the inherent tubular defect, the patient's size, age, and rate of growth, and his diet and water intake all must be taken into consideration.\n- The standard nitroprusside cyanide test has been reported useful as a qualitative measure of the effective dose:4 Add 2 mL of freshly prepared 5 percent sodium cyanide to 5 mL of a 24-hour aliquot of protein-free urine and let stand ten minutes. Add 5 drops of freshly prepared 5 percent sodium nitroprusside and mix. Cystine will turn the mixture magenta. If the result is negative, it can be assumed that cystine excretion is less than 100 mg/g creatinine.\n will turn the mixture magenta.If there is any question as to which substance is causing the reaction, a ferric chloride test can be done to eliminate doubt: Add 3 percent ferric chloride dropwise to the urine. Penicillamine will turn the urine an immediate and quickly fading blue. Cystine will not produce any change in appearance.\n- The principal rule of treatment with CUPRIMINE in rheumatoid arthritis is patience. The onset of therapeutic response is typically delayed. Two or three months may be required before the first evidence of a clinical response is noted.\n- When treatment with CUPRIMINE has been interrupted because of adverse reactions or other reasons, the drug should be reintroduced cautiously by starting with a lower dosage and increasing slowly.\n- The currently recommended dosage regimen in rheumatoid arthritis begins with a single daily dose of 125 mg or 250 mg, which is thereafter increased at one to three month intervals, by 125 mg or 250 mg/day, as patient response and tolerance indicate. If a satisfactory remission of symptoms is achieved, the dose associated with the remission should be continued. If there is no improvement and there are no signs of potentially serious toxicity after two to three months of treatment with doses of 500-750 mg/day, increases of 250 mg/day at two to three month intervals may be continued until a satisfactory remission occurs or signs of toxicity develop. If there is no discernible improvement after three to four months of treatment with 1000 to 1500 mg of penicillamine/day, it may be assumed the patient will not respond and CUPRIMINE should be discontinued.\n- The maintenance dosage of CUPRIMINE must be individualized, and may require adjustment during the course of treatment. Many patients respond satisfactorily to a dosage within the 500-750 mg/day range. Some need less.\n- Changes in maintenance dosage levels may not be reflected clinically or in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate for two to three months after each dosage adjustment.\n- Some patients will subsequently require an increase in the maintenance dosage to achieve maximal disease suppression. In those patients who do respond, but who evidence incomplete suppression of their disease after the first six to nine months of treatment, the daily dosage of CUPRIMINE may be increased by 125 mg or 250 mg/day at three-month intervals. It is unusual in current practice to employ a dosage in excess of 1 g/day, but up to 1.5 g/day has sometimes been required.\n- During the course of treatment some patients may experience an exacerbation of disease activity following an initial good response. These may be self-limited and can subside within twelve weeks. They are usually controlled by the addition of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and only if the patient has demonstrated a true \"escape\" phenomenon (as evidenced by failure of the flare to subside within this time period) should an increase in the maintenance dose ordinarily be considered.\n- In the rheumatoid patient, migratory polyarthralgia due to penicillamine is extremely difficult to differentiate from an exacerbation of the rheumatoid arthritis. Discontinuance or a substantial reduction in dosage of CUPRIMINE for up to several weeks will usually determine which of these processes is responsible for the arthralgia.\n- The optimum duration of therapy with CUPRIMINE in rheumatoid arthritis has not been determined. If the patient has been in remission for six months or more, a gradual, stepwise dosage reduction in decrements of 125 mg or 250 mg/day at approximately three month intervals may be attempted.\n- CUPRIMINE should not be used in patients who are receiving gold therapy, antimalarial or cytotoxic drugs, oxyphenbutazone, or phenylbutazone. Other measures, such as salicylates, other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or systemic corticosteroids, may be continued when penicillamine is initiated. After improvement commences, analgesic and anti-inflammatory drugs may be slowly discontinued as symptoms permit. Steroid withdrawal must be done gradually, and many months of treatment with CUPRIMINE may be required before steroids can be completely eliminated.\n- Based on clinical experience, dosages up to 500 mg/day can be given as a single daily dose. Dosages in excess of 500 mg/day should be administered in divided doses.\n\n【8】 ## Off-Label Use and Dosage (Adult)\n\n【9】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\n- Copper measurement, urine\n\n【10】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Penicillamine in adult patients.\n\n【11】 # Pediatric Indications and Dosage\n\n【12】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Pediatric)\nThere is limited information regarding FDA-Labeled Use of Penicillamine in pediatric patients.\n\n【13】 ## Off-Label Use and Dosage (Pediatric)\n\n【14】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Penicillamine in pediatric patients.\n\n【15】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Penicillamine in pediatric patients.\n\n【16】 # Contraindications\n- Except for the treatment of Wilson's disease or certain patients with cystinuria, use of penicillamine during pregnancy is contraindicated.\n- Although breast milk studies have not been reported in animals or humans, mothers on therapy with penicillamine should not nurse their infants.\n- Patients with a history of penicillamine-related aplastic anemia or agranulocytosis should not be restarted on penicillamine.\n- Because of its potential for causing renal damage, penicillamine should not be administered to rheumatoid arthritis patients with a history or other evidence of renal insufficiency.\n\n【17】 # Warnings\n- The use of penicillamine has been associated with fatalities due to certain diseases such as aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, Goodpasture's syndrome, and myasthenia gravis.\n- Because of the potential for serious hematological and renal adverse reactions to occur at any time, routine urinalysis, white and differential blood cell count, hemoglobin determination, and direct platelet count must be done twice weekly, together with monitoring of the patient's skin, lymph nodes and body temperature, during the first month of therapy, every two weeks for the next five months, and monthly thereafter. Patients should be instructed to report promptly the development of signs and symptoms of granulocytopenia and/or thrombocytopenia such as fever, sore throat, chills, bruising or bleeding. The above laboratory studies should then be promptly repeated.\n- Leukopenia and thrombocytopenia have been reported to occur in up to five percent of patients during penicillamine therapy. Leukopenia is of the granulocytic series and may or may not be associated with an increase in eosinophils. A confirmed reduction in WBC below 3500/mm3 mandates discontinuance of penicillamine therapy. Thrombocytopenia may be on an idiosyncratic basis, with decreased or absent megakaryocytes in the marrow, when it is part of an aplastic anemia. In other cases the thrombocytopenia is presumably on an immune basis since the number of megakaryocytes in the marrow has been reported to be normal or sometimes increased. The development of a platelet count below 100,000/mm3, even in the absence of clinical bleeding, requires at least temporary cessation of penicillamine therapy. A progressive fall in either platelet count or WBC in three successive determinations, even though values are still within the normal range, likewise requires at least temporary cessation.\n- Proteinuria and/or hematuria may develop during therapy and may be warning signs of membranous glomerulopathy which can progress to a nephrotic syndrome. Close observation of these patients is essential. In some patients the proteinuria disappears with continued therapy; in others, penicillamine must be discontinued. When a patient develops proteinuria or hematuria the physician must ascertain whether it is a sign of drug-induced glomerulopathy or is unrelated to penicillamine.\n- Rheumatoid arthritis patients who develop moderate degrees of proteinuria may be continued cautiously on penicillamine therapy, provided that quantitative 24-hour urinary protein determinations are obtained at intervals of one to two weeks. Penicillamine dosage should not be increased under these circumstances. Proteinuria which exceeds 1 g/24 hours, or proteinuria which is progressively increasing, requires either discontinuance of the drug or a reduction in the dosage. In some patients, proteinuria has been reported to clear following reduction in dosage.\n- In rheumatoid arthritis patients penicillamine should be discontinued if unexplained gross hematuria or persistent microscopic hematuria develops.\n- In patients with Wilson's disease or cystinuria the risks of continued penicillamine therapy in patients manifesting potentially serious urinary abnormalities must be weighed against the expected therapeutic benefits.\n- When penicillamine is used in cystinuria, an annual x-ray for renal stones is advised. Cystine stones form rapidly, sometimes in six months. Up to one year or more may be required for any urinary abnormalities to disappear after penicillamine has been discontinued.\n- Because of rare reports of intrahepatic cholestasis and toxic hepatitis, liver function tests are recommended every six months for the duration of therapy. In Wilson's disease, these are recommended every three months, at least during the first year of treatment.\n- Goodpasture's syndrome has occurred rarely. The development of abnormal urinary findings associated with hemoptysis and pulmonary infiltrates on x-ray requires immediate cessation of penicillamine.\n- Obliterative bronchiolitis has been reported rarely. The patient should be cautioned to report immediately pulmonary symptoms such as exertional dyspnea, unexplained cough or wheezing. Pulmonary function studies should be considered at that time.\n- Onset of new neurological symptoms has been reported with CUPRIMINE. Occasionally, neurological symptoms become worse during initiation of therapy with CUPRIMINE. Myasthenic syndrome sometimes progressing to myasthenia gravis has been reported. Ptosis and diplopia, with weakness of the extraocular muscles, are often early signs of myasthenia. In the majority of cases, symptoms of myasthenia have receded after withdrawal of penicillamine.\n- Most of the various forms of pemphigus have occurred during treatment with penicillamine. Pemphigus vulgaris and pemphigus foliaceus are reported most frequently, usually as a late complication of therapy. The seborrhea-like characteristics of pemphigus foliaceus may obscure an early diagnosis. When pemphigus is suspected, CUPRIMINE should be discontinued. Treatment has consisted of high doses of corticosteroids alone or, in some cases, concomitantly with an immunosuppressant. Treatment may be required for only a few weeks or months, but may need to be continued for more than a year.\n- Once instituted for Wilson's disease or cystinuria, treatment with penicillamine should, as a rule, be continued on a daily basis. Interruptions for even a few days have been followed by sensitivity reactions after reinstitution of therapy.\n- Reported experience3 shows that continued treatment with penicillamine throughout pregnancy protects the mother against relapse of the Wilson's disease, and that discontinuation of penicillamine has deleterious effects on the mother, which may be fatal.\n- If penicillamine is administered during pregnancy to patients with Wilson's disease, it is recommended that the daily dosage be limited to 750 mg. If cesarean section is planned the daily dose should be reduced to 250 mg, but not lower, for the last six weeks of pregnancy and postoperatively until wound healing is complete.\n- If possible, penicillamine should not be given during pregnancy to women with cystinuria. There are reports of women with cystinuria on therapy with penicillamine who gave birth to infants with generalized connective tissue defects who died following abdominal surgery. If stones continue to form in these patients, the benefits of therapy to the mother must be evaluated against the risk to the fetus.\n- Penicillamine should not be administered to rheumatoid arthritis patients who are pregnant and should be discontinued promptly in patients in whom pregnancy is suspected or diagnosed. There is a report that a woman with rheumatoid arthritis treated with less than one gram a day of penicillamine during pregnancy gave birth (cesarean delivery) to an infant with growth retardation, flattened face with broad nasal bridge, low set ears, short neck with loose skin folds, and unusually lax body skin.\n\n【18】 ### Precautions\n- Some patients may experience drug fever, a marked febrile response to penicillamine, usually in the second to third week following initiation of therapy. Drug fever may sometimes be accompanied by a macular cutaneous eruption. In the case of drug fever in patients with Wilson's disease or cystinuria, penicillamine should be temporarily discontinued until the reaction subsides. Then penicillamine should be reinstituted with a small dose that is gradually increased until the desired dosage is attained. Systemic steroid therapy may be necessary, and is usually helpful, in such patients in whom drug fever and rash develop several times.\n- In the case of drug fever in rheumatoid arthritis patients, because other treatments are available, penicillamine should be discontinued and another therapeutic alternative tried since experience indicates that the febrile reaction will recur in a very high percentage of patients upon readministration of penicillamine.\n- The skin and mucous membranes should be observed for allergic reactions. Early and late rashes have occurred. Early rash occurs during the first few months of treatment and is more common. It is usually a generalized pruritic, erythematous, maculopapular or morbilliform rash and resembles the allergic rash seen with other drugs. Early rash usually disappears within days after stopping penicillamine and seldom recurs when the drug is restarted at a lower dosage. Pruritus and early rash may often be controlled by the concomitant administration of antihistamines. Less commonly, a late rash may be seen, usually after six months or more of treatment, and requires discontinuation of penicillamine. It is usually on the trunk, is accompanied by intense pruritus, and is usually unresponsive to topical corticosteroid therapy. Late rash may take weeks to disappear after penicillamine is stopped and usually recurs if the drug is restarted.\n- The appearance of a drug eruption accompanied by fever, arthralgia, lymphadenopathy or other allergic manifestations usually requires discontinuation of penicillamine.\n- Certain patients will develop a positive antinuclear antibody (ANA) test and some of these may show a lupus erythematosus-like syndrome similar to drug-induced lupus associated with other drugs. The lupus erythematosus-like syndrome is not associated with hypocomplementemia and may be present without nephropathy. The development of a positive ANA test does not mandate discontinuance of the drug; however, the physician should be alerted to the possibility that a lupus erythematosus-like syndrome may develop in the future.\n been reported. These oral lesions are frequently dose-related and may preclude further increase in penicillamine dosage or require discontinuation of the drug.\n- Hypogeusia (a blunting or diminution in taste perception) has occurred in some patients. This may last two to three months or more and may develop into a total loss of taste; however, it is usually self-limited despite continued penicillamine treatment. Such taste impairment is rare in patients with Wilson's disease.\n associated with similar serious hematologic and renal adverse reactions.\n- Patients who have had gold salt therapy discontinued due to a major toxic reaction may be at greater risk of serious adverse reactions with penicillamine but not necessarily of the same type.\n- Patients who are allergic to penicillin may theoretically have cross-sensitivity to penicillamine. The possibility of reactions from contamination of penicillamine by trace amounts of penicillin has been eliminated now that penicillamine is being produced synthetically rather than as a degradation product of penicillin.\n may receive benefit from a multivitamin preparation, although there is no evidence that deficiency of any vitamin other than pyridoxine is associated with penicillamine. In Wilson's disease, multivitamin preparations must be copper-free.\n low in iron, and the penicillamine to the effects of blood loss or growth. In cystinuria, a low methionine diet may contribute to iron deficiency, since it is necessarily low in protein. If necessary, iron may be given in short courses, but a period of two hours should elapse between administration of penicillamine and iron, since orally administered iron has been shown to reduce the effects of penicillamine.\n a decrease in tensile strength of intact skin. In man this may be the cause of increased skin friability at sites especially subject to pressure or trauma, such as shoulders, elbows, knees, toes, and buttocks. Extravasations of blood may occur and may appear as purpuric areas, with external bleeding if the skin is broken, or as vesicles containing dark blood. Neither type is progressive. There is no apparent association with bleeding elsewhere in the body and no associated coagulation defect has been found. Therapy with penicillamine may be continued in the presence of these lesions. They may not recur if dosage is reduced. Other reported effects probably due to the action of penicillamine on collagen are excessive wrinkling of the skin and development of small, white papules at venipuncture and surgical sites.\n- The effects of penicillamine on collagen and elastin make it advisable to consider a reduction in dosage to 250 mg/day, when surgery is contemplated. Reinstitution of full therapy should be delayed until wound healing is complete.\n- Long-term animal carcinogenicity studies have not been done with penicillamine. There is a report that five of ten autoimmune disease-prone NZB hybrid mice developed lymphocytic leukemia after 6 months' intraperitoneal treatment with a dose of 400 mg/kg penicillamine 5 days per week.\n- Penicillamine is directly mutagenic to S. typhimurium strain TA92 in the Ames test; mutagenicity is enhanced by kidney postmitochondrial subcellular fraction 9. Penicillamine does not induce gene mutations in Chinese hamster V79 cells.\n- Penicillamine induces sister-chromatid exchanges and chromosome aberrations in cultivated mammalian cells. No studies on the effect of penicillamine on fertility are available.\n\n【19】 # Adverse Reactions\n\n【20】 ## Clinical Trials Experience\n- Penicillamine is a drug with a high incidence of untoward reactions, some of which are potentially fatal. Therefore, it is mandatory that patients receiving penicillamine therapy remain under close medical supervision throughout the period of drug administration.\n- Reported incidences (%) for the most commonly occurring adverse reactions in rheumatoid arthritis patients are noted, based on 17 representative clinical trials reported in the literature (1270 patients).\n- Generalized pruritus, early and late rashes (5%), pemphigus, and drug eruptions which may be accompanied by fever, arthralgia, or lymphadenopathy have occurred. Some patients may show a lupus erythematosus-like syndrome similar to drug-induced lupus produced by other pharmacological agents.\n- Urticaria and exfoliative dermatitis have occurred.\n- Thyroiditis has been reported; hypoglycemia in association with anti-insulin antibodies has been reported. These reactions are extremely rare.\n- Some patients may develop a migratory polyarthralgia, often with objective synovitis.\n- Anorexia, epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting, or occasional diarrhea may occur (17%).\n- Isolated cases of reactivated peptic ulcer have occurred, as have hepatic dysfunction including hepatic failure, and pancreatitis. Intrahepatic cholestasis and toxic hepatitis have been reported rarely. There have been a few reports of increased serum alkaline phosphatase, lactic dehydrogenase, and positive cephalin flocculation and thymol turbidity tests.\n- Some patients may report a blunting, diminution, or total loss of taste perception (12%); or may develop oral ulcerations. Although rare, cheilosis, glossitis, and gingivostomatitis have been reported.\n- Gastrointestinal side effects are usually reversible following cessation of therapy.\n- Penicillamine can cause bone marrow depression. Leukopenia (2%) and thrombocytopenia (4%) have occurred. Fatalities have been reported as a result of thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, and sideroblastic anemia.\n been reported.\n- Patients on penicillamine therapy may develop proteinuria (6%) and/or hematuria which, in some, may progress to the development of the nephrotic syndrome as a result of an immune complex membranous glomerulopathy . Renal failure has been reported.\n- Tinnitus, optic neuritis and peripheral sensory and motor neuropathies (including polyradiculoneuropathy, i.e., Guillain-Barré syndrome) have been reported. Muscular weakness may or may not occur with the peripheral neuropathies. Visual and psychic disturbances; mental disorders; and agitation and anxiety have been reported.\n- Myasthenia gravis ; dystonia.\n has been reported.\n- Increased skin friability, excessive wrinkling of skin, and development of small white papules at venipuncture and surgical sites have been reported; yellow nail syndrome.\n- The chelating action of the drug may cause increased excretion of other heavy metals such as zinc, mercury and lead.\n- There have been reports associating penicillamine with leukemia. However, circumstances involved in these reports are such that a cause and effect relationship to the drug has not been established.\n\n【21】 ## Postmarketing Experience\nThere is limited information regarding Postmarketing Experience of Penicillamine in the drug label.\n\n【22】 # Drug Interactions\n associated with similar serious hematologic and renal adverse reactions.\n- Patients who are allergic to penicillin may theoretically have cross-sensitivity to penicillamine. The possibility of reactions from contamination of penicillamine by trace amounts of penicillin has been eliminated now that penicillamine is being produced synthetically rather than as a degradation product of penicillin.\n\n【23】 # Use in Specific Populations\n\n【24】 ### Pregnancy\nPregnancy Category (FDA): D\n- Penicillamine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Penicillamine has been shown to be teratogenic in rats when given in doses 6 times higher than the highest dose recommended for human use. Skeletal defects, cleft palates and fetal toxicity (resorptions) have been reported.\n- There are no controlled studies on the use of penicillamine in pregnant women. Although normal outcomes have been reported, characteristic congenital cutis laxa and associated birth defects have been reported in infants born of mothers who received therapy with penicillamine during pregnancy. Penicillamine should be used in women of childbearing potential only when the expected benefits outweigh the possible hazards. Women on therapy with penicillamine who are of childbearing potential should be apprised of this risk, advised to report promptly any missed menstrual periods or other indications of possible pregnancy, and followed closely for early recognition of pregnancy. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.\nPregnancy Category (AUS):\n- There is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Penicillamine in women who are pregnant.\n\n【25】 ### Labor and Delivery\nThere is no FDA guidance on use of Penicillamine during labor and delivery.\n\n【26】 ### Nursing Mothers\n- Although breast milk studies have not been reported in animals or humans, mothers on therapy with penicillamine should not nurse their infants.\n\n【27】 ### Pediatric Use\n- The efficacy of CUPRIMINE in juvenile rheumatoid arthritis has not been established.\n\n【28】 ### Geriatic Use\n- Clinical studies of CUPRIMINE are limited in subjects aged 65 and over; they did not include sufficient numbers of elderly subjects aged 65 and over to adequately determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Review of reported clinical trials with penicillamine in the elderly suggest greater risk than in younger patients for overall skin rash and abnormality of taste. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drugs.\n- This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and careful monitoring of renal function is recommended.\n\n【29】 ### Gender\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Penicillamine with respect to specific gender populations.\n\n【30】 ### Race\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Penicillamine with respect to specific racial populations.\n\n【31】 ### Renal Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Penicillamine in patients with renal impairment.\n\n【32】 ### Hepatic Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Penicillamine in patients with hepatic impairment.\n\n【33】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Penicillamine in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n\n【34】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\nThere is no FDA guidance one the use of Penicillamine in patients who are immunocompromised.\n\n【35】 # Administration and Monitoring\n\n【36】 ### Administration\n- In all patients receiving penicillamine, it is important that CUPRIMINE be given on an empty stomach, at least one hour before meals or two hours after meals, and at least one hour apart from any other drug, food, or milk. Because penicillamine increases the requirement for pyridoxine, patients may require a daily supplement of pyridoxine\n\n【37】 ### Monitoring\n- Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and careful monitoring of renal function is recommended.\n- Because of the potential for serious hematological and renal adverse reactions to occur at any time, routine urinalysis, white and differential blood cell count, hemoglobin determination, and direct platelet count must be done twice weekly, together with monitoring of the patient's skin, lymph nodes and body temperature, during the first month of therapy, every two weeks for the next five months, and monthly thereafter.\n\n【38】 # IV Compatibility\nThere is limited information regarding IV Compatibility of Penicillamine in the drug label.\n\n【39】 # Overdosage\nThere is limited information regarding Penicillamine overdosage.  If you suspect drug poisoning or overdose, please contact the National Poison Help hotline (1-800-222- immediately.\n\n【40】 # Pharmacology\n\n【41】 ## Mechanism of Action\n- Penicillamine is a chelating agent recommended for the removal of excess copper in patients with Wilson's disease\n reduces excess cystine excretion in cystinuria. This is done, at least in part, by disulfide interchange between penicillamine and cystine, resulting in formation of penicillamine-cysteine disulfide, a substance that is much more soluble than cystine and is excreted readily.\n- Penicillamine interferes with the formation of cross-links between tropocollagen molecules and cleaves them when newly formed.\n- The mechanism of action of penicillamine in rheumatoid arthritis is unknown although it appears to suppress disease activity. Unlike cytotoxic immunosuppressants, penicillamine markedly lowers IgM rheumatoid factor but produces no significant depression in absolute levels of serum immunoglobulins. Also unlike cytotoxic immunosuppressants which act on both, penicillamine in vitro depresses T-cell activity but not B-cell activity.\n- In vitro, penicillamine dissociates macroglobulins (rheumatoid factor) although the relationship of the activity to its effect in rheumatoid arthritis is not known.\n- In rheumatoid arthritis, the onset of therapeutic response to CUPRIMINE may not be seen for two or three months. In those patients who respond, however, the first evidence of suppression of symptoms such as pain, tenderness, and swelling is generally apparent within three months. The optimum duration of therapy has not been determined. If remissions occur, they may last from months to years, but usually require continued treatment.\n- In all patients receiving penicillamine, it is important that CUPRIMINE be given on an empty stomach, at least one hour before meals or two hours after meals, and at least one hour apart from any other drug, food, milk, antacid, zinc or iron-containing preparation. This permits maximum absorption and reduces the likelihood of inactivation by metal binding in the gastrointestinal tract.\n\n【42】 ## Structure\n- The empirical formula is C5H11NO2S, giving it a molecular weight of 149.21. The structural formula is:\n\n【43】 ## Pharmacodynamics\nThere is limited information regarding Pharmacodynamics of Penicillamine in the drug label.\n\n【44】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n- Penicillamine is absorbed rapidly but incompletely (40-70%) from the gastrointestinal tract, with wide interindividual variations. Food, antacids, and iron reduce absorption of the drug. The peak plasma concentration of penicillamine occurs 1-3 hours after ingestion; it is approximately 1-2 mg/L after an oral dose of 250 mg. The drug appears in the plasma as free penicillamine, penicillamine disulfide, and cysteine-penicillamine disulfide. When prolonged treatment is stopped, there is a slow elimination phase lasting 4-6 days.\n binds to erythrocytes and macrophages. A small fraction of the dose is metabolized in the liver to S-methyl-D-penicillamine.

While her father was more directly associated with healing, she was associated with the prevention of sickness and the continuation of good health.\nHygieia was the subject of a local cult since at least the 7th century BC, (it is highly probable that Greek hygiene and health development began from influences of the Celts and the world's first hospital situated in Armagh Ireland. It was built before 650 BC by Queen Macha.) \"Athena Hygieia\" was one of the titles given to Athene, as Plutarch recounts:\nHowever, the cult of Hygieia as an independent goddess did not begin to spread out until the Oracle at Delphi recognized her, and after the devastating Athens plague in 429 and 427 BC and in Rome in 293 BC.  Her primary temples were in Epidaurus, Corinth, Cos and Pergamon. Pausanias remarked that, at the asclepieion of Titane in Sicyon (founded by Alexanor, Asclepius' grandson), statues of Hygieia were covered by women's hair and pieces of Babylonian clothes.  According to inscriptions, the same sacrifices were offered at Paros.\nAriphron, a Sicyonian artist from the 4th century BC wrote a well-known hymn celebrating her.  Statues of Hygieia were created by Scopas, Bryaxis and Timotheus, among others. She was often depicted as a young woman feeding a large snake that was wrapped around her body.  Sometimes the snake would be drinking from a jar that she carried. These attributes were later adopted by the Gallo-Roman healing goddess, Sirona. Hygieia was accompanied by her brother, Telesphorus.

In Canada, approximately 8% of men with prostate cancer are diagnosed de novo with metastatic disease and, in 2018, roughly 1200 men were diagnosed with de novo metastatic prostate cancer (PCa). 1 The mainstay of treatment for de novo metastatic PCa is androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), either surgical or medical castration, which is initially effective in almost all patients; however, progression is inevi, heralded by a rise in prostate-specific antigen (PSA), increasing disease burden, and/or worsening symptoms -a disease state called metastatic castrationresistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).\nMen with metastatic PCa have a poor prognosis, with an estimated median overall survival (OS) of approximately 3-4 years. 2 Compared to PCa that develops metastases after diagnosis of localized disease, de novo metastatic PCa has been shown to have a worse overall prognosis. 3,4 Over the past decade, practice-changing trials have demonstrated improved survival in men with metastatic castration-naive/ castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCNPC/mCSPC) using ADT intensification strategies that include both systemic therapy and treatment of the primary cancer.\nThe Canadian Uro-Oncology Group (CUOG), in collaboration with the Canadian Urological Association (CUA), sought to provide management guidelines to optimize the treatment of patients with mCNPC/mCSPC.\n\n【1】 # Methods\nEmBASE and Medline databases were accessed to identify all relevant articles focused on mCNPC or mCSPC published between January 2000 and April 2022 with the following keywords strategy: \"prostate cancer,\" \"hormone sensitive,\" \"castration naive,\" \"castration sensitive,\" \"androgen deprivation,\" \"chemotherapy,\" \"androgen receptor-axis targeted therapy,\" and \"metastatic.\" An expert panel comprised of urologists, medical oncologists, and radiation oncologists with significant experience managing mCNPC/mCSPC developed the recommendations. Guidelines were developed by consensus among the panel. Levels of evidence and grades of recommendation employ the WHO modified Oxford Center for Evidence-Based Medicine grading system. 5 Based on a modified GRADE methodology, the strength of each recommendation is represented by the words strong or weak. 5 Wherever level 1 evidence is lacking, the guideline attempts to provide expert opinion to aid in the management of patients.\n\n【2】 # Indications for staging in prostate cancer\nFor patients with newly diagnosed PCa, staging with computed tomogragphy (CT) scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, and bone scan ( 99 mTc-MDP) should be performed for men with any high-risk features: PSA >20 ng/mL, Gleason score >7, clinical stage T3 or greater (Level of evidence 3, Strong recommendation).\n be considered, as lung metastases are the most common site of visceral metastases. 6 Novel diagnostic imaging to stage PCa, particularly prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeted positron emission tomography (PET)/CT, improves the sensitivity and specificity of conventional imaging; however, these tests are not universally available Canada, and they are still considered investigational by Health Canada. Most importantly, all the phase 3 trials in mCNPC/mCSPC used conventional imaging for staging and risk determination, and conclusions were based on these.\n\n【3】 # Assessment of prognosis\n\n【4】 # Patients diagnosed with mPCa should be classified as highvolume/high-risk or low-volume/low-risk based on conventional imaging and prostate cancer biopsy for prognostication (Level of evidence 2, Weak recommendation).\nRecent clinical trials of patients with mCNPC/mCSPC have used pragmatic prognostic factors to stratify prognosis. The CHAARTED trial classified PCa based on volume of disease. High-volume was defined by the presence of visceral metastases or ≥4 bone lesions with ≥1 beyond the vertebral bodies and pelvis; and low-volume was defined as all other mCNPC/mCSPC. 7 The LATITUDE trial classified high-risk patients based on three different criteria: visceral metastases, ≥3 bony metastases, or Gleason score ≥8; high risk was defined as having two or more of these criteria, whereas low risk was defined having less than two. 8 Interestingly, a comparative study of the classification of each of these trials showed an overall discordance of 18.2% between the CHAARTED and LATITUDE criterion; however, it appears that disease burden (defined radiologically or by PSA) and high-grade tumors portend a worse prognosis. 9 \n\n【5】 # Androgen deprivation therapy\n\n【6】 # ADT should be started on patients with newly diagnosed with mPCa (Level of evidence 1, Strong recommendation).\nContinuous ADT is the standard of care for patients with mPCa, while intermittent may be considered in select patients.\nAndrogen receptor signaling plays a key role in the progression of PCa, and thus, de novo mCNPC remains highly driven by testosterone. Hence, the primary step in the management of mCNPC, which remains the backbone of treatment for all men with mPCa until death, is ADT. ADT can be achieved by surgical castration (orchiectomy) or pharmacologically with agents that inhibit Leydig cell production of testosterone (gonadotropin-releasing hormone  agonists or antagonists). The optimal timing of androgen deprivation has been the subject of many trials, with two systematic reviews suggesting early treatment is associated with improved OS and cancer-specific survival and decreases the rate of skeletal events compared to deferred treatment. 10,11 More importantly, the early treatment of mCNPC with ADT is required if other systemic treatment, such as docetaxel or androgen receptor axis inhibitors, are used.\nADT is associated with side effects and may increase the risk of cardiovascular events, but evidence has been contradictory. Intermittent androgen suppression (IAS) that cycles ADT based on PSA values has been shown to improve quality of life; however, continuous ADT should be used in mCNPC and IAS only used as an exception in select patients with close followup. 12,13 As well, the benefit of combined treatment of mCNPC with additional systemic therapy was demonstrated in the context of continuous ADT.\n\n【7】 # Local therapy: treatment of the primary cancer in mCNPC\n\n【8】 # Patients with low-volume metastatic disease burden of PCa should be considered for external beam radiation to the prostate (Level of evidence 2, Strong recommendation).\nIn the context of low-volume mCNPC, treatment of the primary disease in the prostate has theoretical benefits, including reducing local side effects that may occur due to local disease progression, as well as removing the cancer that could be the source of cytokines and growth factors that may induce disease progression. 14 Two recent randomized trials assessed the impact of external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) in mCNPC. The HORRAD trial randomized 432 men with mCNPC and PSA >20 ng/mL to receive EBRT of the prostate with ADT or ADT alone. The initial prescribed dose was 70 Gy in 35 fractions of 2 Gy, during an overall treatment time of seven weeks. During the study period, an optional schedule considered biologically Guideline: mCNPC & mCSPC equivalent was added and consisted of a dose schedule of 57.7 Gy in 19 fractions of 3.04 Gy three times a week for six weeks. At baseline, the median PSA was 142 ng/ml and 67% of patients had more than five bone metastases. No significant difference was found in OS (hazard ratio  0.90, 95% confidence interval  0.70-1.14, p = 0., but there was a benefit to median time to PSA progression in the radiotherapy group (15 months vs. 12 months, crude HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.63-0.97, p=0.. Subgroup analysis showed that mCNPC with <5 metastases (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.70-1.14, p=NS) and no bony pain (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.69-1.14, p=NS) appeared to have the most benefit of EBRT.\n known as MRC PR08, is a multiarm, multistage (MAMS) randomized trial recruiting in the United Kingdom and Switzerland. It aimed to evaluate multiple therapeutic strategies in the management of high-risk locally advanced and mCNPC compared to standard of care (SOC) (ADT only). In the EBRT component of the study, the trial randomized 2061 men with mCNPC to either EBRT and ADT or ADT alone. 15 The median PSA was 97 ng/mL, 819 (40%) men had low metastatic burden based on CHAARTED criteria, and 1664 (81%) had no pain. 7,15 EBRT was given as one of two schedules: either 36 Gy in six consecutive weekly fractions of 6 Gy, or 55 Gy in 20 daily fractions of 2.75 Gy over four weeks. Subgroup analyses were prespecified for baseline metastatic burden (low vs. high).\nSimilar to the HORRAD trial, EBRT improved failure-free survival (FFS) (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.68-0.84, p<0. but not OS (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.80-1.06, p=0.. Subgroup analysis by metastatic burden showed FFS was improved in both low and high metastatic burden (low metastatic burden: HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.49-0.72, p<0.0001 and metastatic burden interaction p=0.002; HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.77-1.01, p=0.. Overall survival was improved in patients with low metastatic burden at baseline who were allocated EBRT (HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.52-0.90, p=0., whereas in patients with a high metastatic burden, there was no impact on OS (HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.90-1.28, p=0..\nAlthough both trials showed a lack of benefit of EBRT in unselected men in mCNPC, both HORRAD and STAMPEDE reveal the benefits of local therapy in those with low-burden disease. A recent STOPCAP meta-analysis combining data from the trials confirm the benefits of EBRT in men with fewer than five bone metastases. 16 This meta-analysis showed that there was 7% improvement in three-year survival in men with fewer than four bone metastases.\n\n【9】 # Radical prostatectomy in mCNPC should only be performed in a clinical trial setting (Expert opinion, Strong recommendation).\n be certain men with mCNPC that may benefit from surgical extirpation. There are many clinical trials currently assessing this question, including TRoMBONE (Testing Radical prOstatectomy in Men with PCa and oligometastases to the BONE: A randomized controlled feasibility trial), 17 SWOG1802 (Standard systemic therapy with or without definitive treatment in treating participants with mPCa ), G-RAMPP/AUO-AP-75/13 (Impact of radical prostatectomy as primary treatment in patients with PCa with limited bone metastases), 18 and IP2-ATLANTA (Additional Treatments to the Local tumor for metastatic prostate cancer -Assessment of Novel Treatment Algorithms: Protocol for a multicenter, phase 2, randomized controlled trial). 19 Until the results of these trials clarify the impact of radical prostatectomy in mCNPC, and more importantly, which patients would benefit most, surgery of the primary is not recommended in patients with mPCa.\nSystemic therapies: chemotherapy, abiraterone acetate, enzalutamide, and apalutamide Docetaxel (75 mg/m 2 every three weeks for six cycles) plus ADT is an option for patients with mCNPC/mCSPC, good performance status, and high-volume metastatic disease defined as: presence of visceral metastases or four or more bone lesions with at least one beyond the vertebral bodies and pelvis (Level of evidence 1, Strong recommendation).\n\n【10】  be an option for patients with mCNPC/mCSPC and good performance status with low-volume disease (Level of evidence 2, Weak recommendation).\n be considered for docetaxel chemotherapy (Level of evidence 1, Strong recommendation). Docetaxel, a taxane derivative that binds to tubulin and inhibits mitosis and tumor proliferation, was the initial chemotherapeutic agent that improved survival in men mCRPC. 20 Three large, randomized trials assessed the impact of introducing docetaxel in mCNPC/mCSPC: CHAARTED, STAMPEDE, and GETUG-AFU 15. 7,21,22 The CHAARTED trial randomized 790 with mCNPC/mCSPC patients to ADT plus docetaxel (75 mg/m 2 every three weeks for six cycles) or ADT alone. 7 Within this trial, 35% (n= had low-volume metastases and 65% (n= had high-volume metastases (high volume of metastases was defined by the presence of visceral metastases or four or more bone lesions with at least one beyond the vertebral bodies and pelvis). Overall, the median OS was 13.6 months longer with ADT plus docetaxel than with ADT alone (57.6 months vs. 44.0 months; HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.47-0.80, p<0.. Subgroup analysis showed that OS benefits of combination there were maintained in the high-volume mCNPC/mCSPC (n=513, HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.50-0.79, p<0., whereas survival benefits were lost in low-volume disease (n=277, HR 1.04, 95% CI 0.70-1.55, p=0.. 23 The GETUG-AFU15 trial randomized 385 patients with mCNPC/mCSPC to receive ADT plus docetaxel or ADT alone. 22 Although the dosage of docetaxel was the same as in CHAARTED, patients were allowed to receive up to nine cycles compared to the six cycles in CHAARTED. There was no survival difference between the groups (58.9 months in the combined group vs. 54.2 months in the ADT alone group, HR 1.01, 95% CI 0.75-1.. The differences in the outcomes of the two studies is likely due to the differences in the burden of disease in the two studies. Although 65% of patients in CHAARTED had high-volume metastases, only 48% in the docetaxel arm of GETUG-AFU15 had high-volume disease. An unplanned post-hoc analysis of the high-volume cohort of GETUG-AFU 15 showed a nonsignificant trend toward improved OS in this cohort (39.8 months vs. 35.1 months, HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.56-1.. 24 A recent pooled analysis of both studies confirms the benefit of combined docetaxel and ADT in high-volume disease and lack of benefit on low-volume metastatic burden. 25 The third trial to assess the impact of docetaxel in mCNPC/ mCSPC was the docetaxel component of the STAMPEDE trial. 21 Unlike the CHAARTED and GETUG-AFU15 trials, patients with high-risk non-metastatic PCa were included. Eligible patients included: newly diagnosed metastatic, node-positive, or high-risk locally advanced (with high-risk features defined as at least two of: T3/4, Gleason score of 8-10, and PSA ≥40 ng/mL) prostate cancer; or previously treated with radical surgery and/or radiotherapy with highrisk features. Of the 2962 patients randomized, 1817 (61%) patients had bony metastases and 592 patients received only ADT and six cycles of docetaxel (75 mg/m 2 every three weeks for six cycles). The combination of ADT and docetaxel had a survival advantage compared to ADT alone (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.66-0.93, p=0.. Although patients were not classified having high-or low-volume metastases, only patients with metastatic disease had evidence of benefit with ADT and docetaxel (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.62-0.92, p=0..\nA post-hoc, non-prespecified analysis of STAMPEDE was published. 26 Metastatic burden was assessable in only 76% of patients for the analysis (830 of 1086 patients) and 362 (44%) had low and 468 (56%) high metastatic burden. Although OS was neither statistically significant in low-burden nor in high-burden disease (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.54-1.07, p=0.107 vs. HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.64-1.02, p=0., the authors found no evidence of heterogeneity of docetaxel effect between metastatic burden subgroups (interaction p=0.. The authors concluded that upfront docetaxel should be considered for patients with mCNPC/mCSPC regardless of metastatic burden. This retrospective analysis contradicts the results of CHAARTED, but the authors point out that this may be due to the larger number of patients with de novo mCNPC/mCSPC (n= in the low-burden group compared to the low-burden group in the CHAARTED trial (n<.\nA recent meta-analysis of CHAARTED, GETUG-AFU15, and STAMPEDE confirms the benefit of the addition of docetaxel to ADT for patients with mCNPC/mCSPC (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.68-0.87, p<0.. The authors of the metaanalysis show that this translates to an absolute improvement in four-year survival of 9%.\nAbiraterone acetate (1000 mg daily) with prednisone (5 mg daily) plus ADT is an option for patients with mCNPC with at least two of the three: (Gleason score of ≥8, presence of three or more lesions on bone scan, or presence of measurable visceral metastasis) (Level of evidence 1, Strong recommendation).\n\n【11】 # Abiraterone acetate (1000 mg daily) with prednisone (5 mg daily) plus ADT may be considered for patients with low-volume mCNPC (Level of evidence 3, Weak recommendation).\nAbiraterone acetate is a prodrug of abiraterone, which is a CYP17A1 inhibitor; CYP17A1 is expressed in and is required for androgen biosynthesis. Abiraterone acetate, when combined with prednisone, was initially shown to improve survival in mCRPC, both prior to and after docetaxel treatment. 27,28 Two trials, LATITUDE and STAMPEDE, assessed the impact of abiraterone in mCNPC/mCSPC. 8,29,30 In the LATITUDE trial, 1199 patients were randomly assigned to either the abiraterone acetate (1000 mg) plus prednisone (5 mg) once daily orally and ADT vs. ADT alone. Eligible patients included patients with mCNPC with at least two of three high-risk features (Gleason score of ≥8, presence of three or more lesions on bone scan, or presence of measurable visceral metastasis except lymph node metastasis). Updated OS data with median followup of 51.8 months showed that OS was significantly longer in the abiraterone acetate plus prednisone group (median 53.3 months ) than in the placebo group (median 36.5 months ), with a HR of 0.66 (95% CI 0.56−0.78, p<. A post-hoc exploratory analysis of the impact of disease burden showed that OS was improved only in patients with high-volume disease (n=487 in the abiraterone acetate plus prednisone and ADT and 468 in the ADT only group ); however, only few patients had low-volume disease in this study (n=110 in the abiraterone acetate plus prednisone and ADT and n=133 in the ADT only group (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.47−1.10, p=0..\n\n【12】 # Guideline: mCNPC & mCSPC\nIn the abiraterone component of the STAMPEDE trial, the efficacy of abiraterone acetate and prednisolone was assessed in men with mCNPC. 29 In this study, 1917 patients with mCNPC were enrolled with: newly diagnosed and metastatic, node-positive, or high-risk locally advanced prostate cancer (with at least two of following: cT3 or cT4, a Gleason score of 8−10, or PSA level ≥40 ng/mL) or disease that was previously treated with radical surgery or radiotherapy and was now relapsing with high-risk features (PSA >4 ng/mL with a doubling time of 20 ng/mL, nodal or metastatic relapse). Men were randomized to receive abiraterone acetate (1000 mg daily) plus prednisolone (5 mg) plus ADT or ADT alone. Just over half of the patients (52%) had metastatic disease, 20% had node-positive or node-indeterminate non-metastatic disease, and 28% had node-negative, non-metastatic disease; 95% had newly diagnosed disease. In a subgroup analysis, the OS benefit was seen in PCa patients with metastatic disease (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.49-0. but not patients with non-metastatic high-risk PCa (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.48-1.. 29 The impact of volume tumor burden was not reported.\nA recent, unplanned, post-hoc analysis of 759 evaluable patients with bone metastases in the STAMPEDE trial were reclassified using CHAARTED \"high-or low-volume\" criterion or LATITUDE \"high-or low-risk\" criterion. 31 Men with mCNPC had OS benefit with the addition of abiraterone acetate and prednisone to ADT irrespective of stratification for \"risk\" or \"volume.\" Using CHAARTED criteria, low-volume HR was 0.66 (95% CI 0.44-0. and high-volume HR was 0.54 (95% CI 0.41-0.; using the LATITUDE criteria, low-risk HR was 0.64 (95% CI 0.42-0. and high-risk HR was 0.60 (95% CI 0.46-0.. Although these results are intriguing, the retrospective nature of the reclassification of risk and tumor volume is a significant limitation and thus the results can only be considered hypothesis-generating.\n\n【13】 # Enzalutamide (160 mg/day) is a treatment option for patients with mCNPC/mCSPC regardless of volume of disease (Level of evidence 1, Strong recommendation).\n\n【14】 # Enzalutamide should not be used in combination (concurrent use) with docetaxel to treat patients mCNPC/mCSPC (Level of evidence 2, Strong recommendation).\n\n【15】 # Enzalutamide may be considered in patients with mCSPC previously treated with docetaxel chemotherapy (sequential use) (Level of evidence 1, Weak recommendation).\nEnzalutamide binds to the androgen receptor (AR) and inhibits the AR nuclear translocation and interaction with DNA. Suppression of the AR with enzalutamide was initially shown to improve survival in docetaxel-naive or -treated mCRPC. 32,33 Two recent studies assessed the role of enzalutamide for patients with mCNPC: ARCHES and ENZAMET. 34,35 The ARCHES trial randomized 1150 patients with mCNPC/ mCSPC to either enzalutamide (160 mg/day) plus ADT or placebo plus ADT. The primary endpoint was radiologic progression-free survival (rPFS), defined as the time from randomization to the first objective evidence of radiographic disease progression or death. The combination of enzalutamide plus ADT improved rPFS compared to placebo-ADT (HR 0.39, 95% CI 0.30-0.50, p=0.001; median not reached vs. 19.0 months). A recent final analysis showed improved OS in the enzalutamide treatment arm (HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.53-0.81, p<0.. 36 Prior docetaxel of up to six cycles was allowed, and 18%  patients received at least one dose of docetaxel prior to randomization; subgroup analysis showed that rPFS benefit was seen in both patients who were chemotherapy-treated and chemotherapy-naive. Benefit with enzalutamide in rPFS and OS was seen regardless of disease burden and timing of metastases (de novo vs. metachronous).\nENZAMET was an open-label clinical trial that randomized 1125 patients with mCNPC/mCSPC to receive ADT and enzalutamide daily (160 mg) or a non-steroidal antiandrogen (NSAA; bicalutamide, nilutamide, or flutamide) with a primary endpoint of OS. There was an OS benefit in the enzalutamide plus ADT arm compared to NSAA (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.52-0.86, p=0.. Kaplan-Meier estimates of OS at three years were 80% in the enzalutamide group and 72% in the NSAA arm. Unlike ARCHES, concurrent use of docetaxel was allowed and decision to treat with chemotherapy was at the discretion of the investigator. Use of chemotherapy was well-balanced between the two arms (45% of those receiving enzalutamide and 44% of those receiving a NSAA planned for early docetaxel use). In a subgroup analysis, the benefits of enzalutamide on OS appeared only in the group without planned early docetaxel use (concurrent docetaxel: HR 0.9, 95% CI 0.62-1.31; no concurrent docetaxel: HR 0.8, 95% CI 0.59-1.. Although the authors state that the study is underpowered and data is too immature to specifically answer whether combination docetaxel and enzalutamide is beneficial in mCNPC/mCSPC, these results show that this combination should not be used until further evidence is shown for its benefits.\n\n【16】 # Apalutamide (240 mg) is a treatment option for patients with mCNPC/mCSPC regardless of volume of disease (Level of evidence 1, Strong recommendation).\nApalutamide inhibits the AR by preventing its nuclear translocation and DNA binding. The first large, randomized clinical trial assessing apalutamide in mCNPC/mCSPC was the TITAN trial, which randomized 1052 patients with mCNPC/mCSPC (any) to receive apalutamide (240 mg once daily) plus ADT or ADT alone. As well, 10.7% received previous docetaxel therapy and 37.3% had low-volume disease. With a median of 40.0 months of followup, rPFS at 24 months was 68.2% in the apalutamide group and 47.5% in the placebo group (HR 0.48, 95% CI 0.39-0.60, p<0.. Benefit with apalutamide in rPFS was seen regardless of prior chemotherapy use or disease burden. Final analysis of OS showed apalutamide improved OS, reducing the risk of death by 35% (median OS for apalutamide not reached vs. 52.2 months in the placebo group; HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.53-0.79, p<0.. 37,38 Benefit with apalutamide in rPFS and OS was seen regardless of disease burden and timing of metastases (de novo vs. metachronous).\n\n【17】 # Triplet therapy\nIn patients who can safely tolerate docetaxel and in whom docetaxel is felt to be appropriate, triplet regimen should be considered as a treatment option.\n\n【18】 # Abiraterone acetate plus prednisone in combination with ADT and docetaxel is a treatment option for patients with mCNPC/mCSPC in high-volume disease (Level of evidence 1, Strong recommendation).\n\n【19】 # Abiraterone acetate plus prednisone in combination with docetaxel may be considered for patients with mCNPC/ mCSPC with low-volume disease (Level of evidence 3, Weak recommendation).\nRecent data from the PEACE-1 trial showed the benefits of the combination of ADT plus prednisone plus docetaxel and abiraterone acetate compared to docetaxel and ADT. 39 In a 2×2 factorial design, patients with de novo mCSPC (n= were randomly assigned to receive SOC (n=, SOC plus abiraterone and prednisone (n=, SOC plus radiotherapy (n=, or SOC plus abiraterone plus radiotherapy (n=. SOC treatments included ADT with or without docetaxel, and overall, 60% of participants received a median of six cycles of docetaxel.\nCompared with SOC (ADT plus docetaxel without abiraterone), the addition of abiraterone improved the median OS and reduced the relative risk of death from any cause by 25% (adjusted HR for OS 0.75, 95.1% CI 0.59-0.95, p=0.. Using CHAARTED study criteria, high-volume patients treated with abiraterone and prednisone with SOC (including docetaxel) compared to SOC alone reduced the relative risk of radiographic progression or death (adjusted HR 0.47, 99.9% CI 0.30-0.72, p<; OS was improved from 3.47 years with SOC without abiraterone to 5.14 years when abiraterone was added, corresponding to a 28% reduction in relative risk of death (adjusted HR 0.72, 95.1% CI 0.55-0.95, p=0.. In low-volume patients, the addition of abiraterone to SOC reduced the relative risk of radio-graphic progression or death (adjusted HR 0.58, 99.9% CI 0.29-1.15, p=0.; OS benefits were not found due to lack of maturity of the data (median OS not reached in either group). Importantly, although the addition of abiraterone to SOC increased the risk of hypertension (22% vs. 13%), the combination did not significantly increase grade 3 adverse events or other severe adverse events, such as neutropenia or fatigue.\n\n【20】 # Darolutamide in combination with ADT and docetaxel is a treatment option for patients with mCNPC/mCSPC regardless of volume of disease (Level of evidence 1, Strong recommendation).\nThe ARASENS trial randomized 1306 patients with mCSPC to receive docetaxel and ADT with (n= or without (n= darolutamide. 40 A significant improvement in OS was observed in those receiving darolutamide; the risk of death was 32.5% lower in the darolutamide group than in the placebo group (HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.57-0.80, p<0. and OS at four years was 62.7% (95% CI 58.7-66. in the darolutamide group and 50.4% (95% CI 46.3-54. in the placebo group. Although efficacy based on volume of disease was not defined, benefits of the addition of darolutamide with docetaxel was seen regardless of metastatic stage at initial diagnosis (M1: HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.59-0.85; M0: HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.35-1.. The addition of darolutamide to docetaxel did not increase adverse events, such as neutropenia or fatigue; the addition darolutamide slightly increased the rate of rash (16.6% vs. 13.5%) and hypertension (13.7% vs. 9.2%).\nThe ARASENS and PEACE-1 trials both show the benefits of adding an androgen receptor pathway inhibitor (ARPi) to docetaxel in CSPC. The studies show the benefits of triplet therapy (ADT, ARPi, and docetaxel) compared to ADT and docetaxel, but did not directly compare efficacy of triplet therapy to the combination therapy of ADT and ARPi. As such, these guidelines do not identify an \"optimal\" treatment option, and various triplet or doublet treatments are recommended.\nBoth studies show, in subgroup analyses, that there are limited patient characteristics that may influence the use of triplet vs. doublet therapy, as benefits in OS and rPFS were seen in a majority of prespecified patient factors. One patient characteristic, tumor volume based on CHARRTED study criteria, 7 was shown to be important in the PEACE-1 trial; in patients with low-volume disease, the addition of abiraterone to SOC reduced the relative risk of radiographic progression or death (adjusted HR 0.58, 99.9% CI 0.29-1.15, p=0. but OS benefits seen in patients with high-volume disease were not found, likely due to lack of maturity of the data (median OS not reached in either group). The influence of tumor volume was not reported in the ARASENS trials, but survival benefit Guideline: mCNPC & mCSPC was regardless of stage of diagnosis. 40 In summary, although volume of disease appears to differentiate survival advantage in the PEACE-1 trial, recommendations of triplet therapy regardless of volume of disease are made.\n\n【21】 # Prevention of osteoporosis\nAll patients with mCNPC/mCSPC treated with ADT should be assessed for fracture risk. All patients treated with ADT require vitamin D supplementation (800-1200 IU daily) and calcium supplementation (800-1000 mg total intake daily). Those at high risk of fractures should be treated (zoledronic acid 5 mg once a year, alendronate 70 mg weekly, denosumab 60 mg every six months) (Level of evidence 1, Strong recommendation).\n increasing. As such, these patients are at risk of significant bone loss, osteoporosis, and fragility fractures. Bone loss occurs quickly while on ADT, and within one year, patients can lose up to 10% of their bone mineral density (BMD).  Patients with mCNPC initiating ADT should have baseline BMD measured with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and fracture risk calculators, such as FRAX, should be used. 44 DXA should be performed at least every two years and more often in untreated patients at high risk or if there is a history of osteoporosis/osteopenia.\n be encouraged. If DXA scanning shows any evidence of osteopenia (T-score of -2. or osteoporosis (T-score of <-2., men should be started on a bone-targeted therapy to improve BMD and reduce the risk of fragility fractures (zoledronic acid 5 mg once a year, alendronate 70 mg weekly, denosumab 60 mg every six months). 42,43,45 These doses are much lower than those needed to prevent skeletal-related events (SREs) in patients with mCRPC and, therefore, are associated with significantly reduced side effects; incidences of clinically significant hypocalcemia and osteonecrosis of the jaw are rare using denosumab or zoledronic acid at these lower doses. 46,47 \n\n【22】 # Treatment of oligo-metastatic disease\nThere is evolving evidence of the role of radiation in asymptomatic distant metastases, especially in low-burden \"oligometastatic\" disease. Currently, there is limited data with which to provide general recommendations; however, a mul-tidisciplinary approach would provide the best opportunity to determine optimal management on a case-by-case basis and to consider patient enrollment in ongoing clinical trials.\n\n【23】 # Multidisciplinary consultation\nPatients with mCNPC/mCSPC should be assessed in a multidisciplinary manner whenever possible (Level of evidence 3, Strong recommendation).\nTiming of treatment initiation and selecting the optimal systemic therapy from a multitude of options requires careful consideration of several different clinical factors, such as eligibility of chemotherapy, side effect profile of medications, disease burden, symptoms, and presence of visceral metastases. Since treatment may require a multifaceted approach, including upfront docetaxel-based regimes, early assessment of eligibility of chemotherapy is essential. As well, combined opinions from urology, medical oncology, and radiation oncology may be required to provide optimal care of patients with mCNPC/mCSPC. Additionally, as mCNPC/mCSPC continues to be an incurable disease, strong consideration should be given to inclusion of patients in clinical trials.\n\n【24】 # Conclusions\nThe last few years have seen a significant growth of lifeextending therapies for PCa patients that has changed the landscape of treatment for mCNPC/mCSPC. All patients with mCNPC/mCSPC, regardless of disease volume and whether metastases were de novo or metachronous, should be offered treatment-intensifying systemic therapy in addition to ADT. For those with low-risk/low-volume disease, radiation therapy to the prostate should be strongly considered in addition to systemic therapy.\nA summary on the recommended treatment for mCNPC/ mCSPC is shown in \n\n【25】 # Low-risk/volume disease\nHigh-risk/volume disease ADT (SOC) \nCompeting interests: Dr. So has been an advisory board member for AbbVie, Astellas, Bayer, Janssen, Merck, and TerSera.

The document needs to be reviewed and applied, based on the specific needs of the organization or practice setting/environment, as well as the needs and wishes of the client G. This guideline should be applied as a tool or template that is intended to enhance decision making in the provision of individualized care. In addition, the guideline provides an overview of appropriate structures and supports necessary for the provision of the best possible evidence-based care.\nNurses, other health-care professionals and administrators who lead and facilitate practice changes will find this document invaluable for the development of policies, procedures, protocols, educational programs and assessments, interventions and documentation tools. Nurses providing direct care will benefit from reviewing the recommendations, the evidence G in support of the recommendations and the process that was used to develop this edition of the guideline. However, it is highly recommended that practice settings/environments adapt these guidelines in formats that would be user-friendly for daily use. This guideline has some suggested formats for local adaptation and tailoring.\nOrganizations adopting the guideline are advised to carry out the following processes: a) Assess current nursing and health-care practices using the recommendations in the guideline. b) Identify recommendations that will address needs or gaps in services. c) Develop a plan to implement the recommendations systematically using associated tools and resources, with particular attention to the RNAO Implementation Toolkit (2012b).\nThe Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario is interested in hearing how you have implemented this guideline. Please contact us to share your story. Implementation resources are available through the RNAO website  to assist individuals and organizations to implement best practice guidelines.\nThroughout this document, terms marked with the superscript symbol G ( G can be found in the Glossary of Terms A).\n\n【3】 # BAC K G R O U N D\nAssessment and Management of Foot Ulcers for People with Diabetes, Second Edition\n\n【4】 # Purpose and Scope\nBest practice guidelines are systematically developed statements designed to assist nurses and clients in decision making about appropriate health care (Field & Lohr, . This guideline has been developed to address the question of how to assess and manage people with established diagnosis of diabetic foot ulcer(s) G. It provides evidencebased recommendations to all nurses and the interprofessional team G who provide care in all health-care settings to people (>15 years of age) with type 1 and/or type 2 diabetes and who have established diabetic foot ulcers.\nCaring for people with diabetic foot ulcers is an interprofessional endeavour. Effective care depends on a coordinated interprofessional approach incorporating ongoing communication between health-care professionals and people with diabetic foot ulcers. It is, however, acknowledged that personal preferences and unique needs as well as the personal and environmental resources available to each client must always be considered in the delivery of care. The intent of this document is to assist all nurses and the interprofessional team to focus on evidence-based strategies, within the context of the health-care professional-client relationship. It is further acknowledged that individual competencies of nurses may vary among nurses and across categories of nursing professionals. These competencies are based on knowledge, skills, attitudes and judgment enhanced over time by experience and education. It is expected that individual nurses will perform only those aspects of care for which they have received appropriate education and experience. All nurses should seek consultation in instances where the client's care needs surpass the individual nurse's ability to act independently.\n Appendices B and C for the guideline development process and process for systematic review G /search of the literature.\n\n【5】 # BAC K G R O U N D\nAssessment and Management of Foot Ulcers for People with Diabetes, Second Edition\n\n【6】 # Summary of Recommendations\nThis guideline is a new edition of, and replaces, the 2005 publication of the RNAO Nursing Best Practice Guideline: Assessment and Management of Foot Ulcers for People with Diabetes. Recommendations are marked as ✔, ✚, or NEW according to the following:\n✔ No change was made to the recommendation as a result of the systematic review evidence.\n✚ The recommendation and/or supporting evidence were updated as a result of the systematic review evidence.\nNEW A new recommendation was developed as a result of the systematic review evidence.\n\n【7】 # PRACTICE RECOMMENDATIONS G\n\n【8】 # LEVEL OF EVIDENCE\nAssessment 1.0 Obtain a comprehensive health history and perform physical examination of affected limb(s).\n\n【9】 # Ib -IV\n\n【10】 # Stakeholder Acknowledgement\nStakeholders G representing diverse perspectives were solicited for their feedback, and the Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario wishes to acknowledge the following individuals for their contribution in reviewing this Nursing Best Practice Guideline.\n\n【11】 # BAC K G R O U N D\nAssessment and Management of Foot Ulcers for People with Diabetes, Second Edition\n\n【12】 # Background Context\nDiabetes mellitus is a serious and complex life-long condition affecting 8.3% of the world's population and 2.7 million Canadians (Canadian Diabetes Association (CDA), 2010; International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot (IWGDF), 2011; Lipscomb & Hux, . The prevalence of diabetes has increased 70% since the 1998 publication of the CDA clinical practice guidelines G and the rate continues to increase across all age groups. Between 1995 and 2005, the prevalence of diabetes in Ontario increased steadily by an average of 6.2% per year (Lipscomb & Hux, . The rate of diabetes is increasing the greatest among Aboriginal Canadians, who have a three to five times higher rate of diabetes than the general population (Doucet & Beatty, . Diabetes seriously burdens individuals, their families and society. With the increasing prevalence of diabetes in Canada, the annual economic cost attributo the condition is estimated to rise from $5.2 billion in 1998 to $16.9 billion by 2020 (Lau, .\n known as noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), accounts for 90% of those diagnosed with diabetes and results from a combination of insufficient insulin production and resistance of the body's cells to the actions of insulin (CDA, .\nControl of blood glucose levels is paramount to minimizing complications related to diabetes (Diabetes Control and Complication Trial (DCCT) Research Group, 1993; United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) Group 33, . This is achieved through lowering of serum glucose levels using oral hypoglycemic agents, subcutaneous injections of insulin, dietary restriction and regular exercise. Other factors contributing to delayed onset of complications include control of hypertension, hyperlipidemia and hyperinsulinemia. Unfortunately, these treatments may not completely control the progression of diabetes-related changes, such as neuropathy (Canadian Diabetes Association (CDA) Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) Expert Committee, .\n known as peripheral vascular disease, is a circulatory problem in which narrowed arteries reduce blood flow to the lower limbs. This can result in poor oxygen circulation and medication delivery thereby impacting the ability to heal and increasing the risk for ulceration. Neuropathy occurs when the nerves of the peripheral nervous system are damaged (by diabetes) and can result in loss of sensation, skin changes, deformities and limited joint mobility of the foot. When combined with other factors, such as inadequate self care, poor glucose control, improper footwear, obesity and lack of timely resources, these neuropathic changes may lead to foot ulceration.\nWhile the majority of ulcers eventually heal, approximately one third may result in some form of amputation (IWGDF, . Moreover, there is a possibility of infection occurring in any foot ulcer in a person with diabetes. Diabetic foot infections require medical attention ranging from minor (e.g., debridement, antibiotics) to major (resection, amputation) intervention .\n\n【13】 # BAC K G R O U N D\nAssessment and Management of Foot Ulcers for People with Diabetes, Second Edition Ulcers and amputations result in enormous societal costs, including lost wages, job loss, prolonged hospitalization, lengthy rehabilitation and an increased need for home care and social services. Given the data on the burden of illness and the significant long-term health impact, care of persons with diabetic foot ulcers demands a systematic, team approach from health-care professionals (IWGDF, .\nThe panel recognizes the complexity of the treatment of persons with diabetic foot ulcers and acknowledges the realities of practice settings that may influence resources available to identify the highest quality evidence to direct care.\nTo this end, the recommendations serve as an evidence-based guide for nurses and other health-care professionals to identify and assess people in high-risk groups who would benefit from specialized wound care. Interprofessional health-care teams should work closely with clients and their families to address the complex lifestyle, self care and multiple treatment demands of people with diabetes diagnosed with diabetic foot ulcer(s). It is acknowledged that this level of care is not yet fully accessible to or accessed by all people with diabetes. Moreover, few people with foot ulcerations receive optimal wound management (Boulton, Kirsner, & Vileikyte, . Nurses can facilitate and positively influence wound healing outcomes by promoting, collaborating and participating in interprofessional health-care teams that follow best practice guidelines as presented in this document.  The management of persons with foot ulcers is complex. According to Weir , diabetic foot ulcers should be regarded a medical emergency. Principles of clinical management of the person with diabetic foot ulcers involve assessing for: vascular supply (V); infection (I); structural or bony deformities, foot wear and sensation to determine pressure related issues (P); and, sharp debridement of non-viable tissue (s). These principles are often termed by their acronym, VIPs (Inlow, Orsted, & Sibbald, .\nThe Canadian Association of Wound Care Wound Bed Preparation framework is helpful in outlining the key clinical symptoms and issues related to diabetic foot ulcers and approaches to management utilizing the above principles of VIPs . This framework is presented in   Obtain a comprehensive health history and perform physical examination of affected limb(s).\n\n【14】 # Level of Evidence = Ib -IV\n\n【15】 # Discussion of Evidence:\nA comprehensive health history is required for all clients who present with diabetic foot ulceration. This health history must include a history of presenting illness, past medical history, glycemic control, nutritional status, allergies, medications, family history and psychological well-being.\n\n【16】 # History of Presenting Illness (Level of Evidence = IV)\nAssessment of the person with a diabetic foot ulcer requires a detailed history of the presenting illness, including:  Initiating event;  Duration of ulceration;  Treatments undertaken; and  Outcome of the treatments.\n\n【17】 # Past Medical History (Level of Evidence = III)\nA history of diabetic foot ulcers and several diabetes-related complications are associated with lower limb amputations. Therefore, a thorough past medical history is important to identify individuals at high risk for amputation, and it should inclu\nPeople with diabetic foot ulcers should be identified as high risk for amputation (Australian Centre for Diabetes Strategies (ACDS), 2001; Falanga & Sabolinski, 2000;IWGDF, .\n D for risk factors for amputation.\nAssessment and Management of Foot Ulcers for People with Diabetes, Second Edition\n\n【18】 # A. Co-morbidities and Complications Associated with Diabetes\nThere are multiple co-morbidities and complications associated with diabetes (CDA CPG Expert Committee, .\nThe following discussion will focus on co-morbidities of renal impairment, hypertension and retinopathy. Early identification of co-morbidities and complications allows the health-care professional to initiate appropriate referrals and develop a comprehensive interprofessional plan of care.\n\n【19】 # Renal Impairment\nRenal impairment is a prevalent microvascular complication. Fifty percent of people with diabetes have renal impairment (CDA CPG Expert Committee, . In a retrospective observational study, Eggers, Gohdes and Pugh  identified that amputation rates for people with diabetes and end-stage renal disease increased 10-fold compared to people with diabetes alone. Furthermore, the post-amputation survival rate for clients with diabetes and end-stage renal disease was approximately 33% .\nThe majority of people with diabetes will develop hypertension, a trearisk factor (CDA CPG Expert Committee, . Adler and colleagues  identified that elevated blood pressure is strongly linked to macrovascular (e.g., peripheral vascular disease) and microvascular (e.g., retinopathy and nephropathy) complications. Peripheral vascular disease places individuals at a significantly increased risk for amputation (Royal Melbourne Hospital, . Improved control of hypertension results in clinically significant reductions in microvascular and macrovascular complications and diabetes-related death (CDA CPG Expert Committee, .\n suggests that the presence of retinopathy increases a client's risk for amputation.\n\n【20】 # B. Previous Ulcers\nA history of previous ulcers is a strong predictor of future ulcers. Up to 34% of people develop another ulcer within 1 year after healing from the previous ulcer. The 5-year rate of re-ulceration has been shown to be 70%. While two thirds of ulcers heal, one third may result in some form of amputation (IWGDF, .\n\n【21】 # C. Smoking\n be a risk factor for retinopathy in type 1 diabetes. Smoking cessation reduces these risks and may optimize conditions for wound healing (SIGN, .\nAssessment and Management of Foot Ulcers for People with Diabetes, Second Edition\n\n【22】 # Glycemic Control (Level of Evidence = Ib)\nImproved glycemic control reduces complications and optimizes wound healing (Marston & Dermagraft Diabetic Foot Ulcer Study Group, . In a cohort study by Moss, Klein and Klein , elevated blood glucose levels were highly correlated with complications of diabetes. In a randomized controlled trial, pharmacological control of blood glucose was shown to reduce diabetes-related complications in overweight clients with type 2 diabetes (UKPDS, .\nSimilarly, a study examining glycemic control and microvascular complications in Japanese people with type 2 diabetes concluded that intensive glycemic control may delay onset and progression of diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy .\nFrom a wound healing perspective, a secondary analysis of data from a prospective, randomized controlled trial by Marston and Dermagraft Diabetic Foot Ulcer Study Group  found that people treated with a human fibroblast-derived dermal substitute had better wound healing rates when A1c levels were controlled or reduced over a 12-week period. Similarly, in a retrospective cohort study by Markuson , patients with higher A1c levels did experience wound healing, but over a significantly longer period than those with lower A1c.\nThe Canadian Diabetes Association (CDA) Clinical Practice Guidelines (CDA CPG Expert Committee,  recommends the following targets for glycemic control for most people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes:  A1c ≤ 7.0% to reduce the risk of microvascular and macrovascular complications;  Fasting plasma glucose of 4.0 to 7.0 mmol/L; and  2-hour postprandial plasma glucose targets of 5.0 to l0.0 mmol/L (5.0 to 8.0 mmol/L if A1c targets not being met).\n\n【23】 # Nutritional Status (Level of Evidence = IV)\nThe overall nutritional health of a person with diabetes will have an effect on wound healing. Macronutrients and micronutrients play an important role in the different stages of wound healing. A person with diabetes should ensure adequate intake of calories, protein, fat, fluids, vitamins and minerals to achieve positive outcomes. A nutritional assessment by a registered dietician is indicated if nutritional deficits are identified.\n\n【24】 # Allergies (Level of Evidence = IV)\nA comprehensive health history should include a record of any allergies. Allergies pertinent to foot ulcers may consist of medication allergies and sensitivities to dressing adhesives and debridement materials. Being aware of allergies allows the health-care professional to make appropriate choices with regards to medications for treatment of infections, wound dressings and solutions used for debridement.\n\n【25】 # Medications (Level of Evidence = IV)\nA record of current medications should be included as part of the health history. Medication records provide healthcare professionals with the necessary information for proper pharmacological diabetes management, such as drug contraindications, potential drug interactions and identification of medications that may impair wound healing.\n\n【26】 # Family History (Level of Evidence = III)\nIt is important that people with diabetes are asked about their family health history. Family health history reflects inherited genetic susceptibility and shared environment, behaviours and habits (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, . People with a family history for certain diseases (e.g., heart disease, diabetes and osteoporosis) are more likely to develop those diseases themselves (Bennett, .\n\n【27】 # Psychological Well Being (Level of Evidence = IV)\nIt is important to determine the psychological well being of individuals with diabetes as it can impact on their ability to manage their condition. Clinical depression, anxiety and eating disorders are known factors associated with poor control of type 1 diabetes (SIGN, . More specifically, depression, affecting approximately 15% of people with diabetes, is associated with, but not limited to, poor self-care behaviours and decreased quality of life (CDA, 2012;CDA CPG Expert Committee, 2008;SIGN, . Therefore, health professionals should explore psychological well being as part of a comprehensive health history as it may impede self-management strategies to prevent and manage diabetic foot ulcers.\n\n【28】 # RECOMMENDATION 1.1:\nIdentify the location and classification of foot ulcer(s) and measure length, width and depth of wound bed.\n\n【29】 # Level of Evidence = Ia -IV\n\n【30】 # Discussion of Evidence:\n\n【31】 # Identification of Ulcer Location (Level of Evidence = III)\nThe location of the foot ulcer is important to identify as this information may have an impact on care planning and the use of appropriate pressure redistribution devices. According to a prospective observational study by Reiber , the plantar region of the toes, forefoot and midfoot were the most frequent sites of ulceration followed by the dorsal region of the toes and heels.\n\n【32】 # Classification (Level of Evidence = 1a)\nDiabetic foot ulcer stratification systems are essential tools for predicting a client's risk of developing a foot ulcer (Monteiro-Soares, Boyko, Rebeiro, Rebeiro, & Dinis-Rebeiro, . In addition, using a stratification system facilitates effective communication between health-care professionals regarding the client's risk for amputation, and can facilitate data collection related to disease severity.\nAssessment and Management of Foot Ulcers for People with Diabetes, Second Edition\nThe following five stratification systems were identified by a systematic review:\n- University of Texas . The authors concluded that while classification of foot ulcers in itself was important, the best system to use for specific health-care settings could not be determined.\n\n【33】 # Measuring the Length and Width (Level of Evidence = Ia)\nStandardizing the procedure for measurement of diabetic foot ulcers is crucial to evaluate whether the wound is moving towards desired outcomes. Consistent and accurate measurements of length and width aid in reliable tracking of wound closure progress. Wound measurements should be completed using a consistent method such as tracings (Krasner & Sibbald, . A systematic review evaluating treatments for diabetic foot ulcers classified wounds as healing when the wound length and width decreased (Margolis, Kantor, & Berlin, . Furthermore, a prospective trial conducted by Sheehan, Jones, Caselli, Giurini and Veves  demonstrated that a 50% reduction in wound surface area (length and width) at 4 weeks is a good predictor of complete wound healing at 12 weeks.\n\n【34】 # Measuring the Depth (Level of Evidence = IV)\n be determined in this manner by probing a space between the surrounding skin and wound bed. The RNAO expert panel recommends using the \"clock\" system to document the location of tunneling or undermining (e.g., area of the tunneling or undermining closest to the head is the 12 o'clock position).\nAssessment and Management of Foot Ulcers for People with Diabetes, Second Edition\n\n【35】 # RECOMMENDATION 1.2:\nAssess bed of foot ulcer(s) for exudate, odour, condition of peri-ulcer skin and pain.\n\n【36】 # Level of Evidence = IV\n\n【37】 # Discussion of Evidence:\n\n【38】 # Exudate (Level of Evidence = IV)\nWound exudate characteristics (e.g., amount and type of drainage) provide important information about the status of the wound. The RNAO expert panel recommends rating the amount of exudate observed using the following terms:\n\n【39】 # Odour (Level of Evidence = IV)\nAll wounds, especially those treated with moisture retentive dressings, can emit an odour, and it is important to assess the foot ulcer bed for the characteristics of this odour. A change in odour may be indicative of an alteration in bacterial balance. A healthy wound has a faint but not unpleasant odour; infections often result in a distinctive and slightly unpleasant odour (Butalia, Palda, Sargeant, Detsky, & Mourad, 2008;Cutting & Harding, . Necrotic wounds tend to have more offensive odours than clean wounds. Wounds infected with anaerobes, suggestive of gangrene, tend to produce a distinct acrid or putrid odour.\n\n【40】 # Condition of Peri-Ulcer Skin (Level of Evidence = IV)\nThe condition of the peri-ulcer skin provides important information about the status of the wound and can influence choice of intervention and treatment. The RNAO expert panel recommends a surrounding skin assessment that includes an evaluation of:\n indicate infection in the wound (Sibbald, Goodman, Woo, Krasner, & Smart, .  Callus G formation: Callus formation is indicative of ongoing pressure to the affected area. Debridement of callus may be indicated to facilitate accurate assessment; and  Induration and edema: Induration (an abnormal firmness of the tissue) and edema (swelling) are indicative of infection. They are assessed by gently pressing the skin within 4 cm of the wound. Firmness may be observed.\n\n【41】 # Pain (Level of Evidence = III)\n indicate active charcot arthropathy G  H for a description).\nCharcot arthropathy can be difficult to distinguish from wound infection or cellulitis G. Left untreated, charcot arthopathy may lead to serious foot structure damage and injury. X-rays should be done to differentiate an active charcot foot from infection.\nPersons with diabetes may suffer from neuropathic foot pain. This pain is often described as burning and stabbing in nature, and its presence is generally independent of foot position or movements. Neuropathic pain can be difficult to manage and requires careful assessment and monitoring.\nAs demonstrated in , diabetic neuropathy increases the risk of foot ulceration and subsequent amputation (Frykberg, . In the presence of diabetic neuropathy and amputation, clients may suffer from phantom limb pain in the absent leg. Referral to physiotherapy for pain relieving modalities such as transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation may be necessary to treat both neuropathic and phantom limb pain (CDA CPG Expert Committee, .\nAssessment and Management of Foot Ulcers for People with Diabetes, Second Edition\n\n【42】 # RECOMMENDATION 1.3:\nAssess affected limb(s) for vascular supply and facilitate appropriate diagnostic testing, as indicated.\n\n【43】 # Level of Evidence = III -IV\n\n【44】 # Discussion of Evidence:\n I for further detail about these specialized diagnostic tests.\n known as peripheral vascular disease, is a narrowing of the peripheral arteries resulting in insufficient vascular supply to the lower extremities. PAD can prolong wound healing and increase the risk of amputation . In the younger client population, PAD often presents bilaterally. Therefore, adequate blood flow to the affected extremities is essential to support wound healing . Positive findings should be discussed with a vascular surgeon in order to determine potential for intervention.\nBilateral lower extremity assessment should include, at minimum, the assessment of:\n Intermittent claudication;  Peripheral pedal pulses; and  Colour.\n\n【45】 # Intermittent Claudication (Level of Evidence = III)\nOne of the first presenting symptoms of vascular insufficiency is intermittent claudication, or calf pain. A history of intermittent lower limb claudication combined with non-palpable pedal pulses in both feet increases the probability of vascular insufficiency in clients with diabetes .\n\n【46】 # Peripheral Pedal Pulses (Level of Evidence = IV)\nPalpating for the presence of a plantar pulse, such as the dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial, is essential during assessment. The presence of peripheral pulses is represented by a minimum systolic pressure of 80 mmHg and may suggest adequate vascular supply to support wound healing (Lavery & Gazewood, . The National Evidence Based Guidelines for the Management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus states that the absence of peripheral pulses has prognostic significance for future amputation in people with or without foot ulceration (ACDS, .\nSome regions of the foot with palpable pulses, however, may not be well-perfused. According to the angiosome model, the foot is delineated into five angiosomes, each consisting of skin, subcutaneaous tissue, fascia, muscle and bone, fed by a source artery. The presence of a peripheral pulse may not necessarily indicate that all of the components within a particular angiosome are well-perfused. Although a foot pulse might be palpable, the foot ulcer might be situated in a different angiosome .\n\n【47】 # Colour (Level of Evidence = IV)\nThe colour of the foot should be assessed for rubor on dependency, pallor on elevation, mottling and dry gangrene, all of which are signs of ischemia (Bowker & Pfeifer, .

Infection is a destructive process that occurs when bacteria in a wound overcomes the natural defenses of the host's immune system. The likelihood of a wound becoming infected is related to the type of micro-organism and the microbial load. However, equally important factors to consider are the characteristics of the wound (location, classification, length, width and depth), level of blood perfusion and ability of the host to resist infection.\nWhile emphasis is frequently placed on microbial load, the host's resistance is often the critical factor in determining whether infection will develop. Diabetes increases susceptibility to infection. People with diabetes may not be able to mount an effective inflammatory response due to impaired immunodefenses, decreased peripheral circulation and decreased metabolic control (Armstrong, Lavery, Sariaya, & Ashry, 1996;Eneroth, Apelqvist, & Stenstrom, . Increased occurrence of co-morbidities may place older people with diabetes at higher risk for infection than younger people with the disease as the severity of the infection may be masked by the co-morbidities. Use of an assessment tool, such as the Diabetic Foot Infection (DFI) scoring system, validated by Lipsky, Polis, Lantz, Norquist and Abramson , may aid in predicting foot ulcer healing outcomes.\n J for wound swabbing technique.\nAssessment and Management of Foot Ulcers for People with Diabetes, Second Edition The RNAO expert panel recommends using clinical assessment with diagnostic testing in the assessment of foot ulcer infection.\n\n【50】 # Signs and Symptoms of Infection\nThe presence of infection should be assessed based on the presentation of two or more of the following signs and symptoms of inflammation or purulence The signs and symptoms of non-limb-threatening or superficial infection, and limb-threatening or deep wound and systemic infection G are summarized in \nAssessment and Management of Foot Ulcers for People with Diabetes, Second Edition   Identifying infection in a chronic wound can be a challenge as the clinical assessment for infection in chronic wounds differs from acute wounds.  identified the following signs and symptoms of soft tissue infection in a cross-sectional study of 64 subjects with diabetic foot ulcers:\n Increased pain;  Wound breakdown;  Friable granulation tissue G ; and  Foul odour.\nDeep foot infections have been identified as the immediate cause of 25 to 51% of amputations in persons with diabetes (Tennvall, Apelqvist, & Eneroth, . Deep infections often present with erythema and warmth extending two centimeters or more beyond the wound margin (Woo & Sibbald, . This increased inflammatory response may be painful and cause the wound to increase in size or lead to satellite areas of tissue breakdown, known as adjacent ulceration (Woo & Sibbald, .\n indicative of osteomyelitis .\nSigns of deep wound and systemic signs of infection are potentially limb and/or life threatening. These clinical signs and symptoms require urgent medical attention.\n\n【51】 # Diagnostic Testing of Infection\nThe timely diagnosis and treatment of infection is vital to the healing of diabetic foot ulcers. Diagnostic tests may be performed in conjunction with the clinical assessment when infection is suspected.\nLipsky  recommend that persons with new diabetic foot infections have plain radiographs to identify bony abnormalities such as bone deformity or destruction, foreign bodies or soft tissue gas. An abnormal plain radiograph finding can be helpful in the diagnosis of osteomyelitis .\nMagnetic resonance imaging  is recommended for clients who require additional imaging, especially if soft tissue abscess G or osteomyelitis is suspected . If MRI is unavailable or contraindicated, a labeled white blood cell scan is the best alternative . It is important to note that accessibility to and interpretation of these tests may be limited to specific geographic locations and medical specialists.\nAssessment and Management of Foot Ulcers for People with Diabetes, Second Edition RECOMMENDATION 1.5:\nAssess affected limb(s) for sensory, autonomic and motor changes.\n\n【52】 # Level of Evidence = IIa\nDiscussion of Evidence:\nThe presence of peripheral neuropathy, or nerve damage, is determined by assessing for specific changes in sensory, autonomic and motor function. Identifying peripheral neuropathy is particularly important, as it will enable the health-care professional to identify associated potential risk factors for ulcer development. In a case-controlled study, Lavery  noted that clients with peripheral neuropathy and no other risk factors were 1.7 times more likely to develop foot ulceration.  illustrates the associated pathophysiological involvement, assessment considerations, and clinical indications specific to each of the three components of peripheral neuropathy.

People with foot ulcers should be assessed regularly for potential causes of such trauma and be provided with interventions to reduce trauma and ulcer risk .\n\n【55】 # Elevated Foot Pressure (Level of Evidence = IIb)\nElevated plantar pressure is a significant risk factor for foot complications (Lavery, Armstrong, Wunderlich, Tredwell, & Boulton, . The plantar surface of the forefoot is the most common location for foot ulcer development (CDA CPG Expert Committee, 2008;IWGDF, . People with severe neuropathy may exhibit increased forefoot-to-rearfoot plantar pressure ratios, suggesting an imbalance in pressure distribution, which may predispose them to foot ulceration.\n identified a significant association between high plantar pressure (65 N/cm 2 and presence of foot ulceration.\nPressure over bony prominences can lead to callus formation and predispose the skin to break down .\n important to ensure that dressings and offloading devices are used effectively, and that they are not contributing to increased pressure either around the ulcer or on other parts of the foot and leg.\n\n【56】 # Structural Deformities (Level of Evidence = III)\nPhysical examination of a person with diabetes should include an assessment for foot deformities (IWGDF, 2011;Royal Melbourne Hospital, . Foot deformities include hammer toe, claw toe, hallux deformity G pes planus, pes cavus and charcot arthropathy. These structural foot deformities alter the gait or mechanics of walking, and can result in abnormal forces on the foot, poor shock absorption, and shearing and stress to soft tissues (RNAO, 2007;Shaw & Boulton, . Furthermore, the risk for elevated plantar pressure is directly associated with the number of foot deformities .\n H for descriptions of each type of foot deformity.\nAny deformity of the foot should be referred to a specialist (podiatrist/chiropodist) for further evaluation.\nAssessment and Management of Foot Ulcers for People with Diabetes, Second Edition\n\n【57】 # Ability to Exercise (Level of Evidence = IV)\nExercise may help people with diabetes to achieve a variety of health goals, including improved glycemic control (CDA CPG Expert Committee, 2008;SIGN, . Limited joint mobility as a result of peri-articular limitations (e.g., muscle, tendon, joint capsule, ligament and skin) can be effectively treated with exercise-based interventions, including stretching and strength training .\nIt is important to note that people with diabetes-associated complications, including ulceration, should be carefully assessed and supervised when undertaking an exercise program.

Abnormal gait patterns that may be observed in a person with diabetes inclu\nReferral to a physical therapist may be indicated if gait abnormalities are noted.\n\n【59】 # Ill-fitting Footwear and Offloading Devices (Level of Evidence = Ia)\nClients should be assessed for knowledge and understanding of the importance of proper footwear and offloading device use to reduce plantar pressures. Education regarding proper fit and use of footwear and devices should be provided if knowledge gaps or learning needs are identified.\nIn a large prospective study, Abbott and colleagues  found that 55% of ulcerations assessed were attributed to pressure from footwear. Foot ulceration has been associated with constant or repetitive pressure from tight shoes over bony prominences on the dorsum of the lesser toes, at the medial aspect of the first metatarsal head G and the lateral aspect of the fifth metatarsal .\nIt is imperative that people with diabetic foot ulcers see a foot-or health-care specialist regularly for the assessment of their feet, footwear and other devices associated with ambulation .\n L for suggestions in assessing and selecting shoes and socks.\n\n【60】 # Offloading Devices\nOffloading devices, such as foot orthoses, aid in reducing plantar pressure in the diabetic foot. Foot orthoses are custom-made shoe inserts that serve to correct or relieve misalignment and/or pressure areas of the foot. A systematic review by Spencer  found that in-shoe custom orthoses were effective at relieving foot pressure and resolving calluses in people with diabetes.\n M for selection of offloading devices.\n\n【61】 # RECOMMENDATION 1.7:\nDocument characteristics of foot ulcer(s) after each assessment including location, classification and any abnormal findings.\n\n【62】 # Level of Evidence = IV\n\n【63】 # Discussion of Evidence:\nDocumentation is used to monitor a client's progress and communicate with other health-care providers (College of Nurses of Ontario (CNO), 2009a). Good record-keeping using common language and objective descriptors such as wound measurements and ulcer grading can increase clarity and improve outcomes. Careful monitoring of wound healing through consistent and thorough documentation is as important as initial assessment and treatment in influencing healing outcomes (Krasner, .\n N for an example of an assessment tool that may be used by an interprofessional team.\nAssessment and Management of Foot Ulcers for People with Diabetes, Second Edition\n\n【64】 # PLANNING RECOMMENDATION 2.0:\nDetermine the potential of the foot ulcer(s) to heal and ensure interventions to optimize healing have been explored.\n\n【65】 # Level of Evidence = IV\n\n【66】 # Discussion of Evidence:\nThe healing potential of a wound must be taken into consideration when developing a plan of care. Factors affecting the healing potential of a diabetic foot ulcer may be grouped into three categories: local, host and environment. The RNAO expert panel has summarized these factors in   (Falanga, 2005;)\nAssessment and Management of Foot Ulcers for People with Diabetes, Second Edition Moist wound care is not recommended in wounds where complete healing is not the goal. Use a dry dressing to keep the wound bed dry.\nIf infection is present and the client cannot fight infection, the moist wound will become a breeding ground for infection. Using a topical, cost-effective antiseptic G such as povidone iodine should be considered when the risk of infection outweighs the healing potential.\n\n【67】 # RECOMMENDATION 2.1:\nDevelop a plan of care incorporating goals mutually agreed upon by the client and health-care professionals to manage diabetic foot ulcer(s).\n\n【68】 # Level of Evidence = IV\n\n【69】 # Discussion of Evidence:\nProper goal-setting enables the team to closely monitor the effectiveness of interventions, continuing those that are successful and discontinuing those that are unsuccessful.\nIdeally, the primary goal in the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers is to obtain wound closure as expeditiously as possible. The resolution of foot ulcers and decreasing the rate of re-occurrence can lower the probability of lower extremity amputation for clients with diabetes. However, it should not be expected that all diabetic foot ulcers will have wound closure as a primary outcome. Wounds that are unlikely to heal should have alternative goals such as:\n Wound stabilization;  Reduced pain;  Reduced bacterial load; and  Decreased dressing changes.\n motivate the client, ensure the team is working toward a common end and ensure important actions are not overlooked. Frequent re-evaluation of goals and the overall plan of care is essential as the circumstances affecting wound care may change .\n include strategies to prevent deconditioning, which has many detrimental side effects, including psychosocial dysfunction.\nIn a client-centred model of care, diabetic foot ulcers are managed through a holistic approach where interprofessional team members synchronize activities to ensure the client receives the appropriate treatment from experts of each discipline (Schoen, Balchin & Thompson, . Team members should advocate, collaborate and facilitate the process of goal-directed care to manage foot ulcers for people with diabetes. Fragmentation of care may lead to conflicting advice for the client, wasted time and unnecessary effort, and subsequent protracted wound healing.\nAssessment and Management of Foot Ulcers for People with Diabetes, Second Edition\n\n【70】 # RECOMMENDATION 2.2:\nCollaborate with the client/family and interprofessional team to explore other treatment options if healing has not occurred at the expected rate.\n\n【71】 # Level of Evidence = IV\nDiscussion of Evidence:\nDiabetic foot ulcers that have not healed at the expected rate, where potential causative factors have been addressed, may require the use of alternative treatment modalities, such as biological agents, adjunctive therapies or surgery.\n O for specific treatment options. These treatment methods often involve the cooperation and coordination of various members of the interprofessional team. Nurses should collaborate with the client and interprofessional team to explore treatment options, determine the best course of action for treatment and implement a revised plan of care.\n\n【72】 # RECOMMENDATION 2.3:\nCollaborate with client/family and the interprofessional team to establish mutually agreed upon goals to improve quality of life if factors affecting poor healing have been addressed and complete wound closure is unlikely.\n\n【73】 # Level of Evidence = IV\n\n【74】 # Discussion of Evidence:\nThe RNAO expert panel has summarized various factors that can contribute to poor healing of chronic wounds: If factors affecting poor healing of chronic wounds have been addressed and complete wound closure is unlikely, the client and the health-care team should mutually agree upon a plan of care to improve the quality of life for the client (Enoch & Price, . To improve quality of life, the significance of managing exudate, controlling infection, relieving pain and minimizing odour in a non-healing wound must be established and accepted as legitimate goals by the client and the health-care team (Enoch & Price, .\nMajor or minor amputation may be the most reasonable intervention for clients with complex or life-threatening situations. However, amputation should be a mutual decision between the client and the health-care team.\nAssessment and Management of Foot Ulcers for People with Diabetes, Second Edition\n\n【75】 # IMPLEMENTATION RECOMMENDATION 3.0:\nImplement a plan of care to mitigate risk factors that can influence wound healing.\n\n【76】 # Level of Evidence = IV\nDiscussion of Evidence:\n  for a summary of these risk factors.\n\n【77】 # RECOMMENDATION 3.1:\nProvide wound care consisting of debridement, infection control and moisture balance where appropriate.\n\n【78】 # Level of Evidence = Ia -IV\n\n【79】 # Discussion of Evidence:\nLocal wound care is a significant component of the pathway to prevent and manage diabetic foot ulcers (refer to . Wounds have the greatest potential for healing with care that includes:\n- Debridement; 2. Infection control; and 3. Moisture balance.\nAssessment and Management of Foot Ulcers for People with Diabetes, Second Edition If healing potential is not established, aggressive debridement and moist interactive healing is not recommended.\n\n【80】 # Debridement (Level of Evidence = Ia)\n P for a decision-making algorithm for debridement.\nSeveral methods of debridement are available for varying stages of ulcers. The clinical use of enzymatic and biologic methods of debridement was not included as part of the literature base used for this BPG. This guideline will focus on the three most common methods of debridement for diabetic foot ulcers:\n Autolytic;  Mechanical; and  Surgical/Sharp.\n involves the use of moisture in semi-occlusive or occlusive dressings to aid in the efficiency of liquefying devitalized tissue. Dressings for autolytic debridement include hydrocolloids, hydrogels and films . In a Cochrane review to determine the effectiveness of debridement methods for diabetic foot ulcers, Edwards and Stapely  found that hydrogels were significantly more effective than gauze dressings or standard care in healing diabetic foot ulcers.\nMechanical debridement involves manually removing necrotic tissue and debris from a wound bed, using wet-to-dry dressings, saline irrigation or pulsed lavage. Mechanical debridement may be indicated in wounds with moderate levels of necrotic tissue (Enoch & Harding, .\nSurgical or sharp debridement G involves the use of a medical instrument such as a scalpel to excise necrotic tissue. Surgical debridement is often performed in wounds with large volumes of necrotic and infected tissue.\nIn a prospective trial, sharp debridement was associated with greater wound closure in people with diabetic foot ulcers (Saap & Falanga, .\nAssessment and Management of Foot Ulcers for People with Diabetes, Second Edition\nIt should be noted, however, that clinical trials on surgical debridement are inadequately powered. More research is needed to evaluate the methods and effects of all types of debridement .\nSharp debridement is a high-risk procedure and should be undertaken with caution.\nIt is a procedure that must only be performed by trained and experienced health-care professionals, within the policies of the organization.\nPerforming a procedure below the dermis is a controlled act that must be carried out by an authorized health-care professional. Health-care professionals should be aware of their professional scope of practice as well as the policies and procedures within their organization.\n\n【81】 # Callus Reduction\n assist in the prevention and management of foot ulcers. Reducing a callus often involves surgical or sharp debridement, and has been demonstrated to significantly reduce pressure at the callus site by approximately 30% . Callus debridement is within the scope of practice for certain health-care professionals, and may be performed by those with the appropriate knowledge, skills and judgment about the procedure.\n\n【82】 # Infection Control (Level of Evidence = III)\nPreventing or controlling infection in diabetic foot ulcers is essential to prevent complications such as osteomyelitis . J provides details of proper swabbing for wound cultures.  illustrates treatment options recommended by the RNAO expert panel for superficial infection, deep wound infection and systemic infection.\nOnce wound culture results are obtained, antimicrobial G therapy may be tailored to provide specific coverage or therapy against resistant organisms. Antibiotic-resistant organisms, such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) G are an increasing issue with infections in diabetic foot ulcers . Infections involving antibioticresistant organisms require targeted antibiotic therapy. If infection persists while the client is on antibiotic therapy, surgical assessment and wound culture should be considered.\nMoreover, methods to enhance the client's immunity to infections should be considered, which may involve examining co-morbidities, glycemic control, nutritional needs and sleep-wake cycles.\nAssessment and Management of Foot Ulcers for People with Diabetes, Second Edition\n\n【83】 # Non-limb-threatening Infections\n Q for a list of Topical Antimicrobial Agents.\nThere is, however, mixed evidence on the use of antimicrobial agents, specifically, when used with silver-based dressings. In a systematic review of 26 trials comparing silver-containing dressings, creams compared to dressings and creams that did not contain silver, Storm-Versloot, Vos, Ubbink and Vermeulen  concluded that there was insufficient evidence to establish whether silver-containing dressings or topical agents promoted wound healing or prevented wound infections. More research is required, specifically related to diabetic foot ulcers.\nIf topical antimicrobial agents are used, and increased superficial bacterial burden or delayed healing are noted, treatment should be supplemented with debridement and moisture balance. If deep infection is present, or if the wound fails to heal within 2 weeks of topical antimicrobials, systemic antibiotic therapy should be considered. Systemic antibiotic medication may be prescribed by the appropriate health-care professional according to the Anti-Infective Guidelines for Community-acquired Infections (Anti-infective Review Panel, .\n\n【84】 # Limb-Threatening Infections\nInappropriately managed infections in diabetic foot ulcers can lead to life-or limb-threatening consequences. These infections may present with cellulitis extending greater than 2 cm beyond the wound border and cardinal signs of infection, such as fever, edema, lymphangitis, hyperglycemia, leukocytosis and/or ischemia.\nA diabetic foot ulcer presenting with wet gangrene, deep abscesses and advancing cellulitis must be transferred to a medical facility for urgent care.\nHospitalization is required to treat the deep infection and associated systemic effects. Limb-threatening infections require immediate surgical attention, which should not be delayed while waiting for radiologic or medical workup of other co-morbid conditions Weir, . Although many wound care procedures can be done at the bedside for people with diabetic foot ulcers, limb-threatening infections will require thorough debridement in the operating room. Individuals presenting with limb-threatening infections should be considered for emergent incision, drainage and debridement procedures.\n be used, depending on the microbial isolates and infection severity.\nAssessment and Management of Foot Ulcers for People with Diabetes, Second Edition\n\n【85】 # Moisture Balance (Level of Evidence = III)\nThe type of dressing selected for the foot ulcer should promote a moist wound environment that minimizes trauma and risk of infection. Specifically, dressing selection should be based on its ability to provide local moisture balance for the wound to heal. Modern, moisture-promoting dressings used for diabetic foot ulcers include foams (high absorbency), calcium alginates (absorbent, hemostasis), hydrogels (moisture balance), hydrocolloids (occlusion) and adhesive membranes (protection) :\n Assess the wound bed for bacterial balance, exudate level and the need for debridement;  Select a dressing or combination of dressings that can manage and/or control the environment above the wound;  Use a dressing that will keep the wound bed continuously moist and the peri-wound skin dry;  Choose a dressing that controls exudate but does not dry the ulcer bed;  Consider the amount of professional caregiver time needed to apply and change dressing(s);  Eliminate wound dead space by loosely filling all cavities with dressing material;  Ensure that the dressing does not become a source of increased pressure to the affected area;  Confirm that the person with a diabetic foot ulcer is aware of the need to reduce pressure to the affected area; and  Evaluate the wound as prescribed to determine effectiveness of the treatment plan.\nApplication of moisture retentive dressings in the presence of ischemia and/or dry gangrene can result in a serious limb-threatening infection. In the presence of ischemia and/or dry gangrene, apply a drying antimicrobial, such as povidone iodine, a protective dry dressing and ensure proper off-loading.\nThere is mixed comparative evidence on the effectiveness of any particular dressing type to heal diabetic foot ulcers .

Thus, pressure alleviation is integral to prevent the formation of calluses and to promote ulcer wound healing. Pressure alleviation can be accomplished by redistributing pressure over a larger surface area through the application of external pressure offloading devices. A health-care professional skilled in the fabrication and modification of offloading devices, such as a chiropodist or podiatrist, should be consulted when providing pressure redistribution.\n M for a list of offloading devices and selection considerations.\n reported positive healing rates between 70 to 91%, within a period of 34 to 300 days .\nSurgery may be considered if pressure redistributing devices are ineffective or not a viable option. Several surgical procedures were identified for wounds that have not healed at the expected rate (refer to Recommendation 2.2 and O for specific treatment options).\n\n【88】 # RECOMMENDATION 3.3:\nProvide health education to optimize diabetes management, foot care and ulcer care.\n\n【89】 # Level of Evidence = Ia\nDiscussion of Evidence:\nHealth education and its reinforcement is an essential intervention for clients with diabetic foot ulcers. Nurses, as the single largest group of health-care professionals working in a range of settings, are in a pivotal position to provide and reinforce health education related to diabetes management and foot and ulcer care. They may act as the primary diabetes foot care educator, as a link between clients and their primary care providers, or within specialized diabetes care teams (RNAO, . Historically, diabetes education was didactic, but in recent years it has become more participative to address individual variables in the learning process (Whittemore, .\n prevent or delay diabetes-related complications such as peripheral neuropathies and reduced circulation in lower extremities (IWGDF, 2011;RNAO, 2007;UKPDS Group 33, . Furthermore, health education in a group setting and sustained long-term follow-up have both been shown to enhance knowledge and produce positive outcomes, such as improved glycemic control in type 2 diabetes (CDA CPG Expert Committee, .\nAlthough health education seems to have a positive impact on clients' foot and ulcer care knowledge and behaviours, it is uncertain whether it can prevent foot ulceration and amputation. In a Cochrane review of randomized controlled trials evaluating the impact of client education on diabetic foot ulceration, Dorresteijn, Kriegsman, Assendelft and Valk  concluded that there is insufficient evidence to ascertain whether client education, without additional preventative measures, reduces ulcer incidence. It should be noted, however, that the methodology of inquiry must be in keeping with the research question and that randomized controlled trials may not always be the appropriate design for every question.\n S for a client handout on diabetic foot care.\nAssessment and Management of Foot Ulcers for People with Diabetes, Second Edition\n\n【90】 # RECOMMENDATION 3.4:\nFacilitate client-centred learning based on individual needs to prevent or reduce complications.\n\n【91】 # Level of Evidence = III\n\n【92】 # Discussion of Evidence:\nDiabetic foot care education may support health promotion G strategies when presented in a way that is meaningful and easily understood by the client ). This assessment should include the client's learning preferences, individual characteristics and relevant social determinants of health.\n\n【93】 # Learning Preferences\nClients have diverse learning preferences that may or may not align with the health-care professional's personal teaching style. Every client should be given the opportunity to learn in his/her preferred manner (RNAO, 2012a).\nThe health-care professional should adapt the learning session to meet the client's learning needs and preferences.\n\n【94】 # Individual Characteristics\nPersonal attitudes, cultural beliefs, level of literacy, age and physical condition all influence an individual's ability to carry out the recommended regimen (American Association of Diabetes Educators, 1999; Canadian Diabetes Association -Diabetes Educator , .

Is wound healing progressing at the expected rate? 3. Is the treatment plan effective?\nWound healing progress should be evaluated on an on-going and systematic basis. In a prospective, randomized controlled trial, Sheehan  found that a 50% reduction in wound surface area at 4 weeks was a good predictor of wound healing at 12 weeks. This finding was further supported by other research evidence, which showed that poor wound healing at 4 weeks was a strong predictor for non-healing at 12 weeks (Flanagan, 2003;Warriner, Snyder, & Cardinal, . Furthermore, in a recent retrospective analysis of two randomized controlled trials of diabetic foot ulcer healing,  identified that wound healing at 12 weeks was substantially greater in wounds demonstrating more than 90% wound closure at 8 weeks. Therefore, progress of wound healing at 4 and 8 weeks may be correlated with wound closure at 12 weeks.\nAssessment tools should be consistently used when monitoring and evaluating the progress of foot ulcer healing. The Pressure Ulcer Scale for Healing tool .\n T for the PUSH Tool.\nFurthermore, if a diabetic foot ulcer does not achieve a 50% reduction in surface area at 4 weeks, a comprehensive re-assessment of the treatment plan should be conducted before advanced healing technologies are considered.\nAssessment and Management of Foot Ulcers for People with Diabetes, Second Edition\n\n【98】 # RECOMMENDATION 4.1:\nReassess for additional correcfactors if healing does not occur at the expected rate.\n\n【99】 # Level of Evidence = IV\n\n【100】 # Discussion of Evidence:\n provide useful information to identify potential barriers to wound healing (Collins & Toiba, .\nThe most common reason for delayed wound healing in a diabetic foot ulcer is inadequate pressure offloading.\nInadequate pressure offloading can be due to poor client adherence to offloading devices or a lack of prescription for offloading devices. Poor client adherence to prescribed offloading devices may be due to a variety of reasons. Nurses should assess the client's knowledge about the benefits of pressure-reducing devices, encourage the communication of concerns and engage in health teaching. Identifying strategies that promote informed and engaged clients may be the most critical aspect of care-planning and to ensure adherence to offloading and pressure redistribution devices. If appropriate offloading is not prescribed, however, the person with the diabetic foot ulcer should be referred to a centre specializing in diabetic foot ulcer care.\nAppropriate follow-up measures may be indicated for non-healing wounds where all possible correcfactors have been addressed. Several adjunctive approaches can be considered for persistent non-healing wounds (refer to Recommendation 2.2 and O for specific treatment options).\n\n【101】 # Level of Evidence = IV\n\n【102】 # Discussion of Evidence:\nAssessment and treatment of people with diabetic foot ulcers is a complex and dynamic process that requires a team of health-care professionals with specialized knowledge and skills. The knowledge and skills necessary to assess and treat a person with a diabetic foot ulcer are not taught in an entry level program. Therefore, team members should participate in accredited continuing education opportunities to receive specific wound care training with appropriate provisions of time, access and funding from their health-care organization. The team should adopt a client-centred approach G and have a sound knowledge base enabling them to problem solve and ensure interventions are evidence based according to organizational policies and procedures.\nRefer to U for a list of resources for diabetic foot ulcer information.\n\n【103】 # RECOMMENDATION 5.1:\nEducational institutions incorporate the RNAO Nursing Best Practice Guideline, Assessment and Management of Foot Ulcers for People with Diabetes (2 nd ed.), into basic registered nurse, registered practical nurse, doctor of medicine and interprofessional curricula to promote a culture of evidence-based practice.\n\n【104】 # Level of Evidence = IV\n\n【105】 # Discussion of Evidence:\n in a pivotal position to facilitate an evidence-based team approach to treatment IWGDF, .\nThe RNAO expert panel suggests incorporating the RNAO Nursing Best Practice Guideline, Assessment and Management of Foot Ulcers for People with Diabetes (2 nd ed.), into interprofessional curricula to ensure health-care professionals are exposed to and provided with evidence-based knowledge, skills and tools that are needed to assist in assessing and managing people with diabetic foot ulcers.\nAssessment and Management of Foot Ulcers for People with Diabetes, Second Edition\nOrganization and Policy Recommendations RECOMMENDATION 6.0:\nUse a systematic approach to implement the Assessment and Management of Foot Ulcers for People with Diabetes (2 nd ed.) clinical practice guideline and provide resources and organizational and administrative supports to facilitate clinician uptake.\n\n【106】 # Level of Evidence = IV\nDiscussion of Evidence:.\nAn effective organizational plan for guideline implementation includes:\n An assessment of organizational readiness and barriers to implementation, taking into account local circumstances;  Involvement of all members (whether in a direct or indirect supportive function) in the implementation process;  Ongoing educational opportunities to reinforce the importance of best practices;  One or more qualified individual(s) to provide the support needed for the education and implementation process; and  Opportunities for reflection on personal and organizational experience in implementing guidelines.\nSuccessful implementation of best practice guidelines requires the use of a structured, systematic planning process and strong leadership from nurses who are able to transform the evidence-based recommendations into policies, procedures and nursing-related practices that impact on care within the organization.

This role includes advocating for increased availability of and accessibility to diabetic foot ulcer care. To achieve optimal outcomes for people with diabetic foot ulcers, emphasis should be placed on an interprofessional health-care team that can establish and sustain an effective communication network between the client and their immediate health-care system. Teams may collaborate virtually to coordinate efforts and ensure goals are consistently met . Furthermore, interprofessional diabetes foot ulcer care should be community-based and considerate of age, gender, cultural beliefs and socioeconomic dispositions. Through a retrospective review of the literature, Frykberg  reported a reduction in non-traumatic amputation rates ranging from 58 to 100% after the implementation of an interprofessional approach to foot care.\nAssessment and Management of Foot Ulcers for People with Diabetes, Second Edition Key members of the team, along with the client and their family, may inclu\n\n【111】 # RECOMMENDATION 6.4:\nAdvocate for strategies and ongoing funding to assist clients in obtaining appropriate pressure redistribution devices during and after ulcer closure.\n\n【112】 # Level of Evidence = IV\n\n【113】 # Discussion of Evidence:\nAn organizational commitment to provide care and make available pressure redistribution devices is required to ensure quality health outcomes in foot ulcer management. As offloading devices may vary greatly in cost, the selection and effectiveness of appropriate devices should be continually assessed on an individual basis to optimize quality care. While the costs of pressure redistribution devices are substantial, it is important that such costs are viewed in relation to the total cost of care for foot ulcer and increased risk of amputation . Nurses may advocate for strategies and ongoing funding that increase the accessibility of pressure redistribution devices for clients with foot ulcers in the hospital and community setting.\nAssessment and Management of Foot Ulcers for People with Diabetes, Second Edition\n\n【114】 # Research Gaps and Future Implications\nThe RNAO expert panel, in reviewing the evidence for this edition of the guideline, identified the following priority research areas, many of which were identified in the first edition. These areas have been broadly categorized into practice, outcomes and health system research  .\n\n【115】 # HEALTH SYSTEM RESEARCH\nHealth delivery issues (government support and funding of programs and treatment for diabetic foot ulcer management, cultural beliefs, high-risk patient populations)\nHealth economic evaluations of secondary and tertiary prevention strategies\nThe above , although in no way exhaustive, is an attempt to identify and prioritize the critical amount of research that is needed in this area. Many of the recommendations in the guideline are based on quantitative and qualitative research evidence. Other recommendations are based on consensus or expert opinion. Further substantive research is required to validate the expert opinion. Increasing the research evidence can impact knowledge that will lead to improved practice and outcomes for people who experience diabetic foot ulcers.\nAssessment and Management of Foot Ulcers for People with Diabetes, Second Edition\n\n【116】 # Evaluation/Monitoring of Guideline\nOrganizations implementing the recommendations in this nursing BPG are advised to consider how their implementation, and their impact, will be monitored and evaluated. The impact of BPG implementation and sustained use of evidence-based practice can be evaluated objectively through regular review of the utilization of the Nursing Order Sets G and their effect on client health outcomes. Nursing Order Sets embedded within clinical information systems simplify this process by providing a mechanism for electronic data capture.  Cost related to implementing guideline:\n Education and access to on-the-job supports.\n New documentation systems.\n Support systems.\nAssessment and Management of Foot Ulcers for People with Diabetes, Second Edition\n\n【117】 # Implementation Strategies\nGuideline implementation at the point of care is multifaceted and challenging at all levels. The uptake of knowledge in any practice setting requires more than the awareness and distribution of guidelines. Application of the guideline in any practice setting requires adaptation for the local context. Adaptation must be systematic and participatory to ensure recommendations are customized to fit the local context (Straus, Tetroe, & Graham . The Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario recommends the use of the Toolk\nThe Toolkit is based on emerging evidence that the likelihood of achieving successful uptake of best practice in health care increases when:\n Leaders at all levels are committed to support facilitation of guideline implementation  Guidelines are selected for implementation through a systematic, participatory process  Stakeholders relevant to the focus of the guideline are identified, and engaged in the implementation process  An environmental readiness assessment for implementation is conducted for its impact on guideline uptake  The guideline is tailored to the local context  Barriers and facilitators to use of the guideline are assessed and addressed  Interventions are selected that promote guideline use  Guideline use is systematically monitored and sustained  Evaluation of the impacts of guideline use is embedded into the process  There are adequate resources to complete the activities related to all aspects of guideline implementation\nThe Toolkit uses the knowledge-to-action model that depicts the process of choosing a guideline in the centre triangle, and follows a detailed step-by-step direction for implementing guideline recommendations at the local level. These steps are illustrated in : \"Knowledge to Action\" framework .\nAssessment and Management of Foot Ulcers for People with Diabetes, Second Edition A full version of the Toolk\nIn addition, RNAO is committed to widespread deployment and implementation of the guidelines and utilizes a coordinated approach to dissemination incorporating a variety of strategies. Guideline implementation is facilitated through RNAO specific initiatives that include the Nursing Best Practice Champion Network, which serves to develop the capacity of individual nurses and foster awareness, engagement and adoption of BPGs; and the Best Practice Spotlight Organization (BPSO) Designation that supports BPG implementation at the organizational and system levels. BPSOs focus on developing evidence-based cultures with the specific mandate to implement, evaluate and sustain multiple RNAO clinical practice BPGs. In addition to these strategies, capacitybuilding learning institutes related to specific BPGs and their implementation are held annually. (RNAO, 2012b, p. 19-.\nFurther information about each of these implementation strategies can be found at:  Process For Guideline Update/ Review of Guideline\nThe Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario (RNAO) commits to update its best practice guidelines (BPG) as follows:\n- Each nursing BPG will be reviewed by a team of specialists (RNAO Expert Panel) in the topic area -to be completed every 5 years following publication of the last edition.\nBest Practice Guideline (IaBPG) Centre staff will regularly monitor for new systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials, and other relevant literature in the field.\n- Based on the results of this monitoring, RNAO IaBPG Centre staff may recommend an earlier revision period.\nAppropriate consultation with a team of members comprised of original RNAO Expert Panel members and other specialists and experts in the field will help inform the decision to review and revise the guidelines earlier than the targeted milestone.

A final summary of literature findings was completed. The comprehensive data s and summary were provided to all panel members. In September 2012, the RNAO expert panel convened to achieve consensus on the need to update the original guideline recommendations and discussion of evidence.\nA review of the most recent literature and relevant guidelines published between 2004 and 2012 resulted in refinements to existing recommendations, as well as inclusion of stronger evidence for the recommendations. This second edition of the guideline is a culmination of the original work and the new literature. The following flow s of the review process for guidelines and articles are presented according to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines (Moher, Liberati, Ttzlaff, Altman & The PRISMA Group, .

However, this technique is clearly less precise. The frequency distribution of the size of the ulcers should be reported in each study as quartiles.\n\n【129】 # Depth/Tissue Loss\nDepth is difficult to determine and relative; an ulcer which is only a few millimeters deep on a toe can penetrate into bone or a joint, but, in other regions, ulcers can be several centimeters deep without involvement of deeper structures. Therefore, ulcers are divided into lesions confined to the skin and those deeper than the skin. Even if an ulcer does not seem to penetrate below the skin, clinical infection in subcutaneous tissues (e.g., an abscess or osteomyelitis) means it is a \"deep\" ulcer. The extent of tissue loss should be evaluated after initial debridement, but this should be performed judiciously when critical limb ischemia (Grade  is suspected.\n\n【130】 # GRADE 1\nSuperficial full thickness ulcer, not penetrating any structure deeper than the dermis.\n\n【131】 # GRADE 2\nDeep ulcer, penetrating below the dermis to subcutaneous structures, involving fascia, muscle, or tendon.\n\n【132】 # GRADE 3\nAll subsequent layers of the foot involved, including bone and/or joint (exposed bone, probing to bone).\nInfection of a diabetic foot ulcer is defined as invasion and multiplication of microorganisms in body tissues associated with tissue destruction or a host inflammatory response. Infection is defined clinically, by the symptoms and signs of inflammation as described below, regardless of the results of any wound culture.\nStudies on accuracy and validity of different tests for diagnosing infection in diabetic foot disease are scarce. Therefore, the scheme described below is based mainly on expert opinion.\n frequently used. However, this category is very difficult to define and overlaps with the other categories.\n\n【133】 # A P P E N D I C E S\nAssessment and Management of Foot Ulcers for People with Diabetes, Second Edition\nNo symptoms or signs of infection\nInfection involving the skin and the subcutaneous tissue only (without involvement of deeper tissues and without systemic signs as described below). At least 2 of the following items are present:\n local swelling or induration;\n erythema > 0.5 to 2 cm around the ulcer;\n local tenderness or pain;\n local warmth; and/or  purulent discharge (thick, opaque to white or sanguineous secretion).\nOther causes of an inflammatory response of the skin should be excluded (e.g., trauma, gout, acute Charcot neuro-osteoarthropathy, fracture, thrombosis, venous stasis).\nErythema > 2 cm plus one of the items described above (swelling, tenderness, warmth, discharge) or Infection involving structures deeper than skin and subcutaneous tissues such as abscess, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, fasciitis.\nNo systemic inflammatory response signs, as described below.\nAny foot infection with the following signs of a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This response is manifested by two or more of the following conditions:\n Temperature > 38 or < 36 Celsius;\n Heart rate > 90 beats/min;\n Respiratory rate > 20 breaths/min;  PaCO2 < 32 mmHg;\n White blood cell count > 12.000 or < 4.000/cu mm; and/or  10% immature (band) forms.\n\n【134】 # A P P E N D I C E S\nAssessment and Management of Foot Ulcers for People with Diabetes, Second Edition\nThe system categorizes patients as having present or absent protective sensation in the affected foot. The system does not categorise patients as having (diabetic) polyneuropathy, and additional information is needed for this diagnosis. Moreover, it does not provide information on the cause of the loss of protective sensation, nor is the severity of the sensory loss graded. Both pressure and vibration sensation should be determined in each patient.\n\n【135】 # GRADE 1\nNo loss of protective sensation on the affected foot detected, defined as the presence of sensory modalities described below.\n\n【136】 # GRADE 2\nLoss of protective sensation on the affected foot is defined as the absence of perception of the one of the following tests in the affected foot:\n Absent pressure sensation, determined with a 10 gram Monofilament, on 2 out of 3 sites on the plantar side of the foot, as described in the International Consensus on the Diabetic Foot; and/or  Absent vibration sensation, (determined with a 128 Hz tuning fork) or vibration threshold > 25 V, (using semi-quantitative techniques), both tested on the hallux.\nNote.

There are many reasons for this condition, the first of which is heredity.\n\n【137】 # A P P E N D I C E S\nMany have this condition and never experience problems of any kind.\nHowever, others will have this condition created through years in soft, unsupportive shoes on hard surfaces, injury, pregnancy, or other factors.\n helps to maintain all the tarsals in proper erect anatomic position. As this arch decreases, impact from the concrete becomes worse.\nWhen the arch ligament stretches or tears, the arch falls. If it falls far enough, the tarsals may begin to shift to the inside or create pronation or a valgus (greater than 90 degree erect) position at the ankle. This can cause problems in the origin area (the metatarsals) or in the heel.\n may cause pressure on the medial (inner) knee and perhaps the hip and back. It is like pulling the string on a marionette too tight, the result is a kinked mass on one side. The human body is much the same; place too much tension on major muscle groups and the joints kink and yell back.\n\n【138】 # A P P E N D I C E S\nAssessment and Management of Foot Ulcers for People with Diabetes, Second Edition\n\n【139】 # DEFORMITY DESCRIPTION\nPes Cavus (vs normal arch):\nIn pes cavus, the arch is abnormally high on weight bearing. The heel is often tilted inwards at the ankle (but not always). In many, the toes will appear clawed. When not standing, the front half of the foot (forefoot) will appear to be dropped below the level of the rear foot. Ledoux  identified biomechanical differences among pes planus and pes cavus feet in persons with diabetes. They found pes cavus feet had more prominent metatarsal heads, bony prominences, hammer/claw toes, increased hallux dorsiflexion and pes cavus decreased hallux plantarflexion.\n\n【140】 # A P P E N D I C E S\nAssessment and Management of Foot Ulcers for People with Diabetes, Second Edition\n\n【141】 # DEFORMITY DESCRIPTION\nCharcot Arthropathy (vs normal arch): One in 680 people with diabetes develop Charcot joint with an incidence of 9 to 12% individuals with documented diabetic peripheral neuropathy (Royal Melbourne Hospital, . Charcot joint is a form of neuroarthropathy that occurs most often in the foot. Nerve damage from diabetes causes decreased sensation, muscle and ligamental atrophy and subsequent joint instability. The charcot joint process can affect many areas of the foot. Most commonly it affects the Lisfranc joint (tarsometatarsal) region. The deformity in this area manifests as the typical rocker bottom type foot. The second most commonly affected area is the rear foot, or the talar-navicular region. The ankle joint and forefoot are more rarely involved.\n important to note that charcot may affect more than one region of the foot, and these different areas may each be at a different stage of the progression of the deformity. Walking on this insensitive and weakened joint can cause even more damage to the foot structure.\nIn the acute stage there is inflammation and bone reabsorption that destroys the bone. In later stages, the arch falls and the foot may develop a rocker bottom appearance. Weight distribution of the sole is altered causing deformities leading to pressure points that enhance ulcer development. Signs of charcot arthopathy include swelling of the foot and leg, changes in the shape of the foot or ankle, feeling of instability, crunching feelings or sounds, and marked increase in temperature of the foot. Symptoms include pain or discomfort, pain at rest and burning sensations. It is important that the charcot foot is recognized early so that appropriate treatment of the foot can be provided to prevent further injury and promote a sfoot .\nFor patient information on charcot arthropathy, visit \n\n【142】 # A P P E N D I C E S\nAssessment and Management of Foot Ulcers for People with Diabetes, Second Edition\n\n【143】 # DEFORMITY DESCRIPTION\nLimited Joint Mobility Progressive stiffening of collagen-containing tissues leads to thickening of the skin, loss of joint mobility, and potential fixed flexor deformity. Up to 30% of people with diabetes may have limited joint mobility. Reduction in mobility of the ankle joint may cause increased plantar pressure when walking and be a major risk factor in the pathogenesis of diabetic foot ulcers (Fernando, Masson, Veves & Boulton, 1991;Zimny, Schatz & Pfohl, .

In order to meet this commitment, a monitoring and revision process has been established for each guideline every 5 years.\nFor this edition of the guideline, RNAO assembled an expert panel of health-care professionals comprised of members from the previous development panel as well as other recommended individuals with particular expertise in this practice area. A systematic review of the evidence based on the scope of the original guideline and supported by four clinical questions was conducted to capture the relevant literature and guidelines published between 2004 and 2012. The following research questions were established to guide the systematic review:\n- What are the most effective methods for the assessment of foot ulcer in clients with diabetes?\n- What are the most effective interventions to manage foot ulcers and prevent re-ulceration in clients with diabetes?\n- What health-care professional education and training is required to ensure the provision of effective diabetic foot ulcer care?\n- How do health-care organizations support and promote optimal assessment and management of foot ulcers in clients with diabetes?\nThe RNAO expert panel members were given a mandate to review the original guideline (March  in light of the new evidence, specifically to ensure the validity, appropriateness and safety of the guideline recommendations.\nWhere necessary, sections of the guideline have been updated based on new evidence. This current edition  is the culmination of the RNAO expert panel's work in integrating the most current and best evidence to update the guideline recommendations and supporting evidence from the first edition.\n\n【160】 # C: Process for Systematic Review/Search Strategy\n\n【161】 # Guideline Review\n identified by members of the RNAO expert panel.\nMembers of the panel critically appraised nine international guidelines using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation Instrument II .

This causes clawing at the toe and possible subluxation of the metatarsophalangeal joints.

A case series of 84 patients reported a disease-free survival of 83% (70/ at a mean follow-up of 18 months.\nThe study of 65 patients reported a lower mean requirement for analgesia in the laparoscopic group than in the open cystectomy group (32 mg and 65 mg % morphine equivalent, respectively; p = 0.. The study of 42 patients reported a mean requirement for non-opioid analgesics of 2.2 vials/day in the laparoscopic group compared with 3.9 vials/day in the open cystectomy group (p < 0..\nThe Specialist Advisers considered that key efficacy outcomes included need for blood transfusion, time to discharge, requirement for analgesia, time to return to full activity, histology clear margin rates, extent of lymph node dissection and cancer-specific 5-year survival. One stated that the procedure has not been performed for long enough or in sufficient numbers to be able to evaluate the incidence of local recurrence of cancer or subsequent metastases.\n\n【5】 # Safety\nConversion to open surgery was reported in 5% (1/ and 3% (1/ of patients in two non-randomised controlled trials, and 0% (0/ and 2% (2/ in two case series.\nFistulae (including vaginal, urinary and enterovesical) were reported in 1% (1/, 2% (2/, 3% (1/ and 8% (1/ of patients in the two case series of 83 and 84 patients, the non-randomised controlled trial of 54 patients comparing open cystectomy with robotically assisted cystectomies, and a further non-randomised controlled trial of 37 patients, respectively.

Other complications included abdominal abscess (8% ), percutaneous drainage of abscess (3% ), injury to artery (1% ), urinary leakage (1% ), urinary tract infection (10% ) and haematoma (4% ).\nThere was a case report of port site metastasis in a patient 10 months after laparoscopic cystectomy; the patient was reported to have high-grade, high-stage transitional cell carcinoma.\nOne Specialist Adviser considered that theoretical adverse events included difficulty controlling haemorrhage, bowel injury or obstruction, inadequate cancer clearance and port site metastasis. The Specialist Advisers stated that anecdotal adverse events include bowel fistula, peritonitis and prolonged operative time. One Adviser stated that the laparoscopic technique may not allow as radical an excision as open surgery, particularly for lymph nodes.\n\n【6】 # Other comments\nThe Committee noted that the published evidence on laparoscopic cystectomy was in patients with bladder cancer. There may be other patients for whom the procedure might be beneficial: they should be referred by the specialist teams caring for them to units with experience in case selection and use of laparoscopic cystectomy  1.2 and 1..\nThe Committee noted that most surgeons had stopped doing bladder reconstruction laparoscopically as part of this procedure.# Further information\nNICE has issued cancer service guidance on urological cancers.\n\n【7】 # Information for patients\nNICE has produced information on this procedure for patients and carers ('Understanding NICE guidance').

Initiate letermovir between Day 0 and Day 28 post-transplantation (before or after engraftment), and continue through Day 100 post-transplantation. Dosage of letermovir should be adjusted when co-administered with cyclosporine.\n- Letermovir injection, which contains hydroxypropyl betadex, should be used only in patients unable to take oral therapy. Patients should be switched to oral letermovir as soon as they are able to take oral medications. Letermovir t and injection may be used interchangeably at the discretion of the physician, and no dosage adjustment is necessary when switching formulations.\n- If oral or intravenous letermovir is co-administered with cyclosporine, the dosage of letermovir should be decreased to 240 mg once daily.\n- If cyclosporine is initiated after starting letermovir, the next dose of letermovir should be decreased to 240 mg once daily.\n- If cyclosporine is discontinued after starting letermovir, the next dose of letermovir should be increased to 480 mg once daily.\n- If cyclosporine dosing is interrupted due to high cyclosporine levels, no dose adjustment of letermovir is needed.\n- For patients with creatinine clearance (CLcr) greater than 10 mL/min, no dosage adjustment of letermovir is required based on renal impairment.\n- There are insufficient data in patients with CLcr 10 mL/min or less or in patients on dialysis to make letermovir dosing recommendations.\n- In patients with CLcr less than 50 mL/min receiving letermovir injection, accumulation of the intravenous vehicle, hydroxypropyl betadex, may occur. Closely monitor serum creatinine levels in these patients.\n- No dosage adjustment of letermovir is required for patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment.

Adverse events were those reported while subjects were on study medication or within two weeks of study medication completion/discontinuation. The mean time for reporting adverse events and laboratory abnormalities was approximately 22% longer in the letermovir arm compared to the placebo arm.\n- The cardiac adverse event rate (regardless of investigator-assessed causality) was higher in subjects receiving letermovir (13%) compared to subjects receiving placebo (6%). The most common cardiac adverse events were tachycardia (reported in 4% of letermovir subjects and in 2% of placebo subjects) and atrial fibrillation (reported in 3% of letermovir subjects and in 1% of placebo subjects). Among those subjects who experienced one or more cardiac adverse events, 85% of letermovir and 92% of placebo subjects had events reported as mild or moderate in severity.\n- The rate of adverse events occurring in at least 10% of subjects in the letermovir group and at a frequency at least 2% greater than placebo are outlined in \n- Overall, similar proportions of subjects in each group discontinued study medication due to an adverse event (13% of letermovir subjects vs. 12% of placebo subjects). The most frequently reported adverse event that led to study drug discontinuation was nausea, occurring in 2% of letermovir subjects and 1% of placebo subjects. Hypersensitivity reaction, with associated moderate dyspnea, occurred in one subject following the first infusion of IV letermovir after switching from oral letermovir, leading to treatment discontinuation.\nLaboratory Abnormalities\n- Selected laboratory abnormalities reported during treatment or within 2 weeks of stopping treatment are presented in the below.\n- The median time to engraftment (defined as absolute neutrophil count ≥ 500/mm3 on 3 consecutive days after transplantation) was 19 days in the letermovir group and 18 days in the placebo group.\n\n【17】 ## Postmarketing Experience\nThere is limited information regarding Letermovir Postmarketing Experience in the drug label.\n\n【18】 # Drug Interactions\n- Potential for Other Drugs to Affect Letermovir\n- Potential for Letermovir to Affect Other Drugs\n- Established and Other Potentially Significant Drug Interactions\n- Drugs without Clinically Significant Interactions with Letermovir\n- Letermovir is a substrate of organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1B1/3 (OATP1B1/ transporters.

In animal reproduction studies, embryo-fetal developmental toxicity (including fetal malformations) was observed in rats during the period of organogenesis at letermovir exposures (AUC) 11 times higher than human exposure at the recommended human dose (RHD). In rabbits, no embryo-fetal developmental toxicity was noted at exposures that were not maternally toxic (up to letermovir exposures 2 times higher than human exposure at the RHD). In a rat pre/post-natal development study, total litter loss was observed at maternal letermovir exposures approximately 2 times higher than human exposure at the RHD.\n- The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively.\n- Letermovir was administered orally to pregnant rats at 0, 10, 50 or 250 mg/kg/day from gestation days 6 to 17. Developmental toxicities, including skeletal malformations and umbilical cord shortening, were observed at 250 mg/kg/day (approximately 11 times higher than human exposure at the RHD). In addition, decreased fetal body weight and skeletal variations (due to maternal toxicity) were observed at this dose. No embryo-fetal toxicities were observed at 50 mg/kg/day (approximately 3 times higher than human exposure at the RHD).\n- Letermovir was administered orally to pregnant rabbits at 0, 25, 75 or 225 mg/kg/day from gestation days 6 to 20. Developmental toxicities, including spontaneous abortion, increased post-implantation loss, and skeletal variations, were observed at a maternally toxic dose (225 mg/kg/day; approximately 2 times higher than human exposure at the RHD). No embryo-fetal toxicities were observed at 75 mg/kg/day (less than human exposure at the RHD).\n- In the pre/post-natal development study, letermovir was administered orally to pregnant rats at 0, 10, 45 or 180 mg/kg/day from gestation day 6 to lactation day 22. At 180 mg/kg/day (approximately 2 times higher than human exposure at the RHD), total litter loss due to stillbirth or possible maternal neglect was observed in 5 of 23 pregnant females by post-partum/lactation day 4. In surviving offspring, slight developmental delays in vaginal opening and pinna unfolding were accompanied by reduced body weight gain at this dose. No toxicities were observed at 45 mg/kg/day (similar to human exposure at the RHD).\nPregnancy Category (AUS): \nThere is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Letermovir in women who are pregnant.\n\n【21】 ### Labor and Delivery\nThere is no FDA guidance on use of Letermovir during labor and delivery.\n\n【22】 ### Nursing Mothers\n- It is not known whether letermovir is present in human breast milk, affects human milk production, or has effects on the breastfed child.\n- When administered to lactating rats, letermovir was present in the milk of lactating rats as well as the blood of nursing pups.\n- The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for letermovir and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from letermovir or from the underlying maternal condition.\n detected in the blood of nursing pups on post-partum/lactation day 21 in the pre/post-natal developmental study.\n\n【23】 ### Pediatric Use\n- Safety and efficacy of letermovir in patients below 18 years of age have not been established.\n\n【24】 ### Geriatic Use\n- Of the 373 subjects treated with letermovir in Trial P001, 56 (15%) subjects were 65 years of age or older. Safety and efficacy were similar across older and younger subjects. No dosage adjustment of letermovir is required based on age.\n\n【25】 ### Gender\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Letermovir with respect to specific gender populations.\n\n【26】 ### Race\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Letermovir with respect to specific racial populations.\n\n【27】 ### Renal Impairment\n- For patients with CLcr greater than 10 mL/min (by Cockcroft-Gault equation), no dosage adjustment of letermovir is required based on renal impairment. The safety of letermovir in patients with end-stage renal disease (CLcr less than 10 mL/min), including patients on dialysis, is unknown.\n- In patients with CLcr less than 50 mL/min receiving letermovir injection, accumulation of the intravenous vehicle, hydroxypropyl betadex, could occur. Closely monitor serum creatinine levels in these patients.\n\n【28】 ### Hepatic Impairment\n- No dosage adjustment of letermovir is required for patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment. Letermovir is not recommended for patients with severe (Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment.\n\n【29】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\n- There are no data on the effect of letermovir on human fertility. Decreased fertility due to testicular toxicity was observed in male rats.\n\n【30】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\nThere is no FDA guidance one the use of Letermovir in patients who are immunocompromised.\n\n【31】 # Administration and Monitoring\n\n【32】 ### Administration\n- Letermovir ts\n- Administer with or without food.\n- Swallow ts whole.\n- Letermovir Injection\n- Administer by intravenous infusion via a peripheral catheter or central venous line at a constant rate over 1 hour.\n- Do not administer as an intravenous bolus injection.\n- Letermovir injection is supplied in 30 mL single-dose vials containing either 240 mg/12 mL per vial (20 mg/mL) or 480 mg/24 mL per vial (20 mg/mL). The preparation and administration instructions are the same for either dose.\n- Letermovir vials are for single use only.

In case of overdose, it is recommended that the patient be monitored for adverse reactions and appropriate symptomatic treatment be instituted.\n- It is unknown whether dialysis will result in meaningful removal of letermovir from systemic circulation.\n\n【36】 # Pharmacology\n\n【37】 ## Mechanism of Action\n- Letermovir is an antiviral drug against CMV.\n\n【38】 ## Structure\n\n【39】 ## Pharmacodynamics\n- In a thorough QT trial in healthy subjects, letermovir at the therapeutic IV dose or at a dose of 2 times the approved IV dose did not prolong QTc to any clinically relevant extent.\n\n【40】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n- The pharmacokinetic properties of letermovir are displayed in \nPediatric Population\n- The pharmacokinetics of letermovir in patients less than 18 years of age have not been evaluated.\nAge, Gender, Race, and Weight\n- Age (18 to 78 years), gender, race (White vs. non-White), and body weight (up to 100 kg) did not have a clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of letermovir.\nRenal Impairment\n- Letermovir AUC was approximately 1.9- and 1.4-fold higher in subjects with moderate (eGFR greater than or equal to 30 to 59 mL/min/1.73m and severe (eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73m renal impairment, respectively, compared to healthy subjects.\n- Hydroxypropyl betadex present in the intravenous letermovir formulation is mainly eliminated by glomerular filtration. Decreased elimination of hydroxypropyl betadex has been reported in the literature in patients with severe renal impairment.\nHepatic Impairment\n- Letermovir AUC was approximately 1.6- and 3.8-fold higher in subjects with moderate (Child-Pugh Class B , score of 7- and severe (Child-Pugh Class C , score of 10- hepatic impairment, respectively, compared to healthy subjects.\n- Drug interaction studies were performed in healthy subjects with letermovir and drugs likely to be co-administered or drugs commonly used as probes for pharmacokinetic interactions.\n- In vitro results indicate that letermovir is a substrate of drug metabolizing enzymes CYP3A, CYP2D6, UGT1A1, and UGT1A3, and transporters OATP1B1/3 and P-gp. Oxidative metabolism is considered to be a minor elimination pathway based on in vivo human data. Inhibitors of OATP1B1/3 may result in increases in letermovir plasma concentrations. Changes in letermovir plasma concentrations due to inhibition of P-gp or UGTs are not anticipated to be clinically relevant.\n- Based on in vitro studies, the metabolism of letermovir is not mediated by CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C18, CYP2C19, CYP2E1, CYP4A11, UGT1A4, UGT1A6, UGT1A7, UGT1A8, UGT1A9, UGT1A10, UGT2B4, UGT2B7, UGT2B15, or UGT2B17. The transport of letermovir is not mediated by OATP2B1, OCT1, OAT1, BCRP, or MRP2 in vitro.\n- Letermovir is a time-dependent inhibitor and inducer of CYP3A in vitro. Co-administration of letermovir with midazolam resulted in increased exposure of midazolam, indicating that the net effect of letermovir on CYP3A is moderate inhibition. Based on these results, co-administration of letermovir with CYP3A substrates may increase the plasma concentrations of the CYP3A substrates. Letermovir is a reversible inhibitor of CYP2C8 in vitro. When co-administered with letermovir, plasma concentrations of CYP2C8 substrates are predicted to be increased. Co-administration of letermovir reduced the exposure of voriconazole, most likely due to the induction of voriconazole elimination pathways, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. Co-administration of letermovir with CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 substrates may decrease the plasma concentrations of the CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 substrates. Letermovir is an inducer of CYP2B6 in vitro; the clinical relevance is unknown.\n- Letermovir inhibited efflux transporters P-gp, breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), bile salt export pump (BSEP), multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP, OAT3, and hepatic uptake transporter OATP1B1/3 in vitro. Co-administration of letermovir with substrates of OATP1B1/3 transporters (e.g. atorvastatin, a known substrate of CYP3A, OATP1B1/3, and potentially BCRP) may result in a clinically relevant increase in plasma concentrations of OATP1B1/3 substrates. There were no clinically relevant changes in plasma concentrations of digoxin, a P-gp substrate, or acyclovir, an OAT3 substrate, following co-administration with letermovir in clinical studies. The effect of letermovir on BCRP, BSEP, and MRP2 substrates was not evaluated in clinical studies; the clinical relevance is unknown.\n- Based on in vitro results letermovir is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, UGT1A4, UGT1A6, UGT1A9, or UGT2B7 and is not an inducer of CYP1A2. Letermovir is not an inhibitor of MRP2, OATP2B1, BSEP, OCT1, OCT2, or OAT1 in vitro.\n- Letermovir inhibits the CMV DNA terminase complex (pUL51, pUL56, and pUL which is required for viral DNA processing and packaging. Biochemical characterization and electron microscopy demonstrated that letermovir affects the production of proper unit length genomes and interferes with virion maturation. Genotypic characterization of virus resistant to letermovir confirmed that letermovir targets the terminase complex.\n- The median EC50 value of letermovir against a collection of clinical CMV isolates in a cell-culture model of infection was 2.1 nM (range = 0.7 nM to 6.1 nM, n = . There was no significant difference in EC50 value by CMV gB genotype (gB1=29; gB2=27; gB3=11; and gB4=.\n- No antagonism of the antiviral activity was seen when letermovir was combined with CMV DNA polymerase inhibitors (cidofovir, foscarnet, or ganciclovir).\nIn Cell Culture\n- CMV mutants with reduced susceptibility to letermovir have been selected in cell culture and the resistance mutations map to UL56. Resistance-associated substitutions occur between amino acid positions pUL56 231 and 369 (V231A/L, V236L/M, E237D, L241P, T244K/R, L257I, F261C/L/S, Y321C, C325F/R/Y, M329T, R369G/M/S). EC50 values for virus expressing these substitutions are 13- to 5,870-fold higher than those for the wild-type reference virus.\nIn Clinical Studies\n- In a Phase 2b trial evaluating letermovir or placebo in 131 HSCT recipients, DNA sequence analysis of a select region of UL56 (amino acids 231 to  was performed on samples obtained from 12 letermovir-treated subjects who experienced prophylaxis failure and for whom on-treatment samples were available for analysis. One subject had a letermovir resistance substitution, pUL56 V236M.\n- In a Phase 3 trial (P, DNA sequence analysis of the entire coding regions of UL56 and UL89 was performed on samples obtained from 28 letermovir-treated subjects who had received at least one dose of study drug and experienced prophylaxis failure and for whom samples were available for analysis. Two subjects were identified as having a letermovir-resistance substitution, pUL56 V236M or C325W. These substitutions were identified from on-treatment samples. A virus from a third subject who experienced prophylaxis failure had a pUL56 E237G substitution at low frequency (<5%), and while pUL56 E237D was associated with resistance in cell culture, the clinical significance of this substitution at this frequency is unknown.\n- Cross resistance is not likely with drugs outside of this class. Letermovir is fully active against viral populations with substitutions conferring resistance to CMV DNA polymerase inhibitors (cidofovir, foscarnet, and ganciclovir). These DNA polymerase inhibitors are fully active against viral populations with substitutions conferring resistance to letermovir.\n\n【41】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\n- Letermovir was not genotoxic in in vitro or in vivo assays, including microbial mutagenesis assays, chromosomal aberration in Chinese hamster ovary cells, and in an in vivo mouse micronucleus study.\n- Carcinogenicity studies with letermovir have not been conducted.\n- In a fertility and early embryonic development study in rats, no effects of letermovir on female fertility were observed at letermovir exposures (AUC) approximately 5 times higher than human exposure at the RHD.\n- In male rat fertility studies, decreased fertility associated with irreversible testicular toxicity was observed at ≥180 mg/kg/day (greater than or equal to 3 times the human exposure at the RHD). No fertility or testicular effects were observed at dose levels resulting in letermovir exposures (AUC) similar to human exposure at the RHD.\n- Testicular toxicity in rats observed at ≥180 mg/kg/day (greater than or equal to 3 times the human exposure at the RHD) was characterized by decreased testis weight, bilateral seminiferous tubular degeneration, decreased sperm count and motility, and resultant decreased male fertility. Male reproductive system toxicities were not observed in either a monkey testicular toxicity study up to 240 mg/kg/day (approximately 2 times higher than human exposure at the RHD), or a general toxicology study in mice up to 250 mg/kg/day (approximately 3 times higher than human exposure at the RHD).\n\n【42】 # Clinical Studies\n- To evaluate letermovir prophylaxis as a preventive strategy for CMV infection or disease in transplant recipients at high risk for CMV reactivation, the efficacy of letermovir was assessed in a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 Trial (P001, NCT in adult CMV-seropositive recipients  of an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Subjects were randomized (2: to receive either letermovir at a dose of 480 mg once daily adjusted to 240 mg when co-administered with cyclosporine, or placebo. Randomization was stratified by investigational site and risk level for CMV reactivation at the time of study entry. Study drug was initiated after HSCT (at any time from Day 0 to Day 28 post-transplant) and continued through Week 14 post-transplant. Study drug was administered either orally or intravenously; the dose of letermovir was the same regardless of the route of administration. Subjects received CMV DNA monitoring weekly until post-transplant Week 14 and then bi-weekly until post-transplant Week 24, with initiation of standard-of-care CMV pre-emptive therapy if CMV viremia was considered clinically significant. Subjects had continued follow-up through Week 48 post-transplant.\n- Among the 565 treated subjects, 70 subjects were found to have CMV viremia prior to study drug initiation and were therefore excluded from the efficacy analyses. The efficacy population consisted of 325 subjects who received letermovir (including 91 subjects who received at least one IV dose) and 170 who received placebo (including 41 subjects who received at least one IV dose). The IV formulation of letermovir was used at investigators' discretion in subjects who were unable to take oral therapy (e.g., unable to tolerate oral intake). The median time to starting study drug was 8 days after transplantation. Thirty-four percent (34%) of subjects were engrafted at baseline. The median age was 55 years (range: 18 to 76 years); 57% were male; 84% were White; 9% were Asian; 2% were Black or African American; and 7% were Hispanic or Latino.\n- At baseline, 30% of all subjects had one or more of the following factors associated with increased risk for CMV reactivation (high risk stratum): Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-related donor with at least one mismatch at one of the following three HLA-gene loci: HLA-A, -B or –DR; haploidentical donor; unrelated donor with at least one mismatch at one of the following four HLA-gene loci: HLA-A, -B, -C and -DRB1; use of umbilical cord blood as stem cell source; use of ex vivo T-cell-depleted grafts; Grade 2 or greater Graft-Versus-Host Disease (GVHD) requiring systemic corticosteroids. The remaining 70% of subjects did not meet any of these high risk stratum criteria and were therefore included in the low risk stratum. Additionally, 48% of subjects received a myeloablative regimen, 51% were receiving cyclosporine, and 43% were receiving tacrolimus. The most common primary reasons for transplant were acute myeloid leukemia (38%), myelodysplastic syndrome (16%), and lymphoma (12%).\nClinically Significant CMV Infection\n- The primary efficacy endpoint of Trial P001 was the incidence of clinically significant CMV infection through Week 24 post-transplant (prophylaxis failure). Clinically significant CMV infection was defined as the occurrence of either CMV end-organ disease, or initiation of anti-CMV pre-emptive therapy (PET) based on documented CMV viremia (using the Roche COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan assay, LLoQ is 137 IU/mL, which is approximately 150 copies/mL) and the clinical condition of the subject. The protocol-specified guidance for CMV DNA thresholds for the initiation of PET during the treatment period was ≥ 150 copies/mL or > 300 copies/mL for subjects in the high and low risk strata, respectively. From Week 14 through Week 24, the threshold was >300 copies/mL for both high and low risk strata subjects. The Non-Completer=Failure (NC=F) approach was used, where subjects who discontinued from the trial prior to Week 24 post-transplant or had a missing outcome at Week 24 post-transplant were counted as failures.\n- Efficacy results from Trial P001 are shown in \n- Efficacy results were consistent across high and low risk strata for CMV reactivation. The time to clinically significant CMV infection is shown in \n- Post-hoc analysis demonstrated that among letermovir-treated subjects, inclusion in the high risk stratum for CMV reactivation at baseline, occurrence of GVHD, and steroid use at any time after randomization may be associated with the development of clinically significant CMV infection between Week 14 and Week 24 post-transplant.\nMortality\n- The Kaplan-Meier event rate for all-cause mortality in the letermovir vs. placebo groups was 12% vs. 17% at Week 24 post-transplant, and 24% vs. 28% at Week 48 post-transplant.\n\n【43】 # How Supplied\n- Each letermovir 240 mg t is a yellow oval t; each t is debossed with \"591\" on one side and Merck logo on the other side.

The guideline updates and expands earlier federal guidance for health care providers in the 2003 Recommendations for Incorporating HIV Prevention into the Medical Care of Persons Living with HIV.  The 2014 guideline and this Summary were developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Health Resources and Services Administration, the National Institutes of Health, the American Academy of HIV Medicine, the Association of Nurses in AIDS Care, the International Association of Providers of AIDS Care, the National Minority AIDS Council, and the Urban Coalition for HIV/AIDS Prevention Services.\nA Summary for Nonclinical Providers is directed to professionals who provide individuallevel services for persons with HIV in community-based organizations or health departments operating outside of health care facilities. ‡ A Summary for Health Departments and HIV Planning Groups is directed to professionals who provide population-level services to communities affected by HIV. \n\n【2】 #  About the Summary\n\n【3】 # Who is this Summary for?\nThis Summary is for clinical providers who serve persons with HIV in health care facilities. These providers offer risk assessments, health education, counseling, screening, diagnosis, treatment, and other health-related services. They include physicians, registered nurses, advance practice nurses, physician assistants, dentists, mental health providers, pharmacists, health educators, case managers, social workers, and counselors. Some may be employees or contractors of health departments.\n\n【4】 # What does this Summary include?\n Recommendations related to 11 domains of interventions that can decrease HIV transmission by reducing the infectiousness of persons with HIV or by reducing their risk of exposing others to HIV  Examples of practical strategies to support implementation of these recommendations  A list of links to federal guidance that supports these recommendations A).\n A link to an online Resource Library of practical materials to help implement these recommendations\n\n【5】 # How to use the Summary?\nClinical providers can use this Summary  to  Learn how they and their health care facilities can promote HIV prevention with their patients with HIV  Select interventions that may be well-suited to their patients with HIV  Train staff on best practices in HIV prevention with persons with HIV\n\n【6】 # \nThe complete guideline is available at . It is directed to professionals who serve individuals or populations with HIV: clinical providers, nonclinical providers, and staff and contractors of health departments and HIV planning groups. It includes: The sequential box and numbers in the complete guideline (which is directed to several different audiences) are not identical to the sequential box and numbers in this Summary that only lists information for clinical providers).\n\n【7】 #  The Context of Prevention with Persons with HIV Background\nIndividual, social, structural, ethical, legal, and policy issues shape the lives of persons with HIV and their ability to use HIV prevention and care services and adopt HIV prevention strategies. This section makes general recommendations about these contextual issues.\nClinical providers who understand these issues are better prepared to create a sense of shared responsibility and decision making with their patients with HIV. This may include  motivating patients with HIV to adopt prevention strategies and obtain essential services  endorsing the strategy of \"treatment as prevention\" to contribute to community well-being  communicating in a sensitive, respectful, and culturally competent manner  Federal, state, and local laws and policies that regulate the following issues:  rights, responsibilities, and protections of persons with HIV regarding disclosure of their HIV-infection status and the unintentional or intentional exposure of others to HIV  provider responsibilities regarding HIV case reporting, protecting confidentiality, obtaining informed consent for HIV services, avoiding discrimination, and any requirements to inform persons about possible HIV exposure\n\n【8】 # Encourage\n inform their patients with HIV about the availability of prophylactic medications for uninfected partners that can reduce their risk of HIV acquisition.\nOther sections of this Summary address adherence to ART ; use of ART and prophylaxis by women using hormonal contraceptives and persons seeking conception ; use of ART and prophylaxis during pregnancy and the postpartum period ; and quality improvement and program evaluation .\n\n【9】 # Recommendations Box 5. Recommendations-Antiretroviral Treatment for Care and Prevention\n\n【10】 # Initiating or resuming antiretroviral treatment (ART)\n Inform all persons with HIV about the following issues regarding antiretroviral treatment (ART) (i.e., treatment with highly effective combinations of antiretroviral drugs to suppress HIV replication)  Box 5-A):\n The health benefits of early initiation of ART, including\n- improving or maintaining health when compared with later initiation of ART  b In some jurisdictions, collaboration may involve communicating with HIV surveillance programs that monitor HIV viral load levels of reported HIV cases to identify persons with suboptimal treatment response that may be due to low adherence. c The first federal guidance in A, , that is the basis for this recommendation only addresses the personal health benefits of high adherence, not the benefits of high adherence in reducing the risk of transmitting HIV to others. d Some experts recommend asking patients to answer the question, \"In the last 30 days, how good a job did you do at taking HIV medicines in the way you were supposed to?\" using a multistep scale ranging from very poor to excellent.  Other sections of this Summary address behavioral and biomedical strategies to reduce the risk of HIV transmission: linkage to and retention in care , antiretroviral treatment , ART adherence , partner services , STD services , reproductive health care , pregnancy services , and services for other medical conditions and social factors that influence HIV transmission .  describes how to improve and evaluate these interventions.\n\n【11】 # Recommendations Box 7. Recommendations-Risk Screening and Risk-reduction Interventions\n\n【12】 # Organizational-level interventions\n Establish infrastructure to support routine risk screening and brief risk-reduction interventions  Box 7-A)\n Train staff to create a trusting, supportive and nonjudgmental atmosphere that encourages persons with HIV to be honest, to voluntarily disclose sex and druguse behaviors and health information, and to ask questions\n\n【13】 # Box 7. Recommendations-Risk Screening and Risk-reduction Interventions (cont)\nIndividual-level risk screening services  Screen persons with HIV at initial and later visits (at least yearly or more frequently as needed) for these risk factors:  Box 7-B)\n Behavioral characteristics that affect their risk of exposing others to HIV (e.g., unprotected sex, sharing drug-injection equipment)\n Biologic or biomedical characteristics that affect their level of infectiousness, (e.g., use of and adherence to antiretroviral treatment (ART), viral load level, sexually transmitted disease (STD) diagnoses, pregnancy)\n Characteristics of partners that affect the partner's risk of acquiring HIV or STD, when information available (e.g., use of condoms, preexposure prophylaxis   Clinical providers can directly refer patients to health department specialists who offer voluntary, confidential services or notify patients that reporting of cases of newly diagnosed HIV to the health department may activate offering of voluntary partner services. In most jurisdictions, physicians are authorized to provide some partner services directly to patients diagnosed with HIV and to partners that these patients refer.\nIn some clinical settings, other types of providers are trained and authorized to provide selected partner services, such as eliciting partner contact information from persons with HIV.\nOther sections of this Summary address STD services for index patients and their partners ; use of nonoccupational postexposure prophylaxis (nPEP) and preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) by HIV-uninfected partners ; and quality improvement and program evaluation .\n\n【14】 # Recommendations\n\n【15】 #  Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD) Preventive Services Background\nSexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are common in persons with HIV and many do not cause obvious symptoms or signs. Five STDs may increase the risk of transmitting HIV: syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydial infection, and HSV-2 in men and women and trichomoniasis in women. STD preventive services are an essential component of HIV prevention because the diagnosis of an STD is an objective marker of unprotected sexual activity that may result in HIV transmission; certain STDs may increase plasma HIV viral load and genital HIV shedding; and STD treatment may reduce STD-related morbidity and lower the risk of HIV transmission.\nClinicians play a crucial role in STD preventive services. These include assessment of behavioral and biological factors that may increase the risk of transmitting HIV or STD; sexual risk-reduction interventions; screening asymptomatic persons for STD pathogens; physical examination, diagnostic testing of persons with STD signs or symptoms; treatment; and partner services.\nOther sections of this Summary address confidentiality and reporting of HIV and STD information and the duty to warn partners of possible HIV exposure ; screening for sexual behavior, condom use, and STD symptoms and signs ; partner services for persons with HIV and their sex partners ; and quality improvement and program evaluation .\n\n【16】 # Recommendations Box 9. Recommendations-STD Preventive Services\nAt the initial HIV-related encounter and thereafter at a frequency appropriate to setting and risk assessment results: e Pregnant women should be screened for vaginal trichomoniasis at the same frequency as nonpregnant women (i.e., at their initial HIV care visit and annually thereafter). f Characteristics of women at high risk are defined by the most recent CDC STD Treatment Guidelines.\n Inform\n\n【17】 #  Reproductive Health Care for Women and Men Background\nReproductive health care involves several essential services for adolescents and adults with HIV who are of reproductive age and wish to prevent unplanned pregnancies or reduce the risk of sexual HIV transmission when attempting conception.\nClinical providers may provide these services to individuals, HIV-concordant couples (in which both members are HIV-infected), or HIV-discordant couples (in which only one member is infected). For example, they can offer reproductive health counseling, contraceptive services, and information on special conception methods that can reduce risk of HIV transmission.\nOther sections of this Summary address methods-including use of ART-to prevent sexual or perinatal transmission of HIV during recognized pregnancies of HIV-infected women or HIV-uninfected women who have partners with HIV ; linkage to HIV medical care , general aspects of use of ART and antiretroviral prophylaxis by HIV-uninfected partners ; ART adherence ; methods to reduce sexual transmission of HIV ; services for sex partners of persons with HIV ; and quality improvement and program evaluation . Persons who do not wish to conceive  Provide education, reproductive health counseling, or make referral for contraceptive services as appropriate to provider role and setting, to women and men who wish to prevent future pregnancy  Assist persons with HIV who do not wish to conceive in making informed decisions about contraception that consider  the benefits of dual contraceptive methods (condoms plus other contraception)\n\n【18】 # Recommendations\n the high efficacy and safety profile of hormonal contraception and IUDs for women with HIV  the benefits of using water-based spermicides and condom lubricants that do not contain nonoxynol-9\n Inform women with HIV who are considering medically attended pregnancy termination that available evidence indicates that HIV infection does not increase the risk of complications after the procedure  Inform women with HIV who are using or considering using ART and hormonal contraception at the same time about possible drug interactions that might influence the efficacy of the ART or the hormonal contraception\n\n【19】 # Provide services\n Assess pregnancy status of HIV-infected women and reproductive plans of women and men with HIV, with methods and frequency as appropriate to provider role and setting (e.g., self-reported pregnancy status and/or pregnancy testing)   Special conception methods that lower, but do not eliminate, HIV transmission risk (compared with unprotected penile-vaginal intercourse), including  specifically timed, periovulatory unprotected intercourse  intravaginal or intrauterine artificial insemination, in vitro fertilization, or intracytoplasmic sperm injection using semen of an HIV-uninfected donor or specially processed (\"washed\") sperm of an HIV-infected man\n\n【20】 #  HIV Prevention Related to Pregnancy Background\n increase the risk of sexual HIV transmission from HIV-infected pregnant women to uninfected male partners as well as from HIV-infected male partners to uninfected pregnant women.\nClinical providers can offer a wide variety of prevention and care services that can prevent HIV transmission from HIV-infected women with recognized pregnancies and can prevent HIV transmission to pregnant HIV-uninfected women who have HIV-infected sex or drug injection partners.\nOther sections of this Summary address linking pregnant women to HIV medical care ; general aspects of antiretroviral treatment (ART) for persons with HIV and prophylaxis for HIV-uninfected partners ; general aspects of ART adherence ; behavioral risk-reduction interventions suited to HIV-infected partners of pregnant women ; notification of sex and drug-injection partners of pregnant women with HIV or of HIV-uninfected pregnant women ; screening pregnant women for sexually transmitted disease (STD) services ; contraception services and reproductive health counseling that can be offered after delivery ; and quality improvement and program evaluation .  Inform women and HIV-uninfected partners they refer about  the availability of preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV-uninfected partners when clinically indicated to reduce risk of HIV acquisition during unprotected sexual intercourse  the availability of nonoccupational postexposure prophylaxis (nPEP) for HIV-uninfected partners to reduce the risk of HIV acquisition in the event of inadvertent sexual or parenteral HIV exposure within the past 72 hours (e.g., unprotected intercourse, condom breakage, shared drug-injection equipment)\n\n【21】 # Recommendations\n Advise women to urge sex partners and drug-injection partners to get HIV testing and to use condoms to prevent HIV acquisition  Provide education, counseling, and/or referral for postpartum contraception services to all women who wish to prevent or delay future pregnancy, as appropriate to the setting  Inform women about options for free or subsidized ART, such as AIDS Drug Assistance Program or pharmaceutical drug assistance programs to help address financial concerns that may deter ART use  Inform women of delivery options that can reduce risk of perinatal transmission  Discuss risks and benefits of cesarean delivery and recommend scheduled cesarean delivery at 38 weeks gestation for women with suboptimal viral suppression near the time of delivery (i.e., HIV RNA levels >1000 copies/mL)\n Inform women and their partners that breastfeeding by HIV-infected women is not recommended in the United States and that formula feeding is recommended for the infants of these women.\n\n【22】 #  Services for Other Medical Conditions and Social Factors that Influence HIV Transmission Background\nA variety of special medical and social services can support persons with HIV who experience significant personal, social, and structural challenges, such as poverty, mental illness, substance use, and unshousing. These specialty services can improve health outcomes and quality of life, reduce the risk of HIV transmission, and enable the use of HIV prevention and care services (. Specialty services can hasten initiation of antiretroviral treatment (ART); support retention in HIV care and adherence to ART; and encourage persons with HIV to engage in riskreduction interventions, partner services, sexually transmitted disease services, and reproductive health services that prevent HIV transmission. Some clinical providers have the resources and expertise to offer these specialty services onsite. Other providers can link or refer persons with HIV to other specialty providers or agencies and follow up to check if the services were accessed.  of this Summary describes factors that influence the delivery of HIV prevention and care services for special populations with HIV.  describes methods to improve or evaluate specialty services for persons with HIV.\n\n【23】 # Recommendations", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

The deletion in 5q has been associated with the development of blastic natural killer cell lymphoma. Blastic natural killer cell lymphoma must be differentiated from other malignancies such as acute myeloid leukemia, human T-cell lymphotropic virus 1 associated adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, cutaneous NK/T-cell lymphoma, primary and secondary cutaneous pleomorphic T-cell lymphomas, undifferentiated carcinoma, and malignant melanoma. Blastic NK cell lymphoma is more commonly observed among middle-aged or elderly patients. The mean age at diagnosis is 66 years.Males are more commonly affected with blastic natural killer cell lymphoma than females. Prognosis is generally poor, and the median survival rate is 15 months. Symptoms of blastic natural killer cell lymphoma may include nodules, plaques and patches of variable sizes on skin. Immunohistochemical staining is positive for r CD4 and CD56, with variable positivity for CD43, TdT, and CD68. The mainstay of therapy for blastic natural killer cell lymphoma is chemotherapy with CHOP or COP-like regimens.\n\n【2】 # Historical Perspective\n- Blastic natural killer cell lymphoma was first discovered by Adachi, an American hematologist, in 1994 following an unusual presentation of cutaneous lymphoma that express CD4 and CD56 antigens but no other T cell and B cell antigens.\n- Chaperot et al demonstrated that predendritic cells (plasmacytoid monocytes) and CD4/CD56 leukemic cells are similar in the production of alpha-interferon in response to influenza virus stimulation, which on maturation with interleukin 3 (IL- become powerful inducers for CD4 proliferation and Th-2 polarization. .\n- Petrella and Karube demonstrated that CD123, which is a marker of predendritic cells, are expressed on the tumor cells in blastic natural killer cell lymphoma and proposed an oncogenic transformation of NCAM-expressing plasmacytoid monocyte-like cells as cell of origin in CD4/CD56 blastic natural killer cell lymphoma.\n\n【3】 # Pathophysiology\n- Blastic natural killer cell lymphoma is a type of lymphoma. It does not appear to be associated with Epstein Barr virus (EBV) .\n- Blastic natural killer cell lymphoma is derived from plasmacytoid type 2 dendritic cell precursors. These dendritic cell precursors are possibly related to a common myeloid/NK-cell precursor cell.\n- Blastic natural killer cell lymphoma is currently classified by World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Tumors of Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Tissues as an aggressive neoplasm derived from the precursors of plasmacytoid dendritic cells and categorically placed under the heading “Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and related precursor neoplasms.”\n- The deletion in 5q has been associated with the development of blastic natural killer cell lymphoma.\n- Other genetic abnormalities associated with blastic natural killer cell lymphoma are deletion of 12p, abnormalities of chromosome 13, deletion of 6q, and loss of chromosomes 15 and 9.\n- On hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, fine chromatin and scanty cytoplasm resembling lymphoblasts, or in some cases, myeloblasts, and may on occasion exhibit sub-membranous cytoplasmic vacuolations surrounding the nucleus are characteristic findings of blastic natural killer cell lymphoma.\n- Tumor cells are invariably CD4+ and CD56+, and usually HLA-DR and CD45RA are positive as well.\n- CD2 and CD34 are usually negative; and expression of TdT, CD7 and cytoplasmic CD3 is variable.\n- Hematoxylin & Eosin stain of skin lesion biopsy. Low power view of leukemic infiltrate corresponding to the raised plaque (A, black arrows) and high power view of the malignant cells in the skin infiltrate\n- Large malignant-appearing cells, with agranular cytoplasm, cleaved nuclei and prominent neocleoli on peripheral blood smear using Wright stain (A) and similar blast cells present in cerebrospinal fluid\n\n【4】 # Differentiating Blastic NK cell Lymphoma from other Diseases\nABBREVIATIONS\nN/A: Not available, NL: Normal, FISH: Fluorescence in situ hybridization, PCR: Polymerase chain reaction, LDH: Lactate dehydrogenase, PUD: Peptic ulcer disease, EPO: Erythropoietin, LFTs: Liver function tests, RFTs: Renal function tests, LAP: Leukocyte alkaline phosphatase, LAD: Leukocyte alkaline dehydrgenase, WBCs: White blood cells.\n\n【5】 # Epidemiology and Demographics\n- The prevalence of blastic natural killer cell lymphoma is unknown as it is an extremely rare disorder.\n\n【6】 ## Age\n- Blastic natural killer cell lymphoma is more commonly observed amongmiddle-aged or elderly patients. The mean age at diagnosis is 66 years.\n\n【7】 ## Gender\n- Males are more commonly affected with blastic natural killer cell lymphoma than females.\n\n【8】 # Natural History, Complications and Prognosis\n- The majority of patients with blastic natural killer cell lymphoma have an aggressive clinical course.\n- Prognosis is generally poor, and the median survival rate is 15 months.\n\n【9】 # Diagnosis\n\n【10】 ## Symptoms\n- Symptoms of blastic natural killer cell lymphoma may inclu\n- Nodules, plaques and patches of variable sizes on skin\n\n【11】 ## Physical Examination\n- Physical examination may be remarkable for:\n- Nodules, plaques and patches of variable sizes on skin\n\n【12】 ## Laboratory Findings\n- There are no specific laboratory findings associated with blastic natural killer cell lymphoma.\n\n【13】 ## Imaging Findings\n- There are no imaging study findings associated with blastic natural killer cell lymphoma\n\n【14】 ## Other Diagnostic Studies\n be diagnosed using immunochemistry.\n- Immunohistochemical staining is positive for r CD4 and CD56, with variable positivity for CD43, TdT, and CD68.\n\n【15】 # Treatment\n\n【16】 ## Medical Therapy\n- The mainstay of therapy for blastic NK cell lymphoma is chemotherapy with CHOP or COP-like regimens.\n being considered for chemotherapy-resistant patients.\n\n【17】 ## Prevention\n- There are no primary preventive measures available for blastic natural killer cell lymphoma.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

However there is not enough good-quality evidence to support the case for routine adoption.\nResearch in the form of a randomised controlled trial is recommended to show clinically meaningful benefits for the VAC Veraflo Therapy system (wound instillation with negative pressure therapy) compared with negative pressure wound therapy alone. A key outcome should be time to wound closure.\nWhy the committee made these recommendations\nAcute infected or chronic wounds are normally cleaned, dead or infected tissue removed, and dressed. Chronic non-healing wounds are usually treated with advanced wound care (such as adsorptive or moisture-donating advanced wound dressings). Some wounds are treated with negative pressure therapy, which uses a pump to draw out excess fluid from the wound. VAC Veraflo Therapy system would generally be considered as an alternative to negative pressure wound therapy without wound instillation.\n slowly introduces cleansing fluid onto the wound bed (wound instillation therapy). The fluid stays for a time and then is slowly drawn away from the wound, along with wound and tissue fluid. The fluid is delivered in automated treatment cycles allowing the wound to be repeatedly cleaned without needing to remove the dressing.\nThe clinical evidence for VAC Veraflo Therapy system is mostly low quality. The best available evidence does not show any clinical benefit over negative pressure wound therapy without instillation. Also, the evidence is from the US and does not reflect the way VAC Veraflo Therapy system is used in the NHS. There was not enough evidence to compare VAC Veraflo Therapy system with advanced wound care, and the comparison is of limited relevance because advanced wound care is used in a different part of the care pathway.\nAlthough there are potential benefits for patients and the NHS, more evidence is needed to be certain of VAC Veraflo Therapy system's clinical effectiveness and potential for cost savings compared with negative pressure wound therapy in the NHS. Therefore NICE recommends further research.# The technology\n\n【3】 # Technology\nVAC Veraflo Therapy system (3M+KCI) uses negative pressure wound therapy and wound instillation with topical solutions to promote wound healing. Wound instillation is a controlled process in which topical solutions are slowly introduced to the wound bed, where they remain for a defined period before being removed using negative pressure. Treatment is delivered in automated treatment cycles, allowing wounds to be repeatedly cleansed without needing to remove the dressing.VAC Veraflo Therapy system has the following components:\nVAC Ulta Therapy Unit – delivers VAC Veraflo therapy.\nExudate canister – single-patient use, disposable canister (500 ml or 1,000 ml), which collects fluid.\nVAC Veralink Cassette – instillation cassette which connects the topical wound solution container and dressing tubing to the VAC Ulta Therapy Unit.\nVAC Veraflo Dressing kit of clinician's choice (VAC Veraflo Dressing, VAC Veraflo Cleanse Dressing or VAC Veraflo Cleanse Choice Dressing). The VAC Veraflo Dressing kits include the appropriate dressing as well as VAC VeraTRAC Pad with tubing, VAC Advanced Drape, and 3M Cavilon No Sting Barrier Film.\n individually CE marked.\n\n【4】 # Innovative aspects\nVAC Veraflo Therapy system differs from other negative pressure wound therapies because it is designed to apply and remove a cleansing solution, as well as giving automated cycles of negative pressure wound therapy. The technology allows for repeated cleansing without needing to remove the dressing.\n\n【5】 # Intended use\nVAC Veraflo Therapy system is intended to be used to treat acute infected or chronic wounds that do not respond to standard care and need additional therapy to promote healing and wound closure. Clinical scenarios that result in acutely infected or chronic non-healing wounds include surgical site infections, diabetic foot ulcers, and pressure ulcers, which NICE has published recommendations and advice for.\nThe technology is used by healthcare professionals, such as surgeons, podiatrists, and tissue viability nurses, in hospital. Healthcare staff using the technology will need training, which is provided by the company.\n\n【6】 # Costs\nThe costs for VAC Veraflo Therapy system (excluding VAT) inclu\nVAC Veralink canister (average cost for 500 ml and 1,000 ml cannisters £34.\nVAC Veralink Cassette (£19.\nVAC Veraflo Dressings (average dressing cost £84.\nrental of the VAC Ulta Therapy Unit (£16 per day).It is assumed that consumables are changed 3 times a week.For more details, see the website for VAC Veraflo Therapy system.# Evidence\n\n【7】 # Clinical evidence\n\n【8】 ## The main clinical evidence comprises 19 studies\nThe evidence assessed by the external assessment centre (EAC) included 19 studies, all of which were full-text peer-reviewed publications. Of the included studies, 9 were comparative studies (3 randomised controlled trials and 6 observational studies) and 10 were single-arm observational studies. The comparative evidence included a total of 636 people, of whom 365 had VAC Veraflo Therapy system, 222 had negative pressure wound therapy, and 49 had dressings. For full details of the clinical evidence, see section 3 of the assessment report in supporting documentation.\n\n【9】 ## There are not enough data to make a meaningful comparison with advanced wound care\nOf the 19 studies included by the EAC, only 2 compared VAC Veraflo Therapy system with dressings . Both studies were retrospective, and the EAC said that their methodology and reporting were not high enough quality to have confidence in the results. The EAC concluded that there was not enough evidence to be able to assess the clinical benefit of VAC Veraflo Therapy system over advanced wound care.\n\n【10】 ## The randomised controlled trial by Kim  is the most robust evidence\nThe EAC considered the randomised controlled trial by Kim  to be the most informative study. It was in scope, made a relevant comparison (VAC Veraflo Therapy system compared with negative pressure wound therapy), had a relatively large sample size (n=183, randomised), and a relatively high methodological quality. The study included people with acute (28%) or chronic (72%) wounds of various types. These included diabetic ulcers (43%), pressure ulcers (17%) and surgical wounds (13% dehisced and 13% non-dehisced). The EAC considered the other randomised controlled trials by Yang  and Kim  to be of limited relevance.\n\n【11】 ## The observational comparative studies are generally retrospective and of limited methodological quality\nThe EAC considered all the comparative observational studies to be of poor methodological quality. It concluded that it was not possible to confidently say that the intervention caused the reported outcomes. Common weaknesses included:\npoorly reported patient selection\nsmall sample sizes\nuse of historical control groups without an adequate description of how these were selected\nlack of statistical matching\n substantial heterogeneity in study populations and wound characteristics.\n\n【12】 ## Heterogeneity in the study populations and variation in care pathways make it difficult to generalise data to the NHS\nThe comparative evidence covered a range of populations. Some studies included people with a specific wound type, while others involved a range. According to the EAC, the heterogeneous nature of the study populations, combined with the relatively small patient numbers for each wound type made interpretation of results in specific patient groups difficult. Also, none of the studies were in the NHS or reported on UK populations.\n\n【13】 ## The available evidence suggests that VAC Veraflo Therapy system reduces bacterial bioburden but the clinical significance of this is unclear\n reported a reduction in bioburden with VAC Veraflo Therapy system after 7 days of therapy. The EAC highlighted that the clinical significance of this outcome was unclear.\n\n【14】 ## It is not certain if VAC Veraflo Therapy system has better outcomes than negative pressure wound therapy\nOne randomised controlled trial reported no significant difference in its primary endpoint: the number of follow-on surgical debridements for VAC Veraflo Therapy system compared with negative pressure wound therapy . Apart from a reduction in bioburden, there was no significant difference between VAC Veraflo Therapy system and negative pressure wound therapy for any other secondary outcomes. These included the number of inpatient operating room debridements, time until wound closure or coverage, the proportion of wounds closed, and the number of wound complications. The EAC concluded that there was no evidence to support the claims for VAC Veraflo Therapy system of a reduced need for debridement or other follow-on treatments, and improvements in wound healing, compared with negative pressure wound therapy.\n\n【15】 ## The evidence to support claims of a shorter hospital stay is weak\nThere was weak evidence to suggest that VAC Veraflo Therapy system is associated with a shorter hospital stay than negative pressure wound therapy in some populations. These included people with acute wounds of the lower limb  subgroup analysis only).\n\n【16】 ## There is no published evidence on health-related quality of life or patient-reported outcome measures\nThere was no evidence on the following clinical management outcomes: number of dressing changes, number of amputations or skin grafts, staff time, and use of other consumables. There was no published evidence on health-related quality of life or patient-reported outcome measures.\n\n【17】 # Cost evidence\n\n【18】 ## The company's comparators are negative pressure wound therapy and advanced wound care in 4 clinical scenarios\n assumed that consumables needed changing 3 times per week. Nurse training time on VAC Veraflo Therapy system was believed to be negligible and was not included. The main clinical parameters driving the model related to length of hospital stay, length of therapy, and the number of surgical debridements needed. Parameters were derived from 7 comparative studies. When all 3 parameters could not be sourced from the same study, the company applied scaling factors using data from another study. The 3 sources of costs in the model were from the therapies themselves, surgical debridement and hospital stay.\n\n【19】 ## The company's estimates show cost savings over the comparators\nThe company's base case results estimated a cost saving using VAC Veraflo Therapy system of £3,251 per patient compared with negative pressure wound therapy. It was £8,312 per patient compared with advanced wound care. The main driver for these cost savings was a shorter hospital stay in the VAC Veraflo Therapy system arm. The company's sensitivity analyses reported that the technology was cost saving in all of the individual scenarios that were used to inform the base case (from £300 to over £13,. Results from a one-way deterministic sensitivity analysis found that changing individual parameters did not affect the overall direction of cost savings, but that cost savings were most sensitive to parameter or cost changes in length of stay. For full details of the cost evidence, see section 4 of the assessment report in supporting documentation.\n\n【20】 ## The overall modelling approach used by the company is not appropriate\n noted that the company had used simple averages to estimate parameters in the base case, and these had not been weighted by study sample size or by underlying prevalence. The EAC did not agree with the company's method of estimating missing clinical parameters using scaling factors based on data from different studies. The EAC believed that, because of the amount of structural and parameter uncertainty, the results from the company's sensitivity analyses were uninformative.\n\n【21】 ## There is a lack of confidence in the informing clinical data\nThe EAC noted that most of the clinical parameters used in the company model were derived from retrospective studies with low methodological quality. Some of the studies involved people who did not match the scenario described. Three of the studies used by the company were excluded by the EAC in the clinical evaluation because they used a previous version of the technology (VAC Instill).\n\n【22】 ## The EAC's changes to the model result in VAC Veraflo Therapy system costing more than negative pressure wound therapy\nThe EAC revised the company's model to address some potential limitations by:\nIncluding 2 new scenarios using relevant data from 2 additional studies . The randomised controlled trial by Kim  was regarded by the EAC as the most robust evidence and was the closest to being considered appropriate for populating parameters on clinical effectiveness.\nOnly using data reported within a single study for each scenario. In the absence of data, length of stay was assumed to be the same as length of therapy. When a study did not report the number of surgeries or debridements in both arms, no debridement costs were incurred.\nUpdating technology costs to reflect current prices and excluding additional procedural costs that the company had included for the 'prosthetic implant subgroup'.\nModifying some inputs concerning resource use and rounding techniques.The EAC's base case  found VAC Veraflo Therapy system to be more costly than negative pressure wound therapy for all cost domains (length of stay, therapy and debridement), with an overall cost difference of £480 per patient. The EAC did not report a base case for VAC Veraflo Therapy system compared with advanced wound care because there were not enough data to inform this analysis.\n\n【23】 ## It is not certain that VAC Veraflo Therapy system is cost saving\nAlthough the EAC made changes to the company model that aimed to improve accuracy and consistency, its analyses had similar limitations to the company's because there was not enough clinical evidence. The EAC's scenario analyses showed that VAC Veraflo Therapy system was cost saving in all scenarios except for the EAC base case and that cost savings were mainly from shorter hospital stay. Results from probabilistic sensitivity analyses on the base case scenario showed a point estimate cost difference of £471 (95% credible interval -£1,085 to £2,. The EAC highlighted that, because the credible interval crossed zero, it is not possible to draw conclusions from this analysis. The EAC's probabilistic sensitivity analysis at a scenario level showed that cost savings with VAC Veraflo Therapy system were highly likely in 3 out of 9 scenarios. But there was considerable uncertainty in the other 6 scenarios. Based on these results, the EAC concluded that the cost saving potential is highly uncertain.# Committee discussion\n\n【24】 # Clinical-effectiveness overview\n\n【25】 ## VAC Veraflo Therapy system shows promise but there is not enough evidence of its clinical benefits\n noted that the most robust evidence  showed no statistically significant clinical benefit for VAC Veraflo Therapy system compared with negative pressure wound therapy. The clinical experts explained that, in their experience, VAC Veraflo Therapy system has shown benefits over standard negative pressure wound therapy for appropriately selected people with difficult to heal wounds. The clinical experts said they had seen a reduction in dressing changes, faster tissue granulation, shorter wound healing time, and a shorter time to surgery. The committee felt that the technology showed promise and plausibility based on clinical expert advice, but that this was not supported by the available evidence. The committee concluded that there was not enough good-quality evidence to make a definitive judgement about the benefits of this technology compared with negative pressure wound therapy or advanced wound care in the NHS.\n\n【26】 ## Negative pressure wound therapy (without instillation) is the relevant comparator for VAC Veraflo Therapy system\n after treatment with VAC Veraflo Therapy system or negative pressure wound therapy. The committee considered negative pressure wound therapy to be the most appropriate comparator.\n\n【27】 ## The evidence is heterogenous in terms of patient population and reporting\n said that VAC Veraflo Therapy system is most commonly used in people with diabetic foot problems before limb salvage. The committee was aware that outcome reporting is particularly problematic in this field because of the heterogenous population and setting, as well as the use of non-standardised definitions and measurements. The committee concluded that the complexity of the population, together with the heterogeneity of the available evidence, makes generalisation of study results difficult.\n\n【28】 # Relevance to the NHS\n\n【29】 ## The best available evidence does not reflect NHS practice\n agreed that the care pathway evaluated in Kim  did not fully reflect their experience of using VAC Veraflo Therapy system in the NHS. The committee concluded that the evidence does not fully reflect NHS practice and that data from non-UK studies are likely to have limited generalisability to the NHS.\n\n【30】 # Outcome measures\n\n【31】 ## Length of hospital stay may not be an appropriate primary clinical outcome\n agreed that wound closure is the most important outcome. The committee concluded that the outcome of length of hospital stay may not be an appropriate primary clinical outcome.\n\n【32】 ## There is no evidence on important clinical outcomes\n explained that improving the quality of granulation tissue in the early healing stages was an important benefit of the technology that was not captured in the evidence. The committee concluded that further research would be helpful on the technology's effect on these outcomes.\n\n【33】 # Other patient benefits or issues\n\n【34】 ## VAC Veraflo Therapy system has plausible benefits for people over standard negative pressure wound therapy\nThe clinical experts said that people who are offered treatment with VAC Veraflo Therapy system have usually had a non-healing wound for months and that this is likely to have made their quality of life poorer. They explained that when people see the rapidly improved appearance of their wound, which can happen after treatment with VAC Veraflo Therapy system, it can give them much-needed hope. The experts said that in their experience people tend to accept and respond well to therapy. They said other potential benefits were fewer dressing changes, and less wound exudate, odour and spoiling of clothing and bed linen.\n\n【35】 ## VAC Veraflo Therapy system may benefit people with protected characteristics under the Equality Act\n heard, however, that people with serious mental health or cognitive impairment may have difficulty keeping the system in place. The committee concluded that people with disabilities, including those with serious mental health or cognitive impairment, would not be disadvantaged by the recommendations. This is providing that clinicians act in the interest of their patients, in line with their usual responsibilities.\n\n【36】 # NHS considerations overview\n\n【37】 ## VAC Veraflo Therapy system is intended to be used temporarily to promote wound healing\nThe clinical experts explained that in the NHS VAC Veraflo Therapy system is used as a temporary treatment at a specific point in wound healing to speed up wound healing. They explained that it's usually used for about 2 weeks and that when the wound bed improves, treatment is changed to standard negative pressure wound therapy or standard wound care with dressings. One expert explained that once a wound has a good level of granulation tissue it can be treated with conventional dressings. They said that people are routinely discharged with open wounds that are then managed in community care. The other experts noted that in their experience VAC Veraflo Therapy system is used as a bridging therapy and helps reduce the time between surgical treatments by preparing the wound bed for reconstruction.\n\n【38】 ## VAC Veraflo Therapy system should be used in hospital by specialist healthcare professionals trained in using it\nThe clinical experts said that, because of the complexity of the wounds, a multidisciplinary team, including a trust specialist trained in using VAC Veraflo Therapy system, should decide when to offer treatment with VAC Veraflo Therapy system and when to stop it. The clinical experts thought that this level of specialism was not widely available in community care. Also, using the system in community care is difficult because of the frequency of dressing and other consumable changes. The clinical experts said that it is only offered in secondary or tertiary care. One clinical expert added that offering VAC Veraflo Therapy system in a community setting should not be ruled out if appropriate support mechanisms are in place.\n\n【39】 ## A standard dwell time of 10 minutes and cycle length of 3.5 hours should be considered for VAC Veraflo Therapy system\n enables healthcare professionals to modify settings based on clinical judgement. The clinical experts noted that in their experience the standard setting of 10 minutes dwell time and a 3.5 hour cycle length recommended by the manufacturer is normally appropriate for most wounds. One said that in some situations they increase the number of cycles to every 1 hour to 2 hours at the beginning of therapy to speed up wound healing. The committee concluded the standard settings recommended by the manufacturer were appropriate.\n\n【40】 # Cost modelling overview\n\n【41】 ## Any cost modelling using the available evidence is likely to be flawed\nThe key clinical parameters that drive cost savings estimates in the economic modelling, such as surgical debridement and length of stay, were very uncertain. This is because the evidence was mainly made up of retrospective observational studies from outside the UK, and because of uncertainties in the relationship between length of stay and length of therapy. The committee noted that there were no well-designed studies in the NHS. It concluded that more research was needed to establish the clinical and cost benefits of VAC Veraflo Therapy system in the NHS and that in the meantime any cost modelling was likely to be flawed.\n\n【42】 # Further research\n\n【43】 ## Randomised controlled trials of VAC Veraflo Therapy system in the NHS are needed\n encouraged data collection from registries. It agreed that large-scale real-world data collection in the form of registries may help future decision making around the adoption of VAC Veraflo Therapy system. For example, in providing confidence in assumptions made in the economic modelling.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

An adequate response is defined as:\na 75% reduction in the PASI score (PASI  from when treatment started or\na 50% reduction in the PASI score (PASI  and a 5‑point reduction in DLQI from when treatment started.\nWhen using the PASI, healthcare professionals should take into account skin colour and how this could affect the PASI score, and make the clinical adjustments they consider appropriate.\nWhen using the DLQI, healthcare professionals should take into account any physical, psychological, sensory or learning disabilities, or communication difficulties, that could affect the responses to the DLQI and make any adjustments they consider appropriate.\nIf patients and their clinicians consider guselkumab to be one of a range of suitreatments, including ixekizumab and secukinumab, the least costly (taking into account administration costs and commercial arrangements) should be chosen.\nThis recommendation is not intended to affect treatment with guselkumab that was started in the NHS before this guidance was published. People having treatment outside this recommendation may continue without change to the funding arrangements in place for them before this guidance was published, until they and their NHS clinician consider it appropriate to stop.\nWhy the committee made these recommendations\n suggests that guselkumab is likely to provide similar health benefits to ixekizumab and secukinumab.\nFor the cost comparison, it is appropriate to compare guselkumab with ixekizumab and secukinumab. Taking into account how many people continue treatment (which affects the cost to the NHS), guselkumab provides similar health benefits to ixekizumab and secukinumab at a similar or lower cost. It is therefore recommended as an option for treating plaque psoriasis in the NHS.# Information about guselkumab\n\n【3】 # Marketing authorisation\nGuselkumab (Tremfya, Janssen) is indicated for 'the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy'.\n\n【4】 # Dosage in the marketing authorisation\nThe recommended dosage of guselkumab is 100 mg by subcutaneous injection at weeks 0 and 4, followed by a 100 mg maintenance dose every 8 weeks. Consideration should be given to stopping treatment in people whose disease has shown no response after 16 weeks of treatment.\n\n【5】 The list price of guselkumab is £2,250 per prefilled syringe (excluding VAT; British national formulary online; accessed March . The company has a commercial arrangement. This makes guselkumab available to the NHS with a discount. The size of the discount is commercial in confidence. It is the company's responsibility to let relevant NHS organisations know details of the discount.# Committee discussion\n the committee papers for full details of the evidence. The company proposed that this technology be considered in a fast track appraisal using cost-comparison methodology.\n\n【6】 # Decision problem\n\n【7】 ## The company's decision problem is relevant to clinical practice\nThe company proposed that guselkumab should be considered as an alternative to other biological therapies for psoriasis in adults when non-biological systemic treatment or phototherapy is inadequately effective, not tolerated or contraindicated. The committee understood that the company's proposed decision problem was narrower than guselkumab's marketing authorisation. However, it agreed that the proposed population was consistent with previous NICE recommendations for biologicals for psoriasis, and with their use in clinical practice. The committee noted that the company presented comparisons with NICE-recommended biologicals, and considered that this was consistent with the criteria for a cost-comparison appraisal (the appropriateness of specific comparators is discussed in section 3.. The committee recalled that previous technology appraisal guidance recommendations specified that treatment should stop if there is an inadequate response after induction. An adequate response is defined as:\na 75% reduction in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score (PASI  from when treatment started or\na 50% reduction in the PASI score (PASI  and a 5‑point reduction in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) from when treatment started.The committee considered that it would be reasonable to consider a similar approach for this appraisal. It accepted that the company's positioning reflected the likely place of guselkumab in clinical practice, and concluded that the company's decision problem was relevant to clinical practice.\n\n【8】 # Clinical effectiveness\n\n【9】 ## Guselkumab is more effective than adalimumab\nGuselkumab has been studied in 3 randomised controlled trials including a total of 2,096 adults with plaque psoriasis. It was directly compared with adalimumab in 2 trials, VOYAGE‑1 and VOYAGE‑2. In these trials, guselkumab was associated with statistically significant improvements compared with adalimumab in primary and secondary outcomes, including PASI response rates. The committee noted, in particular, that patients randomised to guselkumab were statistically significantly more likely to have a PASI 75 response after induction (that is, at week  compared with adalimumab (VOYAGE‑1: PASI 75 response rates 91.2% and 73.1% respectively, p<0.. The committee accepted that the results of the VOYAGE trials showed that guselkumab was more effective than adalimumab.\n\n【10】 ## The company's network meta-analysis is suifor decision-making\nThe company's network meta-analysis compared guselkumab with adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab, ixekizumab, secukinumab and ustekinumab, using data from 45 trials. It understood that the ERG preferred the analyses based only on comparators specified in the decision problem (termed the 'restricted analyses') because these matched the scope. The committee accepted the ERG's view and concluded that the network meta-analysis provided by the company was suifor decision-making.\n\n【11】 ## Guselkumab provides greater benefits than TNF‑alpha inhibitors and ustekinumab, and similar benefits to secukinumab and ixekizumab\n covered a range of outcomes, and that the results for PASI 100 were broadly consistent with those for PASI 75. The committee noted the safety and tolerability outcomes in the company's network meta-analysis and considered that guselkumab had a similar safety profile to other biologicals, regardless of treatment class. It concluded that guselkumab provides substantially greater clinical benefits compared with adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab and ustekinumab, and is likely to provide similar benefits to secukinumab and ixekizumab.\n\n【12】 # Cost comparison\n\n【13】 ## The committee prefers the cost-comparison analysis provided by the ERG\n took into account the long-term stopping of treatment during maintenance therapy. The committee noted the ERG's view that assuming similar effectiveness was inappropriate because of the statistically significant differences between treatments in clinical effectiveness. Therefore, the ERG presented exploratory analyses either using the company's assumption of clinical similarity, or using different treatment continuation rates for each treatment based on PASI 75 response rates from the network meta-analysis  section 3.. These exploratory analyses included all biologicals and used a 10‑year time horizon. The committee appreciated that guselkumab is statistically significantly more effective than some other subcutaneous biological treatments  section 3.. It was aware that differences in effectiveness led to differences in the number of people stopping treatment after induction, resulting in differences in treatment duration between therapies and hence differences in costs to the NHS. It considered that treatment duration should be taken into account in a cost-comparison analysis when it is directly affected by clinical effectiveness, and that when there is a difference in effectiveness between guselkumab and a comparator, different continuation rates should be used. The committee therefore concluded that the ERG's cost-comparison analysis was preferable for decision-making.\n\n【14】 ## Secukinumab and ixekizumab are the relevant comparators for cost comparison\n noted that, when a technology provides greater benefits than a comparator but at a greater cost, it is not possible to reach a conclusion using cost-comparison methods. It therefore concluded that adalimumab and ustekinumab were not accepcomparators to focus on in a cost-comparison context. Conversely, the committee recognised that, because guselkumab, ixekizumab and secukinumab are likely to provide similar clinical benefits  section 3., it was possible to reach a recommendation using cost-comparison methods by considering the comparison of guselkumab with secukinumab and ixekizumab. It noted that secukinumab has a rapidly growing market share, and that ixekizumab is expected to be used more frequently over time. The committee concluded that ixekizumab and secukinumab, not adalimumab and ustekinumab, were the relevant comparators for the cost-comparison analysis.\n\n【15】 ## Guselkumab meets the criteria to be recommended using cost comparison\nThe committee focused on the cost comparison with ixekizumab and secukinumab using the ERG's exploratory analyses  section 3. and taking into account all confidential patient access schemes. In these analyses, the total costs associated with guselkumab were similar to or lower than those associated with ixekizumab and secukinumab (the exact results cannot be reported here because the discounts are confidential). The committee concluded that the criteria for a positive cost comparison were met because:\nguselkumab provided similar overall health benefits to ixekizumab and secukinumab and\nthe total costs associated with guselkumab were similar to or lower than the total costs associated with ixekizumab and secukinumab.The committee therefore recommended guselkumab as an option for treating plaque psoriasis in adults. It concluded that the recommendations for guselkumab should be consistent with the company's proposal and the NICE recommendations for ixekizumab and secukinumab, that is:\nfor people with severe disease (a PASI of 10 or more and a DLQI of more than  and\nwhen the disease has not responded to standard systemic therapies or when these treatments are unsuiand with consideration given to stopping treatment after induction if the disease does not respond adequately.\n\n【16】 ## The PASI and DLQI may not be appropriate for all people with psoriasis\nThe committee noted, as in previous NICE technology appraisals on psoriasis, potential equality issues:\nthe PASI might underestimate disease severity in people with darker skin\nthe DLQI has limited validity in some people, and may miss anxiety and depression.The committee concluded that, when using the PASI, healthcare professionals should take into account skin colour and how this could affect the PASI score, and make the clinical adjustments they consider appropriate. Also, it concluded that, when using the DLQI, healthcare professionals should take into account any physical, psychological, sensory or learning disabilities, or communication difficulties, that could affect the responses to the DLQI and make any adjustments they consider appropriate.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

It acts through the inhibition of cell wall mucopeptide biosynthesis. Ampicillin has a broad spectrum of bactericidal activity against many gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic andanaerobic bacteria. (Ampicillin is, however, degraded by beta-lactamases, and therefore the spectrum of activity does not normally include organisms which produce these enzymes.)\nA wide range of beta-lactamases found in microorganisms resistant to penicillins and cephalosporins have been shown in biochemical studies with cell-free bacterial systems to be irreversibly inhibited by sulbactam. Although sulbactam alone possesses little useful antibacterial activity except against the Neisseriaceae, whole organism studies have shown that sulbactam restores ampicillin activity against beta-lactamase producing strains. In particular, sulbactam has good inhibitory activity against the clinically important plasmid mediated beta-lactamases most frequently responsible for transferred drug resistance. Sulbactam has no effect on the activity of ampicillin against ampicillin susceptible strains.\nThe presence of sulbactam in the ampicillin/sulbactam formulation effectively extends the antibiotic spectrum of ampicillin to include many bacteria normally resistant to it and to other beta-lactam antibiotics. Thus, ampicillin/sulbactam possesses the properties of a broad-spectrum antibiotic and a beta-lactamase inhibitor.\n\n【2】 # Susceptible Microorganisms\n- Staphylococcus aureus (beta-lactamase and non-beta-lactamase producing)\n- Staphylococcus epidermidis (beta-lactamase and non-beta-lactamase producing)\n- Staphylococcus saprophyticus (beta-lactamase and non-beta-lactamase producing)\n- Streptococcus faecalis (Enterococcus)\n- Streptococcus pneumoniae (formerly D. pneumoniae)\n- Streptococcus pyogenes\n- Streptococcus viridans\n- Escherichia coli (beta-lactamase and non-beta-lactamase producing)\n- Hemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase and non-beta-lactamase producing)\n- Klebsiella species (all known strains are beta-lactamase producing)\n- Moraxella catarrhalis (beta-lactamase and non-beta-lactamase producing)\n- Morganella morganii\n- Neisseria gonorrhoeae (beta-lactamase and non-beta-lactamase producing)\n- Proteus mirabilis (beta-lactamase and non-beta-lactamase producing)\n- Proteus vulgaris\n- Providencia rettgeri\n- Providencia stuartii\n- Bacteroides species, including B. fragilis\n- Clostridium species\n- Peptococcus species\n- Peptostreptococcus species\n These are not beta-lactamase producing strains and, therefore, are susceptible to ampicillin alone.\n\n【3】 # Susceptibility Testing\nFor the disk diffusion method of susceptibility testing, a 20 mcg (10 mcg ampicillin + 10 mcg sulbactam) disk should be used. The standardized procedure requires the use of a standardized inoculum concentration. With this procedure, a report from the laboratory of \"Susceptible\" indicates that the infecting organism is likely to respond to UNASYN therapy and a report of \"Resistant\" indicates that the infecting organism is not likely to respond to therapy. An \"Intermediate\" susceptibility report suggests that the infecting organism would be susceptible to UNASYN if a higher dosage is used or if the infection is confined to tissues or fluids (e.g., urine) in which high antibiotic levels are attained.\nBroth, agar, microdilution or equivalent methods may be used to determine the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) value for susceptibility of bacterial isolates using standardized methods, inoculums and concentrations of ampicillin/sulbactam.\nThe recommended dilution method employs a constant ampicillin/sulbactam ratio of 2:1 in all tubes with increasing concentrations of ampicillin. MIC's are reported in terms of ampicillin concentration in the presence of sulbactam at a constant 2 parts ampicillin to 1 part sulbactam.\n- The non-beta-lactamase producing organisms which are normally susceptible to ampicillin, such as Streptococci, will have similar zone sizes as for ampicillin disks.\n Staphylococci resistant to methicillin, oxacillin, or nafcillin must be considered resistant to UNASYN.\n‡ The quality control cultures should have the following assigned daily ranges for ampicillin/sulbactam.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "182ea8e9-b13b-4e60-ad25-39064e64c160", "title": null, "text": "【0】 Tree rearrangement\nTree rearrangements are used in heuristic algorithms devoted to searching for an optimal tree structure. They can be applied to any set of data that are naturally arranged into a tree, but have most applications in computational phylogenetics, especially in maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood searches of phylogenetic trees, which seek to identify one among many possible trees that best explains the evolutionary history of a particular gene or species.\n\n【1】 # Basic tree rearrangements\nThe simplest tree-rearrangement, known as nearest-neighbor interchange, exchanges the connectivity of four subtrees within the main tree. Because there are three possible ways of connecting four subtrees, and one is the original connectivity, each interchange creates two new trees. Exhaustively searching the possible nearest-neighbors for each possible set of subtrees is the slowest but most optimizing way of performing this search. An alternative, more wide-ranging search, subtree pruning and regrafting (SPR), selects and removes a subtree from the main tree and reinserts it elsewhere on the main tree to create a new node. Finally, tree bisection and reconnection (TBR) detaches a subtree from the main tree at an interior node and then attempts all possible connections between branches of the two trees thus created. The increasing complexity of the tree rearrangement technique correlates with increasing computational time required for the search, although not necessarily with their performance.\n\n【2】 # Tree fusion\nThe simplest type of tree fusion begins with two trees already identified as near-optimal; thus, they most likely have the majority of their nodes correct but may fail to resolve individual tree \"leaves\" properly; for example, the separation ((A,B),(C,D)) at a branch tip versus ((A,C),(B,D)) may be unresolved. Tree fusion swaps these two solutions between two otherwise near-optimal trees. Variants of the method use standard genetic algorithms with a defined objective function to swap high-scoring subtrees into main trees that are high-scoring overall.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

The dosage should subsequently be titrated (as described above) to the optimal response.\n- Special notice: Concomitant administration of Mavik with potassium supplements, potassium salt substitutes, or potassium sparing diuretics can lead to increases of serum potassium.\n\n【2】 ## Heart Failure Post Myocardial Infarction or Left-Ventricular Dysfunction Post Myocardial Infarction\n- Dosing information\n- Recommended starting dosage: 1 mg PO qd\n- Followed-by: 4 mg PO qd (If a 4 mg dose is not tolerated, patients can continue therapy with the greatest tolerated dose.)\n\n【3】 ## Dosage Adjustment in Renal Impairment or Hepatic Cirrhosis\n- Dosing information\n- Initial dosage: 0.5 mg/day and have their dosage titrated to the optimal response.\n\n【4】 ## Acute ST segment elevation myocardial infarction\n- Developed by: American College of Cardiology Foundation (ACCF) and American Heart Association (AHA)\n- Class of Recommendation: Class IIa\n- Strength of Evidence: Level A\n- Dosing Information/Recommendation\n- Test dosageL: 0.5 mg/kg ; titrate up to 4 mg/day  as tolerated.\n\n【5】 ## Prophylaxis treatment of Cardiovascular event risk\n- Dosing information\n- 4 mg/day\n- Dosing information\n- 2-4 mg/day\n- 1 mg/day\n- 2 mg/day\n- Dosing information\n- 1 mg PO qd-3 mg PO bid \n- Do not co-administer aliskiren with Mavik in patients with diabetes\n- Presumably because angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors affect the metabolism of eicosanoids and polypeptides, including endogenous bradykinin, patients receiving ACE inhibitors, including Mavik, may be subject to a variety of adverse reactions, some of them serious.\n\n【6】 ## Anaphylactoid Reactions During Desensitization\n- Two patients undergoing desensitizing treatment with hymenoptera venom while receiving ACE inhibitors sustained life-threatening anaphylactoid reactions. In the same patients, these reactions did not occur when ACE inhibitors were temporarily withheld, but they reappeared when the ACE inhibitors were inadvertently readministered.\n\n【7】 ## Anaphylactoid Reactions During Membrane Exposure\n been reported in patients undergoing low-density lipoprotein apheresis with dextran sulfate absorption.\n\n【8】 ## Head and Neck Angioedema\n- In controlled trials ACE inhibitors (for which adequate data are available) cause a higher rate of angioedema in black than in non-black patients.\n- Angioedema of the face, extremities, lips, tongue, glottis, and larynx has been reported in patients treated with ACE inhibitors including Mavik. Symptoms suggestive of angioedema or facial edema occurred in 0.13% of Mavik-treated patients. Two of the four cases were life-threatening and resolved without treatment or with medication (corticosteroids). Angioedema associated with laryngeal edema can be fatal. If laryngeal stridor or angioedema of the face, tongue or glottis occurs, treatment with Mavik should be discontinued immediately, the patient treated in accordance with accepted medical care and carefully observed until the swelling disappears. In instances where swelling is confined to the face and lips, the condition generally resolves without treatment; antihistamines may be useful in relieving symptoms. Where there is involvement of the tongue, glottis, or larynx, likely to cause airway obstruction, emergency therapy, including but not limited to subcutaneous epinephrine solution 1:1,000 (0.3 to 0.5 mL) should be promptly administered.\n\n【9】 ## Intestinal Angioedema\n- Intestinal angioedema has been reported in patients treated with ACE inhibitors. These patients presented with abdominal pain (with or without nausea or vomiting); in some cases there was no prior history of facial angioedema and C-1 esterase levels were normal. The angioedema was diagnosed by procedures including abdominal CT scan or ultrasound, or at surgery, and symptoms resolved after stopping the ACE inhibitor. Intestinal angioedema should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients on ACE inhibitors presenting with abdominal pain.\n\n【10】 ## Hypotension\n- Mavik can cause symptomatic hypotension. Like other ACE inhibitors, Mavik has only rarely been associated with symptomatic hypotension in uncomplicated hypertensive patients. Symptomatic hypotension is most likely to occur in patients who have been salt- or volume-depleted as a result of prolonged treatment with diuretics, dietary salt restriction, dialysis, diarrhea, or vomiting. Volume and/or salt depletion should be corrected before initiating treatment with Mavik. In controlled and uncontrolled studies, hypotension was reported as an adverse event in 0.6% of patients and led to discontinuations in 0.1% of patients.\n be taken in patients with ischemic heart disease, aortic stenosis, or cerebrovascular disease.\n- If symptomatic hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in the supine position and, if necessary, normal saline may be administered intravenously. A transient hypotensive response is not a contraindication to further doses; however, lower doses of Mavik or reduced concomitant diuretic therapy should be considered.\n\n【11】 ## Neutropenia/Agranulocytosis\n have a collagen-vascular disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus or scleroderma. Available data from clinical trials of trandolapril are insufficient to show that trandolapril does not cause agranulocytosis at similar rates. As with other ACE inhibitors, periodic monitoring of white blood cell counts in patients with collagen-vascular disease and/or renal disease should be considered.\n\n【12】 ## Hepatic Failure\n- ACE inhibitors rarely have been associated with a syndrome of cholestatic jaundice, fulminant hepatic necrosis, and death. The mechanism of this syndrome is not understood. Patients receiving ACE inhibitors who develop jaundice should discontinue the ACE inhibitor and receive appropriate medical follow-up.\n\n【13】 ## Fetal Toxicity\n\n【14】 ## Pregnancy Category D\n- Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue Mavik as soon as possible. These adverse outcomes are usually associated with use of these drugs in the second and third trimester of pregnancy. Most epidemiologic studies examining fetal abnormalities after exposure to antihypertensive use in the first trimester have not distinguished drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system from other antihypertensive agents. Appropriate management of maternal hypertension during pregnancy is important to optimize outcomes for both mother and fetus.\n- In the unusual case that there is no appropriate alternative to therapy with drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system for a particular patient, apprise the mother of the potential risk to the fetus. Perform serial ultrasound examinations to assess the intra-amniotic environment. If oligohydramnios is observed, discontinue Mavik, unless it is considered lifesaving for the mother. Fetal testing may be appropriate, based on the week of pregnancy. Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury. Closely observe infants with histories of in utero exposure to Mavik for hypotension, oliguria, and hyperkalemia.\n- Doses of 0.8 mg/kg/day (9.4 mg/m2/day) in rabbits, 1000 mg/kg/day (7000 mg/m2/day) in rats, and 25 mg/kg/day (295 mg/m2/day) in cynomolgus monkeys did not produce teratogenic effects. These doses represent 10 and 3 times (rabbits), 1250 and 2564 times (rats), and 312 and 108 times (monkeys) the maximum projected human dose of 4 mg based on body-weight and body-surface-area, respectively assuming a 50 kg woman.\n\n【15】 ## Precautions\n\n【16】 ## General\n\n【17】 ## Impaired Renal Function\n- As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals. In patients with severe heart failure whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, treatment with ACE inhibitors, including Mavik (trandolapril), may be associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and rarely with acute renal failure and/or death.\n- In hypertensive patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine have been observed in some patients following ACE inhibitor therapy. These increases were almost always reversible upon discontinuation of the ACE inhibitor and/or diuretic therapy. In such patients, renal function should be monitored during the first few weeks of therapy.\n- Some hypertensive patients with no apparent preexisting renal vascular disease have developed increases in blood urea and serum creatinine, usually minor and transient, especially when ACE inhibitors have been given concomitantly with a diuretic. This is more likely to occur in patients with preexisting renal impairment. Dosage reduction and/or discontinuation of any diuretic and/or the ACE inhibitor may be required. Evaluation of hypertensive patients should always include assessment of renal function.\n\n【18】 ## Hyperkalemia and Potassium-sparing Diuretics\n- In clinical trials, hyperkalemia (serum potassium > 6.00 mEq/L) occurred in approximately 0.4% of hypertensive patients receiving Mavik. In most cases, elevated serum potassium levels were isolated values, which resolved despite continued therapy. None of these patients were discontinued from the trials because of hyperkalemia. Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia include renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, and the concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, and/or potassium-containing salt substitutes, which should be used cautiously, if at all, with Mavik.\n\n【19】 ## Cough\n- Presumably due to the inhibition of the degradation of endogenous bradykinin, persistent nonproductive cough has been reported with all ACE inhibitors, always resolving after discontinuation of therapy. ACE inhibitor-induced cough should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cough. In controlled trials of trandolapril, cough was present in 2% of trandolapril patients and 0% of patients given placebo. There was no evidence of a relationship to dose.\n\n【20】 ## Surgery/Anesthesia\n- In patients undergoing major surgery or during anesthesia with agents that produce hypotension, Mavik will block angiotensin II formation secondary to compensatory renin release. If hypotension occurs and is considered to be due to this mechanism, it can be corrected by volume expansion.\n- Headache and fatigue were all seen in more than 1% of Mavik-treated patients but were more frequently seen on placebo. Adverse events were not usually persistent or difficult to manage.\n\n【21】 ## Left Ventricular Dysfunction Post Myocardial Infarction\n- Adverse reactions related to Mavik occurring at a rate greater than that observed in placebo-treated patients with left ventricular dysfunction, are shown below. The incidences represent the experiences from the TRACE study. The follow-up time was between 24 and 50 months for this study.\n- Clinical adverse experiences possibly or probably related or of uncertain relationship to therapy occurring in 0.3% to 1.0% (except as noted) of the patients treated with Mavik (with or without concomitant calcium ion antagonist or diuretic) in controlled or uncontrolled trials (N= and less frequent, clinically significant events seen in clinical trials or post-marketing experience include (listed by body system):\n\n【22】 ## General Body Function\n- Chest pain.\n\n【23】 ## Cardiovascular\n- AV first degree block, bradycardia, edema, flushing, and palpitations.\n\n【24】 ## Central Nervous System\n- Drowsiness, insomnia, paresthesia, vertigo.\n\n【25】 ## Dermatologic\n- Pruritus, rash, pemphigus.\n\n【26】 ## Eye, Ear, Nose, Throat\n- Epistaxis, throat inflammation, upper respiratory tract infection.\n\n【27】 ## Emotional, Mental, Sexual States\n- Anxiety, impotence, decreased libido.\n\n【28】 ## Gastrointestinal\n- Abdominal distention, abdominal pain/cramps, constipation, dyspepsia, diarrhea, vomiting, nausea.\n\n【29】 ## Hemopoietic\n- Decreased leukocytes, decreased neutrophils.\n\n【30】 ## Metabolism and Endocrine\n- Increased liver enzymes including SGPT (ALT).\n\n【31】 ## Musculoskeletal System\n- Extremity pain, muscle cramps, gout.\n\n【32】 ## Pulmonary\n- Dyspnea.\n\n【33】 ## Postmarketing\n- The following adverse reactions were identified during post approval use of Mavik. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.\n\n【34】 ## General Body Function\n- Malaise, fever.\n\n【35】 ## Cardiovascular\n- Myocardial infarction, myocardial ischemia, angina pectoris, cardiac failure, ventricular tachycardia, tachycardia, transient ischemic attack, arrhythmia.\n\n【36】 ## Central Nervous System\n- Cerebral hemorrhage.\n\n【37】 ## Dermatologic\n- Alopecia, sweating, Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis.\n\n【38】 ## Emotional, Mental, Sexual States\n- Hallucination, depression.\n\n【39】 ## Gastrointestinal\n- Dry mouth, pancreatitis, jaundice and hepatitis.\n\n【40】 ## Hemopoietic\n- Agranulocytosis, pancytopenia.\n\n【41】 ## Metabolism and Endocrine\n- Increased SGOT (AST).\n\n【42】 ## Pulmonary\n- Bronchitis.\n\n【43】 ## Renal and Urinary\n- Renal failure.\n\n【44】 ## Clinical Laboratory Test Findings\n\n【45】 ## Hematology\nThrombocytopenia.\n\n【46】 ## Serum Electrolytes\n- Hyponatremia.\n\n【47】 ## Creatinine and Blood Urea Nitrogen\n- Increases in creatinine levels occurred in 1.1% of patients receiving Mavik alone and 7.3% of patients treated with Mavik, a calcium ion antagonist and a diuretic. Increases in blood urea nitrogen levels occurred in 0.6% of patients receiving Mavik alone and 1.4% of patients receiving Mavik, a calcium ion antagonist, and a diuretic. None of these increases required discontinuation of treatment. Increases in these laboratory values are more likely to occur in patients with renal insufficiency or those pretreated with a diuretic and, based on experience with other ACE inhibitors, would be expected to be especially likely in patients with renal artery stenosis.\n\n【48】 ## Liver Function Tests\n- Occasional elevation of transaminases at the rate of 3X upper normals occurred in 0.8% of patients and persistent increase in bilirubin occurred in 0.2% of patients. Discontinuation for elevated liver enzymes occurred in 0.2% of patients.\n\n【49】 ## Other\n- Another potentially important adverse experience, eosinophilic pneumonitis, has been attributed to other ACE inhibitors.\n- Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on Mavik and other agents that affect the RAS.\n- Do not co-administer aliskiren with Mavik in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with Mavik in patients with renal impairment (GFR <60 ml/min).\n\n【50】 ## Concomitant Diuretic Therapy\n- As with other ACE inhibitors, patients on diuretics, especially those on recently instituted diuretic therapy, may experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of therapy with Mavik. The possibility of exacerbation of hypotensive effects with Mavik may be minimized by either discontinuing the diuretic or cautiously increasing salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with Mavik. If it is not possible to discontinue the diuretic, the starting dose of trandolapril should be reduced.\n\n【51】 ## Agents Increasing Serum Potassium\n- Trandolapril can attenuate potassium loss caused by thiazide diuretics and increase serum potassium when used alone. Use of potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone, triamterene, or amiloride), potassium supplements, or potassium-containing salt substitutes concomitantly with ACE inhibitors can increase the risk of hyperkalemia. If concomitant use of such agents is indicated, they should be used with caution and with appropriate monitoring of serum potassium.\n\n【52】 ## Antidiabetic Agents\n- Concomitant use of ACE inhibitors and antidiabetic medicines (insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents) may cause an increased blood glucose lowering effect with greater risk of hypoglycemia.\n\n【53】 ## Lithium\n used, the risk of lithium toxicity may be increased.\n\n【54】 ## Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors)\n- In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with ACE inhibitors, including trandolapril, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving trandolapril and NSAID therapy.\n- The antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors, including trandolapril may be attenuated by NSAIDs.\n\n【55】 ## Gold\n- Nitritoid reactions (symptoms include facial flushing, nausea, vomiting and hypotension) have been reported rarely in patients on therapy with injecgold (sodium aurothiomalate) and concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy including Mavik.\n\n【56】 ## Other\n- No clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction has been found between trandolaprilat and food, cimetidine, digoxin, or furosemide.\n- The anticoagulant effect of warfarin was not significantly changed by trandolapril.\n- The hypotensive effect of certain inhalation anesthetics may be enhanced by ACE inhibitors including trandolapril\n- In the unusual case that there is no appropriate alternative to therapy with drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system for a particular patient, apprise the mother of the potential risk to the fetus. Perform serial ultrasound examinations to assess the intra-amniotic environment. If oligohydramnios is observed, discontinue Mavik, unless it is considered lifesaving for the mother. Fetal testing may be appropriate, based on the week of pregnancy. Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury. Closely observe infants with histories of in utero exposure to Mavik for hypotension, oliguria, and hyperkalemia.\n- Doses of 0.8 mg/kg/day (9.4 mg/m2/day) in rabbits, 1000 mg/kg/day (7000 mg/m2/day) in rats, and 25 mg/kg/day (295 mg/m2/day) in cynomolgus monkeys did not produce teratogenic effects. These doses represent 10 and 3 times (rabbits), 1250 and 2564 times (rats), and 312 and 108 times (monkeys) the maximum projected human dose of 4 mg based on body-weight and body-surface-area, respectively assuming a 50 kg woman.\n- Trandolapril pharmacokinetics have been investigated in the elderly (> 65 years) and in both genders. The plasma concentration of trandolapril is increased in elderly hypertensive patients, but the plasma concentration of trandolaprilat and inhibition of ACE activity are similar in elderly and young hypertensive patients. The pharmacokinetics of trandolapril and trandolaprilat and inhibition of ACE activity are similar in male and female elderly hypertensive patients.\n- The recommended initial dosage of Mavik for patients not receiving a diuretic is 1 mg once daily in non-black patients and 2 mg in black patients. Dosage should be adjusted according to the blood pressure response. Generally, dosage adjustments should be made at intervals of at least 1 week. Most patients have required dosages of 2 to 4 mg once daily. There is little clinical experience with doses above 8 mg.\n- Patients inadequately treated with once-daily dosing at 4 mg may be treated with twice-daily dosing. If blood pressure is not adequately controlled with Mavik monotherapy, a diuretic may be added.\n- In patients who are currently being treated with a diuretic, symptomatic hypotension occasionally can occur following the initial dose of Mavik. To reduce the likelihood of hypotension, the diuretic should, if possible, be discontinued two to three days prior to beginning therapy with Mavik. Then, if blood pressure is not controlled with Mavik alone, diuretic therapy should be resumed. If the diuretic cannot be discontinued, an initial dose of 0.5 mg Mavik should be used with careful medical supervision for several hours until blood pressure has stabilized. The dosage should subsequently be titrated (as described above) to the optimal response.\n- Concomitant administration of Mavik with potassium supplements, potassium salt substitutes, or potassium sparing diuretics can lead to increases of serum potassium.\n- The recommended starting dose is 1 mg, once daily. Following the initial dose, all patients should be titrated (as tolerated) toward a target dose of 4 mg, once daily. If a 4 mg dose is not tolerated, patients can continue therapy with the greatest tolerated dose.\n- For patients with a creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min. or with hepatic cirrhosis, the recommended starting dose, based on clinical and pharmacokinetic data, is 0.5 mg daily. Patients should subsequently have their dosage titrated (as described above) to the optimal response.\n- Laboratory determinations of serum levels of trandolapril and its metabolites are not widely available, and such determinations have, in any event, no established role in the management of trandolapril overdose. No data are available to suggest that physiological maneuvers (e.g., maneuvers to change the pH of the urine) might accelerate elimination of trandolapril and its metabolites. Trandolaprilat is removed by hemodialysis. Angiotensin II could presumably serve as a specific antagonist antidote in the setting of trandolapril overdose, but angiotensin II is essentially unavailable outside of scattered research facilities. Because the hypotensive effect of trandolapril is achieved through vasodilation and effective hypovolemia, it is reasonable to treat trandolapril overdose by infusion of normal saline solution.\n- ACE is identical to kininase II, an enzyme that degrades bradykinin, a potent peptide vasodilator; whether increased levels of bradykinin play a role in the therapeutic effect of trandolapril remains to be elucidated.\n- While the principal mechanism of antihypertensive effect is thought to be through the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, trandolapril exerts antihypertensive actions even in patients with low-renin hypertension. Mavik was an effective antihypertensive in all races studied. Both black patients (usually a predominantly low-renin group) and non-black patients responded to 2 to 4 mg of Mavik.\n- M.W. = 430.54\n- Melting Point = 125°C\n contains corn starch, croscarmellose sodium, hypromellose, iron oxide, lactose monohydrate, povidone, sodium stearyl fumarate.\n\n【57】 # Metabolism and Excretion\n- After oral administration of trandolapril, about 33% of parent drug and metabolites are recovered in urine, mostly as trandolaprilat, with about 66% in feces. The extent of the absorbed dose which is biliary excreted has not been determined. Plasma concentrations (Cmax and AUC of trandolapril and Cmax of trandolaprilat) are dose proportional over the 1-4 mg range, but the AUC of trandolaprilat is somewhat less than dose proportional. In addition to trandolaprilat, at least 7 other metabolites have been found, principally glucuronides or deesterification products.\n- Serum protein binding of trandolapril is about 80%, and is independent of concentration. Binding of trandolaprilat is concentration-dependent, varying from 65% at 1000 ng/mL to 94% at 0.1 ng/mL, indicating saturation of binding with increasing concentration.\n- The volume of distribution of trandolapril is about 18 liters. Total plasma clearances of trandolapril and trandolaprilat after approximately 2 mg IV doses are about 52 liters/hour and 7 liters/hour respectively. Renal clearance of trandolaprilat varies from 1-4 liters/hour, depending on dose.\n- Long-term studies were conducted with oral trandolapril administered by gavage to mice (78 weeks) and rats (104 and 106 weeks). No evidence of carcinogenic potential was seen in mice dosed up to 25 mg/kg/day (85 mg/m2/day) or rats dosed up to 8 mg/kg/day (60 mg/m2/day). These doses are 313 and 32 times (mice), and 100 and 23 times (rats) the maximum recommended human daily dose (MRHDD) of 4 mg based on body-weight and body-surface-area, respectively assuming a 50 kg individual. The genotoxic potential of trandolapril was evaluated in the microbial mutagenicity (Ames) test, the point mutation and chromosome aberration assays in Chinese hamster V79 cells, and the micronucleus test in mice. There was no evidence of mutagenic or clastogenic potential in these in vitro and in vivo assays.\n- Reproduction studies in rats did not show any impairment of fertility at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day (710 mg/m2/day) of trandolapril, or 1250 and 260 times the MRHDD on the basis of body-weight and body-surface-area, respectively.\n- A single 2-mg dose of Mavik produces 70 to 85% inhibition of plasma ACE activity at 4 hours with about 10% decline at 24 hours and about half the effect manifest at 8 days. Maximum ACE inhibition is achieved with a plasma trandolaprilat concentration of 2 ng/mL. ACE inhibition is a function of trandolaprilat concentration, not trandolapril concentration. The effect of trandolapril on exogenous angiotensin I was not measured.\n\n【58】 ## Hypertension\n- Four placebo-controlled dose response studies were conducted using once-daily oral dosing of Mavik in doses from 0.25 to 16 mg per day in 827 black and non-black patients with mild to moderate hypertension. The minimal effective once-daily dose was 1 mg in non-black patients and 2 mg in black patients. Further decreases in trough supine diastolic blood pressure were obtained in non-black patients with higher doses, and no further response was seen with doses above 4 mg (up to 16 mg). The antihypertensive effect diminished somewhat at the end of the dosing interval, but trough/peak ratios are well above 50% for all effective doses. There was a slightly greater effect on the diastolic pressure, but no difference on systolic pressure with b.i.d. dosing. During chronic therapy, the maximum reduction in blood pressure with any dose is achieved within one week. Following 6 weeks of monotherapy in placebo-controlled trials in patients with mild to moderate hypertension, once-daily doses of 2 to 4 mg lowered supine or standing systolic/diastolic blood pressure 24 hours after dosing by an average 7-10/4-5 mmHg below placebo responses in non-black patients. Once-daily doses of 2 to 4 mg lowered blood pressure 4-6/3-4 mmHg in black patients. Trough to peak ratios for effective doses ranged from 0.5 to 0.9. There were no differences in response between men and women, but responses were somewhat greater in patients under 60 than in patients over 60 years old. Abrupt withdrawal of Mavik has not been associated with a rapid increase in blood pressure.\n- Administration of Mavik to patients with mild to moderate hypertension results in a reduction of supine, sitting and standing blood pressure to about the same extent without compensatory tachycardia.\n- Symptomatic hypotension is infrequent, although it can occur in patients who are salt- and/or volume-depleted. Use of Mavik in combination with thiazide diuretics gives a blood pressure lowering effect greater than that seen with either agent alone, and the additional effect of trandolapril is similar to the effect of monotherapy.\n\n【59】 ## Heart Failure Post Myocardial Infarction or Left Ventricular Dysfunction Post Myocardial Infarction\n associated with a 20% reduction in the risk of progression of heart failure (p=0., defined by a time-to-first-event analysis of death attributed to heart failure, hospitalization for heart failure, or requirement for open-label ACE inhibitor for the treatment of heart failure. There was no significant effect of treatment on other end-points: subsequent hospitalization, incidence of recurrent myocardial infarction, exercise tolerance, ventricular function, ventricular dimensions, or NYHA class.\n- The population in TRACE was entirely Caucasian and had less usage than would be typical in a U.S. population of other post-infarction interventions: 42% thrombolysis, 16% beta-adrenergic blockade, and 6.7% PTCA or CABG during the entire period of follow-up. Blood pressure control, especially in the placebo group, was poor: 47 to 53% of patients randomized to placebo and 32 to 40% of patients randomized to trandolapril had blood pressures > 140/95 at 90-day follow-up visits.\n- 1 mg t - Salmon colored, round shaped, scored, compressed ts, with the “a” logo on one side and code identification letters FT on the other side.

Patients should be so advised and told to report immediately any signs or symptoms suggesting angioedema (swelling of face, extremities, eyes, lips, tongue, difficulty in swallowing or breathing) and to stop taking the drug until they have consulted with their physician.\n- Symptomatic Hypotension\n- Patients should be cautioned that light-headedness can occur, especially during the first days of Mavik therapy, and should be reported to a physician. If actual syncope occurs, patients should be told to stop taking the drug until they have consulted with their physician.\nAll patients should be cautioned that inadequate fluid intake, excessive perspiration, diarrhea, or vomiting, resulting in reduced fluid volume, may precipitate an excessive fall in blood pressure with the same consequences of light-headedness and possible syncope.\nPatients planning to undergo any surgery and/or anesthesia should be told to inform their physician that they are taking an ACE inhibitor that has a long duration of action.\n- Hyperkalemia\n- Patients should be told not to use potassium supplements or salt substitutes containing potassium without consulting their physician.\n- Neutropenia\n- Patients should be told to report promptly any indication of infection (e.g., sore throat, fever) which could be a sign of neutropenia.\n- Pregnancy\n- Female patients of childbearing age should be told about the consequences of exposure to Mavik during pregnancy. Discuss treatment options with women planning to become pregnant. Patients should be asked to report pregnancies to their physicians as soon as possible.\nNOTE: As with many other drugs, certain advice to patients being treated with Mavik is warranted.

It works by blocking the enzyme reverse transcriptase, which is responsible for hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication. Tenofovir disoproxil has a marketing authorisation in the UK for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in adults with compensated liver disease, with evidence of active viral replication, persistently elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and histological evidence of active inflammation and/or fibrosis.\nAdverse events associated with the use of nucleotide analogues include lactic acidosis and progression of hepatomegaly.

The optimal treatment duration is currently unknown. Costs may vary in different settings because of negotiated procurement discounts.# The manufacturer's submission\nThe Appraisal Committee (appendix A) considered evidence submitted by the manufacturer of tenofovir disoproxil and a review of this submission by the Evidence Review Group (ERG; appendix B).\nThe manufacturer approached the decision problem by comparing tenofovir disoproxil monotherapy with lamivudine, adefovir dipivoxil and entecavir in adults with compensated liver disease and active chronic hepatitis B (that is, evidence of viral replication and active liver inflammation). The manufacturer did not compare tenofovir disoproxil with any of the interferons. The primary outcome measures outlined in the decision problem were virological response (hepatitis B virus  DNA), histological improvement (inflammation and fibrosis), biochemical response (for example, ALT levels), and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B 'e' antigen (HBeAg) seroconversion rate.\nThe manufacturer's submission presented evidence on the clinical effectiveness of tenofovir disoproxil from two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared tenofovir disoproxil with adefovir dipivoxil. The protocol for both studies specified that the populations would be people who had not previously received nucleotide analogue therapy, although prior experience of the nucleoside analogues lamivudine or emtricitabine was allowed in the study of people with HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B. One trial compared tenofovir disoproxil with adefovir dipivoxil in people with HBeAg-positive hepatitis B (176 participants received tenofovir disoproxil and 90 adefovir dipivoxil); the other made the same comparison in people with HBeAg-negative disease (250 participants received tenofovir disoproxil and 125 adefovir dipivoxil).\nThe results of the two RCTs showed that at 48 weeks tenofovir disoproxil gave a greater proportion of complete responses (that is, histological response and HBV DNA below 400 copies/ml) than adefovir dipivoxil in people with HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative disease. The difference was statistically significant (p  0.001, in both trials). A similar proportion of people with HBeAg-positive disease had seroconversion or HBeAg loss with tenofovir disoproxil and adefovir dipivoxil, but significantly more people treated with tenofovir disoproxil had hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) loss at 48 weeks (3.2% versus 0.0%, p = 0.. No people with HBeAg-negative disease in either treatment group had experienced HBsAg loss or seroconverted to anti-HBs at 48 weeks.\nBoth RCTs reported a smaller proportion of people with HBV mutation-conserved site changes (suggestive of a potential for future resistance) with tenofovir disoproxil than with adefovir dipivoxil at 48 weeks. There were no cases of substitution in the HBV polymerase/reverse transcriptase associated with resistance to tenofovir disoproxil in either study. There were no cases of viral resistance.\nThe incidence of severe, life-threatening or disabling adverse events was similar between treatment groups, with no deaths reported in either study. However, more participants had at least one treatment-related adverse event in the tenofovir disoproxil treatment group in one study (30.7% versus 16.7%, p = 0.; the manufacturer attributed this to a higher incidence of 'mild nausea'. The incidence of arthralgia was higher for the group receiving tenofovir disoproxil in the other study (6.0% versus 0.0%, p = 0..\nThe manufacturer pointed out that there were no trials that included all treatment options in any of the patient populations and therefore a series of mixed-treatment comparison meta-analyses were carried out to assess the relative efficacy of adefovir dipivoxil, entecavir, lamivudine, tenofovir disoproxil and placebo in nucleoside-naive and lamivudine-refractory patients. For HBeAg-positive disease, the included outcomes were the probability of achieving HBV DNA suppression (< 300 copies/ml), and the probability of HBeAg seroconversion over 1 year of treatment. All analyses were conducted using random-effects models unless the between-studies standard deviation was close to zero. For HBeAg-positive nucleoside- and nucleotide-naive participants, the mixed-treatment comparison showed that tenofovir disoproxil had a statistically significantly higher predicted probability of HBV DNA suppression than all comparators. There was no statistically significant difference between the antiviral drugs for the probability of seroconversion.\nFor HBeAg-negative disease, the manufacturer explained that no meaningful analysis could be undertaken because of the small number of trials identified. The manufacturer undertook an additional analysis combining trials investigating patients with HbeAg-positive disease and those with HbeAg-negative disease. In this additional analysis, the proportion of participants who were HBeAg positive was considered as a covariate. The results for HbeAg-negative participants were similar to those seen in the HBeAg-positive subgroup in terms of the probability of achieving HBV DNA suppression (< 300 copies/ml). The manufacturer pooled data from the RCTs and the observational studies identified while undertaking the systematic review in order to obtain and compare estimates of resistance for available treatments for HBeAg-positive treatment-naive and lamivudine-refractory patients. The results suggested a low risk of viral resistance with tenofovir disoproxil in both treatment-naive and lamivudine-refractory patients and there were no cases of resistance with up to 2 years of use.\nThe manufacturer submitted a cost-effectiveness analysis using a Markov model that could be applied either to a cohort of people with HBeAg-positive or HBeAg-negative disease at the start of treatment. The model had 11 main states defined as: active chronic hepatitis B (HBV DNA ≥ 300 copies/ml), viral suppression (HBV DNA < 300 copies/ml), HBeAg seroconverted (not applicable to HBeAg-negative disease), HBsAg seroconverted, compensated cirrhosis with detecHBV DNA, compensated cirrhosis with undetecHBV DNA, decompensated cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, liver transplantation (year in which transplantation occurs), post liver transplantation and death. These were based on health states used in previous economic evaluations. The model was designed to compare tenofovir disoproxil, adefovir dipivoxil, lamivudine and entecavir. It incorporated sequences of first-, second- and third-line treatments and people were assumed to move on to the next treatment regimen if they developed resistance to their current treatment. For people with HBeAg-positive disease and those with HBeAg-negative disease the model has a lifetime horizon, a cycle length of 1 year, and patients are assumed to continue to receive an antiviral regimen until they die, undergo HBeAg seroconversion, undergo HBsAg seroconversion, or develop resistance, at which stage they would switch to an alternative regimen.\nIn the base-case manufacturer's economic analysis, after treatment sequences that were dominated or extendedly dominated were excluded, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of interest in HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B were as follows:\nlamivudine as first-line treatment followed by tenofovir disoproxil had an ICER of £6014 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) relative to lamivudine followed by best supportive care\ntenofovir disoproxil as first-line treatment followed by lamivudine had an ICER of £9940 per QALY relative to lamivudine followed by tenofovir disoproxil\ntenofovir disoproxil as first-line treatment followed by the combination of tenofovir disoproxil and lamivudine had an ICER of £13,619 per QALY relative to tenofovir disoproxil followed by lamivudine\ntenofovir disoproxil as first-line treatment followed by the combination of tenofovir and lamivudine followed by entecavir had an ICER of £36,583 per QALY relative to tenofovir disoproxil followed by tenofovir disoproxil plus lamivudine.\nIn the base-case manufacturer's economic analysis, after treatment sequences that were dominated or extendedly dominated were excluded, ICERs of interest in HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B were as follows:\ntenofovir disoproxil as first-line treatment followed by lamivudine had an ICER of £9811 per QALY relative to best supportive care\ntenofovir disoproxil as first-line treatment followed by the combination of tenofovir and lamivudine had an ICER of £13,854 per QALY relative to tenofovir disoproxil followed by lamivudine alone\ntenofovir disoproxil as first-line treatment followed by the combination of tenofovir and lamivudine followed by entecavir had an ICER of £20,781 per QALY relative to tenofovir disoproxil followed by tenofovir disoproxil plus lamivudine.\n presented results for an analysis in a cohort in which lamivudine resistance had developed:\ntenofovir disoproxil alone as treatment for lamivudine-refractory HBeAg-positive disease had an ICER of £7707 per QALY relative to best supportive care\ntenofovir disoproxil alone as treatment for lamivudine-refractory HBeAg-negative disease had an ICER of £11,078 per QALY relative to best supportive care.\nThe ERG viewed the mixed-treatment comparison methodology to be generally sound, but pointed out that it was weakened by the small number of studies (as low as 1 in some networks), a lack of quality assessment of included studies, no discussion of potential clinical heterogeneity and limited discussion of statistical heterogeneity. Therefore the ERG concluded that the results should be treated with caution.\nThe ERG viewed the pooled analysis of resistance in the manufacturer's submission as appropriate, but pointed out that data for long-term resistance (more than 2 years) are currently unavailable.\nThe ERG pointed out that there were a number of analytical errors in the manufacturer's electronic model and therefore re-ran the model with discount factors for future health effects applied to all of the model cycles, amendments to transition matrices and a once-only application of a reduction of excess mortality for patients with compensated cirrhosis achieving viral suppression. The results for people with HBeAg-positive disease gave an ICER for first-line tenofovir disoproxil followed by lamivudine relative to lamivudine followed by tenofovir disoproxil of £17,590. The ICER for tenofovir disoproxil followed by lamivudine plus tenofovir disoproxil relative to first-line tenofovir disoproxil followed by lamivudine was £27,479. The results for people with HBeAg-negative disease gave an ICER for first-line tenofovir disoproxil followed by lamivudine relative to lamivudine followed by tenofovir disoproxil of £17,640. The ICER for tenofovir disoproxil followed by lamivudine plus tenofovir disoproxil relative to first-line tenofovir disoproxil followed by lamivudine was £28,324.\nFull details of all the evidence are in the manufacturer's submission and the ERG report.# Consideration of the evidence\n mindful of the need to take account of the effective use of NHS resources.\n mindful of the long-term risk of progression to cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma associated with chronic hepatitis B infection, and the impact of this in terms of costs, mortality and health-related quality of life.\nThe Committee considered the treatment options available for patients with chronic hepatitis B in the UK. The Committee discussed the relevance of previous NICE guidance on chronic hepatitis B and where in the treatment pathway tenofovir disoproxil should be considered. The Committee understood that tenofovir disoproxil could be considered an alternative to other antiviral drugs as primary first-line therapy if an interferon is considered inappropriate (because of a contraindication or intolerance) or as second-line therapy when either a course of an interferon has not brought about seroconversion, or resistance has developed to another antiviral drug.\n took into account the ERG's remarks on the quality of the analysis of the mixed-treatment comparison. However, the Committee agreed that the identified weaknesses in the analysis were not sufficiently serious to prevent it making a decision on the use of tenofovir disoproxil in chronic hepatitis B in the light of the evidence available from the individual RCTs.\n noted that the results of the probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed a 60% and 58% probability that first-line therapy with tenofovir disoproxil is the most cost-effective antiviral strategy for treatment of HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative disease at a willingness to pay threshold of £20,000 per QALY. The Committee noted that the effectiveness estimates used in the economic model were taken from the mixed-treatment comparison and that concern had been expressed about this comparison. However, the Committee was satisfied that the effectiveness of tenofovir disoproxil was at least comparable to that of other currently recommended options, notably entecavir, and that the acquisition cost of tenofovir disoproxil was lower. Therefore the Committee concluded that tenofovir disoproxil is a cost-effective option for the treatment of HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B.\n noted that the estimates of resistance rates for tenofovir disoproxil and other antiviral drugs used in the cost-effectiveness analysis were based on a pooled analysis of resistance data undertaken by the manufacturer. Taking into account the ERG's comments and the clinical expert views on the biological plausibility of the findings, the Committee agreed that tenofovir disoproxil had a similar or more favourable resistance profile at 1 year compared with other available treatments for chronic hepatitis B. However, the Committee agreed that given the data available it could not be assumed that this low rate of resistance would be maintained in the long term.\n heard that data on long-term resistance would be needed to guide decisions on whether combination therapy should be given, and these data are presently unavailable. However, the Committee noted comments from the consultees that there may be circumstances in which combination therapy might be appropriate (for example, tenofovir disoproxil could be added to another drug as rescue therapy when resistance to the first drug has developed). Although acknowledging that evidence on the long-term clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of combination therapy was lacking, the Committee agreed that using tenofovir disoproxil in combination regimens might be accepwhen evidence supporting its clinical effectiveness becomes available. The Committee concluded that the available evidence only supported the use of tenofovir disoproxil as monotherapy, but it accepted that there may be exceptional circumstances in which tenofovir disoproxil might be used in combination with other antiviral agents. Therefore in recommending tenofovir disoproxil as an option for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B, the Committee did not specify that the treatment should be restricted absolutely to use as monotherapy, but noted that this was the approach that was supported by the evidence.# Recommendations for further research\nA phase III trial of entecavir plus tenofovir disoproxil combination therapy versus entecavir monotherapy in treatment-naive people with chronic hepatitis B is currently recruiting participants.\nResearch on the long-term risk of resistance with tenofovir disoproxil monotherapy and tenofovir disoproxil in combination with other antiviral agents is needed because few RCTs are currently available.# Related NICE guidance\nEntecavir for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B.

Hawleyite has the sphalerite (zinc blende) structure.\nSynthetic cadmium pigments based on cadmium sulfide are valued for their good thermal stability in many polymers, for example in engineering plastics.  By adding selenium in its formula its possible to obtain colors ranging from a greenish yellow to red violet pigment.  The weather resistance for this pigment is 8 in full tone, which means that it is a good pigment for UV.\nCadmium sulfide is a direct bandgap semiconductor with a bandgap of 2.42 eV.  It has useful properties for optoelectronics, being used in both photosensitive and photovoltaic devices. One simple use is as a photoresistor whose electrical resistance changes with incident light levels.\nMixed with zinc sulfide, cadmium sulfide acts as a phosphor with long afterglow.\nCadmium sulfide was used as a pigment in paints as far back as 1819, although it wasn't big on any market until the mid-nineteenth century because of how rare the substance is.  Most cadmium sulfide used in paints is manufactured in laboratories through chemical means in modern times.\nPainters like Claude Monet liked this pigment because it had a nice, cool shade of yellow, good for outdoor-type paintings.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

CoCl2 is blue, and CoCl2·6H2O is deep magenta.  Because of this dramatic color change and the ease of the hydration/dehydration reaction, \"cobalt chloride\" is used as an indicator for water. The magenta hexahydrate is probably the most familiar cobalt compound in the laboratory.\nAqueous solutions of both CoCl2 and the hydrate contain the species trans-.  This is maintained in the solid state by the hexahydrate, the remaining two water molecules in its formula unit being water of crystallization. This species dissolves readily in water and alcohol. It has the interesting property that a concentrated aqueous solution is red at room temperature, but becomes blue when heated. CoCl2·6H2O is deliquescent and the anhydrous salt CoCl2 is hygroscopic, readily converting to the hydrate.\n\n【2】 # Chemical properties\nCoCl2·6H2O and CoCl2 are weak Lewis acids that convert to many other complexes.\nThese cobalt (II) complexes are usually either octahedral or tetrahedral.  Examples inclu\nOtherwise, aqueous solutions of cobalt(II) chlorides behave like other cobalt(II) salts, such as precipitating CoS upon treatment with H2S.\n\n【3】 ## Co(III) derivatives\nIn the presence of  ammonia or amines, cobalt(II) is readily oxidised by atmospheric oxygen to give a variety of cobalt(III) complexes. For example:\nThe reaction is often performed in the presence of charcoal as a catalyst, or hydrogen peroxide is employed in place of air. Other highly basic ligands including carbonate, acetylacetonate, and oxalate induce the formation of Co(III) derivatives. Simple carboxylates and halides do not.\nUnlike Co(II) complexes, Co(III) complexes are very slow to exchange ligands, so they are said to be kinetically inert.  The German chemist Alfred Werner was awarded the Nobel prize in 1913 for his studies on a series of these cobalt(III) compounds, work that led to an understanding of the structures of such coordination compounds.\n\n【4】 ## Instability of CoCl3\n that the naked cation Co3+ would oxidize chloride to chlorine, precluding the formation of CoCl3.  Stated differently, CoCl2 is unreactive toward Cl2.  This analysis changes considerably in the presence of ligands of  Lewis basicity superior to chloride's, such as amines.\n\n【5】 # Preparation\nCobalt(II) chloride can be prepared in its anhydrous form from cobalt metal and chlorine gas:\nThe hydrated form can be prepared from cobalt(II) hydroxide or cobalt(II) carbonate and hydrochloric acid.\n\n【6】 # Uses\nA common use for cobalt(II) chloride is for the detection of moisture, for example in drying agents such as silica gel. In the US calcium sulfate is sold as a drying agent under the trade name Drierite.  When cobalt(II) chloride is added as an indicator, the drying agent is blue when still active, pink when exhausted, corresponding to the anhydrous and hydrated forms of CoCl2 respectively. Similarly, paper impregnated with cobalt chloride, known as \"cobalt chloride paper\" is likewise used to detect the presence of water.\nIn the laboratory, cobalt(II) chloride serves as a standard precursor for the synthesis of other cobalt compounds.  For example, the reaction of 1-norbonyllithium with CoCl2 produces a brown, thermally scobalt(IV) tetralkyl — the only compound of its kind for which the detailed structure is fully known:\nReaction of anhydrous CoCl2 with sodium cyclopentadienylide in THF gives the black sandwich compound cobaltocene. This 19-electron species is a good reducing agent, being readily oxidised to the yellow 18-electron cobaltacenium cation, which is isoelectronic with ferrocene.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Among children, the prevalence of stunting has been used as an indicator of zinc deficiency .\nIn pregnancy, zinc deficiency has been linked to prolonged labour, postpartum haemorrhage, pre-eclampsia, preterm birth and post-term pregnancies ; however, these associations have not been well established. This evidence-to-decision (EtD) framework presents research evidence on the effects and other considerations relevant to recommendations on antenatal zinc supplements compared with no zinc supplements or placebo.\n\n【1】 # The updated recommendation in the context of the WHO antenatal care guideline\nIn 2016, the following recommendation on antenatal zinc supplementation was ma\n\n【2】 # Rationale and objectives\nAs part of the WHO's normative work on supporting evidence-informed policies and practices and its living guidelines approach , the Department of Sexual and Reproductive Health and Research (SHR), the Department of Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health and Ageing (MCA) and the Department of Nutrition and Food Safety (NFS) prioritized the updating of this recommendation on zinc supplements following the advice of the Executive Guideline Steering Group (GSG) in response to the identification of updated evidence on this intervention.\n\n【3】 # Target audience\nThe recommendation in this global guideline is intended to inform the development of relevant national and local health policies and clinical protocols. Therefore, the target audience of this guideline includes national and local public health policy-makers, implementers and managers of national and local maternal and child health programmes, concerned nongovernmental and other organizations, professional societies involved in the planning and management of maternal and child health services, health professionals (including obstetricians, midwives, nurses, nutritionists and general medical practitioners), researchers, and academic staff involved in training health professionals.\n\n【4】 # Scope of the recommendations\nThis updated recommendation is relevant to all pregnant women and adolescent girls receiving ANC in any health-care facility or community-based setting and to their fetuses and newborns. The guideline question was prioritized during the WHO 2016 ANC guideline development process. In 2019, the recommendation was prioritized for updating in the context of WHO's living guideline commitment . The outcomes of interests are, therefore, the same as those prioritized for the ANC guideline relevant to nutritional interventions (Box .\nThis recommendation is an update of one of 49 recommendations that were published in WHO recommendations on antenatal care for a positive pregnancy experience . The recommendation was developed initially using the standardized operating procedures described in the WHO handbook for guideline development . In summary, the process included: (i) identification of priority question and outcomes, (ii) retrieval of evidence, (iii) assessment and synthesis of the evidence, (iv) formulation of recommendation, and (v) planning for the implementation, dissemination, impact evaluation and updating of the recommendation. This recommendation was identified by the Executive GSG as a high priority for updating in response to new evidence on this question.\n\n【5】 # Contributors to the guideline Executive Guideline Steering Group\nThe Executive GSG is an independent panel of external experts and relevant stakeholders from the six WHO regions. This group advises WHO on the prioritization of new and existing questions in maternal and perinatal health for recommendation development or updating.\n\n【6】 # WHO Steering Group\nThe WHO Steering Group that managed the updating process comprised the same staff members from the Departments of SRH, MCA and NFS as the WHO ANC guideline of 2016  Annex 1 for the list of members).\nThe WHO Steering Group drafted the priority question in PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcome) format and identified individuals to be invited to participate as guideline methodologists, and in the guideline development and external review groups. In addition, the WHO Steering Group supervised the evidence retrieval and synthesis, organized the technical consultation and finalized the guideline document. Additionally, WHO regional office representatives for sexual and reproductive health were invited to all GDG sessions and provided comments on the updated recommendation document. The WHO Steering Group in collaboration with WHO regional offices will oversee the dissemination of the updated recommendation.\n\n【7】 # Guideline Development Group\n served in the GDG for the WHO ANC guideline's nutrition recommendations of 2016. They were a diverse group of individuals with expertise in research, guideline development methods and clinical policy and programmes relating to ANC interventions, plus a patient/consumer representative. The GDG appraised the evidence used to inform the recommendation, advised on the interpretation of this evidence and formulated the final recommendation during an online GDG meeting on 13 January 2021. In addition, GDG members reviewed and approved the final guideline document before its submission to the WHO Guidelines Review Committee for approval. A list of the GDG members can be found in Annex 1.\n\n【8】 # External Review Group\nThe External Review Group (ERG) was a geographically and gender-balanced group with no important conflicts of interest  Annex . There were four members, including technical experts and other stakeholders with interests in the provision of evidence-informed ANC. This group peer-reviewed the draft version of the guideline document to identify any factual errors and comment on the clarity of the language, contextual issues and implications for implementation. The group ensured that the guideline decision-making processes had considered and incorporated the contextual values and preferences of people affected by the recommendation, including pregnant women and adolescent girls, health-care professionals and policy-makers. It was not within the ERG's remit to change the recommendation formulated by the GDG.\n\n【9】 # Systematic review team and guideline methodologists\nThe managing editors of the Cochrane pregnancy and childbirth group coordinated the updating of the quantitative systematic review and facilitated collaboration between systematic review authors and guideline methodologists. Working closely with the WHO Steering Group, methodologists from The Evidence-based Medicine Consultancy in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland appraised the quantitative evidence using WHO's standardized operating procedures for GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) methodology . Two qualitative-evidence experts from the University of Central Lancashire in the United Kingdom systematically reviewed qualitative studies related to women's and health professionals' views on ANC, and synthesized this evidence.\n\n【10】 # External partners and observers\nSix representatives of the ICM, UNFPA, USAID, UNICEF and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation were invited to the final GDG meeting to serve as observers. All these organizations are potential implementers of the proposed guideline with a history of collaboration with the WHO in guideline dissemination and implementation.\nObservers do not participate in the formulation of recommendations.\n\n【11】 # Declaration of interests by external contributors\nWHO requires that experts serving in an advisory role disclose any circumstances that could give rise to actual or ostensible conflicts of interest. In accordance with the WHO guidelines for declaration of interests (WHO Experts) , all GDG members and other external collaborators were asked to declare in writing any competing interests (whether academic, financial or other) at the time of the invitation to participate in the ANC guideline development process. The standard WHO form for declaration of interest (DOI) was completed and signed by each expert. The WHO Steering Group reviewed all the DOI forms before finalizing experts' invitations to participate. Where any conflicts of interest were declared, the WHO Steering Group determined whether they were serious enough to affect the individual's ability to make objective judgements about the evidence or recommendation. To ensure consistency, the WHO Steering Group applied the criteria for assessing the severity of a conflict of interest in the WHO handbook for guideline development .\nAll findings from DOI statements were managed in accordance with the WHO DOI guidelines on a case-bycase basis and communicated to the experts. Where a conflict of interest was not considered significant enough to pose any risk to the guideline development process or reduce its credibility, the expert was only required to declare such a conflict at the GDG meeting, and no further action was taken. A summary of the DOI statements and information on how conflicts of interest were managed are included in Annex 2. To strengthen public trust and transparency in connection with WHO meetings involving the provision of expert advice in developing technical norms and standards, the names and brief biographies of individuals considered for participation in this guideline together, with a description of the objectives of relevant meetings, were made public ahead of the planned online GDG meeting, to allow time for public notice and comment.\n\n【12】 # Identifying priority questions and outcomes\nThe priority question and outcomes were aligned with those of the ANC guideline. This question and outcomes were originally informed through an extensive scoping exercise of existing clinical practice guidelines relevant to routine ANC, supplemented by searching the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for existing key systematic reviews relevant to ANC. Critical and important outcomes were informed by these reviews, and by a WHO-commissioned scoping qualitative review of what women want during pregnancy . The findings of the latter revealed that pregnant women want a positive pregnancy experience, defined as maintaining physical and sociocultural normality; maintaining a healthy pregnancy and baby; having an effective transition to positive labour and birth; and achieving a positive motherhood. This composite outcome of a positive pregnancy experience became the overarching principle of ANC guideline recommendations.\n\n【13】 # Evidence identification and retrieval\nEvidence to support this recommendation was derived from a number of sources by the methodologists working closely with the WHO Steering Group. An updated systematic review was the primary source of evidence on the effectiveness of oral antenatal zinc supplementation. Earlier versions of this review -in which evidence on effectiveness was derived from randomized controlled trial (RCT) data assessed and synthesized using standardized Cochrane methodology -supported the ANC guideline recommendation of 2016. The up-to-date RevMan file was retrieved from the Cochrane pregnancy and childbirth group and customized to reflect the key comparisons, GDG-specified subgroup analyses, and outcomes relevant to the ANC guideline. Evidence was evaluated according to standard operating procedures approved by the WHO Steering Group, and evidence profiles (in the form of GRADE s) were prepared, including assessments of the certainty of the evidence, for the comparisons of interest.\nTwo qualitative systematic reviews commissioned by the WHO Steering Group for the 2016 guideline development process informed the values, acceptability and feasibility criteria of the EtD frameworks to inform the recommendation  below for more information, under section 2.6 -Preparation of the evidence summary) . Additionally, systematic reviews of cost-effectiveness were sought through PubMed searches of the literature.\n\n【14】 # Quality assessment and grading of the evidence\nThe GRADE approach  was used to appraise the certainty of quantitative evidence, meaning that the certainty of evidence for each outcome was rated as \"high\", \"moderate\", \"low\", or \"very low\" based on a set of established criteria. As a baseline, the evidence from the systematic reviews was rated \"high certainty\" because it was derived from RCTs; this rating was then downgraded according to considerations of risk of bias, inconsistency, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias or other considerations.\nQualitative evidence was derived from a qualitative evidence synthesis performed for the WHO 2016 ANC guideline .\n\n【15】 # Preparation of the evidence summary\nThe WHO Steering Group supervised and finalized the preparation of the evidence summary and profile, in collaboration with the guideline methodologists, using the DECIDE (Developing and Evaluating Communication strategies to Support Informed Decisions and Practice based on Evidence) framework. DECIDE is an EtD tool that includes explicit and systematic consideration of research evidence on interventions according to six criteria, namely effects, values, resources, equity, acceptability and feasibility . These six EtD criteria were populated with the research evidence, where available; in addition, information from other sources was described in the additional considerations subsections of each criterion. The certainty of the graded evidence on intervention effectiveness was systematically interpreted in EtD frameworks according to guidance from the Cochrane group on effective practice and organization of care .\n\n【16】 # Formulation of the recommendation\nGDG members and other participants were provided with the evidence summary in advance of the online GDG meeting held on 13 January 2021, organized by the WHO Steering Group from Geneva, Switzerland. During the technical consultation, under the leadership of the GDG chair, the GDG members reviewed, discussed and made judgements on the impact of the intervention for each of the EtD criteria. GDG judgements were summarized in a , before finalizing the recommendation and remarks. The intervention could be recommended, not recommended, or recommended only under certain conditions (in specific contexts, with targeted monitoring and evaluation, in the context of rigorous research).\n\n【17】 # Decision-making process\nThe online GDG meeting was guided by a clear protocol, designed to allow the recommendation to be formulated through a process of group discussion, until consensus was reached. The final adoption of the recommendation and, if necessary, the context in which the recommendation would apply were confirmed by unanimous consensus (i.e. full agreement among all GDG members).\n\n【18】 # Guideline preparation and peer review\nFollowing the online GDG meeting, members of the WHO Steering Group, assisted by methodologists, drafted a full guideline document to accurately reflect the deliberations and decisions of participants. A preliminary version of the document was sent electronically to the participants and the ERG for final review and technical comments.\nThe WHO Steering Group carefully evaluated the input of the peer reviewers for inclusion in the guideline document and made revisions to the guideline draft as needed. After the GDG meetings and peer review process, further modifications to the guideline by the WHO Steering Group were limited to corrections of factual errors and improvements in language to address any lack of clarity. The document was then submitted for executive clearance according to established WHO publication procedures.\n\n【19】 # Evidence and recommendation on antenatal zinc supplementation\nThis section provides the WHO recommendation adopted by the GDG on antenatal zinc supplementation with its corresponding evidence summary. Evidence on the effectiveness of zinc supplementation is further detailed in GRADE s in Annex 3. To ensure that the recommendation is correctly understood, additional remarks reflecting the summary of the discussion by the GDG are included below the recommendation.\n\n【20】 # WHO recommendation on antenatal zinc supplementation\nZinc supplementation for pregnant women is recommended only in the context of rigorous research.\n- This Guideline Development Group agreed to retain the WHO recommendation found in the 2016 WHO antenatal care guideline . - WHO does not recommend zinc supplementation as part of routine antenatal care. It is recommended only in the context of rigorous research to improve our knowledge of its effect on maternal and newborn health outcomes.\nResearch is particularly needed on how zinc status is impacted by other nutritional supplementation (e.g. iron and/or calcium) given as part of routine antenatal care. Additionally, research is needed on the efficacy of zinc supplementation -provided either alone or with other nutritional supplements (e.g. iron, folic acid and calcium, according to national guidelines/standard of care) -on maternal and neonatal outcomes. Multiple doses of zinc, iron and/or calcium may need to be evaluated based on the current national standard of care. Research on the effectiveness or the implementation of zinc supplementation is not identified as a priority at this time. - Pregnant women should be encouraged and supported to receive adequate nutrition, which is best achieved through a healthy, balanced diet, and to refer to guidelines on healthy eating .\n\n【21】 # The priority question\nFor pregnant women (population), does zinc supplementation (intervention) compared with no zinc supplementation (comparator) improve maternal and perinatal health outcomes (outcome)?\n\n【22】 # Effects of the intervention\nWhat are the anticipated effects of antenatal zinc supplements compared with no zinc supplements (or placebo)?\n\n【23】 # Research evidence\n varied across trials (before conception in one trial, in the first or second trimester in most trials, after 26 weeks' gestation in two trials, and up to 6 months postpartum in one trial), as did compliance with treatment.\n\n【24】 # Maternal outcomes\nPre-eclampsia: The evidence suggests that zinc supplementation may make little or no difference to preeclampsia compared with no zinc supplements (six trials, 2568 women; risk ratio, RR, 0.93, 95% confidence interval, CI, 0.62 to 1.42; low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to design limitations and imprecision).\n\n【25】 # Maternal infection:\nThe evidence suggests that zinc supplementation may make little or no difference to maternal infection compared with no zinc supplements (four trials, 1891 women; RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.23; low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to design limitations and imprecision).\nSide-effects: Side-effects were not generally reported in trials.\nThe evidence on caesarean section was of very low certainty and there were no relevant data on maternal anaemia, maternal mortality, gestational diabetes mellitus or positive pregnancy experience.\n\n【26】 # Fetal/neonatal outcomes\nSmall for gestational age: Zinc supplementation probably makes little or no difference to the small for gestational age outcome compared with no zinc supplements (nine trials, 5330 babies; RR, 1.02, 95% confidence interval, CI, 0.92 to 1.12; moderate-certainty evidence, downgraded due to design limitations).\n\n【27】 # Summary of effects\nLow-certainty evidence suggests that zinc supplementation may have little or no effect on pre-eclampsia and maternal infections; there is insufficient evidence available for other maternal outcomes. In addition, lowcertainty evidence suggests that supplementation may have little or no effect on any of the important fetal and neonatal outcomes.\n\n【28】 # Additional considerations\n- WHO recommends iron and folic acid supplementation containing 30 mg to 60 mg of iron and 0.4 mg of folic acid for all pregnant women, and calcium supplementation for women with low dietary intake and those at risk of pre-eclampsia; these supplements may potentially reduce the bioavailability of zinc .\n\n【29】 # Desirable effects\nHow substantial are the desirable anticipated effects of zinc supplements compared with no zinc supplements?\nJudgement  Don't know  Varies  Trivial  Small  Moderate  Large\nRationale for judgement: There appears to be no clear improvement in pregnancy outcomes.\n\n【30】 # Undesirable effects\nHow substantial are the undesirable anticipated effects of zinc supplements compared with no zinc supplements?\nJudgement  Don't know  Varies  Trivial  Small  Moderate  Large\nRationale for judgement: There was no evidence suggesting harm but adverse events were generally not reported in the studies.\n\n【31】 # Certainty of the evidence\n\n【32】 # What is the overall certainty of the evidence of effects of zinc supplements compared with no zinc supplements?\n No included studies  Very low  Low  Moderate  High\nRationale for judgement: Low certainty was the most common GRADE rating.\n\n【33】 # Is there important uncertainty about, or variability in, how much women (and their families) value the main outcomes associated with zinc supplements?\nA scoping review of what women want from ANC informed the outcomes for the WHO ANC guideline . Evidence showed that women from various resource settings valued having a positive pregnancy experience comprising three equally important components, namely effective clinical practices (interventions and tests), relevant and timely information, and psychosocial and emotional support, each provided by practitioners with good clinical and interpersonal skills within a well-functioning health system (high confidence in the evidence). Rationale for judgement: The low-certainty evidence suggests that there are neither benefits nor harms with zinc supplements.\nHow large are the resource requirements (costs)?\n\n【34】 # Research evidence\nNo research evidence on the costs and cost-effectiveness of implementing zinc supplementation was found.\n\n【35】 # Main resource requirements\n have cost implications.\n\n【36】 # Additional considerations\n- The cost-effectiveness of zinc supplements for pregnant women is uncertain because the systematic review found no strong evidence of their effectiveness in relation to the pregnancy outcomes evaluated. - To have an impact on child mortality, it has been suggested that food fortification may be the most cost-effective strategy to supplement zinc among populations with a high prevalence of zinc deficiency .\n\n【37】  required\n\n【38】 # Large savings\nRationale for judgement: The cost of zinc supplements is similar to that of iron and folic acid supplements, and, if implemented, may double the cost of micronutrient supplements provided to women during pregnancy.\n\n【39】 # Certainty of evidence on required resources\nWhat is the certainty of the evidence on costs? Rationale for judgement: The evidence did not show zinc supplementation to be effective, so cost-effectiveness cannot be evaluated.\nWhat would be the impact of zinc supplements compared with no zinc supplements on health equity?\n\n【40】 # Research evidence\n\n【41】 # Additional considerations\n- Nutritional deficiencies are common in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs).

In addition, in a number of LMIC settings, providers felt that a lack of resources, both in terms of the availability of recommended supplements and the lack of suitably trained staff to deliver nutritional information, was an issue, which may limit the implementation of this intervention (high confidence in the evidence).\n\n【46】 # Additional considerations\n- On the demand side, if zinc supplements are free and available, routine supplementation may be feasible. On the supply side, however, there may be several considerations to take into account, such as changes in regulatory norms and policies (e.g. tariffs, labelling, imports, government oversight, etc.), how sustainable the production is (local or imported) and how to guarantee product availability. - In addition, the lack of effectiveness of this intervention suggests that it would not be feasible in LMICs where healthcare expenditure is constrained.\n Don't know  Varies  No  Probably No  Probably Yes  Yes\nRationale for judgement: There is no clear evidence of effectiveness.\n\n【47】 # Summary of GDG judgements on antenatal zinc supplementation \n\n【48】 # Draft implementation considerations\n\n【49】 # Research gaps\n- The GDG agreed that more research on the efficacy of zinc supplementation in pregnancy was needed and that trials of zinc supplementation should consider other nutritional supplements (e.g. iron and/or calcium) that women may be receiving as part of routine ANC. As iron supplementation is recommended in all settings, and calcium supplementation is recommended in settings with low dietary intake as part of routine ANC, research is needed to evaluate the interactions among these nutrients in relation to maternal and newborn outcomes.\nIn settings providing iron and folic acid as part of routine ANC, trials on zinc supplementation should include several doses of zinc along with either 30 mg and/or 60 mg of elemental iron, according to national guidance.\nInformation should be recorded carefully on the timing of the different supplements, whether taken at the same time or different times of the day, along with an assessment of the feasibility and acceptability of taking multiple supplements at different times in these trials.\n\n【50】 # Dissemination and implementation of the recommendation 4.1 Recommendation dissemination\n be used. The executive summary and recommendation from this publication will be translated into the six United Nations languages for dissemination through the WHO regional offices and during meetings organized or attended by WHO staff.\n\n【51】 # Implementation considerations and applicability issues\nThis updated recommendation supersedes the WHO ANC guideline recommendation on zinc supplementation that was issued in 2016 (recommendation A . The GDG agreed that there were no new implementation considerations or applicability issues specific to this recommendation, as it was recommended in a research context. Monitoring of the uptake and impact of this updated recommendation will be integrated into that of the 2016 WHO ANC guideline . For implementation considerations related to WHO recommendations on antenatal care for a positive pregnancy experience in general, please refer to this guideline and associated derivative products, which are available on the WHO websites.\n\n【52】 # Research implications\nThe GDG agreed that more research on the efficacy of zinc supplementation in pregnancy is needed and that trials of zinc supplementation should consider other nutritional supplements (e.g. iron and/or calcium) that women may be receiving as part of routine ANC. As iron supplementation is recommended in all settings and calcium supplementation is recommended in settings with low dietary intake as part of routine ANC, research is needed to evaluate the interactions among these nutrients in relation to maternal and newborn outcomes.\nIn settings providing iron and folic acid as part of routine ANC, trials on zinc supplementation should include several doses of zinc along with 30 mg and/or 60 mg of elemental iron, according to national guidance.\nInformation should be recorded carefully on the timing of the different supplements, whether taken at the same time or different times of the day, along with an assessment of the feasibility and acceptability of taking multiple supplements at different times in these trials.\n6 Updating the guideline WHO convenes the Executive GSG biannually to review WHO's current portfolio of maternal and perinatal health recommendations, and to advise on the prioritization of new and existing questions for recommendation development and updating. WHO will monitor the publication of new randomized trials on this topic. Any concern about the validity of the recommendation will be promptly communicated via the guideline website, 3 and plans will be made to update the recommendation, as necessary. WHO will prioritize its independent normative guidance informed by the strategic shifts embedded in its Constitution and the Thirteenth General Programme of Work 2019-2023.\nAll technical products developed during the process of developing this recommendation, including the Cochrane RevMan 4 file customized for priority outcomes, and the basis for quality ratings within the GRADE process, will be archived in the departmental shared folder for future reference and use.\nEvidence from studies with moderate risk of bias and design limitations.\nConfidence interval is imprecise.\nMore than 50% of the pooled effect from studies with moderate risk of bias and design limitations.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

This article focuses on quantitative differences which are based on a gradient and involve different averages. For example, men are taller than women on average, but an individual woman may be taller than an individual man.\nThis article describes differences which clearly represent a binary male/female spilt, such as human reproduction. Women give birth to babies; men do not. Though some sex differences are controversial, they are not to be confused with sexist stereotypes.\n\n【2】 # Genetic differences\nThe human genome is composed of 23 unique chromosome sets and every person carries two copies of each (one from mom and one from dad) for a total of 46 chromosomes.  Twenty-two chromosomes are autosomes, and the 23rd is the sex chromosome.  Two types of sex chromosomes exist in humans, the X and the Y.  Males have one X and one Y, while females carry two X chromosomes.  All the eggs created by a women will always contain X chromosomes, while male sperm will be on average 50 % X and 50% Y. Thus, the sex of human offspring is determined by the male sperm.\n\n【3】 # Physical differences\n\n【4】 ## Sexual dimorphism\nSexual dimorphism (two forms) refers to the general phenomenon in which male and female forms of an organism display distinct morphological characteristics or features.\nSexual dimorphism in humans is the subject of much controversy, especially relating to mental ability and psychological gender. (For a discussion, see biology of gender, sex and intelligence, gender, and transgender.) Obvious differences between men and women include all the features related to reproductive role, notably the endocrine (hormonal) systems and their physical, psychological and behavioural effects.\nSuch undisputed sexual dimorphism include gonadal differentiation, internal genital differentiation, external genital differentiation, breast differentiation and hair differentiation.\n published a popular essay, 'Neoteny: A Paleo-Anthropological Speculation', in 1996.\nComparative and social psychologists have observed that males and females, in general, differ in the way they carry books while walking. Upon using a classification system of the five common methods of carrying books, a high percentage of females will partially cover their body with the books they are carrying, such as by holding them in front of the chest. Most males carry their books at the side of body, leaving the front uncovered (Jenni, M.A. . The most common explanation of this observation is that women typically have less upper body strength than men, making it difficult to balance, and resulting in the need to rest the objects they are carrying on their bodies. Some psychologists hypothesize that it is a maternal instinct in many women causing them to carry inanimate objects in a protective manner.\n\n【5】 ### Appearances\n- On average, men are taller than women (.\n- Men usually have more body hair than women.\n- Men’s skin is thicker (more collagen) and oilier (more sebum) than women’s skin.\n- Women generally have a smaller waist in comparison to their hips  waist-hip ratio).\n- In men, the second digit (index finger) tends to be shorter than the fourth digit (ring finger), while in females the second tends to be longer than the fourth  digit ratio).\n- On average women tend to have skin that is 3-4% lighter than men. Scientists believe this is an adaptation required for increased production of Vitamin D during pregnancy. Vitamin D is necessary to help the body absorb calcium and deposit it in the bones of fast growing embryos.  By having lighter skin more of the sun's UV radiation can penetrate the skin to and increase their ability to produce vitamin D.\n- Women tend to have a lower center of gravity (shorter legs, longer torso, relative to height) and a larger hip section than men.\n\n【6】 # Reproduction\n- Female fertility declines after age 25 and ends with the menopause. Pregnancy in the 40s or later has been correlated with increased chance of Downs Syndrome in the children. Men are capable of fathering children into old age, although very recent research points to a possible correlation between a father's age and the inclination to have children with autism.. Adriana Iliescu was reported as the world's oldest woman to give birth, at age 66. Her record stood until Maria del Carmen Bousada de Lara gave birth to twin sons at Sant Pau Hospital in Barcelona, Spain on December 29, 2006, at the age of 67. In both cases IVF was used. The oldest known father was former Australian miner Les Colley, who fathered a child at age 93\n- Men typically produce billions of sperm each month, many of which are capable of fertilization. Women typically produce one egg a month that can be fertilized into an embryo. Thus during a lifetime men are able to father a significantly greater number of children than women can give birth to. The most fertile woman, according to the Guinness Book of World Records , was the wife of Feodor Vassilyev of Russia  who had 67 surviving children. The most prolific father of all time is believed to be the last Sharifian Emperor of Morocco, Mulai Ismail  who reportedly fathered more than 800 children from a Harem of 500 women.\n\n【7】 # Health\nWomen live longer than men in most countries (noexceptions are Afghanistan and Pakistan). One possible explanation is that more men die young because of war, criminal activity, accidents, and heart disease. The gap between males and females is decreasing in many developed countries as more women take up unhealthy practices that were once considered masculine like smoking and drinking, and more men practice healthier living. In Russia, however, the sex-associated gap has been increasing as male life expectancy declines .\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has produced a number of reports on gender and health. The following trends are shown:\n- Overall rates of mental illness are similar for men and women. There is no significant gender difference in rates of schizophrenia and bipolar depression. Women are more likely to suffer from unipolar depression, anxiety, eating disorders, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Men are more likely to suffer from alcoholism and antisocial personality disorder.\n- Worldwide, more men than women are infected with HIV. The exception is sub-Saharan Africa, where more women than men are infected.\n- Adult males are more likely to be diagnosed with tuberculosis.\n- Before menopause, women are less likely to suffer from cardiovascular disease. However, after age 60, the risk for both men and women is the same.\n- Overall, men are more likely to suffer from cancer, with much of this driven by lung cancer. In most countries, more men than women smoke, although this gap is narrowing especially among young women.\n- Women are twice as likely to be blind as men. In developed countries, this may be linked to higher life expectancy and age-related conditions. In developing countries, women are less likely to get timely treatments for conditions that lead to blindness such as cataracts and trachoma.\n- Women are more likely to suffer from osteoarthritis and osteoporosis.\nAnterior cruciate ligament injuries, especially in basketball, occur more often in women than in men.\nCertain conditions are X-linked recessive, in that the gene is carried on the X chromosome. Genetic females (XX) will have the disease only if both their X chromosomes are defective with a similar deficiency, whereas genetic males (XY) will have the disease if their only X chromosome is defective. For this reason, such conditions are far more common in males than in females. Examples of X-linked recessive conditions are color blindness, hemophilia, and Duchenne muscular dystrophy.\n\n【8】 ## Neurological\n- On average, male brains have approximately 4% more cells and 100 grams more brain tissue than females do. However, both sexes have similar brain weight to body weight ratios. Men have larger left inferior parietal lobes, while women have larger Wernicke's and Broca's areas . Evidence of gender differences in the size of the corpus callosum is ambiguous.\n- Women generally have faster blood flow to their brains and lose less brain tissue as they age than men do. \n\n【9】 ## Other health differences\n- Women generally have a higher body fat percentage than men. \n- Women usually have lower blood pressure than men, and women's hearts beat faster, even when they are asleep. \n- Men generally have more muscle tissue mass, particularly in the upper body.\n- Men and women have different levels of certain hormones. Men have a higher concentration of androgens while women have a higher concentration of estrogens.\n- On average, girls begin puberty approximately two years before boys.\n- Adult men have approximately 5.2 million red blood cells per cubic millimeter of blood, whereas women have approximately 4.6 million.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

The common name, shared with the closely related genus Consolida, is Larkspur.\nThe leaves are deeply lobed with 3-7 toothed, pointed lobes. The main flowering stem is erect, and varies greatly in size between the species, from 10 cm in some alpine species, up to 2 m tall in the larger meadowland species; it is topped by many flowers, varying between purple, blue, red, yellow or white. The flower has five petals which grow together to form a hollow flower with a spur at the end, which gives the plant its name. The seeds are small and shiny black. The plants flower from late spring to late summer, and are pollinated by butterflies and bumble bees. Despite the toxicity, Delphinium species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Dot Moth and Small Angle Shades.\nOther names are, lark's heel (Shakespeare), lark's claw and knight's spur. The scientific name is taken from Dioscorides and describes the shape of the bud, which is thought to look like a (rather fat) dolphin.\nThe Forking Larkspur (Delphinium consolida) prefers chalky loams. It grows wild in cornfields, but has become very rare nowadays. The flowers are commonly purple, but a white variety exists as well.\nBaker's larkspur (Delphinium bakeri) and Yellow larkspur (D. luteum), both native to very restricted areas of California, are highly endangered species.\n\n【1】 # Cultivation and uses\nMany species are cultivated as garden plants, with numerous cultivars having been selected for their denser, more prominent flowers.\nAll parts of the plant contain an alkaloid delphinine and are very poisonous, causing vomiting when eaten, and death in larger amounts. In small amounts, extracts of the plant have been used in herbal medicine. Gerard's herball reports that drinking the seed of larkspur was thought to help against the stings of scorpions, and that other poisonous animals could not move when covered by the herb, but does not believe it himself. Grieve's herbal reports that the seeds can be used against parasites, especially lice and their nits in the hair. A tincture is used against asthma and dropsy. The juice of the flowers, mixed with alum, gives a blue ink.\nThe plant was connected to Saint Odile and in popular medicine used against eye-diseases. It was one of the herbs used on the feast of St. John and as such warded against lightning. In Transylvania, it was used to keep witches from the ss, probably because of its blue color.\nLarkspur, especially tall larkspur, is a significant cause of cattle poisoning on rangelands in the western United States.  Larkspur is more common in high-elevation areas, and many ranchers will delay moving cattle onto such ranges until late summer when the toxicity of the plants is reduced.\n\n【2】 # Species\nAbout 250 species, including:\n- Delphinium alabamicum :  \tAlabama Larkspur\n- Delphinium alpestre : Colorado Larkspur\n- Delphinium altissimum\n- Delphinium andersonii : Anderson's Larkspur\n- Delphinium andesicola : Chiricahua Mountain Larkspur\n- Delphinia antoninum : Tracy's Larkspur\n- Delphinium bakeri: Baker's Delphinium\n- Delphinium barbeyi : Subalpine Larkspur\n- Delphinium basalticum : Basalt Larkspur\n- Delphinium bicolor : Little Larkspur\n- Delphinium brachycentrum : Northern Larkspur\n- Delphinium brownii\n- Delphinium brunonianum\n- Delphinium bulleyanum\n- Delphinium caeruleum\n- Delphinium californicum : California Larkspur\n- Delphinium cardinale\n- Delphinium carolinianum : Carolina Larkspur\n- Delphinium cashmerianum\n- Delphinium chamissonis : Chamisso's Larkspur\n- Delphinium cheilanthum\n- Delphinium consolida\n- Delphinium corymbosum\n- Delphinium decorum : Coastal Larkspur\n- Delphinium delavayi\n- Delphinium denudatum\n- Delphinium depauperatum : Slim Larkspur\n- Delphinium dictyocarpum\n- Delphinium distichum : Twospike Larkspur\n- Delphinium duhmbergii\n- Delphinium elatum : Candle Larkspur\n- Delphinium exaltatum : Tall Larkspur\n- Delphinium fissum\n- Delphinium formosum\n- Delphinium geraniifolium : Clark Valley Larkspur\n- Delphinium geyeri : Geyer's Larkspur\n- Delphinium glareosum : Olympic Larkspur\n- Delphinium glaucescens : Smooth Larkspur\n- Delphinium glaucum : Sierra Larkpsur\n- Delphinium gracilentum : Pine Forest Larkspur\n- Delphinium grandiflorum : Siberian Larkspur\n- Delphinium gypsophilum : Pinoche Creek Larkspur\n- Delphinium hansenii : Eldorado Larkspur\n- Delphinium hesperium : Foothill Larkspur\n- Delphinium hutchinsoniae : Monterey Larkspur\n- Delphinium hybridum\n- Delphinium inopinum : Unexpected Larkspur\n- Delphinium leroyi\n- Delphinium leucophaeum\n- Delphinium likiangense\n- Delphinium linarioides\n- Delphinium lineapetalum : Thinpetal Larkspur\n- Delphinium luteum : Yellow Larkspur\n- Delphinium maackianum\n- Delphinium macrocentron\n- Delphinium madrense : Sierra Madre Larkspur\n- Delphinium menziesii : Menzies' Larkspur\n- Delphinium multiplex : Kittitas Larkspur\n- Delphinium muscosum\n- Delphinium nelsonii\n- Delphinium newtonianum : Newton's Larkspur\n- Delphinium novomexicanum : White Mountain Larkspur\n- Delphinium nudicaule : Red Larkspur\n- Delphinium nuttallianum : Twolobe Larkspur\n- Delphinium nuttallii : Upland Larkspur\n- Delphinium occidentale: Subalpine Larkspur\n- Delphinium oxysepalum\n- Delphinium parishii : Desert Larkspur\n- Delphinium parryi : San Bernardino Larkspur\n- Delphinium patens : Zigzag Larkspur\n- Delphinium peregrinum\n- Delphinium pictum\n- Delphinium polycladon : Mountain Marsh Larkspur\n- Delphinium przewalskii\n- Delphinium purpusii : Kern County Larkspur\n- Delphinium pylzowii\n- Delphinium ramosum : Mountain Larkspur\n- Delphinium recurvatum : Byron Larkspur\n- Delphinium requienii\n- Delphinium robustum : Wahatoya Creek Larkspur\n- Delphinium roylei\n- Delphinium sapellonis : Sapello Canyon Larkspur\n- Delphinium scaposum : Tall Mountain Larkspur\n- Delphinium scopulorum : Rocky Mountain Larkspur\n- Delphinium semibarbatum\n- Delphinium speciosum\n- Delphinium stachydeum : Spiked Larkspur\n- Delphinium staphisagria\n- Delphinium sutchuense\n- Delphinium sutherlandii : Sutherland's Larkspur\n- Delphinium tatsienense\n- Delphinium treleasei : Glade Larkspur\n- Delphinium tricorne : Dwarf Larkspur\n- Delphinium triste\n- Delphinium trolliifolium : Columbian Larkspur\n- Delphinium uliginosum : Swamp Larkspur\n- Delphinium umbraculorum : Umbrella Larkspur\n- Delphinium variegatum : Royal Larkspur\n- Delphinium verdunense\n- Delphinium vestitum\n- Delphinium villosum\n- Delphinium virescens\n- Delphinium viridescens : Wenatchee Larkspur\n- Delphinium viride\n- Delphinium wootonii : Organ Mountain Larkspur\n- Delphinium xantholeucum : Yellow-white Larkspur\n- Delphinium yunnanense\n- Delphinium zalil : Zalil\n\n【3】 eo:Delfinio\n\n【4】 lt:Pentinius\nnl:Ridderspoor\nno:Ridderspore (Delphinium)\nsq:Delphinium", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Paternal mtDNA inheritance is observed in a small number of species, but in the vast majority, mtDNA is believed to be passed unchanged from a mother to her offspring.\n\n【1】 # In animals\nPaternal mtDNA inheritance in animals varies.  For example, in Mytilidae mussels, paternal mtDNA \"is transmitted through the sperm and establishes itself only in the male gonad.\"   In testing 172 sheep, \"The Mitochondrial DNA from three lambs in two half-sib families were found to show paternal inheritance.\"\nMitochondria in mammalian sperm are usually destroyed by the egg cell after fertilization.  In 1999 it was reported that paternal sperm mitochondria (containing mtDNA) are marked with ubiquitin to select them for later destruction inside the embryo. Some in vitro fertilization techniques, particularly injecting a sperm into an oocyte, may interfere with this.\n\n【2】 # In humans\nMany sources, notably companies that sell genealogical DNA tests, state that paternal mtDNA is never transmitted to offspring.  This belief is central to mtDNA genealogical DNA testing and to the theory of mitochondrial Eve.  However, there have been some studies that claimed to have found some cases of paternal mitochondrial inheritance in humans (e.g. Schwarz & Vissing , and it was proposed that in sexual reproduction, the tail of the sperm does enter the egg, and thus \"paternal leakage\" may occur.\nThe ideas about human paternal leakage were summed up in the 1996 study Misconceptions about mitochondria and mammalian fertilization: Implications for theories on human evolution: \nThe mixing of maternal and paternal mtDNA has been found in humans and chimpanzees.  However, there has been only a single conclusively proven case of human paternal mitochondrial DNA transmission.  All other reported cases can be ascribed solely to contamination and sample mix up.\n been shown that about 1-2% of a person's mitochondria can be inherited from the father .\nAccording to the 2005 study More evidence for non-maternal inheritance of mitochondrial DNA?:\n  In addition, heteroplasmy is a \"newly discovered form of inheritance for mtDNA. Heteroplasmy introduces slight statistical uncertainty in normal inheritance patterns.\"\nOn the other side of the issue are people who want to dismiss maternal mtDNA inheritance completely.  A surname project tutorial states, \"A male will rarely get his father's mtDNA.  So far, this has been observed one time in the past 20 years of research.\"   This single instance is cited as evidence that the whole field of Human mitochondrial genetics is invalid.\nIn either case, these phenomena throw doubt on the theory that all mtDNA can be traced back to a single female.  This theory of mitochondrial Eve, which aims to trace all humans to \"a woman living in sub-Saharan Africa about 200,000 years ago\" allows no room for the inheritance of paternal mtDNA.\n\n【3】 # In protozoa\nSome organisms, such as Cryptosporidium, have mitochondria with no DNA whatsoever.\n\n【4】 # In plants\n show paternal inheritance of mitochondria, such as the coast redwood, Sequoia sempervirens.\n\n【5】 # References and notes\n\n【6】 The exceptional mitochondrial DNA system of the mussel family Mytilidae] by E.

Three major advances aided by surgical robots have been remote surgery, minimally invasive surgery and unmanned surgery.  Major potential advantages of robotic surgery are precision and miniaturization.  Further advantages are articulation beyond normal manipulation and three-dimensional magnification.\n\n【1】 # History\nIn 1985 a robot, the PUMA 560, was used to place a needle for a brain biopsy using CT guidance. In 1988, the PROBOT, developed at Imperial College London, was used to perform prostatic surgery. The ROBODOC from Integrated Surgical Systems was introduced in 1992 to mill out precise fittings in the femur for hip replacement.  Further development of robotic systems was carried out by Intuitive Surgical with the introduction of the da Vinci Surgical System and Computer Motion with the AESOP and the ZEUS robotic surgical system.\nThe da Vinci Surgical System is comprised of three components: a surgeon’s console, a patient-side robotic cart with 2 arms manipulated by the surgeon, and a high-definition 3D vision system in connection with a camera introduced into the body by a voice-controlled third arm on the robotic cart. Articulating surgical instruments are mounted on the robotic arms which are introduced into the body through cannulas.  The surgeon’s hand movements are scaled and filtered to eliminate hand tremor then translated into micro-movements of the proprietary instruments. The da Vinci System is FDA cleared for a variety of surgical procedures including surgery for prostate cancer, hysterectomy and mitral valve repair and used in more than 800 hospitals in the Americas and Europe.  The da Vinci System was used in 48,000 procedures in 2006 and sells for about $1.2 million.\n- In 1997 a reconnection of the fallopian tubes operation was performed successfully in Cleavland using ZEUS.\n- In May 1998, Dr. Friedrich-Wilhelm Mohr using the Da Vinci surgical robot performed the first robotically assisted heart bypass at the Leipzig Heart Centre in Germany.\n- In 2001, Prof. Marescaux used the Zeus robot to perform a cholecystectomy on a pig in Strasbourg, France while in New York.\n- The first unmanned robotic surgery took place in May 2006 in Italy.\n\n【2】 # Applications\n\n【3】 ## Cardiac surgery\nEndoscopic coronary artery bypass (TECAB) surgery and mitral valve replacement have been performed.  Totally closed chest, endoscopic mitral valve surgeries are being performed now with the robot.\n\n【4】 ## Gastrointestinal surgery\nMultiple types of procedures have been performed with either the Zeus or da Vinci robot systems, including bariatric surgery.\n\n【5】 ## Gynecology\nReproductive surgery and ablative surgery including hysterectomy have been performed.\n\n【6】 ## Neurosurgery\nSeveral systems for stereotactic intervention are currently on the market. MD Robotic's NeuroArm is the world’s first MRI-compatible surgical robot.\n\n【7】 ## Orthopedics\nThe ROBODOC system was released in 1992 by the Integrated Surgical Systems, Inc.\n\n【8】 ## Pediatrics\nSurgical robotics has been used in many types of pediatric surgical procedures including: tracheoesophageal fistula repair, cholecystectomy, nissen fundoplication, morgagni hernia repair, kasai portoenterostomy, congenital diaphragmatic hernia repair, and others. On January 17, 2002, surgeons at Children's Hospital of Michigan in Detroit performed the nation's first advanced computer-assisted robot-enhanced surgical procedure at a children's hospital.\n\n【9】 ## Urology\nThe da Vinci robot is commonly used to remove the prostate gland for cancer, repair obstructed kidneys, repair bladder abnormalities and removed diseased kidneys.\n\n【10】 # Limitations\nCurrent equipment is expensive to obtain, maintain and operate.  If one of the older model non-autonomous robots is being used, surgeons and staff need special training.  Data collection of procedures and their outcomes remains limited.\n\n【11】 # Miniature robotics\nAs scientists seek to improve the versatility and utility of robotics in surgery, some are attempting to miniaturize the robots.  For example, the University of Nebraska Medical Center has led a multi-campus effort to provide collaborative research on mini-robotics among surgeons, engineers and computer scientists.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Common adverse reactions include hypersensitivity reactions, hemolytic anemia, nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, neutropenia, hypereflexia, seizures, interstitial nephritis, thrombophlebitis.\n\n【3】 # Adult Indications and Dosage\n\n【4】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Adult)\n- Penicillin G Sodium for Injection, USP is indicated in the treatment of serious infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms in the conditions listed below.\n- Appropriate culture and susceptibility tests should be done before treatment in order to isolate and identify organisms causing infection and to determine their susceptibility to penicillin G. Therapy with Penicillin G Sodium for Injection, USP may be initiated before results of such tests are known when there is reason to believe the infection may involve any of the organisms listed below, however, once these results become available, appropriate therapy should be continued.\n- To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of penicillin G sodium and other antibacterial drugs, penicillin G sodium should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria.\n- When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.\n- Penicillin G Sodium for lnjection, USP may be given intravenously or intramuscularly. The usual dose recommendations are as follows:\n- Because of its short half-life, Penicillin G is administered in divided doses, usually every 4 to 6 hours with the exception of meningococcal meningitis/septicemia, i.e., every 2 hours.\n- Creatinine clearance less than 10 mL/min/1.73 m2; administer a full loading dose followed by one-half of the loading dose every 8 to 10 hours.\n- Uremic patients with a creatinine clearance greater than 10 mL/min/1.73m2; administer a full loading dose followed by one-half of the loading dose every 4 to 5 hours.\n- Additional dosage modifications should be made in patients with hepatic disease and renal impairment.\n- For most acute infections, treatment should be continued for at least 48 to 72 hours after the patient becomes asymptomatic. Antibiotic therapy for Group A β-hemolytic streptococcal infections should be maintained for at least 10 days to reduce the risk of rheumatic fever.\n- Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit.\n- Solutions of penicillin should be prepared as follows\n- Loosen powder. Hold vial horizontally and rotate it while slowly directing the stream of diluent against the wall of the vial. Shake vial vigorously after all the diluent has been added. Depending on the route of administration, use Sterile Water for Injection, USP, 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, or Dextrose Injections, USP.\n- Penicillins are rapidly inactivated in the presence of carbohydrate solutions at alkaline pH.\n\n【5】 ## Off-Label Use and Dosage (Adult)\n\n【6】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\n- Lyme disease\n- Streptococcus group B infection of the infant, Intrapartum; Prophylaxis\n\n【7】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Penicillin G potassium in adult patients.\n\n【8】 # Pediatric Indications and Dosage\n\n【9】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Pediatric)\n- This product should not be administered to patients requiring less than one million units per dose.\n\n【10】 ## Off-Label Use and Dosage (Pediatric)\n\n【11】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nStreptococcus group B infection of the infant, Intrapartum; Prophylaxis\n\n【12】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Penicillin G potassium in pediatric patients.\n\n【13】 # Contraindications\n- A history of hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reaction to any penicillin is a contraindication.\n\n【14】 # Warnings\nThere is limited information regarding Penicillin G potassium Warnings' in the drug label.\n\n【15】 # Adverse Reactions\n\n【16】 ## Clinical Trials Experience\nThere is limited information regarding Clinical Trial Experience of Penicillin G potassium in the drug label.\n\n【17】 ## Postmarketing Experience\n- The Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction is a systemic reaction, that may occur after the initiation of penicillin therapy in patients with syphilis or other spirochetal infections (i.e., Lyme disease and Relapsing fever). The reaction begins one to two hours after initiation of therapy and disappears within 12 to 24 hours. It is characterized by fever, chills, myalgias, headache, exacerbation of cutaneous lesions, tachycardia, hyperventiliation, vasodilation with flushing and mild hypotension. The pathogenesis of the Herxheimer reaction may be due to the release from the spirochaete of host spyrogen.\n- The reported incidence of allergic reactions to all penicillins ranges from 0.7 to 10 percent in different studies. Sensitization is usually the result of previous treatment with a penicillin, but some individuals have had immediate reactions when first treated. In such cases, it is postulated that prior exposure to penicillin may have occurred via trace amounts present in milk or vaccines.\n- Two types of allergic reactions to penicillin are noted clinically – Immediate and delayed.\n- Immediate reactions usually occur within 20 minutes of administration and range in severity from urticaria and pruritus to angloneurotic edema, laryngospasm, bronchospasm, hypotension, vascular collapse and death.\n- Such immediate anaphylactic reactions are very rare and usually occur after parenteral therapy, but a few cases of anaphylaxis have been reported following oral therapy. Another type of immediate reaction, an accelerated reaction, may occur between 20 minutes and 45 hours after administration and may include urticaria, pruritus, fever and, occasionally, laryngeal edema.\n- Delayed reactions to penicillin therapy usually occur within 1 to 2 weeks after initiation of therapy. Manifestations include serum sickness-like symptoms, i.e., fever, malaise, urticaria, myalgia, arthralgia, abdominal pain and various skin rashes, ranging from maculopapular eruptions to exfoliative dermatitis.\n- Contact dermatitis has been observed in individuals who prepare penicillin solutions.\n- Pseudomembranous colitis has been reported with the onset occurring during or after penicillin G treatment. Nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, black or hairy tongue, and other symptoms of gastrointestinal irritation may occur, especially during oral therapy.\n- Reactions include neutropenia, which resolves after penicillin therapy is discontinued; Coombs-positive hemolytic anemia, an uncommon reaction, occurs in patients treated with intravenous penicillin G in doses greater than 10 million units/day and who have previously received large doses of the drug; and with large doses of penicillin, a bleeding diathesis, can occur secondary to platelet dysfunction.\n- Penicillin G Sodium for lnjection, USP (1 million units contains 1.68 mEq of sodium ion) may cause serious and even fatal electrolyte disturbances when given intravenously in large doses.\n- High dosage of penicillin G sodium may result in congestive heart failure due to high sodium intake.\n- Neurotoxic reactions including hyperreflexia, myoclonic twitches, seizures and coma have been reported following the administration of massive intravenous doses, and are more likely in patients with impaired renal function.\n- Renal tubular damage and interstitial nephritis have been associated with large intravenous doses of penicillin G. Manifestations of this reaction may include fever, rash, eosinophilia, proteinuria, eosinophiluria, hematuria and a rise in serum urea nitrogen. Discontinuation of penicillin G results in resolution in the majority of patients.\n- Phlebitis and thrombophlebitis may occur with intravenous administration.\n\n【18】 # Drug Interactions\nThere is limited information regarding Penicillin G potassium Drug Interactions in the drug label.\n\n【19】 # Use in Specific Populations\n\n【20】 ### Pregnancy\nPregnancy Category (FDA): B\n- Reproduction studies performed in the mouse, rat, and rabbit have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to penicillin G. Human experience with the penicillins during pregnancy has not shown any positive evidence of adverse effects on the fetus. There are, however, no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women showing conclusively that harmful effects of these drugs on the fetus can be excluded. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.\nPregnancy Category (AUS):\n- Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) Pregnancy Category\nThere is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Penicillin G potassium in women who are pregnant.\n\n【21】 ### Labor and Delivery\nThere is no FDA guidance on use of Penicillin G potassium during labor and delivery.\n\n【22】 ### Nursing Mothers\n- Penicillins are excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when penicillins are administered to a nursing woman.\n\n【23】 ### Pediatric Use\n- lncompletely developed renal function in newborns may delay elimination of penicillin; therefore, appropriate reductions in the dosage and frequency of administration should be made in these patients. All newborns treated with penicillins should be monitored closely for clinical and laboratory evidence of toxic or adverse effects.\n- Pediatric doses are generally determined on a weight basis and should be calculated for each patient individually.\n- The potential for toxic effects in children from chemicals that may leach from the single dose premixed intravenous preparation in plastic containers has not been evaluated.\n\n【24】 ### Geriatic Use\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Penicillin G potassium with respect to geriatric patients.\n\n【25】 ### Gender\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Penicillin G potassium with respect to specific gender populations.\n\n【26】 ### Race\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Penicillin G potassium with respect to specific racial populations.\n\n【27】 ### Renal Impairment\n- Penicillin G is relatively nontoxic, and dosage adjustments are generally required only in cases of severe renal impairment.\n\n【28】 ### Hepatic Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Penicillin G potassium in patients with hepatic impairment.\n\n【29】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Penicillin G potassium in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n\n【30】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\nThere is no FDA guidance one the use of Penicillin G potassium in patients who are immunocompromised.\n\n【31】 # Administration and Monitoring\n\n【32】 ### Administration\n- Oral\n- Intravenous\n\n【33】 ### Monitoring\n- All newborns treated with penicillins should be monitored closely for clinical and laboratory evidence of toxic or adverse effects.\n\n【34】 # IV Compatibility\nThere is limited information regarding IV Compatibility of Penicillin G potassium in the drug label.\n\n【35】 # Overdosage\n- Dose related toxicity may arise with the use of massive doses of intravenous penicillins (40 to 100 million units per day), particularly in patients with severe renal impairment.\n possible.\n- In case of overdosage, discontinue penicillin, treat symptomatically and institute supportive measures as required. If necessary, hemodialysis may be used to reduce blood levels of penicillin G, although the degree of effectiveness of this procedure is questionable.\n\n【36】 # Pharmacology\n\n【37】 ## Mechanism of Action\nThere is limited information regarding Penicillin G potassium Mechanism of Action in the drug label.\n\n【38】 ## Structure\n- Penicillin G sodium for Injection, USP is sterile penicillin G sodium powder for reconstitution. It is an antibacterial agent intended for intravenous or intramuscularly use.\n- Chemically, penicillin G sodium is designated 4-Thia-1-azabicyclo(3.2.-heptane-2-carboxylic acid,3,3-dimethyl-7-oxo-6--, -, monosodium salt and has the following structural formula:\n- Penicillin G sodium, a water soluble benzylpenicillin, is a white to almost white crystalline powder which is almost odorless and/or after reconstitution a colorless solution. The pH of freshly constituted solutions usually ranges from 5.0 to 7.5.\n- Penicillin G sodium for Injection, USP is supplied in vials equivalent to 5,000,000 units (5 million units) of penicillin G as the sodium salt, with 1.68 mEq of sodium per million units of penicillin G.\n\n【39】 ## Pharmacodynamics\nThere is limited information regarding Pharmacodynamics of Penicillin G potassium in the drug label.\n\n【40】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n- After an intravenous infusion of penicillin G, peak serum concentrations are attained immediately after completion of the infusion. In a study of ten patients administered a single 5 million unit dose of penicillin G intravenously over 3 to 5 minutes, the mean serum concentrations were 400 mcg/mL, 273 mcg/mL and 3 mcg/mL at 5 to 6 minutes, 10 minutes and 4 hours after completion of the injection, respectively.\n- In a separate study, five healthy adults were administered one million units of penicillin G intravenously, either as a bolus over 4 minutes or as an infusion over 60 minutes. The mean serum concentration eight minutes after completion of the bolus was 45 mcg/mL and eight minutes after completion of the infusion was 14.4 mcg/mL.\n- The mean β-phase serum half-life of penicillin G administered by the intravenous route in ten patients with normal renal function was 42 minutes, with a range of 31 to 50 minutes.\n- The clearance of penicillin G in normal individuals is predominantly via the kidney. The renal clearance, which is extremely rapid, is the result of glomerular filtration and active tubular transport, with the latter route predominating. Urinary recovery is reported to be 58 to 85% of the administered dose. Renal clearance of penicillin is delayed in premature infants, neonates and in the elderly due to decreased renal function. The serum half-life of penicillin G correlates inversely with age and clearance of creatinine and ranges from 3.2 hours in infants 0 to 6 days of age to 1.4 hours in infants 14 days of age or older.\n- Nonrenal clearance includes hepatic metabolism and, to a lesser extent, biliary excretion. The latter routes become more important with renal impairment.\n- Probenecid blocks the renal tubular secretion of penicillin. Therefore, the concurrent administration of probenecid prolongs the elimination of penicillin G and, consequently, increases the serum concentrations.\n enhances its penetration into the pericardial fluid. Penicillin G is actively secreted into the bile resulting in levels at least 10 times those achieved simultaneously in serum. Penicillin G penetrates poorly into human polymorphonuclear leukocytes.\n- In the presence of impaired renal function, the β-phase serum half-life of penicillin G is prolonged. β-phase serum half-lives of one to two hours were observed in azotemic patients with serum creatinine concentrations <3 mg/100 mL and ranged as high as 20 hours in anuric patients. A linear relationship, including the lowest range of renal function, is found between the serum elimination rate constant and renal function as measured by creatinine clearance.\n- In patients with altered renal function, the presence of hepatic insufficiency further alters the elimination of penicillin G. In one study, the serum half-lives in two anuric patients (excreting <400 mL urine/day) were 7.2 and 10.1 hours. A totally anuric patient with terminal hepatic cirrhosis had a penicillin half-life of 30.5 hours, while another patient with anuria and liver disease had a serum half-life of 16.4 hours.The dosage of penicillin G should be reduced in patients with severe renal impairment, with additional modifications when hepatic disease accompanies the renal impairment.\n- Hemodialysis has been shown to reduce penicillin G serum levels.\n\n【41】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\n- Penicillin G is bactericidal against penicillin-susceptible microorganisms during the stage of active multiplication. It acts by inhibiting biosynthesis of cell-wall mucopeptide. It is not active against the penicillinase-producing bacteria, which include many strains of staphylococci. Penicillin G is highly active in vitro against staphylococci (except penicillinase-producing strains), streptococci (groups A, B, C, G, H, L and M), pneumococci and Neisseria meningitidis. Other organisms susceptible in vitro to penicillin G are Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Corynebacteriumdiphtheriae, Bacillus anthracis, clostridia, Actinomyces species, Spirillum minus, Streptobacillusmonillformis, Listeria monocytogenes, and leptospira; Treponemapallidum is extremely susceptible.\n- Some species of gram-negative bacilli were previously considered susceptible to very high intravenous doses of penicillin G (up to 80 million units/day) including some strains of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, salmonella, shigella, Enterobacteraerogenes (formerly Aerobacteraerogenes) and Alcaligenesfaecalis. Penicillin G is no longer considered a drug of choice for infections caused by these organisms.\n- Quantitative methods that require measurement of zone diameters provide reproducible estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. One such standardized procedure1,2 which has been recommended for use with disks to test susceptibility of organisms to penicillin G uses the 10 Unit (U) penicillin disk. Interpretation involves the correlation of the diameters obtained in the disk test with the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for penicillin G.\n- Reports from the laboratory providing results of the standard single-disk susceptibility test with a 10 U penicillin disk should be interpreted according to the criteria provided in TABLE 1.\n- Quantitative methods that are used to determine minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) provide reproducible estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. One such standardized procedure1,3 uses a standardized dilution method (broth or agar) or equivalent with penicillin powder. The MIC values obtained should be interpreted according to the criteria provided in below \n- A report of “susceptible” indicates that the pathogen is likely to be inhibited by usually achievable concentrations of the antimicrobial compound in the blood. A report of “Intermediate” (I) indicates that the result should be considered equivocal, if the microorganism is not fully susceptible to alternative, clinically feasible drugs, the test should be repeated. This category implies possible clinical applicability in body sites where the drug is physiologically concentrated or in situations where high dosage of the drug can be used.\n provides a buffer zone that prevents small uncontrolled technical factors from causing major discrepancies in interpretation. A report of “resistant” indicates that the pathogen is not likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the concentrations usually achievable; other therapy should be selected.\n- Standardized susceptibility test procedures require the use of laboratory control microorganisms1,2,3. The 10 U penicillin G disk and the standard penicillin powder should provide respectively the following zone diameters and MIC values in these laboratory test quality control strains:\n\n【42】 # Clinical Studies\nThere is limited information regarding Clinical Studies of Penicillin G potassium in the drug label.\n\n【43】 # How Supplied\n- Penicillin G Sodium for lnjection, USP, for IM or IV use, is supplied in dry powder form in vials containing 5,000,000 units (5 million units) of crystalline penicillin G as the sodium salt, with 1.68 mEq of sodium per million units of penicillin G, in tray packs of 10 (NDC 0781-6153- and in tray packs of 50 (NDC 0781-6153-.\n\n【44】 ## Storage\n- Store dry powder at 20°-25°C (68°-77°F).\n- Sterile constituted solution may be kept in refrigerator (2° to 8°C) for 3 days without significant loss of potency.\n\n【45】 # Images\n\n【46】 ## Drug Images\n\n【47】 ## Package and Label Display Panel\n\n【48】 # Patient Counseling Information\nThere is limited information regarding Patient Counseling Information of Penicillin G potassium in the drug label.\n\n【49】 # Precautions with Alcohol\n- Alcohol-Penicillin G potassium interaction has not been established.

A reasonable index of suspicion of rabies among animals with neurologic signs of disease, the preservation of appropriate fresh brain tissue, and demonstrably proficient diagnostic laboratories are essential to the appropriate treatment of potentially exposed humans, as well as identification of at-risk animals for consideration of increased vaccination coverage.\n be aware of techniques for appropriate sample collection for antemortem diagnosis and clinical implications of test results.\n\n【1】 # Laboratory Capacity for Prompt Testing of Potentially Rabid Animals\nRapid and accurate laboratory testing allows a physician to initiate timely PEP in a human being who has had contact with a rabid animal. Equally important, the knowledge that an animal is not rabid rules out the necessity for expensive and extended treatment (eg, prophylaxis typically extends > 1 month). Characterization of people receiving PEP would elucidate the critical role of rapid, reliable, available diagnosis and the prevention of unnecessary medical treatment. If laboratory diagnosis is not available within a reasonable period, PEP is often initiated and then discontinued after negative laboratory results are obtained. In addition, rapid testing allows the initiation of appropriate quarantine and booster vaccinations for exposed domestic animals. General recommendations for the testing of animals suspected of rabies, as provided by the annual Compendium of Animal Rabies Control,12 should be followed.\nRecommendations-Timely ad hoc evaluation of specimens, even after business hours and on weekends, is encouraged. Adequate staffing by trained personnel for routine and emergency testing of suspect animals is a basic requirement for those public health laboratories performing diagnosis of rabies. Sufficient staffing enables laboratories to provide diagnostic testing on a routine basis and in emergency situations, such as when a human being is bitten, when the biting animal is suspected of having rabies, and when a physician is awaiting test results to provide PEP.\n\n【2】 # Precision in Diagnostic Performance \" of the Direct Fluorescent Antibody Test\nAdherence to established technique among laboratories performing the FA test is essential for accurate and reliable diagnosis of rabies. When performed properly, no other laboratory test for the diagnosis of rabies is as simple, sensitive, specific, and rapid as the direct FA test performed on fresh brain tissue.13 However, a recent survey of laboratories performing analysis of specimens with public hea lth implications revealed an array of divergent modifications to virtually every step of the FA test. 14Recommendations-Guidelines for validation and verification of procedural FA test modifications should be compiled. Statistically meaningful validations of the effect of any proposed modifications on the sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis of rabies should be required. National proficiency testing for diagnosis of rabies should be strongly supported, and all state and local laboratories should be encouraged to participate.\nTraining courses should be conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in association with the National Laboratory Training Network and other experts, consisting of lectures and routine laboratory sessions (eg, annually or biannually). The CDC should coordinate efforts to identify and promote aspects of the FA test that would provide a minimum national standard of diagnosis of rabies. This assessment should focus on equipment, procedures, training of personnel, and the number of tests performed annually by state and local laboratories.\nProfessional associations, such as the Association of State and Territorial Public Health Laboratory Directors (currently the Association of Public Health Laboratories ) and the American Public Health Association, should promote the importance of consistent methods for diagnosis of rabies among their members. Confirmatory methods (eg, virus isolation) for evaluating the sensitivity and specificity of a direct FA test should be available to and used by every laboratory performing rabies testing, with partnering as necessary, when a laboratory does not have the capacity for an in-house confirmatory test. Alternative tests for diagnosis of rabies should be evaluated by use of the FA test and virus isolation as standards, when such tests become available. This evaluation should include tests of fixed tissue from animals for which fresh tissue is unavailable.\n\n【3】 # Status of Rabies Virus Diagnostic Reagents\nThe FA test is the method of choice used by public health laboratories14 for routine diagnosis of rabies. At one time, the CDC and many state facilities produced diagnostic conjugates. Gradually, commercially available products met the widespread need for reliable reagents. In the past decade, however, great concern has evolved regarding ongoing problems with availability and variations in the quality of commercial diagnostic reagents and a decreasing number of commercial producers. Given the reemergence of rabies in the United States, high quality and reliably available reagents are a fundamental requisite for diagnosis and prevention of rabies.\nRecommendations-A reference reagent for quality control comparisons to commercial lots of diagnostic conjugates should be produced and maintained in adequate quantities at the CDC or at designated reference laboratories for the FA test. The CDC or designated reference laboratories should ensure that these reagents are readily available for diagnosis of rabies.\n\n【4】 # Discussion of Current Laboratory Issues and Dissemination of Information\nGiven the complex epizootic characteristics of rabies in the United States,15 communication among individuals at diagnostic laboratories is critical. For example, early detection of unusual epizootiologic patterns may reveal problems with animal translocation or an emerging rabies virus variant, as revealed by the emergence of rabies in raccoons and coyotes. In addition, effective communication is essential for timely warnings of issues that require problem solving (eg, identification of a poor quality diagnostic reagent) and for discussion and updates of current methods.\nRecommendations-An annual or biannual workshop on rabies should be held in conjunction with the American Society for Microbiology. The workshop format should include lectures and discussion of laboratory issues in the diagnosis of rabies. In addition, ~ 1 annual or biannual bench training workshop should be held at different sites in the United States. This training should be open to individuals from all state and local laboratories and should cover all aspects of diagnosis of rabies. Emphasis at this workshop should be on the exchange of ideas between participants. Within each region, a reference laboratory could be identified by agreement among states in the region with the cooperation of the CDC. Each state laboratory should be encouraged to provide training with the support of a reference laboratory and the CDC. A forum (eg, a moderated computer bulletin board or listserver) should be established for informal exchange between individuals at diagnostic laboratories. Membership in this forum would be by subscription.\n\n【5】 # National and Regional Capability \" for Typing Rabies Strains\nModern virologic techniques have  essential in clarifying the role of divergent rabies reservoirs in wildlife in the United States. \" Although sophisticated, these tools are increasingly becoming standard diagnostic procedure because of their capacity to elucidate characteristics of rabies. A clearer understanding of epizootiologic patterns will facilitate the formulation of appropriate public health information and policy for prevention and control of rabies. Support for the continued transfer of reagents and expertise from the CDC to state diagnostic laboratories is critically needed with regard to advanced diagnosis of rabies beyond the routine FA test, such as monoclonal antibody analysis and polymerase chain reaction-based typing methods.\nRecommendations-A strong commitment should be made to expand resources and to continue a leadership role for the national rabies laboratory at the CDC. The CDC should be encouraged to maintain an experienced laboratory staff familiar with routine diagnostic procedures, to develop new technologies, and to facilitate practice of these technologies at appropriate federal, regional, and state agencies. Proposed reference laboratories should be identified and supported by the CDC and the APHL to provide confirmation of diagnostic tests, serologic testing, and virus typing. A format (eg, a limited access Web site) should be established for the routine sharing of information among any reference laboratories and the national laboratory at the CDC.\nAt the present time, instructions to professionals with regard to samples for rabies testing in human beings have been made more widely available through postings in a professional information section on the CDC rabies Web page . A videotape on the proper removal of animal brains for diagnosis of rabies has been produced and distributed to state health laboratories. A comprehensive national rabies laboratory training session was held in January 1998 in San Antonio, Tex; another event is in the planning stages for 2000. Unfortunately, limitations in the travel funding of laboratorians preclude the participation of some individuals. An additional monoclonal antibody preparation has become available, but the only commercial polyclonal rabies diagnostic reagent continues to vary in availability and quality. Although training by region has advanced, the need for additional transfer of viral typing technology to state laboratories remains high.\n\n【6】 # Preview of Article III\nThe third and final article in this series will be published in the Dec 1, 1999 issue of JAVMA and will review the incidence of rabies in wildlife; it will conclude with recommendations for control of wildlife rabies.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

The recommendation was graded as conditional because of very low certainty of the evidence about effects in the population of interest. Primary implementation consideration for policy makers and providers: - Persons with autoimmune rheumatic diseases should be able to access a third vaccine dose if desired, and not be required to take additional steps to obtain their vaccination.The CRA panel decided on a conditional recommendation for a third dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccination in persons aged 18 and older with autoimmune rheumatic disease. The panel balanced the# \nvery low certainty in the moderate benefits of a third dose (prevention of symptomatic infection) against the very low certainty of evidence for trivial harms. The panel discussed that the expected benefits are likely to vary considerably in individuals by current medications, age, and other comorbidities, but the expected harms are likely to be trivial. The decision to receive a third dose should be an individual discussion between a patient and their healthcare provider.\n\n【1】 # Subgroup considerations\nThe benefits of a third dose will likely vary considerably between individuals. Subgroups of patients in whom serological protection has been shown to be lower would be expected to have the greatest potential benefit from a third dose. Evidence is being accumulated on clinical outcomes and serological responses to COVID vaccination in patients with ARDs in a living systematic review , and will inform updates to this guideline.\nAs of October 2021, the evidence supports the following:\n showed decreased immunogenicity . It is likely that some medications (hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine) have little effect on serological response.\n\n【2】 # Implementation considerations\n- As access to third doses is determined by provincial health authorities, it will be essential to ensure people with ARDs do not face unnecessary additional barriers. People with ARDs should not be required to obtain a physician letter as proof of an informed decision discussion. - People with ARDs may have mobility limitations and appropriate access to vaccine clinics should be ensured.\n\n【3】 # Monitoring and evaluation\n- Monitoring of vaccine uptake should occur in people with ARDs, including populations at risk of inequity. Low uptake may point to barriers to access or hesitancy. - The frequency of serious adverse events, disease flares, and COVID-19 infection/serious outcomes should be followed in patients with ARDs who do and do not receive the vaccine. - People with ARDs should be encouraged to track their immunization history using an online Canadian vaccination tracker, developed with funding support from the Public Health Agency of Canada .\n\n【4】 # Research priorities\n- Randomized controlled trial evidence for the effect of a third dose in ARDs as compared with placebo - Observational evidence on the frequency of harms (in particular serious adverse events/serious disease flares) in people with ARD - Evidence comparing the frequency of serious adverse events and autoimmune adverse events in people with ARDs to those without ARD - Evidence on the benefits (both clinical outcomes and serological studies) in people with ARDs on different medications, including in pediatric populations - Evidence on patient values and preferences for the benefits and harms across different patient populations - Understanding vaccine hesitancy and barriers to vaccine access faced by persons with ARDs - Understanding vaccine benefits and harms in populations at risk for inequities.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

They are available in many shapes, sizes, and styles.\nThe retractor was invented by Abu al-Qasim, an Islamic physician, over 1000 years ago.\n\n【1】 # History\nSurgical retractors probably originate with very basic tool use in the Stone Age. Branches or antlers of various shapes were used to dig and extract food from the ground. As the use of tools evolved, a variety of instruments came about to substitute for the use of hooked or grasping fingers in the butchering of meat or dissection of bodies. The use of metals in tool making was of great importance. A variety of Roman metal instruments of the hook and retractor family have been found by archeologists. These instruments would generally be called hooks if the end was as narrow as the handle of the instrument. If the end was broad, it would be called a retractor. Also arising from this group of tools were other related tools for displacing (elevators and spatulas) and scooping (spoons and curettes).\nIn a description of the procedure of tonsillectomy from the 7th century CE, Paul of Aegina documents the use of a tongue spatula to keep the tongue out of the way while a form of tonsil hook is used to bring the tonsil forward for excision.\n known as Albucasis or Abulcasis, described a variety of surgical instruments including retractors in his famous text Al-Tasrif.\nVesalius described a variety of hooks and retractors in the 1500's.\nDr. von Mikulicz invention of a hinged rib spreading retractor in 1904 headed a flurry of development in the early 20th century.\n\n【2】 # Current\nThe following is a list of surgical retractors in current use:\n- Lahey Retractor\n- Senn Retractor\n- Blair (Rollet) Retractor\n- Rigid Rake\n- Flexible Rake\n- Ragnell Retractor\n- Linde-Ragnell Retractor\n- Davis Retractor\n- Volkman Retractor\n- Mathieu Retractor\n- Jackson Tracheal Hook\n- Crile Retractor\n- Meyerding Finger Retractor\n- Little Retractor\n- Love Nerve Retractor\n- Green Retractor\n- Goelet Retractor\n- Cushing Vein Retractor\n- Langenbeck Retractor\n- Richardson Retractor\n- Richardson-Eastmann Retractor\n- Kelly Retractor\n- Deaver Retractor\n- Parker Retractor\n- Parker-Mott Retractor\n- Roux Retractor\n- Mayo-Collins Retractor\n- U.S. Army Retractor\n- Ribbon Retractor\n- Alm Retractor\n- Self Retaining Retractors\n- Gelpi Retractor\n- Weitlaner Retractor\n- Beckman-Weitlaner Retractor\n- Beckman-Eaton Retractor\n- Beckman Retractor\n- Adson Retractor\n- Balfour Retractor", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Halfmask respirators are not recommended for use in any atmosphere greater than 10 x PEL because of the probability of accidently breaking the facepiece to face seal due to the work condition in a confined space. Also, gas masks designed for the same respiratory protection may be substituted for chemical cartridge respirators in the I I ) , but they are more cumbersome and restrictive to movement. The minimum service time of self-contained breathing apparatus shall be calculated on the entry time, plus the maximum work period, plus twice the estimated escape time for safety margin.\nThe respirators used shall be NIOSH and MSHA approved devices and shall be fitted and maintained in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.134. However, suppliedair respirators purchased before 1975 and bearing Bureau of Mines approval may be used until March 31, 1980. Self-contained breathing apparatus, with audible alarms and all gas masks, approved by the Bureau of Mines may be used until further notice.\n(g) Hand Protection -If hands are exposed to rough surfaces or sharp edges, the degree of protection can range from canvas to metal mesh gloves, depending on the material handled.\nGloves made of impervious rubber or similar material are to be worn to protect against toxic or irritating materials.\nHeat protective gloves are required when employees handle objects with temperatures greater than 60 C (140 F ) . Where a current flow through the body of more than 5 milliamperes may result from contact with energized electrical equipment, employees shall wear insulating gloves that have been visually inspected before each use.\nAbove 5,000 volts, rubber gloves in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.137 shall be worn.\nAdditional safety equipment that is necessary to protect the worker in the environment of a confined space: a safety belt with \"D\" rings for attaching a life line shall be worn at all times; the combination of a body harness and/or safety belt with life line shall be used when an employee is required to enter to complete the gas analysis; when an employee is working in an area where entry for purposes of rescue would be contraindicated (special limitations or fire hazard); when any failure of ventilation would allow the build-up of toxic or explosive gases within the time necessary to evacuate the area, or when the atmosphere is Immediately dangerous to life and health. Safety belts may be used as the primary means of suspension for the life line only when rescue may be made by keeping the disabled body in a position that will maintain easy passage through exit openings. If the exit opening is less than 18 inches (45 cm) in diameter, then a wrist type harness shall be used. When it is determined by the qualified person that none of the special hazards associated with confined spaces pose an immediate threat to life, as in a Class C entry, then life lines shall be readily available but not used during entry and work procedures.\nOther protective measures shall inclu\nWhen employees enter a confined space, a barricade shall be erected if inadvertent entry poses a problem. The barricade shall have a mechanism to prevent closure of the escapeway, signs warning of the danger present, a physical barrier (fence) to keep the area clear, and an adequate platform (3 feet x 3 feet as a minimum) for entry or exit. Such added features as a tripod with block and tackle for safety lines and communication equipment should be considered when the entry plan is formulated. The employer shall be responsible for maintenance of the barricade system.  -Work Practices (Class A, B, and C) Before entering a confined space, employees shall review the specific guidelines appropriate for safe entry and emergency exit. These guidelines or standards shall be compiled by the qualified person and be definitive on all the possible hazards. Areas covered by such guidelines shall follow this recommended standard.\n(a) Purging and Ventilating (Class A, B) Environmental control within a confined space is accomplished by purging and ventilating. The method used will be determined by the potential hazards that arise due to the product stored or produced, suspected contaminants, the work to be performed, and the design of the confined space. When ventilating and/or purging operations are to be performed, the blower controls shall be at a safe distance from the confined space. In a Class A entry, an audible warning device shall be installed in all equipment to signal when there is a ventilation failure. When a ventilation system is operational, air flow measurements shall be made before each workshift to ensure that a safe environmental level is maintained. Initial testing of the atmosphere shall be performed from outside the confined space before ventilation begins to determine what precautions are necessary in purging and ventilating.\nTesting of more remote regions within the confined space may be performed once the immediate area within the confined space has been made safe. Exhaust systems shall be designed to protect workers in the surrounding area from contaminated air. If flammable concentrations are present all electrical equipment shall comply with the requirements of NEC (NFPA no.  hazardous locations, and the bonding requirements of Article 250 of NEC, 1978.\nWhere continuous ventilation is not a part of the operating procedure, the atmosphere shall be tested until continuous acceplevels of oxygen and contaminants are maintained for three tests at 5-minute intervals. Care shall be taken to prevent recirculation of contaminated air and interaction of airborne contaminants.\nContinuous general ventilation shall be maintained where toxic atmospheres are produced as part of a work procedure, such as welding or painting, or where a toxic atmosphere may develop due to the nature of the confined space, as in the case of desorption from walls, or evaporation of residual chemicals. General ventilation is an effective procedure for distributing contaminants from a local generation point throughout the work space to obtain maximum dilution.\nHowever, special precautions shall be taken if the ventilating system partially blocks the exit opening. These precautions include a method for providing respirable air to each worker for the time necessary for exit, and a method of maintaining communications.\nLocal exhaust ventilation shall be provided when general ventilation is not effective due to restrictions in the confined space or when high concentrations of contaminants occur in the breathing zone of the worker. Local high concentrations of contaminants may occur during work activities such as welding, painting, and chemical cleaning. The worker shall not be exposed to concentrations of contaminants in excess of those specified in 29 CFR Part 1910 Sub Part Z. Therefore, respiratory protection, as recommended in  , may be needed in addition to engineering controls. The use of respiratory protection will be determined by the qualified person. However, when fumes may be generated that contain highly toxic or other airborne metal contaminants, the provisions of 29 CFR 1910.252 shall be observed. When freely moving exhaust hoods are used to provide control of fumes generated during welding, such hoods shall maintain a velocity of 100 feet per/minute in the zone of the welding. The effective force of freely moving exhaust hoods is decreased by approximately 90% at a distance of one duct diameter from the plane of the exhaust opening. Therefore, to obtain maximum effectiveness the welder shall re-position the exhaust hood as he changes welding locations to keep the hood in close proximity to the fume source. Special precautions shall be taken when outgassing or vaporization of toxic and/or flammable substances are likely. If the vapor-generating rate can be determined, the exhaust rate required can be calculated to dilute the atmosphere below the PEL and/or 10% of the LFL, whichever is the lower. This shall be the lowest accepventilation rate. If the area of concern is relatively small, diffusion of the contaminants may be controlled by enclosure with a relatively low volume exhaust for control, or by exhaust hoods located as close as possible to the area of vaporization or outgassing. If the area to be ventilated is too extensive to be controlled by local exhaust, then general ventilation procedures shall be used to control the contaminant level. When the problem of outgassing is due to the application of protective coatings or paint, ventilation shall be continued until the build-up of a flammable and/or toxic atmosphere is no longer possible.\nThere are three components necessary for combustionr fuel, oxygen, and a source of ignition. If work with fire becomes necessary in a confined space and the source of fuel cannot be controlled, then the atmosphere shall be inerted. This is a highly hazardous work situation, and continuous monitoring of the inert make-up ventilation is mandatory. Monitoring shall include flow measurement as well as gas analysis.\nThe inerting operation shall be continuously monitored and supervised by the qualified person. Since every confined space will have its own infiltration rate, inerting shall continue for the entire duration of the work at a rate that will prevent air from entering the confined space. The isolation procedures shall be specific for each type of confined space. Safety equipment required during this procedure shall be designated by the qualified person and be dependent upon the potential hazards involved. A Class A or B confined space shall be completely isolated from all other systems by physical disconnection, double block and bleed, or blanking off all lines. In continuous systems, where complete isolation is not possible, such as sewers or utility tunnels, specific written safety procedures that are approved and enforced by the employer shall be used. Blanks used to seal off lines shall be capable of withstanding the maximum working pressure or load of the line (with a minimum safety factor of , be provided with a gasket on the pressure side to insure a leakproof seal, and be made of chemically nonreactive material. Shutoff valves serving the confined space, shall be locked in the closed position and tagged for Identification.\nIn addition to blanking, pumps and compressors serving these lines entering the confined space shall be locked out to prevent accidental activation.\nAll blanks for that specific confined space shall be recorded on the entry permit and recorded in the employer' s file, which shall be available for inspection.\n be recorded on the entry permit.\nAdditional procedures, which are necessary when the confined space is of a double wall type construction, eg, water jacketed or similar type, shall be determined by the qualified person and noted on the entry permit.\n\n【10】 # Electrical\nisolation of the confined space to prevent accidental activation of moving parts that would be hazardous to the worker is achieved by locking circuit breakers and/or disconnects in the open (off) position with a key-type padlock. The only key is to remain with the person working inside the confined space.\nIf more than one person is inside the confined space, each person shall place his own lock on the circuit breaker. In addition to the lockout system, there must be an accompanying tag that identifies the operation and prohibits use.\n be blocked in such a manner that there can be no accidental rotation.\n(c) Cleaning (Class A, B, and C) Procedures and processes used to clean the inside of a confined space shall be reviewed and authorized by the qualified person. The method to be prescribed shall be dependent upon the product in the space. If the confined space contains a flammable atmosphere above the upper flammable limit, it shall be purged with an inert gas to remove the flammable substance before ventilating with air. Initial cleaning shall be done from outside the tank if at all possible. Special procedures should be adopted to handle the hazards created by the cleaning process itself. For example: if the tank is steamed,  it shall be allowed to cool prior to entry;  ventilation shall be maintained during neutralization procedures to prevent build-up of toxic materials;  steaming shall not be used as a cleaning method vrtien the product stored was a liquid with an autoignition temperature 120% or less of the steam temperature, and  the pipe or nozzle of the steam hose shall be bonded to the tank to decrease the generation of static electricity that could accumulate in tanks during steaming procedures.\nThese and other hazards and controls shall be evaluated by the qualified person.\n\n【11】 # (d) Equipment and Tools (Class A, B, and C)\nEquipment and tools to be used in a confined space shall be carefully inspected and shall meet the following requirements:\n Hand tools shall be kept clean and in good repair.\n Porelectric tools, equipment, and lighting shall be approved in accordance with 29 CFR Part 1910 Sub Part S and be equipped with a ground fault circuit interrupter that meets the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.309. All grounds shall be checked before electrical equipment is used in a confined space.\n All electrical cords, tools, and equipment shall be of heavy duty type with heavy duty insulation and inspected for visually detecdefects before use in a confined space.\n Air driven power tools shall be used when flammable liquids are present. The use of air driven power tools will reduce the risk of explosion, not eliminate it.\nExplosions can arise by tools overheating (drilling), sparks produced by striking (percussion), grinding or discharge of accumulated electrostatic charges developed from the flow of compressed air.\n Lighting used in Class A and B confined spaces shall be of explosion proof design and where necessary, equipped with guards.\nOnly equipment listed by the Underwriters Laboratories for use in Division 1, atmospheres of the appropriate class and group, or approved by U.S.\n\n【12】 # Bureau of Mines or Mining Enforcement and Safety Administration or Mine\nSafety and Health Administration, or the US Coast Guard shall be used.\nLighting shall not be hung by electric cords, unless specifically designed for that purpose. The illumination of the work area shall be sufficient to provide for safe work conditions as referenced in the ANSI standard All-1-1965, or the revision, 1970. Under no circumstances will matches or open flames be used in a confined space for illumination.\n Cylinders of compressed gases shall never be taken into a confined space, and shall be turned off at the cylinder valve when not in use. Exempt from this rule are cylinders that are part of self-contained breathing apparatus or resuscitation equipment.  Scaffolding and staging shall be properly designed to carry maximum expected load (safety factor of , be equipped with traction type planking, and meet the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.28.\n Electrical lines, junctions and appurtenances will be in accordance with National Electrical Code (NEC) and National Fire code (NFC) as cited in 29 CFR 1910.309.\n Only hose lines and components designed specially for the compressed gas and working pressure shall be used, and such systems shall have a pressure relief valve outside the confined space.  All equipment that may be used in a flammable atmosphere shall be approved as explosion proof or intrinsically safe for the atmosphere involved by a recognized testing laboratory such as the US Bureau of Mines, MESA, or MSHA for methane and by the Underwriters Laboratories or by Factory Mutual for all cases.\n(e) Recordkeeping (Class A, B)\nThe employer shall maintain a written record of training including safety drills, inspections, tests, and maintenance. The records shall be retained 1 year after the last date of training, inspection, test, or maintenance. In the event of separation of the employee, disposal of equipment or appliance, records may be disposed of after 1 year.\nWhere atmospheric testing indicates the presence of a toxic substance, records shall be maintained in accordance with the existing Federal regulation(s).\nThese records shall include the dates and times of measurements, duties and location of the employees within the confined space, sampling and analytical methods used, number, duration, and results of the samples taken, PEL concentrations estimated from these samples, type of personal protective equipment used, if any, and employees' names. These records shall be made available to the designated representatives of the Secretary of Labor, of the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, of the employer, and of the employee or former employee.\n\n【13】 # I I . INTRODUCTION\nThis document presents the criteria and the recommended standard based thereon that were prepared to meet the need for preventing occupational injuries and deaths associated with persons entering, working in, and exiting confined spaces. This document does not address the specialized areas of radiation, inert atmospheres or hyperbaric atmospheres; except to recognize they do exist and represent a potential hazard. The criteria document fulfills the responsibility of the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, under (a) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 to \"develop and establish recommended occupational safety and health standards.\"\nAfter reviewing data and consulting with others, NIOSH developed criteria upon which standards can be established to protect the health and to provide for the safety of workers exposed to occupational hazards. It should be noted that criteria for a recommended standard should enable management and labor to develop better work practices and more appropriate training programs that will result in safer work environments.\nSimply complying with the recommended standard should not be the final goal.\nThe worker who enters a confined space may be, or often is exposed to multiple hazards due primarily either to ignorance of the potential hazards or negligence in the enforcement of safety regulations. Ignorance and negligence have led to deaths by asphyxiation, by fire and explosion, and by fatal exposure to toxic materials. NIOSH is aware that a number of deaths occur each year when workers must enter and work in a confined space, and it recognizes that due to current data collection m e t h o d s , an estimate of the injuries and deaths which do occur will be inaccurate. Also, since there is no specific Standard Industrial Classification where these injuries and deaths are recorded for confined spaces, they are recorded in several different categories, thereby giving the appearance of a limited exposure to the hazard. These criteria for a standard are a part of a continuing series of documents published by NIOSH. The proposed standard applies only to entering into, working in, and exiting from confined spaces as applicable under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970.\nThe method used in this study consisted of developing, evaluating, and recording information from extensive literature searches, site visits to various industries, and consultation with reviewers knowledgeable on the subject of confined spaces.\nStandards covering issues of occupational safety and health that are of general application without regard to any specific industry are intended to be applicable to this recommended standard even though no specific reference is made to them. Examples of these general areas are: exposure to toxic chemicals, noise, temperature extremes, and general duty requirements.\n\n【14】 # III. CONFINED SPACE HAZARDS (a) Overview\nThe hazards encountered and associated with entering and working In confined spaces are capable of causing bodily Injury, Illness, and death to the worker.\nAccidents occur among workers because of failure to recognize that a confined space is a potential hazard.\nIt should therefore be considered that the most unfavorable situation exists in every case and that the danger of explosion, poisoning, and asphyxiation will be present at the onset of entry.\nBefore forced ventilation is initiated, information such as restricted areas within the confined space, voids, the nature of the contaminants present, the size of the space, the type of work to be performed, and the number of people involved should be considered. The ventilation air should not create an additional hazard due to recirculation of contaminants, improper arrangement of the inlet duct, or by the substitution of anything other than fresh (normal) air (approximately 20.9% oxygen, 79.1% nitrogen by volume). The terms air and oxygen are sometimes considered synonymous.\nHowever, this is a dangerous assumption, since the use of oxygen in place of fresh (normal) air for ventilation will expand the limits of flammability and increase the hazards of fire and explosion.\nHazardous conditions to be discussed in this Chapter inclu\nAn estimation of the number of workers potentially exposed to confined spaces would be difficult to produce. A report prepared under contract for NIOSH  shows that the rate of confined space related injuries in the shipbuilding and repair industry is 4.8%.\nProjected on a national level, 2,448 accidents per year may be attributed to the hazards of working in confined spaces in this single Industry. The Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) 373, Shipbuilding and Repair Industry, has a 23.9% injury rate. Based on this injury rate 5% of all accidents in the Shipbuilding and Repair Industry occur while working in and around confined spaces. Because of the lack of data it is not possible at this time to project this proportion of confined space related injuries to other industries . Based on the total working population of selected specific SIC codes, and a rough estimate of the percentage of each category who may work in confined spaces at some time, NIOSH estimates that millions of workers may be exposed to hazards in confined spaces each year.\n\n【15】 # (b) Types of Confined Spaces\nConfined spaces can be categorized generally as those with open tops and with a depth that will restrict the natural movement of air, and enclosed spaces with very limited openings for entry . In either of these cases the space may contain mechanical equipment with moving par t s . Any combination of these parameters will change the nature of the hazards encountered. Degreasers, pits, and certain types of storage tanks may be classified as open Overview and Magni t u d e of the P r o b l e m topped confined spaces that usually contain no moving parts. However, gases that are heavier than air (butane, propane, and other hydrocarbons) remain in depressions and will flow to low points where they are difficult to remove .\nOpen topped water tanks that appear harmless may develop toxic atmospheres such as hydrogen sulfide from the vaporization of contaminated water . Therefore, these gases (heavier than air) are a primary concern when entry into such a confined space is being planned. Other hazards may develop due to the work performed in the confined space or because of corrosive residues that accelerate the decomposition of scaffolding supports and electrical components.\nConfined spaces such as sewers, casings, tanks, silos, vaults, and compartments of ships usually have limited access. The problems arising in these areas are similar to those that occur in open topped confined spaces. However, the limited access increases the risk of injury.\n be trapped within an enclosed type confined space, especially those with access from the bottom or side.\nHazards specific to a confined space are dictated by:  the material stored or used in the confined space; as an example, damp activated carbon in a filtration tank will absorb oxygen thus creating an oxygen deficient atmosphere ;  the activity carried out, such as the fermentation of molasses that creates ethyl alcohol vapors and decreases the oxygen content of the atmosphere ; or  the external environment, as in the case of sewer systems that may be affected by high tides, heavier than air gases, or flash floods .\nThe most hazardous kind of confined space is the type that combines limited access and mechanical devices.\n contain physical hazards that further complicate the work environment and the entry and exit process.\n\n【16】 # (c) Reasons for Entering Confined Spaces\nEntering a confined space as part of the industrial activity may be done for various reasons. It is done usually to perform a necessary function, such as inspection, repair, maintenance (cleaning or painting), or similar operations which would be an infrequent or irregular function of the total industrial activity .\n be made during new construction. Potential hazards should be easier to recognize during construction since the confined space has not been used. The types of hazards involved will be limited by the specific work practices. When the area meets the criteria for a confined space, all ventilation and other requirements should be enforced.\nOne of the most difficult entries to control is that of unauthorized entry, especially when there are large numbers of workers and trades involved, such as welders, painters, electricians, and safety monitors.\nA final and most important reason for entry would be emergency rescue. This, and all other reasons for entry, must be well planned before initial entry is made and the hazards must be thoroughly reviewed. The standby person and all rescue personnel should be aware of the structural design of the space, emergency exit procedures, and life support systems required.\n\n【17】 # Hazardous Atmospheres\nHazardous atmospheres encountered in confined spaces can be divided into four distinct categories: (a) Flammable, (b) Toxic, (c) Irritant and/or Corrosive, and (d) Asphyxiating.\n(a) Flammable Atmosphere A flammable atmosphere generally arises from enriched oxygen atmospheres, vaporization of flammable liquids, byproducts of work, chemical reactions, concentrations of combustible dusts, and desorption of chemicals from inner surfaces of the confined space.\nAlther  reported on a case involving workers in an enriched oxygen atmosphere. Two men entered a newly constructed tank to repair a bulge which had formed after the flange of the manhole was welded to the tank. The planned repair procedure was to have two men enter the tank with a jack to force the flange of the manhole into place while a third worker heated the bulge from the outside. To accomplish this procedure the men had to close the manhole.\nTo improve the air within the tank, oxygen used for welding was blown in through an opening. A worker on the outside noticed through the opening that the hair of one of the workmen inside was on fire. The cover was immediately removed and one of the workers managed to escape, his clothing was burning rapidly, the second worker had collapsed and remained unconscious inside. It became necessary to invert the tank to remove the unconscious workman.\nBoth workmen who were doing the work inside suffered serious burns. One died a short time later; the second was hospitalized for several months. A rescuer in the operation was burned on the hands.\nInvestigation of the accident revealed the use of oxygen in place of normal air increased the flammability range of combustibles. Enrichment of the atmosphere with only a few percent of oxygen above 21% will cause an increase in the range of flammability, hair as well as clothing will absorb the oxygen and burn violently. Enriched oxygen atmospheres which expand the region of flammability could be the result of improper blanking off of oxygen lines, chemical reactions which liberate oxygen, or inadvertently purging the space with oxygen in place of air .\nAn atmosphere becomes flammable when the ratio of oxygen to combustible material in the air is neither too rich nor too lean for combustion to occur. Combustible gases or vapors will accumulate when there is inadequate ventilation in areas such as a confined space.\n be noted that lighter than air gases may rise and develop a flammable concentration if trapped above the opening.\nThe byproducts of work procedures can generate flammable or explosive conditions within a confined space. Specific kinds of work such as spray painting can result in the release of explosive gases or vapors . III-3 shows that approximately one-third of the events identified as \"atmospheric condition\" were the result of the victims performing activities that generated fumes or depleted the oxygen supply. The most common of these activities was welding in a confined space. Welding in a confined space was a major cause for explosions in areas that contained combustible gas , Chemical reactions forming flammable atmospheres occur when surfaces are initially exposed to the atmosphere, or when chemicals combine to form flammable gases. This condition arises when dilute sulfuric acid reacts with iron to form hydrogen or when calcium carbide makes contact with water to form acetylene.\nOther examples of spontaneous chemical reactions that may produce explosions from small amounts of unscompounds are acetylene-metal compounds, peroxides, and nitrates. In a dry state these compounds have the potential to explode upon percussion or exposure to increased temperature. Another class of chemical reactions that form flammable atmospheres arise from deposits of pyrophoric substances (carbon, ferrous oxide, ferrous sulfate, iron, etc) that can be found in tanks used by the chemical and petroleum industry. Th^se tanks containing flammable deposits, will spontaneously ignite upon exposure to air .\n cause explosions when the right air or oxygen to dust or gas mixture is present. Desorption of chemicals from the inner surfaces of a confined space is another process that may produce a flammable atmosphere. This is often a natural phenomenon in which the partial pressure at the interface between the surfaces and the stored chemical is radically reduced.\nFor example, after liquid propane is removed from a storage tank the walls of the vessel may desorb the remaining gas from the porous surface of the confined space.\nDorias  reported on an explosive gas-air mixture in a horizontal cylindrical container (1000 m, which had contained liquid propane.\nThe cylinder was emptied to check for stress cracking. The space was to be filled with water to expell the gas, and drained so it could automatically fill with normal air.\nThe container was presumably filled full of water and drained. The gas analysis of the resulting space showed an explosive gas-air mixture. The procedure of filling with water and draining was repeated and the test results were the same, an explosive gas-air mixture. To speed up the process, a man climbed into the cylinder and sprayed the interior with water for 3 hours, and allowed the interior to air dry.\nOn the 4th day, a mechanic entered the tank and prepared the areas to be inspected for stress. Following this, a m a n entered the tank with a test device and a Katel lamp (220 volts not of an explosion-proof design). There was a sudden explosion and flame streamed out of the entry manhole. The m a n who was testing the atmosphere suffered severe injuries from which he died 6 days later.\nInvestigation of the events revealed that the tanks were filled only 50% full the first time and only 80-90% full the second time. Therefore, it was concluded the space was never thoroughly emptied of all gas. Reconstruction of the operation showed that the spraying operation did not remove all the propane, and left a gas-air mixture of approximately 5% propane by volume, an extremely explosive condition .\n\n【18】 # (b) Toxic Atmospheres\nThe substances to be regarded as toxic in a confined space can cover the entire spectrum of gases, vapors, and finely-divided airborne dust in industry .\nThe sources of toxic atmospheres encountered may arise from the following:\n The manufacturing process (for example, in producing polyvinyl chloride, hydrogen chloride is used as well as vinyl chloride monomer which is carcinogenic).\n The product stored (removing decomposed organic material from a tank can liberate toxic substances such as H^S ) .\n The operation performed in the confined space (for example, welding or brazing with metals capable of producing toxic fumes).\nZavon  reported, in 1970, that four employees of a local utility were repairing a water meter in an underground vault 18 feet x 6 feet x 5 feet with an opening 24 inches in diameter. To make the repairs, it was necessary to cut 26 cadmium plated bolts with an oxygen propane torch.\nTwo men worked in the vault with one m a n cutting and the other standing beside him. Neither man wore a respirator and no ventilation was provided. Two other men remained on the surface. During the cutting of the bolts with the oxygen propane torch, a \"heavy blue smoke\" filled the vault.\nThis smoke was exhausted after the cutting was completed.\nThe 56-year-old m a n who had cut the bolts died 17 days after exposure. He became nauseated shortly after the job and was seen by his family physician the next day for fever (102-103 F ) , chest pain, cough, and sore throat. On the 4th day following the incident he was in greater distress and was hospitalized.\nDeath occurred in 2 weeks and was attributed to massive coronary infarction and corpulmonale. The 29-year-old assistant complained of chills, nausea, cough and difficulty in breathing.\nHe was treated for pneumonia and made a slow recovery. A reenactment of the work demonstrated that the exposure to cadmium was well above the threshold limit value of \"0.1 m g/ m 3 \" . Symptoms attributed to cadmium poisoning inclu\nThe injured frequently are well enough to work the day after exposure, but their conditions deteriorate until approximately the 5th day. At this point, the exposed worker will either get much worse or begin to improve .\nToxic gases may be evolved when acids are used for cleaning. Hydrochloric acid can react chemically w ith iron sulfide to produce hydrogen sulfide , Iron sulfide is formed on the walls of cooling jackets when only several parts per million sulfide are in the water used in the cooling p r o c e s s . As an example, 5 m e n were overcome while cleaning a heat exchanger using a hydrochloric acid solution .\n used in the tanning process.\nIf these two solutions (sodium sulfate and acid dichromate) are combined accidentally, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) will be produced.\nOne such incident occurred when several unused pits at a tannery were being cleaned. Sludge had formed on the bottom of the pit due to drainage from the hides when they had been treated with lime and acid dichromate. When men entered the pit to clear the drain line, they were overcome. Because of the high specific gravity of hydrogen sulfide, the gas formed by the sodium sulfide-dichromate reaction had settled in the pit, and when the sludge was stirred the released gas overcame the workers.\n cause a loss of reasoning, paralysis of the respiratory system, unconsciousness, and death .\n produce toxic gases which are not part of the planned operation.\nToxic solvents, which present problems , such as trichloroethylene, methyl chloroform, and dichloromethane, are used in industry for cleaning and degreasing.\nAcrylonitrile, infrequently used, has been encountered as an ingredient in a protective coating applied to tank interiors .\nTrichloroethane and dichloroethane are widely used in industry as cleaning solvents because they are among the least toxic of the chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons.\nThese solvents have been used as a replacement for carbon tetrachloride and trichloroethylene .\n known as methyl chloroform was substituted for trichloroethylene because of the high toxicity of the latter. A radiator and metal tank repairman was involved in an aircraft tip tank cleaning and assembly operation.\nThe technique of cleaning the interior of the tanks varied among workers. Some workmen would moisten a pad with solvent and would hand wipe the metal surfaces by reaching through an opening on the end of the tank; some would use pads on the end of a shaft, while others would climb inside and clean. One particular worker would saturate a pad with solvent and lower himself head first into the down-tilted tip of the tank and clean as fast as possible. This worker was found with his legs protruding from the upper end of the 450 gallon tank and was unresponsive. He was removed immediately and was given artificial respiration until a physician arrived and pronounced him dead.\nReconstruction of the fatal accident revealed the concentration of methyl chloroform in the tank had reached 62,000 ppm. The workers assumed that since the new cleaning solvent was less toxic than the one previously used, there was less danger. However, the new cleaning solvent, methyl chloroform, is a potent anesthetic at 30,000 ppm, which was less than half the concentration level in the worker's breathing zone.\nThe compatibility of materials must be considered when structural members and equipment are introduced in confined spaces. The previous history of the confined space must be carefully evaluated to avoid reactions with residual chemicals, wall scale, and sludge which can be highly reactive. One such case was reported in M a y of 1968, when an aluminum ladder was used for entry into a chemical evaporating tank which had contained aqueous sodium arsenite (Na As02 H  and sodium hydroxide (NaOH). The aluminum reacted with the NaAs02 dnd the NaOH to liberate hydrogen, which in turn reacted with the arsenic to form arsine ,\nOther cases of incompatability arise from the use of chemical cleaning agents. The initial step in chemical cleaning usually is the conversion of the scale or sludge into a liquid state which may cause poisonous gases to be liberated. In 1974, several employees who were cleaning a boiler tank prior to repairing a leak used a cleaning fluid, Vestan 675. The cleaning action caused the release of ammonia fumes that were not properly exhausted.\nThe m e n were hospitalized with severe chest pains, but recovered .\nAnother hazardous gas that may build up in a confined space is carbon monoxide (CO). This odorless colorless gas that has approximately the same density of air is formed from Incomplete combustion of organic materials such as wood, coal, gas, oil, and gasoline ; it can be formed from microbial decomposition of organic matter In sewers, silos, and fermentation tanks. Carbon monoxide is an insidious toxic gas because of Its poor warning properties.\nEarly stages of carbon monoxide intoxication are nausea and headache. Carbon monoxide m a y be fatal at 1000 ppm in air, and is considered dangerous at 200 ppm, because it forms carboxyhemoglobin in the blood which prevents the distribution of oxygen in the body.\n be noted that a safe reading on a combustible gas indicator does not ensure that CO is not present . Carbon monoxide must be tested for specifically.\nThe formation of CO m a y result from chemical reactions or work activities, therefore, fatalities due to CO poisoning are not confined to any particular industry.\nThere have been fatal accidents in sewage treatment plants  due to decomposition products and lack of ventilation in confined spaces. Another area where CO results as a product of decomposition is in the formation of silo gas in grain storage elevators . In another area, the paint industry, varnish is manufactured by introducing the various Ingredients into a kettle, and heating them in an inert atmosphere, usually town gas, which is a mixture of carbon dioxide and nitrogen.\nIn one accident report, a maintenance engineer entered a kettle that had been vented for 12-24 hours to check a blocked sampling tube. He was found dead some time later. Death was due to carbon monoxide poisoning. Investigation into the inert gas supply system revealed that the CO content of the town gas was over 1% , and that there were minor faults in the protective valves into the kettle so that a small leak was occurring. The employee had entered an atmosphere of reduced oxygen partial pressure containing CO and had succumbed before he could save himself .\nIn many cases CO poisoning occurs because of poor work practices.\nIn welding operations, oxides of nitrogen and ozone are gases of major toxicologic importance, and incomplete oxidation may occur and carbon monoxide can form as a byproduct . One such case, documented in the Pennsylvania Occupational Injury Files of 1975, involved an employee who was overcome by carbon monoxide while welding inside a copper heat-treating oven with the door partially closed.\nAnother poor w ork practice, which has led to fatalities, is the recirculation of diesel exhaust emissions .\nTests have shown that although the initial hazard due to exhaust toxicants may be from increased CO2 levels (or depleted 0  » the most immediate hazard to life processes is CO .\nIncreased CO levels can only be prevented by strict control of the ventilation or the use of catalytic convertors.\n\n【19】 # (c) Irritant (Corrosive) Atmosphere\nIrritant or corrosive atmospheres can be divided into primary and secondary groups. The primary irritants exert no systemic toxic effects because the products formed by them on tissues of the respiratory tract are non-irritant, and other Irritant effects are so violent as to obscure any systemic toxic action.\nExamples of primary irritants are chlorine (CI, ozone ( 0 , hydrochloric acid (HC, hydrofluoric acid (HF), sulfuric acid (H2S0^), nitrogen dioxide (NO , ammonia (NH, and sulfur dioxide (S. A secondary irritant is one that may produce systemic toxic effects in addition to surface irritation.\nExamples of secondary irritants Include benzene (C6He), carbon tetrachloride (CCl^ ) , ethyl chloride (CH3CH2CI), trichloroethane (CH^CCL, trichloroethylene (CHC1CC, and chloropropene (allyl chloride-CH2CHCH2C .\nIrritant gases vary widely among all areas of industrial activity. They can be found in plastics plants, chemical plants, the petroleum industry, tanneries, refrigeration industries, paint manufacturing, and mining operations .\nProlonged exposure at irritant or corrosive concentrations in a confined space m a y produce little or no evidence of irritation.\n\n【20】 # This has been interpreted\nto mean that the worker has become adapted to the harmful agent involved. In reality, it means there has been a general weakening of the defense reflexes from changes in sensitivity, due to damage of the nerve endings in the mucous membranes of the conjunctivae and upper respiratory tract.\nThe danger in this situation is that the worker is usually not aware of any increase in his exposure to toxic substances .\n\n【21】 # (d) Asphyxiating Atmosphere\nThe normal atmosphere is composed approximately of 20.9% oxygen and 78.1% nitrogen, and 1% argon with small amounts of various other gases. Reduction of oxygen ( in a confined space may be the result of either consumption or displacement .\nThe consumption of oxygen takes place during combustion of flammable substances, as in welding, heating, cutting, and brazing.\n be consumed during chemical reactions as in the formation of rust on the exposed surface of the confined space (iron oxide).\n influence the oxygen consumption rate.\n used as inerting agents to displace flammable substances and retard pyrophoric reactions. Gases such as nitrogen, argon, helium, and carbon dioxide, are frequently referred to as non-toxic inert gases but have claimed many lives . The use of nitrogen to inert a confined space has claimed more lives than carbon dioxide. The total displacement of oxygen by nitrogen will cause immediate collapse and death.\nCarbon dioxide and argon, with specific gravities of 1.53 and 1.38, respectively, (air =»  may lie in a tank or manhole for hours or days after opening . Since these gases are colorless and odorless, they pose an immediate hazard to health unless appropriate oxygen measurements and ventilation are adequately carried out.\nIn a report by the Ontario (Canada) Health Department, an underground oil storage tank which required cleaning, had been blanketed with nitrogen to prevent oxidation of the oil. The m a n assigned to clean the tank dropped an air hose into the tank before entering. As he reached the bottom of the ladder, he passed out.\nHis helper outside the tank went in to help and feeling faint, left without getting the man out. He went to get assistance from a nearby maintenance shop. Three m e n came to the tank and climbed down and all were overcome. Finally, after about 20 minutes, all four men were recovered with the help of the fire department. The only reason that there were no fatalities was that an airline in the tank was blowing air into the vicinity of the fallen workers .\nOxygen deprivation is one form of asphyxiation. While it is desirable to maintain the atmospheric oxygen level at 21% by volume, the body can tolerate deviation from this ideal. When the oxygen level falls to 17%, the first sign of hypoxia is a deterioration to night vision which is not noticeable until a normal oxygen concentration is restored. Physiologic effects are increased breathing volume and accelerated heartbeat. Between 14-16% physiologic effects are increased breathing volume, accelerated heartbeat, very poor muscular coordination, rapid fatigue, and intermittent respiration. Between\nthe effects are nausea, vomiting, inability to perform, and unconsciousness. Less than 6%, spasmatic breathing, convulsive movements, and death in minutes .\nIn discussing oxygen and what constitutes an oxygen deficient atmosphere from a physiologic view, one must address the concept of partial pressures. At sea level the normal atmospheric pressure for air (20.9% 0 2 + 78.1% N 2 + 1% Ar + trace amounts of various inert gases) is 14.7 psi or 760 m m Hg absolute. The partial pressure of 02 (P0¿) at sea level will be approximately 160 m m Hg. The concept of partial pressures is that in any mixture of gases, the total gas pressure is the sum of the partial pressures of all the gases .\nThe P 0 2 in ambient air can be decreased by a reduction in the 0 2 level at constant pressure or by maintaining the percentage of 0 2 constant and decreasing the total atmospheric pressure as in the case at high altitudes.\nIt is important not only to know the O 2 percent by volume, but to understand the relationship of 0 2 to altitude and the concept of partial pressure. For example, 20.9% 0 2 in air at sea level constitutes a greater P 0 2 than 20.9% 0â t 5,000 feet because the total atmospheric pressure at 5,000 feet is less. As the P 0 2 in the atmosphere drops, the volume of air required to maintain a P 0 2 of 60 m m Hg in the alveolar space of the lungs increases. A P 0 2 below 60 m m Hg in the alveolar space is considered oxygen deficient .\nAbsorption of oxygen by the vessel or the product stored therein is another mechanism by which the P 0 2 may be reduced and result in an oxygen deficient atmosphere. For example, activated carbon, usually considered as an innocuous material free of occupational hazard and toxicity, was responsible for two fatalities in a carbon filtration tank. Damp activated carbon absorbs oxygen and has been known to decrease the oxygen level from 21% to 4% in a closed vessel .\nMontgomery reported on two fatalities caused by the use of activated carbon in a water filtration vessel, (12.5 feet in diameter and 17 feet high).\nThe space was newly constructed, filled halfway with granular carbon in a slurry form (water m edium), the water was drained off through a bottom drain, and the tank was closed off to protect it from the weather. The next morning two workers entered the filtration vessel to perform necessary adjustment^ to the carbon bed and the interior sprinkler mechanism. When the workmen failed to appear at lunch time, they were found dead on the carbon bed.\nHowever, a rescuer entered the tank without any type of respiratory protection and with no ill affects. Tests of the atmosphere revealed no cause of death, the oxygen level was 21%, hydrocarbon and hydrogen sulfide tests were negative.\nThe investigation of the fatalities revealed the following: the tank was re-closed and re-opened the following day.\nNo toxic gases were found; however, the oxygen level had dropped from 21% to 12% by volume. Other vessels checked at this location which had been closed for several weeks revealed the oxygen level was down to 2%.\nIn summary, it was discovered that dry carbon would not reduce the oxygen level significantly. Damp activated carbon, however, supposedly an innocuous material and free from toxicity, contributed to the death of two workers as a result of selective absorption of oxygen in a confined space with no ventilation.\n\n【22】 # General Safety Hazards (a) Mechanical\nIf activation of electrical or mechanical equipment would cause injury, each piece of equipment should be manually isolated to prevent inadvertent activation before workers enter or while they work in a confined space. . The interplay of hazards associated with a confined space, such as the potential of flammable vapors or gases being present, and the build-up of static charge due to mechanical cleaning, such as abrasive blasting, all influence the precautions which must be taken.\nTo prevent vapoi^ leaks, flashbacks, and other hazards, workers should completely Isolate the space . To completely Isolate a confined space the closing of valves is not sufficient. All pipes must be physically disconnected or isolation blanks bolted in place .\nOther special precautions must be taken in cases where flammable liquids or vapors may recontaminate the confirmed space. The pipes blanked or disconnected should be inspected and tested for leakage to check the effectiveness of the procedure. Other areas of concern) are steam valves, pressure lines, and chemical transfer pipes.\nA less apparent hazard is the,space referred to as a void, such as double walled vessels, which must be given special consideration in blanking off and inerting.\n\n【23】 # (b) Communication Problems\nCommunication between the worker inside and the standby person outside is of utmost importance. If the worker should suddenly feel distressed and not be able to summon h e l p , an injury could become a fatality. Frequently, the body positions that are assumed in a confined space make it difficult for the standby person to detect an unconscious worker . When visual monitoring of the worker is not possible because of the design of the confined space or location of the entry hatch, a voice or alarm-activated explosion proof type of communication system will be necessary .\n\n【24】 # Suiillumination of an approved type is required to provide sufficient visibility for work in accordance with the recommendations made in the Illuminating Engineering Society Lighting Handbook.\n\n【25】 # (c) Entry and Exit\nEntry and exit time is of major significance as a physical limitation and is directly related to the potential hazard of the confined space. The extent of precautions taken and the standby equipment needed to maintain a safe work area will be determined by the means of access and rescue.\nThe following should be considered: type of confined space to be entered, access to the entrance, number and size of openings, barriers within the space, the occupancy load, and the time requirement for exiting in event of fire, or vapor incursion, and the time required to rescue injured workers .\n\n【26】 # (d) Physical\nThe hazards described in this section include non-chemical, physiologic stressors. These include thermal effects (heat and cold), noise, vibration, radiation, and fatigue while working in a confined space.\n Thermal Effects Four factors influence the interchange of heat between man and his environment.\nThey are:\n air temperature,  air velocity,  moisture contained in the air, and  radiant heat . Because of the nature and design of most confined spaces, moisture content and radiant heat are difficult to control.\nAs the body temperature rises progressively, workers will continue to function until the body temperature reaches 38.3 -39.4 C.\nWhen this body temperature is exceeded, the workers are less efficient, and are prone to heat exhaustion, heat cramps, or heat stroke . In a cold environment certain physiologic mechanisms come into play, which tend to limit heat loss and Increase heat production. The most severe strain In cold conditions Is chilling of the extremities so that activity Is restricted . Special precautions must be taken In cold environments to prevent frostbite, trench foot, and general hypothermia.\nProtective insulated clothing for both hot and cold environments will add additional bulk to the worker and must be considered in allowing for movement in the confined space and exit time.\nTherefore, air temperature of the environment becomes an important consideration when evaluating working conditions in confined spaces.\n Noise Noise problems are usually intensified in confined spaces because the interior tends to cause sound t o reverberate and thus expose the worker to higher sound levels than those found in an open environment. This intensified noise increases the risk of hearing damage to workers which could result in temporary or permanent loss of hearing. Noise in a confined space which may not be intense enough to cause hearing damage may still disrupt verbal communication with the emergency standby person on the exterior of the confined space. If the workers inside are not able to hear commands or danger signals due to excessive noise, the probability of severe accidents can increase .\n Vibration Wholebody vibration may be regarded as a \"generalized stressor\" and may affect multiple body parts and organs depending upon the vibration characteristics.\nSegmental vibration, unlike wholebody vibration, appears to be more localized in creating injury to the fingers and hands of workers using tools, such as pneumatic hammers, rotary grinders or other hand tools which cause vibration .\n General/Physical Some physical hazards cannot be eliminated because of the nature of the confined space or the work to be performed. These hazards include such items as scaffolding, surface residues, and structural hazards.\nThe use of scaffolding in confined spaces has contributed to many accidents caused by workers or materials falling, improper use of guard rails, and lack of maintenance to insure worker safety.\nThe choice of material used for scaffolding depends upon the type of work to be performed, the calculated weight to be supported, the surface on which the scaffolding is placed, and the substance previously stored in the confined space.\nSurface residues in confined spaces can Increase the already hazardous conditions of electrical shock, reaction of incompatible materials, liberation of toxic substances, and bodily injury due to slips and falls. Without protective clothing, additional hazards to health may arise due to surface residues.\nStructural hazards within a confined space such as baffles in horizontal tanks, trays in vertical towers, bends in tunnels, overhead structural members, or scaffolding installed for maintenance constitute physical hazards, which are exacerbated by the physical surroundings.\nIn dealing with structural hazards, workers must review and enforce safety precautions to assure safety.\nRescue procedures nay require withdrawal of an injured or unconscious person. Careful planning must be given to the relationship between the internal structure, the exit opening, and the worker. If the worker is above the opening, the system must include a rescue arrangement operated from outside the confined space, if possible, by which the employee can be lowered and removed without injury Statistical Data Accidents in confined spaces, like all others, are required by Federal regulations to be reported only if medical attention or loss of time from work, or death is involved. Some states and workers' compensation carriers have slightly more stringent requirements, but none require the reporting of incidents which can be considered near misses. The report by Safety Sciences prepared under contract for NIOSH  tended to show that fatalities occurred more frequently In confined spaces. For example, death by asphyxiation would be reported; however, if an employee experienced shortness of breath or dizziness, but managed to escape the confined space, and was not treated by a physican, this would probably not be a reported case.\nThe criteria used in selecting cases was based on the definition published in the Federal Register 42:213, November 4, 1977 and specific circumstances likely to be found on injury and fatality records.\nIII-l shows the number of \"events\", injuries, and fatalities from each data source. \"Events\" refers to the number of separate occasions in which one or more confined space-related injuries or illnesses occurred .\nIII-2 shows the number of events, injuries and fatalities obtained for each of the 15 basic accident and illness types which are described in  of this document. A total of 276 confined space related events were identified, which resulted In a total of 234 injuries and 193 fatalities. The shows that the most hazardous conditions in a confined space are a result of atmospheric related events .\nIII-3 shows the number of events by SIC code for each of the 15 confined space-related accident and illness types .\n\n【27】 # Previous Standards\nThe basis for most of the previous standards were safety codes-designed for specific industrial activities, and dealt with areas such as open surface tanks, welding and cutting, and the pulp and paper, and shipping industries.\nThe most recent standard published on confined spaces is the 12-year effort compiled by the American National Standards Institute, Z117. 1-1977. Despite the effort, the ANSI standard does not address the vitally important areas of training of personnel and specific recommendations for the safety equipment required in a confined space. All personal protective equipment is referenced to different ANSI Standards, which are broad based and do not address the specific problems of confined spaces.\n accepts the use of tagging as a reliable method of locking out a potentially hazardous situation.\nThe tagging system as a substitute for locking out all lines or pipes, or de-energizing systems of a confined space does not provide sufficient protection to the worker against accidental activation.\nThe ANSI Standard does mention the use of life lines; however, the only recommendation is for their use in an oxygen deficient atmosphere.\nThe General Industry Safety and Health Standards of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) address safety in confined spaces in over 50 different sections of 29 CFR 1910. The defining parameters of a confined space as given in the OSHA regulations are:\n limited means of exit,  a space subject to accumulation of toxic or flammable contaminants or,  one where an oxygen deficient atmosphere may develop. It includes but is not limited to such spaces as storage tanks, process vessels, bins, boilers and open top spaces more than 4 feet in depth. This is essentially the same definition used to establish the scope of this recommended criteria. However the \"Classification of open-surface tank operation\" (1910.94(d)  (i-ii)) differs from the classification system proposed in this document. This proposed classification system is Intended to apply to all confined spaces and is based upon the evaluation of several additional parameters. Such a classification will allow the application of a wider range of safety measures and ease the enforcement of the OSHA regulation.\nThe confined space classification system was designed to create a focal point by drawing together over 140 references in the OSHA standards. For example, the use of life lines in all confined spaces, has been addressed in this document and a solution to their excessive use has been proposed. The two documents agree on many areas of good work practices, such as the use of standby personnel, blanked-off lines, and main shutoff valves. Another area of agreement is the acceptance of 19.5% as the minimal oxygen level for safe work practice. There are some areas of the OSHA regulations that appear to accept tagging as a sufficient measure to ensure against opening of valves or energizing equipment during entry or while working in confined spaces. The proposed standard is more stringent in that only locking-out, blanking-off or disconnection are accep\n relies on the qualified person to make decisions for entry and necessary precautions for working in and for making emergency escape. A minimum safe level of oxygen for entry is not stated, only what is considered an oxygen deficient atmosphere (less than 17% by volume). The Australian Standard, which comes under the Factories' Regulations, states the confined space shall be emptied and flushed of hazardous substances and be ventilated with fresh air before entry. The Australian Standard is concerned primarily with entry and exit, not with isolation or safe oxygen level. The Australian Standard does; however, refer to a competent person similar to the qualified person for testing the atmosphere for flammable level. Other countries  published guidelines or standards for entering and working in confined spaces.\nMany of those reviewed follow recommendations similar to the Australian and Candadian standards.\n closely evaluated. The number of references involved prohibits the citing of each one, although valuable concepts were obtained.\n\n【28】 # Basis for the Recommended Standard\nWorkers who enter and work in confined spaces are confronted with many potentially hazardous conditions.\nThe hazards can range from an oxygen deficient atmosphere or liberation of a toxic agent, to mechanical equipment accidentally energized. The hazardous atmospheres that can be encountered in a confined space are; flammable, toxic, Irritant and/or corrosive, and asphyxiation. These atmospheric conditions are discussed in Chapter III, along with cited accident cases to emphasize the hazards involved with confined space entry.\nThe limited statistical data available on accidents and injuries directly related to confined spaces indicate a very high mortality level.\nThis disproportionately high mortality level for the number of reported accidents and injuries could be the result of Inadequate reporting methods, as not reporting a near miss with death, or data collection systems failing to list a confined space as a causative or other factor in traumatic accidents. In the accident and injury cases tabulated for this document, atmospheric conditions in confined spaces were responsible for the most frequent accident type in terms of events and number of persons killed or injured .\nThe work practices section in Chapter I of the recommended standard was developed after extensive review of published literature, 31,33,36, the current Federal, State, and local applicable codes, , international codes or recommendations 102], and site visits to facilities where working in confined spaces is part of the industrial activity.\n\n【29】 # (a) Testing and Monitoring\nPrior to entry into a confined space, workers should know the space's potential hazards. Deaths have occurred because a presumably safe space was not tested prior to initial entry . The various tests to be performed prior to entry shall include tests for flammability, toxic agents, oxygen deficiency, and harmful physical agents. Specific instruments are required for testing the atmosphere for flammability, oxygen deficiency, carbon monoxide, and physical agents. For example, combustible gas Indicators are designed for the purpose of measuring the concentration of flammable gases, and will not measure or indicate the presence of carbon monoxide at toxic levels, conversely a carbon monoxide detector Is designed for the measurement of carbon monoxide only. It should be noted that combustible gas indicators respond differently to different flammable hydrocarbons and should be calibrated for the specific contaminant if known.\nThe flammability measurement may be erroneous if the oxygen level is less or greater than normal atmospheric concentrations.\nTherefore, it is recommended that the oxygen level be determined prior to flammability testing to make any necessary corrections in the flammability measurement.\n\n【30】 # When\nthe materials may form a combustible dust mixture, special precautions must be taken to prevent an explosive atmosphere from developing. There are numerous instruments available for measuring airborne dust concentrations; however, none appear to have automatic alarm systems and would require constant personal monitoring.\nThe only practical approach to the control of combustible dusts is to eliminate the hazard by preventive measures, such as,  engineering controls,  good housekeeping,  elimination of ignition sources,  isolation of dust producing operations and,  training and education of the employees.\nThe oxygen deficiency measuring instrument is designed to measure the volume of oxygen present, usually scaled with a range of 0.0-25%.\nIf the percentage of oxygen in a confined space atmosphere is less than 19.5% or greater than 25%, special precautions, as determined by the qualified person, shall be taken.\nIn accordance with OSHA Safety and Health Standard 29 CFR Part 1910 and other references , a minimum oxygen level of 19.5% has been adopted for worker safety. The upper oxygen limit has been set at 25% because an increase above this level will greatly increase the rate of combustion of flammable materials .\nContinuous and/or frequent monitoring becomes necessary in cases where the work being performed within the confined space has the potential of generating toxic agents . Data collected for NIOSH by Safety Sciences  shows that in 28 out of 80 accident events, the toxic gas or oxygen deficiency was not in the confined space at the time of entry, but was either generated by the work occurring in the space, or by gas being unexpectedly admitted into the confined space after the worker had entered. In these cases, only continuous and/or frequent monitoring would be a possible countermeasure.\n\n【31】 # (b) Medical\nMedical requirements for workers who might enter a confined space should take into consideration the increased hazard potential of confined spaces. In this setting, the workers must rely more heavily upon their physical, mental, and sensory attributes, especially under emergency conditions. Workers should be evaluated by competent medical personnel to insure that they are physically and mentally able to wear respirators under simulated and actual working conditions.\nBecause of the additional stress placed on the cardiopulmonary system, some pathologic conditions, such as cardiovascular diseases or those associated with hypoxemia, should preclude the use of respiratory protective devices .\nIn areas where the hazard potential is high, a person certified in CPR and first aid should be in attendance. Since irreversible brain damage can occur in approximately 4 minutes in an oxygen deficient atmosphere, it is essential that resuscitation attempts occur within that time .\n(c) Safety Equipment and Clothing Many cases of accidental dermal exposure, respiratory distress, and traumatic injury due to falling objects have occurred in confined spaces; therefore, a general safety standard should address the problem of whole body protection . Another area of concern is the use of life lines in all confined spaces. Part of the recommended standard should be an evaluation of the confined space to define when life lines shall be used and when a safety belt with D rings for attaching life lines would be sufficient .\n\n【32】 # (d) Training\nTraining of employees for entering and working in confined spaces is essential because of the potential hazards and the use of life saving equipment. To insure worker safety, the training program should be especially designed for the type of confined space involved and the problems associated with entry and exit.\nIf different types of confined spaces are involved, this will require additional training.\nAreas that should be covered in an effective training program are:\nEmergency entry and exit procedures 2.\nUse of applicable respiratory equipment 3.\nFirst Aid and Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) 4.\nLockout procedures 5.\nSafety equipment use 6.\nRescue drills 7.\n\n【33】 # Fire protection 8. Communications\nTraining of employees should be done by the qualified person or someone knowledgeable in all relevant aspects of confined space entry, hazard recognition, use of safety equipment, and rescue .\nFor training to be effective, classroom sessions, on-the-job training, or simulated conditions, appear to be the most satisfactory methods.\nClassroom sessions should include all applicable Federal, state, and local regulations that govern the specific industrial activity in which the employee will be working, as well as the hazards of a confined space (physical and chemical). The training guidelines in Chapter V can be used as a format for additional classroom activity.\nOn-the-job training should be closely supervised until the employee has a complete understanding of all potential hazards. Testing of the employee should take place to evaluate the person's competency and determine if retraining is necessary.\n Purging and ventilation -poor natural ventilation is one of the defining parameters of a confined space, therefore purging and mechanical ventilation must be closely evaluated when safe work practices are developed for entering and working in confined spaces. Purging is the initial step in adjusting the atmosphere in a confined space to accepstandards (PGL's, LEL's, and LFL's). This is accomplished either by displacing the atmosphere in the confined space with fluid or vapor (inert gas, water, steam and/or cleaning solution), or by forced air ventilation. According to the literature  20 air changes should bring the atmosphere in the confined space into equilibrium with the external environment.\nAfter purging, one establishes general and/or local exhaust ventilation to maintain a safe uncontaminated level. Guidelines for establishing ventilation rates are referenced in the ANSI Standard Z9. 2-1972  and NIOSH Recommended Industrial Ventilation Guidelines  . In addition, other information applicable to the special problems of confined spaces must be considered such as the Occupational Safety and Health Standard 29 CFR 1915.31(b) .\nEntering into an inert atmosphere is one of the most hazardous activities associated with working in a confined space. Work in an inert atmosphere is usually performed by employees of companies who specialize in this because of the high degree of training and expertise needed to perform inert entry operations safely. The scope of this document deals with the necessary precautions but does not cover the specialized training for entry into a confined space containing an inert atmosphere .\n Isolation/Lockout/Tagging -a review of the statistical data provided to NIOSH  demonstrated an obvious need for lockout procedures. The use of tags, while valuable for identification and/or information purposes, appears to have been inadequate in preventing accidents.\nA review of the literature has shown that proper isolation and lockout procedures are more effective than tagging .\n Cleaning -decontaminating a space by cleaning is necessary to provide for worker safety. However, it must be recognized that the cleaning process itself can generate additional hazards. Continuous and/or frequent monitoring is required during this process to determine that flammable mixtures and hazardous concentrations of contaminants are adequately diluted before safe entry can be made .\n Equipment and tools -the literature reviewed , has shown the potential for explosion is greatly increased when explosion proof equipped tools and equipment are not used or improperly maintained. Also the potential for electrocution is increased when low voltage or ground fault circuit interrupters are not used.\n Permit System -the inherent dangers associated with a confined space clearly indicate the need for strict control measures of employees and equipment.\nThe literature has shown  that the use of a permit system is a very effective method of attaining control.\nThe permit provides written authorization for entering and working in confined spaces, clearly states all known or potential hazards, and identifies the safety equipment required to insure the safety of the worker.\n(e ) Work P r a c t i c e s  Entry and Rescue -the potential hazards associated with a confined space must be evaluated prior to entry. These hazards would include the following: oxygen level, flammability characteristics, toxic agents, and physical hazards ie, limited openings and communications. To simplify entry and rescue it would appear logical to set up a classification for easy reference. The literature reviewed  has provided necessary information to set up an entry classification and allow for flexibility in the selection of personal protective equipment.\nIt is essential that well planned rescue procedures and the proper use of personal protective equipment be followed. The literature and data reviewed have shown a very poor record in successful rescue efforts. Spontaneous reaction instead of well planned and executed rescue procedures has led to multiple fatalities in confined spaces. In 19 of the 25 cases in which rescue was attempted, the rescuers were injured or killed. These cases resulted in 13 deaths and 30 injuries to rescuers, even though only 5 victims were successfully saved. One particular case resulted in injury to 15 rescuers; however, they were successful in saving 3 lives . Therefore, the standby and/or rescue team shall be properly equipped and trained in all aspects of rescue.\n Recordkeeping -from a review of the limited data available (no SIC code for confined spaces) and the information collected from the plant site visits on accidents in confined spaces, it is apparent that recordkeeping systems must be changed to identify areas where accidents occur, so that underlying causes can be determined. The records to be kept by the employer should contain such information as employee name, age, training, job description, number of years on the job, accident location and severity, underlying causes, and action taken to insure future worker safety.\n\n【34】 # V. TRAINING GUIDELINES\nThe very nature of the hazards encountered in a confined space is of paramount importance in structuring an effective training program which will provide for safe work practices and techniques. The training program should be based on the specific hazards to be encountered, approved by a trained safety person and given to all individuals who will perform the work or may be assigned as standby or rescue persons.  Orientation of all new employees. This type of training would consist of classroom sessions along with a walk-through of the physical plant layout to give the trainee a basic understanding of the Industrial activity.\n On-the-job training. This would be a second phase of training. After classroom sessions and after the trainee has gained a basic understanding of the operation and hazards involved, on-the-job instruction should include observation and closely supervised participation in actual work practices or simulated conditions.\n Retraining.\nThis should be performed periodically and as frequently as needed.\n be considered necessary if a supervisor notices a weakness in employee performance.\n\n【35】 # (c) Training Evaluation\nThe effectiveness of the training program can be determined of the employee by the qualified person to see if safe work being followed, testing the employee for knowledge of the haza r d s , and a reduction in the accident rate due to safe work techniques which have been learned and are being practiced.\n\n【36】 # (d) Training Program\nThe work practices section presented in Chapter I was designed to set a formalized standard that could, when complied with, eliminate or minimize accidents and injuries occurring in confined spaces. The standard would not be sufficient without a formal written training program and job planning to convey safe work practices and their relationship to the entire operation.\nThe employer is responsible for ensuring that each employee is adequately trained and given refresher courses in assigned duties, and that the employee understands and applies safe work practices. The following are recommended areas that should be covered thoroughly in training:\n The types of confined spaces that are found in the industrial complex. This should cover physical location, size, and any pertinent information that would inform the worker of its function.\n Physical and chemical hazards involved. The physical hazards would include structural members within a confined space, equipment that will be used, eg, scaffolding or ladders, size of openings, flooring, and other. Chemical hazards discussed will cover the product which has been stored, chemical cleaners used, and air contaminants which can be liberated due to the work practices.\n Atmospheric testing of the confined space. This phase of the instruction should emphasize the contaminants which should be tested for and the safe levels for entry.  Ventilation of the space by mechanical methods to reduce or eliminate toxic airborne contaminants. This category should be covered sufficiently to alert the employee of potential hazards, and the need for warning devices to signal when there is a ventilation failure.\n Isolation and lockout of the confined space. The worker should be able to recognize a hazard by visual observation of the connecting lines to a confined space. The lockout of electrical circuits and mechanical disconnects to complete confined space isolation should be explained as should the employees' responsibilities in this area. This should include the type of protective shoes, gloves, face protection, protective clothing, head protection, and safety belts and harnesses that are to be worn as well as the rationale for their use. A major area in this section will be the use of respirators:\nthe types required, their use, quantitative fit (test), respirator cleaning procedures, and proper storage. It should be emphasized that different type respirators are required for different atmospheres and the dangers involved when the wrong type is used . The mandatory wearing of safety belts should be stressed. The use of safety belts and harnesses should be demonstrated so that each individual understands the importance of having the rescue system available, and operative, and is constantly aware of the necessity of keeping life lines clear to the point of exit. Satisfactory completion of this safety training, and refresher courses, should be entered into the employee's permanent record.\n\n【37】 # V I. RESEARCH NEEDS\nThe primary research need in the area of confined spaces is the development of a data system that would have the capability of recording injury and mortality information specific to the causative factor eg, confined space and be readily accessible.\nIt is now impossible to retrieve data directly related to confined space injuries and mortality, since data are currently collected by general classifications, such as SIC codes.

These data are essential to the proper evaluation of the causes of injuries and deaths.\n provide a background for analyzing unusual accidents to establish causal factors and prevent recurrence.\nA final step that would be accomplished by an approved data base on confined spaces would be to standardize the degree of hazards throughout industry and provide justification for a uniform standard. This uniform standard would serve as the basis for a training program, which could be tailored to meet the needs of large as well as small industries.\nThe second area of research needed is development of more adequate methods for preventing and detecting gas leaks into confined spaces.\nMany accidents have occurred because the atmosphere in a confined space, which was presumed to be safe by the nature of the contents or obvious safe history of the confined space, had suddenly become lethal.\nHistorical cases reported have shown that faulty seals in storage or processing vessels may allow seepage from an external source, which could be naturally lethal or could form a lethal substance when combined with residual material in the tank.\nA third area for research is the analytical devices used in confined spaces, such as Intrinsically safe continuous monitors for gases as well as explosive dusts, personal dosimeters, and test meters designed to withstand rugged field use and maintain their integrity.\nIt becomes difficult to calibrate a gas detection meter after continued field use and to be sure of its accuracy.

Several conditions may contribute to the pathophysiology of high LDL, such as diet high in saturated fat, hypothyroidism, nephrotic syndrome, pregnancy, obesity, or medications such as amiodarone, cyclosporine, diuretics, and glucocorticoids.  Prior approaches to the management of LDL aimed towards the classification of LDL concentrations and the treatment of subjects with dyslipidemia to a target LDL concentration.  In 2001, the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III classified LDL concentrations into optimal, near optimal, borderline high, high, and very high.

However, the study of lipids in the blood has started early in the 1900's. In 1949, Faraday Society in Birmingham organized the first symposium on lipoproteins and separated for the first time lipoproteins into alpha and beta types.  In 1950, LDL was first isolated.  In 1973, Myant first hypothesized the role of LDL in the metabolism of cholesterol.\n\n【3】 # Classification\nPrior approaches to the management of LDL aimed towards the classification of LDL concentrations and the treatment of subjects with dyslipidemia to a target LDL concentration.

Its size is approximately 22 nm but since LDL particles contain a changing number of fatty acids they actually have a mass and size distribution. Each native LDL particle contains a single apolipoprotein B-100 molecule (Apo B-100, a protein with 4536 amino acid residues) that surrounds the fatty acids keeping them soluble in the aqueous environment.  The average composition of LDL is approximately 20% protein, 20% phospholipids, 40% cholesteryl esters, 10% unesterified cholesterol, and 5% triglycerides.\n\n【5】 # Pathophysiology\nEnvironmental and genetic factors are involved in the pathophysiology of high LDL.  Several conditions may contribute to the pathophysiology of high LDL, such as diet high in saturated fat, hypothyroidism, nephrotic syndrome, pregnancy, obesity, or medications such as amiodarone, cyclosporine, diuretics, and glucocorticoids.  Abnormally low LDL can occur, and they usually result from rare inherited conditions, such as familial hypobetalipoproteinemia and abetalipoproteinemia.\n\n【6】 # Causes\n\n【7】 ## Low LDL\nLow LDL levels can be caused by unusual inherited disorders of lipoprotein metabolism such as abetalipoproteinemia and hypobetalipoproteinemia.\n\n【8】 ## High LDL\n be caused by inherited diseases that affect the lipid metabolism.\n\n【9】 # Epidemiology and Demographics\nFrom 1976–1980 through 2007–2010, for U.S. adults aged 40–74, a decrease was observed in the prevalence of high LDL-cholesterol (LDL–C) from 59% to 28%, as well as an increase in adults using lipid-lowering medications and consuming a diet low in saturated fat. Despite recent advances in medical treatment, high LDL-C remains a significant public health problem in the United States, with more than one-quarter of adults aged 40–74 having high LDL–C.\n\n【10】 # Risk Factors\nRisk factors for high LDL include genetic predisposition, aging, and unhealthy life style choices.\n\n【11】 # Screening\nAccording to the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), screening for high LDL-cholesterol (LDL-c), is indicated among men 35 years and older (Gra\n\n【12】 # Natural History, Complications and Prognosis\n been validated.

The 2013 ACC/AHA guidelines identifies the following statin benefit groups: subjects with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, subjects with LDL ≥ 190 mg/dL, subjects with diabetes mellitus PLUS age 40-75 years PLUS LDL 10-189 mg/dL, and subjects with LDL 70-189 mg/dL PLUS estimated 10 year risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease ≥ 7.5%.

First language acquisition concerns the development of language in children, while second language acquisition focuses on language development in adults as well. Historically, theorists are often divided between emphasising either nature or nurture  Nature versus nurture) as the most important explanatory factor for acquisition.\nOne hotly debated issue is whether the biological contribution includes capacities specific to language acquisition, often referred to as universal grammar. For fifty years, linguists Noam Chomsky and the late Eric Lenneberg argued for the hypothesis that children have innate, language-specific abilities that facilitate and constrain language learning.\nOther researchers, including Elizabeth Bates, Catherine Snow, and Michael Tomasello, have hypothesized that language learning results only from general cognitive abilities and the interaction between learners and their surrounding communities. Recent work by William O'Grady proposes that complex syntactic phenomena result from an efficiency-driven, linear computational system. O'Grady describes his work as \"nativism without Universal Grammar.\" One of the most important advances in the study of language acquisition was the creation of the CHILDES database by Brian MacWhinney and Catherine Snow.\n\n【1】 # Nativist theories\nNativist theories hold that children are born with an innate propensity for language acquisition, and that this ability makes the task of learning a first language easier than it would otherwise be. These \"hidden assumptions\"  allow children to quickly out what is and isn't possible in the grammar of their native language, and allow them to master that grammar by the age of three.  Nativists view language as a fundamental part of the human genome, as the trait that makes humans human, and its acquisition as a natural part of maturation, no different from dolphins learning to swim or songbirds learning to sing.\nChomsky originally theorized that children were born with a hard-wired language acquisition device (LAD) in their brains . He later expanded this idea into that of Universal Grammar, a set of innate principles and adjusparameters that are common to all human languages. According to Chomsky, the presence of Universal Grammar in the brains of children allow them to deduce the structure of their native languages from \"mere exposure\".\n seem remarkably immune from error correction by adults, which Nativists say would not be the case if children were learning from their parents.\nThe possible existence of a Critical Period for language acquisition is another Nativist argument. Critical periods are time frames during which environmental exposure is needed to stimulate an innate trait. Young chaffinches, for example, must hear the song of an adult chaffinch before reaching maturity, or else would never be able to sing. Nativists argue that if a Critical Period for language acquisition exists  below), then language acquisition must be spurred on by the unfolding of the genome during maturation.\nLinguist Eric Lenneberg stated in 1964 that the crucial period of language acquisition ends around the age of 12 years. He claimed that if no language is learned before then, it could never be learned in a normal and fully functional sense. This was called the \"Critical period hypothesis.\"\nDetractors Template:Who of the \"Critical Period Hypothesis\" say that in this example and others like it  Feral children), the child is hardly growing up in a nurturing environment, and that the lack of language acquisition in later life may be due to the results of a generally abusive environment rather than being specifically due to a lack of exposure to language. The \"Critical Period\" theory of brain plasticity and learning capacity has been called into question. Other factors may account for differences in adult and child language learning. Children’s apparently effortless and rapid language acquisition may be explained by the fact that the environment is set up to engage them in frequent and optimal learning opportunities. By contrast, adults seem to have an initial advantage in their learning of vocabulary and syntax, but may never achieve native-like pronunciation.\nA more up-to-date view of the Critical Period Hypothesis is represented by the University of Maryland, College Park instructor Robert DeKeyser. DeKeyser argues that although it is true that there is a critical period, this does not mean that adults cannot learn a second language perfectly, at least on the syntactic level. DeKeyser talks about the role of language aptitude as opposed to the critical period.\n discovered some 300 adults who, despite being raised in otherwise healthy environments, had never acquired language, and turned out to be incapable of learning language in any meaningful sense. While it was possible to teach vocabulary, these individuals were unable to learn syntax.\nDerek Bickerton's  landmark work with Hawaiian pidgin speakers studied immigrant populations where first-generation parents spoke highly-ungrammatical \"pidgin English\". Their children, Bickerton found, grew up speaking a grammatically rich language -- neither English nor the  syntax-less pidgin of their parents. Furthermore, the language exhibited many of the underlying grammatical features of many other natural languages. The language became \"creolized\", and is known as Hawaii Creole English. This was taken as powerful evidence for children's innate grammar module.\nDebate within the nativist position now revolves around how language evolved. Derek Bickerton suggests a single mutation, a \"big bang\", linked together previously evolved traits into full language. Others like Steven Pinker argue for a slower evolution over longer periods of time.\n\n【2】 # Criticism and Non-Nativist Theories\nNon-nativist theories include Relational Frame Theory, the competition model, functionalist linguistics, usage-based language acquisition,  social interactionism and others. Social-interactionists, like Snow, theorize that adults play an important part in children's language acquisition. However, some researchers claim that the empirical data on which theories of social interactionism are based have often been over-representative of middle class American and European parent-child interactions. Various anthropological studies of other human cultures, as well as anecdotal evidence from western families, suggests rather that many, if not the majority, of the world's children are not spoken to in a manner akin to traditional language lessons, but nevertheless grow up to be fully fluent language users. Many researchers now take this into account in their analyses.\nNevertheless, Snow's criticisms might be powerful against Chomsky's argument, if the argument from the poverty of stimulus were indeed an argument about degenerate stimulus, but it is not. The argument from the poverty of stimulus is that there are principles of grammar that cannot be learned on the basis of positive input alone, however complete and grammatical that evidence is. This argument is not vulnerable to objection based on evidence from interaction studies such as Snow's, but it is vulnerable to the clear evidence of the availability of negative input given by Conversational analysis. In addition, meta analysis has shown that there is a large amount of corrections made . Meork  conducted a meta-analysis of 40 studies and found substantial evidence that corrections do indeed play a role. From this work, corrections are not only abundant but contingent on the mistakes of the child.  behavior analysis of child development ).\nMany criticisms of the basic assumptions of generative theory have been put forth, with little response from its champions. The concept of LAD is unsupported by evolutionary anthropology which shows a gradual adaptation of the human body to the use of language, rather than a sudden appearance of a complete set of binary parameters (which are common to digital computers but not to neurological systems such as a human brain) delineating the whole spectrum of possible grammars ever to have existed and ever to exist.\nThe theory has several hypothetical constructs, such as movement, empty categories, complex underlying structures, and strict binary branching, that cannot possibly be acquired from any amount of input. Since the theory is, in essence, unlearnably complex, then it must be innate. A different theory of language, however, may yield different conclusions. Examples of alternative theories that do not utilize movement and empty categories are Head-driven phrase structure grammar, Lexical functional grammar, and several varieties of Construction Grammar. While all theories of language acquisition posit some degree of innateness, a less convoluted theory might involve less innate structure and more learning. Under such a theory of grammar, the input, combined with both general and language-specific learning capacities, might be sufficient for acquisition. Relational Frame Theory (Hayes, Barnes-Holmes, Roche, , provides a wholly selectionist/learning account of the origin and development of language competence and complexity.  Bolstered by a significant and growing base of experimental and applied research, RFT posits a \"functional contextualist\" approach to the understanding, prediction and control of language phenomenon.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Infestation usually leads to intense itching in the pubic area. Treatment with topic agents such as permethrin or pyrethrin with piperonyl butoxide is exceedingly effective. Worldwide it affects about 2% of the population.\n\n【2】 # Historical Perspective\n- Pediculosis pubis was reported in the literature as early as 1946.\n- In 1946, Andrew G. Franks describes the use of DDT in the treatment of pediculosis pubis.\n\n【3】 # Classification\nInfestation with pubic lice may be classified according to the site affected into:\n- Phthiriasis pubis: infestation of pubic hair with pubic lice\n- Phthiriasis palpebrarum: infestation of eyelashes with pubic lice\n\n【4】 # Pathophysiology\n\n【5】 ## Transmission\nPubic lice are usually acquired by intimate contact between individuals. Parent-to-child infestations are more likely to occur through routes of shared towels, clothing, beds or closets. Adults are more frequently infested than children. As with most sexually transmitted pathogens, they can only survive a short time away from the warmth and humidity of the human body. Infection in a young child is not necessarily indicative of sexual abuse, although this possibility should be kept in mind.\n\n【6】 ## Life Cycle\nPubic lice (Phthirus pubis) have three stages: egg, nymph and adult. Eggs (nits) are laid on a hair shaft. Females will lay approximately 30 eggs during their 3–4 week life span. Eggs hatch after about a week and become nymphs, which look like smaller versions of the adults. The nymphs undergo three molts  before becoming adults. Adults are 1.5–2.0 mm long and flattened. They are much broader in comparison to head and body lice. Adult lice are found only on the human host and require human blood to survive. If adults are forced off the host, they will die within 24–48 hours without a blood feeding. Pubic lice are transmitted from person to person most-commonly via sexual contact, although fomites (bedding, clothing) may play a minor role in their transmission.\n\n【7】 ## Macroscopic Characteristics\n called a nit), the nymph, and the adult.\n- N\n- Nymph: The nymph is an immature louse that hatches from the nit (egg). A nymph looks like an adult pubic louse but it is smaller. To live, a nymph must feed on blood. It takes 2–3 weeks after hatching to mature into adults capable of reproducing.\n- Adult: The adult pubic louse resembles a miniature crab when viewed through a strong magnifying glass. Pubic lice have six legs; their two front legs are very large and look like the pincher claws of a crab. This is how they got the nickname \"crabs.\" Pubic lice are tan to grayish-white in color. Females lay nits and are usually larger than males. To live, lice must feed on blood. If the louse falls off a person, it dies within 1–2 days.\n\n【8】 # Causes\nThe cause of pubic lice is pediculus pubis. For more information about the microorganism, click here.\n\n【9】 # Differentiating Pediculosis pubis from other Diseases\nPediculosis pubis must be differentiated from other diseases that cause pruritus and excoriation in the pubic area:\n\n【10】 # Epidemiology and Demographics\n- The incidence of pubic lice worldwide is estimated at 2,000 per 100,000 cases.\n- Accurate numbers are difficult to acquire, because pubic lice infestations are not considered a reporcondition by many governments, and many cases are self-treated or treated discreetly by personal physicians.\n- It has recently been suggested that an increasing percentage of humans removing their pubic hair has led to  reduced crab louse populations in some parts of the world.\n\n【11】 # Risk Factors\nSexual contact with a person infected with pubic lice is a risk factor for its transmission.\n\n【12】 # Natural History, Complications and Prognosis\n\n【13】 ## Natural History\nIf left untreated, infestation with pubic lice may persist and lead to secondary bacterial infection due to the associated intense itching.\n\n【14】 ## Complications\nMost common complication of pubic lice infestation is excoriations due to intense itching, which may lead to a secondary bacterial infection. When pediculus pubis infests the eyelashes, it may lead to eye infections, such as blepharitis and conjunctivitis.\n\n【15】 ## Prognosis\nWith proper medical treatment with antimicrobial drugs, pediculosis pubis has an excellent prognosis.\n\n【16】 # Screening\nThere are no screening recommendations for pubic lice. \n\n【17】 # History and Symptoms\n be found in hair on the abdomen and under the armpits as well as on the beard and mustache, while in children they are usually found in eyelashes. Infestation with pubic lice is called Phthiriasis or Pediculosis pubis, while infestation of eyelashes with pubic lice is called Phthriasis palpebrarum .\n- The main symptom is itching, usually in the pubic hair area. It results from hypersensitivity to louse saliva, and it becomes strong enough 2 or more weeks following initial infestation.\n- Erythematous sore lesions may be seen due to scratching.\n characteristic for the infestation.\n\n【18】 # Physical Examination\nSkin examination in patients with pubic lice may reveal the following findings:\n- Visualization of the pubic lice and their nits in the pubic area. Other sites that may be affected include the perianal and inguinal areas, axillary and chest hair, as well as the eyelashes.\n- Papular urticaria\n- Excoriations, which may become secondarily infected\n- Maculae cerulea: a pathognomonic finding for pubic lice. These are blue-gray, irregularly shaped macules, which measure 0.5-1 cm in diameter and are usually scattered over the lower abdomen, buttocks and upper thighs.\n- Inguinal lymphadenopathy\n\n【19】 # Laboratory Findings\nThe diagnosis of pubic lice is made by visualization of lice on pubic hair and there are no laboratory findings associated with pubic lice.\n\n【20】 # Other Diagnostic Studies\nDiagnosis of pediculosis pubis is made through direct visualization of the lice on pubic hair.\n\n【21】 # Medical Therapy\n- Generally, all patients with Pediculosis pubis require antimicrobial therapy.\n- Randomized clinical data that compares the efficacy and safety of antimicrobial therapies is scarce.\n- The majority of trials that evaluate therapies for Pediculosis pubis are based on the management of head lice.\n- Phthirus pubis therapy\n- Preferred regimen : Permethrin 1% cream rinse applied to affected areas and washed off after 10 minutes\n- Preferred regimen : Pyrethrin with piperonyl butoxide applied to the affected area and washed off after 10 minutes\n- Alternative regimen : Malathion 0.5% lotion applied to affected areas and washed off after 8–12 hours\n- Alternative regimen : Ivermectin 250 ug/kg PO, may be repeated in 1-2 weeks\n- Note : If Malathion lotion is to be applied to hair, the hair should be dry. In contrast, Permethrin should be applied to wet hair.\n- Note : If necessary, treatment may be repeated after 1 week.\n- Note : Permethrin may be safe among pregnant women, but randomized data is lacking.\n\n【22】 ## Specific Considerations\n\n【23】 ### Eyelashes\nRecommended regimens should not be applied to the eyes. Apply occlusive ophthalmic ointment or petroleum jelly to the eyelid margins 2 times/day for 10 days\n\n【24】 ### Pregnancy\n- Preferred regimen : Permethrin 1% cream rinse applied to affected areas and washed off after 10 minutes\n- Preferred regimen : Pyrethrin with piperonyl butoxide applied to the affected area and washed off after 10 minutes\n- Ivermectin may be used. No teratogenicity has been observed so far in humans, so it remains as low risk during pregnancy and probably compatible during breastfeeding. Despite that, give preference to the other drugs.\n\n【25】 ## Non-Pharmacologic Management\n- Clothes should be decontaminated by laundering at temperatures > 50 C.\n\n【26】 ## Treatment of Sexual Partners\n- Pubic lice may be spread through sexual intercourse.\n- Therefore, all partners with whom the patient has had sexual contact within the previous 30 days should be evaluated and treated, and sexual contact should be avoided until all partners have successfully completed treatment and are thought to be cured.\n- Because of the strong association between the presence of pubic lice and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), patients diagnosed with pubic lice should undergo evaluation for other STIs.\n\n【27】 # Surgery\nThere is no role for surgery in the treatment of pubic lice.\n\n【28】 # Primary Prevention\nAbstaining from sexual intercourse with an infected person is one of the means of preventing infestation with pubic lice.\n\n【29】 # Secondary Prevention\nOnce a patient is diagnosed with pubic lice, the following preventive measures may be followed:\n- Washing with hot water and drying of all clothes and bedding\n- Promoting personal hygiene and sanitation measures\n- Treatment of sexual contacts with pubic lice\n- Examining patients and their sexual partners for other STDs.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

The economic burden of OA for United States economy is more than $60 billion per year; which has more economic pressure than rheumatoid arthritis. This cost can be considered into two subgroups: the medical related costs and the lost expediency of patients at work \n\n【2】 # Historical Perspective\nThe earliest descriptions of OA were provided by Heberden and Haygarth in the 19th century. In the 1930s and 1940s, Dr. Stecher showed that there were two forms of OA: idiopathic and post-traumatic.  In the 1950s, the connection between Heberden’s nodes and large joint OA were revealed by Kellgren and Moore. In this regard, the first x-ray grading system for OA was developed by Jonas Kellgren and John Lawrence in the 1950s. Surgical management of OA was developed in the 1960s by Drs. Charnley and McKee \n\n【3】 # Classification\nOsteoarthritis is radiographically classified depending on the degree of joint involvement. The Kellgren-Lawrence is a common method to classify the severity of OA in the knee using five different grades. This classification was proposed by Kellgren in 1957 and was then accepted by WHO in 1961 \n\n【4】 # Pathophysiology\nOsteoarthritis (OA) is a well-known degenerative joint disease influencing millions of people worldwide. Osteoarthritis is a complex disease caused by changes in the tissues' homeostasis of articular cartilages and subchondral bones. The cell/extracellular matrix (ECM) and their interactions play an important role in the pathophysiology of articular cartilage and the occurrence of Osteoarthritis. Consequently, the main feature of OA is that after this process is involved, the articular cartilages of the involved joint no longer will have a normal acting system because the destruction of the articular cartilages can no longer act as shock absorber. abnormal integrin expression alters cell/ECM signaling and modifies chondrocyte synthesis, with the following imbalance of destructive cytokines over regulatory factors. IL-1, TNF-alpha and other pro-catabolic cytokines activate the enzymatic degradation of cartilage matrix and are not counterbalanced by adequate synthesis of inhibitors. The main enzymes involved in ECM breakdown are metalloproteinases (MMPs), which are sequentially activated by an amplifying cascade. MMP activity is partially inhibited by the tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMPs), whose synthesis is low compared with MMP production in OA cartilage.\n\n【5】 # Causes\nOsteoarthritis (OA) is a result of a variety of disorders that lead to structural and functional failure in involved joints. Osteoarthritis, traditionally, has been considered as a disease specifically related to articular cartilage. Presently, it's been proven that OA influencing the whole joint system consisted of capsule, and synovium, subchondral bone, cartilage, menisci, ligaments, and periarticular muscle.\n\n【6】 # Differentiating Osteoarthritis overview from Other Diseases\nOA must be differentiated from other diseases that cause joint impairment and  other related signs and symptoms such as Rheumatoid arthritis, Gout, Joint tuberculosis.\n\n【7】 # Epidemiology and Demographics\nOA is one of the most frequent diagnoses and is the leading cause of disability among the adult population in the USA. According to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), more than 26 million people in the USA were diagnosed with different forms of OA. The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) reported that the 46.4 million Americans and 21.6% of Americans adults were diagnosed with arthritis. OA can involve any joint, but knees, hips, hands, are most common sites for this involvement.\n\n【8】 # Risk Factors\nOsteoarthritis is a multifactorial disease and the interactions between systemic and local factors play important role in development and prognosis of OA.\n\n【9】 # Screening\nRoutine screening for osteoarthritis is not indicated unless the patient is symptomatic.\n\n【10】 # Natural History, Complications, and Prognosis\n\n【11】 ## Natural History\nThe orthopedic surgeons are frequently asked by their patients regarding the final outcome and the prognosis of their diseased joint/joints caused by OA. Information about the natural history of OA is very important for upcoming determinations and planning for patients management. A small number of studies are available studied the role of the radiographic findings, joint congruence, or even the daily life activity on the OA progression.\n\n【12】 ## Complications\nOA is a leading cause of morbidity having significant effects on patients life and the health care system and even it could cause heavy economic burden. According to the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons report movement limitation are found in 80% of adults diagnosed with osteoarthritis. Meanwhile, 25% of these patients facing difficulties in their of daily living activities. 11% of them need personal care assistance and 14% required help with their routine needs.\n\n【13】 ## Prognosis\nMost osteoarthritis cases do stabilize. Some osteoarthritis cases progress. A small number of osteoarthritis patients improve spontaneously.\n\n【14】 # Diagnosis\n\n【15】 ## Diagnostic Criteria\nThere is no specific signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis (OA) diagnosis. Although, osteoarthritis may be diagnosed based on several elements such as patients age, past medical history, and available symptoms. Osteoarthritis of the major joints is diagnosed using a combination of patients past medical history, physical examination, and variety of lab tests including imaging studies such as X-ray.\n\n【16】 ## History and Symptoms\nPatients' past medical history is the most useful tool for the osteoarthritis diagnosis.\n\n【17】 ## Physical Examination\nA physical examination following the medical history is necessary for medical doctors to reach an exact diagnosis. In OA, loss or limited range of motion in specific joints, swelling, tenderness, and bony growths in the surrounding area are the most important keys in physical examination of OA cases.\n\n【18】 ## Laboratory Findings\nIf the OA diagnosis is in doubt, laboratory tests are used to help doctors get a confirmation regarding a suspected diagnosis of osteoarthritis.\n\n【19】 ## Imaging Findings\nX-Ray and CT-Scan are the most common tools used in this regard.\n\n【20】 ## Other Diagnostic Studies\n\n【21】 # Treatment\n\n【22】 ## Medical Therapy\nNonpharmacologic therapy is consisted of physical therapy and specific type of physical exercises, bracing and splinting. Physical therapy results in short-term pain reduction, and improvement in physical function in the diseased joint to preserve its the ability for daily tasks like walking, dressing, and even bathing. Having moderate activity strengthens the muscles around the diseased joint and this reduces stress and increases the stability of the joint system. On the other hand, resting is another important healing factor in OA. Bracing and splinting as other methods help to support painful or unsjoints. Using a cane can help decrease the weight pressure in diseased hip or knee, but it should be used on the contralateral side of the affected joint.\n\n【23】 ## Surgery\nSurgical interventions in OA cases should be considered when the symptoms have no response to the first line treatments because osteoarthritis symptoms can be successfully managed through non-surgical care. For some, however, if they are experiencing severe joint damage, extreme pain, or very restricted mobility, surgery may be a viable option in this regard. The main indication criteria for surgery in OA is pain and disabilities despite the medical treatments. The most common and effective surgical intervention are arthroscopic surgery, osteotomy, and arthroplasty (total joint replacement). Considering the potential benefits of surgery like pain relief, improved movement, increased patients status, and actual disease prognosis, it should be remembered that any surgical interventions have risks. Meanwhile, overweight patients or patients with co-morbidities have higher risk of operation. The current joint prostheses have an expected functional usage for almost 15 to 20 years.\n\n【24】 ## Prevention\nPrimary prevention for OA include :\n- Weight loss\n- Physical activity\n- Injury prevention\n- Control infectious disease\n- Avoidance of trauma on the joint\n- Omega-3 fatty acid", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Common adverse reactions include bradycardia, hypotension, urticaria, edema, anaphylactoid reactions,\nlightheadedness, nervousness, euphoria, confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, tinnitus.\n\n【3】 # Adult Indications and Dosage\n\n【4】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Adult)\n\n【5】 # Indications\n- 4% Citanest Plain Dental Injection is indicated for the production of local anesthesia in dentistry by nerve block or infiltration techniques.\n\n【6】 # Dosage\n- The dosage of 4% Citanest Plain Dental Injection varies and depends on the physical status of the patient, the area of the oral cavity to be anesthetized, the vascularity of the oral tissues, and the technique of anesthesia. The least volume of injection that results in effective local anesthesia should be administered. For specific techniques and procedures of local anesthesia in the oral cavity, refer to standard textbooks.\nInferior Alveolar Block\n- There are no practical clinical differences between prilocaine with and without epinephrine when used for inferior alveolar blocks.\nMaxillary Infiltration\n- 4% Citanest Plain Dental Injection is recommended for use in maxillary infiltration anesthesia for procedures in which the painful aspects can be completed within 15 minutes after the injection. 4% Citanest Plain Dental Injection is therefore especially suited to short procedures in the maxillary anterior teeth. For long procedures, or those involving maxillary posterior teeth where soft tissue numbness is not troublesome to the patient, Prilocaine HCl 4% with epinephrine 1:200,000 is recommended.\n- For most routine procedures, initial dosages of 1 to 2 mL of 4% Citanest Plain Dental Injection will usually provide adequate infiltration or major nerve block anesthesia.\n- The maximum recommended dose that should ever be administered within a two-hour period in normal healthy adults should be calculated based upon the patient's weight as follows:\nMaximum Recommended Dosages\n- In patients weighing <150 lbs (70 kg), no more than 4 mg/lb (8 mg/kg) should be administered. In patients weighing <150 lbs, no more than 600 mg (8 cartridges) of prilocaine HCl should be administered as a single injection.\n\n【7】 ## Off-Label Use and Dosage (Adult)\n\n【8】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Prilocaine hydrochloride in adult patients.\n\n【9】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n\n【10】 # Indications\n- Regional anesthesia\n\n【11】 # Pediatric Indications and Dosage\n\n【12】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Pediatric)\nThere is limited information regarding FDA-Labeled Use of Prilocaine hydrochloride in pediatric patients.\n\n【13】 ## Off-Label Use and Dosage (Pediatric)\n\n【14】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Prilocaine hydrochloride in pediatric patients.\n\n【15】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n\n【16】 # Indications\n- Regional anesthesia\n\n【17】 # Contraindications\n- Prilocaine is contraindicated in patients with a known history of hypersensitivity to local anesthetics of the amide type and in those rare patients with congenital or idiopathic methemoglobinemia.\n\n【18】 # Warnings\n- DENTAL PRACTITIONERS WHO EMPLOY LOCAL ANESTHETIC AGENTS SHOULD BE WELL VERSED IN DIAGNOSIS AND MANAGEMENT OF EMERGENCIES THAT MAY ARISE FROM THEIR USE. RESUSCITATIVE EQUIPMENT, OXYGEN AND OTHER RESUSCITATIVE DRUGS SHOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR IMMEDIATE USE.\n- To minimize the likelihood of intravascular injection, aspiration should be performed before the local anesthetic solution is injected. If blood is aspirated, the needle must be repositioned until no return of blood can be elicited by aspiration. Note, however, that the absence of blood in the syringe does not assure that intravascular injection will be avoided.\nMethemoglobinemia\n- Prilocaine has been associated with the development of methemoglobinemia. Very young patients, patients with congenital or idiopathic methemoglobinemia, or patients with glucose-6-phosphate deficiencies are more susceptible to methemoglobinemia.\n at greater risk for developing methemoglobinemia.\n\n【19】 ## PRECAUTIONS\nGeneral\n be used with caution in patients with severe shock or heart block.\n- Cardiovascular and respiratory (adequacy of ventilation) vital signs and the patient's state of consciousness should be monitored after each local anesthetic injection. Restlessness, anxiety, tinnitus, dizziness, blurred vision, tremors, depression or drowsiness should alert the practitioner to the possibility of central nervous system toxicity. Signs and symptoms of depressed cardiovascular function may commonly result from a vasovagal reaction, particularly if the patient is in an upright position.\n- Since amide-type local anesthetics are metabolized by the liver, prilocaine should be used with caution in patients with hepatic disease.\n be used with caution in patients with impaired cardiovascular function since they may be less able to compensate for functional changes associated with the prolongation of A-V conduction produced by these drugs.\n- Many drugs used during the conduct of anesthesia are considered potential triggering agents for familial malignant hyperthermia. Since it is not known whether amide-type local anesthetics may trigger this reaction and since the need for supplemental general anesthesia cannot be predicted in advance, it is suggested that a standard protocol for the management of malignant hyperthermia should be available. Early unexplained signs of tachycardia, tachypnea, labile blood pressure, and metabolic acidosis may precede temperature elevation. Successful outcome is dependent on early diagnosis, prompt discontinuance of the suspect triggering agent(s) and institution of treatment, including oxygen therapy, indicated supportive measures and dantrolene (consult dantrolene sodium intravenous package insert before using).\n- Prilocaine should be used with caution in persons with known drug sensitivities. Patients allergic to para-aminobenzoic acid derivatives (procaine, tetracaine, benzocaine, etc.) have not shown cross sensitivity to prilocaine.\nUse in the Head and Neck Area\n- Small doses of local anesthetics injected into the head and neck area, including retrobulbar, dental and stellate ganglion blocks, may produce adverse reactions similar to systemic toxicity seen with unintentional intravascular injections of larger doses. Confusion, convulsions, respiratory depression and/or respiratory arrest, and cardiovascular stimulation or depression have been reported. These reactions may be due to intra-arterial injection of the local anesthetic with retrograde flow to the cerebral circulation. Patients receiving these blocks should have their circulation and respiration monitored and be constantly observed. Resuscitative equipment and personnel for treating adverse reactions should be immediately available. Dosage recommendations should not be exceeded.\n\n【20】 # Adverse Reactions\n\n【21】 ## Clinical Trials Experience\n- Swelling and persistent paresthesia of the lips and oral tissues may occur. Persistent paresthesias lasting weeks to months, and in rare instances paresthesia lasting greater than one year, have been reported.\n- Adverse experiences following the administration of prilocaine are similar in nature to those observed with other amide local anesthetic agents. These adverse experiences are, in general, dose-related and may result from high plasma levels caused by excessive dosage, rapid absorption or unintentional intravascular injection, or may result from a hypersensitivity, idiosyncrasy or diminished tolerance on the part of the patient. Serious adverse experiences are generally systemic in nature. The following types are those most commonly reported:\nCentral Nervous System\n- CNS manifestations are excitatory and/or depressant and may be characterized by lightheadedness, nervousness, apprehension, euphoria, confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, tinnitus, blurred or double vision, vomiting, sensations of heat, cold or numbness, twitching, tremors, convulsions, unconsciousness, respiratory depression, and arrest. The excitatory manifestations may be very brief or may not occur at all, in which case the first manifestation of toxicity may be drowsiness merging into unconsciousness and respiratory arrest.\n- Drowsiness following the administration of prilocaine is usually an early sign of a high blood level of the drug and may occur as a consequence of rapid absorption.\nCardiovascular System\n- Cardiovascular manifestations are usually depressant and are characterized by bradycardia, hypotension, and cardiovascular collapse, which may lead to cardiac arrest.\n- Signs and symptoms of depressed cardiovascular function may commonly result from a vasovagal reaction, particularly if the patient is in an upright position. Less commonly, they may result from a direct effect of the drug. Failure to recognize the premonitory signs such as sweating, a feeling of faintness, changes in pulse or sensorium may result in progressive cerebral hypoxia and seizure or serious cardiovascular catastrophe. Management consists of placing the patient in the recumbent position and ventilation with oxygen. Supportive treatment of circulatory depression may require the administration of intravenous fluids, and, when appropriate, a vasopressor (e.g., ephedrine) as directed by the clinical situation.\nAllergic\nAllergic reactions are characterized by cutaneous lesions, urticaria, edema, or anaphylactoid reactions. Allergic reactions as a result of sensitivity to prilocaine are extremely rare and, if they occur, should be managed by conventional means. The detection of sensitivity by skin testing is of doubtful value.\nNeurologic\n- The incidences of adverse reactions (e.g., persistent neurologic deficit) associated with the use of local anesthetics may be related to the technique employed, the total dose of local anesthetic administered, the particular drug used, the route of administration, and the physical condition of the patient.\n\n【22】 ## Postmarketing Experience\nThere is limited information regarding Postmarketing Experience of Prilocaine hydrochloride in the drug label.\n\n【23】 # Drug Interactions\n- Concurrent administration of vasopressor drugs and ergot-type oxytocic drugs may cause severe, persistent hypertension or cerebrovascular accidents.\n- Prilocaine may contribute to the formation of methemoglobinemia in patients treated with other drugs known to cause this condition\n\n【24】 # Use in Specific Populations\n\n【25】 ### Pregnancy\nPregnancy Category (FDA): \nPregnancy Category B\n- Reproduction studies have been performed in rats at doses up to 30 times the human dose and revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to prilocaine. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response. General consideration should be given to this fact before administering prilocaine to women of childbearing potential, especially during early pregnancy when maximum organogenesis takes place.\nPregnancy Category (AUS):\n- Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) Pregnancy Category\nThere is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Prilocaine hydrochloride in women who are pregnant.\n\n【26】 ### Labor and Delivery\nThere is no FDA guidance on use of Prilocaine hydrochloride during labor and delivery.\n\n【27】 ### Nursing Mothers\n- It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when prilocaine is administered to a nursing woman.\n\n【28】 ### Pediatric Use\n- Dosages in children should be reduced, commensurate with age, body weight, and physical condition.\n\n【29】 ### Geriatic Use\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Prilocaine hydrochloride with respect to geriatric patients.\n\n【30】 ### Gender\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Prilocaine hydrochloride with respect to specific gender populations.\n\n【31】 ### Race\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Prilocaine hydrochloride with respect to specific racial populations.\n\n【32】 ### Renal Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Prilocaine hydrochloride in patients with renal impairment.\n\n【33】 ### Hepatic Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Prilocaine hydrochloride in patients with hepatic impairment.\n\n【34】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Prilocaine hydrochloride in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n\n【35】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\nThere is no FDA guidance one the use of Prilocaine hydrochloride in patients who are immunocompromised.\n\n【36】 # Administration and Monitoring\n\n【37】 ### Administration\n- Intravenous\n\n【38】 ### Monitoring\nThere is limited information regarding Monitoring of Prilocaine hydrochloride in the drug label.\n\n【39】 # IV Compatibility\nThere is limited information regarding IV Compatibility of Prilocaine hydrochloride in the drug label.\n\n【40】 # Overdosage\n- Acute emergencies from local anesthetics are generally related to high plasma levels encountered during therapeutic use of local anesthetics.\nManagement of Local Anesthetic Emergencies\n- The first consideration is prevention, best accomplished by careful and constant monitoring of cardiovascular and respiratory vital signs and the patient's state of consciousness after each local anesthetic injection. At the first sign of change, oxygen should be administered.\n- The first step in the management of convulsions consists of immediate attention to the maintenance of a patent airway and assisted or controlled ventilation with oxygen and a delivery system capable of permitting immediate positive airway pressure by mask. Immediately after the institution of these ventilatory measures, the adequacy of the circulation should be evaluated, keeping in mind that drugs used to treat convulsions sometimes depress the circulation when administered intravenously. Should convulsions persist despite adequate respiratory support, and if the status of the circulation permits, small increments of an ultra-short acting barbiturate (such as thiopental or thiamylal) or a benzodiazepine (such as diazepam) may be administered intravenously. The clinician should be familiar, prior to use of local anesthetics, with these anticonvulsant drugs. Supportive treatment of circulatory depression may require administration of intravenous fluids and, when appropriate, a vasopressor as directed by the clinical situation (eg, ephedrine).\n- If not treated immediately, both convulsions and cardiovascular depression can result in hypoxia, acidosis, bradycardia, arrhythmias and cardiac arrest. If cardiac arrest should occur, standard cardiopulmonary resuscitative measures should be instituted.\n- Endotracheal intubation, employing drugs and techniques familiar to the clinician, may be indicated, after initial administration of oxygen by mask, if difficulty is encountered in the maintenance of a patent airway or if prolonged ventilatory support (assisted or controlled) is indicated.\n- Dialysis is of negligible value in the treatment of acute overdosage with prilocaine.\n- The development of methemoglobinemia is generally dose related but may occur at any dose in susceptible individuals. While methemoglobin values of less than 20% do not generally produce any clinical symptoms, the appearance of cyanosis at 2 to 4 hours following administration should be evaluated in terms of the general health status of the patient.\n- Methemoglobinemia can be reversed when indicated by intravenous administration of methylene blue at a dosage of 1 to 2 mg/kg given over a five minute period.\n- The subcutaneous LD50 of prilocaine HCl in female mice is 550 (359 to  mg/kg.\n\n【41】 # Pharmacology\nThere is limited information regarding Prilocaine hydrochloride Pharmacology in the drug label.\n\n【42】 ## Mechanism of Action\n- Prilocaine stabilizes the neuronal membrane by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses, thereby effecting local anesthetic action.\nOnset and Duration of Action\n- When used for infiltration injection in dental patients, the time of onset of anesthesia averages less than 2 minutes with an average duration of soft tissue anesthesia of approximately 2 hours.\n- Based on electrical stimulation studies, 4% Citanest Plain Dental Injection provides a duration of pulpal anesthesia of approximately 10 minutes in maxillary infiltration injections. In clinical studies, this has been found to provide complete anesthesia for procedures lasting an average of 20 minutes.\n- When used for inferior alveolar nerve block, the time of onset of 4% Citanest Plain Dental Injection averages less than three minutes with an average duration of soft tissue anesthesia of approximately 2½ hours.\n\n【43】 ## Structure\n INDICATIONS AND USAGE for specific uses. The quantitative composition is shown in \n4% Citanest Plain Dental contains prilocaine HCl, which is chemically designated as propanamide, N-(2-methyl-phenyl) -2- (propylamino)-, monohydrochloride and has the following structural formula:\n- Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration.\n- The specific quantitative composition is shown in \nNote: Sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid may be used to adjust the pH of 4% Citanest Plain Dental Injection.\n\n【44】 ## Pharmacodynamics\nThere is limited information regarding Pharmacodynamics of Prilocaine hydrochloride in the drug label.\n\n【45】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n- Information derived from diverse formulations, concentrations and usages reveals that prilocaine is completely absorbed following parenteral administration, its rate of absorption depending, for example, upon such factors as the site of administration and the presence or absence of a vasoconstrictor agent. Prilocaine is metabolized in both the liver and the kidney and excreted via the kidney. It is not metabolized by plasma esterases. Hydrolysis of prilocaine by amidases yields ortho-toluidine and N-proylalanine. Both of these compounds may undergo ring hydroxylation.\n- O-toluidine has been found to produce methemoglobin, both in vitro and in vivo.\n- Because prilocaine is metabolized in both the liver and kidneys, hepatic and renal dysfunction may alter prilocaine kinetics.\n- As with other local anesthetic agents, the plasma binding of prilocaine may be dependent on drug concentration. At 0.5 to 1.0 mg/mL it is 55% protein bound.\n- Prilocaine crosses the blood-brain and placental barriers, presumably by passive diffusion.\n- Factors such as acidosis and the use of CNS stimulants and depressants affect the CNS levels of prilocaine required to produce overt systemic effects. In the rhesus monkey, arterial blood levels of 20 mg/mL have been shown to be the threshold for convulsive activity.\n\n【46】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\nCarcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\n- Studies of prilocaine in animals to evaluate the carcinogenic and mutagenic potential or the effect on fertility have not been conducted.\n- Chronic oral toxicity studies of ortho-toluidine, a metabolite of prilocaine, in mice (150 to 4800 mg/kg) and rats (150 to 800 mg/kg) have shown that ortho-toluidine is a carcinogen in both species.

A parent isotope is one that undergoes decay to form a daughter isotope. The daughter isotope may be sor it may decay to form a daughter isotope of its own. The daughter of a daughter isotope is sometimes called a granddaughter isotope.\n for identical pairings of parent and daughter isotopes. While the decay of a single atom occurs spontaneously, the decay of an initial population of identical atoms over time, t, follows a decaying exponential distribution, e-λt, where λ is called a decay constant. Because of this exponential nature, one of the properties of an isotope is its half-life, the time by which half of an initial number of identical parent radioisotopes have decayed to their daughters.  Half-lives have been determined in laboratories for thousands of radioisotopes (or, radionuclides).  These can range from nearly instantaneous to as much as 1019 years or more.\n generate gaseous radon as the next stage in the decay chain. Thus, radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas, which is the leading cause of lung cancer in non-smokers.\n\n【1】 # Types\nThe four most common modes of radioactive decay are: alpha decay, beta minus decay, beta plus decay (considered as both positron emission and electron capture) and isomeric transition. Of these decay processes, alpha decay changes the atomic mass number of the nucleus, and always decreases it by four. Because of this, almost any decay will result in a nucleus whose atomic mass number has the same residue mod 4, dividing all nuclides into four classes. The members of any possible decay chain must be drawn entirely from one of these classes.\n been found in minute amounts on earth. The fourth chain, the neptunium series with A=4n+1, due to quite short half life time of its starting isotope 237Np, is already extinct, except for the final rate-limiting step. The ending isotope of this chain is 205Tl. Some older sources give the final isotope as 209Bi, but it was recently discovered that 209Bi is radioactive with half-life of 1.9×1019 years.\n many shorter chains, for example carbon-14.  On the earth, most of the starting isotopes of these chains are generated by cosmic radiation.\n\n【2】 # Actinide alpha decay chains\nIn the s below, the minor branches of decay (with the branching ratio of less than 0.0001%) are omitted. The energy release includes the total kinetic energy of all the emitted particles (electrons, alpha particles, gamma quanta, neutrinos, Auger electrons and X-rays) and the recoil nucleus, assuming that the original nucleus was at rest.\n given. These names were used at the time when the decay chains were first discovered and investigated. From these names one can infer the particular chain to which the nuclide belongs. Also, the names indicate similarities: for example, Tn, Rn and An are all inert gases.\n\n【3】 # Beta decay chains\nSince heavy nuclei have a greater proportion of neutrons, fission product nuclei almost always start out with a neutron/proton ratio greater than what is sfor their mass range; therefore they undergo multiple beta decays in succession, each converting a neutron to a proton. The first decays tend to have higher decay energy and shorter half-life; the last decays may have low decay energy and/or long half-life.\nFor example, uranium-235 has 92 protons and 143 neutrons. Fission takes one more neutron, then produces two or three more neutrons; assume that 92 protons and 142 neutrons are available for the two fission product nuclei. Suppose they have mass 99 with 39 protons and 60 neutrons (yttrium-, and mass 135 with 53 protons and 82 neutrons (iodine-; then the decay chains are:\n\n【4】 # Literature\nC.M. Lederer, J.M.

The allergy is not actually an allergy to food but a syndrome that develops in hay fever sufferers.  The immune system mistakes the food proteins for the pollen proteins and causes an allergic reaction.\n\n【2】 # Symptoms\nOAS sufferers may have a number of reactions that usually occur very rapidly, within minutes of eating a trigger food.  The most common reaction is an itching or burning sensation in the lips, mouth, and/or pharynx.  Sometimes other reactions can be triggered in the eyes, nose, and skin.  The most severe reactions can result in asthma problems or anaphylaxis. If a sufferer is able to swallow the food, there is a good chance that there will be a reaction later in the gastrointestinal tract. Vomiting, diarrhea, severe indigestion, or cramps may occur.\n\n【3】 # Cross reactions\nAllergies to a certain pollen are associated with OAS reactions to certain foods.  For instance, an allergy to ragweed is associated with OAS reactions to banana, watermelon, cantaloupe, honeydew, zucchini, and cucumber. This does not mean that all sufferers of an allergy to ragweed will experience adverse effects from all or even any of these foods. Reactions may begin with one type of food and with reactions to others developing later. However, it should be noted that reaction to one or more foods in any given category does not necessarily mean a person is allergic to all foods in that group. Often well-cooked, canned, or frozen food offenders cause no reaction due to denaturation of the cross-reacting proteins.\n\n【4】 # Treatment\n relieve the symptoms of the allergy.

{"seq_id": "191c8f93-c42a-4cb5-b5e2-c2f89b19d3f6", "title": null, "text": "【0】 Nursing shortage\nNursing shortage refers to a situation where the demand for nurses is greater than the supply.\nThe total number of nurses working in the healthcare field in the United States has decreased from 2,669,603 in the year 2000 to 2,262,020 in year 2001. The amount of nursing responsibilities has increased and the patients are more ill than before. In addition, the average age of nurses increases while the number of applications to baccalaureate programs has decreased. Furthermore, new opportunities became available for the nursing practice, which further drains the number of nurses available for the acute care settings. Other factors that affect the nursing shortage are aging workforce, problems with retention, and difficulty recruiting young people into the field. \n\n【1】 # Job satisfaction\nStudies have shown that the nursing shortage is an issue in developed countries today.   students need now apply to schools to become nurses because admission rates have increased.   Several studies have been done to understand how nurses feel about their career.  About 20 years ago, sociologist Bryan Turner initially identified nurses’ most important complaints as subordination to the medical profession as well as over regulation, and difficult working conditions. Also, a report from the Commonwealth of Australia identified some of the dissatisfaction as stemming from frequent schedule changes, overloads, shift work, lack of appreciation by superiors and colleagues, as well as lack of childcare. Inadequate pay was identified as a lesser problem based on the report. Later, a study revealed that the dissatisfaction among nurses focused on conflicting expectations from nurses and managers due to regulation of cost, lack of opportunity to provide comprehensive nursing care, and disillusioned workforce or “loss of confidence in, and frustration with, the healthcare system.” Limitations to comprehensive care were identified because nurses are overloaded with the number of assigned patients, massive paperwork for billing purposes, and short staffing to cut cost. \nIn the past 20 years administrative/government policies and practice has changed very little, cost-cutting is still the priority, patient loads uncontrolled, and nurses are rarely consulted when recommending changes.  The major reason why nurses plan to leave the field, as stated by the First Consulting Group, is because of the working conditions.  With the high turnover rate, the nursing field does not have a chance to build up the already frustrated staff.  Aside from the deteriorating working conditions, the real problem is “nursing’s failure to be attractive to the younger generation.” There’s a decline in interest among college students to consider nursing as a probable career. More than half of currently working nurses “would not recommend nursing to their own children” and a little less than a quarter would advise others to avoid this as a profession all together. \n\n【2】 # Nursing shortage impact\nNursing shortage has the following effects: \n- Increase nurses’ patient’s loads\n- Increases the risk for error\n- Increase risk of spreading infection to patients and staffs\n- Increase risk for occupational injury\n- Increased deaths\n- Increase in nursing turnover\n- Increase perception of unsafe working conditions, contributing to increase shortage, and hindering local or national recruitment efforts\n- Increase the nurses chance of getting psychiatric help because of massive amounts of stress\nThe negative impact mentioned above intensifies with the nursing shortage in developing countries due to recruitment to work abroad to wealthier countries.  For example, nurses from the Philippines and Africa are recruited to work for the United States and Europe.\n\n【3】 # Patching up the shortage\nNursing shortages can be consistent or intermittent depending on the current number of patient needing medical attention. In order to respond to this fluctuating  census, health care industries have utilized float pool nurses and agency nurses. Float pool nurses are nursing staffs employed by the hospital to work in any unit within the organization. Agency nurses are employed by an independent staffing organization and have the opportunity to work in any hospitals on a daily, weekly or contractual basis. Similar to other professionals, both types of nurses can only work within their licensed scope of practice, training, and certification.\nFloat pool nurses and agency nurses, as mentioned by First Consulting group, are currently used in response to the current shortage. Use of the said services increases the cost of healthcare, decreases specialty, and decreases the interest in long-term solutions to the shortage. On the other hand, international recruitment gives rise to concerns on clinical competencies, cultural sensitivity, and ethics in global recruitment. \nA growing response to the nursing shortage is the advent of travel nursing a specialized sub-set of the staffing agency industry that has evolved to serve the needs of hospitals effected by the increasing nursing shortage. There are an estimated 25,500 Registered Nurse Travelers working in the U.S. The number of LVN/LPN Nurse Travelers is not known.\n\n【4】 # Retention and recruitment\nRetention and recruitment are important responses to a long-term solution to the nursing shortage. Some of the reasons that contribute to retention of nursing in the healthcare field are addressed in different levels and are as follows. In spite of the discontent, nurses continue to practice. Also, there is a co-relation of high job satisfaction and significant education activities among nurses. Other possible solutions is through incentives and funding coupled with employer and hospital regulatory approach to retain the current number of staff and could help avoid aggravating turnover.  \nTo assist the healthcare field, congress annually approves a budget for the year through the Nurse Reinvestment Act passed in 2002. Previously in 2004 and 2005, 141.9 million and 205 million were approved in each fiscal year, respectively. The funding is distributed to advance nursing education, scholarships, grants, diversity programs, loan repayment programs, nursing faculty programs, and comprehensive geriatric education. \nEfforts of some states to address the nursing shortage in United States focused on the nursing working conditions. Currently, mandatory overtime for nurses is prohibited in nine states, hospital accountability to implement valid staffing plans in seven states, and only one state implement the minimum staffing ratio. \nIn terms of recruitment, suggestions were made in order make nursing attractive as a profession. One of these suggestions was presenting Nursing as a unique discipline, making it an attractive field for the young people.  As mentioned in retention, incentives and funding to recruitment effort can contribute to the solution. \nMany hospitals believe retention is more important than recruitment. They feel that if you treat an employee well, they will be your best recruiters. Word of mouth goes far.\n\n【5】 # Market philosophy and Impacts on healthcare\n viewed as consumers.  Therefore, only clinical responsibilities, such as medication administration, dressing changes, foley catheter insertions, and anything that involves tangible supplies, are quantified and incorporated into the organizational budget and plan of care for the consumers.\n\n【6】 # US nursing shortage\nThe US population is projected to grow at least 18% over two decades in the 21st century, while the population of those sixty-five and older is expected to increase three times that rate.  The current shortfall of nurses is projected at over 1 million by the year 2020. \nProfessional and related occupations are expected to rapidly increase between years 2000 – 2012. The demand for healthcare practitioners and technical occupations will increase and projected to have 1.7 million job openings with in this time period. In this group, the demand for registered nurses is the highest. Registered nurses are predicted to have a total of 1,101 openings due to growth during this 10 year period.  In a 2001 American Hospital Association survey, 715 hospitals reported that 126,000 nursing positions were unfilled.  \n decreased. Wage among nurses leveled as it relates to inflation between 1990 and 1994.  \nComparing the data released by the Bureau of Health Professions, the projections of shortage in within two years have increased.\nSource: Data from the Bureau of Health Professions \nSource: Data from the Bureau of Health Professions. .\n\n【7】 # Global shortage and recruitment\nThe nursing shortage is in global scale according to the International Council of Nurses: Netherlands needed to fill 7000 nursing positions in year 2002, England needs to fill 22,000 positions in year 2000, and Canada will need about 10,000 nursing graduates by year 2011. \nIn the United States, recruiting foreign nurses has been practiced for 50 years. Philippines supplied most of its nurses to the United States and other countries. Overall, the total number of foreign graduate nurses continues to increase to 14% between 1998 and 2003. \nU.S. healthcare facilities pushes to “ease restrictions” on the immigration law to increase the number of recruited foreign nurses. On the other hand, this recruitment practice is only a temporary solution and does not fully address the nursing shortage as mentioned by American Nursing Association (ANA). \n\n【8】 # Impact of global recruitment\nCountries that send their nurses abroad experience a shortage and strain their own healthcare system. In South Africa, accelerated recruitment by developed countries such as United States, United Kingdom and Australia is putting more strain in the healthcare system due to prevalence of diseases, such as AIDS, and limited resources.  Similar to the U.S., nurses who leave the organization are a financial disadvantage due to the need to fund recruiting and retraining of new nurses into the system. Also, every nurse that leaves the country in South Africa is an annual loss of $184,000, related to the financial and economical impact of the nursing shortage. The following represents the number of nurses per 100,000-population in South African Countries. \nIn addition, physicians in the Philippines have shifted to the nursing field for export opportunities. \nIn an American Hospital Association study, the cost to replace one nurse in the U. S. was estimated at around $30,000 - $64,000.  This amount is likely related to the cost of recruiting and training nurses into the organization. Hiring foreign nurses is more financially taxing compared to hiring domestic-graduate nurses; however, facilities save money in a long run because foreign nurses have a contractual obligation to complete their term.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

There are at least two closed conformations; in one, the channel can open if the membrane potential becomes positive inside. Voltage-gated K+ channels inactivate after opening, entering a distinctive, second closed conformation. In the inactivated conformation, the channel cannot open, even if the transmembrane voltage is favorable. A domain at one end of the K+ channel protein mediates inactivation. This end of the protein can transiently plug the inner opening of the pore, preventing ion movement through the channel.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Common adverse reactions include Injection site pain, Pruritus, Rash, Increased liver enzymes, Fever.\n\n【3】 # Adult Indications and Dosage\n\n【4】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Adult)\n\n【5】 ### Indications\n- Cefizox (ceftizoxime for injection, USP) is indicated in the treatment of infections due to susceptible strains of the microorganisms listed below.\n- Lower Respiratory Tract Infections caused by Klebsiella spp.; Proteus mirabilis; Escherichia coli; Haemophilus influenzae including ampicillin­resistant strains; Staphylococcus aureus (penicillinase­ and nonpenicillinase­producing); Serratia spp.; Enterobacter spp.; Bacteroides spp.; and Streptococcus spp. including S. pneumoniae, but excluding enterococci.\n- Urinary Tract Infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus (penicillinase­ and nonpenicillinase­producing); Escherichia coli; Pseudomonas spp. including P.aeruginosa; Proteus mirabilis; P. vulgaris; Providencia rettgeri (formerly Proteus rettgeri) and Morganella morganii (formerly Proteus morganii); Klebsiella spp.; Serratia spp. including S. marcescens; and Enterobacter spp.\n- Gonorrhea including uncomplicated cervical and urethral gonorrhea caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae.\n- Pelvic Inflammatory Disease caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli or Streptococcus agalactiae. NOTE: Ceftizoxime, like other cephalosporins, has no activity against Chlamydia trachomatis. Therefore, when cephalosporins are used in the treatment of patients with pelvic inflammatory disease and C. trachomatis is one of the suspected pathogens, appropriate anti­chlamydial coverage should be added.\n- Intra­Abdominal Infections caused by Escherichia coli; Staphylococcusepidermidis; Streptococcus spp. (excluding enterococci); Enterobacter spp.; Klebsiella spp.; Bacteroides spp. including B. fragilis; and anaerobic cocci, including Peptococcus spp. and Peptostreptococcus spp.\n- Septicemia caused by Streptococcus spp. including S. pneumoniae (but excluding enterococci); Staphylococcus aureus (penicillinase­ and nonpenicillinase­producing); Escherichia coli; Bacteroides spp. including B. fragilis; Klebsiella spp.; and Serratia spp.\n- Skin and Skin Structure Infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus (penicillinase­ and nonpenicillinase­producing); Staphylococcus epidermidis; Escherichia coli; Klebsiella spp.; Streptococcus spp. including Streptococcus pyogenes (but excluding enterococci); Proteus mirabilis; Serratia spp.; Enterobacter spp.; Bacteroides spp. including B. fragilis; and anaerobic cocci, including Peptococcus spp. and Peptostreptococcus spp.\n- Bone and Joint Infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus (penicillinase­ and nonpenicillinase­producing); Streptococcus spp. (excluding enterococci); Proteusmirabilis; Bacteroides spp.; and anaerobic cocci, including Peptococcus spp. and Peptostreptococcus spp.\n been used successfully in the treatment of a limited number of pediatric and adult cases of meningitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae.\n- Cefizox has been effective in the treatment of seriously ill, compromised patients, including those who were debilitated, immunosuppressed, or neutropenic.\n- Infections caused by aerobic gram­negative and by mixtures of organisms resistant to other cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, or penicillins have responded to treatment with Cefizox.\n- Because of the serious nature of some urinary tract infections due to P. aeruginosa and because many strains of Pseudomonas species are only moderately susceptible to Cefizox, higher dosage is recommended. Other therapy should be instituted if the response is not prompt.\n- Susceptibility studies on specimens obtained prior to therapy should be used to determine the response of causative organisms to Cefizox. Therapy with Cefizox may be initiated pending results of the studies; however, treatment should be adjusted according to study findings. In serious infections, Cefizox has been used\n- concomitantly with aminoglycosides. Before using Cefizox\n- concomitantly with other antibiotics, the prescribing information for those agents\n- should be reviewed for contraindications, warnings, precautions, and adverse reactions. Renal function should be carefully monitored.\n- To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Cefizox and other antibacterial drugs, Cefizox should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.\n\n【6】 ### Dosage\n- The usual adult dosage is 1 or 2 grams of Cefizox (ceftizoxime for injection, USP) every 8 to 12 hours. Proper dosage and route of administration should be determined by the condition of the patient, severity of the infection, and susceptibility of the causative organisms.\n- Because of the serious nature of urinary tract infections due to P. aeruginosa and because many strains of Pseudomonas species are only moderately susceptible to Cefizox, higher dosage is recommended. Other therapy should be instituted if the response is not prompt.\n- A single, 1 gram IM dose is the usual dose for treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhea.\n- The IV route may be preferable for patients with bacterial septicemia, localized parenchymal abscesses (such as intra­abdominal abscess), peritonitis, or other severe or life­threatening infections.\n- In those with normal renal function, the IV dosage for such infections is 2 to 12 grams of Cefizox (ceftizoxime for injection, USP) daily. In conditions such as bacterial septicemia, 6 to 12 grams/day may be given initially by the IV route for several days, and the dosage may then be gradually reduced according to clinical response and laboratory findings.\n- Dosage may be increased to a total daily dose of 200 mg/kg (not to exceed the maximum adult dose for serious infection).\n- Modification of Cefizox dosage is necessary in patients with impaired renal function. Following an initial loading dose of 500 mg-1 gram IM or IV, the maintenance dosing schedule shown below should be followed. Further dosing should be determined by therapeutic monitoring, severity of the infection, and susceptibility of the causative organisms.\n- When only the serum creatinine level is available, creatinine clearance may be calculated from the following formula. The serum creatinine level should represent current renal function at the steady state.\n- Females are 0.85 of the calculated clearance values for males.\n- In patients undergoing hemodialysis, no additional supplemental dosing is required following hemodialysis; however, dosing should be timed so that the patient receives the dose (according to the below) at the end of the dialysis.\n- RECONSTITUTION\n- IM Administration: Reconstitute with Sterile Water for Injection.

IF THIS PRODUCT IS TO BE GIVEN TO PENICILLIN­SENSITIVE PATIENTS, CAUTION SHOULD BE EXERCISED BECAUSE CROSS HYPERSENSITIVITY AMONG BETA­LACTAM ANTIBIOTICS HAS BEEN CLEARLY DOCUMENTED AND MAY OCCUR IN UP TO 10% OF PATIENTS WITH A HISTORY OF PENICILLIN ALLERGY. IF AN ALLERGIC REACTION TO CEFIZOX OCCURS, DISCONTINUE THE DRUG. SERIOUS ACUTE HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS MAY REQUIRE TREATMENT WITH EPINEPHRINE AND OTHER EMERGENCY MEASURES, INCLUDING OXYGEN, IV FLUIDS, IV ANTIHISTAMINES, CORTICOSTEROIDS, PRESSOR AMINES, AND AIRWAY MANAGEMENT, AS CLINICALLY INDICATED.\n- Pseudomembranous colitis has been reported with nearly all antibacterial agents, including ceftizoxime, and may range in severity from mild to life threatening. Therefore, it is important to consider this diagnosis in patients who present with diarrhea subsequent to the administration of antibacterial agents.\n- Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon and may permit overgrowth of clostridia. Studies indicate that a toxin produced by Clostridium difficile is a primary cause of “antibiotic­associated” colitis.\n- After the diagnosis of pseudomembranous colitis has been established, appropriate therapeutic measures should be initiated. Mild cases of pseudomembranous colitis usually respond to drug discontinuation alone. In moderate to severe cases, consideration should be given to management with fluids and electrolytes, protein supplementation, and treatment with an antibacterial drug clinically effective against Clostridium difficile colitis.\n\n【18】 ### Precautions\n- As with all broad­spectrum antibiotics, Cefizox (ceftizoxime for injection, USP) should be prescribed with caution in individuals with a history of gastrointestinal disease, particularly colitis.\n- Although Cefizox has not been shown to produce an alteration in renal function, renal status should be evaluated, especially in seriously ill patients receiving maximum dose therapy. As with any antibiotic, prolonged use may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. Careful observation is essential; appropriate measures should be taken if superinfection occurs.\n- Cephalosporins may be associated with a fall in prothrombin activity. Those at risk include patients with renal or hepatic impairment, or poor nutritional state, as well as patients receiving a protracted course of antimicrobial therapy, and patients previously stabilized on anticoagulant therapy. Prothrombin time should be monitored in patients at risk and exogenous vitamin K administered as indicated.\n- Prescribing Cefizox in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.\n\n【19】 # Adverse Reactions\n\n【20】 ## Clinical Trials Experience\n- Cefizox (ceftizoxime for injection, USP) is generally well tolerated. The most frequent adverse reactions (greater than 1% but less than 5%) are:\n- Rash, pruritus, fever\n- Transient elevation in AST (SGOT), ALT (SGPT), and alkaline phosphatase.\n- Transient eosinophilia, thrombocytosis. Some individuals have developed a positive Coombs test.\n- Injection site--Burning, cellulitis, phlebitis with IV administration, pain, induration, tenderness, paresthesia.\n- The less frequent adverse reactions (less than 1%) are:\n- Numbness and anaphylaxis have been reported rarely.\n- Elevation of bilirubin has been reported rarely.\n- Transient elevations of BUN and creatinine have been occasionally observed with Cefizox.\n- Anemia, including hemolytic anemia with occasional fatal outcome, leukopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia have been reported rarely.\n- Vaginitis has occurred rarely.\n- Diarrhea; nausea and vomiting have been reported occasionally.\n- Symptoms of pseudomembranous colitis can appear during or after antibiotic treatment.\n- In addition to the adverse reactions listed above which have been observed in patients treated with ceftizoxime, the following adverse reactions and altered laboratory tests have been reported for cephalosporin­class antibioti\n- Stevens­Johnson syndrome, erythema multiforme, toxic epidermal necrolysis, serum­sickness like reaction, toxic nephropathy, aplastic anemia, hemorrhage, prolonged prothrombin time, elevated LDH, pancytopenia, and agranulocytosis.\n- Several cephalosporins have been implicated in triggering seizures, particularly in patients with renal impairment, when the dosage was not reduced. If seizures associated with drug therapy occur, the drug should be discontinued. Anticonvulsant therapy can be given if clinically indicated.\n\n【21】 ## Postmarketing Experience\nThere is limited information regarding Postmarketing Experience of Ceftizoxime in the drug label.\n\n【22】 # Drug Interactions\n- Although the occurrence has not been reported with Cefizox, nephrotoxicity has been reported following concomitant administration of other cephalosporins and aminoglycosides.\n\n【23】 # Use in Specific Populations\n\n【24】 ### Pregnancy\nPregnancy Category (FDA): B\n- Reproduction studies performed in rats and rabbits have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to Cefizox. There are, however, no adequate and well­controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human effects, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.\nPregnancy Category (AUS):\n- Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) Pregnancy Category\nThere is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Ceftizoxime in women who are pregnant.\n\n【25】 ### Labor and Delivery\n- Safety of Cefizox use during labor and delivery has not been established.\n\n【26】 ### Nursing Mothers\n- Cefizox is excreted in human milk in low concentrations. Caution should be exercised when Cefizox is administered to a nursing woman.\n\n【27】 ### Pediatric Use\n- Safety and efficacy in pediatric patients from birth to six months of age have not been established. In pediatric patients six months of age and older, treatment with Cefizox has been associated with transient elevated levels of eosinophils, AST (SGOT), ALT (SGPT), and CPK (creatine phosphokinase). The CPK elevation may be related to IM administration.\nThe potential for the toxic effect in pediatric patients from chemicals that may leach from the single­dose IV preparation in plastic has not been determined.\n\n【28】 ### Geriatic Use\n- Clinical studies of ceftizoxime did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.\n\n【29】 ### Gender\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Ceftizoxime with respect to specific gender populations.\n\n【30】 ### Race\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Ceftizoxime with respect to specific racial populations.\n\n【31】 ### Renal Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Ceftizoxime in patients with renal impairment.\n\n【32】 ### Hepatic Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Ceftizoxime in patients with hepatic impairment.\n\n【33】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Ceftizoxime in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n\n【34】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\nThere is no FDA guidance one the use of Ceftizoxime in patients who are immunocompromised.\n\n【35】 # Administration and Monitoring\n\n【36】 ### Administration\n- Intravenous\n\n【37】 ### Monitoring\n- Prothrombin time should be monitored in patients at risk and exogenous vitamin K administered as indicated.\n\n【38】 # IV Compatibility\nThere is limited information regarding IV Compatibility of Ceftizoxime in the drug label.\n\n【39】 # Overdosage\nThere is limited information regarding Overdose of Ceftizoxime in the drug label.\n\n【40】 # Pharmacology\n\n【41】 ## Mechanism of Action\n- The bactericidal action of ceftizoxime results from inhibition of cell­wall synthesis. Ceftizoxime is highly resistant to a broad spectrum of beta­lactamases (penicillinase and cephalosporinase), including Richmond types I, II, III, TEM, and IV, produced by both aerobic and anaerobic gram­positive and gram­negative organisms.\n\n【42】 ## Structure\n- Cefizox (ceftizoxime for injection, USP) is a sterile, semisynthetic, broad­spectrum, beta­lactamase resistant cephalosporin antibiotic for parenteral (IV, IM) administration. It is the sodium salt of ­7­ per gram of ceftizoxime activity.\n- It has the following structural formula:\n- Ceftizoxime for injection, USP is a white to pale yellow crystalline powder.\n- Cefizox is supplied in vials equivalent to 500 mg, 1 gram or 2 grams of ceftizoxime, and in Piggyback Vials for IV admixture equivalent to 1 gram or 2 grams of ceftizoxime.\n\n【43】 ## Pharmacodynamics\nThere is limited information regarding Pharmacodynamics of Ceftizoxime in the drug label.\n\n【44】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n- The below demonstrates the serum levels and duration of Cefizox (ceftizoxime for injection, USP) following IM administration of 500 mg and 1 gram doses, respectively, to normal volunteers.\n- A serum half­life of approximately 1.7 hours was observed after IV or IM administration.\n- Cefizox is 30% protein bound.\n- Cefizox is not metabolized, and is excreted virtually unchanged by the kidneys in 24 hours. This provides a high urinary concentration. Concentrations greater than 6000 μg/mL have been achieved in the urine by 2 hours after a 1 gram dose of Cefizox intravenously. Probenecid slows tubular secretion and produces even higher serum levels, increasing the duration of measurable serum concentrations.\n- Cefizox achieves therapeutic levels in various body fluids, e.g., cerebrospinal fluid (in patients with inflamed meninges), bile, surgical wound fluid, pleural fluid, aqueous humor, ascitic fluid, peritoneal fluid, prostatic fluid and saliva, and in the following body tissues: heart, gallbladder, bone, biliary, peritoneal, prostatic, and uterine.\n- In clinical experience to date, no disulfiram­like reactions have been reported with Cefizox.\n- The bactericidal action of ceftizoxime results from inhibition of cell­wall synthesis. Ceftizoxime is highly resistant to a broad spectrum of beta­lactamases (penicillinase and cephalosporinase), including Richmond types I, II, III, TEM, and IV, produced by both aerobic and anaerobic gram­positive and gram­negative organisms. Ceftizoxime has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section:\n- Staphylococcus aureus (including penicillinase producing strains)\n- NOTE: Methicillin­resistant staphylococci are resistant to cephalosporins, including ceftizoxime.\n- Staphylococcus epidermidis (including penicillinase producing strains)\n- Streptococcus agalactiae\n- Streptococcus pneumoniae\n- Streptococcus pyogenes\n- NOTE: A streptococcal isolate that is susceptible to penicillin can be considered susceptible to ceftizoxime.\n- NOTE: Ceftizoxime is usually inactive against most strains of Enterococcus faecalis.\n- Enterobacter spp.\n- Escherichia coli\n- Haemophilus influenzae (including ampicillin­resistant strains)\n- Klebsiella pneumoniae\n- Morganella morganii\n- Neisseria gonorrhoeae\n- Proteus mirabilis\n- Proteus vulgaris\n- Providencia rettgeri\n- Pseudomonas aeruginosa\n- Serratia marcescens\n- Bacteroides spp.\n- Peptococcus spp.\n- Peptostreptococcus spp.\n- The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90% of the following microorganisms exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for ceftizoxime. However, the safety and effectiveness of ceftizoxime in treating clinical infections due to these microorganisms have not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials.\n- Aeromonas hydrophila\n- Citrobacter spp.\n- Moraxellacatarrhalis\n- Neisseria meningitidis\n- Providencia stuartii\n- Quantitative methods are used to determine antimicrobial minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). These MICs provide estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The MICs should be determined using a standardized procedure. Standardized procedures are based on a dilution method1 (broth or agar) or equivalent with standardized inoculum concentrations and standardized concentrations of ceftizoxime powder. The MIC values should be interpreted according to the following criteria:\n provides a buffer zone, which prevents small-uncontrolled technical factors from causing major discrepancies in interpretation. A report of “Resistant” indicates that the pathogen is not likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the concentrations usually achievable, other therapy should be selected.\n- Standardized susceptibility test procedures require the use of laboratory control microorganisms to control the technical aspects of the laboratory procedures. Standard ceftizoxime powder should provide the following MIC values:\n provide reproducible estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. One such standardized procedure2 requires the use of standardized inoculum concentrations. This procedure uses paper disks impregnated with 30-μg ceftizoxime to test the susceptibility of microorganisms to ceftizoxime.\n- Reports from the laboratory providing results of the standard single-disk susceptibility test with a 30-μg ceftizoxime disk should be interpreted according to the following criteria:\n- Interpretation should be as stated above for results using dilution techniques. Interpretation involves correlation of the diameter obtained in the disk test with the MIC for ceftizoxime.\n- As with standardized dilution techniques, diffusion methods require the use of laboratory control microorganisms that are used to control the technical aspects of the laboratory procedures. For the diffusion technique, the 30-μg ceftizoxime disk should provide the following zone diameters in these laboratory test quality control strains:\n- For anaerobic bacteria, the susceptibility to ceftizoxime as MICs can be determined by standardized test methods. Agar dilution results can vary widely when using ceftizoxime. It is recommended that broth microdilution method be used when possible.3 The MIC values obtained should be interpreted according to following criteria:\n- Interpretation is identical to that described in Susceptibility Testing: Dilution Techniques.\n- As with other susceptibility techniques, the use of laboratory control microorganisms is required to control the technical aspects of the laboratory standardized procedures. Standardized ceftizoxime powder should provide the following MIC values:\n- Most strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa are moderately susceptible to ceftizoxime.\n- Ceftizoxime achieves high levels in the urine (greater than 6000 μg/mL at 2 hours with\n1 gram IV) and, therefore, the following zone sizes should be used when testing\nceftizoxime for treatment of urinary tract infections caused by Pseudomonas\naeruginosa.\n- Susceptible organisms produce zones of 20 mm or greater, indicating that the\ntest organism is likely to respond to therapy.\n- Organisms that produce zones of 11 to 19 mm are expected to be susceptible\nwhen the infection is confined to the urinary tract (in which high antibiotic levels\nare attained).\n- Resistant organisms produce zones of 10 mm or less, indicating that other\ntherapy should be selected.\n\n【45】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\n- Long­term studies in animals to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of ceftizoxime have not been conducted.\n- In an in vitro bacterial cell assay (i.e., Ames test), there was no evidence of mutagenicity at ceftizoxime concentrations of 0.001­0.5 mcg/plate. Ceftizoxime did not produce increases in micronuclei in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test when given to animals at doses up to 7500 mg/kg, approximately six times greater than the maximum human daily dose on a mg/M2 basis.\n- Ceftizoxime had no effect on fertility when administered subcutaneously to rats at daily doses of up to 1000 mg/kg/day, approximately two times the maximum human daily dose on a mg/M2 basis. Ceftizoxime produced no histological changes in the sexual organs of male and female dogs when given intravenously for thirteen weeks at a dose of 1000 mg/kg/day, approximately five times greater than the maximum human daily dose on a mg/M2 basis.\n\n【46】 # Clinical Studies\nThere is limited information regarding Clinical Studies of Ceftizoxime in the drug label.\n\n【47】 # How Supplied\n- Cefizox (ceftizoxime for injection, USP)\n- Equivalent to 500 mg ceftizoxime in 10 mL, single­dose, flip­top vials, individually\npackaged\n- Equivalent to 1 gram ceftizoxime in 20 mL, single­dose, flip­top vials, individually\npackaged\n- Equivalent to 1 gram ceftizoxime in 100 mL, single­dose, Piggyback, flip­top vials, packaged in tens\n- Equivalent to 2 grams ceftizoxime in 20 mL, single­dose, flip­top vials, individually packaged\n- Equivalent to 2 grams ceftizoxime in 100 mL, single­dose, Piggyback, flip­top vials, packaged in tens\n\n【48】 ## Storage\n- Unreconstituted Cefizox should be protected from excessive light, and stored at controlled room temperature (59º­86ºF) in the original package until used.\n\n【49】 # Images\n\n【50】 ## Drug Images\n\n【51】 ## Package and Label Display Panel\n\n【52】 ### Ingredients and Appearance\n\n【53】 # Patient Counseling Information\n- Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including Cefizox should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When Cefizox is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may  decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and  increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treaby Cefizox or other antibacterial drugs in the future.\n\n【54】 # Precautions with Alcohol\n- Alcohol-Ceftizoxime interaction has not been established.

{"seq_id": "53a83040-4015-4e46-8eff-c5009be23663", "title": null, "text": "【0】 Chromatin\nChromatin is the complex combination of DNA, RNA, and protein that makes up chromosomes. It is found inside the nuclei of eukaryotic cells, and within the nucleoid in prokaryotic cells. It is divided between heterochromatin (condensed) and euchromatin (extended) forms.\nThe major components of chromatin are DNA and histone proteins, although many other chromosomal proteins have prominent roles too. The functions of chromatin are to package DNA into a smaller volume to fit in the cell, to strengthen the DNA to allow mitosis and meiosis, and to serve as a mechanism to control expression and DNA replication. Chromatin contains genetic material-instructions to direct cell functions. Changes in chromatin structure are affected by chemical modifications of histone proteins such as methylation (DNA and proteins) and acetylation (proteins), and by non-histone, DNA-binding proteins.\nChromatin is easily visualised by staining, hence its name, which literally means coloured,lightend material.\n\n【1】 # Basic Structure\nSimplistically, there are seven levels of chromatin organization (Fig. :\n- DNA wrapping around nucleosomes - The \"beads on a string\" structure.\n- A 30 nm condensed chromatin fiber consisting of nucleosome arrays in their most compact form.\n- Higher level DNA packaging into the metaphase chromosome.\nThese structures do not occur in all reem prokaryotic cells. Examples of cells with more extreme packaging are spermatozoa and avian red blood cells.\nDuring spermiogenesis, the spermatid's chromatin is remodelled into a more spaced packaged, widened, almost crystal-like structure. This process is associated with the cessation of transcription and involves nuclear protein exchange. The histones are mostly displaced, and replaced by protamines (small, arginine-rich proteins). To put it simply, chromotins are the building blocks of proteins.\n be noted that during mitosis, while most of the chromatin is tightly compacted, there are small regions that are not as tightly compacted. These regions often correspond to promoter regions of genes that were active in that cell type prior to entry into cromitosis. The lack of compaction of these regiongs is called bookmarking, which is an epigenetic mechanism believed to be important for transmitting to daughter cells the \"memory\" of which genes were active prior to entry into mitosis. This bookmarking mechanism is needed to help transmit this memory because transcription ceases during mitosis.\nIt is found in a plant cell.\n\n【2】 # Levels of organization\n\n【3】 # During interphase\nThe structure of chromatin during interphase is optimised to allow easy access of transcription and DNA repair factors to the DNA while compacting the DNA into the nucleus. The structure varies depending on the access required to the DNA. Genes that require regular access by RNA polymerase require the looser structure provided by euchromatin.\n\n【4】 # Change in structure\nChromatin undergoes various forms of change in its structure. Histone proteins, the foundation blocks of chromatin, are modified by various post-translational modification to alter DNA packing. Acetylation results in the loosening of chromatin and lends itself to replication and transcription. When methylated they hold DNA together strongly and restrict access to various enzymes. A recent study showed that there is a bivalent structure present in the chromatin: methylated lysine residues at location 4 and 27 on histone 3. It is thought that this may be involved in development; there is more methylation of lysine 27 in embryonic cells than in differentiated cells, whereas lysine 4 methylation positively regulates transcription by recruiting nucleosome remodeling enzymes and histone acetylases.\nPolycomb-group proteins play a role in regulating genes through modulation of chromatin structure.\nFor additional information see Histone modifications in chromatin regulation and RNA polymerase control by chromatin structure\n\n【5】 ### DNA structure\nThe vast majority of DNA within the cell is the normal DNA structure. However in nature DNA can form three structures, A-, B- and Z-DNA. A and B chromosomes are very similar, forming right-handed helices, while Z-DNA is a more unusual left-handed helix with a zig-zag phosphate backbone. Z-DNA is thought to play a specific role in chromatin structure and transcription because of the properties of the junction between B- and Z-DNA.\nAt the junction of B- and Z-DNA one pair of bases is flipped out from normal bonding. These play a dual role of a site of recognition by many proteins and as a sink for torsional stress from RNA polymerase or nucleosome binding.\n\n【6】 ## The nucleosome and \"beads-on-a-string\"\nThe basic repeat element of chromatin is the nucleosome, interconnected by sections of linker DNA, a far shorter arrangement than pure DNA in solution.\nIn addition to the core histones there is the linker histone, H1, which contacts the exit/entry of the DNA strand on the nucleosome. The nucleosome, together with histone H1, is known as a chromatosome. Chromatosomes, connected by about 20 to 60 base pairs of linker DNA, form an approximately 10 nm \"beads-on-a-string\" fibre. (Fig. 1-.\nThe nucleosomes bind DNA non-specifically, as required by their function in general DNA packaging. There is, however, some preference in the sequences the nucleosomes will bind. This is largely through the properties of DNA; adenosine and thymine are more favorably compressed into the inner minor grooves. This means nucleosomes bind preferentially at one position every 10 base pairs - where the DNA is rotated to maximise the number of A and T bases which will lie in the inner minor groove. (\n\n【7】 ## 30 nm chromatin fibre\nThe \"beads-on-a-string\" structure in turn coils into a 30 nm diameter helical structure known as the 30nm fibre or filament. The precise structure of the chromatin fibre in the cell is not known in detail, and there is still some debate over this.\nThis level of chromatin structure is thought to be the form of euchromatin, which contains actively transcribed genes. EM studies have demonstrated that the 30 nm fibre is highly dynamic such that it unfolds into a 10 nm fiber (\"beads-on-a-string\") structure when transversed by an RNA polymerase engaged in transcription.\nThe existing models commonly accept that the nucleosomes lie perpendicular to the axis of the fibre, with linker histones arranged internally.  \nA s nm fibre relies on the regular positioning of nucleosomes along DNA. Linker DNA is relatively resistant to bending and rotation. This makes the length of linker DNA critical to the stability of the fibre, requiring nucleosomes to be separated by lengths that permit rotation and folding into the required orientation without excessive stress to the DNA.\nIn this view, different length of the linker DNA should produce different folding topologies of the chromatin fiber. Recent theoretical work, based on electron-microscopy images\n-f reconstituted fibers support this view.\n\n【8】 ## Spatial organization of chromatin in the cell nucleus\nHypothetical Model of the Territorial Organization of Chromatin in the Cell Nucleus. The (Fig.  represents a model of a cell (gray oval) with a nucleus (dark gray oval). Two chromosomes are shown as chromatin fibers (yellow and red lines). Proteins are represented as small ovals. Note the association of the chromatin components with the nuclear membrane. Chromosomes are territorially interlinked by chromatin protein complexes (scaffold proteins see above).]]\" --->\nThe layout of the genome within the nucleus is not random - specific regions of the genome are always found in certain areas. Specific regions of the chromatin are thought to be bound to the nuclear membrane, while other regions are bound together by protein complexes. The layout of this is not, however, well characterised apart from the compaction of one of the two X chromosomes in mammalian females into the Barr body. This serves the role of permanently deactivating these genes, which prevents females getting a 'double dose' of relative to males.\n\n【9】 # Metaphase chromatin\nThe metaphase structure of chromatin differs vastly to that of interphase. It is optimised for physical strength and manageability, forming the classic chromosome structure seen in karyotypes. The structure of the condensed chromosome is thought to be loops of 30nm fibre to a central scaffold of proteins. It is, however, not well characterised.\nThe physical strength of chromatin is vital for this stage of division to prevent shear damage to the DNA as the daughter chromosomes are separated. To maximise strength the composition of the chromatin changes as it approaches the centromere, primarily through alternative histone H1 anologues.\n\n【10】 # Non-histone chromosomal proteins\nThe proteins that are found associated with isolated chromatin fall into several functional categories:\n- chromatin-bound enzymes\n- high mobility group (HMG) proteins\n- transcription factors\n- scaffold proteins\n- transition proteins (testis specific proteins)\n- protamines (present in mature sperm)\nEnzymes associated with chromatin are those involved in DNA transcription, replication and repair, and in post-translational modification of histones. They include various types of nucleases and proteases. Scaffold proteins encompass chromatin proteins such as insulators, domain boundary factors and cellular memory modules (CMMs).\n\n【11】 # Chromatin: alternative definitions\n- Simple and concise definition: Chromatin is DNA plus the proteins (and RNA) that package DNA within the cell nucleus.\n- A biochemists’ operational definition: Chromatin is the DNA/protein/RNA complex extracted from eukaryotic lysed interphase nuclei. Just which of the multitudinous substances present in a nucleus will constitute a part of the extracted material will depend in part on the technique each researcher uses. Furthermore, the composition and properties of chromatin vary from one cell type to the another, during development of a specific cell type, and at different stages in the cell cycle.\n- The DNA – plus – histone – equals – chromatin definition: The DNA double helix in the cell nucleus is packaged by special proteins termed histones. The formed protein/DNA complex is called chromatin. The structural entity of chromatin is the nucleosome.\n\n【12】 # Nobel Prizes\nThe following scientists were recognized for their contributions to chromatin research with Nobel Prizes:", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

In the adult, the ureters are usually 25-30cm long.\nIn humans, the ureters enter the bladder through the back, running within the wall of the bladder for a few centimetres. There are no valves in the ureters, backflow being prevented by pressure from the filling of the bladder, as well as the tone of the muscle in the bladder wall.\nIn the female, the ureters pass through the mesometrium on the way to the urinary bladder.\n\n【2】 # Histology\nThe ureter has a diameter of about 3 millimeters, and the lumen is star-shaped. Like the bladder, it is lined with transitional epithelium, and contains layers of smooth muscle.\nThe epithelial cells of the ureter are stratified (in many layers), are normally round in shape but become squamous (flat) when stretched. The lamina propria is thick and elastic (as it is important that it is impermeable).\nThere are two spiral layers of smooth muscle in the ureter wall, an inner loose spiral, and an outer tight spiral. The inner loose spiral is sometimes described as longitudinal, and the outer as circular, (this is the opposite to the situation in the gastrointestinal tract).  The distal third of the ureter contains another layer of outer longitudinal muscle.\nThe adventitia of the ureter, like elsewhere is composed of fibrous connective tissue, that binds it to adjacent tissues.\n\n【3】 # Diseases and disorders\nMedical problems that can affect the ureter inclu\n- Cancer of the ureter\n- Passage of kidney stones\n- Ureterocele\n- Megaureter\n- Vesico-ureteric reflux\n- Anatomical abnormalities, such as duplexing and ectopia", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

It does the opposite as inhibin. Many other functions have been found to be exerted by activin, including their roles in cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, metabolism, homeostasis, immune response, wound repair, and endocrine function\nLike inhibin (and  AMH) activin belongs to TGF-β superfamily.\n\n【2】 # Structure\nActivin contains two beta subunit that are identical to the two beta subunits (A or B) of inhibin, allowing for the formation of three forms of activin: A, AB, and B.\nThey are linked by a single covalent disulfide bond.\n\n【3】 # Function\nActivin is produced in the gonads, pituitary gland, placenta and other organs:\n- In the ovarian follicle, activin increases FSH binding and FSH induced aromatization. It participates in androgen synthesis enhancing LH action in the ovary and testis. In the male, activin enhances spermatogenesis.\n- Activin is strongly expressed in wounded skin, and overexpression of activin in epidermis of transgenic mice improves wound healing and enhances scar formation.  Its action in wound repair and skin morphogenesis is through stimulation of keratinocytes and stromal cells in a dose-dependent manner.\n regulates the morphogenesis of branching organs such as the prostate, lung, and especially kidney.  Activin A increased the expression level of type I collagen suggesting that activtin A acts as a potent activator of fibroblasts.\n\n【4】 # Mechanism\nAs with other members of the superfamily, activins interact with two types of cell surface transmembrane receptors (Types I and II) which have intrinsic serine/threonine kinase activities in their cytoplasmic domains.\nActivin binds to the Type II receptor and initiates a cascade reaction that leads to the recruitment, phosphorylation, and activation of Type I activin receptor.  This then interacts with and then phosphorylates Smad2 and Smad3, two of the cytoplasmic Smad proteins.\nSmad3 then translocates to the nucleus and interacts with Smad4 through multimerization, resulting in their modulation as transcription factor complexes responsible for the expression of a large variety of genes.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Common adverse reactions include liver function abnormalities, nausea, arthralgia, and rash.\n\n【3】 # Adult Indications and Dosage\n\n【4】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Adult)\n- For treatment of hyperuricemia in patients with gout, ULORIC is recommended at 40 mg or 80 mg once daily.\n- The recommended starting dose of ULORIC is 40 mg once daily. For patients who do not achieve a serum uric acid (sUA) less than 6 mg/dL after two weeks with 40 mg, ULORIC 80 mg is recommended.\n- Gout Flares\n- Gout flares may occur after initiation of ULORIC due to changing serum uric acid levels resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits. Flare prophylaxis with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or colchicine is recommended upon initiation of ULORIC. Prophylactic therapy may be beneficial for up to six months.\n- If a gout flare occurs during ULORIC treatment, ULORIC need not be discontinued. The gout flare should be managed concurrently, as appropriate for the individual patient.\n\n【5】 ## Off-Label Use and Dosage (Adult)\n\n【6】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Febuxostat in adult patients.\n\n【7】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Febuxostat in adult patients.\n\n【8】 # Pediatric Indications and Dosage\n\n【9】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Pediatric)\nThere is limited information regarding FDA-Labeled Use of Febuxostat in pediatric patients.\n\n【10】 ## Off-Label Use and Dosage (Pediatric)\n\n【11】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Febuxostat in pediatric patients.\n\n【12】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Febuxostat in pediatric patients.\n\n【13】 # Contraindications\n- ULORIC is contraindicated in patients being treated with azathioprine or mercaptopurine.\n\n【14】 # Warnings\n\n【15】 ### Precautions\n- Gout Flare\n- After initiation of ULORIC, an increase in gout flares is frequently observed. This increase is due to reduction in serum uric acid levels, resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits.\n- In order to prevent gout flares when ULORIC is initiated, concurrent prophylactic treatment with an NSAID or colchicine is recommended.\n- Cardiovascular Events\n- In the randomized controlled studies, there was a higher rate of cardiovascular thromboembolic events (cardiovascular deaths, non-fatal myocardial infarctions, and non-fatal strokes) in patients treated with ULORIC (0.74 per 100 P-Y ) than allopurinol (0.60 per 100 P-Y ). A causal relationship with ULORIC has not been established. Monitor for signs and symptoms of myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke.\n- Hepatic Effects\n- There have been postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking ULORIC, although the reports contain insufficient information necessary to establish the probable cause. During randomized controlled studies, transaminase elevations greater than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN) were observed (AST: 2%, 2%, and ALT: 3%, 2% in ULORIC and allopurinol-treated patients, respectively). No dose-effect relationship for these transaminase elevations was noted.\n- Obtain a liver test panel (serum alanine aminotransferase , aspartate aminotransferase , alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) as a baseline before initiating ULORIC.\n- Measure liver tests promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine or jaundice. In this clinical context, if the patient is found to have abnormal liver tests (ALT greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range), ULORIC treatment should be interrupted and investigation done to establish the probable cause. ULORIC should not be restarted in these patients without another explanation for the liver test abnormalities.\n- Patients who have serum ALT greater than three times the reference range with serum total bilirubin greater than two times the reference range without alternative etiologies are at risk for severe drug-induced liver injury and should not be restarted on ULORIC. For patients with lesser elevations of serum ALT or bilirubin and with an alternate probable cause, treatment with ULORIC can be used with caution.\n\n【16】 # Adverse Reactions\n\n【17】 ## Clinical Trials Experience\n- Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.\n- A total of 2757 subjects with hyperuricemia and gout were treated with ULORIC 40 mg or 80 mg daily in clinical studies. For ULORIC 40 mg, 559 patients were treated for ≥6 months. For ULORIC 80 mg, 1377 subjects were treated for ≥6 months, 674 patients were treated for ≥1 year and 515 patients were treated for ≥2 years.\n- Most Common Adverse Reactions\n- In three randomized, controlled clinical studies (Studies 1, 2 and , which were six to 12 months in duration, the following adverse reactions were reported by the treating physician as related to study drug.  summarizes adverse reactions reported at a rate of at least 1% in ULORIC treatment groups and at least 0.5% greater than placebo.\n- The most common adverse reaction leading to discontinuation from therapy was liver function abnormalities in 1.8% of ULORIC 40 mg, 1.2% of ULORIC 80 mg, and in 0.9% of allopurinol-treated subjects.\n- In addition to the adverse reactions presented in , dizziness was reported in more than 1% of ULORIC-treated subjects although not at a rate more than 0.5% greater than placebo.\n- Less Common Adverse Reactions\n includes adverse reactions (less than 1% of subjects) associated with organ systems from Warnings and Precautions.\nAnemia, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, leukocytosis/leukopenia, neutropenia, pancytopenia, splenomegaly, thrombocytopenia.\nAngina pectoris, atrial fibrillation/flutter, cardiac murmur, ECG abnormal, palpitations, sinus bradycardia, tachycardia.\nDeafness, tinnitus, vertigo.\nVision blurred.\nAbdominal distention, abdominal pain, constipation, dry mouth, dyspepsia, flatulence, frequent stools, gastritis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, gastrointestinal discomfort, gingival pain, haematemesis, hyperchlorhydria, hematochezia, mouth ulceration, pancreatitis, peptic ulcer, vomiting.\nAsthenia, chest pain/discomfort, edema, fatigue, feeling abnormal, gait disturbance, influenza-like symptoms, mass, pain, thirst.\nCholelithiasis/cholecystitis, hepatic steatosis, hepatitis, hepatomegaly.\nHypersensitivity.\nHerpes zoster.\nContusion.\nAnorexia, appetite decreased/increased, dehydration, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hypokalemia, weight decreased/increased.\nArthritis, joint stiffness, joint swelling, muscle spasms/twitching/tightness/weakness, musculoskeletal pain/stiffness, myalgia.\nAltered taste, balance disorder, cerebrovascular accident, Guillain-Barré syndrome, headache, hemiparesis, hypoesthesia, hyposmia, lacunar infarction, lethargy, mental impairment, migraine, paresthesia, somnolence, transient ischemic attack, tremor.\nAgitation, anxiety, depression, insomnia, irritability, libido decreased, nervousness, panic attack, personality change.\nHematuria, nephrolithiasis, pollakiuria, proteinuria, renal failure, renal insufficiency, urgency, incontinence.\nBreast pain, erectile dysfunction, gynecomastia.\nBronchitis, cough, dyspnea, epistaxis, nasal dryness, paranasal sinus hypersecretion, pharyngeal edema, respiratory tract congestion, sneezing, throat irritation, upper respiratory tract infection.\nAlopecia, angio-edema, dermatitis, dermographism, ecchymosis, eczema, hair color changes, hair growth abnormal, hyperhidrosis, peeling skin, petechiae, photosensitivity, pruritus, purpura, skin discoloration/altered pigmentation, skin lesion, skin odor abnormal, urticaria.\nFlushing, hot flush, hypertension, hypotension.\nActivated partial thromboplastin time prolonged, creatine increased, bicarbonate decreased, sodium increased, EEG abnormal, glucose increased, cholesterol increased, triglycerides increased, amylase increased, potassium increased, TSH increased, platelet count decreased, hematocrit decreased, hemoglobin decreased, MCV increased, RBC decreased, creatinine increased, blood urea increased, BUN/creatinine ratio increased, creatine phosphokinase (CPK) increased, alkaline phosphatase increased, LDH increased, PSA increased, urine output increased/decreased, lymphocyte count decreased, neutrophil count decreased, WBC increased/decreased, coagulation test abnormal, low density lipoprotein (LDL) increased, prothrombin time prolonged, urinary casts, urine positive for white blood cells and protein.\n\n【18】 ## Postmarketing Experience\n- Adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of ULORIC. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship.\nHepatic failure (some fatal), jaundice, serious cases of abnormal liver function test results, liver disorder.\nAnaphylaxis, anaphylactic reaction.\nRhabdomyolysis.\nPsychotic behavior including aggressive thoughts.\nTubulointerstitial nephritis.\nGeneralized rash, Stevens Johnson Syndrome, hypersensitivity skin reactions.\n\n【19】 # Drug Interactions\n- Xanthine Oxidase Substrate Drugs\n- ULORIC is an XO inhibitor. Based on a drug interaction study in healthy subjects, febuxostat altered the metabolism of theophylline (a substrate of XO) in humans. Therefore, use with caution when coadministering ULORIC with theophylline.\n- Drug interaction studies of ULORIC with other drugs that are metabolized by XO (e.g., mercaptopurine and azathioprine) have not been conducted. Inhibition of XO by ULORIC may cause increased plasma concentrations of these drugs leading to toxicity. ULORIC is contraindicated in patients being treated with azathioprine or mercaptopurine.\n- Cytotoxic Chemotherapy Drugs\n- Drug interaction studies of ULORIC with cytotoxic chemotherapy have not been conducted. No data are available regarding the safety of ULORIC during cytotoxic chemotherapy.\n- In Vivo Drug Interaction Studies\n- Based on drug interaction studies in healthy subjects, ULORIC does not have clinically significant interactions with colchicine, naproxen, indomethacin, hydrochlorothiazide, warfarin or desipramine. Therefore, ULORIC may be used concomitantly with these medications.\n\n【20】 # Use in Specific Populations\n\n【21】 ### Pregnancy\nPregnancy Category (FDA):\n- Pregnancy Category C\n- There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. ULORIC should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\n- Febuxostat was not teratogenic in rats and rabbits at oral doses up to 48 mg/kg (40 and 51 times the human plasma exposure at 80 mg/day for equal body surface area, respectively) during organogenesis. However, increased neonatal mortality and a reduction in the neonatal body weight gain were observed when pregnant rats were treated with oral doses up to 48 mg/kg (40 times the human plasma exposure at 80 mg/day) during organogenesis and through lactation period.\nPregnancy Category (AUS):\n- Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) Pregnancy Category\nThere is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Febuxostat in women who are pregnant.\n\n【22】 ### Labor and Delivery\nThere is no FDA guidance on use of Febuxostat during labor and delivery.\n\n【23】 ### Nursing Mothers\n- Febuxostat is excreted in the milk of rats. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when ULORIC is administered to a nursing woman.\n\n【24】 ### Pediatric Use\n- Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients under 18 years of age have not been established.\n\n【25】 ### Geriatic Use\n- No dose adjustment is necessary in elderly patients. Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of ULORIC, 16% were 65 and over, while 4% were 75 and over. Comparing subjects in different age groups, no clinically significant differences in safety or effectiveness were observed but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. The Cmax and AUC24 of febuxostat following multiple oral doses of ULORIC in geriatric subjects (≥65 years) were similar to those in younger subjects (18 to 40 years).\n\n【26】 ### Gender\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Febuxostat with respect to specific gender populations.\n\n【27】 ### Race\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Febuxostat with respect to specific racial populations.\n\n【28】 ### Renal Impairment\n- No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (Clcr 30 to 89 mL/min). The recommended starting dose of ULORIC is 40 mg once daily. For patients who do not achieve a sUA less than 6 mg/dL after two weeks with 40 mg, ULORIC 80 mg is recommended.\n- There are insufficient data in patients with severe renal impairment (Clcr less than 30 mL/min); therefore, caution should be exercised in these patients.\n\n【29】 ### Hepatic Impairment\n- No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A or B). No studies have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C); therefore, caution should be exercised in these patients.\n\n【30】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Febuxostat in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n\n【31】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\nThere is no FDA guidance one the use of Febuxostat in patients who are immunocompromised.\n\n【32】 # Administration and Monitoring\n\n【33】 ### Administration\n- Oral\n\n【34】 ### Monitoring\nThere is limited information regarding Monitoring of Febuxostat in the drug label.\n\n【35】 # IV Compatibility\nThere is limited information regarding IV Compatibility of Febuxostat in the drug label.\n\n【36】 # Overdosage\n\n【37】 ## Acute Overdose\n\n【38】 ### Signs and Symptoms\n- ULORIC was studied in healthy subjects in doses up to 300 mg daily for seven days without evidence of dose-limiting toxicities. No overdose of ULORIC was reported in clinical studies.\n\n【39】 ### Management\n- Patients should be managed by symptomatic and supportive care should there be an overdose.\n\n【40】 ## Chronic Overdose\nThere is limited information regarding Chronic Overdose of Febuxostat in the drug label.\n\n【41】 # Pharmacology\n\n【42】 ## Mechanism of Action\n- ULORIC, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, achieves its therapeutic effect by decreasing serum uric acid. ULORIC is not expected to inhibit other enzymes involved in purine and pyrimidine synthesis and metabolism at therapeutic concentrations.\n\n【43】 ## Structure\n- ULORIC (febuxostat) is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor. The active ingredient in ULORIC is 2--4-methylthiazole-5-carboxylic acid, with a molecular weight of 316.38. The empirical formula is C16H16N2O3S.\n- Febuxostat is a non-hygroscopic, white crystalline powder that is freely soluble in dimethylformamide; soluble in dimethylsulfoxide; sparingly soluble in ethanol; slightly soluble in methanol and acetonitrile; and practically insoluble in water. The melting range is 205°C to 208°C.\n- ULORIC ts for oral use contain the active ingredient, febuxostat, and are available in two dosage strengths, 40 mg and 80 mg. Inactive ingredients include lactose monohydrate, microcrystalline cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, sodium croscarmellose, silicon dioxide and magnesium stearate. ULORIC ts are coated with Opadry II, green.\n\n【44】 ## Pharmacodynamics\n- Effect on Uric Acid and Xanthine Concentrations: In healthy subjects, ULORIC resulted in a dose dependent decrease in 24-hour mean serum uric acid concentrations and an increase in 24-hour mean serum xanthine concentrations. In addition, there was a decrease in the total daily urinary uric acid excretion. Also, there was an increase in total daily urinary xanthine excretion. Percent reduction in 24-hour mean serum uric acid concentrations was between 40% and 55% at the exposure levels of 40 mg and 80 mg daily doses.\n- Effect on Cardiac Repolarization: The effect of ULORIC on cardiac repolarization as assessed by the QTc interval was evaluated in normal healthy subjects and in patients with gout. ULORIC in doses up to 300 mg daily, at steady-state, did not demonstrate an effect on the QTc interval.\n\n【45】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n- In healthy subjects, maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) and AUC of febuxostat increased in a dose proportional manner following single and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg. There is no accumulation when therapeutic doses are administered every 24 hours. Febuxostat has an apparent mean terminal elimination half-life (t1/ of approximately 5 to 8 hours. Febuxostat pharmacokinetic parameters for patients with hyperuricemia and gout estimated by population pharmacokinetic analyses were similar to those estimated in healthy subjects.\n- Absorption\n- The absorption of radiolabeled febuxostat following oral dose administration was estimated to be at least 49% (based on total radioactivity recovered in urine). Maximum plasma concentrations of febuxostat occurred between 1 and 1.5 hours post-dose. After multiple oral 40 mg and 80 mg once daily doses, Cmax is approximately 1.6 ± 0.6 mcg/mL (N=, and 2.6 ± 1.7 mcg/mL (N=, respectively. Absolute bioavailability of the febuxostat t has not been studied.\n- Following multiple 80 mg once daily doses with a high fat meal, there was a 49% decrease in Cmax and an 18% decrease in AUC, respectively. However, no clinically significant change in the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was observed (58% fed vs. 51% fasting). Thus, ULORIC may be taken without regard to food.\n- Concomitant ingestion of an antacid containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide with an 80 mg single dose of ULORIC has been shown to delay absorption of febuxostat (approximately one hour) and to cause a 31% decrease in Cmax and a 15% decrease in AUC∞. As AUC rather than Cmax was related to drug effect, change observed in AUC was not considered clinically significant. Therefore, ULORIC may be taken without regard to antacid use.\n- Distribution\n- The mean apparent steady state volume of distribution (Vss/F) of febuxostat was approximately 50 L (CV ~40%). The plasma protein binding of febuxostat is approximately 99.2% (primarily to albumin), and is constant over the concentration range achieved with 40 mg and 80 mg doses.\n- Metabolism\n- Febuxostat is extensively metabolized by both conjugation via uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes including UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7 and oxidation via cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes including CYP1A2, 2C8 and 2C9 and non-P450 enzymes. The relative contribution of each enzyme isoform in the metabolism of febuxostat is not clear. The oxidation of the isobutyl side chain leads to the formation of four pharmacologically active hydroxy metabolites, all of which occur in plasma of humans at a much lower extent than febuxostat.\n- In urine and feces, acyl glucuronide metabolites of febuxostat (~35% of the dose), and oxidative metabolites, 67M-1 (~10% of the dose), 67M-2 (~11% of the dose), and 67M-4, a secondary metabolite from 67M-1 (~14% of the dose), appeared to be the major metabolites of febuxostat in vivo.\n- Elimination\n- Febuxostat is eliminated by both hepatic and renal pathways. Following an 80 mg oral dose of 14C-labeled febuxostat, approximately 49% of the dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged febuxostat (3%), the acyl glucuronide of the drug (30%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (13%), and other unknown metabolites (3%). In addition to the urinary excretion, approximately 45% of the dose was recovered in the feces as the unchanged febuxostat (12%), the acyl glucuronide of the drug (1%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (25%), and other unknown metabolites (7%).\n- The apparent mean terminal elimination half-life (t1/ of febuxostat was approximately 5 to 8 hours.\n- Special Populations\n- Pediatric Use: The pharmacokinetics of ULORIC in patients under the age of 18 years have not been studied.\n- Geriatric Use: The Cmax and AUC of febuxostat and its metabolites following multiple oral doses of ULORIC in geriatric subjects (≥65 years) were similar to those in younger subjects (18 to 40 years). In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was similar between elderly and younger subjects. No dose adjustment is necessary in geriatric patients.\n- Renal Impairment\n- Following multiple 80 mg doses of ULORIC in healthy subjects with mild (Clcr 50 to 80 mL/min), moderate (Clcr 30 to 49 mL/min) or severe renal impairment (Clcr 10 to 29 mL/min), the Cmax of febuxostat did not change relative to subjects with normal renal function (Clcr greater than 80 mL/min). AUC and half-life of febuxostat increased in subjects with renal impairment in comparison to subjects with normal renal function, but values were similar among three renal impairment groups. Mean febuxostat AUC values were up to 1.8 times higher in subjects with renal impairment compared to those with normal renal function. Mean Cmax and AUC values for three active metabolites increased up to 2- and 4-fold, respectively. However, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration for subjects with renal impairment was comparable to those with normal renal function (58% in normal renal function group and 55% in the severe renal function group).\n- No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. The recommended starting dose of ULORIC is 40 mg once daily. For patients who do not achieve a sUA less than 6 mg/dL after two weeks with 40 mg, ULORIC 80 mg is recommended. There is insufficient data in patients with severe renal impairment; caution should be exercised in those patients.\n- ULORIC has not been studied in end stage renal impairment patients who are on dialysis.\n- Hepatic Impairment: Following multiple 80 mg doses of ULORIC in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment, an average of 20% to 30% increase was observed for both Cmax and AUC24 (total and unbound) in hepatic impairment groups compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was comparable between different hepatic groups (62% in healthy group, 49% in mild hepatic impairment group, and 48% in moderate hepatic impairment group). No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. No studies have been conducted in subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C); caution should be exercised in those patients.\n- Gender: Following multiple oral doses of ULORIC, the Cmax and AUC24 of febuxostat were 30% and 14% higher in females than in males, respectively. However, weight-corrected Cmax and AUC were similar between the genders. In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentrations was similar between genders. No dose adjustment is necessary based on gender.\n- Race: No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate the effects of race.\n- Drug-Drug Interactions\n- Effect of ULORIC on Other Drugs\n- Xanthine Oxidase Substrate Drugs-Azathioprine, Mercaptopurine, and Theophylline\n- Febuxostat is an XO inhibitor. A drug-drug interaction study evaluating the effect of ULORIC upon the pharmacokinetics of theophylline (an XO substrate) in healthy subjects showed that coadministration of febuxostat with theophylline resulted in an approximately 400-fold increase in the amount of 1-methylxanthine, one of the major metabolites of theophylline, excreted in the urine. Since the long-term safety of exposure to 1-methylxanthine in humans is unknown, use with caution when coadministering febuxostat with theophylline.\n- Drug interaction studies of ULORIC with other drugs that are metabolized by XO (e.g., mercaptopurine and azathioprine) have not been conducted. Inhibition of XO by ULORIC may cause increased plasma concentrations of these drugs leading to toxicity. ULORIC is contraindicated in patients being treated with azathioprine or mercaptopurine.\n- Azathioprine and mercaptopurine undergo metabolism via three major metabolic pathways, one of which is mediated by XO. Although ULORIC drug interaction studies with azathioprine and mercaptopurine have not been conducted, concomitant administration of allopurinol  with azathioprine or mercaptopurine has been reported to substantially increase plasma concentrations of these drugs. Because ULORIC is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, it could inhibit the XO-mediated metabolism of azathioprine and mercaptopurine leading to increased plasma concentrations of azathioprine or mercaptopurine that could result in severe toxicity.\n- P450 Substrate Drugs\n does not induce CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 at clinically relevant concentrations. As such, pharmacokinetic interactions between ULORIC and drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes are unlikely.\n- Effect of Other Drugs on ULORIC\n- Febuxostat is metabolized by conjugation and oxidation via multiple metabolizing enzymes. The relative contribution of each enzyme isoform is not clear. Drug interactions between ULORIC and a drug that inhibits or induces one particular enzyme isoform is in general not expected.\n- In Vivo Drug Interaction Studies\n showed an approximately 400-fold increase in the amount of 1-methylxanthine (one of the major theophylline metabolites) excreted in urine as a result of XO inhibition by ULORIC. The safety of long-term exposure to 1-methylxanthine has not been evaluated. This should be taken into consideration when deciding to coadminister ULORIC and theophylline.\n- Colchicine: No dose adjustment is necessary for either ULORIC or colchicine when the two drugs are coadministered. Administration of ULORIC (40 mg once daily) with colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily) resulted in an increase of 12% in Cmax and 7% in AUC24 of febuxostat. In addition, administration of colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily) with ULORIC (120 mg daily) resulted in a less than 11% change in Cmax or AUC of colchicine for both AM and PM doses. These changes were not considered clinically significant.\n- Naproxen: No dose adjustment is necessary for ULORIC or naproxen when the two drugs are coadministered. Administration of ULORIC (80 mg once daily) with naproxen (500 mg twice daily) resulted in a 28% increase in Cmax and a 40% increase in AUC of febuxostat. The increases were not considered clinically significant. In addition, there were no significant changes in the Cmax or AUC of naproxen (less than 2%).\n- Indomethacin: No dose adjustment is necessary for either ULORIC or indomethacin when these two drugs are coadministered. Administration of ULORIC (80 mg once daily) with indomethacin (50 mg twice daily) did not result in any significant changes in Cmax or AUC of febuxostat or indomethacin (less than 7%).\n- Hydrochlorothiazi\n not affected by the coadministration of ULORIC.\n- Desipramine: Coadministration of drugs that are CYP2D6 substrates (such as desipramine) with ULORIC are not expected to require dose adjustment. Febuxostat was shown to be a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6 in vitro and in vivo. Administration of ULORIC (120 mg once daily) with desipramine (25 mg) resulted in an increase in Cmax (16%) and AUC (22%) of desipramine, which was associated with a 17% decrease in the 2-hydroxydesipramine to desipramine metabolic ratio (based on AUC).\n\n【46】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\n- Carcinogenesis: Two-year carcinogenicity studies were conducted in F344 rats and B6C3F1 mice. Increased transitional cell papilloma and carcinoma of urinary bladder was observed at 24 mg/kg (25 times the human plasma exposure at maximum recommended human dose of 80 mg/day) and 18.75 mg/kg (12.5 times the human plasma exposure at 80 mg/day) in male rats and female mice, respectively. The urinary bladder neoplasms were secondary to calculus formation in the kidney and urinary bladder.\n- Mutagenesis: Febuxostat showed a positive mutagenic response in a chromosomal aberration assay in a Chinese hamster lung fibroblast cell line with and without metabolic activation in vitro. Febuxostat was negative in the in vitro Ames assay and chromosomal aberration test in human peripheral lymphocytes, and L5178Y mouse lymphoma cell line, and in vivo tests in mouse micronucleus, rat unscheduled DNA synthesis and rat bone marrow cells.\n- Impairment of Fertility: Febuxostat at oral doses up to 48 mg/kg/day (approximately 35 times the human plasma exposure at 80 mg/day) had no effect on fertility and reproductive performance of male and female rats.\n- A 12-month toxicity study in beagle dogs showed deposition of xanthine crystals and calculi in kidneys at 15 mg/kg (approximately four times the human plasma exposure at 80 mg/day). A similar effect of calculus formation was noted in rats in a six-month study due to deposition of xanthine crystals at 48 mg/kg (approximately 35 times the human plasma exposure at 80 mg/day).\n\n【47】 # Clinical Studies\n- A serum uric acid level of less than 6 mg/dL is the goal of anti-hyperuricemic therapy and has been established as appropriate for the treatment of gout.\n- The efficacy of ULORIC was demonstrated in three randomized, double-blind, controlled trials in patients with hyperuricemia and gout. Hyperuricemia was defined as a baseline serum uric acid level ≥8 mg/dL.\n- Study 1 randomized patients to: ULORIC 40 mg daily, ULORIC 80 mg daily, or allopurinol (300 mg daily for patients with estimated creatinine clearance (Clcr) ≥60 mL/min or 200 mg daily for patients with estimated Clcr ≥30 mL/min and ≤59 mL/min). The duration of Study 1 was six months.\n- Study 2 randomized patients to: placebo, ULORIC 80 mg daily, ULORIC 120 mg daily, ULORIC 240 mg daily or allopurinol (300 mg daily for patients with a baseline serum creatinine ≤1.5 mg/dL or 100 mg daily for patients with a baseline serum creatinine greater than 1.5 mg/dL and ≤2 mg/dL). The duration of Study 2 was six months.\n- Study 3, a 1-year study, randomized patients to: ULORIC 80 mg daily, ULORIC 120 mg daily, or allopurinol 300 mg daily. Subjects who completed Study 2 and Study 3 were eligible to enroll in a phase 3 long-term extension study in which subjects received treatment with ULORIC for over three years.\n- In all three studies, subjects received naproxen 250 mg twice daily or colchicine 0.6 mg once or twice daily for gout flare prophylaxis. In Study 1 the duration of prophylaxis was six months; in Study 2 and Study 3 the duration of prophylaxis was eight weeks.\n evaluated in a four week dose ranging study which randomized patients to: placebo, ULORIC 40 mg daily, ULORIC 80 mg daily, or ULORIC 120 mg daily. Subjects who completed this study were eligible to enroll in a long-term extension study in which subjects received treatment with ULORIC for up to five years.\n- Patients in these studies were representative of the patient population for which ULORIC use is intended.  summarizes the demographics and baseline characteristics for the subjects enrolled in the studies.\n- Serum Uric Acid Level less than 6 mg/dL at Final Vis\n- In 76% of ULORIC 80 mg patients, reduction in serum uric acid levels to less than 6 mg/dL was noted by the Week 2 visit. Average serum uric acid levels were maintained at 6 mg/dL or below throughout treatment in 83% of these patients.\n- In all treatment groups, fewer subjects with higher baseline serum urate levels (≥10 mg/dL) and/or tophi achieved the goal of lowering serum uric acid to less than 6 mg/dL at the final visit; however, a higher proportion achieved a serum uric acid less than 6 mg/dL with ULORIC 80 mg than with ULORIC 40 mg or allopurinol.\n- Study 1 evaluated efficacy in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (i.e., baseline estimated Clcr less than 90 mL/min).

{"seq_id": "87875aa9-0a53-4a22-936b-02859634a07b", "title": null, "text": "【0】 Palforzia for treating peanut allergy in children and young people\n\n【1】 Evidence-based recommendations on Palforzia for treating peanut allergy in children and young people.\n\n【2】 # Recommendations\nPalforzia is recommended, within its marketing authorisation, as an option for treating peanut allergy in children aged 4 to 17. It can be continued in people who turn 18 while on treatment. Palforzia should be used with a peanut-avoidant diet.\nWhy the committee made these recommendations\nFor people with peanut allergy, strictly avoiding peanuts and being ready to respond to an emergency are the main ways to protect against reactions to accidental exposure.\nClinical trial evidence shows that Palforzia improves tolerance to peanut protein compared with placebo when precise amounts are used in a food challenge test. And it is likely that Palforzia improves people's quality of life once they are having a sdose. People are likely to need to take Palforzia or regularly include peanuts in their diet to maintain the tolerance they gained. It is uncertain how long people would continue treatment, but few are likely to need to continue Palforzia for the rest of their lives.\nThe most likely cost-effectiveness estimates are within the range that NICE normally considers an accepuse of NHS resources. Also, additional benefits of Palforzia may not have been captured in the cost-effectiveness results. So, Palforzia is recommended.# Information about Palforzia\n\n【3】 # Marketing authorisation indication\nPalforzia is indicated 'for the treatment of patients aged 4 to 17 years with a confirmed diagnosis of peanut allergy. Palforzia may be continued in patients aged 18 years or older. Palforzia should be used in conjunction with a peanut-avoidant diet'.\n\n【4】 # Dosage in the marketing authorisation\nThe dosage schedule is available in the summary of product characteristics for palforzia.\n\n【5】 The list price of Palforzia is £10.12 per day. A flat price is applied for each Palforzia dose (range 0.5 mg to 300 mg).# Committee discussion\n the committee papers for full details of the evidence.\n\n【6】 # Clinical need and treatment pathway\n\n【7】 ## Peanut allergy burdens patients and their carers\nPeanut allergy is one of the most common food allergies in children, affecting between 0.5% and 2% of children in the UK. Severe reactions, notably anaphylaxis, can be life threatening, although deaths from peanut allergy-related anaphylaxis are very rare in the UK. Symptoms can have a rapid onset. They can include angioedema (facial swelling), respiratory symptoms (wheezing), conjunctivitis, oral allergy syndrome (lip or tongue swelling), rhinitis (blocked nose) and urticaria (blotchy red rash). It is not possible to predict the likelihood or severity of future allergic reactions based on previous reactions. Patient experts explained that peanut allergy affects 'all aspects of daily life' and 'can cause extreme anxiety' for children and young people with the allergy and their carers. It can have implications for shopping and preparing food, weaning infants, eating out, travelling, seasonal events, education, socialising and work. Parents may experience anxiety, in particular around the time their children start secondary school or leave home. The committee concluded that peanut allergy burdens patients and their carers.\n\n【8】 ## There is a need for preventive treatment options for peanut allergy\nThe goal of treatment for peanut allergy is preventive, that is, to reduce the frequency and severity of allergic reactions and improve quality of life, to lessen anxiety and to normalise activities of daily living. The main preventive strategy for peanut allergy is strictly avoiding peanuts and being ready to respond to an emergency. Symptomatic treatment of mild reactions to accidental peanut exposure includes antihistamines, whereas severe anaphylactic reactions need emergency treatment including self-administered adrenaline. Clinical experts explained that strictly avoiding peanuts cannot be considered the only option, and active preventive treatments are needed to reduce the risks of accidental peanut exposure. They noted that most accidental exposures involve less than 300 mg of peanut protein. Tolerating this amount, equivalent to roughly 1.5 peanuts, would give 'bite protection' from small accidental exposures to peanut and would be a 'meaningful outcome'. Tolerating 1,000 mg of peanut protein is considered to be 'highly clinically significant'. The committee concluded that clinicians and people affected by peanut allergy would welcome a treatment option that would reduce the risks of accidental peanut exposure and improve quality of life of children with peanut allergy and their carers.\n\n【9】 ## Lifetime treatment with Palforzia or regularly including peanuts in the diet is needed to maintain tolerance\n states that no recommendation can be made about the duration of treatment beyond 24 months, and that the effect of stopping treatment on maintenance of clinical efficacy has not been evaluated. The clinical experts explained that people not regularly including peanuts in their diet after Palforzia treatment may lose tolerance and will need to return to strictly avoiding peanuts and being prepared for emergencies. They added that whether or not people keep peanuts in their diet after Palforzia treatment may be linked to taste aversion, motivation, adverse effects, restrictions around meals and exercise, and support received. The patient experts anticipated that people will be highly motivated to include peanuts in their diet after committing to Palforzia treatment, but noted that some may be averse to the taste of peanuts. Moreover, there may be psychological stress and anxiety associated with eating a food that people have diligently avoided and greatly feared for many years. The patient experts explained that people with peanut allergy and their carers may require additional psychological support during the transition. The committee concluded that people would need lifetime treatment with Palforzia or to regularly include peanuts in their diet to maintain tolerance to peanuts.\n\n【10】 ## Strict peanut avoidance is the most appropriate comparator\nPalforzia is used 'in conjunction with a peanut-avoidant diet', in line with its marketing authorisation. The company selected strict peanut avoidance as the only comparator for Palforzia. The committee agreed, concluding that strict peanut avoidance was the most appropriate comparator for Palforzia.\n\n【11】 # Clinical evidence\n\n【12】 ## An oral food challenge is clinically relevant and an appropriate surrogate end point\nThe committee recalled that 1 of the treatment goals is to reduce the risks associated with accidental peanut exposure  section 3.. Reactions to accidental exposures are uncommon, with 1 study suggesting an annual incidence of around 12%. Therefore, clinical trials use oral food challenges as a surrogate end point. In an oral food challenge, people are given increasing doses of precise amounts of peanut protein to assess their tolerance to the allergen. Their maximum tolerated dose, or 'tolerability threshold', is the highest dose tolerated with no more than mild symptoms. Having some tolerance to peanut protein can protect from risks of accidental exposure to peanut. The committee recalled that tolerating 1,000 mg peanut protein is considered clinically significant. The committee agreed that tolerance to peanut protein measured during oral food challenge is clinically relevant, and reflects an appropriate surrogate end point for assessing the efficacy of Palforzia.\n\n【13】 ## Palforzia was studied in 2 phase 3 trials that are generalisable to NHS practice\nPalforzia was studied in 2 randomised controlled trials conducted in North America and Europe, including the UK. All people had peanut allergy confirmed by peanut-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) reactivity and skin prick test. All participants had an entry food challenge at screening to select people who had dose-limiting symptoms to peanut protein at a dose of 100 mg or less in PALISADE, and 300 mg or less in ARTEMIS. PALISADE enrolled people aged 4 to 55 years (n=, and ARTEMIS enrolled people aged 4 to 17 years (n=. People were randomised to receive Palforzia while avoiding peanuts, or placebo while avoiding peanuts. Treatment with Palforzia was given in 3 phases:\nAn 'escalation phase', which consisted of 5 dose levels (0.5 mg to 6 mg), all given on day 1 of treatment.\nAn 'up-dosing phase', which had 11 dose levels lasting 2 weeks each (3 mg to 300 mg).\n explained that people in NHS practice would follow the same dosing schedule as in the trials. The committee concluded that PALISADE and ARTEMIS are generalisable to NHS practice.\n\n【14】 ## Palforzia improves tolerance to peanut protein compared with placebo\nCompared with placebo, Palforzia increased the proportion of people who could tolerate at least 1,000 mg peanut protein. Among people aged 4 to 17 years, the proportion of people tolerating at least 1,000 mg peanut protein was:\n% of people randomised to Palforzia versus 2.4% of people randomised to placebo in PALISADE (absolute treatment difference 48.7%; 95% confidence interval 38.0% to 57.7%; p<0.\n% versus 2.3% of people, respectively, in ARTEMIS (absolute treatment difference 56.0%; 95% confidence interval 44.1% to 65.2%; p<0..These findings were supported by the key secondary outcomes of tolerating at least 600 mg or at least 300 mg peanut protein. The committee concluded that Palforzia improved tolerance to peanut protein in people aged 4 to 17 years with peanut allergy compared with placebo.\n\n【15】 ## There is no direct clinical trial evidence that Palforzia reduces the frequency and severity of reactions to accidental peanut exposure\n that treatment with Palforzia increases the risk of anaphylactic reactions as an adverse event of treatment  section 3.. A clinical expert noted that although there is no direct evidence that Palforzia 'prevents anaphylaxis' following accidental exposure, there is evidence from clinical trials that the maximum severity of symptoms at the exit oral food challenge was lower with Palforzia than with placebo. The committee concluded that there is no direct clinical trial evidence that Palforzia reduces the frequency and severity of reactions to accidental peanut exposure.\n\n【16】 ## Palforzia may increase the risk of treatment-related anaphylactic reactions, but the risk of severe anaphylaxis is low\nPeople who had Palforzia had more adverse events affecting the gastrointestinal tract, respiratory tract, skin, and immune system than those who received placebo. Severe or serious treatment-emergent adverse events were rare. The committee noted that mild and moderate anaphylactic reactions as an adverse event of treatment (not because of accidental peanut exposure) were more common with Palforzia than with placebo, but severe anaphylactic reactions were rare – only 1 patient in the Palforzia group and 2 patients in the placebo group had severe anaphylaxis in PALISADE, and none in ARTEMIS. In both trials, more people on Palforzia stopped treatment because of treatment-emergent adverse events than did people taking placebo. The committee concluded that Palforzia may increase the risk of treatment-related reactions, although the risk of severe anaphylaxis is low.\n\n【17】 ## The committee would prefer a meta-analysis, but this would not have a meaningful impact on the results\n noted that the company did not consider a phase 2 study, the ARC001 trial. The company explained that it excluded this study because it had only 55 participants and was done solely in the US. The ERG accepted that including this study would not add much insight. The committee agreed with the ERG that despite differences between trials, there were several ways in which the company could have done a meta-analysis of trial data. It noted that meta-analysis would have allowed it to assess heterogeneity and uncertainty in the treatment effect. The committee concluded that it would have preferred to have seen the results of a meta-analysis, but accepted this would be unlikely to have any meaningful impact on the results presented.\n\n【18】 # Cost-effectiveness evidence\n\n【19】 ## The company's economic model is suifor decision making\n move to an 'include peanuts in diet' health state. From all health states, people could move to 'spontaneous tolerance' with the lifetime probability of 5%, or 'death' health states. The committee concluded that the model structure and health states were reasonable, and suifor decision making.\n\n【20】 ## It is reasonable to assume no survival benefit from Palforzia\nThe model assumed that peanut allergy does not increase the risk of death compared with that of the general population. The company modelled the risk of death from UK life s for the general population. The company assumed that Palforzia had no effect on the risk of dying. All gains in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were from improvements in quality of life for patients and their carers. The committee recalled that deaths from peanut allergy are very rare in the UK. However, the committee considered it possible that Palforzia could decrease that risk and noted that the assumption of no survival gain may be conservative  section 3.. The committee concluded that it is reasonable to assume no survival benefit of Palforzia in the model.\n\n【21】 ## The model does not reflect that in the NHS some people may need an oral food challenge before starting Palforzia\n noted that people with recent severe reactions to small amounts of peanut protein from accidental exposure would not need a food challenge. The committee acknowledged that the model did not include a food challenge before starting treatment with Palforzia. The committee concluded that the model does not reflect the likely need for oral food challenge before starting Palforzia in the NHS.\n\n【22】 ## The model does not reflect that most people would not need an oral food challenge after Palforzia treatment in NHS practice\n confirmed that if a food challenge were needed after Palforzia, they would offer one only after 1 to 2 years of treatment. They explained that fewer than 20% of people would need a food challenge to determine tolerance after treatment with Palforzia. This is because taking maintenance doses of Palforzia is a de facto food challenge, and if people take 300 mg Palforzia every day, they will be able to tolerate the same amount of peanut protein. Therefore, most people could start including peanuts in their diets without the oral food challenge. The committee concluded that the model does not reflect that most people would not need an oral food challenge after Palforzia treatment in NHS practice.\n\n【23】 ## Few people are likely to continue treatment with Palforzia lifelong in NHS practice, and the model overestimates this\nIn the model, people who tolerate at least 300 mg peanut protein in the oral food challenge after approximately 2 years of treatment can:\nstay on Palforzia lifelong and continue avoiding peanuts\nstart including peanuts in their diet permanently\nstart including peanuts in their diet, but then switch back to avoiding peanuts. The company estimated the likelihood of being in each of these 3 groups based on a consensus clinical opinion. The company considers these estimates confidential so they cannot be reported here. The ERG acknowledged that the company used reasonable methods to reach these estimates but highlighted that they are not evidence based and are uncertain. The patient experts explained that people who have committed to 2 years' treatment with Palforzia will be highly motivated to maintain tolerance, start dietary peanuts and adhere to a diet that includes peanuts. The clinical experts agreed that most people would be happy to start including peanuts in their diet, although some may then stop. The clinical experts explained that only people with borderline tolerance to 300 mg peanut protein may need to continue treatment with Palforzia. They expected this would be fewer than 5% of people who had completed maintenance treatment with Palforzia. The committee noted that this proportion was lower than the company assumed in its model. The committee concluded that fewer people than modelled are likely to continue treatment with Palforzia lifelong in NHS practice.\n\n【24】 # Utility values\n\n【25】 ## The utility values for people with peanut allergy are uncertain\nThe company conducted a de novo utility study to estimate quality of life in children and young people with peanut allergy using the EQ‑5D‑Y (the youth EQ‑5D), and for their carers using EQ‑5D. The company pooled data from various sources and populations to obtain utility estimates, including:\n-nline surveys completed by young people aged 12 to 17 with peanut allergy themselves ('self-reported utilities'); none of whom had prior treatment with Palforzia\n-nline surveys completed by carers on behalf of their children aged 4 to 11 with peanut allergy ('proxy-reported utilities'); none of the children had prior treatment with Palforzia\ninterviews with carers reporting utilities on behalf of their children aged 4 to 11 with peanut allergy; none of the children had prior treatment with Palforzia\n noted that the difference between the company and ERG approaches seemed to be driven mainly by differences in methods of data collection, rather than whether utilities were self- or proxy-reported. The committee agreed it was unclear which utility values better reflected quality of life of people with peanut allergy in NHS practice. The committee concluded that the utility values were uncertain and agreed to consider both the ERG-preferred approach and the pooled sample from all treatment-naive people, that is, excluding those from the Palforzia survey (n=.\n\n【26】 ## The model adequately reflects utility values for carers of children with peanut allergy\nThe patient and clinical experts explained that carers often 'carry the mental load' of peanut allergy day to day. The model included carer disutility until people with peanut allergy reached 18 years of age. The utility values for carers were collected in the company's de novo utility study, using EQ‑5D  section 3.. The company assumed that on average, there was more than 1 carer per child (the company considers the exact number to be confidential so it cannot be reported here). The ERG agreed it was reasonable to include carer quality of life in the model, but highlighted that the number of carers per child is uncertain. The committee noted that the number of carers per child assumed by the company was in line with other technology appraisals that included carers' quality of life. The committee concluded that including carers' quality of life in the model is appropriate, and that the methods used by the company to capture this were accep\n\n【27】 ## It is reasonable to assume the utility gains for children with peanut allergy and their carers can be realised without oral food challenge\n recalled that taking maintenance doses of Palforzia is a de facto food challenge and people could start including peanuts in their diet after reaching tolerance to 300 mg peanut protein. The committee concluded that utility gains for children with peanut allergy and their carers related to Palforzia treatment can be realised without an oral food challenge.\n\n【28】 # Costs\n\n【29】 ## The model should have included the costs related to setting up oral immunotherapy services in NHS food allergy clinics\nThe committee noted that treatment with Palforzia is resource intensive because patients must attend a clinic prepared to treat anaphylaxis for initial dose escalation and the first dose of each new up‑dosing level. The ERG confirmed that the company's model captures costs related to staff time and resources needed to deliver Palforzia during these clinic visits. The clinical experts explained that food allergy clinics are mainly run as diagnostic services; extending into delivering oral immunotherapy would demand additional investment, particularly in capacity and training of staff. The company confirmed that its model did not include costs related to the 'set up' needed to provide oral immunotherapy in food allergy clinics. The committee noted that NICE's guide to the methods of technology appraisal specifies that 'if introduction of the technology requires changes in infrastructure, costs or savings should be included in the analysis'. The committee concluded that the model should have included all costs related to setting up oral immunotherapy treatment in NHS practice.\n\n【30】 ## The costs of reactions to accidental peanut exposure and treatment-related adverse events are adequately captured in the model\nThe ERG's and company's final models included all treatment-related adverse events that could affect costs or benefits of Palforzia. Both assumed that an ambulance and accident and emergency visit may be needed for all anaphylactic reactions regardless of their severity or cause – that is, whether caused by Palforzia or accidental exposure to peanuts. The clinical experts agreed that all patients with anaphylaxis should receive the same care, regardless of cause. The committee concluded that the company and ERG captured the costs of reactions to accidental peanut exposure and treatment-related adverse events in their models.\n\n【31】 # Cost-effectiveness estimates\n\n【32】 ## Palforzia is a cost-effective use of NHS resources\nThe committee noted that company and ERG base-case models differed only in their approach to estimating utility values  section 3.. In a deterministic pairwise analysis, the company base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was £23,745 per QALY gained compared with avoiding peanuts only. The ERG deterministic base case was £36,565 per QALY gained. Corresponding probabilistic ICERs were £25,940 and £39,716 per QALY gained, respectively, compared with avoiding peanuts only. However, the committee noted that neither the ERG nor company base cases fully captured its preferences that:\nup to 50% of people may need an oral food challenge before starting Palforzia in NHS practice to confirm peanut allergy  section 3.\nfewer than 20% of people would need an oral food challenge after Palforzia treatment to determine if they can start introducing peanuts into the diet, instead of continuing Palforzia  section 3.\nfewer than 5% of people would be expected to continue treatment with Palforzia lifelong in NHS practice  section 3.\nutility values for people with peanut allergy are highly uncertain; therefore, both the ERG-preferred utilities from only adolescent self-reported, treatment-naive sample (n= and pooled utilities from all people naive to treatment (n= should be considered  section 3.\nPalforzia can have a positive impact on quality of life of people with peanut allergy and their carers without an oral food challenge  section 3.\n recalled that peanut allergy is a burden for children and their carers  section 3.. Therefore, the committee concluded that Palforzia is likely to be a cost-effective use of NHS resources, and therefore recommended it for routine NHS use.\n\n【33】 # Innovation and equality\n\n【34】 ## Palforzia is innovative and may have some benefits that are not adequately captured in the model\nThe committee agreed with the clinical experts and the company that Palforzia is a 'potential step change' in treating peanut allergy and as such is innovative. It further noted some potential benefits that may not have been captured in the modelling:\nThe company's model assumed no survival benefit from Palforzia  section 3., so if even 1 death from anaphylaxis is prevented by Palforzia, this would be an additional benefit for people with peanut allergy and the NHS.\nEven if people do not continue to benefit from treatment for their whole life, for example if they return to avoiding peanuts later in life, they may still have benefited from treatment and peanut tolerance during important years as a young adult, when they are growing up, gaining independence and travelling.The committee concluded that Palforzia is innovative and may have some benefits that were not adequately captured in the model, and took this into account in its decision making.\n\n【35】 ## There are no equalities issues that can be addressed in the guidance\nThe committee recalled that Palforzia has a marketing authorisation for treatment of peanut allergy in people aged 4 to 17 and those who turned 18 while on treatment  section 2.. This means most adults with peanut allergy will have no access to treatment. However, the committee noted that its remit only allows it to appraise a technology within its marketing authorisation.\nThe committee recalled that treatment with Palforzia is resource intensive because patients must attend a clinic prepared to treat anaphylaxis for initial dose escalation and the first dose of each new up‑dosing level, in line with its marketing authorisation  section 3.. The patient and clinical experts explained that there may be unequal access to specialist allergy clinics in England because of geographic location or socioeconomic status. The committee considered these issues but noted they are related to implementing guidance in NHS practice and therefore outside of its remit. The committee concluded there are no equalities issues that can be addressed in the guidance.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

After mating, the eggs are excreted in the feces.  The first intermediate host, the terrestrial snail (Cionella lubrica in the United States), eats the feces, and becomes infected by the larval parasites. The larvae (or cercariae) drill through the wall of the gut and settle in its digestive tract, where they develop into a juvenile stage. The snail tries to defend itself by walling the parasites off in cysts, which it then excretes and leaves behind in the grass. The second intermediate host, an ant (Formica fusca in the United States), uses the trail of slime as a source of moisture.  The ant then swallows a cyst loaded with hundreds of juvenile lancet flukes. The parasites enter the gut and then drift through its body, eventually moving to the sub-esophageal ganglion (a cluster of nerve cells underneath the esophagus). There, the flukes, now as metacercariae, take control of the ant's actions by manipulating these nerves. As evening approaches and the air cools, the infested ant is drawn away from other members of the colony and upward to the top of a blade of grass. Once there, it clamps its mandibles onto the top of the blade and stays there until dawn. Afterward, it goes back to its normal activity at the ant colony. If the host ant were to be subjected to the heat of the direct sun, it would die along with the parasite. Night after night, the ant goes back to the top of a blade of grass until a grazing animal comes along and eats the blade, upon which the lancet flukes will be back inside their host. They live out their adult lives inside the animal, reproduce, and the cycle continues.\n\n【3】 # Ecological role\nThe lancet flukes are important to grasslands. To prevent infestation, cattle avoid patches of the greenest grass, which has been fertilized by manure. The danger for them is not the feces themselves, but rather the possibility that tiny ants might be at the tops of the blades, carrying the parasite . Therefore, those patches grow undisturbed as cows feed on the remaining grass, which is not enough for all of them. The cows are then forced to eat the green grass, and for a while the cow population rises. Eventually, the parasites infect the cows. Infected cows eat less and fail to reproduce as frequently. The cow population drops, allowing the grass to regrow. The cow population eventually recovers and returns to being wary of the greenest grass, completing the cycle.\n\n【4】 # Treatment\n\n【5】 ## Antimicrobial Regimen\n- 1.Dicrocoelium dendriticum\n- Preferred regimen: Praziquantel 25 mg/kg PO tid for 2 days\n- Note: Praziquantel is not approved for treatment of children less than 4 years old.\n- Alternative regimen : Myrrh (commiphora molmol) 12 mg/kg/day PO for 6 days\n- Alternative regimen : Triclabendazole 10 mg/kg PO single dose", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Therefore, caution should be used when administering nitazoxanide concurrently with other highly plasma protein-bound drugs with narrow therapeutic indices, as competition for binding sites may occur (e.g., warfarin). In vitro metabolism studies have demonstrated that tizoxanide has no significant inhibitory effect on cytochrome P450 enzymes. Although no drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted in vivo, it is expected that no significant interaction would occur when nitazoxanide is co-administered with drugs that either are metabolized by or inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes.\nCarcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\nLong-term carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted.\nNitazoxanide was not genotoxic in the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell chromosomal aberration assay or the mouse micronucleus assay.

Other indications include hypochondriasis and body dysmorphic disorder.\nDespite the availability of newer agents, it remains extremely popular. Over 23.1 million prescriptions for generic formulations of fluoxetine were filled in the United States in 2006, making it the third most prescribed antidepressant.\n\n【2】 # History\nAccording to David Wong, the work which eventually led to the discovery of fluoxetine began at Eli Lilly in 1970 as a collaboration between Bryan Molloy and Robert Rathburn.\nIt was known at that time that antihistamine diphenhydramine shows some antidepressant-like properties.  3-Phenoxy-3-phenylpropylamine, a compound structurally similar to diphenhydramine, was taken as a starting point, and Molloy synthesized dozens of its derivatives. Testing the physiological effects of these compounds in mice resulted in nisoxetine, a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor currently widely used in biochemical experiments.\nLater, hoping to find a derivative inhibiting only serotonin reuptake, Wong proposed to re-test the series for the in-vitro reuptake of serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine. This test, carried out by Jong-Sir Horng in May 1972, showed the compound later named fluoxetine to be the most potent and selective inhibitor of serotonin reuptake of the series.\nA controversy ensued after Lilly researchers published a paper entitled \"Prozac (fluoxetine, Lilly , the first selective serotonin uptake inhibitor and an antidepressant drug\" implicitly claiming fluoxetine to be the first selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Two years later they had to issue a correction, admitting that the first SSRI was zimelidine developed by Arvid Carlsson and colleagues.  (However, unlike its successful cousin, zimelidine was banned worldwide because of serious side effects.) Fluoxetine was the third SSRI on the market. Fluvoxamine (Luvox) had been marketed in Europe since 1983.  Fluoxetine made its appearance on the Belgian market in 1986 and was approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States in December 1987.\nEli Lilly's patent on Prozac (fluoxetine) expired in August, 2001, prompting an influx of generic drugs onto the market.\n\n【3】 # Pharmacokinetics\nThe bioavailability of fluoxetine is relatively high (72%), and peak plasma concentrations are reached in 6 to 8 hours. It is highly bound to plasma proteins, mostly albumin.\nFluoxetine is metabolized in the liver by isoenzymes of the cytochrome P450 system, including CYP2D6. The role of CYP2D6 in the metabolism of fluoxetine may be clinically important, as there is great genetic variability in the function of this enzyme among people. Only one metabolite of fluoxetine, norfluoxetine (demethylated fluoxetine), is biologically active.\nFluoxetine is cleared slowly from the body; its elimination half-life ranges from 1 to 3 days—after a single dose—to 4 to 6 days (after long-term use) in healthy adults, and is prolonged in those with liver disease. The half-life of norfluoxetine is longer (16 days after long-term use). Complete excretion of the drug may take several weeks.\n\n【4】 # Dosing and administration\nStudies comparing fluoxetine 20, 40, and 60 mg/day to placebo indicate that 20 mg/day is sufficient to obtain a satisfactory response in major depressive disorder in most cases. Consequently, a dose of 20 mg/day, administered in the morning, is recommended as the initial dose.\nAt least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of an MAOI and initiation of therapy with fluoxetine. In addition, at least 5 weeks, perhaps longer, should be allowed after stopping Prozac before starting an MAOI.\nFluoxetine comes in 10, 20, 40 and 60 mg capsules. Prozac Weekly comes in 90 mg capsules.\nIt may take 4 to 5 weeks or longer before the patient feels the full benefit of fluoxetine for most indications and even longer - up to 3 months (and perhaps in high doses - 60 mg or more), for obsessive compulsive disorder.\n\n【5】 # Side effects\nFluoxetine is generally well tolerated. The most common side effects for patients taking Fluoxetine are as follows:\n- Akathisia\n- Anxiety\n- Asthenia\n- Headache\n- Flu syndrome\n- Fever\n- Vasodilation\n- Nausea\n- Diarrhea\n- Dry mouth\n- Dyspepsia\n- Insomnia\n- Nervousness\n- Somnolence\n- Dizziness\n- Tremor\n- Sweating\n- Dilated pupils\n- Heartburn\n- Seizures\n- Hives\n- Rash\nAnxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, hypomania, and mania, have been reported in adult and pediatric patients being treated with Prozac for major depressive disorder as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and non-psychiatric. If these symptoms occur the medication should be reduced or cautiously withdrawn.\nSince the introduction of fluoxetine, systemic events, possibly related to vasculitis and including lupus-like syndrome, have developed in patients with rash. Although these events are rare, they may be serious, involving the lung, kidney, or liver. Death has been reported to occur in association with these systemic events.\nThe simultaneous use of fluoxetine with triptans, tramadol or other serotonergic agents can result in a rare, but potentially life-threatening adverse drug reaction called Serotonin syndrome.\nSSRIs such as fluoxetine have been associated with tardive dyskinesia and akathisia, among other extrapyramidal symptoms more commonly associated with antipsychotics.\n\n【6】 ## Reproductive and developmental toxicity\nOther side effects may occur, including sexual dysfunction. Possible sexual side effects can include anorgasmia, reduced libido and impotence.\nA U.S. NTP-CERHR expert panel concluded that the SSRI fluoxetine (Prozac) produces reproductive toxicity by causing reversible impaired sexual function and exhibits developmental toxicity characterized by an increased rate of poor neonatal adaptation.\nBecause fluoxetine is excreted in human milk, nursing while on fluoxetine is not recommended. The AAP classifies fluoxetine as a drug for which the effect on the nursing infant is unknown but may be of concern.\n\n【7】 # Discontinuation of treatment\nDuring marketing of fluoxetine and other SSRIs and SNRIs (serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors), there have been spontaneous reports of adverse events occurring upon discontinuation of these drugs, particularly when abrupt, including the following: dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances (e.g., paresthesias such as electric shock sensations), anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, and hypomania. While these events are generally self-limiting, there have been reports of serious discontinuation symptoms. Patients should be monitored for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment with fluoxetine.\n\n【8】 # Suicide Rate\n reinforced the fact that antidepressant drugs reduce suicide risk. Psychiatrists found that the increase is due to the decline in prescriptions of antidepressant drugs like Prozac to young people since 2003, leaving more cases of serious depression untreated. In a December 2006 study, The American Journal of Psychiatry said that a decrease in antidepressant prescriptions to minors of just a few percentage points coincided with a 14 percent increase in suicides in the United States; in the Netherlands, the suicide rate was 50% up, upon prescription drop.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

This causes precisely the opposite of the desired effect when purchasing an air purifier.\n\n【4】 # Ions vs ozone\nIonisers should not be confused with ozone generators, even though both devices operate in a similar way. Ionisers use an electrostatically charged plate to produce positively or negatively charged gas ions that particulate matter sticks to (in an effect similar to static electricity). Ozone generators are optimised to attract an extra oxygen ion to an O2 molecule, using either a corona discharge tube or UV light.\nEven the best ionisers will produce a small amount of ozone, and ozone generators will produce gaseous ions of molecules other than ozone (unless fed by pure oxygen, not air).\nOzone is claimed by some alternative medicine proponents Template:Weasel-inline to be relatively harmless to humans, but this is a demonstrable fallacy.

However, the needed concentrations are toxic enough to man and animal that the FDA explicitly demands ozone therapy not be used as medical treatment,\nand has taken action against businesses that fail to comply with this regulation.\n\n【5】 # Consumer Reports court case\nConsumer Reports, a non-profit U.S.-based product-testing magazine, reported in October 2003 that air ionizers do not perform to high enough standards compared to conventional HEPA air filters.  In response to this report, The Sharper Image, a manufacturer of air ionizers (among other things), sued Consumer's Union (the publishers of Consumer Reports) for product defamation.  The Sharper Image's Ionic Breeze unit did meEPA guidelines, including less than 50 ppb ozone production. Consumer Reports gave the Ionic Breeze and other popular units a \"fail\" because they have a low Clean Air Delivery Rate (CADR).  CADR measures the amount of filtered air circulated during a short period of time, and was originally designed to rate media-based air cleaners.  The Sharper Image claimed that this test was a poor way to rate the Ionic Breeze, since it does not take into account other features, such as 24-hour a day continuous cleaning, ease of maintenance, and silent operation.  The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California subsequently struck The Sharper Image's complaint and dismissed the case, reasoning that The Sharper Image had failed to demonstrate that it could prove any of the statements made by Consumer Reports were false.  The Court's final ruling in May 2005 ordered The Sharper Image to pay $525,000 USD for Consumer Union's legal expenses.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

{"seq_id": "bae02b6c-a9f7-472d-8084-2624bcbbcb82", "title": null, "text": "【0】 This guideline provides recommendations for the screening, diagnosis, and follow-up care of human papillomavirus (HPV) related cancers, including cervical, vaginal, and vulvar, in females aged ≥ 9 years (due to the HPV immunization recommendations). This guideline is part of the  -Genital Tract Cancers in Females series. The series includes two other guidelines: Endometrial Cancer and Ovarian, Fallopian Tube and Primary Peritoneal Cancers. Signs and symptoms for the different female genital tract cancers may overlap (e.g., abnormal uterine bleeding); and therefore these guidelines may need to be used in conjunction with each other when performing initial diagnostic investigations.- HPV immunization is recommended for the prevention of HPV infection, which is the major risk factor for cervical, vaginal and vulvar cancers. 1 - Screening for cervical cancer in asymptomatic females should be offered as per the BC Cancer Agency's (BCCA) Cervical Cancer Screening Program which were update June 2016. 2 - If cancer of the cervix is clinically suspected, then proceed to biopsy or colposcopy -even in the case of a normal Papanicolaou smear test (Pap test) result.The major risk factor for cervical, vaginal, and vulvar cancers is HPV infection. 1, 2 Additional risk factors include sexual activity at a young age, multiple sexual partners or a partner who has had multiple sexual partners, history of other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and smoking. 1 -4    Prevention of cervical, vaginal and vulvar cancers revolves around preventing HPV infection through HPV immunization and avoiding skin-to-skin sexual contact with another person through safe sexual behaviours (e.g., condom use 5,6. Sexual contact may be defined as intercourse, digital or oral sexual contact involving the genital area.According to National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI; February :  HPV vaccine (Cervarix or Gardasil) is recommended for females between 9 and 26 years of age.  HPV vaccine (Cervarix or Gardasil) may be administered to females > 26 years of age.# HPV Vaccines\nFor females aged 9 to 45 years without prior HPV exposure, both the quadrivalent (Gardasil) and bivalent (Cervarix) vaccines have been shown to have a positive effect for the prevention of HPV-related infection and precancerous cervical disease. However, the overall effectiveness of preventing against cervical cancer has not been demonstrated.\nAs the HPV vaccines do not protect against all cancers of the cervix, nor do they eliminate pre-existing infection, females should continue cervical cancer screening as per BCCA guidelines. For males, Gardasil is the only vaccine approved for use in males aged between 9 and 26 years, but at this time there is no publicly funded HPV vaccine program in BC for males.\nThe two types of HPV vaccines are:\n- Quadrivalent HPV vaccine (Gardasil) 7,8 -protects against HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18\n- Indications for females aged between 9 and 45 for the prevention of: i. cervical, vulvar and vaginal cancer (caused by HPV types 16 and ; ii. genital warts (condyloma acuminata; caused by HPV types 6 and ; and iii. precancerous or dysplastic lesions (caused by HPV types 6, 11, 16 and . - Indications for females aged between 9 and 26 for the prevention of: i. anal cancer (caused by HPV types 16 and ; and ii. precursor lesions (caused by HPV types 6, 11, 16 and . - Offered free for BC females born in 1994 or later, available through a school-based program (starting in grade , physician, pharmacist, or local health unit. 9 - Also available for those not eligible for free HPV vaccine through patient-pay (approximately $500 for the 3 doses).\n- Bivalent HPV vaccine (Cervarix) 7,10,11 -protects against HPV types 16 and 18\n- Indications for females aged between 9 and 45 for the prevention of: i. cervical cancer (caused by HPV types 16 and ; and ii. precancerous or dysplastic lesions (caused by HPV types 16 and . - Offered free for BC females aged ≤ 26 years and born before 1994, available through physician, pharmacist, sexual health clinic, youth clinics and student health centre. This is a time-limited program that is available while supplies are available, until the vaccine has expired. - Also available for those not eligible for free HPV vaccine through patient-pay (approximately $300 for the 3 doses).\n\n【1】 # Age at time of\n\n【2】 # Cervical Cancer\n known as cervical cytology) is currently the only test used for the cervical cancer screening program for asymptomatic females. Refer to B: Pap Sampling Technique.\nOther tests include liquid-based cytology (LBC) (which is currently unavailable in BC) and high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) molecular testing (which is available in BC by patient pay).\nSymptomatic women should be treated appropriately. If cancer of the cervix is clinically suspected, then refer to BCCA's Division of Gynecologic Oncology, even if there are negative screening results.\n\n【3】 # Age to Start Screening for Average Risk (as of June 2016 2\nIt is currently recommended that screening for cervical cancer should begin at age 25, including those who have received the HPV vaccine, in same sex relationship, or transgender with a cervix. Screening is not recommended for those aged 25 -69 who have never had sexual contact (i.e., intercourse, digital sexual contact, oral sexual contact) or patients after total hysterectomy (i.e., removal of cervix) but with no history of pre-cancerous lesions or cervical cancer.\n\n【4】 # Controversies in Care 12\nThere are different recommendations on when to initiate screening for cervical cancer. These include starting at age 21, 25, or 30, or when a female becomes sexually active regardless of age. The Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care (CTFPHC) 13 recommends routine screening should start at the age of 25 for those who are or have been sexually active. The age 25 is suggested because  invasive cervical cancers in females < 25 are rare;  screening methods are less effective in younger females;  the majority of oncogenic HPV infections as well as precursor lesions tend to resolve spontaneously in younger females; and  harms associated with screening and treating younger females (e.g., treatment of precursor lesions may be associated with an increased risk of preterm births).\n\n【5】 # Screening Intervals for Average Risk (as of June  2\nRepeat Pap tests every 3 years. An optimal screening interval will minimize the detection of transient cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) lesions, without exposing females to an unacceptably high risk of invasive cervical carcinoma.\nScreening Intervals for Higher Risk (as of June  2 - Immunocompromised individuals (includes those with human immunodeficiency virus lymphoproliferative disorders, organ transplants, and those under long-term immunosuppression therapy: Annual screening. There is a lack of evidence for or against screening in older age groups. In BC, the current recommendation is that females should discontinue cervical cancer screening at age 69, provided that they have had at least three negative screening test results in the past 10 years and have not been previously treated for CIN or invasive cancer.\n\n【6】 # Age to Stop Screening for Higher Risk 2\n\n【7】 # Category Screening Recommendations\n\n【8】 # Immunocompromised individuals\nThe benefits of screening beyond age 69 must be weighed in the context of the overall health of the patient.\nHistory of pre-cancerous lesions or cervical cancer Age 69 or 25 years since diagnosis with at least 5 negative Pap test with no significantly abnormality in last 10 years whichever occurs later. Hysterectomy with the cervix removed and a history of pre-cancerous lesions or cervical cancer High risk behaviours N/A\n\n【9】 # Vaginal and Vulvar Cancer\nThese areas should be examined during a gynecological examination for lesions or skin changes.\n\n【10】 # Cervical Cancer\nRecommendations for further investigations (e.g., colposcopy) or repeat testing will be provided on the cytology report for any abnormal Pap tests.\nIn the event of a clinical lesion, or if cancer of the cervix is clinically suspected, a Pap test is not an appropriate diagnostic procedure. Even in the case of a reassuring Pap test, if cancer of the cervix is clinically suspected, then arrange either a biopsy or colposcopy.\nIf invasive cervical cancer is diagnosed, then refer the patient to BCCA for assessment and management planning by a multidisciplinary team.  The benchmark for an appointment at BCCA is 2 weeks following referral; urgent cases may be seen sooner upon telephone consultation.\n\n【11】 # Vaginal and Vulvar Cancer\nDiagnosis is made by vulvo-vaginal visualization, palpation and biopsy. Biopsy any suspicious lesions or refer to BCCA. Note that speculum blades may obscure full visualization of vaginal tissue.\nOnce diagnosed, refer the patient to BCCA for assessment and management planning by a multidisciplinary team.  ‡ The benchmark for an appointment at the BCCA is 2 weeks following referral; urgent cases may be seen sooner upon telephone consultation.\nTreatment for cervical, vaginal and vulvar cancers will be directed by the BCCA team.\n\n【12】 # Cervical Cancer\nManagement will be surgical if the lesion is small with no extra-cervical disease, and with a low risk of lymph node metastasis. Radiation with concurrent chemotherapy is standard management for larger lesions.\nFertility-sparing surgery may be an option in some circumstances.\n\n【13】 # Vaginal Cancer\nLower vaginal cancers (i.e., lower 1/ will mostly be treated with surgery. Radiation and concurrent chemotherapy may be advised in selected cases.\nUpper vaginal cancers (i.e., upper 2/ will mostly be treated with radiation and concurrent chemotherapy. Surgery may be appropriate in selected cases.\n\n【14】 # Vulvar Cancer\nThe specific surgical procedure may vary from a wide local excision to a radical approach. Surgery will be individualized, to preserve vital but uninvolved structures (such as sphincters and the clitoris), and to avoid radical groin resection. Sentinel node assessment is now the standard approach for lesions smaller than 2 cm.\nNeoadjuvant radiotherapy (which is therapy given before surgery) may be used to downstage cancers that involve vital structures. When cancer involves vital structures such as the anus, uretha or clitoris, pre-surgical radiation may reduce the tumour size with the hope that these structures may be preserved at the time of surgery.\nAdjuvant radiotherapy (which is therapy given after surgery) may be recommended after resection of involved inguinal nodes, or when surgical margins are close.\nOnce the patient has completed treatment, she will be discharged from the BCCA. Upon discharge, the family physician may be asked to manage the patient's follow-up care.\nFollow-up care includes:  surveillance for recurrence or new cancer;\n monitoring and treating complications and/or side effects from treatment; and  providing patient support.\nSpecific recommendations will be provided in the patient's discharge letter. At any time, the patient and/or family physician may consult with the BCCA regarding any follow-up questions or concerns. If recurrent disease is suspected, then re-refer patient back to the BCCA.\nBelow are general recommendations for a patient's follow-up visits with her family physician, based on the type of cancer and/or type of therapy.\n\n【15】 # Cervical Cancer 14\nThe timing of the follow-up visits are:\n- Year 1 = Every month for the first 3 months, then every 2 months - Year 2 = Every 4 months - Years 3, 4 & 5 = Every 6 months - Years 5+ = Annually A follow-up visit consists of:  review of any symptoms (e.g., pain, discharge, vaginal bleeding, menopause, swelling of leg or vulva, new neurological lower limb symptoms, issues with sexual, urinary and/or bowel functions);  physical exam, including lymph node surveillance (supraclavicular, inguinal and femoral nodes), abdomen, speculum and pelvic exam;  cervical or vaginal vault screening as per screening guidelines; and  any patient support required (e.g., counselling about sexual health -maintenance of vaginal patency post radiotherapy, through regular vaginal intercourse or the use of a dilator).\n\n【16】 # Vaginal Cancer 15\nThe timing of the follow-up visits are:", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}
