However, the International Registry of Acute Aortic Dissection database, a multicentre registry that includes more than 4000 cases, states that a known aortic aneurysm, either thoracic or abdominal, is associated with AAS. 24 Therefore, we updated the definition of aortic aneurysm in our assessment of pretest probability to include both abdominal and thoracic aneurysms as risk factors.
Patients may not be aware of the presence of an aortic aneurysm. Bedside ultrasound has been found to be accurate in the diagnosis of abdominal aortic aneurysms. 25 A multicentre prospective observational study including 839 patients (very lowquality evidence, downgraded for risk of bias and indirectness) showed moderate diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity 0.60, 95% confidence interval  0.51-0.68; specificity 0.85, 95% CI 0.83-0.88) for assessment of aneurysmal dilation of the aortic root. 26 Bedside ultrasound is operator dependent; therefore, the diagnostic accuracy may vary depending on the level of training. 
 1,2 Canadian and international data from large studies spanning multiple jurisdictions demonstrate that approximately 7-11% of pregnant women will require hospitalization for COVID-related morbidity and between 1-4% of pregnant women require admission to an intensive care unit (ICU). 1,2,3 Recently, a prospective cohort study of 5183 pregnant women compared to 175 905 non-pregnant women demonstrated that pregnancy conferred an increased risk of death from COVID-19 ( 1.84,).
