Each 100‑microlitre vial contains 4 mg of aflibercept. Aflibercept solution for injection must only be administered by a qualified doctor experienced in administering intravitreal injections. The summary of product characteristics also states that there is no need for monitoring between injections. After the first 12 months of treatment, the treatment interval may be extended based on visual and anatomic outcomes. In this case the schedule for monitoring should be determined by the treating doctor.\nThe summary of product characteristics lists the following most common adverse reactions for aflibercept solution for injection: conjunctival haemorrhage, eye pain, vitreous detachment, cataract, vitreous floaters and increased intraocular pressure\n\n【5】 #Clinical effectiveness\n\n【6】 For both studies, the manufacturer defined 3 populations for analysis. The full analysis set included all randomised patients who received any study drug and had a baseline and at least 1 post‑baseline assessment. The per protocol set included all patients in the full analysis set who received at least 9 injections of study drug or sham and attended at least 9 scheduled visits during the first 52 weeks, except for those who were excluded because of major protocol violations. The safety analysis set included all patients who received any study drug. The manufacturer stated that the per protocol set was used for primary analysis (statistical evaluation of non‑inferiority). A patient who withdrew from the study before week 36 because of treatment failure was considered a 'non‑responder'. The last observation carried forward approach was used to calculate missing data except for baseline values. Patients withdrawing before week 36 were not included in the primary analysis but were included in the secondary analysis (in the full analysis set).\nThe baseline demographics and disease characteristics were similar between the aflibercept 2 mg every 8 weeks and ranibizumab treatment arms in the VIEW 1 and 2 studies. In VIEW 1, the mean age was 78 years, 41% of patients were male, and 97% of patients were white. In VIEW 2, the mean age was 73–75 years, 45% of patients were male, and 73% of patients were white. The total mean baseline best‑corrected visual acuity score (defined by Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study  scale) ranged from 54 to 56 letters in VIEW 1 and from 52 to 54 letters in VIEW 2. In both studies, the distribution of occult, minimally classic and predominantly classic lesion types in the study eye was similar across both treatment arms.\nThe primary outcome of VIEW 1 and 2 was the proportion of patients who maintained vision at week 52, defined as losing fewer than 15 letters on the ETDRS scale compared with baseline. This outcome was also measured at week 96. In a pooled analysis of both studies, the proportion of patients treated with aflibercept who maintained vision at week 52 was 95.3% compared with 94.4% of patients treated with ranibizumab (difference −0.9%, 95% confidence interval  −3.5 to 1.7). At week 96, the proportion of patients treated with aflibercept who maintained vision was 92.4% compared with 91.6% of patients treated with ranibizumab (difference −0.8%, 95% CI −3.8 to 2.3). The manufacturer stated that aflibercept showed non‑inferiority to ranibizumab at weeks 52 and 96 because the upper limits of the confidence intervals for the differences in proportions were consistently below the pre‑specified boundary of 10%. The manufacturer also evaluated the primary outcome for pre‑planned subgroup analyses in both studies by age, sex, race, renal function, hepatic impairment, baseline visual acuity, lesion size and type. The manufacturer stated that the results for all subgroups in both studies and in pooled analyses were consistent with the results in the whole study populations. However, the results of these subgroup analyses were not presented by the manufacturer.\nSecondary outcomes in VIEW 1 and 2 included changes from baseline to week 52 for: best‑corrected visual acuity as measured by ETDRS letter score, proportion of patients gaining at least 15 letters, and choroidal neovascularisation area. For the outcome of best‑corrected visual acuity at week 52, mean ETDRS letter scores increased by approximately 7−11 letters in both treatment arms in VIEW 1 and by approximately 8–10 letters in VIEW 2. No statistically significant differences in change in best‑corrected visual acuity from baseline to week 52 were reported between aflibercept and ranibizumab in a pooled analysis of both studies (mean difference −0.32 letters, 95% CI −1.87 to 1.23). In VIEW 1 and 2, improvements in visual acuity observed at week 52 were largely maintained at week 96 in both treatment arms. No statistically significant differences in the proportion of patients who gained at least 15 ETDRS letters were reported between aflibercept and ranibizumab treatment arms at week 52 in a pooled analysis of both studies (30.97% and 32.44% respectively, p‑value not reported). Similar results were reported at week 96. In VIEW 1, the ranibizumab arm had a statistically significantly greater mean reduction in choroidal neovascularisation area at week 52 than the aflibercept arm (−4.2 mm2 and −3.4 mm2 respectively, p=0.017). No statistically significant differences in choroidal neovascularisation area at week 52 were reported between ranibizumab and aflibercept 2 mg every 8 weeks in VIEW 2 (−4.16 mm2 and −5.16 mm2 respectively, p=0.073). Similar results were also reported at week 96 in both studies.\nVision‑related quality of life was measured in VIEW 1 and 2 using the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire‑25 (NEI VFQ‑25), which includes 25 questions designed to measure the effect of visual impairment on daily functioning and quality of life. Improvements in the mean NEI VFQ‑25 total score from baseline to week 52 were similar in both the aflibercept and the ranibizumab treatment arms in a pooled analysis of both studies (5.0 points and 5.6 points respectively, p‑value not reported). These improvements in vision‑related quality of life were maintained at week 96 in both treatment arms. The VIEW 2 study also measured changes in health‑related quality of life using the EQ‑5D questionnaire, which were incorporated in the manufacturer's cost‑effectiveness analysis.\n\n【7】 #Cost effectiveness\nThe economic evidence provided by the manufacturer included a literature review, which identified one published cost‑effectiveness analysis of aflibercept in US patients with wet age‑related macular degeneration, and a de novo cost–utility analysis. The manufacturer developed a Markov state‑transition cohort model simulating cohorts of people with wet age‑related macular degeneration receiving aflibercept 2 mg every 8 weeks or ranibizumab 0.5 mg treatment as needed. The model assumed a cycle length of 1 month based on the level of monitoring associated with ranibizumab treatment, and used a lifetime horizon (25 years based on a starting age of 74 years). An NHS and personal social services perspective was taken and costs and benefits were discounted at 3.5%.\nThe economic model included a 5‑year treatment period on the basis of clinical opinion which suggested that patients are likely to continue treatment beyond 24 months. For the first 2 years, clinical-effectiveness data at baseline, 52 and 96 weeks from the last observation carried forward population in the VIEW 2 study were used to estimate the visual acuity of people receiving aflibercept. The probabilities of gaining and losing visual acuity in year 1 were applied to the VIEW 2 patient distribution at baseline and the probabilities of gaining and losing visual acuity in year 2 were applied to the modelled year 1 distribution. The visual acuity of people receiving ranibizumab for the first 2 years of the model was estimated from the relative risks of improving and maintaining vision for aflibercept compared with ranibizumab taken from the manufacturer's network meta‑analysis and indirect comparison of aflibercept 2 mg every 8 weeks with ranibizumab 0.5 mg treatment as needed. During this period, people who were defined as being in the blind health state received treatment with ranibizumab or aflibercept. However, this did not continue in years 3 to 5 on the basis of clinical opinion which suggested that the blind eye is unlikely to benefit from treatment. Simple linear interpolation was used to populate the monthly model cycles for year 1 (cycles 1–12) and year 2 (cycles 13–24). The annual rates of treatment discontinuation in year 1 (2.7%) and year 2 (3.5%) were assumed to be identical between both treatment groups and were based on an average of the discontinuation rates reported in the VIEW 2 and CATT studies.\nFor years 3 to 5 in the model, it was assumed that people on active treatment would remain in the same health state that they were in after 2 years. Because no statistically significant differences in clinical effectiveness were identified in the indirect comparison of aflibercept with ranibizumab, identical assumptions were made for both treatment groups during this period. In the absence of available trial data, clinical opinion was used to estimate the annual probability of treatment discontinuation in years 3 to 5 (18.7%), which were also assumed to be identical between treatment groups. From year 6 it was assumed that all people in both treatment groups discontinued active treatment and started best supportive care.\nTo estimate the health‑related quality of life associated with each health state corresponding to visual acuity in both eyes, EQ‑5D data from VIEW 2 were transformed to utility values using the UK population tariff. A pooled dataset of all trial arms at baseline, 52 weeks and 96 weeks was used by the manufacturer. The manufacturer adjusted the utility values for 4 of the health states in the model to maintain the assumption that utility values decrease consistently with worsening visual acuity. This was achieved by taking the average of the utility values above and below the anomalous value. Utility values were not adjusted for age in the model. The resulting utility values applied in the model are academic in confidence and therefore not reported here. The manufacturer stated that, because of the low rates of adverse events observed in the VIEW 1 and 2 trials and the small differences observed between the aflibercept and ranibizumab treatment groups, the impact of adverse events on health‑related quality of life was not included in the base‑case analysis. However, in a scenario analysis, the manufacturer included the loss in utility associated with adverse ocular events taken from 2 separate studies identified in a systematic literature review . These utility decrements were subtracted from the utility values for the health states defined by visual acuity and included retinal haemorrhage (−0.300), vitreous haemorrhage (−0.305), endophthalmitis (−0.300), cataract (−0.142) and retinal detachment (−0.27).\nThe manufacturer's base‑case deterministic cost‑effectiveness results (including the patient access scheme for aflibercept but not for ranibizumab) showed that aflibercept dominated ranibizumab because it resulted in lower costs and higher quality‑adjusted life years (QALYs; 7.77 compared with 7.76). When the manufacturer applied a discount to the list price of ranibizumab, ranging from 10 to 50%, aflibercept continued to dominate ranibizumab.\n\n【8】 #ERG critique of manufacturer's submission\nThe ERG considered that the clinical‑effectiveness evidence from the VIEW 1 and 2 studies was of good quality without any obvious sources of bias. The ERG noted that the manufacturer used the last observation carried forward approach to calculate missing data for the primary outcome of the proportion of people who maintained vision at week 52 in VIEW 1 and 2. The ERG considered that this approach may have introduced bias because it can artificially stabilise disease, which may be inappropriate for a progressive disease such as wet age‑related macular degeneration. After clarification, the manufacturer provided the observed results at week 52 for the outcome of maintained vision from the per protocol and full analysis datasets, which were similar to the original results based on the last observation carried forward approach. The ERG also ran the network meta‑analysis for the outcome of maintained vision at 12 months using observed data from VIEW 1 and 2 and found that the results were similar to the original results obtained using the last observation carried forward approach. Therefore, the ERG was satisfied that the use of last observation carried forward did not substantially impact the results for the primary outcome at week 52 in VIEW 1 and\nIn its critique of the manufacturer's economic model, the ERG noted that clinical‑effectiveness data for the aflibercept treatment group were derived from the VIEW 2 study rather than pooled data from VIEW 1 and 2. The ERG also noted that the proportion of people treated with aflibercept who gained or lost visual acuity at 52 weeks and 96 weeks was broadly similar between VIEW 1 and 2 and that there was no suggestion of bias arising from the choice of VIEW 2 data rather than pooled clinical‑effectiveness data. However, the ERG highlighted that there were discrepancies between the clinical‑effectiveness data from VIEW 2 and the modelled population in terms of the proportion of people who gained or maintained visual acuity at week 52. The ERG commented that it was unclear what clinical‑effectiveness data were used for the aflibercept group in the model.\nBecause the ERG concluded that the manufacturer's model may be limited to being a one‑eye model, it suggested that further consideration should be given as to whether people received treatment in their better‑seeing eye or their worse‑seeing eye and the resulting impact on health‑related quality of life. The ERG considered that the manufacturer's assumption of no second‑eye involvement in years 1 and 2 resulted in the model being a worse‑seeing eye model, with the additional assumption of the second eye having no visual impairment. On the basis of the manufacturer's EQ‑5D utility values from VIEW 2, the ERG suggested a narrower range of utility values for the 5 health states defined by visual acuity in a worse‑seeing eye model. For a better‑seeing eye model, the ERG suggested that utility values should be taken from a study by Brown  that measured vision‑related utility values using the time trade‑off method in 325 people from the USA with impaired vision (Snellen scale 20/40) in at least 1 eye. The ERG noted from the Brown study that, among people who had good vision in their better‑seeing eye, the worse‑seeing eye contributed little to health‑related quality of life. The utility values taken from the Brown study ranged from 0.920 to 0.621 for the 5 health states defined by visual acuity in the manufacturer's model, a range that the ERG noted was similar to the range of utility values from the VIEW 1 study under the assumption of the worse‑seeing eye being blind.\nThe ERG conducted exploratory analyses, which involved the following modifications to the manufacturer's model:\nsecond‑eye involvement after year 1 and 2 was set to zero to reflect the ERG's view that the submitted modelling of second‑eye involvement is untenable injections in year 1 were assumed for both treatment groups treatment visit costs were reduced to £129.46 and optical coherence tomography costs to £\n% of people in both treatment groups were monitored according to the one‑stop model in year\nutility values for a better‑seeing eye model  were drawn from the Brown study, ranging from 0.920 to 0.621; utility values for a worse‑seeing eye model were consistent with those used in the manufacturer's submission.\n\n【9】 Net monetary benefit=(£20,000×incremental QALYs)–incremental cost\n\n【10】 #Consideration of the evidence\nThe Appraisal Committee reviewed the data available on the clinical and cost effectiveness of aflibercept solution for injection, having considered evidence on the nature of wet age‑related macular degeneration and the value placed on the benefits of aflibercept by people with the condition, those who represent them, and clinical specialists. It also took into account the effective use of NHS resources.\nThe Committee heard from the patient experts that visual impairment has a substantial negative impact on the physical and emotional wellbeing of people with wet age‑related macular degeneration. The patient experts stated that the condition affects their ability to work and other leisure activities and in turn, can increase the risk of depression and social isolation. The patient experts also acknowledged that, despite any initial anxiety about having an injection in the eye, they are willing to receive injections in order to prevent sight loss. The Committee agreed that loss of vision caused by wet age‑related macular degeneration can substantially impair health‑related quality of life.\n\n【11】 #Clinical effectiveness\nThe Committee considered the evidence presented by the manufacturer on the clinical effectiveness of aflibercept. The Committee noted that the main  came from the VIEW 1 and 2 trials which compared aflibercept (2 mg every 8 weeks) with ranibizumab (0.5 mg every 4 weeks) in people with wet age‑related macular degeneration and that both studies were considered to be of high quality by the Evidence Review Group (ERG). It also noted that aflibercept at its licensed dose was shown to be clinically non‑inferior to ranibizumab in terms of visual acuity outcomes at 96 weeks. The Committee concluded that aflibercept is a clinically effective treatment option for visual impairment caused by wet age‑related macular degeneration.\n\n【12】 #Cost effectiveness\nThe Committee considered the manufacturer's economic model and the ERG's critique and exploratory analyses. The Committee noted that the model structure accounted for different levels of visual acuity in both eyes rather than the first eye to come to clinical attention. The Committee also noted the ERG's concerns about the manufacturer's approach to modelling second‑eye involvement. The Committee agreed with the ERG that it was unrealistic to assume no second‑eye involvement in the first 2 years of the model because a large proportion of patients in the VIEW 1 and 2 trials had visual impairment in their second eye at the start of treatment. It also agreed that the manufacturer did not give appropriate consideration to the timing of second‑eye involvement because the effect of treatment on visual acuity in the second eye and any associated costs were limited to years 3 to 5 in the model. The Committee concluded that the ERG's exploratory approach, which involved separate analyses depending on whether the study eye was a better‑seeing eye or worse‑seeing eye, was more reasonable.\n\n【13】 The Committee discussed how innovative aflibercept is in its potential to make a significant and substantial impact on health‑related benefits. It agreed that anti‑VEGF treatments were a substantial improvement over previous treatments, but considered that this improvement applied to the class of drugs, including bevacizumab. It stated that the innovation was in the development of anti‑VEGF treatments, not the act of licensing. In addition the Committee was not aware of any substantial benefits of aflibercept compared with ranibizumab that had not already been captured in the manufacturer's economic model.\nThe Committee considered whether there were any equalities considerations affecting population groups protected by equality legislation and concluded that there were no equality issues relating to this appraisal in the guidance.\n\n【14】 #Summary of Appraisal Committee's key conclusions\nTA2\nAppraisal title: Aflibercept solution for injection for treating wet age‑related macular degeneration\n\n【15】 Key conclusion\nAflibercept solution for injection is recommended as an option for treating wet age‑related macular degeneration only if it is used in accordance with the recommendations for ranibizumab in NICE technology appraisal guidance 155 (re‑issued in May 2012) and the manufacturer provides aflibercept solution for injection with the discount agreed in the patient access scheme.\n\n【16】 Current practice\nClinical need of patients, including the availability of alternative treatments\nThe Committee agreed that loss of vision caused by wet age‑related macular degeneration can substantially impair health‑related quality of life.\nThe technology\nProposed benefits of the technology\nHow innovative is the technology in its potential to make a significant and substantial impact on health‑related benefits?\nThe Committee understood from the clinical specialists that an important advantage of aflibercept is that it needs less frequent administration than ranibizumab while achieving similar clinical outcomes, as seen in the clinical trials, thus imposing less burden on NHS capacity.\nWhat is the position of the treatment in the pathway of care for the condition?\nAflibercept solution for injection has a UK marketing authorisation 'for adults for the treatment of neovascular (wet) age‑related macular degeneration (AMD)'.\nAdverse reactions\nEvidence for clinical effectiveness\nAvailability, nature and quality of evidence\nThe Committee noted that the main  came from the VIEW 1 and 2 trials which compared aflibercept (2 mg every 8 weeks) with ranibizumab (0.5 mg every 4 weeks) in people with wet age‑related macular degeneration and that both studies were considered to be of high quality by the Evidence Review Group (ERG).\nFor the comparison of aflibercept at its licensed dose with ranibizumab in a 'treatment as needed' regimen at 12 and 24 months, the Committee accepted the concerns highlighted by the manufacturer and the ERG about the validity of the manufacturer's network meta‑analyses and indirect comparisons because of the heterogeneity of the included studies. The Committee concluded that, in the absence of stronger evidence, the results could be used to inform decisions about the clinical effectiveness of aflibercept compared with ranibizumab in a 'treatment as needed' regimen.\nRelevance to general clinical practice in the NHS\nUncertainties generated by the evidence\nAre there any clinically relevant subgroups for which there is evidence of differential effectiveness?\nNone was identified.\nEstimate of the size of the clinical effectiveness including strength of supporting evidence\nFor the network meta‑analyses and indirect comparisons submitted by the manufacturer, the Committee was aware that, although the point estimates for visual acuity outcomes favoured aflibercept, no statistically significant differences with ranibizumab were reported.\nThe Committee considered the manufacturer's economic model and the ERG's critique and exploratory analyses. The Committee agreed with the ERG that it was unrealistic to assume no second‑eye involvement in the first 2 years of the model because a large proportion of patients in the VIEW 1 and 2 trials had visual impairment in their second eye at the start of treatment. The Committee concluded that the ERG's exploratory approach, which involved separate analyses depending on whether the study eye was a better‑seeing eye or worse‑seeing eye, was more reasonable.\nUncertainties around and plausibility of assumptions and inputs in the economic model\nIncorporation of health‑related quality‑of‑life benefits and utility values\nHave any potential significant and substantial health‑related benefits been identified that were not included in the economic model, and how have they been considered?\nNo specific conclusions were made by the Committee about health‑related quality‑of‑life benefits and utility values.\nWhat are the key drivers of cost effectiveness?\nMost likely cost‑effectiveness estimate (given as an ICER)\nAdditional factors taken into account\nPatient access schemes (PPRS)\nEnd‑of‑life considerations\nNot applicable.\nEqualities considerations and social value judgements\n\n【17】 #Related NICE guidance\nEpiretinal brachytherapy for wet age related macular degeneration.

Pharmacogenetics is generally regarded as the study or clinical testing of genetic variation that gives rise to differing response to drugs, while pharmacogenomics is the broader application of genomic technologies to new drug discovery and further characterization of older drugs. Pharmacogenetics considers one or at most a few genes of interest, while pharmacogenomics considers the entire genome.\n\n【2】 #Pharmacogenetics and adverse drug reactions\nMuch of current clinical interest is at the level of pharmacogenetics, involving variation in genes involved in, drug metabolism with a particular emphasis on improving drug safety. The wider use of pharmacogenetic testing is viewed by many as an outstanding opportunity to improve prescribing safety and efficacy. Driving this trend are the 106,000 deaths and 2.2 Million serious events caused by adverse drug reactions in the US each year (Lazarou 1998). As such ADRs are responsible for 5-7% of hospital admissions in the US and Europe, lead to the withdrawal of 4% of new medicines and cost society an amount equal to the costs of drug treatment (Ingelman-Sundberg 2005). Comparisons of the list of drugs most commonly implicated in adverse drug reactions with the list of metabolizing enzymes with known polymorphisms found that drugs commonly involved in adverse drug reactions were also those that were metabolized by enzymes with known polymorphisms .\n\n【3】 #History\nThe first observations of genetic variation in drug response date from the 1950s, involving the muscle relaxant suxamethonium chloride, and drugs metabolized by N-acetyltransferase. One in 3500 Caucasians has less efficient variant of the enzyme (butyrylcholinesterase) that metabolizes suxamethonium chloride . As a consequence, the drug’s effect is prolonged, with slower recovery from surgical paralysis. Variation in the N-acetyltransferase gene divides people into “slow acetylators” and “fast acetylators”, with very different half-lives and blood concentrations of such important drugs as isoniazid (antituberculosis) and procainamide (antiarrhythmic). As part of the inborn system for clearing the body of xenobiotics, the cytochrome P450 oxidases (CYP450) are heavily involved in drug metabolism, and genetic variations in CYP450s affect large populations.  One member of the CYP450 superfamily, CYP2D6, now has over 75 known allelic variations, some of which lead to no activity, and some to enhanced activity. An estimated 29% of people in parts of East Africa may have multiple copies of the gene, and will therefore not be adequately treated with standard doses of drugs such as the painkiller codeine (which is activated by the enzyme).\n\n【4】 #Thiopurines and TPMT (thiopurine methyl transferase)\nOne of the earliest tests for a genetic variation resulting in a clinically important consequence was on the enzyme thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT). TPMT metabolizes 6-mercaptopurine and azathioprine, two thiopurine drugs used in a range of indications, from childhood leukemia to autoimmune diseases. In people with a deficiency in TPMT activity, thiopurine metabolism must proceed by other pathways, one of which leads to the active thiopurine metabolite that is toxic to the bone marrow at high concentrations.\nDeficiency of TPMT affects a small proportion of people, though seriously. One in 300 people have two variant alleles and lack TPMT activity; these people need only 6-10% of the standard dose of the drug, and, if treated with the full dose, are at risk of severe bone marrow suppression. For them, genotype predicts clinical outcome, a prerequisite for an effective pharmacogenetic test. In 85-90% of affected people, this deficiency results from one of three common variant alleles.\nAround 10% of people are heterozygous - they carry one variant allele - and produce a reduced quantity of functional enzyme. Overall, they are at greater risk of adverse effects, although as individuals their genotype is not necessarily predictive of their clinical outcome, which makes the interpretation of a clinical test difficult. Recent research suggests that patients who are heterozygous may have a better response to treatment, which raises whether people who have two wild-type alleles could tolerate a higher therapeutic dose.\nThe US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have recently deliberated the inclusion of a recommendation for testing for TPMT deficiency to the prescribing information for 6-mercaptopurine and azathioprine. Hitherto the information has carried the warning that inherited deficiency of the enzyme could increase the risk of severe bone marrow suppression. Now it will carry the recommendation that people who develop bone marrow suppression while receiving 6-mercaptopurine or azathioprine be tested for TPMT deficiency.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-05-08 01:38:00", "update_time": "2024-05-08 18:17:11"}

In 1877 Zenker and Ziemssen reviewed the world literature on the Zenker's diverticulum. In 1840 Rokitansky first described traction diverticula of the thoracic esophagus. Until 1816 publication,ZD was thought to be congenital or traumatic in origin. In 1877, von Zeimssen, professor in Munich, published \"Krankheiten des Oesophagus\" on the esophageal ulceration and  diverticula. Preliminary thoughts on managing pharyngoesophageal diverticula originated as early as 1830, when Bell proposed the establishment of a fistula to empty the diverticulum of its contents.\n\n【3】 #Classification\nEsophageal diverticula are classified on the basis of  location into three types Phrenoesophageal (Zenker's diverticulum-70%) ZD is a defect over the Killian's triangle, a point of weakness in the muscular wall of the hypopharynx. Epiphrenic (20%) diverticula result either from hypertonia of the lower esophageal sphincter (esophageal achalasia). Thoracic and mediastinal (10%) Thoracic diverticula are probably more often of a congenital than traction origin.\n\n【4】 #Pathophysiology\nZenker's diverticulum (ZD) is thought to be due to the result of motor abnormalities of the esophagus. The defect over the Killian's triangle, a point of weakness in the muscular wall of the hypopharynx results in ZD. Killian's triangle is surrounded by the cricopharyngeal sphincter and oblique fibers of the inferior constrictor of the pharyngeal muscle. It is considered a pseudodiverticulum as it includes only mucosa and submucosa. Chronic strain on the Killian's triangle leads to an evagination of the sphincter, which may be because of the high pressures in the food bolus in the course of swallowing and the abnormalities of the upper esophageal sphincter (UES). This failure to achieve adequate diameter for effective bolus clearance leads to a subsequent increase in the hypopharyngeal pressure gradient. Increased intra-bolus pressures found in patients with ZD can be secondary to impaired bolus passage combined with the gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or as a result of the GERD. As the diverticulum enlarges, it may compress the pharyngoesophageal segment as well as increased stiffness and the intrabolus pressure. Increased intrabolus pressure is also increased in older patients who perform multiple swallows to achieve bolus clearance. Acid reflux is thought to lead to increased spasm of the UES which in turn increases the intra-bolus pressures during swallowing, given that swallowing is frequently distinct from episodes of acid reflux disease.\n\n【5】 #Causes\nZenker's diverticulum (ZD) also known as pharyngosophageal diverticulum. It is an acquired sac-like outpouching of the mucosa and submucosa layers originating from the pharyngoesophageal junction. Killian's dehiscence a pulsion of false diverticulum occurring dorsally at the pharyngoesophageal wall surrounded by the oblique inferior pharyngeal constrictor muscle and the transversal fibers of the cricopharyngeal muscle. ZD occurs due to increased intraluminal pressure in the oropharynx during swallowing, against an inadequate relaxation of the cricopharyngeal muscle. An incomplete opening of the Upper Esophageal Sphincter (UES) causing the protrusion of the mucosa through an area of relative weakness at the dorsal pharyngoesophageal wall. The pharyngoesophageal phase of swallowing is affected in ZD resulting in hindering the neuromuscular functions such as chewing, initiating the swallowing, and propulsion of the food from the oropharynx into the cervical esophagus.\n\n【6】 #Differentiating Zenker's diverticulum from Other Diseases\nThe differential diagnosis of the Zenker's diverticulum (ZD) are as follows Plummer-Vinson syndrome, reflux esophagitis, esophageal carcinoma, systemic sclerosis, achalasia, psuedoachalasia, chagas disease, esophageal candidiasis, pharyngitis and stroke.\n\n【7】 #Epidemiology and Demographics\nThe incidence ZD is approximately 2 per 100,000 individuals worldwide, The prevalence of ZD is between 0.01 to 0.11% per 100,000 individuals worldwide. The mortality rate is 0.3% for stapled rigid endoscopic procedures. Mortality rate for non-stapled rigid endoscopic procedures is 0.2%. ZD commonly affects middle-aged and elderly individuals, especially people in their 7th and 8th decades.There is no racial predilection to ZD. Males are more commonly affected by ZD than females. The men to women ratio is approximately 1.5 to 1. The majority of ZD cases are reported in northern Europe.\n\n【8】 #Risk Factors\nThe risk factors of the Zenker's diverticulum (ZD) are as follow people in their seventh and eight decades, male, GERD, pre-existing hiatal hernia, esophageal motility disorder, esophagitis, neurological disorders like a stroke.\n\n【9】 #Screening\nThere is insufficient evidence to recommend routine screening for Zenker's diverticulum.\n\n【10】 ## Natural History\n\n【11】 ## Complications\nComplications of the Zenker's diverticulum includes Aspiration pneumonia, Bleeding of the diverticulum, Uuceration of the diverticulum, compression of the trachea and esophageal obstruction with large diverticula, very rarely Squamous cell carcinoma of the diverticulum, Perforation of the diverticulum during the endoscopy and hence scopes with side viewing should be used to prevent perforation.\n\n【12】 ## Prognosis\nPrognosis of ZD after the intervention is good, the recurrence of the diverticulum is very rare.\n\n【13】 ## History and Symptoms\nWhile it may be asymptomatic, Zenker diverticulum often causes clinical manifestations such as dysphagia, globus sensation, regurgitation, cough, halitosis,odynophagia.\n\n【14】 ## Physical Examination\n\n【15】 ## Laboratory Findings\nLaboratory studies are not helpful in the diagnosis of the Zenker's Diverticulum (ZD), whereas they are used for the upper esophageal webs associated with iron deficiency anemia. The laboratory tests are done to differentiate the ZD from Plummer- Vinson syndrome. Laboratory findings consistent with the diagnosis of Plummer-Vinson syndrome include the presence of iron deficiency anemia.\n\n【16】 #X-ray\nAn x-ray (barium esophagogram) is the best initial imaging study in a patient suspected with Zenker's Diverticulum (ZD). Findings on an x-ray (barium esophagogram) suggestive of esophageal diverticulum associated with ZD appear as thin projections on the anterior esophageal wall over the Killian's triangle.\n\n【17】 #CT scan\nZenker's diverticulum appears as an out-pouching sac on the CT scan over the posterior esophagus in the Killian's triangle, a point of weakness in the muscular wall of the hypopharynx surrounded by the cricopharyngeal sphincter and oblique fibers of the inferior constrictor of the pharyngeal muscle.\n\n【18】 #MRI\nZenker's diverticulum appears as an out-pouching sac on the MRI scan over the posterior esophagus in the Killian's triangle, a point of weakness in the muscular wall of the hypopharynx surrounded by the cricopharyngeal sphincter and oblique fibers of the inferior constrictor of the pharyngeal muscle. The sac is filled with, fluid, food, contrast materials.\n\n【19】 ## Medical Therapy\nNo medical treatment is currently known or practiced for symptomatic Zenker diverticulum.\n\n【20】 ## Surgery\nSurgery is the most definitive therapy for the Zenker's diverticulum (ZD). If small and asymptomatic, no treatment is necessary. Larger, symptomatic cases of Zenker's diverticulum have been traditionally treated by neck surgery to resect the diverticulum and incise the cricopharyngeus muscle. However, in recent times non-surgical endoscopic techniques have gained more importance, and the currently preferred treatment is the endoscopic stapling i.e. closing of the diverticulum via a stapler inserted through a tube in the mouth. This may be performed through a fiberoptic endoscope. Other non-surgical treatment modalities exist, such as endoscopic laser, which recent evidence suggests it less effective than stapling.\n\n【21】 ## Prevention\nThere are no established measures for the primary prevention of Zenker's Diverticulum.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-05-08 01:38:00", "update_time": "2024-05-08 18:32:16"}

The guideline outlines evidence-based standards and regulatory expectations (i.ee. how to do it)\n\n【1】 #Introduction\n\n【2】 #Opioid use disorder and treatment\nOpioid use disorder (OUD) is a chronic, relapsing condition that has significant personal, public health and economic consequences. Many of the fatal and non-fatal overdoses in Canada's epidemic over recent years have occurred in people with OUD. OUD may involve prescription medications (including medications that have been diverted from the medical system), or illicitly manufactured opioids, such as heroin or highly potent street fentanyl and fentanyl analogues.\nPeople can achieve sustained long-term remission from OUD with effective treatment and follow-up. The first-line treatment for moderate to severe OUD is opioid agonist therapy (OAT), ideally combined with behavioural and social supports to optimize the determinants of health and address other psychosocial factors that influence substance use and quality of life. OAT can stabilize the cycle of intoxication and withdrawal, reduce opioid cravings and block the intoxicating effects of other shortacting opioids, including fentanyl. People who are maintained on OAT typically experience significantly improved health and social functioning and a considerable reduction in the risk of overdose and all-cause mortality. Some people do not meet criteria for OUD, yet inject or use illicit drugs that can lead to poisonings, overdose and death. This guideline is not applicable to the management of people in these situations, and recommendations for programs and services to address their needs are beyond the scope of this guideline.\n\n【3】 #Background\nEach provincial medical regulatory authority (MRA) has its own set of guidelines and standards for OAT. The aim of this unified guideline is to standardize expectations for Canadian prescribers, but not to replace any adopted guidelines; rather, this guideline was developed to complement existing initiatives and to support prescribers with best practices and evidence. It serves as a \"guideline of guidelines\" by synthesizing key recommendations for treating and managing OUD from existing standards, guidelines, expert opinions and best practices across Canada. The role of the MRAs in regulating the management of OUD varies across the country. Some MRAs write clinical guidelines, provide education and have quality assurance programs that ensure safe OAT prescribing, while in other jurisdictions some of these roles are performed by independent organizations. However, what the MRAs have in common is holding registrants accountable to standards of practice. Prescribers should contact their MRA for specific guidance on this guideline and to clarify regulatory expectations for managing OUD.\n\n【4】 #Audience\nThe primary audience for this document is physicians who prescribe treatment for OUD. However, this guideline may be used by other health care professionals who are authorized to prescribe OAT.\n\n【5】 #Scope and process\nEstablishing new evidence was beyond the scope of this project. Rather, the aim was for representatives from each of the participating MRAs and independent reviewers to reach consensus regarding recommendations from existing guidelines . Targeted searches of peer-reviewed and grey literature were conducted in the cases of guideline discrepancies or topics with varying degrees of evidence. This document is the outcome of that process: it is a product of synthesized guidelines blended with expert opinions and evidence-based literature.\nThe guideline was developed using an iterative process that involved three groups: a subject matter expert group, an MRA advisory committee and an external reviewer panel. Each MRA nominated two subject matter experts and one MRA representative. The subject matter experts reviewed existing guidelines and literature and helped to develop the recommendations in this document. The MRA representatives reviewed the recommendations to ensure that they conform to regulatory standards. An external panel of clinical experts who do not have clear ties to an MRA, as well as people with lived experience, then reviewed the recommendations. The subject matter expert group considered their feedback in finalizing the recommendations.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-05-08 01:38:00", "update_time": "2024-05-08 02:08:12"}

Cholesterol and other products of Cholesterol biosynthesis are essential components for fetal development (including synthesis of steroids and cell membranes). Since statins decrease Cholesterol synthesis and possibly the synthesis of other biologically active substances derived from Cholesterol, they are contraindicated during pregnancy and in nursing mothers. PRAVASTATIN SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED TO WOMEN OF CHILDBEARING AGE ONLY WHEN SUCH PATIENTS ARE HIGHLY UNLIKELY TO CONCEIVE AND HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POTENTIAL HAZARDS. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this class of drug, therapy should be discontinued immediately and the patient apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus .\n\n【22】 ## Nursing Mothers\nA small amount of pravastatin is excreted in human breast milk. Because statins have the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, women who require Pravastatin treatment should not breast-feed their infants .\n\n【23】 ## Skeletal Muscle\nRare cases of rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria have been reported with pravastatin and other drugs in this class. A history of renal impairment may be a risk factor for the development of rhabdomyolysis. Such patients merit closer monitoring for skeletal muscle effects.\nUncomplicated myalgia has also been reported in pravastatin-treated patients . Myopathy, defined as muscle aching or muscle weakness in conjunction with increases in creatine phosphokinase (CPK) values to greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), was rare (less than 0.1%) in pravastatin clinical trials. Myopathy should be considered in any patient with diffuse myalgias, muscle tenderness or weakness, and/or marked elevation of CPK. Predisposing factors include advanced age (≥65), uncontrolled hypothyroidism, and renal impairment.\nThere have been rare reports of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), an autoimmune myopathy, associated with statin use. IMNM is characterized by: proximal muscle weakness and elevated serum CPK, which persist despite discontinuation of statin treatment; muscle biopsy showing necrotizing myopathy without significant inflammation and improvement with immunosuppressive agents.\nAll patients should be advised to promptly report to their physician unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever or if muscle signs and symptoms persist after discontinuing Pravastatin.\nPravastatin therapy should be discontinued if markedly elevated CPK levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed or suspected. Pravastatin therapy should also be temporarily withheld in any patient experiencing an acute or serious condition predisposing to the development of renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis, e.g. sepsis; hypotension; major surgery; trauma; severe metabolic, endocrine, or electrolyte disorders; or uncontrolled epilepsy.\nThe risk of myopathy during treatment with statins is increased with concurrent therapy with either erythromycin, cyclosporine, niacin, or fibrates. However, neither myopathy nor significant increases in CPK levels have been observed in 3 reports involving a total of 100 post-transplant patients (24 renal and 76 cardiac) treated for up to 2 years concurrently with pravastatin 10 to 40 mg and cyclosporine. Some of these patients also received other concomitant immunosuppressive therapies. Further, in clinical trials involving small numbers of patients who were treated concurrently with pravastatin and niacin, there were no reports of myopathy. Also, myopathy was not reported in a trial of combination pravastatin (40 mg/day) and gemfibrozil (1200 mg/day), although 4 of 75 patients on the combination showed marked CPK elevations versus 1 of 73 patients receiving placebo. There was a trend toward more frequent CPK elevations and patient withdrawals due to musculoskeletal symptoms in the group receiving combined treatment as compared with the groups receiving placebo, gemfibrozil, or pravastatin monotherapy. The use of fibrates alone may occasionally be associated with myopathy. The benefit of further alterations in lipid levels by the combined use of Pravastatin with fibrates should be carefully weighed against the potential risks of this combination.\nCases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with pravastatin coadministered with colchicine, and caution should be exercised when prescribing pravastatin with colchicine .\n\n【24】 ## Liver\nStatins, like some other lipid-lowering therapies, have been associated with biochemical abnormalities of liver function. In 3 long-term (4.8-5.9 years), placebo-controlled clinical trials (WOS, LIPID, CARE), 19,592 subjects  in the rates of ALT elevation.\nIt is recommended that liver function tests be performed prior to the initiation of therapy and when clinically indicated.\nActive liver disease or unexplained persistent transaminase elevations are contraindications to the use of pravastatin . Caution should be exercised when pravastatin is administered to patients who have a recent (<6 months) history of liver disease, have signs that may suggest liver disease (e.g. unexplained aminotransferase elevations, jaundice), or are heavy users of alcohol.\nThere have been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including pravastatin. If serious liver injury with clinical symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs during treatment with Pravastatin, promptly interrupt therapy. If an alternate etiology is not found do not restart Pravastatin.\n\n【25】 ## Endocrine Function\nStatins interfere with cholesterol synthesis and lower circulating cholesterol levels and, as such, might theoretically blunt adrenal or gonadal steroid hormone production. Results of clinical trials with pravastatin in males and post-menopausal females were inconsistent with regard to possible effects of the drug on basal steroid hormone levels. In a study of 21 males, the mean testosterone response to human chorionic gonadotropin was significantly reduced (less than 0.004) after 16 weeks of treatment with 40 mg of pravastatin. However, the percentage of patients showing a ≥50% rise in plasma testosterone after human chorionic gonadotropin stimulation did not change significantly after therapy in these patients. The effects of statins on spermatogenesis and fertility have not been studied in adequate numbers of patients. The effects, if any, of pravastatin on the pituitary-gonadal axis in pre-menopausal females are unknown. Patients treated with pravastatin who display clinical evidence of endocrine dysfunction should be evaluated appropriately. Caution should also be exercised if a statin or other agent used to lower cholesterol levels is administered to patients also receiving other drugs (e.g. ketoconazole, spironolactone, cimetidine) that may diminish the levels or activity of steroid hormones.\nIn a placebo-controlled study of 214 pediatric patients with HeFH, of which 106 were treated with pravastatin (20 mg in the children aged 8-13 years and 40 mg in the adolescents aged 14-18 years) for 2 years, there were no detectable differences seen in any of the endocrine parameters (ACTH, cortisol, DHEAS, FSH, LH, TSH, estradiol  or testosterone ) relative to placebo. There were no detectable differences seen in height and weight changes, testicular volume changes, or Tanner score relative to placebo.\n\n【26】 ### Short-Term Controlled Trials\nIn the Pravastatin placebo-controlled clinical trials database of 1313 patients (age range 20-76 years, 32.4% women, 93.5% Caucasians, 5% Blacks, 0.9% Hispanics, 0.4% Asians, 0.2% Others) with a median treatment duration of 14 weeks, 3.3% of patients on Pravastatin and 1.2% patients on placebo discontinued due to adverse events regardless of causality. The most common adverse reactions that led to treatment discontinuation and occurred at an incidence greater than placebo were: liver function test increased, nausea, anxiety/depression, and dizziness.\n\n【27】 The safety and tolerability of Pravastatin at a dose of 80 mg in 2 controlled trials with a mean exposure of 8.6 months was similar to that of Pravastatin at lower doses except that 4 out of 464 patients taking 80 mg of pravastatin had a single elevation of CK greater than10 times ULN compared to 0 out of 115 patients taking 40 mg of pravastatin.\n\n【28】 ### Long-Term Controlled Morbidity and Mortality Trials\nIn the Pravastatin placebo-controlled clinical trials database of 21,483 patients (age range 24-75 years, 10.3% women, 52.3% Caucasians, 0.8% Blacks, 0.5% Hispanics, 0.1% Asians, 0.1% Others, 46.1% Not Recorded) with a median treatment duration of 261 weeks, 8.1% of patients on Pravastatin and 9.3% patients on placebo discontinued due to adverse events regardless of causality.\n\n【29】 Dermatologic: scalp hair abnormality (including alopecia), urticaria.\nEndocrine/Metabolic: sexual dysfunction, libido change.\nGeneral: flushing.\nImmunologic:allergy, edema head/neck.\nMusculoskeletal: muscle weakness.\nNervous System:vertigo, insomnia, memory impairment, neuropathy (including peripheral neuropathy).\nSpecial Senses: taste disturbance.\n\n【30】 ## Postmarketing Experience\nIn addition to the events reported above, as with other drugs in this class, the following events have been reported rarely during postmarketing experience with Pravastatin, regardless of causality assessment:\nMusculoskeletal: myopathy,rhabdomyolysis.\nThere have been rare reports of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy associated withstatin use .\nNervous System: dysfunction of certain cranial nerves (including alteration of taste, impairment of extraocular movement, facial paresis), peripheral nerve palsy.\nThere have been rare postmarketing reports of cognitive impairment (e.g. memory loss, forgetfulness, amnesia, memory impairment, confusion) associated with statin use. These cognitive issues have been reported for all statins. The reports are generally nonserious, and reversible upon statin discontinuation, with variable times to symptom onset (1 day to years) and symptom resolution (median of 3 weeks).\nHypersensitivity: anaphylaxis, angioedema, lupus erythematosus-like syndrome, polymyalgia rheumatica, dermatomyositis, vasculitis, purpura, hemolytic anemia, positive ANA, ESR increase, arthritis, arthralgia, asthenia, photosensitivity, chills, malaise, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme (including Stevens-Johnson syndrome).\nGastrointestinal: abdominal pain, constipation, pancreatitis, hepatitis (including chronic active hepatitis), cholestatic jaundice, fatty change in liver, cirrhosis, fulminant hepatic necrosis, hepatoma, fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure.\nDermatologc: a variety of skin changes (e.g. nodules, discoloration, dryness of mucous membranes, changes to hair/nails).\nRenal: urinary abnormality (including dysuria, frequency, nocturia).\nRespiratory:dyspnea.\nReproductive:gynecomastia.\nLaboratory Abnormalities: liver function test abnormalities, thyroid function abnormalities.\n\n【31】 ## Laboratory Test Abnormalities\nIncreases in ALT, AST values and CPK have been observed .\nTransient, asymptomatic eosinophilia has been reported. Eosinophil counts usually returned to normal despite continued therapy. Anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia have been reported with statins.\n\n【32】 ## Pediatric Patients\nIn a 2-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled study involving 100 boys and 114 girls with HeFH (n=214; age range 8-18.5 years, 53% female, 95% Caucasians, <1% Blacks, 3% Asians, 1% Other), the safety and tolerability profile of pravastatin was generally similar to that of placebo.\n\n【33】 ## Cyclosporine\nThe risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysisis increased with concomitant administration of Cyclosporine. Limit pravastatin to 20 mg once daily for concomitant use with Cyclosporine .\n\n【34】 ## Clarithromycin\nThe risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysisis increased with concomitant administration of Clarithromycin. Limit pravastatin to 40 mg once daily for concomitant use with Clarithromycin .\n\n【35】 ## Colchicine\nThe risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis is increased with concomitant administration of colchicine .\n\n【36】 ## Gemfibrozil\nDue to an increased risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysiswhen HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are coadministered with gemfibrozil, concomitant administration of Pravastatin with gemfibrozil should be avoided .\n\n【37】 ## Other Fibrates\nBecause it is known that the risk of myopathy during treatment with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors is increased with concurrent administration of other fibrates, Pravastatin should be administered with caution when used concomitantly with other fibrates .\n\n【38】 ## Niacin\nThe risk of skeletal muscle effects may be enhanced when pravastatin is used in combination with niacin; a reduction in Pravastatin dosage should be considered in this setting .\n\n【39】 ### Pregnancy\nPregnancy Category (FDA): X\nSafety in pregnant women has not been established. Available data in women inadvertently taking pravastatin while pregnant do not suggest any adverse clinical events. However, there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Therefore, it is not known whether pravastatin can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproductive capacity. Pravastatin should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the fetus and patients have been informed of the potential hazards.\nRare reports of congenital anomalies have been received following intrauterine exposure to other statins. In a review2 of approximately 100 prospectively followed pregnancies in women exposed to simvastatin or lovastatin, the incidences of congenital anomalies, spontaneous abortions, and fetal deaths/stillbirths did not exceed what would be expected in the general population. The number of cases is adequate to exclude a ≥3- to 4-fold increase in congenital anomalies over the background incidence. In 89% of the prospectively followed pregnancies, drug treatment was initiated prior to pregnancy and was discontinued at some point in the first trimester when pregnancy was identified. As safety in pregnant women has not been established and there is no apparent benefit to therapy with Pravastatin during pregnancy , treatment should be immediately discontinued as soon as pregnancy is recognized. Pravastatin should be administered to women of childbearing potential only when such patients are highly unlikely to conceive and have been informed of the potential hazards.\nPravastatin was neither embryolethal nor teratogenic in rats at doses up to 1000 mg/kg daily or in rabbits at doses of up to 50 mg/kg daily. These doses resulted in 10 times (rabbit) or 120 times (rat) the human exposure at 80 mg/day maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on surface area (mg/m2).\nIn pregnant rats given oral gavage doses of 4, 20, 100, 500, and 1000 mg/kg/day from gestation days 7 through 17 (organogenesis) increased mortality of offspring and skeletal anomalies were observed at 100 mg/kg/day systemic exposure, 10 times the human exposure at 80 mg/day MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m2).\nThere is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Pravastatin sandbox in women who are pregnant.\n\n【40】 ### Labor and Delivery\nThere is no FDA guidance on use of Pravastatin sandbox during labor and delivery.\n\n【41】 ### Nursing Mothers\nA small amount of pravastatin is excreted in human breast milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, women taking Pravastatin should not nurse .\nPravastatin crosses the placenta and is found in fetal tissue at 30% maternal plasma levels following a single 20 mg/kg dose given to pregnant rats on gestation day 18. Similar studies in lactating rats indicate secretion of pravastatin into breast milk at 0.2 to 6.5 times higher levels than maternal plasma at exposures equivalent to 2 times human exposure at the MRHD.\n\n【42】 ### Pediatric Use\nThe safety and effectiveness of Pravastatin in children and adolescents from 8 to 18 years of age have been evaluated in a placebo-controlled study of 2 years duration. Patients treated with pravastatin had an adverse experience profile generally similar to that of patients treated with placebo with influenza and headache commonly reported in both treatment groups.  Doses greater than 40 mg have not been studied in this population. Children and adolescent females of childbearing potential should be counseled on appropriate contraceptive methods while on pravastatin therapy . For dosing information\nDouble-blind, placebo-controlled pravastatin studies in children less than 8 years of age have not been conducted.\n\n【43】 ### Geriatic Use\nTwo secondary prevention trials with pravastatin (CARE and LIPID) included a total of 6593 subjects treated with pravastatin 40 mg for periods ranging up to 6 years. Across these 2 studies, 36.1% of pravastatin subjects were aged 65 and older and 0.8% were aged 75 and older. The beneficial effect of pravastatin in elderly subjects in reducing cardiovascular events and in modifying lipid profiles was similar to that seen in younger subjects. The adverse event profile in the elderly was similar to that in the overall population. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses to pravastatin between elderly and younger patients.\n\n【44】 ### Gender\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Pravastatin sandbox with respect to specific gender populations.\n\n【45】 ### Race\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Pravastatin sandbox with respect to specific racial populations.\n\n【46】 ### Renal Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Pravastatin sandbox in patients with renal impairment.\n\n【47】 ### Hepatic Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Pravastatin sandbox in patients with hepatic impairment.\n\n【48】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Pravastatin sandbox in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n\n【49】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\nThere is no FDA guidance one the use of Pravastatin sandbox in patients who are immunocompromised.\n\n【50】 ### Administration\nOral\n\n【51】 ### Monitoring\nFDA Package Insert for Pravastatin contains no information regarding drug monitoring.\n\n【52】 #IV Compatibility\nFDA Package Insert for Pravastatin contains no information regarding IV compatibility.\n\n【53】 #Overdosage\nTo date, there has been limited experience with overdosage of pravastatin. If an overdose occurs, it should be treated symptomatically with laboratory monitoring and supportive measures should be instituted as required\n\n【54】 ## Mechanism of Action\nPravastatin is a reversible inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, an early and rate limiting step in the biosynthetic pathway for cholesterol. In addition, pravastatin reduces VLDL and TG and increases HDL-C.\n\n【55】 ## Structure\nPravastatin (pravastatin sodium) is one of a class of lipid-lowering compounds, the statins, which reduce cholesterol biosynthesis. These agents are competitive inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase, the enzyme catalyzing the early rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis, conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate.\nPravastatin sodium is designated chemically as 1-Naphthalene-heptanoic acid, 1,2,6,7,8,8a-hexahydro-β,δ,6-trihydroxy-2-methyl-8-(2-methyl-1-oxobutoxy)-, monosodium salt, -.\nStructural formula:\nPravastatin is available for oral administration as 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, and 80 mg tablets. Inactive ingredients include: croscarmellose sodium, lactose, magnesium oxide, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, and povidone. The 10 mg tablet also contains Red Ferric Oxide, the 20 mg and 80 mg tablets also contain Yellow Ferric Oxide, and the 40 mg tablet also contains Green Lake Blend .\n\n【56】 ## Pharmacodynamics\nFDA Package Insert for Pravastatin contains no information regarding pharmacodynamics.\n\n【57】 ### General\nAbsorption: Pravastatin is administered orally in the active form. In studies in man, peak plasma pravastatin concentrations occurred 1 to 1.5 hours upon oral administration. Based on urinary recovery of total radiolabeled drug, the average oral absorption of pravastatin is 34% and absolute bioavailability is 17%. While the presence of food in the gastrointestinal tract reduces systemic bioavailability, the lipid-lowering effects of the drug are similar whether taken with or 1 hour prior to meals.\nPravastatin plasma concentrations, including area under the concentration-time curve (AUC), Cmax, and steady-state minimum (Cmin), are directly proportional to administered dose. Systemic bioavailability of pravastatin administered following a bedtime dose was decreased 60% compared to that following an AM dose. Despite this decrease in systemic bioavailability, the efficacy of pravastatin administered once daily in the evening, although not statistically significant, was marginally more effective than that after a morning dose.\nThe coefficient of variation (CV), based on between-subject variability, was 50% to 60% for AUC. The geometric means of pravastatin Cmax and AUC following a 20 mg dose in the fasted state were 26.5 ng/mL and 59.8 ng*hr/mL, respectively.\n\n【58】 Distribution: Approximately 50% of the circulating drug is bound to plasma proteins.\nMetabolism: The major biotransformation pathways for pravastatin are: (a) isomerization to 6-epi pravastatin and the 3α-hydroxyisomer of pravastatin (SQ 31,906) and (b) enzymatic ring hydroxylation to SQ 31,945. The 3α-hydroxyisomeric metabolite (SQ 31,906) has 1/10 to 1/40 the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity of the parent compound. Pravastatin undergoes extensive first-pass extraction in the liver (extraction ratio 0.66).\nExcretion: Approximately 20% of a radiolabeled oral dose is excreted in urine and 70% in the feces. After intravenous administration of radiolabeled pravastatin to normal volunteers, approximately 47% of total body clearance was via renal excretion and 53% by non-renal routes (i.e. biliary excretion and biotransformation).\nFollowing single dose oral administration of 14C-pravastatin, the radioactive elimination t½ for pravastatin is 1.8 hours in humans.\n\n【59】 ### Specific Populations\nRenal Impairment: A single 20 mg oral dose of pravastatin was administered to 24 patients with varying degrees of renal impairment (as determined by creatinine clearance). No effect was observed on the pharmacokinetics of pravastatin or its 3α-hydroxy isomeric metabolite (SQ 31,906). Compared to healthy subjects with normal renal function, patients with severe renal impairment had 69% and 37% higher mean AUC and Cmax values, respectively, and a 0.61 hour shorter t½ for the inactive enzymatic ring hydroxylation metabolite (SQ 31,945).\nHepatic Impairment: In a study comparing the kinetics of pravastatin in patients with biopsy confirmed cirrhosis (N=7) and normal subjects (N=7), the mean AUC varied 18-fold in cirrhotic patients and 5-fold in healthy subjects. Similarly, the peak pravastatin values varied 47-fold for cirrhotic patients compared to 6-fold for healthy subjects.\n\n【60】 Pediatric: After 2 weeks of once-daily 20 mg oral pravastatin administration, the geometric means of AUC were 80.7 (CV 44%) and 44.8 (CV 89%) ng*hr/mL for children (8-11 years, N=14) and adolescents (12-16 years, N=10), respectively. The corresponding values for Cmax were 42.4 (CV 54%) and 18.6 ng/mL (CV 100%) for children and adolescents, respectively\n\n【61】 In a 2-year study in rats fed pravastatin at doses of 10, 30, or 100 mg/kg body weight, there was an increased incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas in males at the highest dose . These effects in rats were observed at approximately 12 times the human dose (HD) of 80 mg based on body surface area (mg/m2) and at approximately 4 times the HD, based on AUC.\nNo evidence of mutagenicity was observed in vitro, with or without rat-liver metabolic activation, in the following studies: microbial mutagen tests, using mutant strains ofSalmonella typhimurium or Escherichia coli; a forward mutation assay in L5178Y TK +/− mouse lymphoma cells; a chromosomal aberration test in hamster cells; and a gene conversion assay using Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In addition, there was no evidence of mutagenicity in either a dominant lethal test in mice or a micronucleus test in mice.\nIn a fertility study in adult rats with daily doses up to 500 mg/kg, pravastatin did not produce any adverse effects on fertility or general reproductive performance.\n\n【62】 ### CNS Toxicity\nCNS vascular lesions, characterized by perivascular hemorrhage and edema and mononuclear cell infiltration of perivascular spaces, were seen in dogs treated with pravastatin at a dose of 25 mg/kg/day. These effects in dogs were observed at approximately 59 times the HD of 80 mg/day, based on AUC. Similar CNS vascular lesions have been observed with several other drugs in this class.\nA chemically similar drug in this class produced optic nerve degeneration (Wallerian degeneration of retinogeniculate fibers) in clinically normal dogs in a dose-dependent fashion starting at 60 mg/kg/day, a dose that produced mean plasma drug levels about 30 times higher than the mean drug level in humans taking the highest recommended dose (as measured by total enzyme inhibitory activity). This same drug also produced vestibulocochlear Wallerian-like degeneration and retinal ganglion cell chromatolysis in dogs treated for 14 weeks at 180 mg/kg/day, a dose which resulted in a mean plasma drug level similar to that seen with the 60 mg/kg/day dose.\nWhen administered to juvenile rats (postnatal days  4 through 80 at 5-45 mg/kg/day), no drug related changes were observed at 5 mg/kg/day. At 15 and 45 mg/kg/day, altered body-weight gain was observed during the dosing and 52-day recovery periods as well as slight thinning of the corpus callosum at the end of the recovery period. This finding was not evident in rats examined at the completion of the dosing period and was not associated with any inflammatory or degenerative changes in the brain. The biological relevance of the corpus callosum finding is uncertain due to the absence of any other microscopic changes in the brain or peripheral nervous tissue and because it occurred at the end of the recovery period. Neurobehavioral changes (enhanced acoustic startle responses and increased errors in water-maze learning) combined with evidence of generalized toxicity were noted at 45 mg/kg/day during the later part of the recovery period. Serum pravastatin levels at 15 mg/kg/day are approximately ≥1 times (AUC) the maximum pediatric dose of 40 mg. No thinning of the corpus callosum was observed in rats dosed with pravastatin (≥250 mg/kg/day) beginning PND 35 for 3 months suggesting increased sensitivity in younger rats. PND 35 in a rat is approximately equivalent to an 8- to 12-year-old human child. Juvenile male rats given 90 times (AUC) the 40 mg dose had decreased fertility (20%) with sperm abnormalities compared to controls.\n\n【63】 #Clinical Studies\n14.1 Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease\nIn the Pravastatin Primary Prevention Study (WOS),3 the effect of Pravastatin on fatal and nonfatal CHD was assessed in 6595 men 45 to 64 years of age, without a previous MI, and with LDL-C levels between 156 to 254 mg/dL (4-6.7 mmol/L). In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, patients were treated with standard care, including dietary advice, and either Pravastatin 40 mg daily (N=3302) or placebo (N=3293) and followed for a median duration of 4.8 years. Median (25th, 75th percentile) percent changes from baseline after 6 months of pravastatin treatment in Total-C, LDL-C, TG, and HDL-C were −20.3 (−26.9, −11.7), −27.7 (−36.0, −16.9), −9.1 (−27.6, 12.5), and 6.7 (−2.1, 15.6), respectively.\nPravastatin significantly reduced the rate of first coronary events (either CHD death or nonfatal MI) by 31% (248 events in the placebo group  versus 174 events in the Pravastatin group , p=0.0001 ). The risk reduction with Pravastatin was similar and significant throughout the entire range of baseline LDL cholesterol levels. This reduction was also similar and significant across the age range studied with a 40% risk reduction for patients younger than 55 years and a 27% risk reduction for patients 55 years and older. The Pravastatin Primary Prevention Study included only men, and therefore it is not clear to what extent these data can be extrapolated to a similar population of female patients.\nPravastatin also significantly decreased the risk for undergoing myocardial revascularization procedures (coronary artery bypass graft  surgery or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty ) by 37% (80 vs 51 patients, p=0.009) and coronary angiography by 31% (128 vs 90, p=0.007). Cardiovascular deaths were decreased by 32% (73 vs 50, p=0.03) and there was no increase in death from non-cardiovascular causes.\n\n【64】 ### Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular Events\nIn the LIPID4 study, the effect of Pravastatin, 40 mg daily, was assessed in 9014 patients (7498 men; 1516 women; 3514 elderly patients ; 782 diabetic patients) who had experienced either an MI (5754 patients) or had been hospitalized for unstable angina pectoris (3260 patients) in the preceding 3 to 36 months. Patients in this multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study participated for an average of 5.6 years (median of 5.9 years) and at randomization had Total-C between 114 and 563 mg/dL (mean 219 mg/dL), LDL-C between 46 and 274 mg/dL (mean 150 mg/dL), TG between 35 and 2710 mg/dL (mean 160 mg/dL), and HDL-C between 1 and 103 mg/dL (mean 37 mg/dL). At baseline, 82% of patients were receiving aspirin and 76% were receiving antihypertensive medication. Treatment with Pravastatin significantly reduced the risk for total mortality by reducing coronary death . The risk reduction due to treatment with Pravastatin on CHD mortality was consistent regardless of age. Pravastatin significantly reduced the risk for total mortality (by reducing CHD death) and CHD events (CHD mortality or nonfatal MI) in patients who qualified with a history of either MI or hospitalization for unstable angina pectoris.\n\n【65】 In the REGRESS7 study, the effect of pravastatin on coronary atherosclerosis was assessed by coronary angiography in 885 patients with angina pectoris, angiographically documented coronary artery disease, and hypercholesterolemia (baseline total cholesterol range: 160-310 mg/dL). In this double-blind, multicenter, controlled clinical trial, angiograms were evaluated at baseline and at 2 years in 653 patients (323 treated with pravastatin). Progression of coronary atherosclerosis was significantly slowed in the pravastatin group as assessed by changes in mean segment diameter  and minimum obstruction diameter .\nAnalysis of pooled events from PLAC I, PLAC II,8 REGRESS, and KAPS9 studies (combined N=1891) showed that treatment with pravastatin was associated with a statistically significant reduction in the composite event rate of fatal and nonfatal MI (46 events or 6.4% for placebo versus 21 events or 2.4% for pravastatin, p=0.001). The predominant effect of pravastatin was to reduce the rate of nonfatal MI.\n\n【66】 ### Primary Hypercholesterolemia (Fredrickson Types IIa and IIb)\nPravastatin is highly effective in reducing Total-C, LDL-C, and TG in patients with heterozygous familial, presumed familial combined, and non-familial (non-FH) forms of primary hypercholesterolemia, and mixed dyslipidemia. A therapeutic response is seen within 1 week, and the maximum response usually is achieved within 4 weeks. This response is maintained during extended periods of therapy. In addition, Pravastatin is effective in reducing the risk of acute coronary events in hypercholesterolemic patients with and without previous MI.\nA single daily dose is as effective as the same total daily dose given twice a day. In multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of patients with primary hypercholesterolemia, treatment with pravastatin in daily doses ranging from 10 to 40 mg consistently and significantly decreased Total-C, LDL-C, TG, and Total-C/HDL-C and LDL-C/HDL-C ratios .\nIn a pooled analysis of 2 multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of patients with primary hypercholesterolemia, treatment with pravastatin at a daily dose of 80 mg (N=277) significantly decreased Total-C, LDL-C, and TG. The 25th and 75th percentile changes from baseline in LDL-C for pravastatin 80 mg were −43% and −30%. The efficacy results of the individual studies were consistent with the pooled data .\nTreatment with Pravastatin modestly decreased VLDL-C and Pravastatin across all doses produced variable increases in HDL-C .\n\n【67】 ### Hypertriglyceridemia (Fredrickson Type IV)\nThe response to pravastatin in patients with Type IV hyperlipidemia (baseline TG >200 mg/dL and LDL-C <160 mg/dL) was evaluated in a subset of 429 patients from the CARE study. For pravastatin-treated subjects, the median (min, max) baseline TG level was 246.0 (200.5, 349.5) mg/dL\n14.5 Dysbetalipoproteinemia (Fredrickson Type III)\n\n【68】 ### Pediatric Clinical Study\nA double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 214 patients (100 boys and 114 girls) with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH), aged 8 to 18 years was conducted for 2 years. The children (aged 8-13 years) were randomized to placebo (N=63) or 20 mg of pravastatin daily (N=65) and the adolescents (aged 14-18 years) were randomized to placebo (N=45) or 40 mg of pravastatin daily (N=41). Inclusion in the study required an LDL-C level greater than 95th percentile for age and sex and one parent with either a clinical or molecular diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolemia. The mean baseline LDL-C value was 239 mg/dL and 237 mg/dL in the pravastatin (range: 151-405 mg/dL) and placebo (range: 154-375 mg/dL) groups, respectively.\nPravastatin significantly decreased plasma levels of LDL-C, Total-C, and ApoB in both children and adolescents . The effect of pravastatin treatment in the 2 age groups was similar.\nThe mean achieved LDL-C was 186 mg/dL (range: 67-363 mg/dL) in the pravastatin group compared to 236 mg/dL (range: 105-438 mg/dL) in the placebo group.\nThe safety and efficacy of pravastatin doses above 40 mg daily have not been studied in children. The long-term efficacy of pravastatin therapy in childhood to reduce morbidity and mortality in adulthood has not been established.\n\n【69】 #How Supplied\nPravastatin (pravastatin sodium) Tablets are supplied as:\n10 mg tablets: Pink to peach, rounded, rectangular-shaped, biconvex with a “P” embossed on one side and “Pravastatin 10” engraved on the opposite side.

In addition, all subjects enrolled in the trials were allowed to take fever-reducing medications.\nOf 1355 subjects enrolled in these two trials, 849 (63%) subjects were influenza-infected (age range 18 to 65 years; median age 34 years; 52% male; 90% Caucasian; 31% smokers). Of the 849 influenza-infected subjects, 95% were infected with influenza A, 3% with influenza B, and 2% with influenza of unknown type.\nTAMIFLU was started within 40 hours of onset of symptoms. Subjects participating in the trials were required to self-assess the influenza-associated symptoms as \"none,\" \"mild,\" \"moderate,\" or \"severe.\" Time to improvement was calculated from the time of treatment initiation to the time when all symptoms (nasal congestion, sore throat, cough, aches, fatigue, headaches, and chills/sweats) were assessed as \"none\" or \"mild.\" In both studies, at the recommended dose of TAMIFLU 75 mg twice daily for 5 days, there was a 1.3 day reduction in the median time to improvement in influenza-infected subjects receiving TAMIFLU compared to subjects receiving placebo. Subgroup analyses of these studies by gender showed no differences in the treatment effect of TAMIFLU in men and women.\nIn the treatment of influenza, no increased efficacy was demonstrated in subjects receiving treatment of 150 mg TAMIFLU twice daily for 5 days.\n\n【2】 ### Geriatric Subjects\nThree double-blind placebo-controlled treatment trials were conducted in subjects ≥65 years of age in three consecutive seasons. The enrollment criteria were similar to that of adult trials with the exception of fever being defined as >97.5°F. Of 741 subjects enrolled, 476 (65%) subjects were influenza-infected. Of the 476 influenza-infected subjects, 95% were infected with influenza type A and 5% with influenza type B.\nIn the pooled analysis, at the recommended dose of TAMIFLU 75 mg twice daily for 5 days, there was a 1-day reduction in the median time to improvement in influenza-infected subjects receiving TAMIFLU compared to those receiving placebo . However, the magnitude of treatment effect varied between studies.\n\n【3】 ### Pediatric Subjects (1 to 12 years of age)\nOne double-blind placebo-controlled treatment trial was conducted in pediatric subjects aged 1 to 12 years (median age 5 years), who had fever (>100°F) plus one respiratory symptom (cough or coryza) when influenza virus was known to be circulating in the community. Of 698 subjects enrolled in this trial, 452 (65%) were influenza-infected (50% male; 68% Caucasian). Of the 452 influenza-infected subjects, 67% were infected with influenza A and 33% with influenza B.\nThe primary endpoint in this study was the time to freedom from illness, a composite endpoint that required 4 individual conditions to be met. These were: alleviation of cough, alleviation of coryza, resolution of fever, and parental opinion of a return to normal health and activity. TAMIFLU treatment of 2 mg/kg twice daily, started within 48 hours of onset of symptoms, significantly reduced the total composite time to freedom from illness by 1.5 days compared to placebo. Subgroup analyses of this study by gender showed no differences in the treatment effect of TAMIFLU in male and female pediatric subjects.\n\n【4】 ### Pediatric Subjects (2 weeks to less than 1 year of age)\nTwo open label trials evaluated the safety and pharmacokinetics of oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate in influenza infected pediatric subjects 2 weeks to less than 1 year of age (including premature infants at least 36 weeks post conceptional age). Subjects received TAMIFLU at doses ranging from 2 to 3.5 mg/kg twice daily for 5 days depending on subject age. These clinical trials were not designed to evaluate clinical efficacy or virologic response.\nOf the 136 subjects under the age of 1 year enrolled and dosed in the trials, the majority of the subjects were male (55%), white (79%), non-Hispanic (74%), full term (76%) and infected with influenza A (80%). Pharmacokinetic data indicated that a dose of 3 mg/kg twice daily in pediatric subjects 2 weeks to less than 1 year of age provided TAMIFLU concentrations similar to or higher than those observed in older pediatric subjects and adults receiving the approved dose and, by extrapolation, is expected to provide similar efficacy. The trials provided adequate safety data to support this dose selection .\n\n【5】 ### Adult and Adolescent Subjects (13 years of age and older)\nThe efficacy of TAMIFLU in preventing naturally occurring influenza illness has been demonstrated in three seasonal prophylaxis studies and a postexposure prophylaxis study in households. The primary efficacy parameter for all these studies was the incidence of laboratory-confirmed clinical influenza. Laboratory-confirmed clinical influenza was defined as oral temperature ≥99.0°F/37.2°C plus at least one respiratory symptom (cough, sore throat, nasal congestion) and at least one constitutional symptom (aches and pain, fatigue, headache, chills/sweats), all recorded within 24 hours, plus either a positive virus isolation or a four-fold increase in virus antibody titers from baseline.\nIn a pooled analysis of two seasonal prophylaxis studies in healthy unvaccinated adults (aged 13 to 65 years), TAMIFLU 75 mg once daily taken for 42 days during a community outbreak reduced the incidence of laboratory-confirmed clinical influenza from 5% (25/519) for the placebo group to 1% (6/520) for the TAMIFLU group.\n\n【6】 ### Pediatric Subjects (1 to 12 years of age)\nThe efficacy of TAMIFLU in preventing naturally occurring influenza illness has been demonstrated in a randomized, open-label, postexposure prophylaxis study in households that included pediatric subjects aged 1 to 12 years, both as index cases and as family contacts. All index cases in this study received treatment. The primary efficacy parameter for this study was the incidence of laboratory-confirmed clinical influenza in the household. Laboratory-confirmed clinical influenza was defined as oral temperature ≥100°F/37.8°C plus cough and/or coryza recorded within 48 hours, plus either a positive virus isolation or a four-fold or greater increase in virus antibody titers from baseline or at illness visits. Among household contacts 1 to 12 years of age not already shedding virus at baseline, TAMIFLU for oral suspension 30 mg to 60 mg taken once daily for 10 days reduced the incidence of laboratory-confirmed clinical influenza from 17% (18/106) in the group not receiving prophylaxis to 3% (3/95) in the group receiving prophylaxis.\n\n【7】 ### Immunocompromised Subjects\nA double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted for seasonal prophylaxis of influenza in 475 immunocompromised subjects (including 18 pediatric subjects 1 to 12 years of age) who had received solid organ (n=388; liver, kidney, liver and kidney) or hematopoietic stem cell transplants (n=87). Median time since transplant for solid organ transplant recipients was 1105 days for the placebo group and 1379 days for the oseltamivir group. Median time since transplant for hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients was 424 days for the placebo group and 367 days for the oseltamivir group. Approximately 40% of subjects received influenza vaccine prior to entering the study. The primary efficacy endpoint for this study was the incidence of confirmed, clinical influenza, defined as oral temperature >99.0°F/37.2°C plus cough and/or coryza, all recorded within 24 hours, plus either a positive virus culture or a four-fold increase in virus antibody titers from baseline. The incidence of confirmed clinical influenza was 3% (7/238) in the group not receiving TAMIFLU compared with 2% (5/237) in the group receiving TAMIFLU; this difference was not statistically significant. A secondary analysis was performed using the same clinical symptoms and RT-PCR for laboratory confirmation of influenza. Among subjects who were not already shedding virus at baseline, the incidence of RT-PCR-confirmed clinical influenza was 3% (7/231) in the group not receiving TAMIFLU and <1% (1/232) in the group receiving TAMIFLU.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-05-08 01:38:00", "update_time": "2024-05-08 18:51:32"}

D-norpseudoephedrine is also known as cathine, and occurs naturally in the stimulant plant Catha edulis (khat). This isomer is commonly used in European medications described as \"phenylpropanolamine\", whereas in the United States a racemic mixture of d,l-norephedrine is usual.\nJust as ephedrine is chemically reduced into methamphetamine, phenylpropanolamine can be chemically reduced into amphetamine. Molecularly, phenylpropanolamine is to ephedrine, just as amphetamine is to methamphetamine, and as cathinone is to methcathinone.\nPhenylpropanolamine was also used for the illicit synthesis of other stimulant drugs such as phenmetrazine and 4-methylaminorex, and since phenylpropanolamine was withdrawn from use in humans in the early 2000s (although it is still sold for some veterinary applications) it is now much less available, and this in turn has meant that phenmetrazine and 4-methylaminorex have largely disappeared from the illicit market.\nPhenylpropanolamine can be made from cathinone.\n\n【3】 #Side effects\nA scientific study found an increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke in women who used phenylpropanolamine, although it is not clear which isomer is to blame.

Where clinicians believe that an individual child's adherence to the press-and-breathe pMDI and spacer combination is likely to be so poor as to undermine effective asthma control, other alternative devices (taking account of the factors outlined in 1.1 and evidence of equivalence of clinical effectiveness) should be considered, bearing in mind the need to minimise the risks of systemic absorption of corticosteroids.\nIn the case of other inhaled drugs, primarily bronchodilators, it is recommended that a wider range of devices be considered to take account of their more frequent spontaneous use, the greater need for portability, and the clear feedback that symptom response provides to the device user. In such circumstances the factors outlined in 1.1 are likely to be of greater importance in choosing a device.\nWhere more than one device satisfies the considerations outlined above in a particular child, it is recommended that the device with the lowest overall cost (taking into account daily required dose and product price per dose) should be chosen.\nOn selection of an inhaler device, it is important that consideration is given to other aspects of asthma care that influence the effective delivery of inhaled therapy, including:\nindividual practical training in the use of the specific device monitoring of effective inhaler technique and adherence to therapy regular (i.e. no less than annual) review of inhaler needs, which may change over time with increasing age\n\n【2】 #Clinical Need and Practice\nAsthma is a chronic inflammatory disease affecting the lower airways, which manifests as reversible airway obstruction and mucosal inflammation, resulting in airway narrowing (bronchoconstriction). Children with asthma experience recurrent symptoms of cough, wheeze and breathlessness, and acute exacerbations/attacks. Symptoms can be caused by a variety of triggers principally infection, allergy, airborne chemicals, passive smoking, and exercise.\nAcute episodes may be experienced by children with any level of chronic asthma. While symptoms vary in individual cases, acute episodes may have the following characteristics: mild episodes – cough, audible wheeze, normal speech between breaths, and peak expiratory flow rate and forced expiratory volume above 75% of predicted values; severe episodes – severe distress, cyanosis (bluish lips), reduced ability to speak (often limited to only a few words between breaths), and being chair or bed bound.\nChildhood asthma is common – studies suggest that the prevalence of diagnosed childhood asthma is between 10% and 23% in England. However, not all cases are diagnosed or treated, and it is estimated that in England and Wales 12% of boys and 10% of girls aged 5–15 years are treated for asthma. These treatment rates are higher than in any other age group and in the overall population (for which the treatment rate is 7%).\nA steady rise in the diagnosis of childhood asthma is reported in England and Wales, with increases from 7% to 13% in girls and from 10% to 17% in boys aged 5–14 years between 1990 and 19\nThe goals of asthma treatment are primarily the prevention of chronic symptoms, maintenance of near normal lung function and normal activity levels, and prevention of recurrent acute episodes (which may lead to hospitalisation), in order to maximise quality of life and satisfaction with the care being provided. It is likely that currently many asthma sufferers are achieving sub-optimal control of symptoms because of inadequate or inappropriate use of preventive therapy.\nA number of approaches to managing asthma are available, including non-pharmacological strategies (e.g. allergen and air pollutant avoidance), oral pharmacological therapy (e.g. corticosteroids, leukotriene receptor antagonists), and inhaled pharmacological therapy.\nBronchodilators (ß2-agonists, antimuscarinic bronchodilators) relieve symptoms of bronchoconstriction. Short-acting ß2-agonists deliver rapid relief, with a peak effect within 20 minutes. Long-acting ß2-agonists, which act for at least 12 hours, are used in conjunction with inhaled corticosteroids to treat children with more severe chronic asthma. Most children with chronic asthma are treated with inhaled bronchodilators.\nAnti-inflammatory agents (corticosteroids, cromoglicate and related compounds) act to prevent asthma symptoms. Three corticosteroid compounds are available: budesonide, beclometasone dipropionate, and fluticasone propionate. Sodium cromoglicate and nedocromil sodium are non-steroidal alternatives. Children with moderate or severe chronic asthma usually require inhaled anti-inflammatory treatment as well as bronchodilators.\nThree main types of inhaler device are available: 'press-and-breathe' pressurised metered dose inhalers (pMDIs), breath-actuated pressurised metered dose aerosol inhalers, and dry powder inhalers (DPIs). In addition, press-and-breathe pMDIs can be used in conjunction with spacer systems, and pMDIs use either chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) or CFC-free, hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) propellants.\nOver 70 individual inhaler products (including different drugs and doses), together with at least five further spacer device attachments, are licensed in the UK for use by children aged 5–15 years. Innovation is continuing and new devices are emerging into the market. The majority of research on asthma therapy concentrates on the effect of drugs rather than that of the delivery device. Consequently there is a shortage of independent and evidence-based information for clinicians and patients choosing devices.\n\n【3】 #Press-and-breathe pMDIs\nAround 60% of childhood asthma inhaler medication is delivered by press-and-breathe pMDIs. These comprise a small plastic construction carrying a metal aerosol canister, often containing 200 doses. Both branded and generic press-and-breathe pMDIs are available. The inhaler is prepared by shaking. Users should remove the mouthpiece cap, breathe out, then take a slow deep breath through the mouth, actuating the device (i.e. pressing the canister) as inhalation begins, and then hold their breath.\nIndividuals may experience a number of problems with press-and-breathe pMDIs that can affect adherence to therapy and adequacy of delivery of drug to the lungs, and therefore effectiveness. It is estimated that at least 50% of press-and-breathe pMDI users have less than optimal technique. Problems include difficulty in co-ordinating device actuation and inhalation, oropharyngeal deposition of the drug, and, in the case of CFC devices, the 'cold freon effect', when the temperature of the propellant causes some individuals briefly to stop inhaling.\n\n【4】 #Spacer systems\nThe use of various spacer systems, which attach directly to the inhaler device, is one approach to alleviating some of the problems associated with pMDI use.\nTwo general types of spacer are available:\nDetachable chambers (small, medium or large volume): this type of spacer is attached to a press-and-breathe pMDI when required, and acts as a holding chamber for the aerosol and drug, allowing a number of breaths to be taken. Most spacers of this type incorporate a valve system, and inhalation techniques need to be taught. Five such spacers are currently available on NHS prescription.\nSmall-volume extended mouthpiece spacers: these provide increased distance between the point of aerosol release and the oropharyngeal area. They are available for use with some press-and-breathe and breath-actuated pMDIs.\nMany spacers are designed in conjunction with specific press-and-breathe pMDIs. However, some are designed to allow attachment to a wider range of press-and-breathe pMDIs, and in these cases there may be some uncertainty about their performance with different inhalers compared with those spacers designed for use with an individual inhaler.\nOther shortcomings associated with spacers are portability and inconvenience, and feelings of stigma, which children may experience with their use.\n\n【5】 #Breath-actuated pMDIs\nBreath-actuated pMDIs also deliver a pressurised aerosol metered dose of drug, but are automatically actuated when the user inhales through the mouthpiece. Automatic actuation removes the difficulty of actuation-inhalation co-ordination that is associated with press-and-breathe pMDIs. However, the sound of some devices and the different sensation of automatic actuation may hamper use in some children. Oropharyngeal deposition can be a problem in breath-actuated pMDIs. Two breath-actuated pMDIs are currently available.\n\n【6】 #Dry powder inhalers (DPIs)\nDPIs deliver the micronised drug, and generally a carrier powder, using the individual's own inspiratory flow. This is another approach to overcoming the problem of actuation–inhalation co-ordination associated with pMDIs. Many newer DPIs also incorporate approaches to counting doses used or the amount of drug remaining, which can be used to aid monitoring of adherence to treatment.\nSome children (generally younger ones) may not reliably generate inspiratory flows that are high enough for effective delivery. These problems may present difficulty during acute exacerbations, and a press-and-breathe pMDI and spacer may be required for back-up.\nThere is greater variation in the design of DPIs than in other device types. A child may find one DPI device easier to use than another, or express a preference because of the appearance of a particular device. Seven DPIs are currently available for children.\n\n【7】 #Choosing suitable devices\nThe benefit gained from inhaled therapy is a unique combination of the drug, device and the individual (i.e. physical, cognitive, psychological and lifestyle characteristics). Consequently the following factors require consideration when choosing a device.\n\n【8】 Adherence to treatment – Even where good technique is possible, children may not use their devices appropriately. Device use may be influenced by a range of factors, including convenience, ease of device use, portability, the stigma of having asthma, and personal or peer preference for a specific device. The relative importance of these factors changes as children get older and so the choice of device should be reviewed frequently.\nAvailability of drugs – Some drugs are only available in particular devices\n\n【9】 #Evidence\nThe systematic review included evidence on clinical effectiveness, ease of use, preference, compliance, and cost effectiveness.\n\n【10】 #Clinical effectiveness\nBecause of the specificity of device and drug effect, evidence for one drug in one device cannot be generalised to other drugs. Therefore, only research comparing the same drug (e.g. salbutamol vs salbutamol) at an equivalent dose level in different devices was considered. Studies including children aged 5–15 years were included in the review. Since the appraisal concerns device choice, rather than whether to treat using inhaler devices, placebo comparisons were not included. All studies included in the consideration of clinical effectiveness were randomised controlled trials (RCTs).\nEvidence in this area is generally limited in quantity and quality. Only one relevant study comparing a breath-actuated device with other devices was found, and few studies considered devices delivering cromoglicates, long-acting ß2-agonists, or drugs in combination. Many of the available studies included fewer than 50 children, and were under-powered. The review found that studies claiming to demonstrate equivalence were often unable to do so, and that some studies used inappropriate dose comparators.\nThree in vitro studies of drug delivery were identified, but these do not provide a sufficiently reliable basis for generalisation to device performance in children with asthma in clinical practice.\n\n【11】 #Delivery of bronchodilators\nTwenty-three studies in the systematic review examined different devices in the delivery of bronchodilators. Seven studies compared press-and-breathe pMDIs with and without spacers. In the main these included children, and all had fewer than 50 participants Some studies included a high proportion of adults.Three studies comparing different DPIs were included. They found no significant difference in lung function or symptoms, and all were small or included few children.\n\n【12】 #Delivery of anti-inflammatory drugs\nEight studies examined different devices for the delivery of corticosteroids. One used a filter method to compare a press-and-breathe pMDI in combination with one of two alternative spacers In addition, a filter collection study comparing a press-and-breathe pMDI plus spacer with a DPI in children aged 5–15 years reported significantly higher deposition in the DPI group, though no differences in lung function were reported. The remaining studies were of poor quality or were likely to have included few children.Two adequately powered studies compared different DPIs, though neither reported a difference in effectiveness between devices.One study compared a press-and-breathe pMDI with a breath-actuated pMDI for cromoglicate. No differences were found in lung function, but the study was under-powered.\n\n【13】 #CFC-free devices\nThe studies included in the review reported no evidence of difference in the effectiveness of devices using CFC-containing or CFC-free propellants in pMDIs. However, it is important to note that there are some reports of higher drug deposition of corticosteroids from HFA devices. Consequently it is possible that required doses may be different when transferring children from CFC to HFA inhalers.\n\n【14】 #Other influences on effectiveness\nThirty-one studies on ease of use, preference or compliance were included in the systematic review. However their quality was generally poor, and many devices have not been studied. Many of the studies did not involve direct device comparison, had fewer than 100 participants, included adults, or did not examine the actual impact of these factors on disease outcomes. Only 11 of the studies were RCTs.\nA number of studies found that good individual (verbal) instruction was the key to correct inhaler technique, and two suggested that above age 5 or 6 years, this was the case regardless of the device. Studies on ease of use, adherence and preference are, however, of questionable value as the empirical value of these factors remains uncertain. Conclusions drawn from this body of research are likely to involve 'double counting', in that the effects of ease of use and preference may also contribute to compliance.\n\n【15】 #Cost effectiveness\nNo robust cost-effectiveness or utility studies examining use of inhalers in children aged 5–15 years with asthma were identified by the systematic review.\nThere are substantial differences in the acquisition costs of inhaler devices within the same drug dose range. For instance, in the delivery of one puff of salbutamol (ß2-agonist) a day, the lowest annual inhaler costs per device type are: press-and-breathe pMDI, £3.14; breath-actuated pMDI, £10.99; and DPI, £11.53. The highest cost for a DPI delivering salbutamol at this dose is £30.42. Similarly, in the delivery of a 200ug dose of beclometasone (corticosteroid) a day, the lowest annual inhaler costs per device type are: press-and-breathe pMDI, £28.73; breath-actuated pMDI £28.73; and DPI £38.51. The highest cost for a DPI delivering beclometasone at this dose is £69.06.

Deficiency of protein as well as energy nutrients (that is carbohydrates and fats) in the diet may lead to marasmus. Marasmus typically occurs in children below the age of 1 year.\n\n【2】 #Causes\nKwashiorkor is most common in areas where there is:\n- Famine\n- Limited food supply\n- Low levels of education (when people do not understand how to eat a proper diet)\nThis disease is more common in very poor countries. It often occurs during a drought or other natural disaster, or during political unrest. These conditions are responsible for a lack of food, which leads to malnutrition. Marasmus is very rare in children in the United States. There are only isolated cases. However, one government estimate suggests that as many as 50% of elderly people in nursing homes in the United States do not get enough protein in their diet. When marasmus does occur in the United States, it is most often a sign of child abuse and severe neglect.\n\n【3】 #Symptoms\nSymptoms include:\n- Patient appears like an 'elderly man'\n- Dry and flaking/peeling skin but no changes in color - Loss of muscle mass\n- Sunken eyes\n- Protruded cheeks\n- Loss of fullness near the mouth area giving rise to 'monkey-like' facies\n- Swelling of body (edema) is generally not seen in marasmus\n- Diarrhea - Failure to gain weight and grow\n- Fatigue\n- Hair changes (change in color or texture)\n- Increased and more severe infections due to damaged immune system\n- Irritability\n- Lethargy or apathy\n- Rash (dermatitis)\n- Shock (late finding)\n\n【4】 #Diagnosis\nThe physical exam may show an enlarged liver (hepatomegaly) and general swelling. Tests may include:\n- Arterial blood gas\n- BUN\n- Complete blood count (CBC)\n- Creatinine clearance\n- Serum creatinine\n- Total protein levels\n- Urinalysis\n\n【5】 #Treatment\nGetting more calories and protein will correct marasmus, if treatment is started early enough. However, children who have had this condition will never reach their full potential for height and growth.\nTreatment depends on the severity of the condition. People who are in shock need treatment right away to restore blood volume and maintain blood pressure. Calories are given first in the form of carbohydrates, simple sugars, and fats. Proteins are started after other sources of calories have already provided energy. Vitamin and mineral supplements are essential.\nSince the person will have been without much food for a long period of time, eating can cause problems, especially if the calories are too high at first. Food must be reintroduced slowly.\nMany malnourished children will develop intolerance to milk sugar (lactose intolerance). They will need to be given supplements with the enzyme lactase so that they can tolerate milk products.\n\n【6】 #Outlook (Prognosis)\nGetting treatment early generally leads to good results. Treating marasmus in its late stages will improve the child's general health. However, the child may be left with permanent physical and mental problems. If treatment is not given or comes too late, this condition is life threatening.\n\n【7】 #Complications\nComplications may include:\n- Coma - Permanent mental and physical disability\n- Shock\n\n【8】 #When to Contact a Medical Professional\nCall your health care provider if your child has symptoms of marasmus.\n\n【9】 #Prevention\nTo prevent marasmus, make sure the diet has enough carbohydrates, fat (at least 10% of total calories), and protein (12% of total calories).\n\n【10】 #Alternative Names\nProtein malnutrition; Protein-calorie malnutrition; Malignant malnutrition", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-05-08 01:38:00", "update_time": "2024-05-08 22:09:58"}

These images provide an accurate anatomical picture that has greatly advanced health care today. Clinically, the images produced by MRI are invaluable, but the full potential of using MRI in acquiring functional, physiological, and molecular information is only beginning to be realized. The goal of this work is to further understand and develop approaches to magnetic resonance imaging to acquire information on the molecular level, a field termed molecular imaging.\nMolecular imaging refers to the study of cellular and molecular events through noninvasive investigation . Bringing molecular imaging to MRI requires generating contrast specific to information on the molecular level that is also sensitive enough to be observed at the voxel level. Gadolinium ion-based contrast agents are required to be present in relatively high concentrations, on the order of millimoles.  Targeted in vivo imaging with MRI, however, often requires contrast agent compounds to be effective at concentrations on the order of 10 μM . It is therefore desirable to obtain contrast agents in which a small number of bindings to targets will be sufficient to generate contrast. Iron oxide nanoparticles provide the possibility of detection at the single particle level . These particles, however, are at the micrometer size. Such large particles are likely to interfere with normal cellular processes limiting their application to cellular and molecular imaging. It is therefore important to devise methods for imaging small particles, on the order of nanometers in size. This is especially important for intracellular studies.\nHere we will begin by looking at contrast in MRI. The parameters described that are responsible for generating the intrinsic contrast between tissues in MRI are the same parameters affected by synthetic contrast agents. This will help to understand the mechanism of contrast agents and the reason superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) nanoparticles are an appropriate choice for molecular imaging.\n\n【2】 #Contrast in MRI\nThe principles of MRI follow from the same principle of exciting spins as found in nuclear magnetic resonance . The system of spins is excited by radiofrequency (RF) energy, followed by a period of spatial encoding and then a period of signal acquisition during which the spin system is emitting energy as it relaxes to its equilibrium state. This energy is received as the signal for the MRI image.\nT2, often called spin-spin relaxation, refers to decay time of the signal received. During signal acquisition, the effect of field inhomogeneity, mostly arising from nearby spins affecting each other, causes the coherence of the signal to be lost.\nPutting these parameters together results in the most basic signal equation:\nHere, TR is the repetition time and TE is the echo time of the imaging pulse sequence. This equation represents the effects described above. The signal (S) is proportional to spin density (M0). It is increased by a shorter T1 and decreased by a shorter T2. By choosing TR and TE carefully, images can be chosen to favor T1, T2 or spin density weighting.\n\n【3】 Since these are the basic parameters of contrast in the MR image, it is these parameters that should be altered by any potential contrast agent. The most common MR contrast agents are paramagnetic gadolinium ion complexes and superparamagnetic iron oxide particles . Gadolinium contrast agents are used primarily for their ability to shorten T1, although at high concentrations, they can have significant effects on T2 as well. Iron oxide agents, on the other hand, have less effect on T1 and are used primarily for their effect on T2. Based on equation 1.1, it can be seen that gadolinium enhanced T1 imaging would show bright pixels in locations where contrast is present, and iron oxide enhanced T2 imaging would show decreased signal where contrast agent is present. In either case, it is the contrast with adjacent pixels that is the desirable effect.\nIn practice today, these contrast agents are non-specific. They are taken up into tissues based on passive biodistribution. Oral agents are useful for picturing bowel, and organs that filter the blood such as the liver and kidneys, have high concentrations of contrast when agents are injected intravenously. In order to extend the use of contrast agents to other, specific tissues, it is necessary to develop targeted probes. Such probes have the advantage of targeting and delineating areas of specific molecular activity on an MR image. For instance, in clinical procedures, an anatomical image revealing a mass would be routinely biopsied. If, however, there were a way to deliver a contrast agent that is only activated under specific, controlled circumstances, such as the expression of a carcinogenic genotype, one could obtain an image that provides molecular, as well as anatomical information. The need for biopsy would be reduced. This example represents a great advancement in clinical diagnosis, yet it represents a relatively modest goal of the potential such research could provide.\n\n【4】 Targeted imaging applications raise the need for development of new contrast agents capable of being detected at low concentrations. Successful in vivo imaging with MRI often requires target concentrations on the order of 10 μM . In these applications, the contrast agent molecule is conjugated to the ligand which will bind the target, meaning the contrast agents must be effective at micromolar concentrations. The ability to use gadolinium for molecular imaging applications is therefore limited by its need to be present in millimolar quantities in order to cause a visible contrast.\n\n【5】 #Molecular Imaging\nMolecular imaging, in general, refers to the study of cellular and molecular events through noninvasive investigation . In MRI, molecular imaging is dependent on induced changes in proton relaxivity on the molecular and cellular level. Bringing molecular imaging to human MRI requires generating contrast on the molecular level that is not only specific, but also sensitive enough to be observed at the voxel level. MRI scanners at 3 Tesla, the current state of the art in human clinical scanning, offer submillimeter resolution Probes must be able to generate contrast by specific molecular mechanisms, yet the change in signal must be large enough to be visible on the voxel level.\nOver the last decade, biocompatible iron oxide particles have been linked to specific ligands for targeted molecular imaging applications . However, due to their relatively large size and clearance by the reticuloendothelial system (RES), there is still a lack of widespread biomedical molecular application. Imaging of macrophage activity remains the most significant application, particularly for tumor staging of the liver and lymph nodes, and several commercial products are either approved or in clinical trials. Labeling non-phagocytic cells in culture using modified particles, followed by transplantation or transfusion in living organisms, has led to an active research interest to monitor cellular biodistribution in vivo, including cell migration and trafficking. While most of these studies have been more focused on establishing techniques, further use of these approaches will be as tools to obtain deeper insights into the dynamics of in vivo cell biology and at monitoring therapies that are based on the use of stem cells and progenitors.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-05-08 01:38:00", "update_time": "2024-05-08 18:55:25"}

Micafungin exposure was dose proportional across the dose and age range studied.\n\n【4】 ## Special Populations\nMycamine does not require dose adjustment in patients with renal impairment. A single 1-hour infusion of 100 mg Mycamine was administered to 9 adult subjects with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min) and to 9 age-, gender-, and weight-matched subjects with normal renal function (creatinine clearance greater than 80 mL/min). The maximum concentration (Cmax) and AUC were not significantly altered by severe renal impairment.\nSince micafungin is highly protein bound, it is not dialyzable. Supplementary dosing should not be required following hemodialysis.\n-A single 1-hour infusion of 100 mg Mycamine was administered to 8 adult subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 7-9) and 8 age-, gender-, and weight-matched subjects with normal hepatic function. The Cmax and AUC values of micafungin were lower by approximately 22% in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment compared to normal subjects. This difference in micafungin exposure does not require dose adjustment of Mycamine in patients with moderate hepatic impairment.\nDistribution\nThe mean ± standard deviation volume of distribution of micafungin at terminal phase was 0.39 ± 0.11 L/kg body weight when determined in adult patients with esophageal candidiasis at the dose range of 50 mg to 150 mg.\nMicafungin is highly (greater than 99%) protein bound in vitro, independent of plasma concentrations over the range of 10 to 100 mcg/mL. The primary binding protein is albumin; however, micafungin, at therapeutically relevant concentrations, does not competitively displace bilirubin binding to albumin. Micafungin also binds to a lesser extent to α1-acid-glycoprotein.\nMetabolism\nIn four healthy volunteer studies, the ratio of metabolite to parent exposure (AUC) at a dose of 150 mg/day was 6% for M-1, 1% for M-2, and 6% for M-5. In patients with esophageal candidiasis, the ratio of metabolite to parent exposure (AUC) at a dose of 150 mg/day was 11% for M-1, 2% for M-2, and 12% for M\nExcretion\nThe excretion of radioactivity following a single intravenous dose of 14C-micafungin sodium for injection (25 mg) was evaluated in healthy volunteers. At 28 days after administration, mean urinary and fecal recovery of total radioactivity accounted for 82.5% (76.4% to 87.9%) of the administered dose. Fecal excretion is the major route of elimination (total radioactivity at 28 days was 71% of the administered dose).USE IN\n\n【5】 ### Pregnancy\nPregnancy Category C. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of Mycamine in pregnant women. Animal reproduction studies in rabbits showed visceral abnormalities and increased abortion at 4 times the recommended human dose. However, animal studies are not always predictive of human response. Mycamine should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\nWhen pregnant rabbits were given 4 times the recommended human dose, there were increased abortion and visceral abnormalities including abnormal lobation of the lung, levocardia, retrocaval ureter, anomalous right subclavian artery, and dilatation of the ureter .\n\n【6】 ### Nursing Mothers\nIt is not known whether micafungin is excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when Mycamine is administered to a nursing woman.\n\n【7】 ### Pediatric Use\nSafety and effectiveness in pediatric patients younger than 4 months of age have not been established.\nSafety and effectiveness of Mycamine in pediatric patients 4 months of age and older have been demonstrated based on the evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adult and pediatric patients and additional pediatric pharmacokinetic and safety data.  Two randomized, double-blind, active control studies investigated the safety and efficacy of Mycamine in both adult and pediatric patients: one for the treatment of invasive candidiasis and candidemia and the other for prophylaxis of Candida infections in patients undergoing HSCT .\n\n【8】 ### Geriatric Use\nA total of 418 subjects in clinical studies of Mycamine were 65 years of age and older, and 124 subjects were 75 years of age and older. No overall differences in safety and effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.\nThe exposure and disposition of a 50 mg Mycamine dose administered as a single 1-hour infusion to 10 healthy subjects aged 66-78 years were not significantly different from those in 10 healthy subjects aged 20-24 years. No dose adjustment is necessary for the elderly.\n\n【9】 ### Use in Patients with Renal Impairment\nMycamine does not require dose adjustment in patients with renal impairment. Supplementary dosing should not be required following hemodialysis .\n\n【10】 ### Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment\nDose adjustment of Mycamine is not required in patients with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment .\n\n【11】 ### Race and Gender\nNo dose adjustment of Mycamine is required based on gender or race. After 14 daily doses of 150 mg to healthy subjects, micafungin AUC in women was greater by approximately 23% compared with men, due to smaller body weight. No notable differences among white, black, and Hispanic subjects were seen. The micafungin AUC was greater by 19% in Japanese subjects compared to blacks, due to smaller body weight.\n\n【12】 ### Drug Abuse And Dependence\nThere has been no evidence of either psychological or physical dependence or withdrawal or rebound effects with Mycamine.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-05-08 01:38:00", "update_time": "2024-05-08 19:54:51"}

People having treatment outside this recommendation may continue without change to the funding arrangements in place for them before this guidance was published, until they and their NHS clinician consider it appropriate to stop.\nWhy the committee made these recommendations\nMany people with kidney disease may be on dialysis while they wait for a kidney transplant. This can have a substantial negative effect on health and quality of life. People can be highly sensitised usually because they have previously had a transfusion with a blood product, had a transplant or been pregnant, and they may have to wait several years for a suitable kidney. Some people on the waiting list may never have an offer of a donor kidney or may become too unwell to have a transplant. Imlifidase temporarily removes a substantial proportion of a person's antibodies, including those against HLA, so that a transplant can be done. It allows a donor kidney to be used that might otherwise not be a suitable match.\nThe best available clinical evidence is limited and short term. Studies suggest that imlifidase gives a short period of time to do a transplant for people who are highly sensitised to HLA. Using imlifidase might increase the time from a kidney being donated to the transplant taking place.\n\n【3】 The cost-effectiveness estimates are within the range that NICE usually considers an acceptable use of NHS resources. There is substantial uncertainty about the estimates, but this uncertainty needs to be balanced against the benefits of more equitable access to transplants. Also, integrating imlifidase into the existing transplant process will be challenging. So, it is recommended, but it is essential that only 1 dose per person is used, in centres with experience of treating high sensitisation to HLA. This will help to minimise the time from a kidney being donated to the transplant taking place\n\n【4】 #Information about imlifidase\n\n【5】 #Conditional marketing authorisation indication\n\n【6】 #Dosage in the marketing authorisation\nThe dosage schedule is available in the summary of product characteristics for imlifidase.\n\n【7】 The proposed list price for imlifidase is £135,000 per 11 mg vial. An average course of treatment is expected to cost £282,150 at list price.\nThe company has a commercial arrangement. This makes imlifidase available to the NHS with a discount. The size of the discount is commercial in confidenc\n\n【8】 #Committee discussion\n\n【9】 ## Renal replacement therapies while waiting for a kidney transplant can have a substantial effect on quality of life\nMany people who are waiting for a deceased donor kidney are on dialysis. This filters waste products out of the blood. Both haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis have a substantial effect on day-to-day life for someone with advanced chronic kidney disease. The patient expert explained that before both types of dialysis, the person needs to have surgery. People on dialysis have restricted fluid intake and diets, and may have very reduced energy levels. Also, people having haemodialysis need 2 or 3 sessions a week, each lasting 5 hours, so there is a substantial impact on time. They explained that it is often difficult for people on dialysis to make plans to see friends and family, or go on holidays, and that the time needed for haemodialysis can affect their ability to work full time. Long-term dialysis can also have a range of effects on physical and mental health, such as bone disease, heart disease, and a loss of hope. In some cases, people die while on the transplant waiting list. One of the patient groups highlighted that being on dialysis can feel like \"sitting and waiting and feeling like everything's on hold\". The patient expert explained that although people recognise that a kidney transplant is not without risk, and lifelong immunosuppression afterwards can have side effects (such as skin cancer risks with older regimens), a kidney transplant gives hope for a more normal life. The committee recognised that people who are on dialysis, especially for a long time while waiting for a kidney transplant, have reduced quality of life.\n\n【10】 ## People who are highly sensitised wait longer for a suitable donor kidney, and imlifidase can improve access to kidney transplantation\nSome people who need a transplant have an immunological barrier to transplantation. They have antibodies to human leukocyte antigens (HLA), which is known as being sensitised This is because this creates the opportunity of either directed-donation transplant or transplant through the UK Living Kidney Sharing Scheme. If that is not possible, then people have dialysis until a suitable deceased donor is found through the national deceased donor allocation algorithm (UK Kidney Offering Scheme). NHS Blood and Transplant data reported in 2020 that the median wait for a deceased donor kidney was about 5 years for people who are highly sensitised, although a small number of people could wait more than 7 years. This is compared with a median waiting time of 1.5 to 2 years for people who are not sensitised at all. The UK Kidney Offering Scheme algorithm changed in 2019, with the aim of increasing access to transplants in the most sensitised population. Since 2019, the number of people in this group getting transplants has increased . But the committee recognised that people who are highly sensitised still wait longer for a suitable donor kidney than those who are not. It recognised there is still an unmet need, and imlifidase offers the possibility of improving access to kidney transplantation.\n\n【11】 ## People who have waited a long time for a transplant may not be well enough to have one by the time a suitable donor is found\nWhile it is possible for a well-matched deceased donor kidney to become available for someone who is highly sensitised to HLA, it is unlikely. The likelihood of a favourable crossmatch may be measured by the calculated reaction frequency (CRF). That is, if someone waiting for a kidney had a CRF of 99%, this means 99% of the last 10,000 deceased donors would have HLA that would react with the blood serum of the person waiting for a kidney. In recent years, some centres have had success with antibody-incompatible transplants If these people do not have a suitable living donor available for a directed transplant or transplant through a kidney sharing scheme, then they have no other options but to continue waiting for a well-matched deceased donor kidney. If they wait too long, they may no longer be well enough to have a transplant.\n\n【12】 ## An intensive immunosuppression regimen is needed for some people\nImlifidase is an enzyme that breaks down a major class of human antibodies (immunoglobulin G). This includes the antibodies that a person already has against potential donor kidneys. If imlifidase is given immediately before a transplant, it can change a positive crossmatch to a negative one. This allows a brief window for a transplant to be done without rapid rejection. It is considered innovative by some clinical experts. Because the treatment has a transient effect, antibody levels in the body rise after transplant. Some people who had imlifidase in the trials also had a more intensive regimen of immunosuppression drugs after transplant than is currently used in the NHS for transplants without imlifidase. The committee was aware that some people who might have imlifidase might need more intensive immunosuppression regimens. But it was also aware of the impact staying on dialysis can have on health and quality of life. The committee concluded that some people who are highly sensitised may need more intense immunosuppression after having a transplant with imlifidase.\n\n【13】 ## The proposed population is appropriate but needs to be considered in the context of current NHS clinical practice\nThe deceased donor UK Kidney Offering Scheme was updated in 2019 . This allowed kidneys to be donated from people who had died by circulatory death, in addition to those who had died by brainstem death, to be included in the UK Kidney Offering Scheme. It also increased the priority level of people who were previously harder to find a match for, or who have waited over 7 years for a transplant.\na CRF of at least 99%\na matchability score of 10 (a measure from 1 to 10 of how difficult it is to match a person with an organ donor in the UK)\nhave been on the waiting list for a transplant for at least 2 years.The company had also included a requirement for people to have been on dialysis for at least 2 years to be eligible for imlifidase. This was to allow time to find a suitable organ using the Kidney Offering Scheme. But the ERG noted that this might exclude a small number of people who might otherwise have met the eligibility criteria. So, based on clinical feedback, the company agreed that being on dialysis should not necessarily be a requirement . The clinical experts agreed that people with a CRF of 99% to 100% who were considered unlikely to have a transplant did represent the NHS population that this technology would be most suitable for. They noted that the proportion of deceased donor kidney transplants going to people with a CRF of 100% had doubled from 2% to 4% in the first year of applying the new UK algorithm, and suggested that the change in criteria had improved the prospects for people for whom it is difficult to find a match. But there are still people who would only be able to have a transplant if imlifidase were to become available. The company stated that this group of people represented around 10% of people on the Kidney Offering Scheme waiting list. It explained that despite the recent changes to the UK allocation algorithm, there are still people who do not benefit from the scheme and so are still unlikely to have a transplant. This is because the proposed population has substantially increased wait times for transplant, and many may never have a suitable donor organ offer. Consultation feedback noted that people who are highly sensitised are still disadvantaged in the new algorithm . It suggested that access to transplantation for people who are highly sensitised could be increased by allowing antibody-incompatible transplants. This could be made more possible with imlifidase. The company stated that the major advantage of imlifidase would be greater equity of access to kidneys for transplant. The committee recognised that the availability of imlifidase would not increase the number of deceased donor kidneys available for transplant. But it acknowledged that it could change which people on the waiting list would benefit from this limited resource. The ERG noted that only a small number of people included in the company's trials met the company's proposed eligibility criteria. So, there was uncertainty about the generalisability of the clinical evidence to other people in the NHS . Clinical feedback at consultation suggested the proposed population reflected the people who would be most likely to have imlifidase. The committee concluded that the company's proposed population is appropriate but needs to be considered in the context of NHS clinical practice .\n\n【14】 ## Protocols should be developed to mitigate the impact of increased cold ischaemic time on donor kidneys when using imlifidase\nWhen a deceased donor kidney becomes available, it is allocated to an eligible person through the UK Kidney Offering Scheme. Various factors are considered to account for the suitability, urgency and need of a person who could have the donor kidney. The committee considered the impact this might have on the organ's cold ischaemic time (that is, the length of time between a kidney being removed from a donor and being transplanted). The clinical experts explained that the average cold ischaemic time varies across the transplant centres in the UK but is around 12 to 16 hours. It also varies for donations after brain stem death and for donations after circulatory death. The committee understood that going beyond a 12‑hour cold ischaemic time with kidneys after circulatory death may present a greater risk of delayed graft failure, and therefore they need to be transplanted within a shorter time window. Other factors can increase cold ischaemic time, including transporting the kidney and the number of crossmatch tests needed. The clinical experts agreed that an increased cold ischaemic time is likely to have some negative effects on transplant outcomes. But the company noted that recent data from NHS Blood and Transplant suggested that many transplants with a cold ischaemic time of more than 24 hours are still being carried out successfully. The clinical experts explained that procedures can be put in place to mitigate the impact of extended cold ischaemic time and prevent delays to transplantation. These could include pre-donation blood samples and virtual crossmatch testing. Already in NHS practice, a second person from the waiting list is lined up ready to have a transplant as a back-up, in case the first person matched cannot have the transplant. So, for imlifidase, if a negative crossmatch was not reached in time, the donor kidney could be used for someone else. The committee noted that the centres in the clinical trial were not based in the UK and might have been well placed for short cold ischaemic times, by providing high numbers of transplants and donors close by. The NHS England commissioning lead explained that a clinically led national multidisciplinary team would be needed to develop the pathways and protocols for using imlifidase if it was recommended. The committee agreed that these protocols could allow people needing imlifidase to be treated in a specialist centre with experience of transplantation in people who are highly sensitised. It concluded that protocols should be developed in a small number of specialist centres to mitigate the impact of increased cold ischaemic time on donor kidneys when using imlifidase.\n\n【15】 ## A limit of 1 imlifidase infusion should be used for people who are highly sensitised\nAdding a second imlifidase infusion could potentially increase the cold ischaemic time because an additional crossmatch test would be needed. Clinical feedback at consultation suggested that adding a second dose could add an extra 8 to 10 hours to the transplant process. Only a small number of people in the clinical trials who had imlifidase needed a second imlifidase infusion (the exact proportions are confidential). The clinical experts advised that 1 infusion would be sufficient in most situations. The committee agreed that giving only 1 infusion of imlifidase would allow for safe transplantation within acceptable cold ischaemic time thresholds. The committee accepted that this would be a pragmatic option given the challenges of the increased cold ischaemic time, and would allow for most people who are highly sensitised to have imlifidase. It concluded that there should be a limit of only 1 imlifidase infusion for people who are highly sensitised.\n\n【16】 ## Kidneys are a scarce resource, but decisions should consider equity of access for people who are highly sensitised\nPrinciple 7 of the principles that guide the development of NICE guidance and standards states that recommendations should be based on population benefits and value for money' The committee understood that any donor kidney used with imlifidase could have been used for someone else who is likely to incur lower costs, and have better outcomes and equal related savings from avoiding dialysis. The clinical experts had a wide range of views on which costs and benefits should be included. The company felt a utilitarian analysis at the population level would not capture the benefit of increased equity of access to transplants. It considered that allocation of deceased donor kidneys already relies on a trade-off between equitable access and providing best quality matching. The committee recognised the equity issues of people who are highly sensitised and agreed that these should be taken into account. The company had not provided much evidence of the differences in outcomes for people who are highly sensitised who had imlifidase, compared with those who are not highly sensitised and who would no longer get a transplant. The committee recognised these populations were different. But it was aware that both groups would be competing for the same resource. The company had not explored the potential consequences of this. The committee noted that principle 9 of the principles that guide the development of NICE guidance and standards aims to reduce health inequalities, which emphasises that NICE guidance should support strategies that improve population health as a whole. It considered that people who would be eligible for imlifidase are likely to have been on the waiting list for a long time and they would likely still be disadvantaged using the new Kidney Offering Scheme algorithm. The committee concluded that kidneys are a scarce resource, but decisions should consider opportunity costs as well as equity of access for people who are highly sensitised.\n\n【17】 ## The outcome data is short term but is the best data available\nEvidence for the clinical effectiveness of imlifidase originally came from 4 non-UK based, uncontrolled, open-label studies. The primary outcomes reported on safety and ability to achieve a crossmatch conversion after treatment with imlifidase. For this reason, they had short follow-up times that ranged between 64 days and 180 days. This meant that longer-term outcomes to assess the success of transplant were not estimated. The clinical experts agreed that the trial outcomes were too short for this clinical context (with potential graft loss at 5, 10 and 15 years). The company had acknowledged that longer-term data was needed and provided further clinical evidence for imlifidase from the trials originally included. The ERG had requested the company provide clinical evidence for 3 populations. These included:\nthe company's newly defined patient population\nthe most relevant patient population (defined by the company as people who are 'unlikely' to have a transplant, as informed by US-based criteria , receipt of a kidney from a deceased donor, and a calculated panel-reactive antibodies score of at least 99.9%) in the absence of evidence for the new population the sample of people in the company's included clinical trials who had imlifidase.The ERG considered that the quality of data beyond the original trials was limited. Very few people in the new eligible patient population for imlifidase were enrolled in the follow-up study. The company considers the actual number to be commercial in confidence so it cannot be reported here. There were high levels of withdrawals in the sample. Data was only available for 46% of people who had a calculated panel-reactive antibody score (the estimated proportion of deceased donors who are not compatible with a crossmatch) of 99.9% and had a deceased donor transplant at the final 3‑year follow up. The ERG stated that this meant data had been provided up to 3 years rather than a follow-up period based upon a minimum or median time period, which is usual in reporting clinical trial data. The company clarified that the data represented the longest-term available clinical data to date. Although the sample size was small, it reflected the relatively small group of people who would be eligible for imlifidase. The company's longer-term outcome data included rates of transplant rejection, median graft survival and overall survival The committee considered that although this represented the best available evidence for imlifidase, it was still limited. The ERG stated that the company's new evidence related to an initial 6 months after transplant. Clinical opinion sought by the ERG suggested that longer-term data beyond 3 years would be needed to better determine clinical outcomes, especially on graft survival and health-related quality of life, for people who have a transplant with imlifidase. The company confirmed it has submitted a protocol for a phase 3, controlled, non-randomised, open-label study. Nevertheless, the 3‑year outcomes are at least as good as those in antibody-incompatible live donor transplants in the UK. The company stated that its 3‑year follow-up data provided the longest-term clinical data for highly sensitised people needing kidney transplants. The committee concluded that although there was a lack of medium or long-term outcome data, this provided the best currently available data.\n\n【18】 ## Some antibody-mediated rejection is to be expected in people who are highly sensitised\nIn the company's model, antibody-mediated rejection had been captured using data from its clinical trials. There was a high rate of antibody-mediated rejection (40%) in the company's original clinical data. There was no comparator arm in the trials nor a matched population. So, it was also not clear whether the 40% antibody-mediated rejection was a consequence of a very unwell population in the imlifidase trials, or a consequence of people having had imlifidase in the trials. Clinical experts explained that in clinical practice they would normally expect only 10% of people to have antibody-mediated rejection after an average transplant, based on UK experience. The committee noted that the antibody-mediated rejection rates were still high in the company's newly defined population. The exact rates cannot be reported because they are commercial in confidence. The clinical experts explained that it is difficult to establish exact rates because reasons will vary depending on individual characteristics. But a 30% to 50% antibody-mediated rejection rate for people who are highly sensitised in the first month after transplant would be plausible. At consultation, the company stated the antibody-mediated reaction rates in its trials were in line with what is expected in clinical practice for HLA-incompatible kidney transplants. In the company's trial data, no antibody-mediated rejection events were reported after the first year after transplant. So, the company had only included the events and related costs of antibody-mediated rejection events in the first 2 cycles of its model. The committee was concerned that antibody-mediated rejection had not been fully accounted for in the company's model. The model also did not differentiate between a graft needing intensive immunosuppression therapy and one that was more successful. Antibody-mediated rejection can be chronic and difficult to treat, with changes in immunosuppression regimens, biopsies and limited graft survival. Feedback at consultation clarified that an antibody-mediated rejection rate of 40% was consistent with HLA antibody-incompatible transplantation. The committee concluded that some antibody-mediated rejection is to be expected in people who are highly sensitised, but their quality of life will be improved while the transplant is working.\n\n【19】 ## A small number of people would not have dialysis before having a transplant with imlifidase\nIn its revised model, the company used NHS Blood and Transplant data to estimate the proportion of people who were not having imlifidase who had dialysis. It originally adjusted the proportions so that everyone would have had dialysis for at least 2 years. The ERG agreed that NHS Blood and Transplant data was an appropriate source to inform this distribution, but it did not agree that everyone would be having dialysis. Based on clinical opinion, it considered that there may be a small number of people who could otherwise meet the eligibility criteria but might not be able to have imlifidase if it assumed everyone had to have had dialysis for at least 2 years. The ERG therefore assumed that 5% of people in its base case would not have dialysis before imlifidase. The company later agreed that people who had not previously had dialysis would also be eligible for imlifidase . It accepted that being on dialysis should not be a requirement but considered that a 5% proportion was too high. Based on clinical feedback it suggested it was unlikely that people who did not have dialysis would stay on the kidney waiting list for longer than 6 months. The committee recognised that there was some uncertainty around applying the estimate. But it concluded that some people would not be having dialysis before having a transplant with imlifidase.\n\n【20】 ## Not everyone who has imlifidase treatment goes on to have a kidney transplant, but the exact proportion is uncertain\nThe company's original submission assumed that 100% of people who had imlifidase would go on to have a kidney transplant. However, this was not the case in its clinical trials. For its base case, the ERG used the trial data from everyone who had imlifidase. Two out of 54 people did not get the full dose of imlifidase before transplant, so 96.3% had a transplant in the imlifidase arm of the model. The ERG also considered a scenario taking into account the 1 person (out of 52) who did not have a negative flow cytometry crossmatch (the outcome of the trial) but who had a negative virtual crossmatch after imlifidase and had a transplant anyway. In the ERG's scenario, the proportion of people having a transplant in the imlifidase arm was informed by those who had a full dose, multiplied by those who had a negative crossmatch. So, 94.4% had a transplant in the imlifidase arm in this scenario. The committee considered both the ERG base case and scenario plausible and took these into account for decision making. The company updated its base case in line with the ERG preference that 96.3% of people having imlifidase will have a transplant after treatment. The committee accepted this change but recognised that there was still some uncertainty around the appropriate value, based on the small number of people there is data for. It concluded that not everyone who has imlifidase goes on to have a kidney transplant, but the exact proportion is uncertain.\n\n【21】 ## Graft survival projections from iBox are highly uncertain so a hazard ratio should be applied to account for this\nTo extrapolate 6 months of post-transplant data from its trials, the company used the iBox predictive model for kidney graft survival. This was developed using data from a general transplant population in France, rather than a population consisting only of people who are highly sensitised. The iBox model was run with the company's trial data based on its original target population and using a Weibull distribution to extrapolate this to project long-term graft survival with imlifidase. Although the ERG considered iBox to be a high-quality predictive model, it was aware that iBox is a proprietary model that is not owned by the company. It had been unable to check how various factors were weighted, and the statistical power is unknown. The committee had originally considered the iBox projection and extrapolation to be too optimistic. It was concerned that the projection of trial data done through the iBox model was not a good long-term fit. This was because the 10‑year graft survival rates looked similar but seemed to improve for the company's highly sensitised population in relative terms at 20 years. This would suggest that people who are highly sensitised do relatively better over time, or the iBox general population (including people who are not highly sensitised) does relatively worse over time. This is implausible without evidence to support it. The committee considered that:\nOver longer time horizons, graft survival could be quite different between a general transplant population and the highly sensitised target population. So, it may not be appropriate to use the predictions from iBox (which was developed based on a general transplant population) and to apply them to a different population.\nThere is a high antibody-mediated rejection rate in the company's target population in the trials , with some people having chronic antibody-mediated rejection after imlifidase. Therefore, it could be reasonable to assume that graft survival is worse in people who are highly sensitised, and that these people may eventually need dialysis after transplant or need another transplant.\nIf graft survival after imlifidase in clinical practice for people who are highly sensitised was worse than the modelled extrapolation of graft survival from the trial, then more people than modelled would start dialysis more quickly after transplant. This would mean there would be no further dialysis cost savings for them, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) would increase. Graft survival could be related to how well immunosuppressant regimens are adhered to, which is not captured by iBox. The company later revised its graft survival extrapolations using its 3‑year follow-up data  to inform graft loss, extrapolated with an exponential distribution. It suggested that this data showed graft survival rates were higher than the iBox prediction at 3 years. The ERG noted that the company's updated analysis used data from the company-defined most relevant population rather than the newly defined population . But it did not think this assumption was reasonable. It considered that the trial data was still too immature to provide good estimates of graft survival. This was because data from only 6 people in the company's updated clinical analysis was informing the extrapolation over a lifetime horizon. So, it applied a hazard ratio of 0.90. This is because clinical feedback had suggested graft survival in people having imlifidase may not be as successful as in people who are not sensitised. The clinical experts explained that antibody-mediated rejection was not easy to predict because it is influenced by lots of factors, but applying a hazard ratio was appropriate. The committee agreed with this. At consultation, the company clarified that it still considered its 3‑year follow-up data was the most appropriate source to inform graft survival. But it provided a scenario using iBox and long-term graft survival estimates from 2 additional data sources as validation. This data showed that graft survival estimates were higher than those from iBox. So, the company considered it would not be appropriate to apply a hazard ratio to the iBox extrapolation. The ERG did not consider that the data sources used as validation by the company appropriately reflected the groups of people that would be eligible for imlifidase. It maintained its position that applying a hazard ratio of 0.90 was appropriate. The committee concluded that graft survival predictions were highly uncertain, so a hazard ratio should be applied to account for this.\n\n【22】 ## Extrapolations for overall survival with a functioning graft should be taken from the 'unlikely to be transplanted' population\nTo estimate overall survival in people who had a functioning graft, the company base case extrapolated overall survival from all people who had imlifidase and a transplant (the 'all imlifidase' population) in the company trials. The company also provided a scenario analysis using data from the 'unlikely to have a transplant' population in its trials. Although the ERG considered using the 'all imlifidase' group reasonable, it considered it to make the cost-effectiveness results highly uncertain. The ERG noted the overall survival data was too uncertain to produce reasonable long-term estimates to be used for modelling a lifetime horizon in the population considered for this evaluation. The ERG considered that, in the absence of better data, either extrapolation using the 'all imlifidase' or the 'unlikely to be transplanted' data could be reasonably used to inform overall survival with a functioning graft. The ERG explored using the 'unlikely to be transplanted' overall survival data in a scenario analysis. The committee noted this substantially increased the ICER. It considered the 'unlikely to be transplanted' population to be more appropriate to extrapolate overall survival with a functioning graft. This would be the population that would be most likely to have imlifidase in clinical practice . It concluded the extrapolations for overall survival with a functioning graft should be taken from the 'unlikely to be transplanted' population.\n\n【23】 ## The most plausible cost-effectiveness estimates are lower than £30,000 per QALY gained\nNICE's guide to the methods of technology appraisal notes that above a most plausible ICER of £20,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained, judgements about the acceptability of a technology as an effective use of NHS resources will take into account the degree of certainty around the ICER. The committee will be more cautious about recommending a technology if it is less certain about the ICERs presented. The exact ICERs are confidential, but the committee preferred the ERG's assumptions; in the ERG's base case:\n% of people would not have dialysis before having imlifidase treatment predictions for graft survival were based on iBox with a 0.90 hazard ratio the number of crossmatch tests was set to 2.4.When individual assumptions were varied, some scenarios increased the ICER. The committee considered several assumptions to be plausible that would affect the ICER:\nPotentially no lower dialysis costs overall because of displacement of donor kidneys away from people who then have to stay on or start dialysis . Correcting this would increase the ICER.\nUsing data from the population who are unlikely to have a transplant would increase the ICER.The committee considered it was more plausible for the data informing overall survival with a functioning graft to be drawn from the 'unlikely to be transplanted' population in the company's clinical trials, because this would better reflect the relevant population in clinical practice . It also recognised that there was substantial uncertainty surrounding the ICERs, and that if kidneys were used by less-sensitised populations this might lead to greater QALYs overall. But the committee considered that it needed to consider these points in the context of addressing equity of access issues . Taking each of these issues into consideration, the committee concluded that the most plausible cost-effectiveness estimate would have to be less than £30,000 per QALY gained.\n\n【24】 ## People with protected characteristics have an increased chance of becoming highly sensitised\n\n【25】 ## Imlifidase could provide a step-change in treatment, but implementation should be done using robust NHS systems\nThe committee considered whether imlifidase was innovative. It considered that imlifidase has the potential to provide a step-change to current treatment. But it was mindful of ensuring all costs and benefits were captured. The company had said that introducing imlifidase could allow people who would previously have been unlikely to get a transplant to go on to have a successful transplant, thereby improving equity of access for certain groups . For this reason, the company suggested that imlifidase was innovative because it provided substantial benefits that may not be captured by measuring health gains directly. The committee agreed that imlifidase is a novel treatment because of its mechanism of action and that it could provide a brief window for a transplant to happen without rapid rejection. But it noted the challenges of introducing the technology, relating to increased cold ischaemic times and the issues around factoring in a second imlifidase infusion if it was needed . The committee acknowledged that these factors must be taken into account in understanding whether a technology provides a step-change in treatment. It considered that implementation should be carefully considered. It was guided by the clinical experts that it was important to limit the number of centres providing imlifidase to minimise the impact on cold ischaemic time . It considered that protocols were needed to support this when using imlifidase. The committee concluded that imlifidase could provide a step-change in treatment but that to allow this, implementation should be done using robust NHS systems.\n\n【26】 ## A managed access agreement is not appropriate\nThe committee considered whether a managed access agreement would be appropriate. It considered that managed access is not appropriate to explore uncertainty around patient eligibility or the treatment pathway. It noted that a principle of managed access is that the entire eligible population should have access to treatment. It also noted that there are ethical issues with making a managed access recommendation when there are a finite number of donor kidneys. The committee considered it would be unlikely that a managed access recommendation for imlifidase aligned with the principles of resolving uncertainty through data collection, and considered whether the whole patient population could get access. It considered that the ongoing studies are unlikely to provide meaningful additional data for decision making. Collecting additional data in clinical practice would have ethical implications, which could add extra time to access to treatment. It concluded that a managed access agreement is not appropriate.\n\n【27】 ## Imlifidase is recommended, provided a maximum of 1 dose is given in a specialist centre with experience of treating high sensitisation to HLA\nThe conditional marketing authorisation specifies that imlifidase should be reserved for people unlikely to have a transplant under the available kidney allocation system, including prioritisation programmes for people who are highly sensitised. The committee understood that it can be very difficult for some people who are highly sensitised to have an appropriately matched kidney transplant. It recognised that the changes to the UK Kidney Offering Scheme in 2019 had improved access to transplants for people who are highly sensitised, but that there is still an unmet need for this population. The committee preferred the ICERs based on the ERG analyses over the company's analysis. But these were also associated with a high level of uncertainty related to integration into the existing treatment pathway and long-term clinical effectiveness. It considered that kidneys are a scarce resource that need to be allocated fairly. The committee recalled that cold ischaemic time could be mitigated by allowing only 1 dose of imlifidase . Protocols would need to be developed to allow imlifidase to be used in a small number of specialist centres with experience of transplantation in people who are highly sensitised . The committee recognised that the company had attempted to address the uncertainties in its cost-effectiveness analyses. It recognised that imlifidase could help improve equity of access to kidneys for people who are highly sensitised . It noted the protocols that would need to be developed by the NHS when using imlifidase would be clinically led, and should take into account the following criteria:\na CRF of at least 99%\na matchability score of\nhaving been on the waiting list for a transplant for at least 2 years\nmeasures to minimise cold ischaemic time that would only be given in a specialist centre with experience of treating high sensitisation to HLA.The committee therefore recommended imlifidase provided that a maximum of 1 dose is given, and only in a specialist centre with experience of treating high sensitisation to HLA.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": "语义不完整#23#23#% of people would not前面缺少内容\n语义不完整#27#27#a matchability score of后面缺少内容", "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-05-08 01:38:00", "update_time": "2024-05-08 19:32:17"}

From the urinary excretion quotient of orally and intravenously administered tritium-labelled ergoloid mesylates the absorption of ergoloid was calculated to be 25%.\n- Following oral administration, peak levels of 0.5 ngEq/mL/mg were achieved within 1.5–3 hr. Bioavailability studies with the specific radioimmunoassay confirm that ergoloid is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, with mean peak levels of 0.05–0.13 ng/mL/mg (with extremes of 0.03 and 0.18 ng/mL/mg) achieved within 0.6–1.3 hr (with extremes of 0.4 and 2.8 hr). The finding of lower peak levels of ergoloid compared to the total drug-metabolite composite is consistent with a considerable first pass liver metabolism, with less than 50% of the therapeutic moiety reaching the systemic circulation. The elimination of radioactivity, representing ergoloid plus metabolites bearing the radiolabel, was biphasic with half-lives of 4 and 13 hr. The mean half-life of unchanged ergoloid in plasma is about 2.6–5.1 hr; after 3 half-lives ergoloid plasma levels are less than 10% of radioactivity levels, and by 24 hr no ergoloid is detectable.\n- Bioequivalence studies were performed comparing ergoloid mesylates oral tablets (administered orally) with ergoloid mesylates sublingual tablets (administered sublingually). The oral tablet and sublingual tablet were shown to be bioequivalent.\n\n【31】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\nThere is limited information regarding Nonclinical Toxicology of Dihydroergocristine in the drug label.\n\n【32】 #Clinical Studies\nThere is limited information regarding Clinical Studies of Dihydroergocristine in the drug label.\n\n【33】 #How Supplied\n- Ergoloid mesylates tablets, USP (oral) 1 mg are white, round, unscored, debossed MP\n\n【34】 ## Storage\nStore at 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F)\n\n【35】 #Patient Counseling Information\nThere is limited information regarding Patient Counseling Information of Dihydroergocristine in the drug label.\n\n【36】 #Precautions with Alcohol\n- Alcohol-Dihydroergocristine interaction has not been established.

Common adverse reactions include abdominal pain.\n\n【2】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Adult)\n- Azithromycin for injection is indicated for the treatment of patients with infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms in the conditions listed below.\n- Community-acquired pneumonia due to Chlamydia pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Legionella pneumophila, Moraxella catarrhalis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, or Streptococcus pneumoniae in patients who require initial intravenous therapy.\n- Pelvic inflammatory disease due to Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, or Mycoplasma hominis in patients who require initial intravenous therapy. If anaerobic microorganisms are suspected of contributing to the infection, an antimicrobial agent with anaerobic activity should be administered in combination with azithromycin.\n- Azithromycin for injection should be followed by azithromycin by the oral route as required.\n- Appropriate culture and susceptibility tests should be performed before treatment to determine the causative microorganism and its susceptibility to azithromycin. - Therapy with azithromycin may be initiated before results of these tests are known; once the results become available, antimicrobial therapy should be adjusted accordingly.\n- To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of azithromycin and other antibacterial drugs, azithromycin should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.\n- The infusate concentration and rate of infusion for azithromycin for injection should be either 1 mg/mL over 3 hours or 2 mg/mL over 1 hour.\n- Preparation of the Solution for Intravenous Administration is as Follows:\n- Prepare the initial solution of azithromycin for injection by adding 4.8 mL of Sterile Water For Injection to the 500 mg vial and shaking the vial until all of the drug is dissolved. Since azithromycin for injection is supplied under vacuum, it is recommended that a standard 5 mL (non-automated) syringe be used to ensure that the exact amount of 4.8 mL of Sterile Water is dispensed. Each mL of reconstituted solution contains 100 mg azithromycin. Reconstituted solution is stable for 24 hours when stored below 25°C or 77°F.\n- Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter prior to administration. If particulate matter is evident in reconstituted fluids, the drug solution should be discarded.\n- Dilute This Solution Further Prior to Administration as Instructed Below.\n- Normal Saline (0.9% sodium chloride)\n- 5% Dextrose in Water\n- Lactated Ringer’s Solution\n- Normosol-M in 5% Dextrose\n\n【3】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Azithromycin (injection) in adult patients.\n\n【4】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Azithromycin (injection) in adult patients.\n\n【5】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Pediatric)\nThere is limited information regarding FDA-Labeled Use of Azithromycin (injection) in pediatric patients.\n\n【6】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Azithromycin (injection) in pediatric patients.\n\n【7】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Azithromycin (injection) in pediatric patients.\n\n【8】 #Contraindications\n- Azithromycin for injection is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to azithromycin, erythromycin, or any macrolide antibiotic.\n\n【9】 - Serious allergic reactions, including angioedema, anaphylaxis, and dermatologic reactions including Stevens Johnson Syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported rarely in patients on azithromycin therapy. Although rare, fatalities have been reported. Despite initially successful symptomatic treatment of the allergic symptoms, when symptomatic therapy was discontinued, the allergic symptoms recurred soon thereafter in some patients without further azithromycin exposure. These patients required prolonged periods of observation and symptomatic treatment. The relationship of these episodes to the long tissue half-life of azithromycin and subsequent prolonged exposure to antigen is unknown at present.\n- If an allergic reaction occurs, the drug should be discontinued and appropriate therapy should be instituted. Physicians should be aware that reappearance of the allergic symptoms may occur when symptomatic therapy is discontinued.\n- Pseudomembranous colitis has been reported with nearly all antibacterial agents and may range in severity from mild to life-threatening. Therefore, it is important to consider this diagnosis in patients who present with diarrhea subsequent to the administration of antibacterial agents.\n- Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon and may permit overgrowth of clostridia. Studies indicate that a toxin produced by Clostridium difficile is a primary cause of \"antibiotic-associated colitis.\"\n- After the diagnosis of pseudomembranous colitis has been established, therapeutic measures should be initiated. Mild cases of pseudomembranous colitis usually respond to discontinuation of the drug alone. In moderate to severe cases, consideration should be given to management with fluids and electrolytes, protein supplementation, and treatment with an antibacterial drug clinically effective against Clostridium difficile colitis.\n\n【10】 ## Clinical Trials Experience\n- In clinical trials of intravenous azithromycin for community-acquired pneumonia, in which 2-5 I.V. doses were given, most of the reported side effects were mild to moderate in severity and were reversible upon discontinuation of the drug. The majority of patients in these trials had one or more comorbid diseases and were receiving concomitant medications. Approximately 1.2% of the patients discontinued intravenous azithromycin therapy, and a total of 2.4% discontinued azithromycin therapy by either the intravenous or oral route because of clinical or laboratory side effects.\n- In clinical trials conducted in patients with pelvic inflammatory disease, in which 1-2 I.V. doses were given, 2% of women who received monotherapy with azithromycin and 4% who received azithromycin plus metronidazole discontinued therapy due to clinical side effects.\n- Clinical side effects leading to discontinuations from these studies were most commonly gastrointestinal (abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), and rashes; laboratory side effects leading to discontinuation were increases in transaminase levels and/or alkaline phosphatase levels.\n- Overall, the most common side effects associated with treatment in adult patients who received I.V./P.O. azithromycin in studies of community-acquired pneumonia were related to the gastrointestinal system with diarrhea/loose stools (4.3%), nausea (3.9%), abdominal pain (2.7%), and vomiting (1.4%) being the most frequently reported. Approximately 12% of patients experienced a side effect related to the intravenous infusion; most common were pain at the injection site (6.5%) and local inflammation (3.1%).\n- No other side effects occurred in patients on the multiple dose I.V./P.O. regimen of azithromycin in these studies with a frequency greater than 1%.\n- Side effects that occurred with a frequency of 1% or less included the following:\n- Gastrointestinal:\n- Dyspepsia, flatulence, mucositis, oral moniliasis, and gastritis - Nervous System:\n- Headache, somnolence\n- Allergic:\n- Bronchospasm\n- Special Senses:\n- Taste perversion.\n\n【11】 ## Postmarketing Experience\n- Adverse events reported with orally administered azithromycin during the post-marketing period in adult and/or pediatric patients for which a causal relationship could not be established include:\n- Allergic:\n- Arthralgia, edema, urticaria, angioedema - Cardiovascular:\n- Arrhythmias including ventricular tachycardia, hypotension. There have been rare reports of QT prolongation and torsades de pointes.\n- Gastrointestinal:\n- General:\n- Asthenia, paresthesia, fatigue, malaise and anaphylaxis (rarely fatal)\n- Interstitial nephritis and acute renal failure and vaginitis - Hematopoietic:\n- Thrombocytopenia - Liver/Biliary:\n- Nervous System:\n- Convulsions, dizziness/vertigo, headache, somnolence, hyperactivity, nervousness, agitation and syncope.\n- Psychiatric:\n- Aggressive reaction and anxiety.\n- Skin/Appendages:\n- Pruritus, rarely serious skin reactions including erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis.\n- Special Senses:\n- Hearing disturbances including hearing loss, deafness and/or tinnitus, rare reports of taste perversion\n- Laboratory Abnormalities:\n- Significant abnormalities (irrespective of drug relationship) occurring during the clinical trials were reported as follows:\n- With an incidence of 4-6%, elevated ALT (SGPT), AST (SGOT), creatinine\n- With an incidence of less than 1%, leukopenia, neutropenia, decreased platelet count, and elevated serum alkaline phosphatase.\n- When follow-up was provided, changes in laboratory tests appeared to be reversible.\n- In multiple-dose clinical trials involving more than 750 patients treated with azithromycin (I.V./P.O.), less than 2% of patients discontinued azithromycin therapy because of treatment-related liver enzyme abnormalities.\n\n【12】 #Drug Interactions\n- Aluminum- and magnesium-containing antacids reduce the peak serum levels (rate) but not the AUC (extent) of orally administered azithromycin.\n- Administration of cimetidine (800 mg) two hours prior to orally administered azithromycin had no effect on azithromycin absorption.\n- Azithromycin given by the oral route did not affect the plasma levels or pharmacokinetics of theophylline administered as a single intravenous dose. The effect of azithromycin on the plasma levels or pharmacokinetics of theophylline administered in multiple doses resulting in therapeutic steady-state levels of theophylline is not known. However, concurrent use of macrolides and theophylline has been associated with increases in the serum concentrations of theophylline. Therefore, until further data are available, prudent medical practice dictates careful monitoring of plasma theophylline levels in patients receiving azithromycin and theophylline concomitantly.\n- The following drug interactions have not been reported in clinical trials with azithromycin; however, no specific drug interaction studies have been performed to evaluate potential drug-drug interaction. Nonetheless, they have been observed with macrolide products. Until further data are developed regarding drug interactions when azithromycin and these drugs are used concomitantly, careful monitoring of patients is advised:\n- Digoxin - elevated digoxin levels.\n- Ergotamine or dihydroergotamine - acute ergot toxicity characterized by severe peripheral vasospasm and dysesthesia.\n- Triazolam - Increased pharmacologic effect of triazolam by decreasing the clearance of triazolam.\n- Drugs metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system – elevations of serum carbamazepine, terfenadine, cyclosporine, hexobarbital, and phenytoin levels.\n\n【13】 ### Pregnancy\nPregnancy Category (FDA): B\n- Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and mice at doses up to moderately maternally toxic dose levels (i.e. 200 mg/kg/day by the oral route). These doses, based on a mg/m2 basis, are estimated to be 4 and 2 times, respectively, the human daily dose of 500 mg by the oral route. In the animal studies, no evidence of harm to the fetus due to azithromycin was found. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, azithromycin should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.\n- Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) Pregnancy Category\nThere is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Azithromycin (injection) in women who are pregnant.\n\n【14】 ### Labor and Delivery\nThere is no FDA guidance on use of Azithromycin (injection) during labor and delivery.\n\n【15】 ### Nursing Mothers\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Azithromycin (injection) with respect to nursing mothers.\n\n【16】 ### Pediatric Use\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Azithromycin (injection) with respect to pediatric patients.\n\n【17】 ### Geriatic Use\n- Pharmacokinetic studies with intravenous azithromycin have not been performed in older volunteers. Pharmacokinetics of azithromycin following oral administration in older volunteers (65-85 years old) were similar to those in younger volunteers (18-40 years old) for the 5-day therapeutic regimen.\n- In multiple-dose clinical trials of intravenous azithromycin in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, 45% of patients (188/414) were at least 65 years of age and 22% of patients (91/414) were at least 75 years of age. No overall differences in safety were observed between these subjects and younger subjects in terms of adverse events, laboratory abnormalities, and discontinuations. Similar decreases in clinical response were noted in azithromycin- and comparator-treated patients with increasing age.\n- Azithromycin for injection contains 114 mg (4.96 mEq) of sodium per vial. At the usual recommended doses, patients would receive 114 mg (4.96 mEq) of sodium. The geriatric population may respond with a blunted natriuresis to salt loading. The total sodium content from dietary and non-dietary sources may be clinically important with regard to such diseases as congestive heart failure.\n\n【18】 ### Gender\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Azithromycin (injection) with respect to specific gender populations.\n\n【19】 ### Race\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Azithromycin (injection) with respect to specific racial populations.\n\n【20】 ### Renal Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Azithromycin (injection) in patients with renal impairment.\n\n【21】 ### Hepatic Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Azithromycin (injection) in patients with hepatic impairment.\n\n【22】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Azithromycin (injection) in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n\n【23】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\nThere is no FDA guidance one the use of Azithromycin (injection) in patients who are immunocompromised.\n\n【24】 ### Administration\n- Intravenous\n\n【25】 ### Monitoring\nThere is limited information regarding Monitoring of Azithromycin (injection) in the drug label.\n\n【26】 #IV Compatibility\nThere is limited information regarding IV Compatibility of Azithromycin (injection) in the drug label.\n\n【27】 #Overdosage\nThere is limited information regarding Chronic Overdose of Azithromycin (injection) in the drug label.\n\n【28】 ## Mechanism of Action\n- Azithromycin acts by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible microorganisms and, thus, interfering with microbial protein synthesis. Nucleic acid synthesis is not affected.\n- Azithromycin concentrates in phagocytes and fibroblasts as demonstrated by in vitro incubation techniques. Using such methodology, the ratio of intracellular to extra-cellular concentration was >30 after one hour incubation. In vivo studies suggest that concentration in phagocytes may contribute to drug distribution to inflamed tissues.\n\n【29】 ## Structure\n- Azithromycin for injection contains the active ingredient azithromycin, an azalide, a subclass of macrolide antibiotics, for intravenous injection. Azithromycin has the chemical name (2R,3S,4R,5R,8R,10R,11R,12S,13S,14R)-13--2-ethyl-3,4,10-trihydroxy-3,5,6,8,10,12,14-heptamethyl-11-3,4,6-trideoxy-3-(dimethylamino)-β-D-xylo-hexopyranosyloxy-1-oxa-6-azacyclopentadecan-15-one. Azithromycin is derived from erythromycin; however, it differs chemically from erythromycin in that a methyl-substituted nitrogen atom is incorporated into the lactone ring. Its molecular formula is C38H72N2O12, and its molecular weight is 749.00. Azithromycin has the following structural formula.\n\n【30】 ## Pharmacodynamics\nThere is limited information regarding Pharmacodynamics of Azithromycin (injection) in the drug label.\n\n【31】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n- In patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia receiving single daily one-hour intravenous infusions for 2 to 5 days of 500 mg azithromycin at a concentration of 2 mg/mL, the mean Cmax ± S.D. achieved was 3.63 ± 1.60 mcg/mL, while the 24-hour trough level was 0.20 ± 0.15 mcg/mL, and the AUC24 was 9.60 ± 4.80 mcg·h/mL.\n- The mean Cmax, 24-hour trough and AUC24 values were 1.14 ± 0.14 mcg/mL, 0.18 ± 0.02 mcg/mL, and 8.03 ±0.86 mcg·h/mL, respectively, in normal volunteers receiving a 3-hour intravenous infusion of 500 mg azithromycin at a concentration of 1 mg/mL. Similar pharmacokinetic values were obtained in patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia that received the same 3-hour dosage regimen for 2-5 days.\n- The average CLt and Vd values were 10.18 mL/min/kg and 33.3 L/kg, respectively, in 18 normal volunteers receiving 1000 to 4000-mg doses given as 1 mg/mL over 2 hours.\n- Comparison of the plasma pharmacokinetic parameters following the 1st and 5th daily doses of 500 mg intravenous azithromycin showed only an 8% increase in Cmax but a 61% increase in AUC24 reflecting a threefold rise in C24 trough levels.\n- Following single oral doses of 500 mg azithromycin to 12 healthy volunteers, Cmax, trough level, and AUC24 were reported to be 0.41 mcg/mL, 0.05 mcg/mL, and 2.6 mcg·h/mL, respectively. These oral values are approximately 38%, 83%, and 52% of the values observed following a single 500-mg I.V. 3-hour infusion (Cmax: 1.08 mcg/mL, trough: 0.06 mcg/mL, and AUC24: 5.0 mcg·h/mL). Thus, plasma concentrations are higher following the intravenous regimen throughout the 24-hour interval. The pharmacokinetic parameters on day 5 of azithromycin 250 mg capsules following a 500 mg oral loading dose to healthy young adults (age 18-40 years old) were as follows: Cmax: 0.24 mcg/mL, AUC24: 2.1 mcg·h/mL. Tissue levels have not been obtained following intravenous infusions of azithromycin.\n\n【32】 - In a multiple-dose study in 12 normal volunteers utilizing a 500 mg (1 mg/mL) one-hour intravenous-dosage regimen for five days, the amount of administered azithromycin dose excreted in urine in 24 hours was about 11% after the 1st dose and 14% after the 5th dose. These values are greater than the reported 6% excreted unchanged in urine after oral administration of azithromycin. Biliary excretion is a major route of elimination for unchanged drug, following oral administration.\n- The serum protein binding of azithromycin is variable in the concentration range approximating human exposure decreasing from 51% at 0.02 mcg/mL to 7% at 2 mcg/mL.\n\n【33】 ### Microbiology\n- Azithromycin acts by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible microorganisms and, thus, interfering with microbial protein synthesis.

These MIC’s provide estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The MIC’s should be determined using a standardized procedure. Standardized procedures are based on a dilution method1 (broth or agar) or equivalent with standardized inoculum concentrations and standardized concentrations of azithromycin powder. The MIC values should be interpreted according to the following criteria:\n- The current absence of data on resistant strains precludes defining any categories other than \"Susceptible\"\n- No interpretive criteria have been established for testing Neisseria gonorrhoeae. This species is not usually tested.\n- A report of \"Susceptible\" indicates that the pathogen is likely to respond to monotherapy with azithromycin. A report of \"Intermediate\" indicates that the result should be considered equivocal, and, if the microorganism is not fully susceptible to alternative, clinically feasible drugs, the test should be repeated. This category implies possible clinical applicability in body sites where the drug is physiologically concentrated or in situations where high dosage of drug can be used. This category also provides a buffer zone which prevents small uncontrolled technical factors from causing major discrepancies in interpretation. A report of \"Resistant\" indicates that achievable drug concentrations are unlikely to be inhibitory; other therapy should be selected.\n- Standardized susceptibility test procedures require the use of laboratory control microorganisms to control the technical aspects of the laboratory procedures. Standard azithromycin powder should provide the following MIC values:\n- Reports from the laboratory providing results of the standard single-disk susceptibility test with a 15 mcg azithromycin disk should be interpreted according to the following criteria:\n- Interpretation should be as stated above for results using dilution techniques. Interpretation involves correlation of the diameter obtained in the disk test with the MIC for azithromycin.\n\n【35】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\nThere is limited information regarding Nonclinical Toxicology of Azithromycin (injection) in the drug label.\n\n【36】 #How Supplied\n- Azithromycin for injection is supplied in white to almost white lyophilized form under a vacuum in a 10-mL vial equivalent to 500 mg of azithromycin for intravenous administration.

Diabetes can make these injuries more difficult to heal. Unnoticed and untreated, even small foot injuries can quickly become infected, potentially leading to serious complications. - A good daily foot care routine may help keep your feet healthy: - Examine your feet and legs daily - Care for your nails regularly - Apply moisturizing lotion if your feet are dry (but not between the toes) - Wear properly fitting footwear - Test your bath water with your hand before you step in, to make sure the water is not too hot - If you have any corns (thick or hard skin on toes), calluses (thick skin on bottom of feet), ingrown toenails, warts, splinters or other wounds, have them treated by your doctor or other foot care specialist (such as a foot care nurse, podiatrist or chiropodist). Do not try to treat them yourself. - If you have any swelling, warmth, redness or pain in your legs or feet, see your health-care provider or foot specialist right away.\nFoot complications are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in people who have diabetes, and contribute to increased health care use and costs . People with diabetes who have peripheral neuropathy and peripheral arterial disease are at risk of developing foot ulcers and infection that may lead to lowerextremity amputation . The frequency of amputation is much higher in people with diabetes than people without diabetes . Preventive measures, foot care education, and early and aggressive treatment of diabetic foot problems are important components of diabetes care.\n\n【1】 #Risk Assessment\n\n【2】 Several wound classifications have been developed to provide objective assessment of foot ulcer severity. The simple Wagner classification is used commonly: Wagner Grade 0, skin intact; Grade 1, superficial ulcer; Grade 2, ulcer extending to tendon, capsule or bone; Grade 3, deep ulcer with osteomyelitis or abscess; Grade 4, gangrene of toes or forefoot; Grade 5, gangrene of midfoot or hindfoot. The University of Texas Diabetic Wound Classification System has been validated as a predictor of serious outcomes in people with diabetes who have foot ulcers  .\nIn people who have ischemia, the distribution of peripheral arterial disease is greater in the arterial tree below the knee in people with diabetes compared with people without diabetes . Noninvasive assessments for peripheral arterial disease in people with diabetes include the blood pressure (BP) ankle-brachial index (ratio of ankle to brachial systolic BP), systolic toe pressure by photoplethysmography, transcutaneous oximetry and Doppler arterial flow studies .\nIt is important to recognize the potential limitations inherent with noninvasive diagnostic tests for peripheral arterial disease .\nThe foot examination is important and should include footwear assessment  of the foot may help clarify this differential diagnosis, but no diagnostic imaging studies are definitive, and the results of all imaging studies must be interpreted carefully and correlated with the clinical presentation .\n\n【3】 #Preventive Care and Treatment\nPreventive measures against the risk of amputation include regular foot examination, evaluation of amputation risk, regular callus debridement, patient education, professionally fitted therapeutic footwear to reduce plantar pressure and accommodate foot deformities, and early detection and treatment of diabetic foot ulcers .\nSpecific recommendations about wound dressing types cannot be made for typical diabetic foot ulcers because there is insufficient evidence to support any type of dressing over another . The essentials of good wound care include maintaining an optimal wound environment, off-loading pressure from the ulcer and regular debridement of nonviable tissue .\nTreatment of the acute Charcot foot requires immobilization of the foot, typically for several months, in a total contact cast, removable walker boot or custom orthosis until consolidation occurs . Surgical stabilization may be indicated for Charcot arthropathy associated with marked instability, deformity or nonhealing ulcers.  - Sensation to 10 g monofilament\n- Exterior: signs of wear, penetrating objects - Interior: signs of wear, orthotics, foreign bodies Although bisphosphonates have been considered for the treatment of Charcot arthropathy, further studies are necessary to fully evaluate these agents and other medical therapies in the routine treatment of Charcot arthropathy . Infection may complicate foot ulcers and may progress rapidly to become limb and/or life threatening . When infections begin, the most frequent pathogens typically include Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus) and Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococcus). With persistent infection and the presence of devitalized tissue, gram-negative and anaerobic pathogens may cause polymicrobial infection .\nAchieving target glycemic control may be associated with decreased amputation frequency . Poor glycemic control may be associated with immunopathy and blunted cellular response to infection. Many people (50%) who have diabetes and a major limb infection may not have fever or leukocytosis at presentation . Deep infections require prompt surgical debridement and appropriate antibiotic therapy .\nIn medically suitable individuals who have peripheral arterial disease and a history of ulceration or amputation, distal limb revascularization may improve long-term limb salvage. Endovascular techniques with angioplasty and stenting for infrainguinal arteries may be effective to achieve limb salvage, but the long-term success is less in people with diabetes than people without diabetes .\nThere is limited evidence to confirm an added benefit of hyperbaric oxygen therapy in reducing the indication for amputation or improving wound healing in individuals with diabetes. Therefore, hyperbaric oxygen therapy is not recommended for the routine treatment of infected or noninfected neuropathic or ischemic foot ulcers. - Includes more severe infections, including more extensive cellulitis, plantar abscess and deep space infections - The choice of oral or parenteral should be guided by the extent of the infection and the patient's overall clinical status - Initial antimicrobial therapy against staphylococci, streptococci, anaerobes and common Enterobacteriaceae species - Empiric treatment targeting P. aeruginosa is generally unnecessary unless risk factors present (e.g. history of foot soaking, severe or chronic infection)\n\n【4】 Duration of therapy is based on clinical response. However, typical treatment courses for skin and soft tissue infections range from 7 (mild) to 21 (severe) days, and the treatment of osteomyelitis may require 4 to 6 weeks of parenteral or several months of oral antimicrobial therapy. Whenever possible, it is desirable to switch to oral antimicrobial therapy to avoid complications from parenteral administration.\n\n【5】 #Author Disclosures\nNo authors have anything to disclose.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": "无关文本#5#5#Author Disclosures.....作者披露", "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-05-08 01:38:00", "update_time": "2024-05-08 18:36:34"}

Disease appears to occur almost exclusively because of reactivation of latent tissue cysts.\n\n【2】 #Guidelines for Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in HIV-Infected Adults and Adolescents\nOutline of the Guideline:\n- Preventing Exposure\nInitiating Primary Prophylaxis\nDiscontinuing Primary Prophylaxis - Treatment of Disease\n- Monitoring and Adverse Events\n- Management of Treatment Failure\n- Special Considerations During Pregnancy\n\n【3】 #Preventing Exposure\nHIV-infected persons should be tested for IgG antibody to Toxoplasma soon after the diagnosis of HIV infection to detect latent infection with T. gondii (BIII).\nHIV-infected persons, including those who lack IgG antibody to Toxoplasma, should be counseled regarding sources of Toxoplasma infection. To minimize risk for acquiring toxoplasmosis, HIV-infected persons should be advised not to eat raw or undercooked meat, including undercooked lamb, beef, pork, or venison (BIII). Specifically, lamb, beef, venison, and pork should be cooked to an internal temperature of 165ºF--170ºF; meat cooked until it is no longer pink inside usually has an internal temperature of 165ºF--170ºF and therefore, from a more practical perspective, satisfies this requirement. To minimize the risk for acquiring toxoplasmosis, HIV-infected persons should wash their hands after contact with raw meat and after gardening or other contact with soil; in addition, they should wash fruits and vegetables well before eating them raw (BIII).  If the patient owns a cat, the litter box should be changed daily, preferably by an HIV-negative, nonpregnant person; alternatively, patients should wash their hands thoroughly after changing the litter box (BIII). Patients should be encouraged to keep their cats inside and not to adopt or handle stray cats (BIII).\n\n【4】 ## Initiating Primary Prophylaxis\nToxoplasma-seropositive patients who have a CD4+ count of <100 cells/µL should be administered prophylaxis against TE (AII). The double-strength tablet daily dose of TMP-SMX recommended as the preferred regimen for PCP prophylaxis also is effective against TE and is therefore recommended (AII). TMP-SMX, one double-strength tablet three times weekly, is an alternative (BIII).  If patients cannot tolerate TMP-SMX, the recommended alternative is dapsone-pyrimethamine plus leucovorin, which is also effective against PCP (BI).Atovaquone with or without pyrimethamine/leucovorin also can be considered (CIII). Prophylactic monotherapy with dapsone, pyrimethamine, azithromycin, or clarithromycin cannot be recommended on the basis of available data (DII). Aerosolized pentamidine does not protect against TE and is not recommended (EI).\nToxoplasma-seronegative persons who are not taking a PCP prophylactic regimen known to be active against TE (e.g. aerosolized pentamidine) should be retested for IgG antibody to Toxoplasma when their CD4+ counts decline to <100 cells/µL to determine whether they have seroconverted and are therefore at risk for TE (CIII). Patients who have seroconverted should be administered prophylaxis for TE as described previously (AII).\n\n【5】 ## Discontinuing Primary Prophylaxis\nProphylaxis against TE should be discontinued among adult and adolescent patients who have responded to ART with an increase in CD4+ counts to >200 cells/µL for >3 months (AI). Multiple observational studies and two randomized trials  have reported that primary prophylaxis can be discontinued with minimal risk for developing TE among patients who have responded to ART with an increase in CD4+ count from 200 cells/µL for >3 months. In these studies, the majority of patients were taking PI-containing regimens and the median CD4+ count at the time prophylaxis was discontinued was >300 cells/µL. At the time prophylaxis was discontinued, the majority of patients had sustained suppression of plasma HIV RNA levels below the detection limits of available assays; the median follow-up was 7--22 months. Although patients with CD4+ counts of 200 cells/µL. Thus, the recommendation specifies discontinuing prophylaxis after an increase to >200 cells/µL. Discontinuing primary TE prophylaxis is recommended because prophylaxis at CD4+ count >200 cells/ µL adds limited disease prevention for toxoplasmosis and because discontinuing drugs reduces pill burden, potential for drug toxicity, drug interaction, selection of drug-resistant pathogens, and cost. Prophylaxis for TE should be reintroduced if the CD4+ count decreases to <100--200 cells/µL (AIII).\n\n【6】 #Treatment of Disease\nThe initial therapy of choice for TE consists of the combination of pyrimethamine plus sulfadiazine plus leucovorin (AI). Pyrimethamine penetrates the brain parenchyma efficiently even in the absence of inflammation. Use of leucovorin reduces the likelihood of the hematologic toxicities associated with pyrimethamine therapy. The preferred alternative regimen for patients with TE who are unable to tolerate or who fail to respond to first-line therapy is pyrimethamine plus clindamycin plus leucovorin (AI).\nTMP-SMX was reported in a small (77 patient) randomized trial to be effective and better tolerated than pyrimethamine-sulfadiazine. On the basis of less in vitro activity and less experience with this regimen, pyrimethamine plus sulfadiazine with leucovorin is the preferred therapy (BI). For patients who cannot take an oral regimen, no well-studied options exist. No parenteral formulation of pyrimethamine exists; the only widely available parenteral sulfonamide is the sulfamethoxazole component of TMP-SMX. Therefore, certain specialists will treat severely ill patients requiring parenteral therapy initially with oral pyrimethamine plus parenteral TMP-SMX or parenteral clindamycin (CIII).\nAt least three regimens have activity in the treatment of TE in at least two, nonrandomized, uncontrolled trials, although their relative efficacy compared with the previous regimens is unknown:\n- 1 atovaquone (with meals or oral nutritional supplements) plus pyrimethamine plus leucovorin (BII)\n- 2 Atovaquone combined with sulfadiazine or, for patients intolerant of both pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine, as a single agent  (BII) (if atovaquone is used alone, measuring plasma levels might be helpful given the high variability of absorption of the drug among different patients; plasma levels of >18.5 µg/mL are associated with an improved response rate).\n- 3 Azithromycin plus pyrimethamine plus leucovorin daily (BII).\nAcute therapy should be continued for at least 6 weeks, if there is clinical and radiologic improvement (BII). Longer courses might be appropriate if clinical or radiologic disease is extensive or response is incomplete at 6 weeks. Adjunctive corticosteroids (e.g. dexamethasone) should be administered when clinically indicated only for treatment of a mass effect associated with focal lesions or associated edema (BIII). Because of the potential immunosuppressive effects of corticosteroids, they should be discontinued as soon as clinically feasible. Patients receiving corticosteroids should be closely monitored for the development of other OIs, including cytomegalovirus retinitis and TB disease.\nAnticonvulsants should be administered to patients with a history of seizures (AIII), but should not be administered prophylactically to all patients (DIII). Anticonvulsants, if administered, should be continued at least through the period of acute therapy.\n\n【7】 #Monitoring and Adverse Events\nChanges in antibody titers are not useful for monitoring responses to therapy. Patients should be routinely monitored for adverse events and clinical and radiologic improvement (AIII). Common pyrimethamine toxicities include rash, nausea, and bone-marrow suppression (neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia) that can often be reversed by increasing the dose of leucovorin to 50--100 mg/day administered in divided doses (CIII).\nCommon sulfadiazine toxicities include rash, fever, leukopenia, hepatitis, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and crystalluria. Common clindamycin toxicities include fever, rash, nausea, diarrhea (including pseudomembranous colitis or diarrhea related to Clostridium difficile toxin), and hepatotoxicity. Common TMP-SMX toxicities include rash, fever, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and hepatotoxicity. Drug interactions between anticonvulsants and antiretroviral agent should be carefully evaluated and doses adjusted according to established guidelines.\n\n【8】 #Management of Treatment Failure\nA brain biopsy, if not previously performed, should be strongly considered for patients who fail to respond to initial therapy (BII) as defined by clinical or radiologic deterioration during the first week despite adequate therapy or lack of clinical improvement within 2 weeks. For those who undergo brain biopsy and have confirmed histopathologic evidence of TE, a switch to an alternative regimen as previously described should be considered (BIII). Recurrence of disease during secondary maintenance therapy following an initial clinical and radiographic response is unusual if patients adhere to their regimen.\n\n【9】 #Prevention of Recurrence\nPatients who have successfully completed a 6-week course of initial therapy for TE should be administered lifelong secondary prophylaxis . Secondary prophylaxis should be started again if the CD4+ T lymphocyte count decreases to <200 cells/µL (AIII).\n\n【10】 #Special Considerations During Pregnancy\nDocumentation of maternal T. gondii serologic status should be obtained during pregnancy. Indications for treatment of T. gondii during pregnancy should be based on confirmed or suspected symptomatic disease in the mother. Pediatric care providers should be informed if the HIV-1--infected mother is seropositive for T. gondii infection to allow evaluation of the neonate for evidence of congenital infection. Pregnant HIV-1--infected women with suspected or confirmed primary T. gondii infection during pregnancy should be managed in consultation with a maternal-fetal medicine or other appropriate specialist (BIII).\nTreatment should be the same as in nonpregnant adults (BIII). Although pyrimethamine has been associated with birth defects in animals, limited human data have not suggested an increased risk for defects and, therefore, it can be administered to pregnant women. Pediatric providers should be notified if sulfadiazine is continued until delivery because its use might increase the risk for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia and kernicterus.\nAlthough perinatal transmission of T. gondii normally occurs only with acute infection in the immunocompetent host, case reports have documented occurrences of transmission with reactivation of chronic infection in HIV-1--infected women with severe immunosuppression. Because the risk for transmission with chronic infection appears low, routine evaluation of the fetus for infection with amniocentesis or cordocentesis is not indicated. Detailed ultrasound examination of the fetus specifically evaluating for hydrocephalus, cerebral calcifications, and growth restriction should be done for HIV-1--infected women with suspected primary or symptomatic reactivation of T. gondii during pregnancy.\n\n【11】 - Toxoplasma gondii\n- Opportunistic infections\n- HIV opportunistic infection pneumocystis pneumonia: prevention and treatment guidelines", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-05-08 01:38:00", "update_time": "2024-05-08 22:09:10"}

Routine supervision of therapy should be managed by locally agreed shared care protocols undertaken by general practitioners\n\n【2】 #Clinical Need and Practice\nMotor neurone disease (MND) is characterised by progressive degeneration of the motor neurones of the brain, brain stem or spinal cord. Depending on the site of the lesions, characteristic signs may include spasticity, muscle stiffness, brisk or diminished reflexes, muscle wasting and fasciculation, and both flaccid and/or spastic weakness.\nThe classification and terminology used to describe the different Motor Neurone Disease syndromes are not always clear or consistent. This partly reflects uncertainties surrounding the underlying causes of MND and the mechanism of neuronal damage. There is also debate about the extent to which different syndromes are simply manifestations of the same disease process or whether there are several different disease mechanisms.\nThe term 'Motor Neurone Disease' is used to describe variants of the disease – namely progressive muscular atrophy (PMA) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) which includes Progressive Bulbar Palsy (PBP). ALS, which is characterised by both upper and lower motor neurone signs, is the most common form of MND, accounting for 65% to 85% of all cases. Adult onset MND usually starts insidiously with symptoms and signs including stumbling, foot drop, weakened grip, slurred speech, cramp, muscle wasting, twitching and tiredness. Other symptoms of MND include muscle stiffness, paralysis, incoordination and impaired speech, swallowing and breathing. Most individuals die from ventilatory failure, resulting from progressive weakness and wasting of limb, respiratory and bulbar muscles within approximately 3 years of the onset of symptoms.\nThe incidence of ALS ranges from 1.8 to 2.2 per 100,000 population and prevalence ranges from 4.0 to 4.7 per 100,000 population in UK. Therefore at any one time about 2000 individuals per year in England and Wales are affected by ALS.\nSupportive and palliative care is currently available for people with MND. A wide range of multidisciplinary health and social services is required, particularly in the late stages of the disease, and need to be tailored to suit individual needs. NHS, personal social service and voluntary sector services needed include physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech and language therapy and augmentative communication, mobility aids and district nursing support. In the later stages of the disease, the following interventions may also be required: enteral feeding (for severe dysphagia), domiciliary or hospice care, and ventilatory support, including mechanical ventilation and tracheostomy\n\n【3】 #The Technology\nRiluzole (Rilutek) is currently the only drug licensed for treating ALS in the UK. The licensed indication of riluzole is to extend life or the time to mechanical ventilation for individuals with ALS. The Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) recommends that riluzole should not be used in any other form of Motor Neurone Disease. The SPC also suggests that treatment should only be initiated by specialist physicians with experience in the management of Motor Neurone Disease.\nIt is hypothesised that excessive stimulation of glutamate receptors on neurones may cause or play an important role in the destruction of motor neurones in MND. Glutamate is a neurotransmitter that tends to excite motor neurone cells. In vitro, riluzole inhibits the release of glutamate; decreases firing of motor neurones induced by glutamate receptor agonists and thus protects cells from glutamate-mediated damage.\nFour randomised controlled trials (including a number of UK centres) in patients who fall within the diagnostic category of ALS have compared riluzole with placebo (a total of 1477 individuals). Three trials used riluzole at 100 mg/day and one used doses of 50, 100 and 200mg/day. Individuals were under 75 years, had a Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) ≥60% in three trials, with two of these also excluding patients who had suffered from MND for more than 5 years. The fourth trial recruited individuals who were older or who had a greater duration of disease (> 5 years) or who had a FVC<60%.\nAll trials used tracheostomy-free survival as a primary outcome. Most individuals (in all four trials) were prevalent, rather than incident cases.\nWhen data on functional status were combined, a small reduction in the rate of deterioration of functional status was observed, although the statistical methods used to calculate changes were questionable. Furthermore it is not clear whether the estimated differences obtained using these methods were clinically significant.\nThere was little evidence of a difference in adverse events between riluzole and placebo.\nThere is strong clinical support for the use of riluzole in forms of MND other than ALS but the current licensed indications limit its use to ALS alone. The inclusion criteria for the published clinical trials has been restricted to a diagnosis of the ALS form of MND alone.\nCurrent estimates of the cost-effectiveness of riluzole must be viewed cautiously. Some of the key remaining uncertainties on benefits for the economic analysis concern the disease stage(s) in which the survival gain is experienced, the quality of life utility weights for ALS health states and the mean gain in life expectancy for individuals who take riluzole. Estimates from the two fully published trials suggest a gain in median tracheostomy free survival time of 2 months to 4 months. It is clear that riluzole is associated with a net increase in costs to the health service, though the magnitude of the increase is difficult to predict accurately.\nUsing a published Markov model and 18 month trial follow up data, the manufacturer's submission provided a base case cost per quality adjusted life year (cost/QALY) estimate of £18,000 to £29,000 for riluzole. Based on a re-analysis of this Markov model using an alternative, more conservative, estimate of time-dependant probabilities, the assessment report derived discounted cost per QALY estimates for riluzole of between approximately £34,000 to £43, 500. These later estimates are consistent with the results obtained by the assessment report authors when using Weibull and Gompertz models to extrapolate survival over time.\n\n【4】 A diagnosis of MND should be made or confirmed by a specialist physician with experience in the management of Motor Neurone Disease after appropriate investigations. In most cases, the specialist will be responsible for monitoring the progress of the disease and the safe use of riluzole. The needs of people with MND demand flexibility, and this monitoring role can be taken up by the general practitioner or by other physicians involved in providing shared care.\nIn the latter stages of their disease, patients may wish to review their continued use of riluzole and they should be provided with the opportunity to discontinue treatment, if after discussion with the responsible clinician, they consider it appropriate\n\n【5】 #Further research\nFurther trials of riluzole are required to examine the relative effectiveness of differing dosing regimens.\nMethods for the early diagnosis of MND require development as they may enable earlier treatment and enhanced clinical outcomes\n\n【6】 #Review of guidance\nInformation on the review of the guidance on this technology is available on the NICE website\n\n【7】 The following documentation and opinion was made available to the Committee:\na.

An acceptable range of the length of a core promoter is typically 60 to 120 base pairs.\nGenomics definition: short sequences surrounding the transcription start sites (TSSs).\nIt contains a binding site for RNA polymerase (RNA polymerase I, RNA polymerase II, or RNA polymerase III) holoenzymes.\nA vast network of regulatory factors that contribute to the initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase ultimately target any specific gene’s core promoter.\nThe core promoter includes the transcription start site(s) (TSS).\nThat portion of the core promoter that is upstream of the TSS is also part of the proximal promoter.\nThe core promoter is approximately -34 bp upstream from the TSS. \"Several factors have been identified that bind to core promoters (reviewed in Smale, 1997)\".\n\n【1】 #Genetics\nGenetics involves the expression, transmission, and variation of inherited characteristics.\n\n【2】 #Gene transcriptions\nDNA is a double helix of interlinked nucleotides surrounded by an epigenome. On the basis of biochemical signals, an enzyme, specifically a ribonucleic acid (RNA) polymerase, is chemically bonded to one of the strands (the template strand) of this double helix. The polymerase, once phosphorylated, begins to catalyze the formation of RNA using the template strand. Although the catalysis may have more than one beginning nucleotide (a start site) and more than one ending nucleotide (a stop site) along the DNA, each nucleotide sequence catalyzed that ultimately produces approximately the same RNA is part of a gene. The catalysis of each RNA representation from the template DNA is a transcription, specifically a gene transcription. The overall process is also referred to as gene transcription.\n\n【3】 #Promoters\nDef.\n\n【4】 #Proximal promoters\n\n【5】 #Cores\nDef. a central or most important part of something is called a core.\n\n【6】 #Theoretical core promoters\nDef. \"the factors, including RNA polymerase II itself, that are minimally essential for transcription in vitro from an isolated core promoter\" is called the basal machinery, or basal transcription machinery.\n\n【7】 #Metal responsive elements\nA metal responsive element (MRE), or TGC box, may occur in the core promoter of some human DNA genes.\n\"The metallothionein (MT) genes provide a good example of eucaryotic promoter architecture. MT genes specify the synthesis of low-molecular-weight metal-binding proteins. They are transcriptionally regulated by the metal ions cadmium and zinc , glucocorticoid hormones , interferon , interleukin-1 , and tumor promoters . The metal ion regulation of MTs is conferred by a short sequence element called the metal-responsive element (MRE ) or TGC box , which functions as a metal ion-dependent enhancer.\"\n\n【8】 #GC boxes\nDef. a \"sequence of contiguous guanine, guanine, guanine, cytosine, and guanine, in that order, along a DNA strand\" is called a GC box.\n\" GC box is a distinct pattern of nucleotides found in the promoter region of some eukaryotic genes upstream of the TATA box and approximately 110 bases upstream from the transcription initiation site. It has a consensus sequence GGGCGG which is position dependent and orientation independent. The GC elements are bound by transcription factors and have similar functions to enhancers.\"\n\"A large subclass of polymerase II promoters lacks both TATAA and CCAAT sequence motifs but contains multiple GC boxes. This promoter class includes several housekeeping genes (e.g. the genes encoding dihydrofolate reductase  . hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase , hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase , and adenosine deaminase )  nonhousekeeping genes (e.g. the transforming growth factor alpha , rat malic enzyme , human c-Ha-ras , epidermal growth factor receptor , and nerve growth factor receptor  genes).\"\n\"In promoters containing multiple GC boxes but lacking the TATAA box, transcription start sites may be single and specific, as observed in the nerve growth factor receptor gene  and the cellular retinol-binding protein gene , or there may be multiple heterogeneous start sites, such as those found in the c-myb , insulin receptor , and Ha-ras  genes, GC boxes are responsible for directing transcription from the major and the minor start sites, All TATAA-less promoters have at least two GC boxes\".\n\"A GC box sequence, one of the most common regulatory DNA elements of eukaryotic genes, is recognized by the Spl transcription factor; its consensus sequence is represented as 5'-G/T G/A GGCG G/T G/A G/A C/T-3'  .\"\n\n【9】 #HY boxes\nA core responsive element is the hypertrophy region HY box between -89 and -60 nucleotides (nts) upstream from the transcription start site.\n\n【10】 #CAAT boxes\n\" CCAAT box (also sometimes abbreviated a CAAT box or CAT box) is a distinct pattern of nucleotides with GGCCAATCT consensus sequence that occur upstream by 75-80 bases to the initial transcription site. The CAAT box signals the binding site for the RNA transcription factor, and is typically accompanied by a conserved consensus sequence. It is an invariant DNA sequence at about minus 70 base pairs from the origin of transcription in many eukaryotic promoters. Genes that have this element seem to require it for the gene to be transcribed in sufficient quantities. It is frequently absent from genes that encode proteins used in virtually all cells. This box along with the GC box is known for binding general transcription factors. CAAT and GC are primarily located in the region from 100-150bp upstream from the TATA box. Both of these consensus sequences belong to the regulatory promoter. Full gene expression occurs when transcription activator proteins bind to each module within the regulatory promoter. Protein specific binding is required for the CCAAT box activation. These proteins are known as CCAAT box binding proteins/CCAAT box binding factors. A CCAAT box is a feature frequently found before eukaryote coding regions\".\n\n【11】 #B recognition elements\n\"The B recognition element (BRE) is a DNA sequence found in the promoter region of most genes in eukaryotes and Archaea. The BRE is a cis-regulatory element that is found immediately upstream of the TATA box, and consists of 7 nucleotides.\"\nThe consensus sequence is 5’-G/C G/C G/A C G C C-3’.\nThe general consensus sequence using degenerate nucleotides is 5’-SSRCGCC-3’, where S = G or C and R = A or G.\n\n【12】 #EIF4E basal elements\nThe EIF4E basal element, also eIF4E, (4EBE) is a basal promoter element for the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E. \"Interactions between 4EBE and upstream activator sites are position, distance, and sequence dependent.\"\n\n【13】 #TATA boxes\nDef. a \"DNA sequence (cis-regulatory element) found in the promoter region of genes in archaea and eukaryotes\" is called a TATA box.\nThe TATA box can be an AT-rich sequence \"located at a fixed distance upstream of the transcription start site\".\n\n【14】 #TBP-like factors\nNotation: let the symbol TLF designate a TATA binding protein-like factor.\nThe human gene TBPL1 (TBP-like 1, also TLF and TRF2), GeneID: 9519, encodes a protein that \"does not bind to the TATA box and initiates transcription from TATA-less promoters.\"\n\n【15】 #Downstream TFIIB recognition\nThe downstream TFIIB recognition element (dBRE) has a consensus sequence in the transcription direction on the template strand of 3'-RTDKKKK-5', using degenerate nucleotides, or 3'-A/G-T-A/G/T-G/T-G/T-G/T-G/T-5'.\ndBRE is cis-TATA box, between the TATA box and the Inr or transcription start site (TSS) and trans-TSS.\n\n【16】 #Initiator elements\nFor RNA polymerase II holoenzyme to transcribe a gene, the gene's promoter must be located. After the promoter is located, the transcription start site (TSS) is pinpointed by using nucleotide sequences that include the TSS or perhaps allow distance measurement to the TSS. Within the promoter, most human genes lack a TATA box and have an initiator element (Inr) or downstream promoter element instead.\n\"RNA pol II itself recognizes features of the Inr which might assist the correct positioning of the polymerase on the promoter .\"\n\n【17】 #Transcription start sites\nThe transcription start site (TSS) is the location on the DNA template strand where transcription begins at the 3'-end of a gene. This location corresponds to the 5'-end of the mRNA which by convention is used to designate DNA locations. For example, the 5'-TATA-box-3' designation refers to the directionality of the mRNA and corresponds to the 3'-TATA-box-5' designation for nucleotides on the template strand. The template strand is the DNA strand being transcribed by RNA polymerase.\n\n【18】 #Downstream core elements\n\"onredundant human promoter sequences 600 bp long (−499 to +100 bp around the TSS)  from  Eukaryotic Promoter Database (EPD) release 75 \".\nThe downstream core element (DCE) is a transcription core promoter sequence that is within the transcribed portion of a gene.\nThe consensus sequence for the DCE is CTTC.CTGT.AGC. These three consensus elements are referred to as subelements: \"SI is CTTC, SII is CTGT, and SIII is AGC.\"\nThe number of nucleotides between each subelement can apparently vary down to none.\nA core promoter that contains all three subelements may be much less common than one containing only one or two. \"SI resides approximately from +6 to +11, SII from +16 to +21, and SIII from +30 to +34.\"\nSI as 3'-CTTC-5' can occur as 3 of 4 (CTT, TTC) or 4 of 4 (CTTC). SII as 3'-CTGT-5' can also occur as 3 of 4 (CTG, TGT) or 4 of 4 (CTGT). SIII as AGC is not known to vary.\nDCE SIII can function independently of SI and SII.\nTranscription factor II D (TFIID), a transcription factor that is part of the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme, interacts with promoters containing only SIII of the DCE suggesting a critical spacing parameter between SIII and the TATA box, initiator element, or some combination of the two. TFIID probably serves as a core promoter recognition complex.\nTAF1 interacts with the DCE in a sequence-dependent manner.\n- \"TATA- and DPE-dependent promoters are specific for particular enhancers\", - \"preferences of activators for specific core promoter architectures\", and - \"the presence of a DCE or  might be indicative of an architecture designed for specific regulatory networks, such as the regulation of housekeeping promoters versus tissue-specific promoters (or other highly regulated promoters) or the regulation of subsets of viral promoters.\"\n\n【19】 #Motif ten elements\nThe motif ten element (MTE) is a downstream core promoter element that \"promotes transcription by RNA polymerase II when it is located precisely at positions +18 to +27 relative to A+1 in the initiator (Inr) element.\"\nThe motif 10 consensus sequence is CSARCSSAACGS . By convention, the consensus sequence 5'-C-C/G-A-A/G-C-C/G-C/G-A-A-C-G-C/G-3' is stated as it would be translated into mRNA. In the direction of transcription on the template strand this consensus sequence becomes 3'-C-C/G-A-A/G-C-C/G-C/G-A-A-C-G-C/G-5'.\n\n【20】 #Downstream promoter elements\n\"The downstream promoter element (DPE) is a core promoter element . present in other species including humans and excluding Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Like all core promoters, the DPE plays an important role in the initiation of gene transcription by RNA polymerase II.\"\nThe core sequence of the DPE is located precisely +28 to +32 nts relative to the A+1 nt in the Inr.\n\n【21】 #Hypotheses\n- Each portion of a DNA that becomes active has a core promoter.\n- The \"minimal portion of the promoter required to properly initiate transcription\".", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": "语义不完整#3#3#Def.没说完", "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-05-08 01:38:00", "update_time": "2024-05-08 19:32:03"}

NMU is an alkylating agent, and exhibits its toxicity by transferring its methyl group to nucleobases in nucleic acids, which can lead to AT:GC transition mutations.\nNMU is the traditional precursor in the synthesis of diazomethane. However, since it is unstable at temperatures beyond 20 °C and shock-sensitive to a degree, for this purpose it has become obsolete and replaced by other (N-methyl)nitrosamides. Most chemical supply houses have stopped carrying it.\nAcute exposure to NMU in humans can result in skin and eye irritation, headache, nausea, and vomiting.  NMU is reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen based on sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals (IARC 1972, 1978, 1987).  Various cancers induced in animal models include: squamous cell carcinomas of the forestomach, sarcomas and gliomas of the brain, adenocarcinomas of the pancreas, leukemia, and lymphomas.

It is recommended only if:\ntumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha inhibitors are not suitable or do not control the condition well enough and the company provides upadacitinib according to the commercial arrangement.\nAssess response to upadacitinib after 16 weeks of treatment. Continue treatment only if there is clear evidence of response, defined as a reduction in:\nthe Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) score to 50% of the pretreatment value or by 2 or more units and the spinal pain visual analogue scale (VAS) by 2 cm or more.\nTake into account any physical, sensory or learning disabilities, or communication difficulties that could affect the responses to the BASDAI and spinal pain VAS and make any adjustments needed.\nIf patients and their clinicians consider upadacitinib to be 1 of a range of suitable treatments (including secukinumab and ixekizumab), discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the available treatments. After that discussion, if more than 1 treatment is suitable, choose the least expensive. Take account of administration costs, dosage, price per dose and commercial arrangements.\nThese recommendations are not intended to affect treatment with upadacitinib that was started in the NHS before this guidance was published. People having treatment outside these recommendations may continue without change to the funding arrangements in place for them before this guidance was published, until they and their NHS clinician consider it appropriate to stop.\nWhy the committee made these recommendations\nUsual treatment for active non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis in adults that is not controlled well enough with NSAIDs, and when TNF-alpha inhibitors are not suitable or do not control the condition well enough, is secukinumab or ixekizumab. These are biological treatments. Upadacitinib is another biological treatment.\nEvidence from clinical trials shows that upadacitinib reduces symptoms and improves quality of life better than placebo. Indirect comparisons suggest that upadacitinib works as well as secukinumab and ixekizumab.\nA cost comparison suggests upadacitinib has similar costs and overall health benefits as secukinumab and ixekizumab. So upadacitinib is recommended\n\n【3】 #Information about upadacitinib\n\n【4】 #Marketing authorisation indication\nUpadacitinib , who have responded inadequately to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)'.\n\n【5】 #Dosage in the marketing authorisation\nThe dosage schedule is available in the summary of product characteristics for upadacitinib.\n\n【6】 The list price is £805.56 per 28‑tablet pack, with each tablet containing 15 mg of upadacitinib (excluding VAT; BNF online, accessed November 2022). The annual cost of treatment with one 15‑mg tablet per day is £10,501.05 (excluding VAT; BNF online, accessed November 2022).\nThe company has a commercial arrangement. This makes upadacitinib available to the NHS with a discount. The size of the discount is commercial in confidenc\n\n【7】 #Committee discussion\nThe evaluation committee considered evidence submitted by AbbVie, a review of this submission by the external assessment group (EAG), and responses from stakeholders\n\n【8】 ## Cost comparison\nThe company proposed that upadacitinib should be considered in adults as an alternative to the currently NICE-recommended interleukin (IL)‑17 inhibitors secukinumab and ixekizumab for active non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis that is not controlled well enough with conventional therapy and when TNF‑alpha inhibitors are not suitable or do not control the condition well enough. The committee agreed that the proposed population was consistent with previous recommendations for IL‑17 inhibitors for active non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis, and with their use in clinical practice. The company presented a comparison with 2 NICE-recommended IL‑17 inhibitors (NICE technology appraisal guidance on secukinumab for treating non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis and ixekizumab for treating axial spondyloarthritis). The committee agreed that this was consistent with the criteria for a cost-comparison evaluation.\n\n【9】 ## Comparators\nSecukinumab and ixekizumab are anti‑IL-17 injections recommended by NICE for treating non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis. Upadacitinib is an oral JAK inhibitor. The clinical and patient experts highlighted the convenience of upadacitinib over IL‑17 inhibitors owing to its oral administration. They also suggested that upadacitinib would be especially helpful for people with needle phobias or dexterity issues that make self-injecting difficult. Clinical advice to the EAG suggested that secukinumab is chosen more often than ixekizumab for treating active non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis. Secukinumab has been available for ankylosing spondylitis since 2016, suggesting that secukinumab is more established in NHS clinical practice than ixekizumab, which became available in 2021. The committee concluded that secukinumab and ixekizumab are appropriate comparators for upadacitinib, but that secukinumab was the more relevant comparator.\n\n【10】 ## Data sources\nUpadacitinib has been studied in 1 randomised controlled trial including 313 adults with active non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (SELECT‑AXIS 2, study 2). It was compared with placebo. In SELECT‑AXIS 2, study 2, upadacitinib was associated with statistically significant improvements compared with placebo in the primary and secondary outcomes, including the Assessment in Spondyloarthritis international Society 40% (ASAS40) response, BASDAI 50 score and total back pain score. Upadacitinib was associated with higher ASAS40 and BASDAI 50 responses and total back pain score improvement at week 14 than placebo. People having upadacitinib also had statistically significantly higher scores in the Ankylosing Spondylitis Quality of Life (ASQoL) measure. The committee concluded that upadacitinib was more clinically effective than placebo.\n\n【11】 ## Network meta-analysis\nThe company did a series of network meta-analyses comparing clinical-effectiveness data for upadacitinib (SELECT‑AXIS 2, study 2) with data for secukinumab (PREVENT) and ixekizumab (COAST‑X). The analyses investigated measures of efficacy, including binary outcomes (ASAS40, BASDAI 50) and continuous outcomes (BASDAI  and Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index ). The EAG highlighted that although the median values favoured upadacitinib over ixekizumab (except for BASDAI 50 score) and secukinumab, the credible intervals were wide. It explained that the health benefits for all treatments could be similar, but could also differ. The clinical experts stated in their submission that they would expect upadacitinib to provide clinically meaningful benefits compared with IL‑17 inhibitors. The EAG also identified heterogeneity between the trials included in the network meta-analysis that may impact its validity, but acknowledged that there were no studies available that directly compared upadacitinib with either secukinumab or ixekizumab The committee concluded that the network meta-analysis was uncertain, but supported the company's position that upadacitinib has similar clinical effectiveness to secukinumab and ixekizumab.\n\n【12】 ## Safety comparisons between trials\nThe company provided safety data comparing upadacitinib with placebo (SELECT‑AXIS 2, study 2), secukinumab (PREVENT) and ixekizumab (COAST‑X). The company and EAG agreed that the safety profiles of all treatments were broadly similar. However, the EAG highlighted that the company had only provided naive comparisons, and the differences between adverse event incidence between the trials was likely to be influenced by differences in trial design, length of follow up and differences in adverse event definitions in each trial. The committee agreed with the EAG. It concluded that it was difficult to draw definitive conclusions from the safety data, and formal modelling of the available safety data would have been helpful for decision making.\n\n【13】 ## Cost-comparison estimates\nThe company presented a base-case cost-comparison analysis that modelled the total costs of upadacitinib, secukinumab and ixekizumab over 5 years. It also provided a scenario analysis modelling the costs over 10 years. It considered that the clinical evidence available supported the assumption of clinical equivalence between upadacitinib, secukinumab and ixekizumab. The EAG was satisfied with the company's cost-comparison analysis methods, so did not provide its own cost-comparison estimates. Taking into account the confidential patient access schemes for upadacitinib, secukinumab and ixekizumab, the committee concluded that the total costs associated with upadacitinib were similar to or lower than those associated with secukinumab and ixekizumab. The discounts for all treatments are confidential, so the incremental costs cannot be shared here.\n\n【14】 ## Recommendation\nThe committee concluded that the criteria for a cost comparison were met because:\nupadacitinib provided similar overall health benefits to those of secukinumab or ixekizumab, and the total costs associated with upadacitinib were similar to or lower than the total costs associated with secukinumab or ixekizumab. The committee therefore recommended upadacitinib as an option for treating active non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis in adults.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-05-08 01:38:00", "update_time": "2024-05-08 18:05:23"}

Excoriation disorder may be related to body dysmorphic disorder (BDD).\nSufferers of dermatillomania find skin picking to be stress relieving or gratifying, though it can still be as physically painful as it would be for a non-skin picker.\n\n【2】 #Historical Perspective\n- Lous-Anne-Jean Brocq was the first person to mention excoriation disorder on paper. She used the term in 1898 to describe a patient who uncontrollably picked their acne.\n\n【3】 #Classification\n- The DSM-5 changed excoriation disorder's classification from \"impulse control disorder\" to \"excoriation (skin-picking) disorder.\n- Excoriation disorder was originally known as \"dermatillomania\" before the DSM\n- The inability to control the urge to pick is similar to trichotillomania. Recent research suggests that, like trichotillomania, dermatillomania may be an impulse control disorder.  This is part of the obsessive compulsive disorder spectrum.\n- In some animal models, it has been shown that animals that who excessively pull their hairs have more endorphin receptors in their brain than animals who do not. Endorphin receptors enable endorphins to have an effect on the brain. If this is true for humans, people who are particularly compulsive about their repetitive habits may have more endorphin receptors in their brain as well.

Most liver diseases cause only mild symptoms initially, but it is vital that these diseases be detected early. Hepatic (liver) involvement in some diseases can be of crucial importance.\n\n【2】 #General approach\n- Patients with hepatocellular process, have higher elevations in the serum aminotransferases compared to alkaline phosphatase. However, patients with cholestatic process have the opposite lab findings.\n- The elevated serum bilirubin is a non-specific finding and can be elevated in both hepatocellular and cholestatic conditions.\n- Unconjugated bilirubin is tightly bound to albumin and is not filtered by the glomerulus. Thus, presence of unconjugated bilirubin in urine suggest an underlying kidney disease.\n- Conjugated bilirubin may be found in the urine when the total serum bilirubin concentration is normal. This is so, because the renal capacity for resorption of conjugated bilirubin is low. Additionally, the methods used can detect urinary bilirubin as low as 0.05 mg/dL. Thus, bilirubinuria can be an early sign of liver disease.\n- A low albumin suggests a chronic process such as cirrhosis or cancer, while a normal albumin suggests a more acute process such as viral hepatitis or choledocholithiasis.\n- Elevated Prothrombin time suggests either vitamin K deficiency, malabsorption of vitamin K or significant hepatocellular dysfunction. Failure in correction of prothrombin time with parenteral vitamin K indicates severe hepatocellular injury.\n- Approach to mild (less than 4 times the upper limit of normal) chronic (≥ 6 months) elevation in aminotransferase:\n\n【3】 Alcoholism -  An AST to ALT ratio of 2:1 or greater is suggestive of alcohol abuse. Of note, a similar AST/ALT ratio can also be seen in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and hepatitis C with development of cirrhosis. A 2 fold elevation of the gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT) in patients whose AST to ALT ratio is greater than 2:1 strongly suggests alcohol abuse.\nThe following tests should be ordered in patients with suspected Hepatitis B: Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), Hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb), Hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb)\nAssess for hemochromatosis, and fatty liver.\n\n【4】 ## 5' nucleotidase (5'NTD)\n5' nucleotidase is another test specific for cholestasis or damage to the intra or extrahepatic biliary system, and in some laboratories, is used as a substitute for GGT for ascertaining whether an elevated ALP is of biliary or extra-biliary origin.\n\n【5】 ## Coagulation tests (e.g. INR)\nThe liver is responsible for the production of coagulation factors. The international normalized ratio (INR) measures the speed of a particular pathway of coagulation, comparing it to normal. If the INR is increased, it means it is taking longer than usual for blood to clot.  The INR will only be increased if the liver is so damaged that synthesis of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors has been impaired: it is not a sensitive measure of liver function.\nIt is very important to normalize the INR before operating on people with liver problems (usually by transfusion with blood plasma containing the deficient factors) as they could bleed excessively out.\n\n【6】 ## Serum glucose (BG, Glu)\nThe liver's ability to produce glucose (gluconeogenesis) is usually the last function to be lost in the setting of fulminant liver failure.\n\n【7】 ## Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)\nLactate dehydrogenase is an enzyme found in many body tissues, including the liver.

Dominant lethal mutation tests in mice showed no mutagenicity at single doses as high as 640 mg/kg (18 times the human dose, based on mg/m2). Neither the spermatocyte test, the F1 translocation test, nor the Ames test indicated mutagenic properties. Doses up to 40 mg/kg in mice (equal to the human dose, based on mg/m2), given to males for 60 days and to females for 14 days prior to gestation, had no effect upon fetuses and offspring, though there was slight maternal toxicity.\n\n【6】 ### Pregnancy Category: C\nTeratogenic Effects\nMebendazole has shown embryotoxic and teratogenic activity in pregnant rats at single oral doses as low as 10 mg/kg (approximately equal to the human dose, based on mg/m2). In view of these findings the use of mebendazole is not recommended in pregnant women. Although there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women, a postmarketing survey has been done of a limited number of women who inadvertently had consumed mebendazole during the first trimester of pregnancy.

In 170 deliveries on term, no teratogenic risk of mebendazole was identified.\n\n【7】 ### Nursing Mothers\nIt is not known whether mebendazole is excreted in human milk.

For people who cannot cough deeply enough to produce a sample, a suction tube or needle may be inserted in the airway to collect the sputum.\nIn a hospital setting, a sputum culture is most commonly ordered if a patient has a pneumonia.  The Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends that sputum cultures be done in pneumonia requiring hospitalization, while the American College of Chest Physicians does not.

However, our analyses of strategies that did not use any maintenance systemic therapy did not demonstrate any statistically significant detriment in overall survival. Therefore, this approach may be preferred by patients, as it offers them a complete break from treatment. - All but one of the intermittent strategies offered 12 to 18 weeks of induction treatment and were monitored with imaging at least every 8 to 12 weeks during the intermittent phase of treatment, with reintroduction of the induction chemotherapy at disease progression. These represent reasonable guidelines to consider when using an intermittent strategy, but adaptation of a strategy to individual circumstances should always be considered. A longer induction period or closer clinical monitoring of patients on maintenance therapy or chemotherapy-free interval might be appropriate for patients with very bulky or symptomatic disease. For some patients like this, an intermittent strategy may not be appropriate. - Five of the seven trials that contributed to the meta-analyses were based on treatments with FOLFOX chemotherapy, one of the commonly used first-line chemotherapy regimens for mCRC in Ontario. The other two trials included in the meta-analyses used fluoropyrimidine monotherapy or FOLFIRI as induction chemotherapy regimens. Given the acceptability of fluoropyrimidine monotherapy as one of the options for first-line therapy  and the accepted equivalence of FOLFIRI and FOLFOX as first-line therapies , extrapolation of our conclusions to all commonly used induction chemotherapy regimens is reasonable. - During maintenance therapy or a chemotherapy-free interval, best supportive care should be continued for patients.\n\n【5】 #FUTURE RESEARCH\nFuture research should include a population study to evaluate the impact of intermittent strategies of administering first-line therapy for mCRC on outcomes in routine practice.\n\n【6】 #RELATED GUIDELINES\n- PEBC Evidence-based Series\nThe PEBC is a provincial initiative of Cancer Care Ontario supported by the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care.

Permits shall be signed by an authorized employer representative certifying that preparation of the confined space, precautionary measures, and personal protective equipment are adequate, and that precautions have been taken to ensure that the prescribed procedures will be followed.\nConfined spaces which have contained epichlorohydrin shall be inspected and tested for oxygen deficiency, epichlorohydrin, and other contaminants, and, prior to entry by the employee, they shall be thoroughly ventilated, cleaned, and washed.\nInadvertent entry of epichlorohydrin into the confined space while work is in progress shall be prevented by disconnecting and blocking of epichlorohydrin supply lines or by other appropriate means.\nIndividuals entering confined spaces where they may be exposed to epichlorohydrin shall wear either a combination Type C suppliedair respirator operated in the continuous-flow (positive pressure) mode or an auxiliary breathing air supply operated in the pressure-demand (positive pressure) mode equipped with a full facepiece, or a self-contained breathing apparatus operated in the pressure-demand (positive pressure) mode.\nEach individual shall also wear a suitable harness with lifelines tended by another employee outside the space who shall also be equipped with the necessary protective equipment, including a self-contained breathing apparatus which operates in the pressure-demand (positive pressure) mode and has a full facepiece.

Epichlorohydrin has a greater tendency to react with more readily polarized groups, such as sulfhydryl groups, than with less readily polarized groups, such as hydroxyls.\nThe half-life of epichlorohydrin in water at a pH of 7 is 36.3 hours.  Although the half-life of epichlorohydrin in biologic tissues is not known, the known presence of large numbers of nucleophiles in tissue suggests that it is shorter than the half-life in water. Mammalian enzymes which catalyze the hydrolysis of epichlorohydrin, or otherwise degrade it, would further decrease the biologic half-life. Under hypothetical, constant, nonlethal exposure conditions, a steady-state concentration of epichlorohydrin would eventually be achieved in all tissues, resulting in a steady-state rate of alkylation of tissue constituents. For reviews of the pertinent literature, the reader is referred to Ross  and Loveless.  Extent of Exposure Epichlorohydrin is commercially synthesized from allyl chloride,  allyl alcohol,  dichlorhydrin-glycerine,  or propylene.\nThe total US production of epichlorohydrin was about 550 million pounds in 19\nProjected expansion plans, if accomplished, would increase total production to 715 million pounds by 1978.  In 1969, the total US production of crude epichlorohydrin was about 322 million pounds.  An estimated 58% of this was used in the manufacture of synthetic glycerine and 42% was processed to refined epichlorohydrin.  Refined epichlorohydrin is used in the manufacture\nA number of cases of dermal sensitization have been reported in workers in the epoxy resin-producing and resin-using industries.  Attempts to identify the causative agents have been only partially They felt that specific work practices were necessary since epichlorohydrin penetrates rubber and leather. They noted that there was a latent period of several minutes to several hours between contact with epichlorohydrin and its manifestations.\nIn 1966, Pet'ko et al  investigated the health of workers engaged in the production of epichlorohydrin from dichlorhydrin glycerine (DCG) in Russia. Environmental monitoring for both epichlorohydrin and DCG was done by an unspecified sampling method. In some instances, the epichlorohydrin concentration in air was reported to be 2-14 times greater than its maximum Although the authors considered the individual worker's length of service to be unrelated to the nature and frequency of the complaints, they did not report the nature of the complaints. They concluded that no deviations from the normal which could be interpreted in terms of occupational factors, other than two cases of occupational dermatitis, were identifiable. The dermatitis cases were not discussed. Pet'ko et al  recommended that further studies be done, and that annual medical examinations by an internist, a dermatologist, and a neuropathologist be given. The authors gave no explanation for including a neuropathologist, nor did they specify the clinical basis for recommending blood and urine examinations. With Fregert as the subject, the authors found that, following application for 2 days of patches containing epichlorohydrin diluted to 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0% with ethanol, no immediate effects on the skin were visible, but reactions developed after 8-11 days at all test sites.\nRetesting with 0.1 and 0.01% epichlorohydrin induced a positive reaction after 2 days to 0.1% epichlorohydrin and resulted in erythema with 0.01% epichlorohydrin.\nPropene oxide, 0.2% in ethanol, gave a positive reaction when it was applied to skin previously exposed to epichlorohydrin.\nNegative reactions were obtained with 1-chloropropane (1%), l-chloro-2propanol (1%), and ethylene oxide (1%) after application of these compounds to areas where epichlorohydrin had been applied\nIn addition, the method by which the epichlorohydrin concentrations were measured or verified was not reported.\nIn the absence of such information, it is reasonable to assume that these observations are derived from accidental occupational exposures to epichlorohydrin\nIn the majority of the 48 cases, the deviations from normal ranges were no longer detectable after a few months.\nFrom the available data, it is not possible to attribute these persistent changes solely to epichlorohydrin exposure. The most frequently observed deviations from the normal ranges were a decrease in the percentage of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and an increase in the percentage of monocytes in the total leukocytes count of the blood; even these changes were not consistent in any employee These all illnesses during epichlorohydrin exposure were respiratory and only 24 (27%) were respiratory during nonexposure to epichlorohydrin. The consultants concluded that illness during employment in an epichlorohydrinexposure area is more likely to be respiratory than one during employment elsewhere.\nExamination of the ECG revealed that 5.0% of the employees in the minimal-exposure group and 2.7% in the moderate-exposure group had abnormal records.\nThe consultants concluded that epichlorohydrin exposure had not influenced the ECG records.\nStudy of pulmonary roentgenograms indicated that, in both the moderate-and minimal-exposure groups, 1.8% contained abnormal findings, such as emphysematous blebs, mild pneumonic infiltration, pneumonia, mild chronic pulmonary fibrosis, minor emphysema, and infiltrative lesions. The consultants noted that, in addition to the same frequency of abnormal X-radiographs in both exposure groups, a rate of 1.8% did not appear to be greater than that which might be expected in similar unexposed workers.\nThe urinalysis showed no clear difference between the two exposure groups or any group tendency toward abnormality. Hematocrit index, lymphocyte count, SGOT and SGPT activities, and creatinine and BUN values were within the normal range. White blood cell counts were above the normal limit during the 4th, 8th, and 12th years of employment for the moderate-exposure group.\nThis study, although helpful, is inadequate to fully estimate the health hazards associated with epichlorohydrin exposure for several reasons.\nThe data base comprises a group of employees occupationally exposed to epichlorohydrin for periods of 6 months-16 years, but no consideration was given to those who dropped out because of illness, retirement, or death. There is no way to evaluate from this study the importance of the group lost from the observation. A major deficiency of this study is the lack of a control group. In the absence of such a group, the \"normal\" range of the clinical and the biochemical tests is dependent on laboratory values alone. Further, because of the lack of controls, the consultants compared the effects of the moderate-exposure group with those of the minimal-exposure group. The consultants stated that the measure of exposure was \"a crude one\" and that it was only an estimate by the company of whether a given individual's exposure was minimal or moderate. No quantitative data with regard to exposure were provided, and there is no indication of even what range of concentration was referred to by the classifications \"moderate\" and \"minimal.\" Therefore, any absence of doserelated effects could be accounted for both by the absence of a clear distinction between the groups and by loss of an affected segment of population. From the biochemical data, it is possible to conclude that groups of individuals \"exposed\" to epichlorohydrin do not show variations from the measured norms held to be appropriate by the laboratory If the number of tests in any year of employment was related to the number, of employees, the length of employment in the moderate-exposure group was much shorter than in the minimal-exposure group, ie, less than half the workers were still employed during the 1st year and available for tests.\nUrinary protein excretion, hemoglobin concentrations in blood, and differential cell counts were normal.\nMicroscopic examination showed only an abscess in one lung, which the author did not attribute to epichlorohydrin exposure.\nRats exposed to epichlorohydrin vapor at 27 ppm for 18 days (approximately 417 mg/kg total amount inhaled) showed mild nasal irritation.\n\n【13】 #Gage\nalso exposed two groups of two rabbits each to epichlorohydrin vapor. The periods of exposure were not mentioned, but probably, like the rats, the rabbits were exposed 6 hours/day, 5 days/week.\nThe first group was exposed for 20 daily periods at 35 ppm (approximately 439 mg/kg total amount inhaled). The second group was exposed for two periods at 16 ppm (approximately 20 mg/kg total amount inhaled). The latter exposure was reduced to 9 ppm and was continued for 20 more days (approximately 113 mg/kg total amount inhaled). Thus, the second group of rabbits is estimated to have inhaled a total amount of 133 mg/kg.\nInhalation of epichlorohydrin at 35 or 16 ppm produced nasal irritation.\n\n【14】 In 1961, Kremneva and Tolgskaya  reported the effects of epichlorohydrin on mice, rats, and rabbits. Routes of administration were stomach intubation, subcutaneous injection, inhalation, and skin and eye application. Three groups of 10 mice and 5 rats each were administered aqueous solutions of epichlorohydrin by stomach tube in doses of 500, 325, and 250 mg/kg. All animals given doses of 500 or 325 mg/kg died within the first 2 days. In both rats and mice, the same type of intoxication pattern was evident: low mobility, slow and labored breathing, hyperemia of the skin, subcutaneous bleeding, ataxia, periodic body tremor, and distention of the abdomen. Microscopic examination of tissues of the dead animals revealed plethora of the internal organs, hemorrhage and edema of the lungs and pulmonary tissue, vacuolization of the liver cells with what was described as fatty degeneration, and degenerative processes in the epithelium of the convoluted tubules accompanied by some necrosis in the kidneys.\nFoci of necrosis in the stomach and intestinal mucosa also were observed. At the 250-mg/kg dose, no visible signs of intoxication were evident during the 14-day observation period.\nA total of 50 mice were injected with epichlorohydrin at doses of 500, 375, 250, and 125 mg/kg.  The results of the injections were not described except that, at doses of 500 and 375 mg/kg, all of the mice died, and, at 250 mg/kg, 7 of 10 mice died. Epichlorohydrin at a dose of 125 mg/kg was tolerated without visible alteration in the behavior of the mice. To assess the irritant effects on eyes, 0.1 ml of epichlorohydrin solution in cottonseed oil was instilled into the right eyes of the rabbits; the left eyes served as the untreated controls.\nThe eyes were examined every 30 minutes for 3 hours. Corneal damage was present in 80% of the animals and a lesser degree of irritation occurred in the rest of the animals. Epichlorohydrin was found to be a strong ophthalmic irritant.\nThere was no evidence of sensitization to epichlorohydrin, as determined by the maximization test in 5 Hartley-strain guinea pigs.\nGroups of 12 male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected ip daily for 30 consecutive days with 0.00955 or 0.01910 ml/kg of epichlorohydrin or 0.01910 ml/kg of cottonseed oil. At the end of 30 days, hemoglobin values were increased significantly at the low dose but decreased significantly at the higher dose (P values less than or equal to 0.05). The concentration of neutrophilic metamyelocytes increased significantly (P value less than or equal to 0.05) in the high-dose group but remained equal to that of controls for the rats administered epichlorohydrin at the lower dose.\nLymphocytes showed an insignificant dose-related decrease in frequency. A slight, insignificant dose-related increase in clotting time was also observed. Hepatic function, as measured by the BSP test, was not impaired.\nThe heart-to-body weight ratio increased in a dose-related way but the increases were not statistically significant. The ratio of the weight of the kidney to body weight increased significantly with both doses (P value less than or equal to 0.05). The ratio of brain-to-body weight of the rats was higher in the epichlorohydrin-treated rats than in the controls.\nMicroscopic examination did not reveal changes in any organs except in the lungs. Lesions in the lungs were evident in all groups, but the incidence and severity were \"somewhat greater\" in the treated animals than in the controls. It is noteworthy that the authors did not detect any kidney damage in the microscopic examination. All animals treated with epichlorohydrin had lower hematocrit and erythrocyte counts than the control rats, but this was significant (P value less than or equal to 0.05) only for the hematocrit value of the middle-dose group. An increase in the concentration of platelets in the blood also was observed in the epichlorohydrin-treated animals. Total leukocyte counts were lower in the low-dose group and higher in the highest-dose group than in the control group. These differences were not significant (P value less than or equal to 0.05). Leukocyte counts for the middle-dose and control groups were the same. A dose-related increase in the average percentage of segmented neutrophils was observed but was significant (P value less than or equal to 0.01) only for the high-dose group. The percentage of eosinophils increased in all experimental groups, the increases in the low-and the high-dose groups being significant (P value less than or equal to 0.05).\nSignificant reductions in the percentage of lymphocyte in the total leukocyte count were observed in the animals treated with the two highest doses (P values less than or equal to 0.05 and 0.01, respectively). The ratio of the weight of the brain to that of the body was significantly lower (P value less than or equal to 0.01) in the animals treated with epichlorohydrin at the highest dose than in the control animals; this is in contrast to the effect obtained in animals receiving 30 daily doses of epichlorohydrin.\nThe effect of epichlorohydrin on pentobarbital-induced sleeping time was studied in mice.\nMale ICR-strain mice in groups of 10 were administered 1/10, 1/5, or 1/2 of the acute ip LD50 dose (0.14 ml/kg) of epichlorohydrin. Control mice were administered ip saline injections.\nSimilar groups of mice were exposed to epichlorohydrin vapor at 1/10, 1/5, or 1/2 of the LT50 dose (71.89 mg/liter, 9.13 minutes). Control mice were placed in an inhalation chamber and were exposed to uncontaminated air.\nTwenty-four hours after exposure to epichlorohydrin by either route, 50 mg/kg of sodium pentobarbital was administered ip. A dose-related increase in sleeping time was observed in all the epichlorohydrin-treated animals;\nhowever, the only significant increases (P value less than or equal to 0.01) were in the groups receiving the highest ip dose or the highest inhalation exposure. Based on these extensive studies, it can be concluded that epichlorohydrin is severely irritating to the skin and the eyes, and perhaps to the lungs. Further, it also affects some metabolic processes of the liver. In most cases, the severity of its effects appears to be dose dependent.\nIn 1972, Lawrence and Autian Severe lesions of the neurons in the medulla oblongata, Ammon's horn, and cerebellum were also present.\nAnimals inhaling epichlorohydrin at 0.5 ppm showed an increase in leukocytes with altered fluorescence, a decrease in the nucleic acid content of the blood, but no significant effects on the amount of urinary coproporphyrin.\nBased on the results of this continuous inhalation study, Fomin  recommended that the mean diurnal maximum permissible concentration of epichlorohydrin in the atmosphere not exceed 0.2 mg/cu m (approximately 0.05 ppm). The exposure in this study was continuous and the effect of intermittent recovery periods was not evaluated.\nIn 1969, Golubev  recorded changes in the diameters of the pupils of the eyes of rabbits. Groups of six rabbits were used to ascertain the irritating effects of eight different chemicals, including epichlorohydrin.\nThe rabbits' eyes were illuminated with a uniform reflected light, and the diameters of the pupils were measured with an instrument referred to as a tangential pupilometer. A 0.25 M solution of epichlorohydrin was instilled into the conjunctival sacs and the pupil diameters were measured 1, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 minutes later. In the control rabbits, the pupil diameters were measured both before instillation and at similar time intervals after instillation of 0.05 ml of saline solution into the conjunctival sacs.\nEpichlorohydrin caused constriction ranging from 1 to 16% during the first 20 minutes, the initial diameter being considered 100%. The author noted that this effect was elicited at an epichlorohydrin concentration that caused no visible changes in the conjunctivae or cornea.\nThus, epichlorohydrin at 0.25 M (2.3%) has a measurable effect on the eyes.\nPrior to injection, the urine of each animal was examined for protein, potassium, and sodium; thus, each animal served as its own control. The animals were kept in metabolism cages; their urines were examined 1, 2, 3, and 8 days after epichlorohydrin administration.\nOliguria or anuria was exhibited by 53 (79%) animals and polyuria by 4 (6%). The remaining 10 (15%) produced urine at normal rates.\nOf the 53 rats that produced little or no urine during the period immediately after the administration of epichlorohydrin, 7 (13.2%) entered a stage of polyuria within 2-3 days after the administration of the dose.\nThe mortality rate was 13.4%, death occurring only among the oliguric and anuric animals. Pallade et al  noted that proteinuria and the parallel oliguric and anuric conditions indicated the occurrence of renal damage. If tissue repair and regeneration had occurred, the animals survived. They concluded that the signs of renal disorders confirmed that epichlorohydrin is nephrotoxic to rats. Therefore, medical examinations oriented to the detection of renal disorders were recommended for workers exposed to epichlorohydrin. Information on how epichlorohydrin vapor was generated and information on the size of the chamber were not provided. Neither was it indicated whether the chamber was operated in the static or the dynamic mode. The total amounts of epichlorohydrin inhaled during each of the 4-hour exposure periods are estimated to have been approximately 51, 2.9, and 1.0 mg/kg, respectively.\nThe same effects seen in the previous experiment  were observed.\nIn addition, the weights of the liver and kidneys were increased, whereas those of the lungs and the spleen were decreased.\nRemoval of BSP from blood was decreased on the day of exposure, but not reliably on the day after the exposure. The production of urine was increased by all three levels of exposure, with concomitant decreases in the specific gravity of the urine. The daily output of chlorides in the urine on the day after exposure was usually increased by a larger factor than the production of urine. The daily excretion of protein in the urine was also increased, but less than that of chlorides. No additional studies of pulmonary and splenic function were reported. Reductions in both oxygen consumption and body temperature also were observed.\nA significant (P value not given) stimulating influence on the mobility of spermatozoa also Renal cytochrome oxidase activity was determined in 14 rats and in 10 controls 24 hours after they had been injected with epichlorohydrin.  Statistically significant (P value less than or equal to 0.01) inhibitions were observed in treated animals. Renal succinic dehydrogenase activity, determined 24 hours after epichlorohydrin administration, was similar for 10 experimental and 6 control animals. Examination of 40 treated and 30 control rats showed reductions in renal carbonic anhydrase activity of 6-11% 24 hours after the administration of epichlorohydrin. This reduction was not statistically significant. Glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (GPT) (E.C. 2.6.1.2) activity was measured 2.5 and 24 hours after administration in both renal tissue and serum. There were 30 animals in the group examined at 2.5 hours after epichlorohydrin administration and 40 in the group examined 24 hours postdose. At 2.5 hours, no change was observed in the kidneys, but a statistically significant (P value less than or equal to 0.01) increase in SGPT activity was observed at both the 2.5-hour and the 24-hour intervals. A significant reduction (P value less than or equal to 0.01) was observed at 24 hours; there were 0.230 units of activity in the controls in contrast to 0.100 units in the experimental group. The average SGPT activity in the experimental group ranged from 0.051 ± 0.022 units at 2.5 hours to 0.058 ± 0.018 units at 24 hours, in contrast to the control group average of 0.034 ± 0.010 units. Glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT; E.C. 2.6.1.1) activities in the kidney were similar for the controls and the intoxicated animals at 2.5 hours, but significantly (P values less than or equal to 0.01) different at 24 hours in the experimental rats (0.261 ± 0.046 units) versus 0.302 ± 0.040 units in the controls. SGOT activity was significantly increased in the experimental rats, 0.045 ± 0.009 units at 2.5 hours (P value less than or equal to 0.02) and 0.046 ± 0.010 units at 24 hours, (P value less than or equal to 0.01) in contrast to 0.040 ± 0.008 units observed in the controls. Alkaline phosphatase activity was assayed in 30 experimental animals and in 30 controls. The animals given epichlorohydrin showed a significant reduction (P value less than or equal to 0.01) in the mean kidney phosphatase activities (0.029 ± 0.008 units) at 2.5 hours but had a mean alkaline phosphatase activity comparable with that in the controls (0.033 ± 0.014 units) at 24 hours.\nHowever, serum alkaline phosphatase activity decreased progressively at 11-day period had no effect on body weight. Inhalation exposure at a concentration of 0.6 mg/liter of epichlorohydrin for 4 hours/day for eight times during 11 days decreased body weight by about 9%. Combination of these two exposures, that to heat following immediately after that to epichlorohydrin, had the same effect on body weight as exposure to the chemical alone. This finding agrees with that relating to the LC50. In conclusion, the amount of heat stress had no effect on these two responses of rodents to epichlorohydrin. Despite these two negative findings, there were a few instances in which addition of heat stress seemed to modify toxic actions by the chemical stressor. Thus, rats exposed to both heat and epichlorohydrin were reported to have had somewhat less marked alterations of the structure of the liver and the thyroid follicles, but more pronounced ones of the adrenal medulla, than those exposed to epichlorohydrin alone. Five rats showed moderate accumulations, resembling abscesses in some instances, of leukocytes around blood vessels in the interstitial tissue of the thyroid. A dose of 150 mg/kg of epichlorohydrin was administered to 10 male mice by ip injection. Each male was then caged with three undosed virgin female mice for 1 week. The females were replaced each week for 8 weeks and then killed and examined for pregnancy. The numbers of total live implants, early fetal deaths, and late fetal deaths were recorded. Since, in general, late fetal deaths were exceedingly rare, total implants and early fetal deaths were the only features of pregnancy analyzed. The authors did not report the observation of any effects of epichlorohydrin on early fetal deaths or other reproductive characteristics, including male fertility.\n\n【15】 A group of female ICR/Ha mice had 2.0 mg of epichlorohydrin in 0.1 ml of acetone applied to the skin followed 2 weeks later by three applications each week, and throughout the study (total duration, 385 days), of 2.5 jug of phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), a promoter, in 0.1 ml of acetone.\nIn the group of 50 mice to which epichlorohydrin was applied, nine mice developed papillomas and one a carcinoma. Control animals to which solvent  alone or no chemical  was applied produced no tumors. Of the mice to which PMA alone  was applied, three developed papillomas.\nFor an assay by subcutaneous injection, 50 mice were injected weekly in the left flank with 1.0 mg of epichlorohydrin in 0.05 ml of tricaprylin.\nThis test also lasted for 580 days.\nOf the animals given epichlorohydrin, six developed sarcomas and one an adenocarcinoma (P value less than or equal to 0.05). In comparison, 1 mouse of 50 injected with tricaprylin alone developed sarcoma, and none of the control animals developed any tumors. The significance of subcutaneous sarcomas which occur at the injection site has been discussed by Grasso and Golberg.  In an ip assay, 30 mice received weekly injections into the lower abdomen of 1.0 mg of epichlorohydrin in 0.05 ml of tricaprylin. The experiment was terminated after 450 days. None of the mice developed local sarcomas, but 11 had papillary lung tumors. Of mice given tricaprylin alone, 10 had papillary tumors of the lungs and 1 developed a local sarcoma.\nReports of experimental attempts to induce the formation of terata by exposing pregnant female animals to epichlorohydrin have not been found. Sampling was conducted with charcoal tubes using a calibrated, battery-operated pump. Quintuplicate samples were taken for each job classification at a rate of 2 liters/minute for 7 hours. Epichlorohydrin and chlorinated hydrocarbons were extracted with 30 ml of carbon disulfide.\nshowed the average epichlorohydrin concentration to be 0.03 ppm.\nIn the same year, 78 grab samples indicated that epichlorohydrin concentrations ranged from 13 ppm to less than 0.60 ppm, with an average of 3.17 ppm. It should be noted that the \"average\" was a numerical average between the individual samples,-not the TWA concentrations.\nPet'ko et al  reported the results of environmental monitoring done in epichlorohydrin and dichlorhydrin-glycerine production units in Russia. The sampling technique employed was not specified. Concentrations  Data on collection efficiency were not given. However, sampling with silica gel in high humidity may result in considerable sample loss from the displacement of the organic vapors by water vapor. Whitman and Johnston  reported that this problem could be overcome with a molecular sieve prefilter. They used a 5-Angstrom molecular sieve to remove water vapor from gas streams without interfering with the passage of aromatic hydrocarbons. White et al  have described the design of activated charcoal tubes suitable for sampling, and such tubes are commercially available. Adsorption on activated charcoal is the preferred sampling method for epichlorohydrin alone for several reasons: epichlorohydrin is not displaced by water vapor as it is from silica gel; it is a simpler, more convenient procedure than the use of plastic bags or of a bubbler; it uses a small, portable sampling device, and the difficulties associated with handling liquids are eliminated.\nVarious methods used for analyzing the collected samples have included colorimetry,  infrared analysis,  and gas chromatography.  Colorimetric analysis suitable for analyzing epichlorohydrin in an aqueous solution has been used.\nFormaldehyde, or any substance that may yield formaldehyde under the test conditions, will interfere. Compounds that contain or would form vicinal terminal hydroxy groups, such as ethylene glycol and ethylene oxide, will also interfere.\nA colorimetric method  suitable for analyzing epichlorohydrin collected in sulfuric acid also has been used.\nAir containing epichlorohydrin was drawn through two bubblers containing 3 ml of 20% sulfuric acid and 4 ml of 10% sulfuric acid, respectively. The content of the first bubbler was diluted 1:1 with water. A 3-ml sample was then oxidized with 0.5 ml of 3% potassium iodate solution and allowed to stand for 30 minutes, during which time a yellow color developed. A 10% sodium sulfite solution was added and the mixture was shaken until the color disappeared.\nOne milliliter of Schiff's reagent was then added and the intensity of the resulting color (magenta) was measured 1 hour later. The initial reactions occurring were similar to those in the previously discussed colorimetric method.\nEpichlorohydrin is hydrolyzed by sulfuric acid and the resulting glycol is oxidized to formaldehyde by the iodate. The formaldehyde then reacts with Schiff's reagent to form a magenta complex.\nSodium sulfite is added to reduce the unreacted iodate.\nIt was found that this method was capable of analyzing 0.01-0.1 mg epichlorohydrin in a 6-ml solution. Data on sensitivity, specificity, and interferences were not reported. However, the same compounds that would interfere with the previously discussed colorimetric technique,  such as ethylene oxide and ethylene glycol, would also interfere with this method. In addition, many aldehydes would interfere.\nThe formaldehyde can also react with phenylhydrazlne hydrochloride to form phenylhydrazone.\nIn recent years, gas chromatography has become the method of choice of most investigators for separation and the analysis of organic materials.\nIt offers excellent specificity and sensitivity and is suitable for analyzing samples of airborne contaminants collected on charcoal.\nInterferences are few, and most of those which do occur can be eliminated by altering the instrumental conditions. Muganlinsky et al  developed a linear temperature program to analyze epichlorohydrin in the presence of chlorinated hydrocarbons which may be present as impurities.\nSampling involves the collection of personal samples on charcoal tubes, and analysis involves desorption with carbon disulfide and measurement with a gas chromatograph equipped with a suitable detector. Such a notation refers to the potential contribution to overall exposure by the cutaneous route, including mucous membranes and eyes, either by airborne or, more particularly, by direct skin contact with liquid epichlorohydrin. This designation is intended to indicate the need for appropriate measures for the prevention of cutaneous absorption so that the TLV is not invalidated.\nThe present federal standard (29 CFR 1910.1000) for occupational exposure to epichlorohydrin is 5 ppm as an 8-hour TWA limit. This standard was based on the ACGIH TLV.\nIn Russia and in France, the maximum allowable concentration (MAC) in the industrial environment is 1 mg/cu m (0.26 ppm).  In the Rumanian Socialist Republic, 10 mg/cu m (approximately 2.6 ppm) of epichlorohydrin is the maximum concentration allowed in the occupational environment.  In the Federal Republic of Germany, the permissible environmental exposure limit is 18 mg/cu m (approximately 3.6 ppm), and 5 mg/cu m (approximately 1 ppm) in the German Democratic Republic.  The bases for these standards are not given. Air and water quality standards have not been found, although one recommendation of such a value (0.2 mg/cu m) has been presented.\nBasis for the Recommended Standard\nSince acute effects have been observed on humans at 20 ppm, and the lowest concentration which induces effects during a short interval has not been identified, a ceiling concentration of 19 mg/cu m (5 ppm), based on professional judgment, is recommended to protect even the more sensitive fraction of the working population from these adverse effects.\nThe existing federal standard of 5 ppm is based on the 1968 TLV.\nFurther information on cumulative aspects of toxicity such as sterility, carcinogenesis, and mutagenesis have been reported in subsequent studies.\nThe minimal concentration which has been observed to induce effects on rats (about 5 ppm) is used to approximate the permissible exposure in the occupational environment by weighing additional risk factors. The chronic effects for which risk must be considered are carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, and antifertility, as well as liver, kidney, and lung damage.\nVan Duuren et al  found that a single application of 2.0 mg of epichlorohydrin on mouse skin initiated the tumorigenic process in at least 9 of the 30 experimental mice when it was followed by triweekly The total risk to the health of employees occupationally exposed to epichlorohydrin is the result of the independent risks due to carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, sterility, and damage to kidneys, liver, respiratory tract, and to the skin. At present, evidence for the existence of the risks, other than to skin depends primarily on data from experimental animal models. Concern for employee health requires that the probability of the occurrence of chronic effects be minimized. NIOSH recommends, therefore, that worker exposure to epichlorohydrin be limited to a concentration of 2 mg/cu m (0.5 ppm) as a TWA concentration. This value has been chosen on the basis of professional judgment, rather than on quantitative data which clearly distinguish no-effect concentrations from those at which adverse effects have been shown to occur in human populations.\nA TWA concentration of 2 mg/cu m of epichlorohydrin should protect the employee against injury to organs during the individual's working lifetime, according to existing information. However, additional research is needed to provide support for the recommended environmental limit or to indicate the need for a different limit. The environmental limit implicitly assumes that the absorbed epichlorohydrin molecules will be detoxified by biochemical mechanisms, thereby reducing the risk of induction of human disease resulting from the cumulative toxicity of epichlorohydrin.\nIt is recognized that many employees handle small amounts of epichlorohydrin or work in situations where, regardless of the amount used, there is only negligible contact with epichlorohydrin.\nUnder these conditions, it should not be necessary to comply with all of the provisions of the recommended standard, which has been prepared primarily to protect employee health under all circumstances. For these reasons, \"occupational exposure to epichlorohydrin\" is defined as exposure above one-half the TWA environmental limit, thereby delineating those work situations which do not require the expenditure of resources for environmental monitoring and associated recordkeeping. Because of nonrespiratory hazards such as the production of burns on the skin in the use of epichlorohydrin, NIOSH recommends that appropriate work practices and protective measures to limit such contact be required regardless of the concentration of airborne epichlorohydrin. Further, the observation of changes in the concentration of biochemical constituents  following human and animal exposure to epichlorohydrin suggest that the health of the exposed workers be monitored frequently. Thus, it is recommended that comprehensive medical examinations be offered to all employees subject to occupational exposure to epichlorohydrin and that the responsible physician consider the advisability of also administering any liver and kidney function tests.\n\n【16】 #VI. WORK PRACTICES\nWork practices must be designed to minimize or to prevent inhalation of epichlorohydrin and skin and eyes from coming into contact with epichlorohydrin. Good work practices are a primary means of controlling certain exposures and will often supplement other control measures.\nEnclosure of materials, processes, and operations is completely effective as a control only when the integrity of the system is maintained.\nSuch systems should be inspected frequently for leaks and any leaks found should be promptly repaired.\nSince the penetration time is dependent on both the type of the rubber and the thickness, it is noteworthy that in this test  the thickness for each type of rubber was: 0.015 inches for nitrile rubber, 0.02 inches for neoprene rubber, and 0.030 inches for natural rubber.\n\n【17】 #Mutagenic Effect\nThis effect must be systematically investigated in greater depth with respect to dose, time, and route in both lower organisms and mammals.\nAnimal tests using various doses, schedules, and routes of administration should be performed to see whether epichlorohydrin is a mutagen in mammals.\nSpecific locus tests or heritable translocations should be considered.\nAnimals should also be tested to see whether epichlorohydrin has any cytogenic effects.\n\n【18】 #Kidney Function in Workers Exposed to Epichlorohydrin\nThe impairment of kidney function as a result of epichlorohydrin exposure has been found in animals. As yet, there is no evidence that such injury also occurs in workers exposed to epichlorohydrin. Since a segment of a working population which is exposed primarily to epichlorohydrin can be identified, kidney function tests should be given periodically to determine whether any changes in kidney function are occurring as a result of occupational exposure to epichlorohydrin.\n\n【19】 #Skin Sensitization\nAlthough epichlorohydrin is commonly stated to be a sensitizer of the skin, the data that have been found in this regard are far from complete or persuasive Some measure of variability in the skin response would be most useful.\n\n【20】 #Electroencephalographic (EEG) Studies\nThe index of effect by epichlorohydrin on humans that seems to be the most sensitive on the basis of the available information is a change in the voltage of the alpha rhythm of the EEG.\nCollect enough samples to permit calculation of a TWA exposure for every operation or location in which there is exposure to epichlorohydrin.\n\n【21】 #(a) Equipment\nThe sampling train consists of a charcoal tube and a vacuum pump.\n\n【22】 Break the tips of a charcoal tube to produce openings of at least 2 mm in diameter.\nRepeat the procedure in  above at least three times, average the results and calculate the flowrate by dividing the volume between the preselected marks by the time required for the soapbubble to traverse the distance. If, for the pump being calibrated, the volume of air sampled is calculated as the product of the number of strokes times a stroke factor (given in units of volume/stroke), the stroke factor is the quotient of the volume between the two preselected marks divided by the number of strokes.\n\n【23】 #Determination of Desorption Efficiency\nThe desorption efficiency of a particular compound can vary from one laboratory to another and also from one batch of charcoal to another. Chemical substances should be listed according to their complete name derived from a recognized system of nomenclature.\nWhere possible, avoid using common names and general class names such as \"aromatic amine,\"\n\"safety solvent,\" or \"aliphatic hydrocarbon\" when the specific name is known.\nToxic hazard data shall be stated in terms of concentration, mode of exposure or test, and animal used, eg, \"100 ppm LC50-rat,\" \"25 mg/kg LD50-  The \"Health Hazard Data\" should be a combined estimate of the hazard of the total product. This can be expressed as a TWA concentration, as a permissible exposure, or by some other indication of an acceptable standard. Other data are acceptable, such as lowest LD50, if multiple components are involved.\nUnder \"Routes of Exposure,\" comments in each category should reflect the potential hazard from absorption by the route in question. Comments should indicate the severity of the effect and the basis for the statement, if possible. The basis might be animal studies, analogy with similar products, or human experiences. Comments such as \"yes\" or \"possible\" are not helpful. Typical comments might be:\nSkin Contact-causes delayed burns.\nEye Contact-some pain and transient irritation.\n\"Emergency and First Aid Procedures\" should be written in lay language and should primarily represent first-aid treatment that could be provided by paramedical personnel or individuals trained in first aid.\n\n【24】 Protective equipment must be specified as to type and materials of construction.\n\n【25】 #PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE C E N T E R F O R D I S E A S E C O N T R O L N A T I O N A L I N S T I T U T E F O R O C C U P A T I O N A L S A F E T Y A N D H E A L T H R O B E R T A.

Renal agenesis may be isolated or associated with other anomalies and syndromes. Renal agenesis is diagnosed with routine screening with fetal ultrasound. Patients with unilateral renal agenesis (URA) have an increased risk for proteinuria, hypertension, and renal insufficiency. The mortality rate of bilateral renal agenesis (BRA) without prenatal therapy with serial amnioinfusion is 100%, however, further studies are required to assess the outcome, risks, and benefits of serial amnioinfusion.\n\n【2】 #Classification\nRenal agenesis may be classified as unilateral renal agenesis(URA) or bilateral renal agenesis (BRA). URA is the congenital absence of one kidney and BRA is the congenital absence of both kidneys which is incompatible with life. Renal agenesis may be isolated or associated with other anomalies and syndromes.\n\n【3】 #Pathophysiology\nRenal agenesis results from the failure of the ureteric bud to form the ureter, renal pelvis and the collecting duct system and the failure of the renal mesenchyme to form nephrons.\n\n【4】 #Causes\nRenal agenesis may be associated with CAKUT (congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract) or extra-renal anomalies, genetic syndromes or chromosomal disorders, and sequences.\n\n【5】 #Epidemiology and Demographics\nThe general incidence of unilateral renal agenesis (URA) has been reported to be approximately 1 in 2031 individuals. Males are more commonly affected by unilateral renal agenesis (URA) than females. The incidence of bilateral renal agenesis (BRA) is approximately 1 in every 3000 pregnancies. The mortality rate of bilateral renal agenesis (BRA) without prenatal therapy is 100%.\n\n【6】 #Screening\nPrenatal screening with ultrasound during pregnancy is routinely performed and this has led to an increase in the diagnosis of unilateral renal agenesis (URA).\n\n【7】 Complications of unilateral renal agenesis (URA) may include signs of renal injury such as: hypertension, microalbuminuria and chronic kidney disease. Prognosis of bilateral renal agenesis (BRA) is extremely poor, and the mortality rate is 100% without prenatal therapy with serial amnioinfusion.\n\n【8】 ## History\nMaternal history during pregnancy for uncontrolled diabetes and treatment for hypertension may be important in unilateral renal disease (URA). Checking the family history of patients with URA for URA, CAKUT (congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract), end stage renal disease (ESRD), and consanguinity may be important.\n\n【9】 ## Symptoms and Physical Examination\nFollow up with checking of blood pressure (for hypertension) and urinalysis (for proteinuria and renal insufficiency) should be considered in patients with unilateral renal agenesis (URA). Checking for other contralateral congenital anomaly of kidney or urinary tract (CAKUT) such as VUR (vesicoureteral reflux) and PUJO (pelviureteric junction obstruction), extra-renal anomalies in different organs (such as cardiac, lung, gastrointestinal, genital, skeleton, and vertebral) , and associated syndromes and sequences (such as VACTERL, CHARGE and Trisomy 18) should be considered when URA is diagnosed.\n\n【10】 ## CT\nPostnatal abdominal CT scan  in patients with unilateral renal agenesis (URA) shows no renal parenchyma.\n\n【11】 ## MRI\nPrenatal MRI may be used for evaluating oligohydramnios, anhydramnios, fetal pulmonary hypoplasia and lung volumes. Postnatal MRI may be helpful in differentiating unilateral renal agenesis (URA) from multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK) or renal ectopia.\n\n【12】 ## Ultrasound\nRenal agenesis is diagnosed with routine screening with fetal ultrasound. Renal ultrasonography shows no renal parenchyma in unilateral renal agenesis (URA). Ultrasound findings in bilateral renal agenesis (BRA) may include: absence of fetal kidneys in the renal fossa, empty bladder and anhydramnios after 16 weeks of gestation. Absence of renal arteries on color doppler ultrasonography indicates bilateral renal agenesis (BRA) and may be used as an additive diagnostic tool.\n\n【13】 ## Other Imaging Findings\nPostnatal  renal scintigraphy in patients with unilateral renal agenesis (URA) shows no renal function and may be helpful in differentiating unilateral renal agenesis (URA) from multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK) or renal ectopia.\n\n【14】 ## Other Diagnostic Studies\nThere are no other diagnostic studies associated with renal agenesis.\n\n【15】 ## Medical Therapy and Surgery\nPatients with unilateral renal agenesis ,URA may progress to renal insufficiency that may progress to end stage renal disease (ESRD) and therefore may require medical treatment  or renal replacement therapy. Early diagnosis of unilateral renal agenesis (URA) and immediate intervention is helpful in controlling the progression to renal insufficiency.

Another common nickname is \"seccies\". A less common nickname is \"dolls\"; this was partly responsible for the title of Jacqueline Susann's novel Valley of the Dolls, whose main characters use secobarbital and other such drugs.\nAnother popular brand of barbiturate pill Tuinal contained a combination of secobarbital and amobarbital but is now rarely prescribed due to problems with abuse and overdose.\n\n【8】 ## Cause of Death of Charles Boyer\nTwo days after his wife died from cancer in 1978, Charles Boyer committed suicide with an overdose of Seconal.\n\n【9】 ## Cause of Death of Bartley Crum\nBartley Crum was the attorney for some of the so-called \"Hollywood Ten\" who were subpoenaed to appear before the House Un-American Activities Committee in 1947. The FBI tapped Crum's phones, opened his mail, and shadowed him constantly. Labeled as subversive, he ended up losing most of his clients and, unable to cope with stress from the harassment, committed suicide in 1959 by washing down an entire bottle of Seconal with whisky.\n\n【10】 ## Cause of Death of Judy Garland\nJudy Garland, of \"The Wizard of Oz\" fame, was found dead in her bathroom by her husband Mickey Deans on June 22, 1969. The stated exact cause of death by coroner Gavin Thursdon was accidental overdose of barbiturates; her blood contained the equivalent of 10 1.5-grain Seconal capsules.\n\n【11】 ## Role in Death of Jimi Hendrix\nSecobarbital played a role in the September 18, 1970 death of legendary rock guitarist Jimi Hendrix, who purportedly took nine Secobarbital tablets after a night of drinking wine and was later found dead in his London apartment.  Hendrix' death was caused by asphyxiation, after Hendrix presumably vomited in his sleep as a result of the mixture of the excessive Secobarbital dose and alcohol.\n\n【12】 ## Role in Death of Anissa Jones\n\n【13】 ## Cause of Death of Carol Landis\n\n【14】 ## Cause of Death of Marilyn Monroe\nIn March 2007, an LA-based Australian writer and director named Philippe Mora uncovered previously-classified government documents regarding Marilyn Monroe's death.

In the United States, gonorrhea is the second most common STD (after chlamydia).\nNeisseria gonorrhoeae is a species of Gram-negative, coffee bean-shaped diplococci bacteria responsible for the sexually transmitted infection gonorrhea.\nGonorrhea can infect mucus-secreting epithelial cells in both men and women.\nThe first place this bacterium infects is usually the columnar epithelium of the urethra and endocervix. Non-genital sites in which this bacterium thrives include the rectum, the oropharynx, and the conjunctivae of the eyes.\nEstablished routes of transmission of Neisseria gonorrhoeae include vaginal and rectal intercourse, fellatio, cunnilingus, and perinatal.\nIn pregnancy, gonococcus can be transmitted to the fetus at the time of delivery.\nAdditionally, development of disseminated gonococcal infection is the result of Neisserial organisms' dissemination to the blood.\nCommon risk factors in the development of gonorrhea include sexual activity, multiple sex partners, previous history of sexually transmitted diseases, having a sexual partner with a past history of any sexually transmitted disease, and failure to use condoms during sex.\nIn 50 to 70% of women, the initial infection with Neisseria gonorrhea may be asymptomatic. The most common complication of untreated gonorrhea is pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which may lead to increased risks of ectopic pregnancy. If left untreated, ectopic pregnancy can be life-threatening to the mother.\nEmpiric treatment for gonorrhea is usually initiated prior to receipt of laboratory results. Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) are the test of choice in all individuals who present with urogenital symptoms.\nThe mainstay of therapy for gonococcal infections is antimicrobial therapy. Gonorrhea treatment is complicated by the ability of N. gonorrhoeae to develop resistance to antimicrobials; accordingly, a combination therapy with azithromycin and a cephalosporin is used to improve treatment efficacy and potentially slow the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance.\nEffective measures for the primary prevention of gonorrhea infection include practicing abstinence, avoiding high-risk sexual behaviors (e.g. having unprotected sex or multiple sexual partners), and using latex condoms. Measure for the secondary prevention of gonorrhea infection include early detection, treatment of sexual partners, and treatment of other sexually transmitted infections (e.g. chlamydia).\n\n【2】 #Historical Perspective\nHowever, the exact time of onset of gonorrhea in history cannot be accurately determined from the extant historical record. In 1879, gonorrhea was referred to as “the clap” by German bacteriologist Albert Neisser.\n\n【3】 #Classification\nBased on anatomic location, gonorrhea may be classified into three subtypes: urogenital, extragenital, and disseminated gonococcal infection.\nAdditionally, gonococcal infections may be classified into many subtypes according to the affected organ system.\n\n【4】 #Pathophysiology\nGonorrhea is a sexually transmitted disease (STD) that is caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhea.\nIt can infect mucus-secreting epithelial cells in both men and women.\nEstablished routes of transmission of the Neisseria gonorrhoeae include vaginal intercourse, rectal intercourse, fellatio, cunnilingus, and perinatal.\nThe main pathogenicity of the Neisseria gonorrhea stems from the ability of the surface pili to attach to the surface of the urethra, fallopian tubes, and endocervix.\nAnother virulence factor of gonorrhea is porin. There are two main porin serotypes: PorB.A strains (resulting in a disseminated gonococcal infection) and PorB.B strains (resulting in local genital infections).\nIn pregnancy, gonococcus can be transmitted to the fetus at the time of delivery. This results in infection of the conjuctiva. This appears 1 to 4 days after birth as severe discharge with marked swelling and redness of the eyelids and conjunctiva.\nAdditionally, development of disseminated gonococcal infection is the result of Neisserial organisms' dissemination to the blood due to a variety of predisposing factors, such as change in PH, pregnancy, menstruation, PorB.A strains, and complement deficiencies.\n\n【5】 #Causes\nNeisseria gonorrhoeae, also known as gonococci (plural), gonococcus (singular), or gonorrhoea (in British English), is a species of Gram-negative, coffee bean-shaped diplococci bacteria that is responsible for the sexually transmitted infection gonorrhea.\nGonorrhea (gonorrhoea in British English) is among the most common sexually transmitted diseases in the world. The term comes from the Ancient Greek word γονόρροια (gonórrhoia), literally \"flow of seed\"; in ancient times, it was incorrectly believed that the pus discharge associated with the disease contained semen.\n\n【6】 #Differential diagnosis\nGonorrhea must be differentiated from other sexually transmitted pathogens, nongonococcal urethritis, vaginitis, cervicitis, urinary tract infections, prostatitis, and orchitis.\nAdditionally, disseminated gonococcal infection must be differentiated from herpes simplex virus (HSV), nongonococcal septic arthritis, syphilis, HIV infection,  rheumatic fever, reactive arthritis , and Lyme disease.\n\n【7】 #Epidemiology\nGonorrhea is a very common infectious disease.\nIn the United State, gonorrhea is the second most common STD (after chlamydia).\nIn 2012, the incidence of gonorrhea was reported as 106 million cases worldwide.\n\n【8】 #Risk factors\nCommon risk factors for the development of gonorrhea include sexual activity, having multiple sex partners, previous history of sexually transmitted diseases, having a partner with a past history of any sexually transmitted disease, and failure to use a condom during sex.\n\n【9】 #Screening\nThe U.S. Preventive Services and Task Force (USSTF) recommends screening for gonorrhea in sexually active women age 24 years and younger and in older women who are at increased risk for infection. Current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for gonorrhea in heterosexual men. However, USSTF recommends at least annual screening for gonorrhea among men who have sex with men (MSM).\n\n【10】 #Natural history, complications, and prognosis\nIn 50 to 70% of women, the initial infection with Neisseria gonorrhea may be asymptomatic.\nInitial infection is usually observed in the cervical region, but due to the presence of the surface pili, the infection may ascend through the uterus into the fallopian tubes and finally out into the peritoneal cavity.\nThe exact incubation period of gonorrhea is unknown. It may result in cervicitis and urethritis, which may present with dysuria, vaginal pruritus, and vaginal mucopurulent discharge.\nIf gonococcal infection is left untreated, it can progress to fibrosis. Fibrosis can result in fallopian tube stricture, tubo-ovarian cyst or abscess, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), Perihepatitis (Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome), and/or bartholinitis. The most common complication of untreated gonorrhea is pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which may lead to an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy. If left untreated, ectopic pregnancy can be life-threatening for the mother.\nIn men, gonorrhea usually results in urethritis, which may result in dysuria. If left untreated, gonorrhea may result in inflammation of the epididymis (epididymitis), prostate gland (prostatitis), and urethral structure (urethritis).\nDisseminated gonococcal infection (DGI) occurs in about 0.5 to 3% of patients, commonly following asymptomatic mucosal infection in both sexes.\nCommon complications of gonococcal infection in women may include salpingitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, Infertility, dyspareunia, and ectopic pregnancy.\nThe prognosis of urogenital and disseminated gonococcal infection are generally good with adequate treatment.\n\n【11】 ## History and Symptoms\nSpecific areas of focus when obtaining a history from the patient include number and type of sexual partners, contraception use, and previous history of sexually transmitted diseases. The majority of women with gonorrhea are asymptomatic, while some have vaginal discharge, lower abdominal pain, or pain during intercourse. Common symptoms of gonococcal infection among men include urethritis, which is associated with burning with urination and discharge from the penis. Either sex may also acquire gonorrhea of the throat from performing oral sex on an infected partner, usually a male partner. Such infection is asymptomatic in 90% of cases, and produces a sore throat in the remaining 10%. The incubation period is 2 to 14 days, with most of these symptoms occurring between 4 and 6 days after infection.\n\n【12】 ## Physical examination\nWomen with gonococcal infection usually appear to be well until the development of such complications as PID.  Physical examinations of women with gonococcal infection are usually remarkable for mucopurulent urethral, cervical, or vaginal discharge; friable appearance of the cervix; and cervical motion tenderness. Common physical examination finding of gonococcal infection in men include mucopurulent urethral discharge. Less commonly, penile edema and epididymal tenderness and edema (epididymitis) may also be seen as part of a complicated gonococcal infection.\nPhysical examination of patients with pharyngeal gonococcal infection is usually remarkable for mild pharyngeal exudates and rectal gonococcal infection is usually remarkable for mucopurulent anal discharge.\n\n【13】 The following images are associated with gonorrhea physical examination.\n- Penile discharge in a patient with gonorrhea - Source: /\n- Ophthalmia neonatorum - Source: /\n\n【14】 ## Laboratory tests\nEmpiric treatment for gonorrhea is usually initiated prior to the receipt of laboratory result. A microbiologic diagnosis is important for further management in order to determine the need for further testing, partner management, and public health considerations.\nAny sexually active man or women presenting with signs and symptoms of urethritis, cervicitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, and epididymitis should undergo diagnostic testing for Neisseria  gonorrhea. Additionally, the possibility of disseminated gonococcal infection (DGI) should be considered in all young sexually active individuals who present with arthralgias or suspected  septic arthritis.\nCommon laboratory tests for gonococcal infection may include gram stain, culture, nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT), and non-amplified tests. Nucleic acid amplification tests are the test of choice in all individuals who present with urogenital symptoms.\nAdditionally, synovial fluid analysis is usually sent for cell count, differential, gram stain, bacterial culture and NAAT in patients with suspected DGI.\n\n【15】 ## Other diagnostic studies\nOther diagnostic studies are used when NAAT or culture are not available. Other diagnostic studies for gonorrhea infection include rapid NAAT assay (modular-cartridge based platform), leukocyte esterase urine test, immunochromatographic tests, nucleic acid hybridization tests, and enzyme immunoassay (EIA).\n\n【16】 ## Medical therapy\nThe mainstay of therapy for gonococcal infections is antimicrobial therapy.  Gonorrhea treatment is complicated by the ability of N. gonorrhoeae to develop resistance to antimicrobials; accordingly, a combination therapy with azithromycin and a cephalosporin is used to improve treatment efficacy and potentially slow the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance.\n\n【17】 ## Antibiotic resistant\nGonorrhea treatment is complicated by the ability of Neisseria gonorrhoeae to develop resistance to antimicrobials. High-level resistance to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins and azithromycin is now reported, and it seems that developing another effective treatment has become unaffordable for pharmaceutical companies, though new combination antibiotic treatments are being evaluated. There are no affordable alternative therapeutic options currently available for the treatment of gonococcal disease, and it seems even newly developed antibiotics will be short-term solutions, as the bacterium may well develop resistance to them, too.\nIn 2006, CDC had five recommended treatment options for gonorrhea. Currently, the U.S. has only one remaining option.\n\n【18】 ## Primary prevention\nEffective measures for the primary prevention of gonococcal infection include accurate risk assessment and counseling, practicing abstinence, avoiding high-risk sexual behaviors (e.g. unprotected sex or multiple sexual partners), using latex condoms, and being in a long-term and monogamous relationship with an uninfected partner.\n\n【19】 ## Secondary prevention\nStrategies for the secondary prevention of gonococcal infection include early detection, treatment of sexual partners, and treatment of other sexually transmitted infections (e.g. chlamydia).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": "无关文本#13#13#Source: / Source: /", "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-05-08 01:37:59", "update_time": "2024-05-08 18:58:23"}

This will help to delay or prevent complications of diabetes. - Target ranges for blood glucose and A1C can vary and depend on a person's medical conditions and other risk factors. Work with your diabetes health-care team to determine your target A1C and blood glucose target range (fasting and after meals).\nOptimal glycemic control is fundamental to the management of diabetes. Regardless of the underlying treatment, glycated hemoglobin (A1C) levels >7.0% are associated with a significantly increased risk of both microvascular and cardiovascular (CV) complications . The initial data from the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT; type 1 diabetes)  and the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS; type 2 diabetes)  demonstrated a curvilinear relationship between A1C and diabetes complications, with no apparent threshold of benefit, although the absolute reduction in risk was substantially less at lower A1C levels. Similarly, both fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and postprandial plasma glucose (PPG) are directly correlated to the risk of complications, with some evidence that PPG might constitute a stronger independent risk factor for CV complications .\nEvidence indicates that improved glycemic control reduces the risk of both microvascular and CV complications. The initial prospective randomized controlled trials were conducted in people with recently diagnosed diabetes. These trials-the DCCT in type 1 diabetes , the Kumamoto trial  and the UKPDS .\nWhereas the UKPDS trial enrolled people with recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes, 3 major subsequent trials-the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD), Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron MR Controlled Evaluation (ADVANCE), and Veterans Affairs Diabetes Trial (VADT)-examined the effect of intensive glycemic control on people with long-standing type 2 diabetes. The ACCORD trial randomly assigned 10,251 participants who had either a previous history of cardiovascular disease (CVD) or multiple risk factors for CVD, and a baseline A1C level ≥7.5% to intensive therapy targeting an A1C <6.0% or standard therapy targeting an A1C level of 7.0% to 7.9% .\nThe ADVANCE trial randomly assigned 11,140 participants to standard (targeting A1C based on local guidelines) or intensive glucose control therapy aimed at reducing A1C ≤6.5% . Participants were ≥55 years of age with a history of major CV or microvascular disease or at least 1 other risk factor for CVD. The mean duration of diabetes was 8 years. After a 5-year follow up, mean A1C was 6.5% in the intensive group and 7.3% in the standard group. The primary outcome was a composite of microvascular events (nephropathy and retinopathy) and CV disease defined by major adverse CV events. There was significant reduction in the incidence of major microvascular events in the intensive control group, mainly through a 21% relative reduction in nephropathy ; however, no beneficial effect of intensive glucose lowering was found on major CV events or allcause mortality either during the trial or the subsequent median observational follow up of 5.4 years .\nData from a meta-analysis suggest that people with type 2 diabetes who receive intensive glucose lowering therapy have a reduced risk of the composite major adverse CV events (MACE) and MI, with no significant effect on the risk of total mortality, cardiac death, stroke and CHF . Although an explanation for the unexpected higher mortality rates associated with intensive-treatment in the ACCORD study remains elusive , the frequency of severe hypoglycemia in these trials was 2 to 3 times higher in the intensive therapy groups and a higher mortality was reported in participants with 1 or more episodes of severe hypoglycemia in the ACCORD , ADVANCE  and VADT trials , irrespective of the different treatment arms in which individual participants were allocated. Therefore, it has been suggested that a tight glycemic control with a target A1C of 6.0% may not be ideal for older/frail individuals, those with longer duration of diabetes, advanced coronary artery disease (CAD) and a known history of severe hypoglycemia  . Higher glycemic targets are also appropriate for functionally dependent adults of any age or individuals with limited life expectancy and little likelihood of benefit from intensive therapy.\nA1C measurement encompasses a component of both the FPG and postprandial PG.\nHowever, a major challenge in attempting to use evidencebased observations to determine the value of tighter PPG control has been the lack of well-designed, long-term outcome studies where assessing PPG values is the major objective of the study. Most of the large outcome trials conducted so far have been mostly based on preprandial glucose and A1C targets, with limited evidence of a long-term benefit of targeting PPG alone .\nAlthough, nontraditional glycemic targets, such as fructosamine and glycated albumin, have also been associated with CV outcomes and mortality in a cohort study , the broader utility of such targets and their correlation with A1C has not yet been established.\nFinally, glucose variability (GV) as an additional therapeutic goal has recently been gaining support. Limited data support the possibility that GV is involved in the pathogenesis of vascular complications of diabetes by inducing inflammatory activation and oxidative stress  and minimizing hypoglycemia duration, severity and frequency. However, management strategies that would minimize glucose variability and their impact on hard clinical outcomes remain to be determined before these novel measurement targets of glucose quality can systematically be incorporated into clinical practice guidelines.\nIntensive glucose control with lowering A1C values to ≤7.0% in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes provides strong benefits for microvascular complications and, if achieved early in the disease with avoidance of hypoglycemia and glucose variability as part of a multifactorial treatment approach, likely provide a significant CV benefit. More intensive glucose control, A1C ≤6.5%, may be sought in people with a shorter duration of diabetes and longer life expectancy, especially in those people who are on treatment with antihyperglycemic agents with a low risk of hypoglycemia. An A1C target ≤8.5% may be more appropriate in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes with limited life expectancy, higher level of functional dependency and a history of repeated severe hypoglycemia with hypoglycemia unawareness.

It is recommended only if:\npembrolizumab plus chemotherapy is not suitable the company provides nivolumab according to the commercial arrangement.\nThis recommendation is not intended to affect treatment with nivolumab that was started in the NHS before this guidance was published. People having treatment outside this recommendation may continue without change to the funding arrangements in place for them before this guidance was published, until they and their NHS clinician consider it appropriate to stop.\nWhy the committee made these recommendations\nStandard care for untreated unresectable advanced, recurrent, or metastatic oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma is fluoropyrimidine-based and platinum-based chemotherapy (chemotherapy). Some people may have pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy if their tumours express PD‑L1 with a combined positive score (CPS) of 10 or more.\nClinical trial evidence shows that for people whose tumours express PD‑L1 at a level of 1% or more, nivolumab plus chemotherapy increases how long they live compared with chemotherapy alone. It also increases the time before their cancer gets worse. Nivolumab plus chemotherapy has only been indirectly compared with pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy. Uncertainty in this comparison means it is difficult to determine which combination is more effective. The cost-effectiveness estimates for nivolumab compared with pembrolizumab are also uncertain, but nivolumab is unlikely to be cost effective compared with pembrolizumab.\nWhen compared with chemotherapy alone, nivolumab plus chemotherapy meets NICE's criteria to be a life-extending treatment at the end of life. Taking this into account, the cost-effectiveness estimates are likely within what NICE considers an acceptable use of NHS resources for this group. Therefore, nivolumab plus chemotherapy is recommended when pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy is unsuitable.\nTests for suitability of nivolumab (tumours express PD‑L1 at 1% or more) or pembrolizumab (tumours express PD‑L1 with CPS of 10 or more) should be done at the same time. This is to minimise any unnecessary delays in accessing treatment\n\n【3】 #Information about nivolumab\n\n【4】 #Marketing authorisation indication\n\n【5】 #Dosage in the marketing authorisation\nThe dosage schedule is available in the summary of product characteristics for nivolumab.\n\n【6】 The list price is £1,097 for a 100-mg vial (excluding VAT; BNF online accessed September 2022). The company has a commercial arrangement. This makes nivolumab available to the NHS with a discount. The size of the discount is commercial in confidenc\n\n【7】 #Committee discussion\n\n【8】 ## Oesophageal cancer is often diagnosed late and has a large impact on quality of life and a poor prognosis\nThe patient experts explained that there are no screening tools to identify oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma and often the condition is diagnosed at an advanced stage. They explained that people with the condition can struggle to maintain their fitness and manage their condition. The patient experts described that the condition and treatment side effects massively affect patients' quality of life, social experience and relationships with family and carers. They highlighted that advanced oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma is less survivable than other cancers.\n\n【9】 ## People would welcome a new treatment option for oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma\nNICE's technology appraisal guidance recommends pembrolizumab with platinum- and fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy for untreated advanced oesophageal and gastro-oesophageal junction cancer (TA737) in adults whose tumours express PD‑L1 with a combined positive score (CPS) of 10 or more. The clinical experts explained that pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy is widely used when it is suitable. However, patient experts were aware that some people do not have pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy despite its suitability. The clinical and patient experts agreed there is an unmet need in people for whom treatment with pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy is not suitable. The clinical experts explained that clinicians would value an additional treatment option because there may be circumstances in which nivolumab is preferred over pembrolizumab. The committee concluded that patients and clinicians would welcome a new treatment for untreated unresectable advanced, recurrent, or metastatic oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma.\n\n【10】 ## Testing for suitability of nivolumab or pembrolizumab should be done concurrently in NHS practice\nSuitability of nivolumab and pembrolizumab is assessed by measuring PD‑L1 status. The way that PD‑L1 positivity was measured and defined differed in the marketing authorisations for nivolumab and pembrolizumab. In the CheckMate-648 trial around half of participants in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population had tumour cell PD‑L1 expression with a level of 1% or more in line with nivolumab's marketing authorisation (measure of PD‑L1 expression on tumour cells as a ratio percentage). Pembrolizumab was also a suitable option for more than half of these participants because their tumours expressed PD‑L1 with a CPS of 10 or more, in line with its marketing authorisation (measure of PD‑L1 expression on tumour cells and immune cells as a ratio score). This means that both nivolumab and pembrolizumab were suitable for some people. In the pembrolizumab clinical trial (KEYNOTE-590), 51% of people had tumours that expressed PD‑L1 with a CPS of 10 or more. PD‑L1 status defined by tumour cell expression was not reported. The clinical experts highlighted that there is no clear clinical justification for attributing each specific test to either nivolumab or pembrolizumab. The committee acknowledged the overlap and differences between the 2 tests and the complexity it introduces. The company explained that, in clinical practice, treatment decisions for oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma might vary at different hospitals. It also explained they will not be based on tumour cell expression and CPS collectively because the 2 tests for assessing PD‑L1 are independent of each other. The committee was aware that testing is time and resource intensive. The clinical experts explained that it was preferrable that the 2 tests (tumour cell expression and CPS) would be done concurrently, rather than sequentially, to determine whether nivolumab or pembrolizumab is suitable and permissible. However, they highlighted that treatment decisions are often guided by local health service protocols which may use different approaches. The clinical experts did not agree on whether sequential testing would occur in practice. Clinical experts noted that testing tumour cell PD‑L1 expression may be more accessible to clinicians than testing PD‑L1 expression through CPS. This is because most hospitals can do the tumour cell test but few hospitals have facilities to do the CPS test. This means CPS test results can take 2 weeks or more when external testing is needed. Clinical experts suggested that because tumour cell testing is more accessible than CPS testing, clinicians are more likely to request it first when testing sequentially. The clinical and patient experts were concerned that the waiting time for CPS results and requirement for concurrent testing for nivolumab and pembrolizumab suitability could delay starting a suitable immunotherapy. They highlighted that a delay could disadvantage people, because it is better to start treatment as soon as possible so that the immune response associated with immunotherapies is generated as early as possible. There was uncertainty on whether both tests would be done sequentially or concurrently.\n\n【11】 ## Chemotherapy and pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy are relevant comparators, subject to the suitability of pembrolizumab\nThe company maintained that pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy was recommended too recently to be considered standard of care. It considered chemotherapy to be the main comparator for nivolumab plus chemotherapy. The clinical experts mentioned that in their centres they had observed slower uptake of pembrolizumab than anticipated. They attributed this to testing capacity issues associated with the COVID‑19 pandemic and differences in how diagnostic services do CPS tests. The Cancer Drugs Fund (CDF) lead stated that use of pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy had been increasing slowly, which is not unusual when there is a test needed for treatment. Despite differing opinions on the uptake of pembrolizumab, the clinical experts and CDF lead agreed that pembrolizumab should be considered as a comparator in this appraisal. The committee concluded that:\nchemotherapy alone is a relevant comparator when only nivolumab is suitable (tumour cell PD‑L1 expression at a level of 1% or more and a CPS of less than 10)\npembrolizumab plus chemotherapy is a relevant comparator when both nivolumab and pembrolizumab are suitable options (PD‑L1 positivity with tumour cell expression at a level of 1% or more and a CPS of 10 or more).\n\n【12】 ## CheckMate 648 data for the subgroup of people whose tumour cells express PD-L1 at 1% or more is appropriate for decision making\nCheckMate 648 is a randomised, three-arm, open-label, placebo-controlled trial (n=970). It compared cisplatin and fluorouracil, with or without nivolumab, and nivolumab plus ipilimumab, as first-line treatment for unresectable advanced, recurrent or metastatic oesophageal cancer. The nivolumab plus ipilimumab and chemotherapy trial arm was not included in the decision problem. The primary outcomes were progression-free survival and overall survival in the ITT population (n=645 for the nivolumab plus chemotherapy and chemotherapy trial arms). Progression-free survival and overall survival were reported for people with squamous cell oesophageal carcinoma whose tumour cells expressed PD‑L1 at 1% or more (n=315). The committee concluded that the data from this subgroup is appropriate for decision making when only nivolumab is suitable .\n\n【13】 ## Nivolumab improves progression-free survival and overall survival compared with chemotherapy alone\nData on progression-free survival and overall survival outcomes from the CheckMate 648 subgroup  are academic in confidence and cannot be presented here. The committee concluded that nivolumab plus chemotherapy improves both progression-free survival and overall survival compared with chemotherapy alone.\n\n【14】 ## There is uncertainty around the comparability of the trials included in the indirect treatment comparison\nNivolumab plus chemotherapy was indirectly compared with pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy in the absence of a direct trial comparison. Data for pembrolizumab came from the KEYNOTE‑590 trial. There was no efficacy data from the KEYNOTE‑590 population in whom nivolumab plus chemotherapy was suitable (tumour cell PD‑L1 expression of 1% or more). The indirect treatment comparison (ITC) used outcomes from the population for whom pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy was suitable (PD‑L1 expression with a CPS of 10 or more). Progression-free survival and overall survival outcome data from CheckMate 648 and KEYNOTE‑590 were indirectly compared. In KEYNOTE‑590, progression-free survival data was restricted to oesophageal cancer with squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma histologies, and overall survival data was restricted to squamous cell histology. A comparability assessment between the 2 trials showed that CheckMate 648 included more people with an Asian family background and fewer people had metastatic disease. The company compared some baseline characteristics from people in both trials whose tumours had PD‑L1 expression with a CPS of 10 or more. The ERG agreed that this subgroup appeared comparable to the ITT populations in the trials. However, it was noted that conclusions around trial comparability are limited because the only characteristics presented were age, Asian family background, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group status and metastatic disease. Also, these characteristics were only available as an average of both trial arms in KEYNOTE‑590 (pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy and chemotherapy alone). One clinical expert highlighted that people in the 2 trials are likely to be comparable, based on the overall survival that was observed in the control arms of both trials. They also said there is little clinical understanding of how outcomes may differ by how PD‑L1 expression was measured (tumour cell expression or CPS). Furthermore, they stated there is also uncertainty in how outcomes may differ in the broader oesophageal cancer population and in tumours which express PD‑L1. Another clinical expert commented that while CheckMate 648 included only people with oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma, KEYNOTE‑590 included people with squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma, located in either the oesophagus or the gastroesophageal junction. This made it difficult to reach any conclusions about trial comparability. The committee noted there was uncertainty about the comparability of the 2 trials used in the ITC.\n\n【15】 ## The indirect comparison does not give clear evidence of superiority of one treatment over the other\nThe company explored various ITC analyses to estimate the relative treatment effect of nivolumab plus chemotherapy versus pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy in terms of progression-free survival and overall survival. The company's analyses included people from CheckMate 648 for whom both nivolumab and pembrolizumab were suitable . This generated time-varying progression-free survival hazard ratios (HRs) which favoured pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy from 3 months. The overall survival HRs favoured nivolumab plus chemotherapy after 6 months. The ERG's base-case analyses included people from CheckMate 648 for whom pembrolizumab was suitable . These generated time-varying progression-free survival and overall survival HRs which favoured pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy over all time points. The ERG favoured including people for whom pembrolizumab was suitable, to maintain maximum trial comparability because the information on suitability of nivolumab in KEYNOTE‑590 was not available . The company and ERG base-case analyses also differed in the distributions used to extrapolate survival and which treatments were used as the baseline to scale pembrolizumab survival estimates. In both analyses, the HR credible intervals were wide and crossed 1. The ERG commented that the methodologies used in the ITC were robust and there were some arguments for using the company's base-case analysis. However, the ERG concluded that it was difficult to determine whether 1 treatment extended progression-free survival or overall survival more than the other.The clinical experts maintained that the effectiveness of nivolumab and pembrolizumab (in terms of response or survival) is almost the same in other cancers, highlighting an immunotherapy 'class effect'. They expect this effect to be consistent in treating oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma tumours. They further explained that comparing nivolumab and pembrolizumab across different definitions of PD‑L1 positivity and trial datasets was 'risky' in terms of validity. The CDF lead explained that pembrolizumab is administered less frequently than nivolumab, which may provide added benefit to people and also reduce the burden on NHS cancer services because fewer hospital visits would be needed.The committee acknowledged the complexity of calculating a reliable relative treatment effect in the comparison of nivolumab and pembrolizumab. The clinical experts, company, ERG and committee all agreed that no definitive evidence of superiority of one treatment over the other had been presented.\n\n【16】 ## The company's economic model is appropriate for decision making\nThe company presented a 3‑state partitioned survival model to estimate the cost effectiveness of nivolumab plus chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy and pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy. The 3 health states were progression-free survival, progressive disease, and death. The ERG agreed that the company's model structure captured all relevant health states and that partitioned survival models are widely used in cancer modelling. The ERG's concerns on the model structure related to the modelling of effectiveness associated with subsequent therapy. The company included a 2‑year stopping rule for nivolumab. Although this is not included in the marketing authorisation, it reflects the use in the trial and expected use in clinical practice, in line with nivolumab use in other cancers. The committee concluded that the company's model structure was acceptable for decision making.\n\n【17】 ## It is unclear which model for estimating overall survival is more appropriate\nThe company used Kaplan–Meier data from CheckMate 648 to model overall survival in both treatment arms, with a log-normal extrapolation from 6.9 months. The company justified the semi-parametric approach stating it better reflects the changing hazard observed after 20 months in both trial arms and noted a clear inflection point for the chemotherapy arm smoothed hazard plot at around 6 months. The ERG did not agree with the company's approach and used a parametric log-logistic extrapolation in their base case. It justified the parametric extrapolation by noting no clear inflection point for the nivolumab plus chemotherapy smoothed hazard plot. It also found a reasonable correspondence of the landmark overall survival observed in CheckMate 648 with the parametric overall survival analysis. The committee heard that a semi-parametric extrapolation of overall survival was broadly accepted by the committee in TA737. The committee acknowledged there was uncertainty in the long-term overall survival and there were arguments for each approach.\n\n【18】 ## In-trial switching may have had an impact on overall survival, but its effect is uncertain\nThere was evidence of treatment switching in CheckMate 648, with a proportion of both arms who had subsequent systemic and anti-PD‑L1 therapies (including nivolumab and pembrolizumab). The company considered that a decreasing hazard rate (mortality rate) observed in the chemotherapy arm of CheckMate 648 was implausible. The ERG argued that it might be partly because of in-trial switching to an anti-PD‑L1 therapy. The ERG also noted that, although only a fraction of people in the trial switched to an anti-PD‑L1 therapy, the company assumed in its economic model that all people who had subsequent treatment in clinical practice would have an anti-PD‑L1 therapy. The ERG suggested that this might lead to a bias where the effectiveness of chemotherapy had been underestimated in the economic model. To overcome the bias in results, it preferred an adjustment of overall survival in the model using methods outlined in NICE's Decision Support Unit technical support document 16. The company elected against including a switching adjustment in their base-case modelling of overall survival, commenting that few people switched to an anti-PD‑L1 therapy in the trial. It also explained that the switching adjustment methods in the technical support document place large demands on limited data which can create more uncertainty. The company presented 2 switching adjustment scenario analyses: a rank-preserving structural failure time model and a model-based approach. As the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of nivolumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy increased markedly in these scenarios, the ERG maintained that the ICER is underestimated without a switching adjustment. The committee heard that switching was not included in TA737. While the ERG acknowledged this, it again referred to the clinical evidence that it said demonstrated switching and the difference between the proportion switching in the trial and that which would occur in clinical practice. A clinical expert explained that switching to an anti-PD‑L1 therapy may introduce some bias, but it was not expected to be impactful on overall survival. The committee concluded that the switching may have an impact on the overall survival in both trial arms, but that its overall impact was uncertain.\n\n【19】 ## It is reasonable to expect some treatment waning after treatment is stopped, but the impact on overall survival is uncertain\nIn its base case, the company assumed there was no waning of treatment effect after stopping nivolumab. It commented that there was evidence of a robust and durable treatment effect lasting beyond discontinuation for immunotherapies. It stated that if any treatment waning was to occur it would be 5 years after starting therapy. It referenced NICE's technology appraisal of nivolumab for untreated HER2-negative advanced gastric, gastro-oesophageal junction or oesophageal adenocarcinoma in which the committee considered a 5‑year assumption of treatment waning to be plausible. The ERG disagreed with this assumption and included the waning of treatment effect on overall survival for nivolumab from 2.5 years to 4.0 years after starting therapy and 6 months after stopping therapy. The ERG justified the assumptions, explaining that for some overall survival parametric functions the nivolumab plus chemotherapy treatment effect versus chemotherapy alone increased over time, which was considered implausible. Additionally, the ERG highlighted that treatment waning assumptions were not disregarded by the committee in TA737. However, it noted that no conclusions about the appropriateness of waning were made by the committee. The company commented that there was no clear justification for the 2.5 years to 4.0 years treatment waning assumptions preferred by the ERG.The clinical experts commented that some treatment waning is possible and it is more likely when nivolumab plus chemotherapy is discontinued early. The committee considered that based on the maturity of the data in CheckMate 648, the treatment effect may be captured within the observed results making an adjustment of the extrapolation of overall survival for treatment waning unnecessary.The committee acknowledged that the treatment waning effect of pembrolizumab was discussed in TA737 and that no conclusions on the appropriateness of waning were stated in the final guidance. It concluded that assuming a lifelong treatment effect of nivolumab may be over optimistic and some treatment waning might be expected. However, there was not enough evidence to be precise about when this would occur. The committee concluded that it would consider scenarios with and without treatment waning in its decision making, only if they impact the final decision on cost effectiveness.\n\n【20】 ## Modelling risk of death is uncertain, but has minimal impact on the cost-effectiveness estimates\nThe reduction in the risk of death in CheckMate 648 was similar to that of background mortality. The company and the ERG agreed that mortality should not be any lower than background (all-cause) mortality. To enforce a plausible minimum rate of mortality, a background mortality rate was included in the model, additional to the predicted overall survival. The company maintained that the approach resulted in very little difference in the overall survival. However, the ERG considered this approach to double-count mortality in the model and preferred the use of alternative methods which prevent implausibly low mortality hazard with any overall survival extrapolation. The committee acknowledged the justifications for each modelling approach but did not conclude which was preferable because each assumption had a minimal impact on the cost-effectiveness estimates.\n\n【21】 ## Treatment-specific health-related quality of life estimates are not considered appropriate\nUtility values in the model were calculated using EQ‑5D data from CheckMate 648. The company attributed utilities to the progression-based health states in its base case, using the average utility reported in the 2 trial arms. The ERG explained that because the EQ‑5D scores reported were consistently higher for chemotherapy compared with nivolumab plus chemotherapy, treatment-specific utilities were more appropriate. The clinical experts suggested toxicity associated with nivolumab therapy may explain lower utility values compared with chemotherapy alone. The clinical experts stated that they would expect the opposite in practice, with people who had nivolumab plus chemotherapy likely to have higher utility because of better disease control. The CDF lead and clinical experts did not agree with using the treatment-specific utilities. This is based on their experience that health-related quality of life disutilities associated with anti-PD‑(L)‑1 immunotherapies toxicity would be outweighed by the health benefit derived from response to therapy. Because treatment-specific utilities are clinically plausible, the committee concluded that treatment-specific utilities were not appropriate.\n\n【22】 ## There is uncertainty in the calculation of treatment costs weighted by delayed or missed doses\nA proportion of people in CheckMate 648 delayed or missed doses of their trial treatment. In its base-case analysis, the company adjusted treatment costs based on the mean relative dose intensity observed in the trial. These treatment costs were then weighted by the time each patient spent on treatment. The ERG explained that time on therapy was not relevant for capturing the relative dose intensity and omitted this from its base case. The company stated that the treatment discontinuation biased the treatment cost calculations. The committee noted uncertainty in both approaches taken.\n\n【23】 ## Nivolumab plus chemotherapy meets end of life criteria compared with chemotherapy, but not with pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy\nThe committee considered the advice about life-extending treatments for people with a short life expectancy in NICE's guide to the methods of technology appraisal. It considered whether nivolumab plus chemotherapy met the end of life criteria compared with chemotherapy for people in whom pembrolizumab is unsuitable. The company and ERG both agreed that data suggests that life expectancy in this population is less than 24 months. The observed median overall survival benefit with nivolumab plus chemotherapy in CheckMate 648 was larger than the additional 3‑month extension to life needed by the criteria (data are academic in confidence and cannot be presented here). The committee considered whether nivolumab plus chemotherapy met the end of life criteria compared with pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy for people in whom pembrolizumab is suitable. The company and ERG both agreed, based on the KEYNOTE‑590 analyses, that life expectancy in this population is less than 24 months. Based on the ITC analyses , the median overall survival benefit of nivolumab plus chemotherapy compared with pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy did not exceed the additional 3‑month extension to life needed by the criteria (the data cannot be reported here because the company submitted it as academic in confidence). The committee concluded that nivolumab met the end of life criteria compared with chemotherapy but that criteria were not met compared with pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy.\n\n【24】 ## Nivolumab is unlikely to be cost effective when compared with pembrolizumab\nThe company's base-case comparison of nivolumab with pembrolizumab included the following assumptions:\nsemi-parametric extrapolation of progression-free and overall survival data from CheckMate 648 for nivolumab\nexcluding any adjustments to overall survival for subsequent therapy\nincluding all-cause mortality, additional to the predicted overall survival mortality\nusing progression-based utilities, independent of the treatment received\nadjusting treatment costs by the relative dose intensity, weighted by the time on treatment .Differences in the company's and ERG's base case are in the methodology used for the ITC. The company base case used the following ITC analyses assumptions :\nincluding outcome data from people in CheckMate 648 for whom both nivolumab and pembrolizumab was suitable and people from KEYNOTE‑590 for whom pembrolizumab was suitable\nscaling nivolumab and pembrolizumab survival using chemotherapy as the baseline using log-normal distribution to extrapolate overall survival.The ERG's base-case analyses differed from the company's because it included people from CheckMate 648 for whom only pembrolizumab was suitable. The company and ERG base-case analyses also differed in the distribution used to extrapolate survival and which treatment was used as the baseline to scale pembrolizumab survival estimates.The ICERs cannot be reported here because of confidential commercial arrangements for nivolumab and pembrolizumab. The company's and ERG's base-case cost-effectiveness estimates were similar, both showing nivolumab plus chemotherapy to be dominated by pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy. The committee concluded that it was unlikely that nivolumab plus chemotherapy would be a cost-effective use of NHS resources when pembrolizumab is a suitable option.\n\n【25】 ## Nivolumab plus chemotherapy is cost effective when compared with chemotherapy alone when pembrolizumab is unsuitable\nThe company's comparison of nivolumab plus chemotherapy with chemotherapy for people in whom pembrolizumab is not suitable used the same assumptions as for the comparison with pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy . The ERG's base case included the same assumptions as the company in its exclusion of an adjustment on survival for switching . The ERG's assumptions differed from the company in the approach to modelling progression-free survival and overall survival, and parametric extrapolation was modelled with a waning of nivolumab treatment effect between 2.5 years and 4 years . Additionally, treatment-specific progression utilities were included in the model , and the relative dose intensity was not weighted by time on treatment . The ICERs cannot be reported here because of confidential commercial arrangements for nivolumab and subsequent treatments. Including the ERG's assumptions increased the ICER compared with the company's base case, however the company's cost-effectiveness estimates are below the end of life threshold of £50,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. While the ERG's cost-effectiveness estimates are above £50,000 per QALY gained, the committee did not agree with the assumption of treatment-specific utilities. Removing this assumption provided cost-effectiveness estimates which were below £50,000 per QALY gained. Because end of life criteria have been met , the committee concluded that nivolumab plus chemotherapy is likely a cost-effective use of NHS resources when pembrolizumab is unsuitable.\n\n【26】 ## There are no equality issues relevant to the recommendations\nPatient experts explained that people living in the most deprived areas are more likely to be diagnosed with oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma later than others. The committee noted that the issues surrounding the delays in diagnosis are unable to be addressed in technology appraisal guidance.\n\n【27】 #Innovation\nThe company and patient experts stated that nivolumab plus chemotherapy has a number of benefits including improved efficacy outcomes compared with chemotherapy, maintenance of quality of life, an acceptable safety profile and providing an additional treatment option for people with high unmet need. They also stated that PD‑L1 test results for suitability of nivolumab are available quicker than PD‑L1 test results for suitability of pembrolizumab. This is because the CPS test is more complex than the tumour cell test and often needs to be requested from an external diagnostic centre. The committee concluded that it had not been presented with any evidence for benefits not captured in the model.\n\n【28】 ## Nivolumab is recommended for routine use only when pembrolizumab is unsuitable\nThe committee noted that the company's and ERG's base-case conclusions aligned in that nivolumab plus chemotherapy was dominated by pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy, that is higher cost and lower efficacy. The committee acknowledged the uncertainty around relative treatment effects for the 2 treatments, but concluded that nivolumab plus chemotherapy was unlikely to be cost effective compared with pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy.The committee noted that the company's base case suggested that nivolumab plus chemotherapy is likely to be cost effective compared with chemotherapy, for people for whom pembrolizumab is not suitable. This is when considering nivolumab as a life-extending treatment for people with short life expectancy . The committee also noted that the ERG's base case suggested that it was unlikely to be cost effective compared with chemotherapy alone, even in the context of a life-extending treatment for people with a short life expectancy . However, nivolumab was cost effective when treatment-specific utilities, which the committee deemed as inappropriate, were removed from the ERG's analyses and when considering end of life criteria .Despite the remaining areas of uncertainty, it was agreed that the cost-effectiveness estimates for nivolumab when pembrolizumab is not suitable are likely to be within the range usually considered a cost-effective use of NHS resources. This is for a life-extending treatment for people with short life expectancy. Therefore, nivolumab with platinum- and fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy is recommended for use in the NHS as an option for untreated unresectable advanced, recurrent, or metastatic oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma, in adults whose tumour cells express PD‑L1 at 1% or more. It is recommended only if pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy is unsuitable. The committee recalled the current implementation issues for testing . It therefore also concluded that testing for suitability of nivolumab and pembrolizumab should be done at the same time.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-05-08 01:37:59", "update_time": "2024-05-08 19:12:46"}

In infants and small children the periphery of the upper outer quadrant of the gluteal region should be used only when necessary, such as in burn patients, in order to minimize the possibility of damage to the sciatic nerve.\nThe deltoid area should be used only if well developed such as in certain adults and older children, and then only with caution to avoid radial nerve injury. Intramuscular injections should not be made into the lower and mid-third of the upper arm. As with all intramuscular injections, aspiration is necessary to help avoid inadvertent injection into a blood vessel.\nInjection sites should be alternated. As higher doses or more prolonged therapy with streptomycin may be indicated for more severe or fulminating infections (endocarditis, meningitis, etc.), the physician should always take adequate measures to be immediately aware of any toxic signs or symptoms occurring in the patient as a result of streptomycin therapy.\n1. Tuberculosis: The standard regimen for the treatment of drug susceptible tuberculosis has been two months of INH, rifampin and pyrazinamide followed by four months of INH and rifampin (patients with concomitant infection with tuberculosis and HIV may require treatment for a longer period). When streptomycin is added to this regimen because of suspected or proven drug resistance , the recommended dosing for streptomycin is as follows:\nStreptomycin is usually administered daily as a single intramuscular injection. A total dose of not more than 120 g over the course of therapy should be given unless there are no other therapeutic options. In patients older than 60 years of age the drug should be used at a reduced dosage due to the risk of increased toxicity.\n2. Tularemia: One to 2 g daily in divided doses for 7 to 14 days until the patient is afebrile for 5 to 7 days.\n3.

It is considered the physician's gold standard, as it reflects the probability that a positive test reflects the underlying condition of interest.\n\n【2】 #Definition\nThe Positive Predictive Value can be defined as\nPPV = \\frac{\\rm number\\ of\\ True\\ Positives}{{\\rm number\\ of\\ True\\ Positives}+{\\rm number\\ of\\ False\\ Positives}}\n-r, alternatively,\nPPV = \\frac{({\\rm sensitivity}) ({\\rm prevalence})}{({\\rm sensitivity}) ({\\rm prevalence}) + (1 - {\\rm specificity}) (1-{\\rm prevalence})}\n\n【3】 #Problems with Positive Predictive Value\n- Predictive values are often used in medical research to evaluate the usefulness of a diagnostic test. Hence the PPV is used to indicate the probability that in case of a positive test, that the patient really has the specified disease. However there may be more than one cause for a disease and any single potential cause may not always result in the overt disease seen in a patient.\n- An example is the microbiological throat swab used in patients with a sore throat. Usually publications stating PPV of a throat swab are reporting on the probability that this bacteria is present in the throat, rather than that the patient is ill from the bacteria found. If presence of this bacteria always resulted in a sore throat, then the PPV would be very useful. However the bacteria may colonise individuals in a harmless way and never result in infection or disease. Sore throats occurring in these individuals is caused by other agents such as a virus. In this situation the gold standard used in the evaluation study represents only the presence of a bacteria (that might be harmless) but not a causal bacterial sore throat illness. It can be proven that this problem will affect positive predictive value far more than negative predictive value. To evaluate diagnostic tests where the gold standard looks only at potential causes of disease, one may use an extension of the  predictive value termed the Etiologic Predictive Value.\n- PPV is a function of the population sampled whereby a higher yield occurs in a higher risk group.\n- PPV is influenced by sensitivity, specificity, prevalence, and diagnostic pre-clinical phase of disease.\n\n【4】 - Negative predictive value\n- Relevance (information retrieval)\n- Receiver-operator characteristic", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": "", "type4": "语义不完整#0#0#S.没表述完", "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-05-08 01:37:59", "update_time": "2024-05-08 21:58:12"}

When a patient becomes unconscious, the muscles in the jaw commonly relax and can allow the tongue to slide back and obstruct the airway.  The purpose of the flared end is to prevent the device from becoming lost inside the patient's head. A safety pin is often included in the NPA kit to be attached to the outside for just such a purpose.\n\n【1】 #Indications and contraindications\nNasopharygeal airways are sometimes used by people who have sleep apnea.\nThese devices are also used by emergency care professionals such as EMT'S and paramedics in situations where an artificial form of airway maintenance is necessary but it is impossible or unadvisory to use an oropharyngeal airway, the preferred type of airway adjunct. For example, in a patient having epileptic seizures whose teeth are clenched shut. In an unconscious patient, suction of the upper airways may also be applied via an NPA.\nInsertion of an NPA is contraindicated in patients with severe head or facial injuries, or have evidence of a basal skull fracture (Battle's sign) due to the possibility of direct intrusion upon brain tissue.  An oropharyngeal airway may be used instead, but these devices frequently trigger a patient's gag reflex, while nasopharyngeal airways often do not.\n\n【2】 #Insertion\nThe correct size airway is chosen by measuring the device on the patient: the device should reach from the patient's nostril to the earlobe or the angle of the jaw.  The outside of the tube is lubricated with a water-based lubricant so that it enters the nose more easily.

Once bound to the cell membrane, interferons initiate a complex sequence of intracellular events. In vitro studies demonstrated that these include the induction of certain enzymes, suppression of cell proliferation, immunomodulating activities such as enhancement of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of lymphocytes for target cells, and inhibition of virus replication in virus-infected cells.\nIn a study using human hepatoblastoma cell line HB 611, the in vitro antiviral activity of alpha interferon was demonstrated by its inhibition of hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication.\nThe correlation between these in vitro data and the clinical results is unknown. Any of these activities might contribute to interferon's therapeutic effects.\n\n【3】 ### Pharmacokinetics\nThe pharmacokinetics of INTRON A were studied in 12 healthy male volunteers following single doses of 5 million IU/m2 administered intramuscularly, subcutaneously, and as a 30-minute intravenous infusion in a crossover design.\nThe mean serum INTRON A concentrations following intramuscular and subcutaneous injections were comparable. The maximum serum concentrations obtained via these routes were approximately 18 to 116 IU/mL and occurred 3 to 12 hours after administration. The elimination half-life of INTRON A following both intramuscular and subcutaneous injections was approximately 2 to 3 hours. Serum concentrations were undetectable by 16 hours after the injections.\nAfter intravenous administration, serum INTRON A concentrations peaked (135–273 IU/mL) by the end of the 30-minute infusion, then declined at a slightly more rapid rate than after intramuscular or subcutaneous drug administration, becoming undetectable 4 hours after the infusion. The elimination half-life was approximately 2 hours.\nUrine INTRON A concentrations following a single dose (5 million IU/m2) were not detectable after any of the parenteral routes of administration. This result was expected since preliminary studies with isolated and perfused rabbit kidneys have shown that the kidney may be the main site of interferon catabolism.\nThere are no pharmacokinetic data available for the intralesional route of administration.\n\n【4】 ### Serum Neutralizing Antibodies\nIn INTRON A-treated patients tested for antibody activity in clinical trials, serum anti-interferon neutralizing antibodies were detected in 0% (0/90) of patients with hairy cell leukemia, 0.8% (2/260) of patients treated intralesionally for condylomata acuminata, and 4% (1/24) of patients with AIDS-Related Kaposi's Sarcoma. Serum neutralizing antibodies have been detected in less than 3% of patients treated with higher INTRON A doses in malignancies other than hairy cell leukemia or AIDS-Related Kaposi's Sarcoma. The clinical significance of the appearance of serum anti-interferon neutralizing activity in these indications is not known.\nSerum anti-interferon neutralizing antibodies were detected in 7% (12/168) of patients either during treatment or after completing 12 to 48 weeks of treatment with 3 million IU TIW of INTRON A therapy for chronic hepatitis C and in 13% (6/48) of patients who received INTRON A therapy for chronic hepatitis B at 5 million IU QD for 4 months, and in 3% (1/33) of patients treated at 10 million IU TIW. Serum anti-interferon neutralizing antibodies were detected in 9% (5/53) of pediatric patients who received INTRON A therapy for chronic hepatitis B at 6 million IU/m2 TIW. Among all chronic hepatitis B or C patients, pediatrics and adults with detectable serum neutralizing antibodies, the titers detected were low (22/24 with titers less than or equal to 1:40 and 2/24 with titers less than or equal to 1:160). The appearance of serum anti-interferon neutralizing activity did not appear to affect safety or efficacy.\n\n【5】 ## Hairy Cell Leukemia\nIn clinical trials in patients with hairy cell leukemia, there was depression of hematopoiesis during the first 1 to 2 months of INTRON A treatment, resulting in reduced numbers of circulating red and white blood cells, and platelets. Subsequently, both splenectomized and nonsplenectomized patients achieved substantial and sustained improvements in granulocytes, platelets, and hemoglobin levels in 75% of treated patients and at least some improvement (minor responses) occurred in 90%. INTRON A treatment resulted in a decrease in bone marrow hypercellularity and hairy cell infiltrates. The hairy cell index (HCI), which represents the percent of bone marrow cellularity times the percent of hairy cell infiltrate, was greater than or equal to 50% at the beginning of the study in 87% of patients. The percentage of patients with such an HCI decreased to 25% after 6 months and to 14% after 1 year. These results indicate that even though hematologic improvement had occurred earlier, prolonged INTRON A treatment may be required to obtain maximal reduction in tumor cell infiltrates in the bone marrow.\nThe percentage of patients with hairy cell leukemia who required red blood cell or platelet transfusions decreased significantly during treatment and the percentage of patients with confirmed and serious infections declined as granulocyte counts improved. Reversal of splenomegaly and of clinically significant hypersplenism was demonstrated in some patients.\nA study was conducted to assess the effects of extended INTRON A treatment on duration of response for patients who responded to initial therapy. In this study, 126 responding patients were randomized to receive additional INTRON A treatment for 6 months or observation for a comparable period, after 12 months of initial INTRON A therapy. During this 6-month period, 3% (2/66) of INTRON A-treated patients relapsed compared with 18% (11/60) who were not treated. This represents a significant difference in time to relapse in favor of continued INTRON A treatment (P=0.006/0.01, Log Rank/Wilcoxon). Since a small proportion of the total population had relapsed, median time to relapse could not be estimated in either group. A similar pattern in relapses was seen when all randomized treatment, including that beyond 6 months, and available follow-up data were assessed. The 15% (10/66) relapses among INTRON A patients occurred over a significantly longer period of time than the 40% (24/60) with observation (P=0.0002/0.0001, Log Rank/Wilcoxon). Median time to relapse was estimated, using the Kaplan-Meier method, to be 6.8 months in the observation group but could not be estimated in the INTRON A group.\nSubsequent follow-up with a median time of approximately 40 months demonstrated an overall survival of 87.8%. In a comparable historical control group followed for 24 months, overall median survival was approximately 40%.\n\n【6】 ## Malignant Melanoma\nThe safety and efficacy of INTRON A was evaluated as adjuvant to surgical treatment in patients with melanoma who were free of disease (post surgery) but at high risk for systemic recurrence. These included patients with lesions of Breslow thickness greater than 4 mm, or patients with lesions of any Breslow thickness with primary or recurrent nodal involvement. In a randomized, controlled trial in 280 patients, 143 patients received INTRON A therapy at 20 million IU/m2 intravenously five times per week for 4 weeks (induction phase) followed by 10 million IU/m2 subcutaneously three times per week for 48 weeks (maintenance phase). In the clinical trial, the median daily INTRON A dose administered to patients was 19.1 million IU/m2 during the induction phase and 9.1 million IU/m2 during the maintenance phase. INTRON A therapy was begun less than or equal to 56 days after surgical resection. The remaining 137 patients were observed.\nINTRON A therapy produced a significant increase in relapse-free and overall survival. Median time to relapse for the INTRON A-treated patients versus observation patients was 1.72 years versus 0.98 years (P<0.01, stratified Log Rank). The estimated 5-year relapse-free survival rate, using the Kaplan-Meier method, was 37% for INTRON A-treated patients versus 26% for observation patients. Median overall survival time for INTRON A-treated patients versus observation patients was 3.82 years versus 2.78 years (P=0.047, stratified Log Rank). The estimated 5-year overall survival rate, using the Kaplan-Meier method, was 46% for INTRON A-treated patients versus 37% for observation patients.\nIn a second study of 642 resected high-risk melanoma patients, subjects were randomized equally to one of three groups: high-dose INTRON A therapy for 1 year (same schedule as above), low-dose INTRON A therapy for 2 years (3 MU/d TIW SC), and observation. Consistent with the earlier trial, high-dose INTRON A therapy demonstrated an improvement in relapse-free survival (3-year estimated RFS 48% versus 41%; median RFS 2.4 versus 1.6 years,P=not significant). Relapse-free survival in the low-dose INTRON A arm was similar to that seen in the observation arm. Neither high-dose nor low-dose INTRON A therapy showed a benefit in overall survival as compared to observation in this study.\n\n【7】 ## Follicular Lymphoma\nThe safety and efficacy of INTRON A in conjunction with CHVP, a combination chemotherapy regimen, was evaluated as initial treatment in patients with clinically aggressive, large tumor burden, Stage III/IV follicular Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma. Large tumor burden was defined by the presence of any one of the following: a nodal or extranodal tumor mass with a diameter of greater than 7 cm; involvement of at least three nodal sites (each with a diameter of greater than 3 cm); systemic symptoms; splenomegaly; serous effusion, orbital or epidural involvement; ureteral compression; or leukemia.\nIn a randomized, controlled trial, 130 patients received CHVP therapy and 135 patients received CHVP therapy plus INTRON A therapy at 5 million IU subcutaneously three times weekly for the duration of 18 months. CHVP chemotherapy consisted of cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2, doxorubicin 25 mg/m2, and teniposide (VM-26) 60 mg/m2, administered intravenously on Day 1 and prednisone at a daily dose of 40 mg/m2 given orally on Days 1 to 5. Treatment consisted of six CHVP cycles administered monthly, followed by an additional six cycles administered every 2 months for 1 year. Patients in both treatment groups received a total of 12 CHVP cycles over 18 months.\n\n【8】 ## Condylomata Acuminata\nCondylomata acuminata (venereal or genital warts) are associated with infections of the human papilloma virus (HPV). The safety and efficacy of INTRON A in the treatment of condylomata acuminata were evaluated in three controlled double-blind clinical trials. In these studies, INTRON A doses of 1 million IU per lesion were administered intralesionally three times a week (TIW), in less than or equal to 5 lesions per patient for 3 weeks. The patients were observed for up to 16 weeks after completion of the full treatment course.\nINTRON A treatment of condylomata was significantly more effective than placebo, as measured by disappearance of lesions, decreases in lesion size, and by an overall change in disease status. Of 192 INTRON A-treated patients and 206 placebo-treated patients who were evaluable for efficacy at the time of best response during the course of the study, 42% of INTRON A patients versus 17% of placebo patients experienced clearing of all treated lesions. Likewise, 24% of INTRON A patients versus 8% of placebo patients experienced marked (75% to less than 100%) reduction in lesion size, 18% versus 9% experienced moderate (50% to 75%) reduction in lesion size, 10% versus 42% had a slight (less than 50%) reduction in lesion size, 5% versus 24% had no change in lesion size, and 0% versus 1% experienced exacerbation (P<0.001).\nIn one of these studies, 43% (54/125) of patients in whom multiple (less than or equal to 3) lesions were treated experienced complete clearing of all treated lesions during the course of the study. Of these patients, 81% remained cleared 16 weeks after treatment was initiated.\nPatients who did not achieve total clearing of all their treated lesions had these same lesions treated with a second course of therapy. During this second course of treatment, 38% to 67% of patients had clearing of all treated lesions. The overall percentage of patients who had cleared all their treated lesions after two courses of treatment ranged from 57% to 85%.\nINTRON A-treated lesions showed improvement within 2 to 4 weeks after the start of treatment in the above study; maximal response to INTRON A therapy was noted 4 to 8 weeks after initiation of treatment.\nThe response to INTRON A therapy was better in patients who had condylomata for shorter durations than in patients with lesions for a longer duration.\nAnother study involved 97 patients in whom three lesions were treated with either an intralesional injection of 1.5 million IU of INTRON A per lesion followed by a topical application of 25% podophyllin, or a topical application of 25% podophyllin alone. Treatment was given once a week for 3 weeks. The combined treatment of INTRON A and podophyllin was shown to be significantly more effective than podophyllin alone, as determined by the number of patients whose lesions cleared. This significant difference in response was evident after the second treatment (Week 3) and continued through 8 weeks post-treatment. At the time of the patient's best response, 67% (33/49) of the INTRON A- and podophyllin-treated patients had all three treated lesions clear while 42% (20/48) of the podophyllin-treated patients had all three clear (P=0.003).\n\n【9】 ## AIDS-Related Kaposi's Sarcoma\nThe safety and efficacy of INTRON A in the treatment of Kaposi's Sarcoma (KS), a common manifestation of the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), were evaluated in clinical trials in 144 patients.\nIn one study, INTRON A doses of 30 million IU/m2 were administered subcutaneously three times per week (TIW) to patients with AIDS-Related KS. Doses were adjusted for patient tolerance. The average weekly dose delivered in the first 4 weeks was 150 million IU; at the end of 12 weeks this averaged 110 million IU/week; and by 24 weeks averaged 75 million IU/week.\nForty-four percent of asymptomatic patients responded versus 7% of symptomatic patients. The median time to response was approximately 2 months and 1 month, respectively, for asymptomatic and symptomatic patients. The median duration of response was approximately 3 months and 1 month, respectively, for the asymptomatic and symptomatic patients. Baseline T4/T8 ratios were 0.46 for responders versus 0.33 for nonresponders.\nIn another study, INTRON A doses of 35 million IU were administered subcutaneously, daily (QD), for 12 weeks. Maintenance treatment, with every other day dosing (QOD), was continued for up to 1 year in patients achieving antitumor and antiviral responses. The median time to response was 2 months and the median duration of response was 5 months in the asymptomatic patients.\nIn the 30 million IU study group, 7% (5/72) of patients were complete responders and 22% (16/72) of the patients were partial responders. The 35 million IU study had 13% (3/23 patients) complete responders and 17% (4/23) partial responders.\nFor patients who received 30 million IU TIW, the median survival time was longer in patients with CD4 greater than 200 (30.7 months) than in patients with CD4 less than or equal to 200 (8.9 months). Among responders, the median survival time was 22.6 months versus 9.7 months in nonresponders.\n\n【10】 ## Chronic Hepatitis C\nThe safety and efficacy of INTRON A in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C was evaluated in 5 randomized clinical studies in which an INTRON A dose of 3 million IU three times a week (TIW) was assessed. The initial three studies were placebo-controlled trials that evaluated a 6-month (24-week) course of therapy. In each of the three studies, INTRON A therapy resulted in a reduction in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in a greater proportion of patients versus control patients at the end of 6 months of dosing. During the 6 months of follow-up, approximately 50% of the patients who responded maintained their ALT response. A combined analysis comparing pretreatment and post-treatment liver biopsies revealed histological improvement in a statistically significantly greater proportion of INTRON A-treated patients compared to controls.\nTwo additional studies have investigated longer treatment durations (up to 24 months).Patients in the two studies to evaluate longer duration of treatment had hepatitis with or without cirrhosis in the absence of decompensated liver disease. Complete response to treatment was defined as normalization of the final two serum ALT levels during the treatment period. A sustained response was defined as a complete response at the end of the treatment period, with sustained normal ALT values lasting at least 6 months following discontinuation of therapy.\nIn Study 1, all patients were initially treated with INTRON A 3 million IU TIW subcutaneously for 24 weeks (run-in-period). Patients who completed the initial 24-week treatment period were then randomly assigned to receive no further treatment, or to receive 3 million IU TIW for an additional 48 weeks. In Study 2, patients who met the entry criteria were randomly assigned to receive INTRON A 3 million IU TIW subcutaneously for 24 weeks or to receive INTRON A 3 million IU TIW subcutaneously for 96 weeks. In both studies, patient follow-up was variable and some data collection was retrospective.\nResults show that longer durations of INTRON A therapy improved the sustained response rate . In patients with complete responses (CR) to INTRON A therapy after 6 months of treatment (149/352 ), responses were less often sustained if drug was discontinued (21/70 ) than if it was continued for 18 to 24 months (44/79 ). Of all patients randomized, the sustained response rate in the patients receiving 18 or 24 months of therapy was 22% and 26%, respectively, in the two trials. In patients who did not have a CR by 6 months, additional therapy did not result in significantly more responses, since almost all patients who responded to therapy did so within the first 16 weeks of treatment.\nA subset (less than 50%) of patients from the combined extended dosing studies had liver biopsies performed both before and after INTRON A treatment. Improvement in necroinflammatory activity as assessed retrospectively by the Knodell (Study 1) and Scheuer (Study 2) Histology Activity Indices was observed in both studies. A higher number of patients (58%, 45/78) improved with extended therapy than with shorter (6 months) therapy (38%, 34/89) in this subset.\nCombination treatment with INTRON A and REBETOL (ribavirin USP) provided a significant reduction in virologic load and improved histologic response in adult patients with compensated liver disease who were treatment-naïve or had relapsed following therapy with alpha interferon alone; pediatric patients previously untreated with alpha interferon experienced a sustained virologic response\n\n【11】 ### Adults\nThe safety and efficacy of INTRON A in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B were evaluated in three clinical trials in which INTRON A doses of 30 to 35 million IU per week were administered subcutaneously (SC), as either 5 million IU daily (QD), or 10 million IU three times a week (TIW) for 16 weeks versus no treatment. All patients were 18 years of age or older with compensated liver disease, and had chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (serum HBsAg positive for at least 6 months) and HBV replication (serum HBeAg positive). Patients were also serum HBV-DNA positive, an additional indicator of HBV replication, as measured by a research assay.All patients had elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and liver biopsy findings compatible with the diagnosis of chronic hepatitis. Patients with the presence of antibody to human immunodeficiency virus (anti-HIV) or antibody to hepatitis delta virus (anti-HDV) in the serum were excluded from the studies.\nVirologic response to treatment was defined in these studies as a loss of serum markers of HBV replication (HBeAg and HBV DNA). Secondary parameters of response included loss of serum HBsAg, decreases in serum ALT, and improvement in liver histology.\nIn each of two randomized controlled studies, a significantly greater proportion of INTRON A-treated patients exhibited a virologic response compared with untreated control patients . In a third study without a concurrent control group, a similar response rate to INTRON A therapy was observed. Pretreatment with prednisone, evaluated in two of the studies, did not improve the response rate and provided no additional benefit.\nThe response to INTRON A therapy was durable. No patient responding to INTRON A therapy at a dose of 5 million IU QD or 10 million IU TIW relapsed during the follow-up period, which ranged from 2 to 6 months after treatment ended. The loss of serum HBeAg and HBV DNA was maintained in 100% of 19 responding patients followed for 3.5 to 36 months after the end of therapy.\nIn a proportion of responding patients, loss of HBeAg was followed by the loss of HBsAg. HBsAg was lost in 27% (4/15) of patients who responded to INTRON A therapy at a dose of 5 million IU QD, and 35% (8/23) of patients who responded to 10 million IU TIW. No untreated control patient lost HBsAg in these studies.\nIn an ongoing study to assess the long-term durability of virologic response, 64 patients responding to INTRON A therapy have been followed for 1.1 to 6.6 years after treatment; 95% (61/64) remain serum HBeAg negative, and 49% (30/61) lost serum HBsAg.\nINTRON A therapy resulted in normalization of serum ALT in a significantly greater proportion of treated patients compared to untreated patients in each of two controlled studies . In a third study without a concurrent control group, normalization of serum ALT was observed in 50% (12/24) of patients receiving INTRON A therapy.\nVirologic response was associated with a reduction in serum ALT to normal or near normal (less than or equal to 1.5 × the upper limit of normal) in 87% (13/15) of patients responding to INTRON A therapy at 5 million IU QD, and 100% (23/23) of patients responding to 10 million IU TIW.\nImprovement in liver histology was evaluated in Studies 1 and 3 by comparison of pretreatment and 6-month post-treatment liver biopsies using the semiquantitative Knodell Histology Activity Index.No statistically significant difference in liver histology was observed in treated patients compared to control patients in Study 1. Although statistically significant histological improvement from baseline was observed in treated patients in Study 3 (P≤0.01), there was no control group for comparison. Of those patients exhibiting a virologic response following treatment with 5 million IU QD or 10 million IU TIW, histological improvement was observed in 85% (17/20) compared to 36% (9/25) of patients who were not virologic responders. The histological improvement was due primarily to decreases in severity of necrosis, degeneration, and inflammation in the periportal, lobular, and portal regions of the liver (Knodell Categories I + II + III). Continued histological improvement was observed in four responding patients who lost serum HBsAg and were followed 2 to 4 years after the end of INTRON A therapy.\n\n【12】 ### Pediatrics\nThe safety and efficacy of INTRON A in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B was evaluated in one randomized controlled trial of 149 patients ranging from 1 year to 17 years of age. Seventy-two patients were treated with 3 million IU/m2 of INTRON A therapy administered subcutaneously three times a week (TIW) for 1 week; the dose was then escalated to 6 million IU/m2 TIW for a minimum of 16 weeks up to 24 weeks. The maximum weekly dosage was 10 million IU TIW. Seventy-seven patients were untreated controls. Study entry and response criteria were identical to those described in the adult patient population.\nPatients treated with INTRON A therapy had a better response (loss of HBV DNA and HBeAg at 24 weeks of follow-up) compared to the untreated controls (24%  versus 10%  P=0.05). Sixteen of the 17 responders treated with INTRON A therapy remained HBV DNA and HBeAg negative and had a normal serum ALT 12 to 24 months after completion of treatment. Serum HBsAg became negative in 7 out of 17 patients who responded to INTRON A therapy. None of the control patients who had an HBV DNA and HBeAg response became HBsAg negative. At 24 weeks of follow-up, normalization of serum ALT was similar in patients treated with INTRON A therapy (17%, 12/72) and in untreated control patients (16%, 12/77). Patients with a baseline HBV DNA less than 100 pg/mL were more likely to respond to INTRON A therapy than were patients with a baseline HBV DNA greater than 100 pg/mL (35% versus 9%, respectively). Patients who contracted hepatitis B through maternal vertical transmission had lower response rates than those who contracted the disease by other means (5% versus 31%, respectively). There was no evidence that the effects on HBV DNA and HBeAg were limited to specific subpopulations based on age, gender, or race.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-05-08 01:37:59", "update_time": "2024-05-08 01:55:23"}

Alternative splicing of exon 5 gives rise to two alternate exons. The promoter has been identified 2.5 kilobase pairs (kb) upstream of the transcription start site, and the 5’- untranslated exons may enhance expression of the SCN1A gene in SH-SY5Y cells, a human cell line derived from a neuroblastoma.\nThe SCN1A gene codes for the alpha subunit of the voltage-gated sodium ion channel making it a member of ten paralogous gene families which code for the voltage-gated sodium transmembrane proteins NaV1.1. Within the family of genes which code for other portions of voltage-gated sodium channels, the SCN1A mutations were the first identified, since mutations to this gene caused epilepsy and febrile seizures. Indeed, the SCN1A gene is one of the most commonly mutated genes in the human genome associated with epilepsy, which has given it the title of a ‘super culprit gene’. There are 900 distinct mutations reported for the SCN1A gene, approximately half of the reported mutations are truncations which result in no protein. The remaining half of mutations are missense mutations, which are predicted to either cause loss-of-function or gain-of-function, though very few have been tested for functionality in the lab.\nSubtle differences in voltage-gated sodium ion channels can have devastating physiological effects and underlie abnormal neurological functioning. Mutations to the SCN1A gene most often results in different forms of seizure disorders, the most common forms of seizure disorders are Dravet Syndrome (DS), Intractable childhood epilepsy with generalized tonic-clonic seizures (ICEGTC), and severe myoclonic epilepsy borderline (SMEB). Clinically, 70-80% of patients with DS have identified mutations specific to the SCN1A gene, which are caused by de novo heterozygous mutations of the SCN1A gene There are currently two databases on SCN1A mutations, Infobase and the SCN1A variant database.\nMice with knock-in SCN1A mutations, who are model organisms for DS quickly develop seizures, indicative of a significant reduction in the function of NaV1.1. It has been hypothesized that reduced sodium currents due to NaV1.1 mutations may cause hyper-excitability in GABAergic inhibitory interneurons leading to epilepsy. Mice in both the homozygous and heterozygous states develop the seizure phenotype and ataxia. Though homozygous mice die on average during the second to third week of life and approximately 50% of heterozygous null mice survive into adulthood.\n- From a gene symbol: This is a redirect from a Human Genome Organisation (HUGO) symbol for a gene to an article about the gene.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-05-08 01:37:59", "update_time": "2024-05-08 18:59:18"}

When used in the cultural sense, the word deaf is very often capitalized in writing, and referred to as \"big D Deaf\" in speech.\nBig D Deaf communities do not automatically include all those who are clinically or legally deaf, nor do they exclude all hearing people. According to Anna Mindess, \"it is not the extent of hearing loss that defines a member of the Deaf Community but the individual's own sense of identity and resultant actions.\" As with all social groups that a person chooses to belong to, a person is a member of the Deaf community if he or she \"identifies him/herself as a member of the Deaf community, and other members accept that person as a part of the community.\"\nThe Deaf community typically includes individuals who communicate via sign language|signed languages, individuals who attended schools for the deaf, child of deaf adult|children of deaf parents, and sign language interpreters. Deaf communities also often possess social and cultural norms that are distinct from those of surrounding hearing communities.\n\n【1】 #Membership of Deaf communities\nDeaf communities are composed mostly, but not exclusively, of deaf individuals. The causes of deafness are rarely heritable, so these communities are unusual among cultural groups in that \"only 10 percent of the Deaf population acquires  from their Deaf families.\"\nDeaf culture is often acquired within schools for the deaf and within Deaf social clubs, both of which unite deaf people into communities with which they can identify. Becoming Deaf culturally can occur at different times for different people, depending on the circumstances of one's life.\n\n【2】 ## Children of deaf adults\nChildren of deaf adults (CODAs) with normal hearing ability may consider themselves, and be considered, culturally Deaf or as members of the Deaf community. In some cases they may need speech therapy due to limited exposure to spoken language. An organization, also called CODA, was established in 1983 and now holds annual conferences. There are also support groups for Deaf parents who may be concerned about raising their hearing children, as well as support groups for adult CODAs.\nThere are also several camps established for CODAs, such as the one at Camp Mark Seven which hosts two separate 2-week programs for CODAs, one from age 9 to 12 and one for CODAs from age 13 to 16 and it usually occurs during the summer, from the last week of June to mid-August.\n\n【3】 ## Diversity within Deaf culture\nAnna Mindess notes that there is \"not just one homogenous Deaf culture.\" There are many distinct Deaf communities around the world, which communicate using different sign languages and exhibit different cultural norms. Deaf identity also intersects with other kinds of identity|cultural identity. Within American Deaf culture for instance, there is African American Deaf culture, Gay and Lesbian Deaf culture, Deaf Women culture, Latino American Deaf culture, American Indian Deaf culture, among many others. The extent to which individuals identify primarily with their Deafness rather than their membership of other intersecting cultural groups also varies. Mindess notes a 1989 study, which \"found that 87 percent of black Deaf people polled identified with their Black culture first.\"\n\n【4】 ## Sign Languages\n\n【5】 ## Norms\nApart from using sign languages, Deaf culture has typical behaviors and manners that define its social norms.\n\n【6】 ### Norms of American Deaf Culture\n- The use of American Sign Language (ASL) is favoured over other manual languages such as Signing Exact English|Signed Exact English (SEE). ASL is a separate language from English and the Deaf community rejects English-like signing.\n- It is important to maintain a high awareness of all that is going on in one's environment and to help keep others similarly informed because \"deaf people do not have access to the noises that clue us in to what others are doing when out of view\"\n\n【7】 ### Rejection of cochlear implants\nWithin Deaf communities, there is strong opposition to the use of cochlear implants and sometimes also hearing aids and similar technologies. This is often justified in terms of a rejection of the view that deafness, as a condition, is something that needs to be 'fixed'.\nOthers argue that this technology also threatens the continued existence of Deaf culture, but Kathryn Woodcock argues that it is a greater threat to Deaf culture \"to reject prospective members just because they used to hear, because their parents chose an implant for them, because they find environmental sound useful, etc.\" Cochlear implants may improve the perception of sound for suitable implantees, but they do not reverse deafness completely.\n\n【8】 ### Rejection of oralism as a teaching method\nThere is strong opposition within Deaf communities to the oralism|oralist method of teaching deaf children to speak and lip reading|lip read with limited or no use of sign language in the classroom. The method is intended to make it easier for deaf children to integrate into hearing communities, but the benefits of learning in such an environment are disputed. The use of sign language is also central to Deaf identity and attempts to limit its use are viewed as an attack.\n\n【9】 ## The word \"deaf\"\nThe word \"deaf\" has different meanings in different contexts.\n\n【10】 ### Clinical and legal definitions\nIn a clinical context, the term \"deaf\" (written with a lower case d) refers to a physical condition characterized by a lack of auditory sensitivity to sound. Within the law, deafness is categorised by the degree of hearing loss. These degrees include profound or total deafness (90 dB - 120 dB or more of hearing loss), severe deafness (60 dB - 90 dB), moderate deafness (30 dB - 60 dB), and mild deafness (10 dB - 30 dB).\n\n【11】 ### Cultural definition\nIn a cultural context, the term \"Deaf\" (written with an upper case D) refers to cultural membership within a group that is composed mainly, but not exclusively, of individuals who are clinically deaf, who possess social norms which are distinct from those of the surrounding hearing community.\n\n【12】 ### Other meanings\nThe third line of Shakespeare's Sonnet 29 provides an example:\nWhen in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes\nI all alone beweep my outcast state,\nAnd trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,\nThe phrase \"tone deaf\" refers to someone who lacks relative pitch, or the ability to distinguish between musical notes.\n\n【13】 ## \"Deaf\", \"partially deaf\", \"hard of hearing\" and \"hearing-impaired\"\nThe term \"deaf\" generally implies a profound loss of hearing. Individuals with either severe or moderate deafness are commonly described as \"partially deaf\" or \"hard of hearing\", while those with mild deafness are commonly described as \"hard of hearing.\" People with varying degrees of hearing loss are also commonly described as \"hearing-impaired.\"\nThe term \"hard of hearing\" may be used to describe all degrees of hearing loss up to and including total deafness. It is more likely to be used by individuals who have acquired deafness in adulthood rather than by those who have grown up deaf. In the case of profound deafness, this may be political correctness, a euphemism for the simpler and more accurate \"deaf.\" Interestingly, this is seen as a euphemism only from the side of the mainstream. Members of the Deaf community do not generally aspire to be hearing and reject labels such as \"hard of hearing\" and \"hearing-impaired\" on the basis that they reflect the mindset that deafness is a pathological condition.\nTotal deafness is quite rare. Most deaf people can hear sounds at at least some frequencies, but a person's hearing may not be useful for spoken communication if he or she lacks sensitivity in the frequency range that is typical for speech.\nThose with some functional hearing generally do not associate with the Deaf community, and typically work and socialize with hearing people to the best of their ability. People with all degrees of hearing may encounter discrimination when looking for work, while at their jobs, or when socializing with hearing people.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-05-08 01:37:59", "update_time": "2024-05-08 19:00:14"}

Naloxone treatment increased agitation and hallucinations, and physostigmine treatment resolved the signs of toxicity.\nOn December 29, the New Jersey Poison Center (NJPC) informed all EDs in the state about the syndrome of severe anticholinergic toxicity associated with the use of \"Polo\" heroin. Later that day, after GC-MS testing of a sample of heroin obtained from a patient identified both heroin and scopolamine, the New Jersey Department of Health (NJDOH) held an emergency press conference to alert the public to this drug combination.\nNJDOH and NJPC identified a total of 61 persons with 1 recent histories of snorting or ingesting heroin with the street name \"Polo\" and 2 clinical manifestations of anticholinergic toxicity for which treatment had been provided at 13 EDs in the Newark metropolitan area during December 28-30, 1995. During December 31, 1995-June 1, 1996, NJPC was consulted 2-3 times each week about patients with similar conditions.\n\n【1】 #Philadelphia\nDuring February 19-21, 1996, a total of 12 patients who had injected or snorted heroin and had clinical manifestations of anticholinergic toxicity were treated in EDs at four hospitals in northeastern Philadelphia and reported to the Delaware Valley Poison Control Center (DVPCC). DVPCC estimated that in the Philadelphia area, during February 19-21, a total of 35 persons were treated for apparent combined scopolamine/ heroin overdose, and during March 15-May 5, six persons were treated.\nOn May 9, a total of 27 persons presented to one Philadelphia hospital ED between 4:30 p.m. and 11 p.m. because of drug overdoses after taking heroin (mostly by injection). Of these, 16 were admitted to the hospital for observation because of tachycardia, hallucinations, or semi-coma. In addition to these cases, DVPCC was consulted about apparent anticholinergic toxicity among 72 heroin users during May 9-11, and among 12 during May 22\n\n【2】 #Baltimore\nDuring May 10-12, 1996, a total of 22 persons presented to one hospital ED with clinical manifestations of anticholinergic toxicity. Although these persons reported taking heroin with street names of \"Homicide\" and \"Super Buick,\" GC-MS testing of a specimen identified scopolamine, quinine, and dextromethorphan but no heroin.\n\n【3】 #Testing of Heroin by the Drug Enforcement Administration\n\n【4】 -bscure the classical effects and differences. Although some of these patients improve dramatically with intravenous physostigmine therapy, such treatment should be administered only by experienced staff and with appropriate patient monitoring because of the potential for serious side effects, including seizures, bronchospasm, and bradycardia. For many patients, treatment may be restricted to sedation and observation, and manifestations may resolve over a period of hours. Naloxone remains the treatment of choice for coma and severe respiratory distress associated with possible drug overdose. Because of the complexities of both the diagnosis and treatment of patients with mental status changes and possible drug overdose, practitioners caring for such patients should consult their local poison-control center.\nSurveillance based on data from the system of poison-control centers in the Northeast was critical in recognizing the cause of this new type of drug overdose among heroin users and alerting health departments. The impact of the effects of these drug overdoses was limited further by timely recognition of the combined heroin and anticholinergic toxicity, use of sedation or physostigmine to treat the patients, and prompt investigation and reporting by state and local health departments. The continued occurrence of drug overdoses associated with use of scopolamine-containing heroin indicates the need for clinicians, public health programs, and organizations working with drug users to be aware of this problem; new cases should be reported promptly to the local poison-control center and health department.\n\n【5】 #Trends in Rates of Homicide -United States, 1985-19\nHomicide -Continued During 1993, a total of 26,009 homicides were reported in the United States; 71% were firearm-related, and one third of all homicides occurred among persons aged 15-24 years . Since 1985, national homicide rates have increased sharply, especially firearm-related homicides and homicides among persons aged 15-24 years. However, based on data from the Supplementary Homicide Report compiled by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and reports from some cities, homicide rates have been stable or declining since 1993. To examine this trend and to assess the relative contributions of firearm-and nonfirearm-related homicide to these recent changes, CDC analyzed national vital statistics data for 1985-1994. This report summarizes this analysis, which indicates that overall rates of homicide increased from 1985 to 1991 and decreased from 1992 to 1994, and that during these two periods, rates for total firearm-related homicides and homicide among persons aged 15-24 years increased then stabilized but remained at record-high levels.\n\n【6】 Quarterly homicide rates were analyzed using piecewise regression models to account for the observed changes in linear relations over time. Three time periods (1985-1987, 1988-1991, and 1992-1994) were selected for analysis based on a preliminary review of scatter plots of observed rates and their apparent changes in slopes. Statistical testing was conducted to determine whether the slope of the predicted values of the regression line (i.e. predicted rates) changed over each of these time periods. Statistical testing for a discontinuous piecewise regression model also was conducted to determine whether the rate changed significantly at the beginning of each new time period (i.e. \"jump point\"). No significant jump points were observed, and analyses consistently indicated that the slope of the regression line for 1985-1987 was similar to that for 1988-1991. Therefore, regression lines are presented only for two periods: 1985-1991 and 1992-1994. Overall results and interpretation of the piecewise model using two pieces are no different from those using a model with three pieces.\nDuring 1985-1991, the overall rate of homicide in the United States increased significantly  (slope=<0.1, 4% annually); during 1992-1994, the rate decreased significantly  (slope=-0.1, 1% annually) . During 1985-1991, nonfirearm-related homicide rates remained stable, and firearm-related homicide rates increased significantly . During 1992-1994, nonfirearm-related homicide rates declined significantly , and firearm-related homicide rates stabilized.\nAnalysis of firearm-related homicide rates by sex for persons aged 15-24 years indicates that rates for males and females reflected the overall trend for this age  1985 1986 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 Quarter and Year Symbol=Observed Line=Predicted *Per 100,000 population.\nFinal Mortality Statistics were used for 1985-1993. Current Mortality Sample was used for 1994. During 1985-1994, the percentage of firearm-related homicides among all homicides in the total population increased from 60% to 72% and among persons aged 15-24 years, from 67% to 87% . These increases illustrate that changes in overall homicide rates primarily reflect changes in firearm-related homicides. The stabilization of firearm-related homicide rates during 1992-1994-particularly among those aged 15-24 years-reflects a change from the increasing rates in previous years, even though rates remain at record-high levels. The findings in this report also indicate the usefulness of CMS data as a source of information for monitoring homicide in the United States. Because of the timely availability of CMS data and their accuracy in reflecting final mortality-based homicide rates, these data enable more timely analyses of temporal trends, objective policy formulation, and measurement of progress toward public health goals. The findings in this report are subject to at least two limitations. First, because of the small numbers based on CMS data, rates were not examined among age-, race-, and sex-specific subgroups. Second, estimates for some causes of death may be incomplete or skewed because reporting of the underlying cause of death data may not have been complete when the monthly sample was obtained (the data for this potential undercount are adjusted in the annual summary ).\nStrategies for preventing homicide and violence require integration of approaches from multiple disciplines, including criminal justice, education, social services, community advocacy, and public health. For example, public health approaches to prevent violence have focused on 1 changing individual knowledge, skills, and/or attitudes; 2 changing the social and physical environments; and 3 increasing community awareness of the causes and prevention of violence. The public health community also has recognized the influence of social class and poverty on violence. Communities increasingly are adopting programs emphasizing strategies to enhance the skills of youth and parents to reduce violence. These strategies include, for example, 1 school-based curricula that teach coping, communication, and mediation skills ; 2 family-intervention programs that focus on parental training to positively alter parental practices and family cohesion ; and 3 preschool efforts to develop intellectual and social skills . Because evaluation of prevention strategies is a critical component of public health interventions, CDC is evaluating the effectiveness of selected programs in reducing violent behavior and injury .\nHomicide and assaultive violence now are recognized as global public health problems. Although the U.S. homicide rate ranks higher overall and higher for males aged 15-24 years than those of other highly industrialized countries ; based on these data, BLS estimates the national incidence of work-related injuries and illnesses. For those injuries and illnesses resulting in lost work days, employers provide demographic information and data about the nature and circumstances of injuries and illnesses. Because employment data provided by employers were not stratified by age, injury and illness rates could not be calculated for specific age groups.\n\n【7】 #National Estimates\nIn 1993, persons aged <18 years incurred an estimated 21,620 injuries and illnesses involving lost work days. Of these, 24% involved 1 lost work day; 43%, 2-5 days; 13%, 6-10 days; 13%, 11-30 days; and 8%, ≥31 days (median: 3 days). Most (96%) injuries and illnesses occurred among persons aged 16-17 years, and males accounted for 59% of cases. Sprains/strains were the most commonly reported problem (31%), followed by cuts/lacerations (17%), contusions/abrasions (13%), heat burns (8%), and fractures/dislocations (5%).\nInjured and ill persons were employed most frequently by eating and drinking establishments (39%), followed by grocery stores (14%), nursing and personal-care facilities (6%), and department stores (5%). The most common occupations were food preparation and service workers (i.e. waiters and waitresses, cooks, and food counter and kitchen workers) (37%), followed by cashier (10%), stock handler or bagger (9%), health or nursing aide (7%), and janitor and cleaner (5%).\nCommon events resulting in injury included falls on the same level (i.e. falls to floors and falls onto or against objects) (21%), overexertion (i.e. from lifting, pulling, pushing, turning, wielding, holding, carrying, or throwing objects) (17%), striking against objects (i.e. bumping into, stepping on, kicking, and being pushed or thrown into or against objects) (10%), contact with hot objects or substances (9%), being struck by falling objects (7%), and being struck by a slipping hand-held object (e.g. knife, razor, or tool) (6%).\n\n【8】 #State-Specific Variations\n\n【9】 Safety and health regulations, such as those promulgated and enforced by OSHA, apply to workers of all ages. In addition, children aged <18 years are protected by provisions of child labor laws. For example, federal child labor laws specifically prohibit cooking and baking by persons aged 14-15 years ; however, in this analysis, one third of cases among children aged 14-15 years occurred among persons identified as cooks. During 1983-1990, 1475 serious injuries among persons aged <18 years were associated with violations of federal child labor laws , and studies during the 1980s suggest that 38%-86% of work-related deaths among children were associated with activities prohibited by federal child labor laws .\nThe risks for work-related injuries and illnesses among workers of all ages can be reduced through adherence to routine precautions such as prescribed housekeeping practices; training and safe work procedures; use of proper shoes, gloves, and protective clothing; and maintenance and use of equipment with safety features. In addition, workers aged 15 pounds more often than once per minute or ever to lift objects >30 pounds; tasks involving continuous lifting should never last more than 2 hours . Children aged <18 years should not participate in work requiring routine use of respirators (a means of protecting workers from inhaling hazardous substances) . Employers should be knowledgeable about and comply with child labor laws, and school guidance counselors and physicians who sign work permits for children also should be familiar with child labor laws and ensure that the work they approve does not involve prohibited activities.\nMost persons aged <18 years enter the workplace with minimal prior experience for a job. During the summer of 1992, more than half (54%) of persons aged 14-16 years treated in emergency departments for work injuries reported that they had received no training in prevention of the injury they sustained and that a supervisor was present at the time of injury in only approximately 20% of the cases . Differences in maturity and developmental level regarding learning styles, judgement, and behavior should be considered when providing training for youth in occupational safety and health.\n\n【10】 #Background\n\n【11】 The average risk for HIV infection from all types of reported percutaneous exposures to HIV-infected blood is 0.3% . In the case-control study , risk was increased for exposures involving 1 a deep injury to the health-care worker, 2 visible blood on the device causing the injury, 3 a device previously placed in the sourcepatient's vein or artery (e.g. a needle used for phlebotomy), or 4 a source-patient who died as a result of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) within 60 days postexposure (and therefore was presumed to have a high titer of HIV) . Identification of these risk factors in the case-control study suggests that the risk for HIV infection exceeds 0.3% for percutaneous exposures involving a larger blood volume and/or higher HIV titer in blood. The risks after mucous membrane and skin exposures to HIV-infected blood (on average, approximately 0.1% and <0.1%, respectively ) probably also depend on volume of blood and titer of HIV. The risk is probably higher for skin contact that is prolonged, involves an area that is extensive or in which skin integrity is visibly compromised, and/or involves a higher HIV titer.\nAlthough information about the potency and toxicity of antiretroviral drugs is available from studies of HIV-infected patients, it is uncertain to what extent this information can be applied to uninfected persons receiving PEP. In HIV-infected patients, combination therapy with the nucleosides ZDV and lamivudine (3TC) has greater antiretroviral activity than ZDV alone and is active against many ZDV-resistant HIV strains without significantly increased toxicity . Adding a protease inhibitor provides even greater increases in antiretroviral activity; among protease inhibitors, indinavir (IDV) is more potent than saquinavir at currently recommended doses and appears to have fewer drug interactions and short-term adverse effects than ritonavir . Few data exist to assess possible long-term (i.e. delayed) toxicity resulting from use of these drugs in persons not infected with HIV.\nIn currently recommended doses, ZDV PEP usually is tolerated well by health-care workers; short-term toxicity associated with higher doses primarily includes gastrointestinal symptoms, fatigue, and headache , whether 3TC causes fetal toxicity is unknown.\n\n【12】 The following recommendations are provisional because they are based on limited data regarding efficacy and toxicity of PEP and risk for HIV infection after different types of exposure. Because most occupational exposures to HIV do not result in infection transmission, potential toxicity must be carefully considered when prescribing PEP. When possible, these recommendations should be implemented in consultation with persons having expertise in antiretroviral therapy and HIV transmission. Changes in drug regimens may be appropriate, based on factors such as the probable antiretroviral drug resistance profile of HIV from the source patient; local availability of drugs; and medical conditions, concurrent drug therapy, and drug toxicity in the exposed worker. These recommendations were not developed to address nonoccupational (e.g. sexual) exposures. 1. Chemoprophylaxis should be recommended to exposed workers after occupational exposures associated with the highest risk for HIV transmission. For exposures with a lower, but nonnegligible risk, PEP should be offered, balancing the lower risk against the use of drugs having uncertain efficacy and toxicity. For exposures with negligible risk, PEP is not justified . Exposed workers should be informed that a knowledge about the efficacy and toxicity of PEP is limited; b for agents other than ZDV, data are limited regarding toxicity in persons without HIV infection or who are pregnant; and c any or all drugs for PEP may be declined by the exposed worker. 2. At present, ZDV should be considered for all PEP regimens because ZDV is the only agent for which data support the efficacy of PEP in the clinical setting.TC should usually be added to ZDV for increased antiretroviral activity and activity against many ZDV-resistant strains. A protease inhibitor (preferably IDV because of the characteristics summarized in this report) should be added for exposures with the highest risk for HIV transmission . Adding a protease inhibitor also may be considered for lower risk exposures if ZDV-resistant strains are likely, although it is uncertain whether the potential additional toxicity of a third drug is justified for lower risk exposures. For HIV strains resistant to both ZDV and 3TC or resistant to a protease inhibitor, or if these drugs are contraindicated or poorly tolerated, the optimal PEP regimen is uncertain; expert consultation is advised  . 3. PEP should be initiated promptly, preferably within 1-2 hours postexposure. Although animal studies suggest that PEP probably is not effective when started later than 24-36 hours postexposure , reflecting the increasing rate of viral replication during later stages of the illness.\n\n【13】 #Workers with occupational exposures to HIV should receive follow-up counseling\nand medical evaluation, including HIV-antibody tests at baseline and periodically for at least 6 months postexposure (e.g. 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 6 months), and should observe precautions to prevent possible secondary transmission . If PEP is used, drug-toxicity monitoring should include a complete blood count and renal and hepatic chemical function tests at baseline and 2 weeks after starting PEP. If subjective or objective toxicity is noted, dose reduction or drug substitution should be considered with expert consultation, and further diagnostic studies may be indi- *Any exposure to concentrated HIV (e.g. in a research laboratory or production facility) is treated as percutaneous exposure to blood with highest risk.  Recommend-Postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) should be recommended to the exposed worker with counseling . Offer-PEP should be offered to the exposed worker with counseling . Not offer-PEP should not be offered because these are not occupational exposures to HIV .  Regimens: zidovudine (ZDV), 200 mg three times a day; lamivudine (3TC), 150 mg two times a day; indinavir (IDV), 800 mg three times a day (if IDV is not available, saquinavir may be used, 600 mg three times a day). Prophylaxis is given for 4 weeks. For full prescribing information, see package inserts.  Highest risk-BOTH larger volume of blood (e.g. deep injury with large diameter hollow needle previously in source patient's vein or artery, especially involving an injection of source-patient's blood) AND blood containing a high titer of HIV (e.g. source with acute retroviral illness or end-stage AIDS; viral load measurement may be considered, but its use in relation to PEP has not been evaluated). Increased risk-EITHER exposure to larger volume of blood  blood with a high titer of HIV. No increased risk-NEITHER exposure to larger volume of blood NOR blood with a high titer of HIV (e.g. solid suture needle injury from source patient with asymptomatic HIV infection). Possible toxicity of additional drug may not be warranted .\nIncludes semen; vaginal secretions; cerebrospinal, synovial, pleural, peritoneal, pericardial, and amniotic fluids. For skin, risk is increased for exposures involving a high titer of HIV, prolonged contact, an extensive area, or an area in which skin integrity is visibly compromised. For skin exposures without increased risk, the risk for drug toxicity outweighs the benefit of PEP.\n\n【14】 #Contributors to the Production of the MMWR (Weekly)\nWeekly", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": "无关文本#14#14#Contributors to the Production of the MMWR (Weekly) \nWeekly", "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-05-08 01:37:59", "update_time": "2024-05-08 21:58:09"}

LSE is a term used for sterile and verrucous vegetations around the heart valves mostly affecting the mitral and aortic heart valves but other valves may also be involved. Valvular involvement in LSE may lead to valvular regurgitation, aortic insufficiency, thromboembolic cerebrovascular events, and increased risk of infective endocarditis. It is also usually associated with the other autoimmune diseases such as antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) and some malignancies. Secondary APS has a higher rate of cardiac involvement as compared to primary APS, mostly due to the autoimmune causes related to the SLE. LSE can be complicated by embolic cerebrovascular disease, superimposed infective endocarditis, and peripheral arterial embolism. It is also associated with increased mortality, hence, early recognition of LSE and appropriate treatment are of significant importance in preventing any further complications.\n\n【2】 #Historical Perspective\n- In 1888, Zeigler was the first one to describe NBTE, and called it \"thromboendocarditis\" at that time.\n\n【3】 Venous and/or arterial thrombosis\nRecurrent pregnancy loss\nPresence of antiphospholipid antibodies\n- In 1989, four groups highlighted a probable role of antiphospholipid antibodies in the pathogenesis of valvular heart disease in SLE patients.\n\n【4】 ## Pathology\n- The pathology of Libman-Sacks endocarditis is the same as nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis except that focal necrosis  is only found in Libman-Sacks endocarditis.\n- Just like NBTE, Libman-Sacks endocarditis develops due to the endothelial damage and subsequent exposure of the sub-endothelial connective tissue to the circulating platelets.\n- The vegetations in Libman-Sacks endocarditis are formed from the strands consisting of the following four components:\nFibrin\nNeutrophils\nLymphocytes\nHistiocytes\n- Most commonly affected valve is the mitral valve with the vegetations involving the ventricular and atrial surface of the valve.\n\n【5】 ## Gross pathology\n- Vegetations in Libman-Sacks endocarditis have the following typical features:\nSmall\nFriable\nWhite or tan masses\n< 1 cm in diameter\nIrregular\nBroad based\nUsually involve the lines along the valve closure on leaflets (which may be normal or previously damaged)\nVary from tiny lesions to large, exuberant masses\n\n【6】 ## Microscopic Pathology\n- Vegetations in Libman-Sacks endocarditis consist of degenerating platelets interwoven with the fibrin strands and form a bland, featureless eosinophilic mass except for a few trapped leukocytes.\n- Following three stages have been described in the evolution of vegetations in Libman-Sacks endocarditis:\n\n【7】 #Epidemiology and Demographics\n- Approximately 1 out of 10 SLE patients have vegetations associated with Libman-Sacks endocarditis. Presence of these vegetations is indicative of the association with the following:\nLupus duration\nDisease activity\nAnticardiolipin antibodies\nAPS manifestations\n- There's a variable incidence of positive findings on transthoracic echocardiography.\n- Higher incidence of detection of positive findings is shown with transesophageal echocardiography and especially with higher frequency with positive antiphospholipid antibodies.\n- Positive findings on echocardiography are found in approximately one-third of the patients with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome.\n- These positive findings are five to nine times more frequently found in women than men.\n- Libman-sacks endocarditis typically occurs in young women, however, children can be rarely involved.\n- Nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE) is a rare condition which is most often found during 0.9% to 1.6% of the postmortem studies.\n- NBTE affects every age group but most commonly involves patients between the fourth and eighth decades of life with no sex predilection.\n- According to one autopsy study, patients with underlying malignancy have a higher rate (1.25%) of NBTE as compared to general population (0.2%).\n- NBTE is found at higher rates in patients with adenocarcinoma (e.g. lung, colon, ovary, biliary and prostate) (2.7%) as compared to other malignancies (0.47%), with the highest rates observed in patients with mucin-secreting and pancreatic adenocarcinoma (10%).\n- Observational studies in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus have reported 6% to 11% prevalence rates with transthoracic echocardiography, with higher rates (43%) observed with more sensitive transesophageal echocardiography.\n\n【8】 #Risk Factors\n\n【9】 ## Complications\n- Systemic emboli may occur in Libman-Sacks endocarditis but not very commonly with the risk being much higher with mitral stenosis and subsequent atrial fibrillation.\n- It is difficult to predict the underlying etiology in case of a stroke occurrence in LSE, whether it is due to systemic emboli or the underlying pathology of SLE or APS.\n- Valvular disease in LSE can lead to the heart failure.\n- Double-valve Libman-Sacks endocarditis involving both mitral and aortic valves can lead to ventricular fibrillation and cardiac arrest.\n- There's 1% to 2% chance of congenital heart block (usually complete,or 1st or 2nd degree) in a baby of mother with SLE associated with anti-Ro/SS-A (Sjögren's syndrome antigen A) autoantibodies with a 16% recurrence rate. Fluorinated steroids that do not cross the placenta may be beneficial in preventing the congenital heart block.\n\n【10】 ## Prognosis - All of the SLE patients have got a shorter life span.\n- The occurrence of cardiovascular events is the major cause of mortality in SLE patients as SLE is a risk factor for premature & accelerated coronary atherosclerosis and CAD (coronary artery disease) due to the following associated factors:\nHypertension\nHyperlipidemia\nChronic inflammation\nChronic glucocorticoids use\n\n【11】 #Diagnosis - Diagnosis of Libman-Sacks endocarditis requires a high degree of clinical suspicion especially in patients who don't improve clinically after being treated for infective endocarditis.\n- Mckay and Wahler proposed the following triad for the diagnosis of NBTE:\n\n【12】 #History and Symptoms\n- Mostly patients with Libman-Sacks endocarditis are asymptomatic.\n- There may be the features of valvular disease if valves are severely affected with the mitral valve disease being more common than the aortic valve disease.\n- Valvular regurgitation is more frequent than the valvular stenosis.\n- Unusually, the tricuspid or pulmonary valves are involved.\n- Systemic embolism may also occur with the effects depending upon the destination of the emboli with the brain and kidneys being more likely involved.\n- Emboli can also lead to the blockage of peripheral circulation.\n- The vegetations in Libman-Sacks endocarditis are mostly sterile but secondary infective endocarditis can also occur.\n\n【13】 #Physical Examination\n\n【14】 ## Cardiac Catheterization\n- In case of severe valvular disease, cardiac catheterization may be required with a view to valve replacement.\n\n【15】 #Treatment\n- There is no specific treatment for Libman-Sacks endocarditis.\n- Treatment of LSE is quite difficult with the main focus being on the correction of the underlying cause.\n\n【16】 #Differentiating Libman-Sacks Endocarditis from other Diseases\nLibman-Sacks endocarditis should be differentiated from other diseases presenting with fever, chest pain and anorexia. The differentials include the following:\n- Nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis (Marantic endocarditis)\n- Vasculitis - Temporal arteritis - Myocardial abscess\n- Connective tissue disease\n- Fever of unknown origin (FUO)\n- Intra-abdominal infections\n- Septic pulmonary infarction", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": "语义不完整#6#6#Libman-Sacks endocarditis:后面缺少内容\n语义不完整#11#11#diagnosis of NBTE:后面缺少内容", "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-05-08 01:37:59", "update_time": "2024-05-08 19:24:08"}

Pertussis results in substantial morbidity among adults and adolescents whose immunity to past childhood vaccination or B. pertussis infection might have waned and who have not received booster immunization for pertussis with adult tetanus, reduced diphtheria, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine .\n\n【2】 Vaccinating adults and adolescents using Tdap reduces the burden of pertussis among vaccine recipients and might prevent transmission of B. pertussis to infants .\nIn 2006, ACIP recommended routine administration of Tdap for postpartum women who were not vaccinated previously with Tdap to provide personal protection and reduce the risk for transmitting pertussis to their infants . Health-care providers can monitor pregnant women who have not received a dose of Tdap for exposures to pertussis or to respiratory illness consistent with pertussis, and they can administer antimicrobials for postexposure prophylaxis or treatment of pertussis, if needed, to reduce the risk for transmitting pertussis to their infants.\nThis report provides the background and rationale for routine administration of Tdap in postpartum women who were not vaccinated previously with Tdap and for maintaining the previous recommendation for use of Td in pregnant women if indicated. The safety and efficacy of using Tdap in pregnant women has not been demonstrated, and Tdap is not recommended for use in pregnant women in any country. No evidence exists of excess morbidity or any fatality among pregnant women ascribed to pertussis. No evidence exists demonstrating whether\n- Tdap in pregnant women harms the fetus or increases risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes, - transplacental antibody induced by Tdap administered during pregnancy will protect infants against pertussis, or - Tdap-induced transplacental maternal antibody will have a negative impact on an infant's protective immune response to later-administered routine pediatric DTaP or to conjugate vaccines containing tetanus toxoid or diphtheria toxoid. This report discusses certain situations in which health-care providers might choose to administer Tdap to a pregnant woman. Health-care providers should weigh the theoretical risks and benefits before choosing to administer Tdap vaccine to a pregnant woman.\n\n【3】 #Methods\nDuring June 2006, ACIP evaluated the limited evidence available concerning safety, immunogenicity, and pregnancy outcomes after administration of Tdap; evidence from historic use of pertussis, tetanus, and diphtheria vaccines in pregnant women; and the potential effects of transplacental maternal antibody on the infant's immune response to active immunization with pediatric diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and whole-cell pertussis (DTP) or DTaP vaccines, or to con-jugate vaccines containing tetanus toxoid or diphtheria toxoid. The evaluation included a synthesis of information from scientific literature published in English, unpublished sources of information, consultations, analyses, and extensive discussion by an ACIP working group  during . The working group comprised persons with expertise in pertussis, tetanus, and diphtheria; obstetrics and gynecology; pediatrics, family practice, internal medicine, immunology, public health, and vaccine regulation; and liaison members from partner organizations.\n\n【4】 Routine\nIn a Canadian study conducted in 1999, a source was identified in 60%-70% of adults and adolescents with pertussis. Among adults aged 18-39 years, the source was a person in the household in 25%-44% of cases or at work or school in 17%-25% of cases. Among adolescents aged 12-17 years, the source was a person in the household in 9% of cases and a friend or person at school or work in 51% of cases .\n\n【5】 #Pertussis During Pregnancy\nCase reports suggest that the morbidity of pertussis is not increased among pregnant women compared with nonpregnant women. In a general medical practice during 1979-1980, four pregnant women had onset of cough during the 12th, 14th, 14th, and 36th week of gestation and cough that lasted 36, 6, 8, and 6 weeks, respectively; two women had vomiting after coughing and worsening cough paroxysms at night; and one woman developed hemoptysis and subconjunctival hemorrhage after repeated and forceful coughing paroxysms . A 1993 case report described a pregnant woman who was hospitalized 6 days before delivery for severe paroxysms and posttussive emesis . In a series of 32 women who had pertussis during pregnancy or at term, the illness was characterized as \"a very tiresome disease\"; no obstetric complication was reported, and no infant was premature . No pertussis-related deaths have been reported in pregnant women. The source of pertussis in infected pregnant women has not been examined systematically.\nReports of fetal morbidity among pregnant women with pertussis are rare, and no causal relationship with abnormal fetal development, fetal morbidity, or adverse outcome of pregnancy has been confirmed. One fetus of a mother who had severe paroxysmal coughing early in pregnancy had an extradural hematoma that was identified by ultrasonography and magnetic resonance at 31 weeks' gestation; studies had been normal at 12 and 22 weeks' gestation . Another fetus of a mother who had pertussis during the first trimester had prenatal diagnosis of laryngotracheal obstruction .\n\n【6】 #Infantile Pertussis\nInfants aged <12 months typically have the most severe pertussis, often requiring hospitalization for respiratory or other complications  ,8. The risk for pertussis death or severe pertussis is highest among infants in the first 6 months of life and remains elevated until infants have received 1-2 doses of pediatric DTaP .\nComplications and deaths from infant pertussis have been characterized by necrotizing bronchiolitis  and high rates of primary or secondary pneumonia and/or coinfection with bacterial and viral pathogens .\nSince the 1970s, parents, especially mothers, have been identified as the most important source of infant pertussis; however, a source has been identified in only 30%-60% of cases investigated 34,38,42,48. One or more household contact with pertussis is the source of pertussis in approximately 75% of cases among infants aged <6 months for whom the source is identified. A parent is implicated in approximately 25% of cases in infants, including the mother in 16%-19% of cases. A sibling is implicated as the source of transmission in <10% of cases .\nMathematical modeling evaluating different vaccine strategies for the United States has suggested that pertussis vaccination of 90% of household contacts (children, adolescents, and adults) of newborns, in addition to pertussis vaccination of 75% of adolescents generally in the population, might prevent approximately 75% of pertussis cases among infants aged 0-23 months . Another model estimated vaccination of both parents of an infant before discharge from the hospital could prevent 38% of infant cases and deaths . However, the efficacy of these strategies in practice has not been evaluated.\n\n【7】 #Disease Burden\nAlthough pertussis is a nationally notifiable disease in the United States , data on the pregnancy status of women with pertussis have not been collected. However, the burden of pertussis among pregnant women is likely to be similar to the burden among other adults in the population. Pertussis reports typically demonstrate increases in activity every 3-4 years ; aside from these cycles of activity, the number of reported cases of pertussis in the United States has increased gradually since 19\n\n【8】 #Transmission in Obstetric and Neonatal Health-Care Settings\nHealth-care personnel can transmit B. pertussis in health-care settings if pertussis has not been considered by hospital staff .\nPercentage risk for transmission to infants, pregnant women, and healthcare personnel and have been associated with outbreaks in these settings .\n\n【9】 #Diagnosis\nThe diagnosis of pertussis is complicated by the limitations of currently available diagnostic tests.\n\n【10】 #Culture\nCulture to isolate B. pertussis is essential for identifying the organism early in the course of disease  and for antimicrobial susceptibility testing, if indicated. Isolation of B. pertussis by culture is 100% specific; for optimal yield, culture requires specimens that contain nasopharyngeal cells obtained by aspirate or nasopharyngeal swab and special medium for growth. The sensitivity of culture early in pertussis varies (range: 30%-60%) . Outside of infancy, the yield of B. pertussis declines to 1%-3% in specimens taken in the third week of cough illness or later, after starting antimicrobial treatment, or in a patient who was vaccinated previously .\n\n【11】 #Polymerase Chain Reaction\nDNA amplification (e.g. PCR) to detect B. pertussis has increased sensitivity and more rapid turnaround time . When symptoms of classic pertussis are present (e.g. >2 weeks of paroxysmal cough), PCR can be two to three times more likely than culture to detect B. pertussis in a known positive sample .\nAlthough PCR testing for pertussis has been available for nearly 20 years , no U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-licensed PCR test kit is available. The analytical sensitivity, accuracy, and quality control of PCR-based B. pertussis tests vary widely among laboratories. PCR assays used by the majority of laboratories amplify a single gene sequence, typically within the insertion sequence IS481. Both false-positive and false-negative results have been reported with these assays; reported outbreaks of respiratory illness mistakenly attributed to pertussis have resulted in unnecessary investigation and treatment, and unnecessary chemoprophylaxis of contacts ,112. Using more than one genetic target and consensus interpretation criteria for PCR diagnosis of pertussis  and to allow discrimination between Bordetella species.\n\n【12】 #Other Diagnostic Tests\nDirect fluorescent antibody (DFA) tests provide rapid results (within hours), but sensitivity (10%-50%) is less than with culture . With use of monoclonal reagents, the specificity of DFA should be >90%. However, interpretation of the test is subjective, and, when interpreted by an inexperienced microbiologist, the specificity can be lower . Diagnosis of pertussis by serology requires a substantial change in titer for pertussis antigens (typically fourfold) from acute (4 weeks after the acute sample). The results typically become available too late in the course of the illness to be useful clinically. Singlesample serologic tests for antipertussis toxin (anti-PT) IgG have been developed for research purposes; sera must be col-lected at least 2 weeks after the onset of symptoms . Pertussis serology assays using commercial reagents are available, but these assays are not validated clinically and do not differentiate between recent and remote infection and vaccination . No serologic assay is licensed by FDA for routine diagnostic use in the United States.\n\n【13】 #Postexposure Prophylaxis and Treatment\nA macrolide (erythromycin, azithromycin, or clarithromycin) is the preferred antimicrobial for postexposure prophylaxis and treatment of pertussis . Antimicrobial treatment administered in the early (catarrhal) phase of the illness can modify the severity of the symptoms .\nPregnant women with pertussis near term and other household contacts with pertussis are an important source of pertussis for newborn infants .\nPregnancy is not a contraindication for use of erythromycin, azithromycin, or clarithromycin. Erythromycin and azithromycin are listed as FDA Category B drugs, and clarithromycin is listed as a Category C drug . Macrolides can interact with a variety of other therapeutic agents, precluding concurrent use. Although macrolides can have gastrointestional side effects (e.g. nausea and vomiting), serious side effects (e.g. hepatic dysfunction or pseudomembranous colitis) are rare . Infants aged <1 month who receive erythromycin are at increased risk for infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis ,83. For this reason, and because azithromycin is associated with fewer adverse effects than erythromycin, azithromycin is the preferred antimicrobial for prophylaxis of neonates exposed to pertussis . Infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis has been reported in two preterm infants who received azithromycin for postexposure prophylaxis  between infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis and azithromycin has not been established.\n\n【14】 #Immunity to Pertussis\nThe mechanisms of protection against pertussis are incompletely understood. On the basis of studies in animals and humans, both humoral and cellular immunity are believed to play a complementary role . The protection that results from B. pertussis infection or pertussis vaccines persists for an estimated 5-10 years or more. Protection wanes over time, leaving persons susceptible to infection or reinfection ,4,75.\n\n【15】 #Humoral Immunity to Pertussis Vaccine Antigens\nImmune responses to B. pertussis can be directed variably against a range of pertussis toxins and antigens. No level of antibody, presence of specific antibodies, or antibody profile has been accepted universally as a quantifiable serologic measure of protection ,139,141. Studies of parenterally administered immune globulins for postexposure prophylaxis  report mixed results and do not clarify the role of passive antibodies in prevention or treatment of pertussis. By extrapolation, these results do not help predict the role of transplacental maternal antibodies in infant protection.\nPertussis toxin (PT), previously called lymphocytosis promoting factor (LPF), is considered one of the most important of a range of clinically relevant toxins and virulence factors of B. pertussis (including pertactin or 69-kDa protein , fimbriae types 2 and 3 , filamentous hemagglutinin ) ,140,142,152,157. Detoxified PT is a component of all pertussis vaccines. The preventive efficacy of a pediatric DTaP vaccine containing detoxified PT as the only immunizing antigen was 71% (95% confidence interval  = 63%-78%) against classical pertussis . However, the contribution to protection by anti-PT varied in analyses of the humoral immune responses to specific vaccine antigens when evaluated in two household studies. Elevated concentrations of anti-PRN and anti-FIM were associated most closely with protection in these .\n\n【16】 #Cellular Immunity to Pertussis Vaccine Antigens\nCell-mediated immune mechanisms clear B. pertussis from within macrophages and other cells ,52,139. In addition to humoral immune responses, B. pertussis antigens in acellular pertussis vaccines induce cell-mediated immune responses  after primary immunization with pediatric DTaP among infants .\n\n【17】 #Prevalence of Pertussis-Specific Antibodies: Pregnant Women and their Infants\nAlthough the importance of antipertussis activity in sera relative to protection remains uncertain, studies conducted since the 1930s have determined the prevalence of antipertussis activity in sera from mothers and infants using multiple assays  ,37,154. Detectable pertussisspecific antibodies have been identified in unvaccinated women without a history of pertussis .\nThe efficiency of maternal-fetal transfer of IgG antibodies to pertussis-specific antigens varies; the majority of investigators report similar antigen-specific concentrations in cord or neonatal infant sera and in maternal sera measured late in pregnancy or at delivery , but higher concentrations in cord or neonatal sera than in maternal sera have been reported, which might indicate active transport in certain settings  .\n\n【18】 #Kinetics of Pertussis Booster Vaccination in Nonpregnant Adults and Adolescents\nThe majority of adults and adolescents have had exposure to B. pertussis, pertussis antigen-containing vaccines, or both, and they will have a booster response to vaccination with pertussis antigens .\n\n【19】 #Vaccinating Pregnant Women against Pertussis Tdap\nNo prelicensure studies were conducted with Tdap in pregnant women. In 2005, to increase understanding of the safety of Tdap in relationship to pregnancy, both Tdap manufacturers established registries to solicit voluntary reports of pregnant women who received Tdap during pregnancy or who received Tdap and were determined subsequently to be pregnant .\nAs of December 31, 2007, GlaxoSmithKline had received five reports of pregnancy exposure to BOOSTRIX  within 28 days before conception or during any trimester of pregnancy, including two in the first trimester, one in the second trimester, and two during an unknown trimester. Among the two first-trimester exposures, one subject delivered a normal infant at 33 weeks' gestation, and one subject was lost to followup. Of the remaining exposures, information on the outcome of two pregnancies was not yet available, and one subject was lost to follow-up (GlaxoSmithKline, unreported data, 2008).\nAs of November 23, 2007, sanofi pasteur had received 107 spontaneous reports and 47 reports from postlicensing surveillance studies of exposure to ADACEL  during pregnancy. For these 154 reports, pregnancy outcomes were 68 live infants ,including 64 term deliveries ,one with a congenital  .\n\n【20】 #Whole-Cell Pertussis Vaccine\nFive clinical trials conducted during the 1930s and 1940s evaluated vaccinating pregnant women with whole-cell per-May 30, 2008 tussis vaccine as a strategy to increase the levels of maternal pertussis-specific antibodies transferred to their infants via the placenta  . The protective efficacy of the vaccine against pertussis in the women was not a consideration. Whole-cell pertussis vaccine was prepared from sterile extracts of killed B. pertussis. To maximize the passive transfer of maternal antibody, pregnant women were vaccinated with 2-6 doses at 1-to 2-week intervals during the third trimester.\nLocal reactions to vaccination in the pregnant women were common, some of which were severe. Systemic reactions were uncommon, adverse pregnancy outcomes were not reported  .\nThe majority of women had substantial rise in titer to B. pertussis antigens in postvaccination sera compared with prevaccine titers  .\nIn subsets of infants in two studies, the duration of detectable transplacental pertussis antibodies was followed among unvaccinated infants .\n\n【21】 #Infant Protection by Transplacental Maternal Antibody\nThe role of transplacental maternal antibody in infant protection against pertussis remains uncertain. Prevaccine era observations concluded that infants have no \"congenital immunity\" and are susceptible to pertussis from the \"day of birth,\" with the possible exception of an infant whose mother had pertussis during pregnancy .\nTwo retrospective surveys were conducted after early vaccine trials in pregnant women to assess infant protection .\n\n【22】 #Inhibitory Effect of Transplacental Maternal Antibody on Infant Immunization\nTransplacental maternal antibodies to pertussis antigens can interfere with the infant's response to active immunization with the pertussis components of pediatric DTP and pediatric DTaP . A proposed mechanism for the interference with pertussis and other vaccine antigens is maternal antibody binding to vaccine antigens, masking the vaccine antigens from the infant's B cells. Infant antigen-presenting cells also might take up maternal antibody-vaccine antigen complexes stimulating selective T-cell responses without humoral immune responses to the vaccine antigens . The concentrations and specificities of the maternal antibodies for vaccine-antigen epitopes contributes to the degree of interference ,221. The inhibitory effect of transplacental maternal antibody can be detectable for a few weeks or for more than 1 year ,221,222. As transplacental maternal antibody declines over time, a threshold is reached when the infant's immune system responds to vaccine antigens in subsequent doses. In theory, the threshold concentration of residual maternal antibody could be lower than the concentration of antibody needed for infant protection, but this concentration is not known for pertussis. In this setting, a theoretical window of \"relative susceptibility\" exists for the infant until the infant mounts a humoral immune response to a subsequent dose of vaccine .\n\n【23】 #Interference with Pertussis Responses to Pediatric DTP\nSubstantially lower concentrations of infant IgG anti-PT result after 3 doses of pediatric DTP among infants with \"high\" (variably defined) prevaccination levels of maternal IgG anti-PT, than among infants with \"low\" or no measurable prevaccination level of maternal IgG anti-PT ,195. The post-dose 3 concentrations of infant anti-PT in one study were 28% or 56% lower with each doubling of the concentration of transplacental maternal anti-PT, respectively, for the two DTP products studied  . The reductions in post-dose 3 concentrations also were significant for anti-FIM (18% lower) and agglutinins (15% lower) for one DTP product, and for anti-FHA (16% lower) for the other DTP product, with each doubling of the concentration of the specific transplacental maternal antibodies  .\n\n【24】 #Interference with Pertussis Responses to Pediatric DTaP\nTransplacental maternal IgG anti-PT might interfere less with infant responses after 3 doses of pediatric DTaP than  Titers of >1:320 have been reported to correlate with protection in some studies .\nafter pediatric DTP .\n\n【25】 #Noninterference with Pertussis Cellular Immune Responses to Pediatric DTP or DTaP\nInfants who have relatively poor humoral immune responses to active immunization with whole-cell or acellular pertussis vaccine in the presence of inhibitory concentrations of transplacental maternal antibody have evidence of T-cell priming for booster (anamestic) responses .\n\n【26】 #Lactation\nExisting data do not provide evidence that human colostral pertussis antibodies contribute to infant protection, although pertussis-specific antibodies present in the mother are found in colostral milk .\n\n【27】 #Tetanus\nTetanus is caused by Clostridium tetani spores, which are ubiquitous in the environment. Spores enter the body through disrupted skin or mucus membranes. When inoculated into oxygen-poor sites (e.g. necrotic tissue or wounds), C. tetani spores germinate to vegetative bacilli that elaborate tetanospasmin, a potent neurotoxin. More than 80% of cases of tetanus are of the generalized syndrome; the remaining cases are localized or cephalic. Persons with generalized cases typically have trismus (lockjaw), followed by rigidity and painful contractions of the skeletal muscles that can impair respiratory function. Glottic spasm, respiratory failure, and autonomic instability can result in death. The onset of tetanus typically is within 7 days of the injury (range: 0-112 days) The course of tetanus is up to 4 weeks or longer, followed by a prolonged period of convalescence .\n\n【28】 #Obstetric and Neonatal Tetanus\nObstetric tetanus is defined as tetanus during pregnancy or with onset within 6 weeks after the termination of pregnancy . Obstetric tetanus occurs after contamination of wounds or abrasions during pregnancy or after unclean deliveries or abortions. In a review covering 1941-1990, an estimated 65%-80% of cases of obstetric tetanus occurred in the puerperal or postpartum period; the majority of the other cases occurred after surgical or spontaneous abortions .\nNeonatal tetanus (tetanus neonatorum) is associated with contamination of the umbilical stump. In nearly all cases of infant tetanus, onset occurs in the first month of life. Symptoms commonly begin at 3-14 days of life and are characterized by increasing irritability and difficulty feeding. Signs of neonatal tetanus are similar to tetanus in older age groups. Case-fatality rates vary (range: 10%-100%) .\n\n【29】 #Burden\nTetanus is a nationally notifiable disease in the United States . In 2006, a total of 41 cases were reported. No cases occurred among women aged 15-19 years or those aged 30-39 years. One case occurred among women aged 20-29 years, and three cases occurred among women aged 40-49 years. None of the women died. During 1972-2006, case reporting forms did not collect information regarding pregnancy; however, no case of obstetric tetanus was identified among more than 1,000 reports to NNDSS (CDC, unpublished data, 2006). In 1999, tetanus-specific coding became available in CDC's mortality database; no case of tetanusassociated obstetric death was reported through 2005, the most recent year for which data are available (CDC, unpublished data, 2008).\nDuring the 1950s, approximately 100 neonatal tetanus deaths were reported annually in the United States, and neonates comprised more than one third of tetanus deaths in all age groups .\n\n【30】 #Diagnosis and Treatment\nThe diagnosis of tetanus is clinical and is supported by a compatible setting, immunization history, and exclusion of other possible diseases. Anaerobic cultures of tissues or aspirates for C. tetani typically are not positive. Low or undetectable levels of serum antitoxin at the time of onset are compatible with the diagnosis of tetanus, but higher levels of antitoxin do not exclude the diagnosis .\nTreatment of tetanus is directed at neutralizing unbound toxin with administration of human tetanus immune globulin, removing the source of infection through debridement, and use of an antimicrobial (e.g. metronidazole). The control of rigidity and spasms, attendant respiratory and autonomic dysfunction and their complications, and maintaining nutrition require careful and sustained attention that is best provided in intensive-care settings with specialty consultation .\n\n【31】 #Immunity to Tetanus\nThe level of antitoxin that protects against obstetric and neonatal tetanus can vary with the wound characteristics, the degree of contamination, the specificity of the antitoxin, and the type of assay employed to measure the antitoxin level . The minimum level of antitoxin correlating with protection is 0.01 IU/mL as measured by in vivo neutralization assay. An antitoxin concentration at >0.1 IU/mL is the preferred correlate of protection based on the results of other assays (e.g. enzyme-linked immunoabsorbant assay ), and because higher concentrations of antitoxin might be necessary to protect in certain circumstances .\n\n【32】 #Deferring Td During Pregnancy to Substitute Tdap in the Immediate Postpartum Period\nEnsuring maternal and neonatal tetanus protection as part of prenatal care is a priority for women who are due for a recommended decennial tetanus and diphtheria toxoids booster dose. For women who have not received a dose of Tdap previously, administering Td during pregnancy, followed in a few months by Tdap postpartum, theoretically could increase the risk or severity of adverse reaction, which typically is local. Moderate to severe local reactions have been associated with high levels of tetanus and diphtheria antitoxin . In these women, deferring the Td booster during pregnancy to substitute Tdap in the immediate postpartum period may be considered to boost protection against pertussis as well as tetanus and diphtheria. The majority of women of childbearing age who have lived in the United States since infancy or childhood have received 4-5 infant and childhood doses of tetanus toxoid with pediatric DTP or DTaP and >1 booster dose of Td (or tetanus toxoid without diphtheria toxoid ) in accordance with national recommendations .\nIn 2004, women aged 15-39 years accounted for 97% of all births in the United States . Data from a populationbased serosurvey conducted nationwide in the United States during 1988-1994 documented tetanus antitoxin concentrations at >0.15 IU/mL among >80% of women aged 12-39 years . However, when combined with the small number of tetanus cases among women of childbearing age in the United States, these studies suggest that when pregnant women have previously received the recommended schedule of tetanus and diphtheria toxoids vaccinations, a routine decennial Td booster during pregnancy typically can be deferred so Tdap can be substituted at delivery or before discharge from the hospital or birthing center.\n\n【33】 #Vaccinating to Prevent Obstetric and Neonatal Tetanus\nSuccess in preventing obstetric and neonatal tetanus relies on antitoxin being present at delivery . In countries where access to childhood vaccines is limited, neonatal tetanus constitutes a major cause of infant mortality; during 1978-1985, an estimated 800,000 neonatal tetanus deaths occurred annually worldwide . In 1974, worldwide elimination of neonatal tetanus (less than one case per 1,000 live births) through vaccine initiatives became a major focus of the Expanded Program of Immunization of the World Health Organization (WHO) . The initiative promoted clean deliveries and tetanus toxoid vaccination for pregnant women. Nonpregnant women of childbearing age also were targeted for at least 3 doses of tetanus toxoid vaccine in supplemental immunization activities.\nThe strategy of targeting pregnant women for vaccination to prevent neonatal tetanus was based on reports published in the 1960s concerning two vaccine trials that demonstrated that >2 doses of tetanus toxoid administered during pregnancy were >95% effective in preventing neonatal tetanus  .\nAlthough the burden of obstetric tetanus has not been characterized as well as the burden of neonatal tetanus, the annual worldwide burden of obstetric tetanus deaths has been esti-mated at 15,000-30,000, accounting for approximately 5% of all maternal deaths in the 1990s .\n\n【34】 #Safety of Tetanus Vaccination During Pregnancy\nNo evidence suggests that adverse outcomes for a mother or fetus increase after tetanus toxoid is administered to a pregnant woman .\n\n【35】 #Infant Protection by Transplacental Maternal Antibody\nTetanus toxoid is one of the most immunogenic protein antigens in any vaccine. Administration of 2 doses of tetanus toxoid to pregnant women at least 4-6 weeks before delivery stimulates antitoxin that protects the mother and readily crosses the placenta, thereby protecting the newborn against tetanus when the risk is highest . Pregnant women who receive a booster dose of tetanus toxoid have a measurable immune response within 5 days and a peak response in <2 weeks. The response to vaccination might be slower after a first (primary) dose or when the interval after the most recent booster dose is long .\n\n【36】 #Inhibitory Effect of Transplacental Maternal Antibody on Infant Immunization\nTransplacental maternal tetanus antitoxin can interfere with the infant response to active immunization after up to 3 doses of tetanus toxoid (e.g. in pediatric DTP, DTaP, or DT) ,222,230. Certain studies .\n\n【37】 #Lactation\nNo substantial difference in the infant immune response to tetanus toxoid (in DTP) has been identified with consumption of human milk compared with consumption of cow milk .\n\n【38】 #Diphtheria\nRespiratory diphtheria is an acute, severe infection caused by strains of Corynebacterium diphtheriae that produce diphtheria toxin. Rarely, toxin-producing strains of C. ulcerans cause a diphtheria-like illness . Respiratory diphtheria is characterized by a grayish-colored adherent membrane on the pharynx, palate, or nasal mucosa that can obstruct the airway with fatal outcome. The disease can be complicated by toxinmediated cardiac, neurologic, or renal dysfunction. Casefatality rates are >10% .\n\n【39】 #Obstetric and Neonatal Diphtheria\nRespiratory diphtheria  or vulvovaginal infection .\n\n【40】 #Burden\nRespiratory diphtheria is a nationally notifiable disease in the United States. Rare cases occur in the United States after infection with diphtheria toxin-producing strains of C. diphtheriae or other corynebacteria .\n\n【41】 #Diagnosis and Treatment\nThe diagnosis of diphtheria is confirmed by isolation of C. diphtheriae in culture of the adherent membrane and by testing the isolate for toxin production . Antibiotics are administered to limit transmission and to prevent continuing production of diphtheria toxin . Prompt reporting of suspect cases, investigation, culture, and antimicrobial prophylaxis of contacts and immunization of the affected community .\n\n【42】 #Diphtheria Immunity\nProtection against respiratory diphtheria is predominantly from IgG antibody to diphtheria toxin (antitoxin) induced after infection with toxin-producing C. diphtheriae or after vaccination with diphtheria toxoid. In areas with little or no endemic exposure to toxin-producing C. diphtheriae, periodic vaccination is required to maintain immunity ,237,286,307. Although the immune responses to infection and vaccination vary, antitoxin concentrations of >0.1 IU/mL typically are considered protective. Concentrations of 0.01 IU/mL-0.1 IU/mL might provide protection against severe disease; concentrations <0.01 IU/mL do not protect against diphtheria .\n\n【43】 #Td Booster During Pregnancy for Diphtheria Protection\nData from a national population-based serosurvey conducted during 1988-1994 that evaluated the prevalence of immunity to diphtheria (defined as a diphtheria antitoxin concentration of >0.1 IU/mL) among women in the United States determined immunity to diphtheria to be lower than immunity to tetanus . The prevalence of immunity to diphtheria decreased with increasing age (77% among women aged 12-19 years, 74% among women aged 20-29 years, 65% among women aged 30-39 years, and 40 years) and with birth outside the United States or less formal education .\n\n【44】 Diphtheria toxoid vaccine trials conducted among pregnant women in the 1940s demonstrated quantitative increases in diphtheria antitoxin after the women were vaccinated. Maternal antitoxin was transferred efficiently to the fetus .\n\n【45】 #Safety\nThe safety of diphtheria toxoid (without tetanus toxoid) vaccination in pregnant women was examined during the 1970s . After diphtheria toxoid was administered during the first 4 months of pregnancy, 75 mother-child pairs were followed for malformations until the child reached age 7 years. Although the number of vaccinated pregnant women studied was small, the risk for malformations in their children was lower than the risk among children in a much larger group of mother-child pairs in which the women were not vaccinated with diphtheria toxoid during pregnancy (survival-and race-standardized relative risk: 0.88) .\n\n【46】 #Inhibitory Effect of Transplacental Maternal Antibody on Infant Immunization\nTransplacental maternal diphtheria antitoxin concentrations of 3 infant doses of high-content diphtheria toxoid vaccine when maternal antitoxin concentrations are >1.0 IU/mL in cord sera .\n\n【47】 #Lactation\nConsumption of human milk does not affect the infant immune response to diphtheria toxoid-containing vaccines .\n\n【48】 #Adult and Adolescent Acellular Pertussis Combined with Tetanus and Reduced Diphtheria Toxoids (Tdap) Vaccines and Tetanus and Reduced Diphtheria Toxoids (Td) Vaccines\nBoth Tdap vaccines used in the United States (ADACEL  and BOOSTRIX  ) were licensed on the basis of clinical trials in the United States demonstrating immunogenicity not inferior to that of U.S.-licensed Td .\nIn prelicensure trials, data on local and systemic adverse events were collected using standard diaries for the day of vaccination and the next 14 consecutive days ,212,213. The efficacies of the tetanus toxoid and the diphtheria toxoid components of Tdap were inferred from the immunogenicity of the antigens in Tdap compared with Td using established serologic correlates of protection in sera obtained before and approximately 1 month after vaccination. Because no wellaccepted serologic or laboratory correlate of protection is available for pertussis, the efficacy of the pertussis components of Tdap was inferred using a serologic bridge (comparison) to the immune response to vaccine antigens among infants who received 3 doses of pediatric DTaP (made by the same manufacturer) during clinical efficacy trials for pertussis during the 1990s . The efficacy against pertussis of an acellular pertussis vaccine without tetanus and diphtheria toxoids was 92% (CI = 32%-99%) for adults and adolescents in a randomized, controlled trial ; these results were not considered in the evaluation of Tdap for licensure in the United States.\nSelected results from the prelicensure trials are summarized below\n\n【49】 #ADACEL\nADACEL  contains the same tetanus toxoid, diphtheria toxoid, and five pertussis antigens as those in DAPTACEL  (pediatric DTaP, also made by sanofi pasteur), but ADACEL  is formulated with reduced quantities of diphtheria toxoid and detoxified PT. Prelicensure trials in the United States evaluated the immunogenicity and the safety of ADACEL  among adults aged 18-64 years and among adolescents aged 11-17 years, randomized to receive a single dose of ADACEL  or a single dose of Td made by the same manufacturer  . Pregnant women were excluded.\n\n【50】 #Immunogenicity\nTetanus and Diphtheria Toxoids. The rates of seroprotection and booster response for both antitetanus and antidiphtheria among adults and adolescents who received a single dose of ADACEL  were noninferior to rates among those who received Td. Nearly all (>99%) subjects in the ADACEL  and Td groups achieved seroprotective antitetanus levels (>0.1 IU/mL), and >94% of adults and >99% of adolescents achieved seroprotective antidiphtheria levels (>0.1 IU/mL) in ADACEL  and Td groups .\nPertussis Antigens. The efficacy of the pertussis components was inferred by comparing the immune responses (GMCs) of adults and adolescents vaccinated with a single dose of ADACEL  to those of infants vaccinated with 3 doses of DAPTACEL  in a Swedish vaccine efficacy trial .\n\n【51】 #Safety\nThe safety of ADACEL  was evaluated in four clinical studies with data from 2,448 adults aged 18-64 years and 3,393 adolescents aged 11-17 years .\nImmediate Events. No anaphylaxis was reported. Five adults reported an immediate event within 30 minutes of vaccination (four persons  for ADACEL  and one person  for Td); three of these five events were classified as nervous system disorders (hypoesthesia/paresthesia). Eleven adolescents reported an immediate event (six persons  for ADACEL  and five persons  for Td); these events included dizziness, syncope, or vasovagal reactions in addi-May 30, 2008 tion to pain and erythema at the injection site. All events resolved without sequelae .\nSolicited Local and Systemic Adverse Events. Rates of erythema and swelling , or systemic (headache, generalized body aches, and tiredness ) adverse events reported to occur during 0-14 days following vaccination with Td or Tdap were similar .\nSerious Adverse Events. Among adults, serious adverse events (e.g. appendicitis) within 6 months after vaccination were reported for 33 (2%) of 1,752 persons in the ADACEL  group and for 11 (2%) of 573 persons in the Td group .\n\n【52】 #Simultaneous Administration of Tdap with Other Vaccines\n\n【53】 #BOOSTRIX\nBOOSTRIX  contains the same tetanus toxoid, diphtheria toxoid, and three pertussis antigens as those in INFANRIX  (pediatric DTaP, also made by GlaxoSmithKline), but BOOSTRIX  is formulated with reduced quantities of antigens. Prelicensure trials conducted in the United States evaluated the immunogenicity and safety of BOOSTRIX  among adolescents aged 10-18 years . Pregnant adolescents were excluded.\n\n【54】 #Immunogenicity\nTetanus and Diphtheria Toxoids. The rates of seroprotection and booster response for both antitetanus and antidiphtheria among adolescents who received a single dose of BOOSTRIX  were noninferior to those who received Td. All adolescents had seroprotective antitetanus levels (>0.1 IU/mL); >99% of adolescents had seroprotective antidiphtheria levels (>0.1 IU/mL) .\nPertussis Antigens. The efficacy of the pertussis components was inferred by comparing the immune responses of adolescents vaccinated with a single dose of BOOSTRIX  with the immune responses of infants vaccinated with 3 doses of INFANRIX  in a German vaccine efficacy trial .\n\n【55】 #Safety\nA total of 3,080 adolescents aged 10-18 years received BOOSTRIX  in the primary safety study . No immediate events (i.e. those occurring within 30 minutes of vaccination) were reported .\n\n【56】 #Solicited Local and Systemic Adverse Events.\nNo substantial differences were observed between the BOOSTRIX  and Td recipients in the rates of solicited local (redness, swelling, and increase in arm circumference above baseline)  or systemic (headache, fatigue, gastrointestinal systemic events, fever >100.4°F  ) adverse events .\nSerious Adverse Events. Serious adverse events within 6 months after vaccination were reported among 14 (0.4%) of 3,005 adolescents vaccinated with BOOSTRIX  and two (0.2%) of 1,003 adolescents vaccinated with Td. All events were reported by the investigators to be unrelated to the study vaccine .\n\n【57】 #Pregnant Women Vaccinated with Tdap\nPregnant women were excluded from prelicensure trials of Tdap. The outcome of pregnancy among six women who were administered ADACEL  inadvertently during or within 1 month of conception was a healthy full-term infant (n = 3), a preterm infant (n = 1), or a miscarriage (n = 2). No infant was born with a congenital anomaly (sanofi-pasteur, unreported data, 2007). Two pregnancies occurred in BOOSTRIX  recipients >4 months postvaccination; one subject experienced a spontaneous abortion within the first trimester, and the other subject delivered a healthy infant .\n\n【58】 #Regulatory Considerations for Tdap in Pregnant Women\nAs with the majority of vaccines, Tdap is labeled pregnancy category C. This designation indicates that no adequate and well-controlled studies have been conducted with the vaccine in pregnant women to determine the product's safety .\n\n【59】 #Safety Considerations for Adult and Adolescent Use of Td or Tdap\nPrelicensure studies in nonpregnant adults and adolescents evaluated the safety of Tdap with respect to local and systemic adverse events . Registries have been established by both Tdap manufacturers for reporting women vaccinated with Tdap during pregnancy.\n\n【60】 #Interval between Td and Tdap\nACIP has made several recommendations for intervals between tetanus toxoid-and diphtheria toxoid-containing vaccines that balance the benefits of protection against the risks of moderate and severe local reactions. Moderate and severe local reactions, including Arthus reaction, are associated with frequent dosing at short intervals and larger doses of toxoid. High antitoxin levels are more likely to result when the interval between doses is short and the number of doses increases . High preexisting antibody titers to tetanus or diphtheria toxoids also are associated with increased rates and severity of local reactions to booster doses in adults ,349.\nACIP recommends a 10-year interval for routine administration of Td (e.g. decennial Td booster), and a 5-year interval for Td when indicated for wounds management .\nSeveral studies have suggested that an interval as short as 2 years between Td and a single dose of Tdap is acceptably safe. Three studies conducted among Canadian children and adolescents evaluated the safety of Tdap (ADACEL  ) at an interval shorter than 5 years after Td or after pediatric DTP or DTaP . The largest was an open-label study of 7,001 students aged 7-19 years. Rates of local reactions were not increased among students who had received the most recent of 5 pediatric DTP or DTaP doses, or a Td dose, >2 years before Tdap, compared with >10 years before Tdap . The other Canadian studies demonstrated similar safety when Tdap was administered at an interval of <5 years after the previous tetanus toxoid-and diphtheria toxoid-containing vaccine .\nAdverse reactions after Tdap (ADACEL  ) administered at an interval of 2 years (n = 1,792) or 2 years after the most recent dose of Td; causality was not assessed. The events were a case of Guillain-Barré syndrome (not requiring hospitalization) with onset 11 days after Tdap, a case of anaphylaxis-like reaction with onset 6 days after Tdap, and a case of eosinophilic nephritis with onset 6 days after Tdap in a health-care worker with a history of a renal transplant .\n\n【61】 #Important Local Reactions Arthus Reaction\nArthus reaction (type III hypersensitivity reaction) can occur after tetanus toxoid-or diphtheria toxoid-containing vaccines .\n\n【62】 #Extensive Limb Swelling\nExtensive limb swelling reactions have been reported to VAERS following administration of Td .\n\n【63】 #Neurologic and Systemic Events Pertussis Components\nConcerns regarding a possible role of pertussis vaccine components in causing neurologic reactions or exacerbating underlying neurologic conditions in infants and children are long-standing  in adults and adolescents.\nThe possibility that Tdap would complicate neurologic evaluation of chronic progressive neurologic disorders that are stable in adults (e.g. dementia) is of limited clinical concern and does not constitute a reason to delay administration of Tdap . Unstable or evolving neurologic conditions (e.g. cerebrovascular events or acute encephalopathic conditions) would be reason to delay administration of Tdap until the condition has stabilized . Among adolescents who have progressive or uncontrolled underlying neurologic disease, concerns regarding administering Tdap must be weighed against the morbidity from pertussis, which could be severe . ACIP does not consider a history of well-controlled seizures or a family history of seizures (febrile or afebrile) or other neurologic disorder to be a contraindication or precaution to vaccination with pertussis components .\n\n【64】 #Tetanus Toxoid Component\nACIP considers Guillain-Barré syndrome within 6 weeks after receipt of a tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine to be a precaution  for administration of subsequent tetanus toxoid-containing vaccines . Although IOM concluded that evidence favored acceptance of a causal relation between tetanus toxoidcontaining vaccines and Guillain-Barré syndrome on the basis of a single well-documented case .\n\n【65】 #Economic Considerations\nNo study has evaluated the disease morbidity and societal costs associated with pertussis among pregnant women or modeled the cost benefit or cost effectiveness of a Tdap strategy that includes vaccination of pregnant women. The morbidity and societal cost of pertussis in adults is substantial .\nCost-benefit and cost-effectiveness analyses of adult Tdap vaccination have varied in their results .\n\n【66】 #Implementing Tdap Preconception Assessments\nAdministering a dose of Tdap during routine wellness visits of adult and adolescent women of childbearing age, if indicated, is the most effective programmatic strategy to ensure that women are protected against pertussis in addition to tetanus and diphtheria and minimizes any theoretical effect of vaccination on infant immune responses should the woman become pregnant  ,1. Because Tdap contains only toxoids and purified bacterial components, women who receive Tdap do not need to wait after vaccination to become pregnant . Assessments provide repeated opportunities for documenting the history of past doses of Td (or TT) and any serious adverse reactions to tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis vaccines. To access and maintain immunization records, statebased immunization information systems (IIS) are increasingly becoming available to clinicians and public health officials. These confidential, computerized information systems, which consolidate vaccination data from multiple health-care providers, can generate reminder and recall notifications, assist with vaccine management and adverse events reporting, and capture lifespan vaccination histories . Additional guidance regarding administration of vaccines during routine assessments, record keeping, vaccine storage, and related topics has been published previously .\n\n【67】 #Prenatal Visits: Deferring Td During Pregnancy to Substitute Tdap in the Immediate Postpartum Period\n\n【68】 Health-care providers can monitor pregnant women for respiratory illness consistent with pertussis or for recent exposure to pertussis, either to themselves or to family members, and prescribe a macrolide antimicrobial for treatment of pertussis or postexposure prophylaxis, if indicated. Women and their partners should receive counseling regarding the severity of infant pertussis and ACIP's recommendation for a single dose of Tdap for adults and adolescents who anticipate contact with an infant . Ideally, health-care providers delivering prenatal care will encourage persons likely to have contact with an infant, including child care providers, to receive Tdap first.\nWhen pregnant women who have not received Tdap have indications for tetanus or diphtheria booster protection (>10 years since the most recent Td), ACIP recommends receipt of Td during pregnancy . ACIP has developed criteria for safely deferring administration of Td until delivery among women who have received past tetanus toxoidcontaining vaccinations, so the majority of these women can substitute Tdap in the immediate postpartum period for Td during pregnancy . When the history of tetanus toxoid vaccination for the women is uncertain or lacking, health-care providers can determine the con-centration of tetanus antitoxin to ensure protective concentrations of tetanus antitoxin (>0.1 IU/mL by ELISA). Because diphtheria is rare in the United States, serologic screening for diphtheria antitoxin typically is not necessary. A woman who anticipates travel to an area in which diphtheria is endemic can improve protection against diphtheria by receiving a booster dose of Td during pregnancy or a dose of Tdap postpartum. Serologic screening to establish immunity to pertussis is not useful.\nIn special situations in which a pregnant woman has increased risk for tetanus, diphtheria, or pertussis, ACIP acknowledges that health-care providers may choose to administer Tdap instead of Td during pregnancy to add protection against pertussis, after discussing the theoretical benefits and risks for her, her fetus, and the pregnancy outcome with the woman before vaccination . Data to inform this decision are scarce. No theoretical risk for harm to the mother or fetus exists from Tdap, and administration of Tdap in the pregnant woman might provide a degree of early protection to the infant against pertussis. However, a theoretical risk for the infant is that the dose of Tdap in pregnancy might not result in early protection against pertussis or could increase transplacental pertussis-specific antibodies to levels that would have a negative effect on the infant's response to immunization with pediatric DTaP or with conjugate vaccines containing tetanus toxoid or diphtheria toxoid (e.g. Haemophilus influenzae type b pneumococcal conjugate vaccine) . Health-care providers who choose to vaccinate pregnant women with Tdap are encouraged to report such administration to the manufacturers' pregnancy registry.\n\n【69】 #Postpartum Tdap\nIn 2004, a reported 99% of live births in the United States occurred in a hospital. Of out-of-hospital live births, 27% occurred at a free-standing birthing center and 65% at a residence . In these settings, attendants can implement protocols to ensure that postpartum women who have not received Tdap previously receive it before discharge. They also can encourage previously unvaccinated adults and adolescents who anticipate contact with an infant to receive Tdap. Tdap vaccination of the women and potential contacts before discharge rather than at a follow-up visit has the advantage of decreasing the time when new mothers and contacts of the newborns could acquire and transmit pertussis to the infants .\nVaccination of parents and household contacts of premature infants has been advocated to ensure that such persons receive Tdap . Premature and low birth weight infants are at increased risk for severe and complicated pertussis. The case-fatality rate for pertussis is increased compared with term infants, and premature infants might respond less well than term infants to initial doses of DTaP vaccine because of comorbidities or treatments (e.g. dexamethasone) ,47,53.\nParents should be reminded of other measures to protect infants from pertussis. To the extent feasible, parents can limit infant exposures to persons who have respiratory illness until they are determined to be noninfectious .\n\n【70】 In special situations, administration of Tdap during pregnancy might be warranted for pregnant women who were not vaccinated previously with Tdap. Health-care providers who choose to administer Tdap to pregnant women should discuss with the women the potential risks and benefits of immunization including the lack of data on Tdap administered during pregnancy or its unknown effects on active immunization of their infant\n\n【71】 For women who have not received Tdap previously (including women who are breastfeeding), Tdap is recommended as soon as feasible in the immediate postpartum period to protect the women from pertussis and reduce the risk for exposing their infants to pertussis. The postpartum Tdap should be administered before discharge from the hospital or birthing center. If Tdap cannot be administered at or before discharge, the dose should be administered as soon as feasible thereafter. Elevated levels of pertussis antibodies in the mother are likely within 1-2 weeks after vaccination.\nAlthough an interval of 10 years since receipt of the most recent Td dose is recommended for the next routine Td booster, to reduce the risk for women exposing their infants to pertussis, an interval as short as 2 years between the most recent Td and administering Tdap  is suggested for postpartum women.\nThe safety of such an interval is supported by three Canadian studies among adolescents and by a study among nonpregnant adult health-care personnel ,215, an interval shorter than 2 years may be used . In this setting, the benefit of Tdap to protect against pertussis typically outweighs the risk for local and systemic reactions after vaccination. Routine postpartum Tdap recommendations are supported by evidence from randomized controlled clinical trials, nonrandomized open-label trials and a retrospective survey, observational studies, and expert opinion .\n\n【72】 #1-B. Dosage and Administration\nThe dose of Tdap or, if indicated, the dose of Td is 0.5 mL, administered intramuscularly (IM), preferably into the deltoid muscle.\n\n【73】 #1-C. Simultaneous Vaccination with Tdap and Other Vaccines\nIf two or more vaccines are indicated, they typically should be administered during the same visit (i.e. simultaneous vaccination). Each vaccine should be administered using a separate syringe at a different anatomic site. Certain experts recommend administering no more than two injections per muscle, separated by at least one inch. Administering all indicated vaccines during a single visit increases the likelihood that pregnant and postpartum women will receive recommended vaccinations .\n\n【74】 #1-D. Interchangeable Use of Tdap Vaccines\nA single dose of ADACEL  may be used for adults aged 19-64 years, and a single dose of either ADACEL  or BOOSTRIX  may be used for adolescents aged 11-18 years, regardless of the type or manufacturer of pediatric DTP or pediatric DTaP used for childhood vaccination.\n\n【75】 #1-E. Preventing Adverse Events\nAttention to proper immunization technique, including use of an appropriate needle length and standard routes of administration (i.e. IM for Td and Tdap) might minimize the risk for adverse events. Guidance for administration of vaccines is available .\nSyncope can occur after vaccination and might be more common among young adults and adolescents than among other age groups. Syncope rarely has resulted in serious injury ,23. Vaccine providers should strongly consider observing patients for 15 minutes after they are vaccinated .\n\n【76】 The potential for administration errors involving tetanus toxoid-containing vaccines  and other vaccines is welldocumented . Pediatric DTaP and pediatric diphtheria toxoid and tetanus toxoid vaccine (DT) formulations indicated for use in children aged 6 weeks-6 years should not be administered to adults or adolescents; these vaccines can be associated with more severe local reactions than adult formulations  are licensed and recommended for adolescents aged 11-18 years. Providers should review product labels before administering these vaccines. If pediatric DTaP is administered inadvertently to an adult or adolescent, or if BOOSTRIX  is administered inadvertently to an adult aged >19 years, the dose should be counted as the Tdap dose, and the person should not receive an additional dose of Tdap. Adults or adolescents who receive PPD instead of Tdap should receive a dose of Tdap.\n\n【77】 #1-G. Record Keeping\nHealth-care providers who administer vaccines to adults and adolescents are required to keep permanent vaccination records of vaccines covered under the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Compensation Act. ACIP has recommended that this practice include all vaccines . Encouraging adults and adolescents to maintain a personal vaccination record is important to minimize administration of unnecessary vaccinations. Ideally, the personal vaccine record will document the type of the vaccine, manufacturer, anatomic site, route, and date of administration, and the name of the administering facility .\n\n【78】 #2-A. Contraindications\nThe following conditions are contraindications for Td or Tdap:\n- Td and Tdap are contraindicated for persons with a history of serious allergic reaction (i.e. anaphylaxis) to any component of the vaccine. Because of the importance of tetanus vaccination, persons with a history of anaphylaxis to components included in any Td or Tdap vaccines should be referred to an allergist to determine whether they have a specific allergy to tetanus toxoid and whether they can safely receive TT vaccination. - Tdap (but not Td) is contraindicated for adults and adolescents with a history of encephalopathy (e.g. coma or prolonged seizures) not attributable to an identifiable cause within 7 days of administration of a vaccine with pertussis components. This contraindication is for the pertussis components, and these persons should receive Td instead of Tdap.\n\n【79】 #2-B. Precautions and Reasons to Defer Td or Tdap\nA precaution is a condition in a vaccine recipient that might increase the risk for a serious adverse reaction\n\n【80】 #2-C. Conditions Under Which Td or Tdap May Be Administered If Otherwise Indicated\nThe following conditions are not contraindications or precautions for Td or Tdap:\n- stable neurologic disorder, including well-controlled seizures, a history of a seizure disorder that has resolved, or cerebral palsy; - brachial neuritis after a previous dose of tetanus toxoidor diphtheria toxoid-containing vaccine; - a history of an extensive limb swelling reaction that was not an Arthus hypersensitivity reaction after pediatric DTP or DTaP or after Td; - immunosuppression, including persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (the immunogenicity of Tdap in persons with immunosuppression has not been studied and could be suboptimal); - breastfeeding; - intercurrent minor illness; and - use of antimicrobials. Latex allergies other than anaphylactic allergies (e.g. a history of contact allergy to latex gloves) are not a contraindication or precaution to Tdap . The tip and rubber plunger of the BOOSTRIX  needleless syringe contain latex. The BOOSTRIX  single dose vial and ADACEL  preparations contain no latex. Certain Td products contain latex\n\n【81】 #3-A. Deferring Td during Pregnancy to Substitute Tdap in the Immediate Postpartum Period\nTetanus and diphtheria booster vaccination is recommended for pregnant women if >10 years have elapsed since the previous Td vaccination . To add protection against pertussis, health-care providers may defer the Td vaccination during pregnancy to substitute Tdap as soon as feasible postpartum if the woman is likely to have sufficient tetanus and diphtheria protection until delivery.\nSufficient tetanus protection is likely if:\n- a pregnant woman aged 1 Td booster dose during adolescence or as an adult (a primary series consisting of 3 doses of Td (or TT) administered during adolescence or as an adult substitutes for the childhood series of immunization), - a pregnant woman aged >31 years has received a complete childhood series of immunization (4-5 doses of pediatric DTP, DTaP, and/or DT) and >2 Td booster doses, - a primary series consisting of 3 doses of Td (or TT) was administered during adolescence or as an adult substitute for the childhood series of immunization, or - a pregnant woman has a protective level of serum tetanus antitoxin (>0.1 IU/mL by ELISA). A woman should receive Td during pregnancy if she - does not have sufficient tetanus immunity to protect against maternal and neonatal tetanus, or - requires urgent booster protection against diphtheria (e.g. for travel to an area in which diphtheria is endemic ). Alternatively, health-care providers may choose to administer Tdap instead of Td during pregnancy .\n\n【82】 #3-B. Postpartum Tdap When <2 Years Have Elapsed Since the Most Recent Td\nCertain postpartum women (e.g. those who have received Td or TT within 2 years of the immediate postpartum period) might benefit from Tdap for pertussis protection. Few subjects have been evaluated to determine the risk for adverse local and systemic reactions after Tdap at intervals <2 years  Women who have had a 3-dose series as TT instead of Td will likely have protection against tetanus but might not be protected against diphtheria.\nA protective titer of diphtheria antitoxin is >0.1 IU/mL by ELISA.\nsince the most recent Td (or other tetanus toxoid-or diphtheria toxoid-containing vaccine) . After obtaining a history to exclude women with moderate or severe adverse reactions following previous doses, health-care providers may choose to administer Tdap in postpartum women who received tetanus toxoid-or diphtheria toxoid-containing vaccine <2 years previously . Health-care providers should encourage vaccination of household and child care provider contacts of infants aged <12 months for protection against pertussis, according to current recommendations  .\n\n【83】 #3-C. History of Pertussis\nPostpartum women who have a history of pertussis should receive Tdap according to the routine recommendation . This practice is preferred because the duration of protection induced by pertussis is unknown (waning might begin as early as 5-10 years after infection) , and a diagnosis of pertussis often is not reliably confirmed. Administering pertussis vaccine to persons with a history of pertussis presents no theoretical safety concern.\n\n【84】 #3-D. Considerations for Use of Tdap in Pregnant Women in Special Situations\nACIP recommends administration of Td for booster protection against tetanus and diphtheria in pregnant women. However, health-care providers may choose to administer Tdap instead of Td during pregnancy to add protection against pertussis in special situations. In these situations, the pregnant woman should be informed of the lack of data confirming the safety and immunogenicity of Tdap in pregnant women, the unknown potential for early protection of the infant against pertussis by transplacental maternal antibodies, and the possible adverse effect of maternal antibodies on the ability of the infant to mount an adequate immune response to antigens in pediatric DTaP or conjugate vaccines containing tetanus toxoid or diphtheria toxoid.\nSpecial situations in which Tdap might be used might include instances when - a pregnant woman has insufficient tetanus or diphtheria protection until delivery, or - a pregnant woman is at increased risk for pertussis. Persons at increased risk for pertussis might include adolescents aged 11-18 years, health-care personnel, and women employed in institutions in which a pertussis outbreak is occurring or living in a community in which a pertussis outbreak is occurring.\nAdverse pregnancy outcomes are most common in the first trimester . To minimize the perception of an association of vaccine with an adverse outcome, vaccinating with tetanus toxoid-containing vaccines during the second or third trimester is preferred.\nBecause information on the use of Tdap in pregnant women is lacking, both manufacturers of Tdap have established a pregnancy registry. Health-care providers are encouraged to report vaccination of pregnant women with Tdap, regardless of trimester, to the appropriate manufacturer's registry.\n\n【85】 #3-E. Tetanus Prophylaxis for Wound Management\n\n【86】 #MMWR May 30, 20\n-r Incomplete Tetanus Vaccination. Pregnant women who have not completed the primary series might require tetanus toxoid and passive vaccination with TIG at the time of wound management . When both TIG and a tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine are indicated, each product should be administered using a separate syringe at different anatomic sites. Pregnant women with a history of Arthus reaction after a previous dose of a tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine should not receive a tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine until 10 years or more after the most recent dose, even if they have a wound that is neither clean nor minor. If the Arthus reaction was associated with a vaccine that contained diphtheria toxoid without tetanus toxoid (e.g. MCV4), deferring Td or Tdap might leave the pregnant women inadequately protected against tetanus, and TT should be administered . In all circumstances, the decision to administer TIG is based on the primary vaccination history for tetanus .\n\n【87】 #3-F. Pregnant Women with Unknown or Incomplete Tetanus Vaccination\nPregnant women who never have been vaccinated against tetanus (i.e. have received no dose of pediatric DTP, DTaP, or DT or of adult Td or TT) should receive a series of three vaccinations containing tetanus and diphtheria toxoids starting during pregnancy to ensure protection against maternal and neonatal tetanus. A primary series consists of a first dose administered as soon as feasible, a second dose at least 4 weeks later, and a third dose 6 calendar months after the second dose. If feasible, pregnant women who have received fewer than 3 doses of tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine should complete the 3-dose primary series during pregnancy. Td is preferred for the doses during pregnancy. Health-care providers may choose to substitute a single dose of Tdap for 1 dose of Td during pregnancy and complete the series with Td. In such cases, the women should be informed of the lack of data on safety, immunogenicity, and pregnancy outcomes for pregnant women who receive Tdap .\n\n【88】 #Reporting Adverse Events after Vaccination\nAs with any newly licensed vaccine, surveillance for rare adverse events associated with administration of Tdap is important for assessing its safety in large-scale use. The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 requires health-care providers to report specific adverse events that follow tetanus, diphtheria, or pertussis vaccination.\n\n【89】 #Vaccine Injury Compensation Program\nVICP is a system established by the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 that enables compensation to be paid on behalf of a person thought to have been injured or died as a result of receiving a vaccine covered by the program. Anyone receiving a covered vaccine, regardless of age, can file - For example, wounds contaminated with dirt, feces, soil, and saliva; puncture wounds; avulsions; and wounds resulting from missiles, crushing, burns, and frostbite.  Adult tetanus and diphtheria toxoids vaccine (Td) is preferred to tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap) for pregnant women who have never received Tdap. Tdap is preferred to Td for nonpregnant adults and adolescents who have never received Tdap. In special situations, use of Tdap during pregnancy might be warranted. Health-care providers who choose to administer Tdap during pregnancy should discuss with the women the lack of evidence of safety and effectiveness for the mother, fetus, pregnancy outcome, and the lack of evidence of the effectiveness of transplacental maternal antibodies to provide early pertussis protection to the infant. In addition, no study has examined the effectiveness of transplacental pertussis antibodies induced by Tdap on the adequacy of the infant immune response to pediatric DTaP and conjugate vaccines containing tetanus toxoid or diphtheria toxoid. Because adverse outcomes of pregnancy are most common in the first trimester, vaccinating pregnant women with Tdap during the second or third trimester is preferred to minimize the perception of an association of Tdap with an adverse outcome, unless vaccine is needed urgently. Td is preferred to tetanus toxoid vaccine (TT) for adults who received Tdap previously or who require tetanus protection when Tdap is not available. If TT and tetanus immune globulin (TIG) are both used, tetanus toxoid adsorbed rather than tetanus toxoid (fluid vaccine) should be administered.\na petition under VICP. The program is intended as an alternative to civil litigation under the traditional tort system because negligence need not be proven.\n\n【90】 #Areas for Future Research\nInterest in vaccinating pregnant women to prevent infant pertussis declined in the late 1940s when whole-cell vaccine trials demonstrated pertussis-specific antibodies in as many as 75% of infants vaccinated starting at birth or in the first few months of life . However, the high morbidity and mortality of certain infections that affect pregnant women and neonates warrant renewed consideration of the strategy of vaccinating pregnant women.\nEnsuring the safety of vaccination for mother and fetus and for pregnancy outcomes is a public health priority. In addition, important considerations include understanding whether a degree of protection might be achieved for the mother and for her newborn by vaccinating during pregnancy, whether maternal vaccination would be required with each pregnancy to achieve these benefits (if any), and whether change in the levels of transplacental maternal antibody might affect infant responses to routine vaccination .\nMajor gaps exist in the knowledge of how best to prevent pertussis in early infancy. These include 1 the safety of pertussis vaccines for pregnant women, their fetuses, and pregnancy outcomes; 2 the immunogenicity of acellular pertussis vaccines in pregnant women and transplacental maternal antibodies with respect to the timing of immunization during pregnancy; 3 the degree and duration of protection against pertussis in early infancy through transplacental maternal antibodies; and 4 the effects of transplacental maternal antibodies (induced by pertussis, DTP, DTaP, and/or Tdap) on the infant responses to active immunization with pediatric DTaP and conjugate vaccines containing tetanus toxoid or diphtheria toxoid . Alternative infant vaccination strategies examined independently or in conjunction with vaccinating pregnant women will determine the most effective and practical approaches to reduce the morbidity and mortality of pertussis.\nAlternatively, health-care providers may choose to administer Tdap instead of Td during pregnancy .\n\n【91】 #Postpartum Tdap When <2 Years Have Elapsed Since the Most Recent Dose of Td\nHealth-care providers should obtain a history of adverse reaction after previous doses of vaccines containing tetanus and diphtheria toxoids. Limited information is available concerning the risk for local and systemic reactions after Tdap at intervals of <2 years. Providers may choose to administer Tdap to these women postpartum for protection against pertussis after excluding a history of moderate to severe adverse reactions following previous tetanus and diphtheria-toxoidscontaining vaccines.\nHealth-care providers should encourage vaccination of household and child care provider contacts of infants aged <12 months. Women should be advised of the symptoms of pertussis and the effectiveness of early antimicrobial prophylaxis, if pertussis is suspected.\n\n【92】 #Considerations for Use of Tdap in Pregnant Women in Special Situations\nACIP recommends that Td be administered when booster protection is indicated during pregnancy. Health-care providers may choose to administer Tdap instead of Td during pregnancy to add protection against pertussis in situations when Td cannot be delayed until delivery or when the risk for pertussis is increased. In such cases, the women should be informed of the lack of data on safety, immunogenicity, and pregnancy outcomes for pregnant women who receive Tdap. Whether administration of Tdap to pregnant women results in protection of the infant against pertussis through transplacental maternal antibodies is unknown. Maternal antibodies might interfere with the infant's immune response to infant doses of DTaP or conjugate vaccines containing tetanus toxoid or diphtheria toxoid.\nIf Tdap is administered, the second or third trimester is preferred unless protection is needed urgently.\n\n【93】 #Tetanus Prophylaxis for Wound Management\nACIP recommends administration of a Td booster for wound management in pregnant women in certain situations if >5 years have elapsed since the previous Td. Health-care providers may choose to administer Tdap instead of Td during pregnancy to add protection against pertussis in these situations. In such cases, the women should be informed of the lack of data on safety, immunogenicity, and pregnancy outcomes for pregnant women who receive Tdap .\n\n【94】 #Pregnant Women with Unknown or Incomplete Vaccination\nPregnant women who have not received 3 doses of a vaccine containing tetanus and diphtheria toxoids should complete a series of three vaccinations, including 2 doses of Td during pregnancy, to ensure protection against maternal and neonatal tetanus. The preferred schedule in pregnant women is 2 doses of Td separated by 4 weeks and 1 dose of Tdap administered 6 months after the second dose (postpartum). Health-care providers may choose to substitute a single dose of Tdap for a dose of Td during pregnancy. In such cases, the women should be informed of the lack of data on safety, immunogenicity, and pregnancy outcomes for pregnant women who receive Tdap .\n\n【95】 #Reporting Adverse Events after Vaccination\nAll clinically significant adverse events should be reported to VAERS even if a causal relation to vaccination is uncertain.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": "无关文本#6#95#investigated 34,38,42,48.  other complications  ,8.类似的数字引用过多，应用全文", "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-05-08 01:37:59", "update_time": "2024-05-08 22:14:15"}

A course of therapy is defined as three intravenous doses of Indomethacin for Injection given at 12 to 24 hour intervals, with careful attention to urinary output.  If anuria or marked oliguria (urinary output <0.6 mL/kg/hr) is evident at the scheduled time of the second or third dose of Indomethacin for Injection, do not give additional doses until laboratory studies indicate that renal function has returned to normal\n- If the ductus arteriosus closes or is significantly reduced in size after an interval of 48 hours or more from completion of the first course of Indomethacin for Injection, no further doses are necessary.  If the ductus arteriosus re-opens, a second course of 1 to 3 doses may be given, each dose separated by a 12 to 24 hour interval as described above.\n- If the neonate remains unresponsive to therapy with Indomethacin for Injection after 2 courses, surgery may be necessary for closure of the ductus arteriosus.\n- Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit.\n- The reconstituted solution, pH 6.0 to 7.5, is clear, slightly yellow and essentially free from visible particles.\n- Prepare the solution with 1 to 2 mL of preservative-free Sterile Sodium Chloride Injection, 0.9 percent or preservative-free Sterile Water for Injection.  Benzyl alcohol as a preservative has been associated with toxicity in neonates.  Therefore, do not use diluents that contain preservatives.  If 1 mL of diluent is used, the concentration of indomethacin in the solution will equal approximately 0.1 mg/0.1 mL; if 2 mL of diluent are used, the concentration of the solution will equal approximately 0.05 mg/0.1 mL.  Discard any unused portion of the solution as it does not contain a preservative.  Prepare a fresh solution just prior to each administration.  Once reconstituted, the indomethacin solution may be injected intravenously.  While the optimal rate of injection has not been established, published literature suggests an infusion rate over 20 to 30 minutes.\n- Further dilution with intravenous infusion solutions is not recommended.\n- With proven or suspected infection that is untreated\n- Who are bleeding, especially those with active intracranial hemorrhage or gastrointestinal bleeding\n- With thrombocytopenia or coagulation defects\n- With significant impairment of renal function\n- With congenital heart disease in whom patency of the ductus arteriosus is necessary for satisfactory pulmonary or systemic blood flow (e.g. pulmonary atresia, severe tetralogy of Fallot, severe coarctation of the aorta).\n- Severe hepatic reactions have been reported in adults treated chronically with oral indomethacin for arthritic disorders,  If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop in the neonate, or if systemic manifestations occur, discontinue Indomethacin for Injection.\n- Indomethacin for Injection may inhibit platelet aggregation.  In one small study, platelet aggregation was grossly abnormal after indomethacin therapy (given orally to premature infants to close the ductus arteriosus).  Platelet aggregation returned to normal by the tenth day.  Observe premature infants for signs of bleeding.\n- Prematurity per se is associated with an increased incidence of spontaneous intraventricular hemorrhage.  Because indomethacin may inhibit platelet aggregation, the potential for intraventricular bleeding may be increased.  However, in the large multicenter study of Indomethacin for Injection, the incidence of intraventricular hemorrhage in neonates treated with Indomethacin for Injection was not significantly higher than in the control neonates.\n- Administer Indomethacin for Injection carefully to avoid extravascular injection or leakage as the solution may be irritating to tissue.\n- The neonates treated with Indomethacin for Injection had a significantly higher incidence of transient oliguria and elevations of serum creatinine (greater than or equal to 1.8 mg/dL) than did the neonates treated with placebo.\n- The following additional adverse reactions in neonates have been reported from the collaborative study, anecdotal case reports, from other studies using rectal, oral, or intravenous indomethacin for treatment of patent ductus arteriosus or in marketed use.  The rates are calculated from a database that contains experience of 849 indomethacin-treated neonates reported in the medical literature, regardless of the route of administration.  One year follow-up is available on 175 neonates and shows no long-term sequelae that could be attributed to indomethacin.  In controlled clinical studies, only electrolyte imbalance and renal dysfunction (of the reactions listed below) occurred statistically significantly more frequently after Indomethacin for Injection than after placebo.  Reactions marked with a single asterisk (*) occurred in 3 to 9 percent of indomethacin-treated neonates; those marked with a double asterisk  occurred in 3 to 9 percent of both indomethacin- and placebo-treated neonates.  Unmarked reactions occurred in less than 3 percent of neonates.\n- Renal failure, renal dysfunction in 41 percent of neonates, including one or more of the following: reduced urinary output; reduced urine sodium, chloride, or potassium, urine osmolality, free water clearance, or glomerular filtration rate; elevated serum creatinine or BUN; uremia.\n- Intracranial bleeding, pulmonary hypertension.\n- Gastrointestinal bleeding*, vomiting, abdominal distention, transient ileus, gastric perforation, localized perforation(s) of the small and/or large intestine, necrotizing enterocolitis.\n- Hyponatremia*, elevated serum potassium*, reduction in blood sugar, including hypoglycemia, increased weight gain (fluid retention).\n- Decreased platelet aggregation .\n- Bradycardia.\n- Apnea, exacerbation of pre-existing pulmonary infection.\n- Acidosis/alkalosis.\n- Disseminated intravascular coagulation, thrombocytopenia.\n- Retrolental fibroplasia.\n\n【2】 #=Digoxin\n- Because the half-life of digoxin (given frequently to pre-term infants with patent ductus arteriosus and associated cardiac failure) may be prolonged when given concomitantly with indomethacin, observe neonates receiving concomitant digoxin closely; frequent ECGs and serum digoxin levels may be required to prevent or detect digoxin toxicity early.\n- Indomethacin usually does not influence the hypoprothrombinemia produced by anticoagulants.  When indomethacin is added to anticoagulants, monitor prothrombin time closely.  In post-marketing experience, bleeding has been reported in patients on concomitant treatment with anticoagulants and Indomethacin for Injection.\n- Therapy with indomethacin may blunt the natriuretic effect of furosemide.  This response has been attributed to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.  In a study of 19 premature infants with patent ductus arteriosus treated with either Indomethacin for Injection alone or a combination of Indomethacin for Injection and furosemide, results showed that neonates receiving both Indomethacin for Injection and furosemide had significantly higher urinary output, higher levels of sodium and chloride excretion, and higher glomerular filtration rates than did those receiving Indomethacin for Injection alone.  In this study, therapy with furosemide helped to maintain renal function in the premature infant when Indomethacin for Injection was added.\n- The reconstituted solution, pH 6.0 to 7.5, is clear, slightly yellow and essentially free from visible particles.  The pH of the product does not meet the USP monograph .\n- Indomethacin is designated chemically as 1-(4-chlorobenzoyl)-5-methoxy-2-methyl-1H-indole-3-acetic acid.

In most systems of human pregnancy, prematurity is considered to occur when the baby is born sooner than 37 weeks after the beginning of the last menstrual period (LMP). The opposite condition, postmature birth, is defined as birth more than 42 weeks after the LMP.\nThe standard length of a human gestation is 266 days. However, for convenience most timing is based on the LMP, with conception being assumed to occur approximately 14 days after the LMP, making a standard term pregnancy 280 days or 40 weeks. Premature or preterm birth is defined medically as childbirth occurring earlier than 37 completed weeks of pregnancy. Approximately 12 percent of babies in the United States — or 1 in 8 — are born prematurely each year. In 2003, more than 490,000 babies in the U.S. were born prematurely. Worldwide rates of prematurity are more difficult to obtain as the lack of widespread professional obstetric care in developing regions makes determination of gestational age less reliable. The World Health Organization instead tracks rates of low birth weight, which occurred in 16.5 percent of births in less developed regions in 2000. It is estimated that one-third of these low birth weight deliveries are due to premature delivery.\nAlthough there are several known risk factors for prematurity , nearly half of all premature births have no known cause. When conditions permit, doctors may attempt to stop premature labor, so that the pregnancy can have a chance to continue to full term, thereby increasing the baby's chances of health and survival. However, there is currently no reliable means to stop or prevent preterm labor in all cases. In fact, the rate of preterm births in the United States has increased 30% in the past two decades.\nIn developed countries premature infants are usually cared for in a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). The physicians who specialize in the care of very sick or premature babies are known as neonatologists. In the NICU, premature babies are kept under radiant warmers or in incubators (also called isolettes), which are bassinets enclosed in plastic with climate control equipment designed to keep them warm and limit their exposure to germs. Modern neonatal intensive care involves sophisticated measurement of temperature, respiration, cardiac function, oxygenation, and brain activity. Treatments may include fluids and nutrition through intravenous catheters, oxygen supplementation, mechanical ventilation support, and medications. In developing countries where advanced equipment and even electricity may not be available or reliable, simple measures such as kangaroo care (skin to skin warming), encouraging breastfeeding, and basic infection control measures can significantly reduce preterm morbidity and mortality.\n\"Ex-premies\" is the term given to preterm infants born before the normal 37 weeks gestation.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-05-08 01:37:59", "update_time": "2024-05-08 19:44:15"}

Executive Summary\nThis report contains 16 guidelines and six procedures for implementing the CDC/ATSDR Policy on Releasing and Sharing Data 9 pertaining to CDC's re-release of State-provided data.\n\n【1】 While this document was developed for CDC data systems having specific characteristics , selected information in this document may be applicable for any CDC program that releases or shares data. However, this determination is left to the judgment of the CDC CIOs and their respective programs.\n\n【2】 #Background and Purpose\n\n【3】 Since the mid-1980s, the CDC and Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) have been engaged in extensive discussions over issues related to re-release by CDC of data released by States to CDC. States wanted assurance that CDC programs would apply consistent principles and adhere to certain standards when releasing such data.\nCDC has a responsibility to ensure that CDC programs protect the confidentiality of the State-provided data they have been entrusted with, and inform CSTE and data providers how the confidentiality of this data is being protected. In addition, CDC and CSTE have a shared responsibility to develop feasible guidelines for CDC programs that are consistent with State laws, regulations, and policies protecting confidentiality and that reflect state-of-the-art or best practices 3,4,\nThese guidelines are consistent with and expand upon the requirements listed in the CDC/ATSDR Policy for Releasing and Sharing Data 9 . A key principle of this report is the need for CDC programs to develop data agreements with State data providers before the data are received by CDC. The report also recognizes that in some CDC programs, States currently release data to CDC in the absence of explicit data agreements, and a process is necessary to develop these agreements even as data sharing continues. To facilitate this process, CDC programs will develop data re-release plans based on accepted data release practices and procedures as well as scientifically acceptable principles for confidentiality protection. Prior to finalization, draft CDC programspecific data release plans will be shared with data providers for their input. Formal agreement for each data re-release plan will be obtained from the data providers through an opt-in or opt-out \"statement of response\" from the data providers. For data providers deciding to opt-out of the data release plan, further negotiation with the data providers will be needed to customize the plan to meet State requirements. Data collected by CDC, including data collected by States and provided to CDC, becomes Federal record once received by CDC, and is subject to Federal laws and rules governing data release and Federal records retention laws. These include, but are not limited to, the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), the Privacy Act of 1974, Confidentiality Assurances and Certificates of Confidentiality . These laws, which are highlighted in Appendices B1 (Federal Laws and Rules Governing Data Release) and B2 (overview of selected Federal laws), may provide CDC with the ability to protect certain types of data from public re-disclosure; they also may require the retention and/or disclosure of data in some circumstances. Data use agreements must conform to the requirements of these laws when applicable.\n\n【4】 #What Type of Data do the CDC-ATSDR Data Release Guidelines and Procedures Apply to?\nThe CDC-ATSDR Data Release Guidelines and Procedures for Re-release of State-Provided Data contain information that may be applicable for any CDC program that releases or shares data; however, it has been prepared specifically to address the policies and practices CDC programs establish for State-provided data shared with CDC that are not already covered by a written formal data re-release procedure at the time this report is finalized. State-provided data are defined, in this report, as population-based data intended to represent a complete count of cases (or a statistical sample of all cases in a given population) that are collected by U.S. State and Territorial Health Agencies related to the health or exposure status of individual U.S. residents, which fall under State legal authority for collection and protection of privacy and confidentiality, and that are reported to CDC by State health departments. The Guidelines and Procedures also apply to unweighted microdata 10,11 (individual person records) from sample surveys administered by State Health Agencies which send CDC data containing personal identifiers or information about survey respondents that could potentially be used to identify survey respondents. Furthermore, these data release guidelines and procedures apply to State-provided surveillance and information data about events (such as a chemical spill or conflagration, etc.) only if data has been provided by the State in the format of individual person records associated with the event .\n\n【5】 #Data from Indian Tribal nations that comes to CDC indirectly through State Health\nAgencies are covered by the guidelines and procedures in this report because these data are being directly reported to CDC under the authority of the State Health Agency. For CDC public health surveillance systems which are comprised of data from State Health Agencies and other data sources, such as the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System, one data release procedure should be developed and that procedure should not be in conflict with the data release guidelines for State-provided data.\nAlthough most of the guidelines are applicable for any data that are released or shared, data not specifically covered by the CDC-ATSDR Data Release Guidelines and Procedures for Re-Release of State-Provided Data include, but are not limited to, the following:\n- individually identifiable data that are not collected under U.S. State health agency authority, such as data that CDC collects directly, and data that are reported directly to CDC by Indian Tribal nations;\n- data collected specifically for research or an outbreak investigation;\n- data systems that use public-use data compiled from another data system considered to be the primary data system.\n\n【6】 #A. Introduction\n\n【7】 Best practices statements accompany most of the guidelines On occasion, more than one best practices standard is shown because they may represent viable alternative options for specific CDC programs. The best practices statements differ from the guidelines, in that the best practices statements are not minimum standards, but rather a listing of approaches that may merit more discussion and consideration within CDC. The best practices statements are meant to be descriptive rather than prescriptive. In other words, it is being left to the discretion of each CDC program to consider for themselves whether it is appropriate to implement the listed best practices statements or implement another approach to meet the intent of the guideline.\nBecause CDC data systems vary widely with respect to their content and format, it is important that both the guidelines and best practices allow for flexibility within the context of the principles espoused by the CDC policy.\n\n【8】 There may be some aspects of the data re-release plan that may need to be deferred until the data are reviewed by the CDC program. In this situation, a short-term (and most likely brief) data re-release plan could be drafted in collaboration with the State data providers prior to the time CDC receives the data and then a more comprehensive longerterm data re-release plan developed after the CDC program has reviewed the data. The short-term plan could simply remind the State data providers about any assurances and approvals that are in place to protect the data, if any, and inform them that no data, or very limited data, will be re-released before the longer-term plan is developed . The short-term initial data agreement with State data providers should specify the expected time the initial plan will remain in place as well as the number of months the CDC program anticipates it will take to complete the longer-term more comprehensive data re-release plan in collaboration with State data providers. CDC programs will solicit the State data provider's input and formal agreement with the proposed data re-release plan by asking the data providers for a formal \"statement of response,\" which at a minimum should include the State's decision to either \"opt-in\" or \"opt-out\" of the plan or components of the plan (e.g. a State may want to include their data in a CDC program's re-release of public-use data, but not restricted-access data).\nThe CDC program may want to customize the proposed data re-release plan for State data providers wishing to opt-out of the plan because it does not offer adequate protection for their State's data. For example, if feasible, the CDC program could withhold re-release of data below a specific sub-state geographic level for some States. While States have the option to refrain from providing data to CDC if the CDC plan provides less protection than State requirements, this should be a very rare occurrence that is only used as a last resort option by the State. The CDC program will review and, if necessary, update the data release plan periodically, and will notify States whenever a change in procedure is anticipated.\nBest practices for Guideline 1: The NCHS and NAPHSIS have an agreed upon data re-release agreement for vital statistics data.\nThis process enabled CDC to customize the AIDS data re-release procedure to meet the different requirements of individual States.\n\n【9】 #Guideline 2: Suggested Content of the Data Re-Release Plan\nThe content of the data re-release plan will vary according to the needs of the CDC program and data providers.  - For CDC and State and local public health employees, permission for use of restricted-access data sets will be limited to those employees having official programmatic duties warranting access to these data.\n- For other data requestors, permission for use of restricted-access data will be based upon a review of the stated purpose of the data request (the stated purpose of the data request should be consistent with the original purpose for data collection), an assessment of whether the requested data would be appropriate to use for the intended purpose, and the need for using restricted-access data versus another type of available data set (e.g. a PUDS).\nThe CDC/ATSDR Policy on Releasing and Sharing Data states: \"CDC strives to have data release policies that are fair to all users, regardless of their organizational affiliation.\"\nCDC programs should develop a procedure describing the criteria for determining who can access non-PUDS (i.e. restricted-access) data and the party or parties within CDC who are responsible for making these decisions. Procedures for releasing restrictedaccess data include authenticating the requestor's identity  and the use of data sharing agreements (DSA) .\nBest practices for Guideline 5:\n\n【10】 Guideline 6: Include Disclaimer with Re-Release of Provisional Data 'Provisional' or 'preliminary' data are thought to be close to final but subject to change as additional records are added to the dataset or updated information is obtained. The exact definition of 'provisional' or 'preliminary' varies by data system. Because provisional data may be subject to substantial change, it may not be appropriate for these data to be used for all purposes for which finalized data are used. The CDC program will inform State data providers of their procedure for any proposed re-release of provisional public-use and restricted-access data and States, in turn, will indicate their agreement or disagreement with the re-release procedure via their \"statement of response\" . A \"Provisional Data Disclaimer\" should accompany provisional data rereleases. It should encourage the data user to consider the provisional nature of the data before using it for decisions. In addition, the disclaimer should describe how the data are reviewed to ensure accuracy, and when the data are considered finalized.\nExplicit criteria for data finalization should be documented and include adequate time for corrections from data providers and for case investigation to establish final case classification.\n\n【11】 #Guideline 7: Maintain Log of Data Sets Re-Released\nThe CDC program which re-releases State-provided data will maintain a log of data sets released.\nBest practices for Guideline 7: For PUDS data, the log of data sets released represents an inventory of the different PUDS data sets CDC has released. Ideally, such an inventory would be posted on the Internet, include a description of all State-provided PUDS public health surveillance data released by CDC, and be formatted so it can be queried by users Thus, the inventory should prompt CDC programs to perform disclosure risk assessment within the context of all previously released related data sets. Minimum data elements for the PUDS inventory could include the date the PUDS was first released, conditions or diseases included in the data set, variables and coding formats contained within the PUDS, and information on how to request the PUDS. If more than one PUDS data set is released by a single CDC program, the program should clarify how their PUDS data sets are different.\nFor restricted-access data, the primary purpose of the log of releases is to be able to track the status and terms of each data sharing agreement (DSA). This log is for internal CDC use by the CDC program responsible for tracking compliance with the terms of the DSA. Ideally, such a log would be posted on the CDC Intranet. The log of releases for restricted-access data sets should be audited to assess whether the person or persons granted access to restricted-access data are complying with the terms of their DSA. Minimum elements for the restricted-access log may include name and affiliation of the person responsible for compliance with the terms of the DSA and information on how to contact them, names of all collaborators on the project (and information on how to contact them), the list of variables and coding formats released, the name of the conditions or diseases represented by the data, and a checklist of requirements the CDC program needs to verify as per the DSA (For example, if a pre-publication review of the report was required by the DSA, the date the data user sent the report to CDC for review and the date the review was completed and comments sent to the data user; or, the date the data set was returned to CDC or destroyed, etc.).\n\n【12】 #B. Re-release of State-Provided Data as Public-Use Data\nCDC's re-release of data as a PUDS does not require the use of a DSA. When PUDS are created by CDC programs, they should be made available to all interested users, without restrictions.\n\n【13】 #Guideline 8: Planning for Release of Public-Use Data\nThis Policy indicates \"procedures for releasing publicuse data should be consistent with the CDC's Public Health Information Network's functions and specifications 15 .\" The CDC/ATSDR Policy indicates each plan for release of public-use data should include the following:\n- A procedure to ensure that confidential information is not disclosed.\n- Analysis plans and other documentation required by the Office of Management and Budget regulation on data quality\n- Instructions for non-CDC users on the appropriate use of the data.\n- The date the data will be released, which should be as soon as possible after the data are collected, scrutinized for errors and validated. The release of these data should occur no more than one year after these activities are completed.\n- The formats in which the data will be released (e.g. ASCII). For each format, give specifications (e.g. variable definitions) and information on standards for transmission.\n\n【14】 #Guideline 9: Include Disclosure Statement with PUDS\nAt the time each PUDS is released or accessed, CDC programs will include a written statement about the following responsibilities users of public-use data have:\n- A statement informing PUDS users of their responsibility to maintain confidentiality, including (per the CDC/ATSDR Policy on Releasing and Sharing Data 9 ), \"instructions that non-CDC data users must agree not to link data with other data sets… … instructions to report to the CDC ADS any inadvertent discovery of the identity of any person and to make no use of that discovery.\"\nBest practices for Guideline 9: CDC NCHS requests that PUDS users agree to:\n- \"Use the data in this dataset for statistical reporting and analysis only. Best practices for Guideline 10: Following are examples.\n- Written requests for access to State-provided data are required to be on letterhead stationery. - Oral or email requests from a known individual are considered as needing no further verification. An electronic authentication protocol can use one or more of the following methods.\n- Software access control: Password or challenge phrase; Digital certificate - Physical device: Hardware \"token\" (e.g. USB connection); Digital fob (auto-generated passnumber); SmartCard - Biometric scan The electronic process for identification-authentication can be linked to authorization \"rights\" which specify levels of access.\n\n【15】 #Guideline 11: All Requestors Wanting to Use Restricted-Access Data are Required to Sign a DSA\nThe CDC program should confirm, via the \"statement of response\"  that the State granted permission for the data to be re-released as a restricted-access data file.\nIn addition, prior to CDC's re-release of these data, all requestors must sign a DSA which governs the protection and use of these data. The CDC program which re-releases Stateprovided data will retain signed copies of the DSA. A DSA may be subsumed in a larger interagency Memorandum of Understanding (MOU).\nBest practices for Guideline 11: The 2002 modification to the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits release of a \"limited data set\" as long as a there is a written data use agreement.\n\n【16】 #Guideline 12: Monitor User Compliance with DSAs\nThe CDC program which re-releases State-provided data will monitor compliance with the terms of the DSA.\nBest practices for Guideline 12: A passive approach to compliance monitoring is acceptable, as long as the following criteria are met:\n- The data user is informed of the penalty for not complying with the terms of the DSA. (The intent of the penalty is to deter breaches in compliance.) - The data user is fully informed about their responsibilities in using the data. - The data steward institutes a process for logging compliance problems they become aware of. - The CDC program takes appropriate actions to resolve any identified problems and implements (if possible) procedures to avoid similar types of problems in the future.\nExamples of active compliance monitoring methods include:\n\n【17】 - Annual letters sent by data stewards to confirm whether the data requestor's use of the dataset has been completed and whether the data requestor has taken steps to either destroy or return the dataset.\nPre-publication or pre-presentation review can include both privacy protection as well as accuracy of scientific inferences. Releasing and Sharing Data 9 for \"special-use agreements,\" but also includes additional criteria:\n\n【18】 #C2. Development of Data Sharing Agreements for Restricted-Access Data - A description of the use to which the data will be put, and limitations on usage of data. The data requestor's description of their intended use of the data should provide evidence to the CDC program that there is a legitimate public health purpose that justifies the use of the data. The data user should also demonstrate their need for restricted-access data versus other available data, such as a PUDS.\n- Information on any laws pertaining to the DSA.\n- The names of every person who will have access to the data and specification of procedures for extending the provisions of the DSA to named collaborators (e.g. requiring signed confidentiality pledges, etc).\n- A list of mechanisms for preservation of confidentiality. These mechanisms should include both limitations on access (i.e. specified staff only) and technical security practices (such as encryption).\n- A list of restrictions on releasing analytic results.\n- A clearly stated prohibition on any attempt to link the dataset with any other dataset without prior CDC permission .\n- Provisions that govern emergency requests for identifiable or otherwise confidential data .\n- For DSAs with CDC staff acting as a data user, the following are to be included in the DSA:\nThe CDC program interested in re-releasing restricted-access data for a linked data analysis should obtain, or require the data requestor to obtain, written permission from the data providers (the States contributing the data) for the proposed linked analysis.\nPrior to seeking permission from the data providers, the data requestor should complete and sign the standard DSA  and, in addition, attach an addendum to the DSA which includes the following information, so the CDC program and data providers can determine whether to approve the data request: 1 source and description of the data file to which the restricted-access data will be linked; 2 written description of the variables and coding formats to be included in the final linked file; and 3 description of the data requestor's plan for conducting additional disclosure review to ensure that variables contributed in the linking process do not lead to re-identification of the individual described in the original data file.\nBest practices for Guideline 14: Examples of special procedures for linked analyses are:\n- \"separation of duties\", where no single individual is able to conduct all of the steps in the linkage process. - post-linkage de-identification. Standard de-identification methods should be used, such as numerator and denominator cell aggregation or suppression rules.\n\n【19】 Linkage can be conducted inside a CDC-controlled data center. This guideline applies to \"modified\" data shared outside of such centers. Data shared outside CDC-controlled data centers are partially or substantially modified, as needed, in order to minimize the likelihood of breaches of confidentiality.\n\n【20】 #Other Parties\nRestricted-access data can be released further to other parties as de-identified data, in one of two ways: 1 by creating a de-identified data set (i.e. a PUDS) from the restrictedaccess data set and then disseminating data from the PUDS, or 2 by generating deidentified data directly from the restricted-access data set (where the restricted-access data file, by definition, includes identifiable or potentially identifiable data).\nIf the requestor plans to release de-identified data generated directly from a restrictedaccess data file (situation\n\n【21】 # described above), a procedure must be implemented to ensure that the generated data have been de-identified appropriately. In this situation, the data requestor is required to submit an addendum to the standard DSA  describing the procedures that will be implemented to audit the results of the data generated for further release to other parties.\n\n【22】 #D. Confidentiality Protection\nIn addition, public health agencies are expected to have a much higher level of sophistication with regard to disclosure review than entities covered by HIPAA.\nOther useful materials on confidentiality protection have been developed and will be useful to those involved in data protection and re-release, including a book published in\n\n【23】 #B. Procedures for Implementing Confidentiality Protection\nThe following is a list of procedures for confidentiality protection. One or more of these procedures may be appropriate for a given data system. It is not the intention of this report to imply that all these methods need to be used for each data system.\n\n【24】 #Procedure 1. Limit Disclosure of Potential Identifiers\nThe CDC programs that re-release State-provided data will delete, as necessary, all information judged to be of potential use in making individuals to whom they pertain \"identifiable\" . Particular attention will be devoted to information that can lead directly to an individual or their family, such as:\n- Name - Street address - Social Security Number - Medical record number - Telephone number\n\n【25】 #Geographic Information\n- Zip code (9-, 5-, and even 3-digit)\n- Census tract\n- City/town - County\n\n【26】 #Timing of events\n- Exact date of birth (year-month-day)\n- Month and year of birth (year-month)\nInformation concerning location ,e.g.\n- Occupation (e.g. 3-or higher digit codes)\n- Education (e.g. single years)\n\n【27】 - Income (as a continuous, un-topcoded variable)\n- Medical condition/diagnosis (e.gg. 3-or higher digit ICD code)\nThere could be other program-specific variables that may be used to help disclose individual identity.\nPrior to re-release, these items must be thoroughly reviewed for their potential for personal re-identification. It is not the intent of these guidelines to imply that all of these fields must always be deleted. Under appropriate conditions and with proper safeguards, such items may be released. It is not the intent of these guidelines to recommend a single strategy for the limitation of disclosure risk. It is recognized that both programmatic and statistical considerations may come into play in deciding appropriate protections for data release. For example, an alternative to field (variable) deletion is data value recoding .\nBest\nThe HIPAA Privacy Rule de-identification standard that is consistent with this guideline requires \"a person with appropriate knowledge and experience applying generally acceptable statistical and scientific principles and methods for rendering information not individually identifiable makes and documents a determination that there is a very small risk that the information could be used by others to identify a subject of the information\" (45 CFR Part 164.514(b)(i)).\nIn addition, the limited data set may include 5-digit zip code or any other geographic subdivisions, such as State, county, city, precinct and their equivalent geocodes, except for street address. The Privacy Rule clarifies standards for the creation of deidentified data sets and \"limited data sets.\" The limited data set concept is consistent with the concept of \"restricted-access\" data that is discussed in this report.\n\n【28】 #Procedure 2. Aggregate Data Values\nThe CDC programs which re-release State-provided data, either as \"microdata\" files (e.g. data files or records on an individual person) or as tabular data, will recode fields as needed in order to aggregate data values. Common methods include:\n- collapsing continuous/interval data (e.g. age; date of occurrence) into broad categories;\n- grouping nominal data (e.g. diagnosis) into broad categories;\n- truncating variables (e.g. name).\n- top-coding or bottom-coding variables.\n\n【29】 #Procedure 3. Limit the Number of Records or the Number of Fields\nThe CDC program which re-releases State-provided data as \"microdata\" files will consider the applicability of other methods to protect microdata releases from disclosure risk. Common methods include:\n- including data from only a sample of the full dataset;\n- limiting the number of variables in the released file. For example, consider\nreleasing only those variables essential to analysis; and  limiting the number of contextual or ecological variables--information that describes a geographic area, such as where a case-patient resides--because this type of information can lead to the identification of that area.\n\n【30】 #Procedure 4. Use Numerator Rules for Data Aggregation or Suppression\nThe CDC program which re-releases State-provided data as tabular data or microdata will use numerator rules (cell size) to either\n\n【31】 There is no single numeric threshold for cell aggregation that is appropriate for all data in tabular or microdata format. Selection of an appropriate threshold level is guided by multiple factors, including:\n- sensitivity of the data (subject matter);\n- format of the data (e.g. whether the data are continuous or categorical);\n\n【32】 - likelihood that a specific record in a database may represent a unique person in a small population;\n- population or subgroup denominator size, as well as the numerator size. The CDC staff manual on confidentiality 7 generally advises a minimum numerator cell size of \"3\". Thus, numerator cell size counts of \"1\" or \"2\" are not generally advised, with some notable exceptions.\n\n【33】 The Washington State guideline states: \"If the count of cases or events in a cell is less than three, the data analyst needs to consider whether a breach of confidentiality is likely. A count of no events in the cell is clearly no threat to confidentiality, but a count of one or two events may be.\nA rule which combines numerators and denominators will meet this standard, such as a rule that data are not released if the population is less than a certain size and the number of events in a cell is less than a certain size.\n\n【34】 #Procedure 5. Use Denominator Rules for Data Aggregation or Suppression\nThe CDC programs which re-release State-provided data as tabular data or microdata will use denominator rules (population size) to either:\n\n【35】 Best practices for Procedure 5: A rule which combines numerators and denominators will meet this standard, such as a rule that addresses the relationship between the size of the numerator and the size of the denominator.\nAn approach commonly used for microdata is that data are not released if the total population from which the data are drawn is less than a certain size, based on the premise of a size sufficiently large that no subcell of the variables contained in the data would be expected to be smaller than a certain size.\nIn considering the population size in tabulated data, guidelines employed by the Washington State Department of Health state that \"Generally, tabular data based on denominators greater than 300 persons per cell present minimal risk for individual identification, Caution should be exercised by the analyst if the population size is between 100 and 300, and extreme caution is warranted when the population is less than 1\nAs indicated in Procedure 4 above, in the case of tabulated data Missouri focuses on the number of people in the population with the characteristic indicated in a given numerator. If the difference between the two is less than a minimum number, this information is not be published. On the other hand, in this scheme a very small cell number could be published if the denominator were large enough.\nWith regard to total population size, the statistical literature contains a great deal of discussion of appropriate minimal sizes and there is clearly variation depending upon information content and special considerations\nThe Federal Committee on Statistical Methodology's Confidentiality and Data Access Committee Checklist on Disclosure Potential of Proposed Data Releases 6 calls for \"a minimum of 100,000 persons in the sampled area …  provide rationale.\nGeneral Rule: All geographic areas that are identified must have a minimum of 100,000 persons in the sampled area (according to latest Census or Census estimate).\n\n【36】 #Procedure 6. Refrain From Using Techniques that Distort Data for Privacy Protection\nThe CDC programs which re-release State-provided data will refrain from distorting data (either altering data values or omitting records from the dataset) unless this approach is employed as a last resort and is absolutely necessary for the purpose of privacy protection.\nBest practices for Procedure 6: Examples of distorting data include adding statistical noise, data swapping, blanking and imputing for randomly selected records, and blurring data (replacing a reported value by an average value) Alternatively, researchers should be provided the opportunity to obtain restricted-access data under a data sharing agreement, or conduct re-analysis themselves in a CDC-controlled research data center.\nalso Practice G which mentions that a new form of disclosure limitation, entitled \"controlled tabular adjustment,\" is being researched; software is being developed to implement this new method. It was beyond the scope of this report to assess which data distortion methods minimize the magnitude of data distortion.\n\n【37】 #B. Development of a Data Set Inventory to Facilitate Disclosure Risk Assessment\nDisclosure risk assessment is performed to estimate, either qualitatively or quantitatively, the probability that a data set poses a high or low risk of re-identification in terms of the information it contains about individuals and the status of their health. Since the risk of re-identification may be increased if a one data set can be linked to an another data set, CDC data stewards should be aware of the data sets other CDC components release that could have the potential for linkage with data sets their own programs release. To help facilitate this aspect of disclosure risk assessment, CDC should compile and regularly update an inventory of data sets that have already been released and that are eligible for release in the near future. The inventory should be posted on the CDC Intranet in a browsable (or queriable) format and should include, for each data set, the name of the CDC program releasing the data set, data steward contact information, and data set documentation , including the names of diseases or conditions about which the data are tabulated , and the variables and coding formats used.\n\n【38】 #Occurred\nThis report and the CDC/ATSDR Policy on Releasing and Sharing Data states that potential confidentiality breaches should be reported to the CDC ADS. This passive approach to ascertaining potential confidentiality breaches assumes that CDC will receive such reports. CDC should consider the feasibility of taking a more active approach to identifying confidentiality breaches. If feasible to do so, CDC may wish to itself develop or contract with others to develop standard criteria for CDC programs to use in conducting active approaches.\n\n【39】 #Disclosure Risk Assessment\nThis report is not intended to be (and cannot be) a comprehensive resource on confidentiality protection or disclosure risk assessment and control. CDC programs may need to consult with experts on these issues as they develop program-specific data rerelease procedures that are consistent with guidelines and procedures in this report. CDC may wish to generally offer their programs the services of specified experts on these issues. In addition, CDC may wish to develop an interest group forum on confidentiality and data release patterned after the Confidentiality and Data Access Committee (CDAC).\n\n【40】 This report cites various materials that are currently posted on the Internet pertaining to \"training\" issues, such as data release policies, confidentiality protection, or disclosure review assessment that would be useful to preserve for use with this report. To preserve the future availability of these materials, CDC should consider creating an Intranet site where these materials are archived.\n\n【41】 The adoption of these guidelines should not deter CDC, CSTE, and others from future discussions of new methods for privacy protection and disclosure risk assessment and review. The guidelines and procedures are not \"written in stone\" and should be considered subject to change as new information and methods become available.\nBecause use of web-based interactive query systems for data dissemination is increasing, future discussions should focus on the development and use of automated suppression and auditing methodologies for use by CDC programs.\n\n【42】 Since CDC program data stewards will most likely be the primary staff responsible for writing program-specific procedures, under the direction of the CIO data-release review board or another oversight mechanism, CDC may wish to consider establishing a cross-CIO forum for data stewards to brainstorm and share suggestions for implementing the CDC-ATSDR Data Release Guidelines and Procedures for Re-Release of State-Provided Data.\nVarious issues were raised during the review of this document that the DRGWG did not address, but that merit future discussion, including the following concerns and issues that were expressed:\n- CDC may fail to inform data users of potential weaknesses or peculiarities of the data when it releases the data, while the State may have provided such information to the user.\n- CDC may re-release data containing uncorrected errors, while the State may have released the same data with corrections. More generally, data rereleased by CDC may not be exactly the same as the corresponding dataset held by the State, and the user would not be informed of this possibility.\n- CDC collects and uses data from various State agencies other than State health agencies, such as labor departments, environmental departments, and agriculture departments. These other sources of data were not included within the scope of the CDC-ATSDR Data Release Guidelines and Procedures for Re-release of State-Provided Data because of the way the Data Release Guidelines Working Group was constituted. Future discussions within CDC should focus on whether the implementation guidelines for the CDC-ATSDR Policy for Releasing and Sharing Data in this report should also apply to data from State agencies other than State health agencies.\n- State-provided data that comes to CDC from other Federal agencies and not directly from State health agencies are not considered within the scope of the\n\n【43】 #CDC-ATSDR Data Release Guidelines and Procedures for Re-release of\nState-Provided Data. Each request for this type of data may need to be handled differently, depending on the specifics of the situation, such as whether an MOU or other written agreement exists between the two Federal agencies or other statutory protections exist that define how external requests for data will be handled. In addition, for FOIA requests, an assessment may be needed to identify whether any FOIA exemptions may apply or whether the situation warrants a referral by the FOIA Officer to the Federal agency which was the source of the data being sent to CDC. Future discussions within CDC should focus on efficient processes for handling these types of data requests.\n\n【44】 #Guidelines and Procedures\nCDC and ATSDR programs having surveillance systems that fall within the scope of the CDC-ATSDR data release guidelines and procedures should examine their data re-release practices as of the effective date of the CDC-ATSDR Data Release Guidelines and Procedures for Re-release of State-Provided Data to see if they meet the minimum standards. If their procedures do not meet the minimum standards, CDC programs should have two years to revise their procedures to bring them into conformance, unless an appeal for an extension is requested from and granted by the CDC ADS. CDC CIOs should be responsible for ensuring that the guidelines and procedures are implemented either through the establishment of a CIO data-release review board , which might report to the CIO ADS and might include the CIO Information Resources Manager and relevant data stewards, or CIOs might wish to implement the policy using an alternative oversight mechanism.\nThe OPS Announcement that is distributed after the CDC-ATSDR Data Release Guidelines and Procedures for Re-release of State-Provided Data are cleared by CDC should indicate the guidelines apply to data shared between the States and CDC that are not already covered by a formal written data re-release procedure. CDC programs should examine their practices, as of the distribution date, to see if they meet the minimum standards in guidelines, and if not, to revise them to bring them into conformance with the minimum standard guidelines. CDC program data re-release procedures should be forwarded to the CDC ADS Office where an assessment of conformance with the CDC-ATSDR Data Release Guidelines and Procedures for Rerelease of State-Provided Data will be done.\n\n【45】 #Feedback to CSTE Regarding CDC's Implementation of the Guidelines\nCDC should advise CSTE on at least an annual basis during the implementation phase of these guidelines, on the status of completion of implementation. In addition, CDC should communicate with CSTE regularly regarding the results of evaluations conducted after the guidelines and procedures have been implemented by CDC programs, particularly if the results of the evaluations indicate that a revision of the guidelines is warranted.\n\n【46】 #CIO\nPrimary Representative Alternate Representative importance of the work undertaken by the DRGWG and for allowing their staff to dedicate time and resources to this effort.\n\n【47】 #Glossary\nAudit trail: The maintenance of information, in a logbook or database, pertaining the request for and release and use of individually identifiable data.\n\n【48】 #Authentication:\nThe process by which the identity of a person requesting access to individually identifiable data (restricted-access data) is verified.\n\n【49】 #Automated audit protocol:\nIn terms of disclosure risk control, the use of linear programming to identify complementary cell suppressions for a primary cell suppression and to audit the proposed cell suppression pattern to see if it provides the required level of protection. Research seems to indicate that linear programming methodologies provide good but not optimal results. For this reason, it is not enough to just perform an automated audit for secondary cell suppression.

This method differs from aggregation, in that all data values below a certain threshold are grouped; other values in the field may or may not be grouped.  top-coding.\nCell suppression: One of the most commonly used ways of protecting sensitive cells in tabular data. It is obvious that in a row with a suppressed sensitive cell, at least one additional cell must be suppressed, or the value in the sensitive cell could be calculated exactly by subtraction from the marginal total. The same is true for the column which contains a suppressed cell. For this reason, certain other cells must also be suppressed.\nThe suppression of a sensitive cell is termed a primary cell suppression. Suppression of other cells to prevent one from calculating the value in the sensitive cell is termed complementary (or secondary) cell suppression.\n\n【51】 #Computational disclosure control:\nThe process by which data values are aggregated to increase the granularity of specific variables, such as grouping age into age groups prior to data release.\n\n【52】 #Confidentiality:\nThe treatment of information that an individual or institution has disclosed in a relationship of trust, with the expectation that it will not be divulged to others in ways that are inconsistent with the understanding of the original disclosure.

The Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a) prohibits agency disclosure of any record maintained in a Federal system of records when the primary method by which the data will be retrieved is by name, social security number, or other identifying particular, such as thumb print, except pursuant to a written request, or with the prior written consent of, the individual to whom the record pertains. The creation of a Federal system of records is announced in the Federal Register. While the Privacy Act is generally protective, it contains several exceptions to the Privacy Act which permit disclosure without a subject's consent, including disclosure of the record for a routine use. A routine use is a disclosure which is compatible with the purpose for which the record was collected, and which is included in the system notice. A complete list of exceptions is found within Title 5 U.S.C. 552(a) .\n\n【59】 #Appendices\nIn addition to the Privacy Act of 1974, which contains criminal penalties for the unauthorized disclosure of protected information, the Trade Secrets Act  makes it unlawful for any officer or employee of the United States or of any Federal department or agency to publish, divulge, disclose, or make known in any manner not authorized by law any information gained through the course of Federal employment that concerns or relates to \"trade secrets, processes, operations, style of work, or apparatus, or to the identity, confidential statistical data, amount or source of any income, profits, or losses, or expenditures of any person, firm, partnership, corporation, or association…\" Information acquired through the course of official duties, through an investigation or examination, or seen in a document, is covered by the Trade Secrets Act.

The Office of Management and Budget is expected to issue definitive guidance on this issue at a later date.\n\n【61】 #Introduction\nUnder the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) (Title 5 United States Code 552 or 5 USC 552), all Federal agency records are subject to disclosure unless covered (in whole or part) by one (or more) of nine exemptions. The Privacy Act applies only to records in \"systems of records*\" , from which information is retrieved by an individual's name or other identifier. Such records are subject to release to individuals asking for their own records, to other requestors with the signed consent of the named individual, or to other requestors without a subject's consent under limited conditions specified in the Privacy Act. *Definition -The term ''system of records'' means a group of any records under the control of any Federal agency from which information is retrieved by the name of the individual or by some identifying number, symbol, or other identifying particular assigned to the individual.\n\n【62】 #Freedom of Information Act (Title 5 USC 552)\nThe Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) provides that, upon receiving a written request from any person, a Federal agency must release any requested agency record unless that record falls within one of the nine FOIA exemptions. FOIA applies to only Federal agencies, and covers only records in the possession and control of those agencies except in certain narrow instances involving grantee-held data.\n- Exemptions from FOIA (Title 5 USC 552b) 1. protects from disclosure national security information concerning national defense or foreign policy, provided that it has been properly classified pursuant to Executive Order 12,958. 2. related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency;\n(a) internal matters of a relatively trivial nature; (b) more substantial internal matters, the disclosure of which would risk circumvention of a legal requirement.\n(a) requires that the matter be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue; or (b) establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld; 4. trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person that is privileged or confidential; 5. inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than agency in litigation with the agency; 6. personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy; 7. records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that the production of such law enforcement records or information: (a) could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings; (b) would deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication;\n(c) could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of a person's privacy; (d) could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a confidential source, including a State, local or foreign agency or authority or any private institution which furnished information on a confidential basis, and, in the case of a record or information compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal investigation or by an agency conducting a lawful national security intelligence investigation, information furnished by a confidential source; (e) would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law; or (f) could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of any individual; 8. contained in or related to examination, operating, or condition reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of an agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of financial institutions; or 9. geological and geophysical information and data, including maps, concerning wells.\nAny reasonably segregable portion of a record shall be provided to any person requesting such record after deletion of the portions which are exempt under this subsection. The amount of information deleted shall be indicated on the released portion of the record, unless including that indication would harm an interest protected by the exemption in this subsection under which the deletion is made. If technically feasible, the amount of information deleted shall be indicated at the place in the record where such deletion is made.\n\n【63】 #Privacy Act (5 USC 552a)\nThe Privacy Act applies to records maintained by a Federal agency in a system of records in which the primary method for data to be retrieved is by full names, social security numbers, or other identifying particulars.\n\n【64】 #Disclosures Permitted by the Privacy Act\nThe Privacy Act permits disclosure without a subject's consent in certain circumstances:\n1. to those officers and employees of the agency which maintains the record who have a need for the record in the performance of their duties;\n\n【65】 Confidentiality protection granted by the CDC promises participants and institutions that their data will be shared only with those individuals and organizations listed in the consent form and/or the Assurance of Confidentiality Statement for the project.\nProjects that involve the collection of sensitive information frequently need confidentiality protection.

They include information on the Vi capsular polysaccharide (ViCPS) vaccine, which was not available when the previous recommendations were published\n\n【1】 #INTRODUCTION\nThe incidence of typhoid fever declined steadily in the United States from 1900 to 1960 and has since remained low. From 1975 through 1984, the average number of cases reported annually was 464. During that period, 57% of reported cases occurred among persons ≥20 years of age; 62% of reported cases occurred among persons who had traveled to other countries. From 1967 through 1976, only 33% of reported cases occurred among travelers to other countries .\n\n【2】 #TYPHOID VACCINES\nThree typhoid vaccines are currently available for use in the United States: a an oral live-attenuated vaccine (Vivotif Berna vaccine, manufactured from the Ty21a strain of Salmonella typhi  by the Swiss Serum and Vaccine Institute); b a parenteral heat-phenol-inactivated vaccine that has been widely used for many years (Typhoid Vaccine, manufactured by Wyeth-Ayerst); and c a newly licensed capsular polysaccharide vaccine for parenteral use (Typhim Vi, manufactured by Pasteur Mérieux). A fourth vaccine, an acetone-inactivated parenteral vaccine, is currently available only to the armed forces.\nAlthough no prospective, randomized trials comparing any of the three U.S.licensed typhoid vaccines have been conducted, several field trials have demonstrated the efficacy of each vaccine. In controlled field trials conducted among schoolchildren in Chile, three doses of the Ty21a vaccine in enteric-coated capsules administered on alternate days reduced laboratory-confirmed infection by 66% over a period of 5 years (95% confidence interval =50%-77%) .\nWeekly and triweekly dosing regimens have been less effective than alternate-day dosing . A liquid formulation of Ty21a is more effective than enteric-coated capsules . However, secondary transmission of vaccine organisms has not been documented.\nIn field trials involving a primary series of two doses of heat-phenol-inactivated typhoid vaccine (which is similar to the currently available parenteral inactivated vaccine), vaccine efficacy over the 2 1 ⁄ 2 -to 3-year follow-up periods ranged from 51% to 77% . Efficacy for the acetone-inactivated parenteral vaccine, available only to the armed forces, ranges from 75% to 94% .\nThe newly licensed parenteral vaccine (Vi capsular polysaccharide ) is composed of purified Vi (\"virulence\") antigen, the capsular polysaccharide elaborated by S. typhi isolated from blood cultures . In recent studies, one 25-µg injection of purified ViCPS produced seroconversion (i.e. at least a fourfold rise in antibody titers) in 93% of healthy U.S. adults ; similar results were observed in Europe . Two field trials in disease-endemic areas have demonstrated the efficacy of ViCPS in preventing typhoid fever. In a trial in Nepal, in which vaccine recipients were observed for 20 months, one dose of ViCPS among persons 5-44 years of age resulted in 74% (95% CI=49%-87%) fewer cases of typhoid fever confirmed by blood culture than occurred with controls . In a trial involving schoolchildren in South Africa who were 5-15 years of age, one dose of ViCPS resulted in 55% (95% CI=30%-71%) fewer cases of blood-culture-confirmed typhoid fever over a period of 3 years than occurred with controls. The reduction in the number of cases in years 1, 2, and 3, was 61%, 52%, and 50%, respectively . The efficacy of vaccination with ViCPS has not been studied among persons from areas without endemic disease who travel to disease-endemic regions or among children <5 years of age. ViCPS has not been tested among children <1 year of age.\n\n【3】 #VACCINE USAGE\n\n【4】 - Persons with intimate exposure (e.g. household contact) to a documented S. typhi carrier. - Microbiology laboratorians who work frequently with S. typhi .\nRoutine vaccination of sewage sanitation workers is not warranted in the United States and is indicated only for persons living in typhoid-endemic areas. Also, typhoid vaccine is not indicated for persons attending rural summer camps or living in areas in which natural disasters (e.g. floods) have occurred . No evidence has indicated that typhoid vaccine is useful in controlling common-source outbreaks.\n\n【5】 #CHOICE OF VACCINE\nThe parenteral inactivated vaccine causes substantially more adverse reactions but is no more effective than Ty21a or ViCPS. Thus, when not contraindicated, either oral Ty21a or parenteral ViCPS is preferable.\nEach of the three vaccines approved by the Food and Drug Administration has a different lower age limit for use among children . In addition, the time required for primary vaccination differs for each vaccine. Primary vaccination with ViCPS can be accomplished with a single injection, whereas 1 week is required for Ty21a, and 4 weeks are required to complete a primary series for parenteral inactivated vaccine . Finally, the live-attenuated Ty21a vaccine should not be used for immunocompromised persons or persons taking antibiotics at the time of vaccination .\n\n【6】 #VACCINE ADMINISTRATION Ty21a\nPrimary vaccination with live-attenuated Ty21a vaccine consists of one entericcoated capsule taken on alternate days for a total of four capsules. The capsules must be kept refrigerated (not frozen), and all four doses must be taken to achieve maximum efficacy . Each capsule should be taken with cool liquid no warmer than 37 C (98.6 F), approximately 1 hour before a meal. Although adverse reactions to Ty21a are uncommon among children 1-5 years of age , data are unavailable regarding efficacy for this age group. This vaccine has not been studied among children <1 year of age. The vaccine manufacturer recommends that Ty21a not be administered to children <6 years of age.\n\n【7】 #ViCPS\nPrimary vaccination with ViCPS consists of one 0.5-mL (25-µg) dose administered intramuscularly. This vaccine has not been studied among children <1 year of age. The vaccine manufacturer does not recommend the vaccine for children <2 years of age.\n\n【8】 #Parenteral Inactivated Vaccine\nPrimary vaccination with parenteral inactivated vaccine consists of two 0.5-mL subcutaneous injections, each containing approximately 5 x 10 8 killed bacteria, separated by ≥4 weeks. The vaccine manufacturer does not recommend the vaccine for use among children <6 months of age. If the two doses of parenteral inactivated vaccine cannot be separated by ≥4 weeks because of time constraints, common practice has been to administer three doses of the vaccine at weekly intervals in the volumes listed above. Vaccines administered according to this schedule may be less effective, however.\n\n【9】 #Booster Doses\nIf continued or repeated exposure to S. typhi is expected, booster doses of vaccine are required to maintain immunity after vaccination with parenteral typhoid vaccines . The ViCPS manufacturer recommends a booster dose every 2 years after the primary dose if continued or renewed exposure is expected. In a study in which efficacy was not examined, revaccination of U.S. adults at either 27 or 34 months after the primary vaccination increased mean antibody titers to the approximate levels achieved with the primary dose . The optimal booster schedule for persons administered Ty21a for primary vaccination has not been determined; however, the longest reported follow-up study of vaccine trial subjects indicated that efficacy continued for 5 years after vaccination . The manufacturer of Ty21a recommends revaccination with the entire four-dose series every 5 years if continued or renewed exposure to S. typhi is expected. This recommendation may change as more data become available about the period of protection produced by the Ty21a vaccine. If the parenteral inactivated vaccine is used initially, booster doses should be administered every 3 years if continued or renewed exposure is expected. A single booster dose of parenteral inactivated vaccine is sufficient, even if >3 years have elapsed since the prior vaccination. When the heat-phenol-inactivated vaccine is used for booster vaccination, the intradermal route causes less reaction than the subcutaneous route . The acetone-inactivated vaccine should not be administered intradermally or by jet-injector gun because of the potential for severe local reactions .\nNo information has been reported concerning the use of one vaccine as a booster after primary vaccination with a different vaccine. However, using either the series of four doses of Ty21a or one dose of ViCPS for persons previously vaccinated with parenteral vaccine is a reasonable alternative to administration of a booster dose of parenteral inactivated vaccine.\n\n【10】 #ADVERSE REACTIONS\nTy21a produces fewer adverse reactions than either ViCPS or the parenteral inactivated vaccine. During volunteer studies and field trials with oral live-attenuated Ty21a vaccine, side effects were rare and consisted of abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, fever, headache, and rash or urticaria  . In placebo-controlled trials, monitored adverse reactions occurred with equal frequency among groups receiving vaccine and placebo.\nIn several trials, ViCPS produced fever (occurring in 0%-1% of vaccinees), headache (1.5%-3% of vaccinees), and erythema or induration ≥1 cm (7% of vaccinees) .\nParenteral inactivated vaccines produce several systemic and local adverse reactions, including fever (occurring in 6.7%-24% of vaccinees), headache (9%-10% of vaccinees), and severe local pain and/or swelling (3%-35% of vaccinees) ; 21%-23% of vaccinees missed work or school because of adverse reactions . More severe reactions, including hypotension, chest pain, and shock, have been reported sporadically.\n\n【11】 #PRECAUTIONS AND CONTRAINDICATIONS\n\n【12】 No data have been reported on the use of any of the three typhoid vaccines among pregnant women. Live-attenuated Ty21a should not be used among immunocompromised persons, including those persons known to be infected with human immunodeficiency virus. The two available parenteral vaccines present theoretically safer alternatives for this group. The only contraindication to vaccination with either ViCPS or with parenteral inactivated vaccine is a history of severe local or systemic reactions following a previous dose.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-05-08 01:37:59", "update_time": "2024-05-08 18:08:59"}

Medical epidemiologists in the Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention of the National Center for HIV, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention at CDC developed this interim guidance. Subject matter experts at other federal health agencies, academic researchers, health department HIV policy stakeholders, and community representatives have participated in working groups and consultations to inform content for comprehensive U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) guidelines for PrEP use currently in development; those ideas also were used in developing this interim guidance.\n\n【2】 #Rationale and Evidence\n\n【3】 No serious toxicities were identified in any of the four trials comparing participants receiving daily oral TDF/FTC with those receiving placebo pills; however, in the first 1-2 months on medication, nausea and vomiting were more common in those receiving TDF/FTC than in those receiving placebo. The Partners PrEP trial reported 75% efficacy for TDF/ FTC (95% confidence interval  = 55%-87%) and 67% efficacy for TDF (CI = 44%-81%), with 97% medication adherence by returned pill count. In the trial, no statistically significant difference in efficacy between the two regimens was observed, and efficacy was reported for both men and women independently . The TDF2 trial found 62% efficacy (CI = 22%-83%) in men and women combined, with 84% medication adherence by returned pill count. Among persons tested who were assigned to receive TDF/FTC, the drug was detected in the blood of 81% of persons in Partners PrEP and 81% of persons in TDF2. In Partners PrEP, within a subgroup of persons who received TDF/FTC and had plasma drug levels tested, having measurable TDF concentrations was associated with a 90% risk reduction compared with placebo.\nThe findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations Second, women who became pregnant during the PrEP trials described in this report were discontinued promptly from medication, so the safety of chronic fetal exposure could not be assessed adequately. Therefore, decisions to continue PrEP during pregnancy require additional consideration. Both TDF and FTC have been used among HIV-infected pregnant women to prevent perinatal transmission, have been studied for use by discordant couples attempting conception, and have been examined in antiretroviral treatment trials that included HIV-infected women who continued therapy during their pregnancies. Data from these sources and the Antiretroviral Use in Pregnancy Registry  indicate no evidence of adverse effects among fetuses exposed to TDF or FTC . In addition, the higher risk for HIV transmission to uninfected women during pregnancy (compared with uninfected women who are not pregnant) might indicate an added value to continuing PrEP during pregnancy . Finally, sexual risk behaviors and adherence to PrEP medications among persons taking TDF/FTC for PrEP in clinical practice, when users are made aware of trial results, might be different from adherence by heterosexually active adults in PrEP trials who were unaware of their assignment to active drug or placebo and could not know the impact of adherence on efficacy.\n\n【4】 #Recommendation for Clinicians\nDaily oral TDF/FTC use in two studies has been shown to be safe in reducing the risk for sexual HIV acquisition by heterosexual women and men when consistently used. In a third study The percentage reduction in HIV incidence, compared with the placebo group, is presented for two groups: those with 50% medication adherence and those with 90% adherence.  In a substudy of participants who provided counts via home-based unannounced pill counts with supplementary adherence counseling if the counts were <80%.\nwith heterosexual women, PrEP was not found to be effective, and results are pending in a fourth study. The conflicting trial results for efficacy of TDF/FTC in heterosexual women can be partially explained by the low medication adherence in FEM-PrEP compared with the higher adherence in Partners PrEP and TDF2. As yet unidentified factors also might have influenced the results.\nUntil comprehensive PHS guidelines are available, CDC's January 2011 interim recommendations should help guide the use of PrEP in MSM . On the basis of the new data regarding PrEP use in heterosexually active adults, CDC now provides the following interim guidance for clinicians considering the use of PrEP for adults at very high risk for HIV acquisition through heterosexual sex (e.g. those with partners known to have HIV infection): 1 TDF/FTC is contraindicated for PrEP in persons with unknown or positive HIV status; 2 in women and men at very high risk for acquiring HIV from penile-vaginal sex, daily doses of TDF/FTC can be safe and effective in reducing the risk of HIV infection; 3 PrEP use may be one of several options  to help protect the HIV-negative partner in discordant couples during attempts to conceive; and 4 women of reproductive age should have a documented pregnancy test before beginning PrEP and if not pregnant at initiation, at regular intervals while being prescribed PrEP. If women are either pregnant before initiating PrEP or become pregnant while being prescribed PrEP, health-care providers should discuss currently available information regarding potential risks and benefits of continuing PrEP so that an informed decision can be made. If a woman takes PrEP while pregnant, providers are encouraged to prospectively and anonymously submit information about the pregnancy to the Antiretroviral Use in Pregnancy Registry.\nHealth-care providers should be aware, and should inform their patients that 1 the efficacy of TDF/FTC for HIV prevention is highly dependent on adherence to daily doses of medication, and 2 its long-term safety in HIV-uninfected adults or following fetal exposure is not yet determined. Health-care providers should report any serious adverse events resulting from prescribed TDF/FTC for PrEP to the FDA's MedWatch.  CDC and other PHS agencies are developing PHS guidelines on the use of PrEP as part of a comprehensive set of HIV prevention services that will include specific recommendations for use with MSM and heterosexually active adults at very high risk for HIV acquisition. The guidelines will be updated as information about factors affecting efficacy and safety for all transmission risk groups becomes available from additional studies.\n\n【5】 #Important Reminders\nPrEP has the potential to contribute to safe and effective HIV prevention for heterosexually active adults as well as MSM. CDC advises clinicians and patients to use this interim guidance as a basis to prescribe or use PrEP for heterosexually active patients until full PHS guidelines are available . When PrEP is used by heterosexually active adults, it is important to ensure that 1 PrEP is targeted to persons at very high risk for HIV acquisition , especially uninfected persons whose regular sexual partners are known to have HIV infection; 2 the importance of adherence to daily medication and its influence on efficacy is clearly discussed; 3 couples understand that although no adverse effects have been found among infants exposed to TDF/FTC during pregnancy and breastfeeding, these data are incomplete for women in HIV-discordant couples using TDF/FTC to prevent acquisition of HIV; 4 PrEP is delivered as part of a comprehensive set of prevention services, including risk-reduction, PrEP medication adherence counseling, and ready access to condoms; 5 sexually transmitted infection treatment is provided when indicated by laboratory screening tests conducted at least every 6 months, and 6 PrEP is accompanied by monitoring of HIV status, pregnancy status, side effects, adherence, and risk behaviors at each quarterly follow-up visit.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-05-08 01:37:59", "update_time": "2024-05-08 19:21:23"}

Ask the child and their parent or carer about specific learning problems, bullying at school and stress in the family.\nAsk about analgesic use in children with recurrent headache to ensure that medicine use is not excessive and to assess the likelihood of medication overuse headache\n\n【77】 ## Children with dysmorphic features and developmental delay\nRefer urgently to paediatric services children with dysmorphic features and developmental delay.\n\n【78】 ## Children aged under 4 years\nFor all children aged under 4 years with suspected abnormal head shape or size:\ntake 3 consecutive measurements of the child's head circumference at the same appointment, using a disposable paper tape measure plot the longest of the 3 measurements on a standardised growth chart, corrected for gestational age if the child's head circumference is below the 2nd centile, refer for paediatric assessment.Offer follow-up measurements if needed, according to clinical judgement and taking the child's age into account.\nFor children with a head circumference measurement that differs by 2 or more centile lines from a previous measurement on a standardised growth chart (for example, an increase from the 25th to the 75th centile, or a decrease from the 50th to the 9th centile):\n\n【79】 vomiting unsteadiness (ataxia)\nheadache.\nnote the head size of the biological parents, if possible, to check for familial macrocephaly if familial macrocephaly is likely, do not routinely refer the child in the absence of any other problem.\n\n【80】 ## Babies aged under 1 year with plagiocephaly\nFor babies aged under 1 year whose head is flattened on one side (plagiocephaly):\nbe aware that positional plagiocephaly (plagiocephaly caused by pressure outside the skull before or after birth) is the most common cause of asymmetric head shape measure the distance between the outer canthus of the baby's eye and the tragus of their ear on each side if the measurements differ, confirm positional plagiocephaly and do not routinely refer if the baby is developing normally\nAdvise parents or carers of babies with positional plagiocephaly that it is usually caused by the baby sleeping in one position and can be improved by changing the baby's position when they are lying, encouraging the baby to sit up when awake, and giving the baby time on their tummy.\n\n【81】 #Hypotonia ('floppiness')\nFor babies aged under 1 year with acute-onset hypotonia (floppiness), examine the baby for signs of cardiac failure, enlargement of the liver or kidneys, pyrexia or an altered level of consciousness, and refer immediately to paediatric services.\nFor babies aged under 1 year with hypotonia (floppiness) that has been present for weeks or months:\nif the baby is weak (for example, with feeding and breathing difficulties), refer urgently to paediatric services or if the baby is not weak and has no signs of intercurrent illness, consider referring in line with the recommendations on looking for signs of cerebral palsy in the NICE guideline on cerebral palsy under 25s.\n\n【82】 ##

Motor development delay\nRefer children to a child development service, and consider referring for physiotherapy or occupational therapy, in line with the recommendations in the NICE guideline on cerebral palsy in under 25s, if they:\nare not sitting unsupported by 8 months (corrected for gestational age) or show early asymmetry of hand function (hand preference) before 1 year (corrected for gestational age).\nIf the child is a boy, consider measuring creatinine kinase level to exclude Duchenne muscular dystrophy before the boy has had a specialist review.\n\n【87】 ## Motor development regression\nRefer children with motor development regression to a paediatric neurodevelopmental service or paediatric neurology depending on locally agreed pathways.\nIf the child is a boy, consider measuring creatinine kinase level to exclude Duchenne muscular dystrophy before the boy has had a specialist review.\n\n【88】 ## Children with a recent head or neck trauma\n\n【89】 ## Children with no recent trauma\nIn children with abnormal neck posture, check whether painful cervical lymphadenopathy is the cause.\nRefer children who develop abnormal limb posture that has no apparent musculoskeletal cause for neurological assessment.\nBe aware that abnormal head tilt in children can be a symptom of posterior fossa tumour.\n\n【90】 ## Tingling together with other symptoms\nRefer urgently children who have tingling accompanied by other peripheral nervous system symptoms such as weakness, bladder dysfunction or bowel dysfunction for neurological assessment.\nBe aware that tingling in children may be the first symptom of an acute polyneuropathy (Guillain–Barré syndrome) or other neuro-inflammatory conditions. If the child has features suggesting motor impairment, refer urgently for neurological assessment.\n\n【91】 ## Isolated tingling, altered sensation or paraesthesia\nRefer children with isolated tingling, altered sensation or paraesthesia for neurological assessment if the symptoms are episodic and are not associated with compression of a nerve\n\n【92】 ## Temporary tingling caused by nerve compression or hyperventilation\nDo not routinely refer children for neurological assessment of temporary tingling or numbness if there is a clear history of the symptom being triggered by activities known to cause nerve compression, such as carrying a heavy backpack or sitting with crossed legs.\nBe aware that in children, hyperventilation is a common cause of transient tingling in the limbs.\n\n【93】 ## Symptoms suggesting possible respiratory failure\nRefer urgently children with neuromuscular disorders who have early-morning headaches or new-onset sleep disturbance for a respiratory assessment.\n\n【94】 ## Sleep disorders suggesting nocturnal seizures\nRefer urgently children who have symptoms suggestive of new-onset epileptic seizures in sleep for neurological assessment.\n\n【95】 ## Narcolepsy\nRefer children with symptoms suggestive of narcolepsy, with or without cataplexy, for neurological assessment or a sleep clinic assessment according to local pathways.\n\n【96】 ## Sleep disorders suggesting sleep apnoea\nRefer children with symptoms of sleep apnoea to ear, nose and throat or paediatric respiratory services, as appropriate, and offer advice on weight loss if the child is obese.\n\n【97】 ## Night terrors in children aged over 5 years\nRefer children aged over 5 years with new-onset night terrors and children with night terrors that persist after age\n\n【98】 ## Night terrors and other sleep disturbances in children aged under 5 years\nReassure parents or carers of children aged under 5 years who have night terrors, repetitive movements, sleep talking or sleep walking that these are common in healthy children and rarely indicate a neurological condition.\nOffer advice on sleep hygiene to parents or carers of children with insomnia, and consider referring to a health visitor if the child is aged under 5 years.\n\n【99】 ## Sleep disorders in children with neurodevelopmental disorders or learning disabilities\nConsider referring children with sleep disorders associated with neurodevelopmental disorders or learning disabilities to community paediatric services.\n\n【100】 ## Sleep disorders as a result of gastro-oesophageal reflux or constipation\nBe aware that sleep disorders in children may be a symptom of gastro-oesophageal reflux or constipation.  the recommendations on diagnosing and investigating gastro-oesophageal reflux disease in the NICE guideline on gastro-oesophageal reflux disease in children and young people, and the NICE guideline on constipation in children and young people.\n\n【101】 ## New-onset slurred or disrupted speech\nRefer urgently children with new-onset slurred or disrupted speech that is not attributable to prescribed medicines, recreational drugs or alcohol for neurological assessment.\n\n【102】 ## Problems with speech development in children aged over 2 years\nConsider referring children aged over 2 years with abnormal speech development to speech and language services.\nBe aware that delay or regression in speech and language in children can be a symptom of autism. Follow the recommendations in the NICE guideline on recognition, referral and diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder in under 19s for recognising children and young people with possible autism and referring children and young people to the autism team.\n\n【103】 ## New-onset squint with loss of red reflex\nRefer immediately children with new-onset squint that occurs together with loss of red reflex in one or both eyes to ophthalmology services. recommendations on childhood cancers in NICE's guideline on suspected cancer.\n\n【104】 ## New-onset squint with ataxia, vomiting or headache\nRefer immediately children with new-onset squint that occurs together with ataxia, vomiting or headache to acute paediatric services.\n\n【105】 ## Paralytic squint\nRefer urgently children with paralytic squint for neurological assessment, even in the absence of other signs and symptoms of raised intracranial pressure.\n\n【106】 ## Non-paralytic squint\nRefer children with non-paralytic squint to ophthalmology services.\n\n【107】 ## Sudden-onset involuntary movements\nRefer immediately children who have sudden-onset chorea, ataxia or dystonia for neurological assessment.\n\n【108】 ## Tics\nDo not routinely refer children with simple motor tics that are not troublesome to the child.\nAdvise parents or carers of children with a tic disorder to discuss the disorder with the child's school, emphasising that the tic is an involuntary movement and the child should not be reprimanded for it.\nBe aware that tics and stereotypies (repetitive or ritualistic movements such as body rocking) are more common in children with autism or a learning (intellectual) disability.\nFor children with a tic disorder that has a significant impact on their quality of life, consider referring according to local pathways, as follows:\nreferral to mental health services if the tic disorder is associated with symptoms of anxiety or obsessive compulsive behaviour\n\n【109】 ## Tremor of sudden onset or with accompanying neurological signs or symptoms\nRefer urgently children presenting with tremor for neurological assessment if:\nthey have additional neurological signs or symptoms such as unsteadiness or the onset of the tremor was sudden.\n\n【110】 ## Postural tremor\nBe aware that isolated postural tremor in children may be a side effect of sodium valproate or a beta-adrenergic agonist.\nConsider thyroid function tests for children with postural tremor and other symptoms or signs suggestive of thyroid overactivity.\nRefer children with postural tremor for occupational therapy only if the tremor is affecting activities of daily living such as writing, eating or dressing.\n\n【111】 #Refer immediately\nTo be seen by the specialist service within a few hours, or even more quickly if necessary.\n\n【112】 #Refer urgently\nTo be seen by the specialist service within 2 weeks.\n\n【113】 #Refer\nA routine referral.\n\n【114】 #Consider referring\nConsider a routine referral.\n\n【115】 #Dizziness\nA subjective sensation of spinning (vertigo) or a more vague sensation of unsteadiness, and sometimes a feeling of light-headedness or pre-syncope.\n\n【116】 #Functional neurological disorder\nA condition in which people experience neurological symptoms in the absence of any identifiable causative physical or structural abnormality.\n\n【117】 #Radiculopathy\nIrritation or damage to a nerve root as it exits the spinal canal. It is most commonly caused by mechanical compression from a prolapsed intervertebral disc or degenerative arthritis of the spine. Less frequently, an infection such as herpes zoster or Lyme disease is the cause. Symptoms include neck or low back pain radiating into a limb, tingling (paraesthesia), reduced or absent deep tendon reflex(es) and weakness in the distribution of the nerve root\n\n【118】 #Rationale: recommendations for adults aged over\n\n【119】 #Blackouts in adults\n\n【120】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThe committee agreed that the NICE guideline on transient loss of consciousness ('blackouts') in over 16s provides comprehensive recommendations on recognition and referral.\n\n【121】 #Dizziness and vertigo in adults\n\n【122】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThe committee used their knowledge and experience, together with evidence, to develop the recommendations on dizziness and vertigo in adults.\nEvidence showed that sudden-onset dizziness is more likely to indicate a serious neurological condition if it is accompanied by imbalance and a focal abnormality. The committee confirmed that this is in line with their own clinical experience. They noted that these symptoms can also be caused by hypoglycaemia, and that prompt treatment of hypoglycaemia can reduce neurological damage.\nThe committee acknowledged the difficulty in differentiating between benign peripheral vertigo and the potentially more serious central vertigo that indicates a possible posterior circulation stroke. They agreed that a rapid bedside test would be a valuable addition to practice and could reduce unnecessary scans.\nThere is evidence showing that the accuracy of the bedside HINTS (head-impulse–nystagmus–test-of-skew) test is broadly similar to that of MRI in identifying people who have had a stroke and ruling out stroke in those who haven't. However, this accuracy is achieved only if the test is carried out by someone who has training and expertise in its use and interpretation. The committee noted that the HINTS test is non-invasive and would avoid the need for scans in people with a negative HINTS examination. To ensure that all people with stroke are identified promptly, the committee agreed that an immediate referral should be made if there is no healthcare professional with training in the HINTS test available.\nIn the committee's experience, symptoms caused by a functional neurological disorder can mimic symptoms caused by a physical neurological disorder. Dizziness is a common example of such a symptom. The committee thought it important to make a recommendation highlighting this to enable non-specialists to recognise when recurrent dizziness can be managed as part of a functional neurological disorder, rather than a symptom needing referral for neurological investigation.\n\n【123】 #Facial pain, atraumatic\n\n【124】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nAlthough atraumatic facial pain is a common symptom, no evidence on associated features that might indicate a need for referral was identified. The committee used their knowledge and experience to highlight signs and symptoms that might indicate a need for referral.\nThe committee agreed that facial pain together with persistent numbness or abnormal neurological signs should be referred urgently for neuroimaging to exclude a possible infiltrative or intracranial mass lesion.\n\n【125】 #Gait unsteadiness\n\n【126】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThe committee used their knowledge and experience, together with validation by external experts, to develop the recommendations on gait unsteadiness.\nThe committee noted that this is an unusual symptom that could indicate a number of underlying conditions, including a brain tumour, an infection or a paraneoplastic presentation of an ovarian, lung or breast cancer. Because of the seriousness of these conditions, the committee agreed that people with this symptom should be referred urgently for specialist investigation.\n\n【127】 #Handwriting difficulties\n\n【128】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThe committee used their knowledge and experience, together with validation by external experts, to develop the recommendations on handwriting difficulties.\nAlthough the committee thought that isolated handwriting difficulty is an unusual stroke presentation, they agreed that it is important to consider the possibility of stroke if handwriting difficulty occurs very suddenly.\n\n【129】 #Limb or facial weakness in adults\n\n【130】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThe committee used their knowledge and experience, together with validation by external experts, to develop the recommendations on limb or facial weakness in adults.\nIn the committee's experience, sudden-onset weakness that is restricted to a single limb is sometimes incorrectly attributed to a compression neuropathy or a musculoskeletal cause. They agreed that stroke or transient ischaemic attack should be suspected in all cases of sudden-onset limb or facial weakness.\nThe committee agreed that rapidly progressive symmetrical limb weakness can indicate a potentially life-threatening neuromuscular disorder or cervical myelopathy. These disorders can affect the respiratory muscles and cause respiratory failure. Their presenting features can be difficult to recognise in the early stages of the disorder.\nThe committee agreed that these symptoms can indicate cauda equina syndrome, which is a medical emergency.\n\n【131】 #Memory failure and cognitive deterioration\n\n【132】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThe committee used their knowledge and experience, together with validation by external experts, to develop the recommendations on memory failure and cognitive deterioration. They reviewed evidence on specific tools for brief memory testing but no evidence to support a recommendation on specific tools was identified.\nThe committee agreed that the NICE guideline on dementia provides advice on referring adults with progressive memory problems.\n\n【133】 #Posture distortion in adults\n\n【134】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThe committee used their knowledge and experience, together with validation by external experts, to develop the recommendations on posture distortion in adults.\nThe committee wanted non-specialists to be aware that cervical dystonia is diagnosed on the basis of clinical features, and that imaging is unnecessary and can delay treatment. They also wanted to raise awareness of the wide range of ways in which dystonia can present, such as only during the performance of certain tasks or in certain parts of the body.\n\n【135】 #Sensory symptoms including tingling or numbness in adults\n\n【136】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThe committee used their knowledge and experience to develop the recommendations on sensory symptoms including tingling or numbness in adults. Although evidence was reviewed, none that could support recommendations was identified.\nAlthough the committee agreed that recurrent, brief, fixed-pattern sensory disturbances are not the most common presentation of epilepsy, they thought referral would be important so as not to miss this important diagnosis.\nThe committee also wanted to encourage non-specialists to explore the possibility of peripheral neuropathy as a cause of sensory symptoms before referral. They thought this would help to ensure that people with these symptoms are referred to the correct service, which may be neurological or non-neurological.\nThe committee agreed that this is a common condition that usually improves with time, and might benefit from weight loss.\nIn the committee's experience, cervical and lumbar radiculopathies usually settle spontaneously within a few weeks. However, the committee thought it important to highlight features that might suggest a more serious underlying condition and need further investigation.\n\n【137】 #Sleep disorders in adults\n\n【138】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThe committee used their knowledge and experience, together with validation by external experts, to develop the recommendations on sleep disorders in adults.\nThe committee thought it important that people with excessive sleepiness are offered assessment for sleep apnoea so that they can be referred in line with local policies and pathways for the management of this condition. They agreed that the Epworth score is a well-established measure of sleep apnoea suitable for use by non-specialists.\nAlthough narcolepsy and cataplexy are rare conditions, the committee thought it important to highlight them to raise awareness among non-specialists.\n\n【139】 #Smell or taste problems\n\n【140】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThe committee used their knowledge and experience, together with validation by external experts, to develop the recommendations on smell or taste problems.\nIn the committee's experience, sudden-onset distortion of sense of smell or taste is usually idiopathic. The committee wanted to reassure non-specialists that this symptom is unlikely to indicate a neurological condition.\nThe committee noted that loss of sense of smell or taste is a fairly common reason for referral to neurological services, but rarely has a serious neurological cause. They therefore thought that neuroimaging is not usually needed.\n\n【141】 #Speech, swallowing and language problems in adults\n\n【142】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThe committee used their knowledge and experience, together with validation by external experts, to develop the recommendations on speech, swallowing and language problems in adults.\nThe committee agreed that sudden-onset speech or language disturbance could indicate a vascular event.\nThe committee noted that slurred or disrupted speech can indicate serious underlying neurological disease, such as motor neurone disease or myasthenia gravis. Although the prognosis in motor neurone disease is not greatly influenced by early diagnosis, it is important to consider other diagnoses such as myasthenia gravis, which is highly treatable.\nThe committee also wanted to raise awareness of dysphonia as a possible presenting symptom of Parkinson's disease.\n\n【143】 #Tics and involuntary movements in adults\n\n【144】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThe committee used their knowledge and experience, together with validation by external experts, to develop the recommendations on tics and involuntary movements in adults.\nThe committee agreed that tics are relatively common and, on their own, are benign. Treatment and management options are limited so there is little value in referring to secondary care. The committee noted that tic disorders are often accompanied by anxiety and distress that might be relieved by psychological therapy. If this is not effective and the tics are very severe or socially disabling, the committee thought that neurological referral to explore further treatment options might be beneficial.\nSmall, involuntary muscle twitches are usually benign, and are especially common in the calf muscles. If accompanied by weakness, muscle wasting or muscular rigidity (stiffness), they could indicate neuromuscular disease. Otherwise, the committee considered that it is usually sufficient to reassure the person.\n\n【145】 #Tremor in adults\n\n【146】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThe committee used their knowledge and experience to develop the recommendations on tremor in adults. Although evidence was reviewed, none that could support recommendations was identified.\n\n【147】 #Information and support\n\n【148】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThe committee used their knowledge and experience to develop the recommendations on information and support. They agreed that this guideline covers a very broad population, and that it is unwise to give guidance on people's specific information and support needs before a diagnosis has been made. They therefore included information that might usefully be given to people presenting with neurological symptoms in the relevant recommendations, and highlighted the NICE guideline on patient experience in adult NHS services.\n\n【149】 #Attention, concentration and memory problems\n\n【150】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThe committee used their knowledge and experience, together with validation by external experts, to develop the recommendations on attention, concentration and memory problems.\nIn children already diagnosed with epilepsy, the committee discussed drowsiness caused by anti-epileptic medicines, especially in higher doses or if more than one medicine is being taken. Children and their parents or carers can be advised about this, and it might be possible to adjust doses to reduce the effect on concentration and memory.\nThe committee discussed the common perception of children with attention and concentration problems as having hyperactive, noisy and destructive behaviour. Such children readily come to the attention of primary care, school and paediatric neurodevelopmental services. The committee wanted to ensure that children who do not have hyperactivity but do have significant attention and concentration problems are also recognised. Because they do not behave in a disruptive manner, these children may not be identified promptly, and may later present with learning difficulties.\n\n【151】 #Blackouts and other paroxysmal events\n\n【152】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThe committee used their knowledge and experience to develop the recommendations on blackouts and other paroxysmal events. Although evidence was reviewed, none that could support recommendations was identified.\nBlackouts in children can be caused by neurological disorders, predominantly epilepsy, cardiac disorders or simple syncope. The committee observed that, even with a clear first-hand description of the event, it is not always possible to make a confident diagnosis without specialist assessment and investigations. The committee agreed that the recommendation for people with suspected epilepsy in the NICE guideline on transient loss of consciousness ('blackouts') in over 16s is applicable to children aged under\nVacant spells – often called absences – as a result of epilepsy in children can be difficult to distinguish from day-dreaming and loss of concentration, and need further assessment.\nVasovagal syncope is common in young people, and is often inappropriately referred because of concern that it represents seizures. The committee considered that the recommendation on vasovagal syncope in the NICE guideline on transient loss of consciousness ('blackouts') in over 16s is applicable to children aged 12 to 15 years.\nTransient loss of consciousness after a head injury in children is usually immediate or within a few minutes. Much-delayed paroxysmal events after head injury in children – days or weeks later – are rare but warrant urgent referral for neurological assessment. The committee considered that the recommendations on pre-hospital assessment, advice and referral to hospital in the NICE guideline on head injury should be followed.\n\n【153】 #Confusion, acute\n\n【154】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThe committee used their knowledge and experience, together with validation by external experts, to develop the recommendations on acute confusion.\nAcute confusion in a child can be a symptom of a severe neurological illness such as meningitis, intracranial haemorrhage, raised intracranial pressure, or drug or alcohol poisoning. The committee agreed that all children presenting with acute confusion should be transferred to hospital immediately by the quickest means available. Hypoglycaemia can present with acute confusion and therefore blood glucose should be measured as soon as possible to avoid delays in diagnosis and treatment for the child once in hospital care. This will also save time for paramedic services.\n\n【155】 #Dizziness and vertigo in children\n\n【156】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThe committee used their knowledge and experience, together with validation by external experts, to develop the recommendations on dizziness and vertigo in children.\nThe committee thought that non-specialists should bear in mind the possibility of postural hypotension, which is common in children aged over 8 years. They noted that postural hypotension might not be present at the time of examination and cannot always be excluded by measuring blood pressure.\n\n【157】 #Headaches in children\n\n【158】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThe committee used their knowledge and experience to develop the recommendations on headaches in children. Although evidence was reviewed, none that could support recommendations was identified.\nThe committee agreed that headache in a child aged under 4 years is an unusual symptom and, when present, has a high chance of being associated with a significant intracranial disease. Because the child is unable to articulate clearly what is wrong, parents may report excessive crying, a high-pitched cry or excessive irritability.\nHeadaches that are relieved by lying down might indicate spontaneous intracranial hypotension. Although this condition is rare, the committee agreed that children with this symptom would benefit from referral and treatment.\n\n【159】 #Head shape or size abnormalities\n\n【160】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThe committee used their knowledge and experience to develop the recommendations on head shape or size abnormalities. Although evidence was reviewed, none that could support recommendations was identified.\nThe committee discussed a number of rare syndromes that involve premature closure of cranial sutures in association with other dysmorphic features, including disorders of facial growth and limb deformities. The investigation and management of these disorders is highly specialised and complex. The committee recommended urgent referral because early surgical intervention can be beneficial for these children.\nBabies frequently have a preferred lying position with their head to one side. This can lead to positional plagiocephaly, a benign condition in which one side of the head is flattened. The committee discussed how measuring the distance between the tragus of the ear and the outer canthus of the eye is a useful adjunct to clinical inspection and can help to reassure parents or carers. However, the committee acknowledged that this is not an absolute discriminator. Clinical assessment is always subjective and there is no test, short of imaging (rarely justified in plagiocephaly), that is infallible. Therefore, if there is uncertainty, referral for specialist assessment is advisable.\n\n【161】 #Hypotonia ('floppiness')\n\n【162】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThe committee used their knowledge and experience, together with validation by external experts, to develop the recommendations on hypotonia ('floppiness').\n\n【163】 #Limb or facial weakness in children\n\n【164】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThe committee used their knowledge and experience, together with validation by external experts, to develop the recommendations on limb or facial weakness in children.\nIn the committee's view, sudden or rapidly progressive limb or facial weakness in a child is usually a symptom of a pathology that needs immediate neurological investigation or management because the child's condition can deteriorate rapidly.\nThe committee noted that cerebral palsy is the most common chronic motor disorder that affects children, but other genetic and medical disorders can have a similar presentation. They agreed that the recommendations in the NICE guideline on cerebral palsy in under 25s should be followed.\nthe rationale on early diagnosis of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.\n\n【165】 #Motor development delay and unsteadiness\n\n【166】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThe committee used their knowledge and experience, together with validation by external experts, to develop the recommendations on motor development delay and unsteadiness. Although evidence on creatine kinase testing for Duchenne muscular dystrophy was reviewed, none that could support recommendations was identified.\nThe committee agreed that new-onset gait abnormality could indicate trauma, infection, appendicitis or a hip abnormality, so these children need to be referred immediately.\nAlthough most children with motor development delay are simply at the slower end of the normal range of acquisition of motor skills, a small number will have a neurodevelopmental disorder such as muscular dystrophy or cerebral palsy. Assessment is relatively quick and the committee's view was that it is worth referring these children to a child development service to screen for problems and, in most cases, reassure parents. The committee agreed that the NICE guideline on cerebral palsy in under 25s provides further advice on referral for these children.\nEarly diagnosis of Duchenne muscular dystrophy is especially important so that the family can be offered genetic counselling. Creatinine kinase measurement is an inexpensive, routine test that can help identify this condition. If the test result is negative, Duchenne muscular dystrophy is unlikely.\n\n【167】 #Posture distortion in children\n\n【168】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThe committee used their knowledge and experience, together with validation by external experts, to develop the recommendations on posture distortion in children.\nAbnormal neck posture in a child who has had a recent head or neck trauma can indicate instability of cervical spine through bony or ligamentous injury, so the committee agreed that the child should be referred to an emergency department immediately, and immobilisation applied in line with the recommendations in the NICE guidelines on head injury and spinal injury.\nThe committee agreed that the most common cause of abnormal limb posture in children is pain or injury. If there is no history of an associated acute event or obvious musculoskeletal cause, the child needs to be referred to exclude progressive causes that need treatment.\n\n【169】 #Sensory symptoms such as tingling or numbness in children\n\n【170】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThe committee used their knowledge and experience to develop the recommendations on sensory symptoms including tingling or numbness in children. Although evidence was reviewed, none that could support recommendations was identified.\nTingling together with other peripheral nervous system symptoms might indicate pathology affecting the spinal cord. It is not easy to recognise this pathology on clinical examination, so the committee agreed that children with these symptoms need to be referred urgently.\n\n【171】 #Sleep disorders in children\n\n【172】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThe committee used their knowledge and experience, together with validation by external experts, to develop the recommendations on sleep disorders in children.\nThe committee noted that in children with neuromuscular disorders such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy, headaches on awakening in the morning can be an early sign of respiratory failure caused by hypoventilation during sleep. These children are also more susceptible to sleep apnoea and other breathing disorders caused by decreased muscle tone in the muscles of the airway.\n\n【173】 #Speech problems in children\n\n【174】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThe committee used their knowledge and experience, together with validation by external experts, to develop the recommendations on speech problems in children.\nThe committee noted that problems with speech development are a very common presentation. They discussed the appropriate age for referral, noting that there is a wide range within which development can be considered normal. They therefore agreed that referrals should not be made before the age of 2 years. Until that age, development may be within normal limits, and speech difficulties may resolve unaided.\n\n【175】 #Squint\n\n【176】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThe committee used their knowledge and experience, together with validation by external experts, to develop the recommendations on squint.\nThe committee agreed that referral should be immediate as new-onset squint with loss of red reflex in one or both eyes can indicate a retinoblastoma, or other progressive pathology of the eye.  Additionally, following post publication feedback, NICE felt it was important to highlight that a new-onset squint with loss of red reflex in one or both eyes may also indicate a neurological condition associated with raised intracranial pressure or a brain tumour.\nNew-onset squint presenting with accompanying symptoms such as ataxia, vomiting or headache can indicate raised intracranial pressure. The committee agreed that children presenting with squint and any of these symptoms should be referred immediately.\nIntracerebral tumour or inflammation can present with restriction of movement of one or both eyes, so the committee agreed that this symptom should trigger urgent referral.\nIn a non-paralytic squint, the child retains the ability to move both eyes fully in all directions. In the absence of any other signs or symptoms such as loss of red reflexes, ataxia, vomiting or headaches, the committee agreed that this symptom warrants a routine referral to ophthalmology.\n\n【177】 #Tics and involuntary movements in children\n\n【178】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThe committee used their knowledge and experience, together with validation by external experts, to develop the recommendations on tics and involuntary movements in children.\nThe committee agreed that sudden onset of chorea, ataxia or dystonia in a child can be a symptom of a progressive neurological disease such as a space-occupying lesion, a metabolic disturbance, a degenerative condition, a para-infectious condition such as rheumatic fever, or drug-induced, so all children with this symptom should be referred immediately.\n\n【179】 #Tremor in children\n\n【180】 ## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThe committee used their knowledge and experience, together with validation by external experts, to develop the recommendations on tremor in children.\nThe committee agreed that children with these symptoms or signs need to be referred for assessment because tremor can be the initial symptom of a space-occupying lesion in children if its onset is sudden or it is accompanied by other neurological signs or symptoms.\nBecause tremor is rarely caused by a progressive neurological condition, the committee thought that effective management of the tremor should be the priority. They noted that occupational therapists have the skills to assess how the tremor affects the child's home and school life.\n\n【181】 Around 10% of visits to GPs and hospital emergency departments are made by people with symptoms or signs associated with neurological conditions. Many of these people will need referral to a specialist for diagnosis and treatment, but others can have their condition managed in primary care.\nCurrently there is a lack of support to help non-specialists identify when a referral for specialist investigation of neurological symptoms or signs should be made. This has led to delays in referral for people with treatable or potentially serious neurological conditions, and unnecessary referrals for others. Although many specialist professional and charitable bodies have produced guidance on specific neurological conditions, there is a need for overarching guidance that covers a wide range of neurological symptoms and signs.\nThis guideline provides recommendations on clinical assessment in non-specialist settings and indications for referral to specialist care (including referral for people with existing neurological conditions). The guideline focuses on the signs and symptoms that are most frequently under- or over-referred, or cause uncertainty among non-specialists. In some recommendations, additional educational information is provided to help guide non-specialists. If a sign or symptom is covered by other NICE guidance, a cross-referral to that guidance is included.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-05-08 01:37:59", "update_time": "2024-05-08 20:04:00"}

Tonometry is the method eye care professionals use to determine this. IOP is an important aspect in the evaluation of patients at risk from glaucoma. Most tonometers are calibrated to measure pressure in millimeters of mercury (mmHg).\n\n【2】 #Physiology\nIntraocular pressure is mainly determined by the coupling of the production of aqueous humor and the drainage of aqueous humor mainly through the trabecular meshwork located in the anterior chamber angle.\nAn important quantitative relationship is provided below:\nWhere F = aqueous fluid formation rate, C = outflow rate, PV = episcleral venous pressure.\nThe above factors are those that drive IOP.\n\n【3】 #Measurement\nIntraocular pressure is measured with a tonometer as part of a comprehensive eye examination.\nMeasured values of intraocular pressure are influenced by corneal thickness and rigidity. As a result, some forms of refractive surgery (such as photorefractive keratectomy) can cause traditional intraocular pressure measurements to appear normal when in fact the pressure may be abnormally high.\n\n【4】 #Classification\nCurrent consensus among ophthalmologists and optometrists define normal intraocular pressure as that between 10 mmHg and 20 mmHg. The average value of intraocular pressure is 15.5 mmHg with fluctuations of about 2.75 mmHg.\nOcular hypertension (OHT) is defined by intraocular pressure being higher than normal, in the absence of optic nerve damage or visual field loss.\nHypotony, or ocular hypotony, is typically defined as intraocular pressure equal to or less than 5 mmHg. Such low intraocular pressure could indicate fluid leakage and deflation of the eyeball.\n\n【5】 ## Daily variation\nIntraocular pressure varies throughout the night and day. The diurnal variation for normal eyes is between 3 and 6 mmHg and the variation may increase in glaucomatous eyes. During the night, intraocular pressure may not decrease  despite the slower production of aqueous humour. In the general population, IOP ranges between 10 and 21 mm Hg with a mean of about 15 or 16 mm Hg (plus or minus 3.5 mm Hg during a 24-hour cycle).\n\n【6】 ## Fitness and exercise\nThere is some inconclusive research that indicates that exercise could possibly affect IOP (some positively and some negatively). However, some other forms of exercise may raise IOP.\n\n【7】 ## Musical instruments\nPlaying some musical wind instruments has been linked to increases in intraocular pressure. One 2011 study focused on brass and woodwind instruments observed \"temporary and sometimes dramatic elevations and fluctuations in IOP\".\nAnother study found that the magnitude of increase in intraocular pressure correlates with the intraoral resistance associated with the instrument, and linked intermittent elevation of intraocular pressure from playing high-resistance wind instruments to incidence of visual field loss.\nThe range of intraoral pressure involved in various classes of ethnic wind instruments, such as Native American flutes, has been shown to be generally lower than Western classical wind instruments.\n\n【8】 ## Other factors\nIntraocular pressure also varies with a number of other factors such as heart rate, respiration, fluid intake, systemic medication and topical drugs. Alcohol consumption leads to a transient decrease in intraocular pressure and caffeine may increase intraocular pressure.\nTaken orally, glycerol (often mixed with fruit juice to reduce its sweet taste) can cause a rapid, temporary decrease in intraocular pressure.  This can be a useful initial emergency treatment of severely elevated pressure.\n\n【9】 #Significance\nOcular hypertension is the most important risk factor for glaucoma.\nIntraocular pressure has been measured as a secondary outcome in a systematic review comparing the effect of neuroprotective agents in slowing the progression of open angle glaucoma.\nDifferences in pressure between the two eyes is often clinically significant, and potentially associated with certain types of glaucoma, as well as  iritis or retinal detachment.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-05-08 01:37:59", "update_time": "2024-05-08 21:43:32"}

Public awareness of Pectus Excavatum is limited, so youths suffering of the disorder may feel very alone. Media coverage has been scarce.\nThe condition usually progresses during the time of rapid bone growth in the early teenage years. Estimates for the prevalence of this condition range from one in 150 to 1000 children. Though the cause is not certain, the male/female ratio is 3 to 1, and occurrences of the condition in family members have been reported in 35% to 45% of cases. These features may suggest a genetic component may be involved, although some authorities believe the condition occurs in a sporadic fashion. Incidence is especially high among patients with inherited connective tissue disorders such as Marfan syndrome.\n\n【2】 ## Surgery\nSurgical correction has been shown to repair any functional symptoms that may occur in the condition, such as respiratory problems or heart murmurs, provided that permanent damage has not already arisen from an extremely severe case.\nThe Ravitch technique is an invasive surgery that was developed in the 1950s to treat the condition. It involves cracking the ribs along the sternum, and reshaping the breastbone, cartilage, and ribs. It is usually kept in place with an apparatus worn around the chest. This method, because it is so invasive, is usually only recommended for adults or teenagers whose sternum has already hardened.\n\n【3】 ## The Vacuum Bell\nA relatively new alternative to surgery is the vacuum bell. It consists of a bowl shaped device which fits over the caved-in area; the air is then removed by the use of a hand pump. The vacuum created by this lifts the sternum upwards, lessening the severity of the deformity. As it is such a recent device there is currently no information as to whether it is effective in the long term.\n\n【4】 ## Cosmetic and light treatments\nThe cosmetic appearance of Pectus excavatum can reportedly be treated with a dermal filler called Bio-Alcamid. However, as this does nothing to alleviate the actual deformity it will not prevent any physiological symptoms caused by the condition.\nMild cases have also reportedly been treated with corset-like orthopedic support vests and exercise.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-05-08 01:37:59", "update_time": "2024-05-08 19:24:42"}

Influenza was confirmed by culture, hemagglutination inhibition antibodies, or investigational direct tests. Of 1,164 subjects with confirmed influenza, 89% had influenza A and 11% had influenza B. These trials served as the principal basis for efficacy evaluation, with more limited Phase II studies providing supporting information where necessary. Following randomization to either zanamivir or placebo (inhaled lactose vehicle), all subjects received instruction and supervision by a healthcare professional for the initial dose.\nPrincipal Results: The definition of time to improvement in major symptoms of influenza included no fever and self-assessment of “none” or “mild” for headache, myalgia, cough, and sore throat. A Phase II and a Phase III trial conducted in North America (total of over 600 influenza-positive subjects) suggested up to 1 day of shortening of median time to this defined improvement in symptoms in subjects receiving zanamivir compared with placebo, although statistical significance was not reached in either of these trials. In a trial conducted in the Southern Hemisphere (321 influenza-positive subjects), a 1.5-day difference in median time to symptom improvement was observed. Additional evidence of efficacy was provided by the European trial.\nOther Findings: There was no consistent difference in treatment effect in subjects with influenza A compared with influenza B; however, these trials enrolled smaller numbers of subjects with influenza B and thus provided less evidence in support of efficacy in influenza B.\nIn general, subjects with lower temperature (e.g. 38.2°C or less) or investigator-rated as having less severe symptoms at entry derived less benefit from therapy.\nNo consistent treatment effect was demonstrated in subjects with underlying chronic medical conditions, including respiratory or cardiovascular disease .\nSome fluctuation of symptoms was observed after the primary trial endpoint in both treatment groups.\n\n【3】 ### Pediatric Patients\nThe efficacy of RELENZA 10 mg inhaled twice daily for 5 days in the treatment of influenza in pediatric patients has been evaluated in a placebo-controlled trial conducted in North America and Europe, enrolling 471 subjects, aged 5 to 12 years (55% male, 90% Caucasian), within 36 hours of symptom onset. Of 346 subjects with confirmed influenza, 65% had influenza A and 35% had influenza B.\nAlthough this trial was designed to enroll children aged 5 to 12 years, the product is indicated only for children aged 7 years and older. This evaluation is based on the combination of lower estimates of treatment effect in 5- and 6-year-olds compared with the overall trial population, and evidence of inadequate inhalation through the DISKHALER in a pharmacokinetic trial .\n\n【4】 ## Prophylaxis of Influenza\nThe efficacy of RELENZA in preventing naturally occurring influenza illness has been demonstrated in 2 post-exposure prophylaxis trials in households and 2 seasonal prophylaxis trials during community outbreaks of influenza. The primary efficacy endpoint in these trials was the incidence of symptomatic, laboratory-confirmed influenza, defined as the presence of 2 or more of the following symptoms: oral temperature ≥100°F/37.8°C or feverishness, cough, headache, sore throat, and myalgia; and laboratory confirmation of influenza A or B by culture, PCR, or seroconversion (defined as a 4-fold increase in convalescent antibody titer from baseline).\nHousehold Prophylaxis Trials\nTwo trials assessed post-exposure prophylaxis in household contacts of an index case. Within 1.5 days of onset of symptoms in an index case, each household (including all family members aged 5 years and older) was randomized to RELENZA 10 mg inhaled once daily or placebo inhaled once daily for 10 days. In the first trial only, each index case was randomized to RELENZA 10 mg inhaled twice daily for 5 days or inhaled placebo twice daily for 5 days. In this trial, the proportion of households with at least 1 new case of symptomatic laboratory-confirmed influenza was reduced from 19.0% (32 of 168 households) for the placebo group to 4.1% (7 of 169 households) for the group receiving RELENZA.\nIn the second trial, index cases were not treated. The incidence of symptomatic laboratory-confirmed influenza was reduced from 19.0% (46 of 242 households) for the placebo group to 4.1% (10 of 245 households) for the group receiving RELENZA.\nSeasonal Prophylaxis Trials: Two seasonal prophylaxis trials assessed RELENZA 10 mg inhaled once daily versus placebo inhaled once daily for 28 days during community outbreaks. The first trial enrolled subjects aged 18 years or older (mean age: 29 years) from 2 university communities. The majority of subjects were unvaccinated (86%). In this trial, the incidence of symptomatic laboratory-confirmed influenza was reduced from 6.1% (34 of 554) for the placebo group to 2.0% (11 of 553) for the group receiving RELENZA.\nThe second seasonal prophylaxis trial enrolled subjects aged 12 to 94 years (mean age 60 years) with 56% of them older than 65 years. Sixty-seven percent of the subjects were vaccinated. In this trial, the incidence of symptomatic laboratory-confirmed influenza was reduced from 1.4% (23 of 1,685) for the placebo group to 0.2% (4 of 1,678) for the group receiving RELENZA.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-05-08 01:37:59", "update_time": "2024-05-08 19:43:31"}

This colorless, odorless, and hygroscopic crystalline solid is highly soluble in water.  It is used in various skin-care products. Glycolic acid is found in some sugar-crops.  A glycolate is a salt or ester of glycolic acid.\n\n【2】 #Preparation\nThere are multiple routes of synthesis of glycolic acid that are practiced today.  The majority of the world's supply of glycolic acid is made in a catalyzed reaction of formaldehyde with synthesis gas (carbonylation of formaldehyde) is a particularly economical preparative route.\nIt is also prepared by the reaction of chloroacetic acid with sodium hydroxide followed by re-acidification.\nIn this way, a few million kilograms are produced annually.  Other methods, not apparently in use, include hydrogenation of oxalic acid with nascent hydrogen and the hydrolysis of the cyanohydrin derived from formaldehyde. Some of today's glycolic acids are formic acid-free.  Glycolic acid can be isolated from natural sources, such as sugarcane, sugar beets, pineapple, cantaloupe, and unripe grapes.\nGlycolic acid can also be prepared using an enzymatic biochemical process which produces fewer impurities compared to traditional chemical synthesis, requires less energy in production and produces less co-product. Each route can be evaluated for its relative costs and benefits.\n\n【3】 #Uses\nGlycolic acid is used in the textile industry as a dyeing and tanning agent, in food processing as a flavoring agent and as a preservative, and in the pharmaceutical industry as a skin care agent. It is also used in adhesives and plastics. Glycolic acid is often included into emulsion polymers, solvents and additives for ink and paint in order to improve flow properties and impart gloss. It is used in surface treatment products that increase the coefficient of friction on tile flooring.\nDue to its excellent capability to penetrate skin, glycolic acid finds applications in skin care products, most often as a chemical peel performed by a dermatologist, plastic surgeon or licensed aesthetician in concentrations of 20 to 70% or at-home kits in lower concentrations between 10 and 20%. In addition to concentration, pH also plays a large part in determining the potency of glycolic acid in solution. Physician-strength peels can have a pH as low as 0.6 (strong enough to completely keratolyze the epidermis), while acidities for home peels can be as high as 2.5. Glycolic acid is used to improve the skin's appearance and texture. It may reduce wrinkles, acne scarring, hyperpigmentation and improve many other skin conditions, including actinic keratosis, hyperkeratosis, and seborrheic keratosis. Once applied, glycolic acid reacts with the upper layer of the epidermis, weakening the binding properties of the lipids that hold the dead skin cells together. This allows the stratum corneum to be exfoliated, exposing live skin cells.  Highly purified grades of glycolic acid are commercially available for personal care applications.\n\n【4】 #Safety\nGlycolic acid is a strong irritant depending on the pH levels.

(Steve) Goerke was named the first dean.\nIn 2003, the School of Public Health began awarding an undergraduate minor in public health.\n\n【2】 #Departments and degrees\nThe UCLA School of Public Health offers degrees in the following departments:\n- Biostatistics — MPH, MS, PhD, DrPH\n- Community Health Sciences — MPH, MS, PhD, DrPH\nUCLA also offers two interdepartmental degrees:\n\n【3】 - Molecular Toxicology — PhD\n- School of Public Health/African Studies Program (MPH / MA)\n\n【4】 #Research centers\nThe UCLA School of Public Health sponsors or is associated with the following research centers:\n- Center for Adolescent Health Promotion\n- The Division of Cancer Prevention and Control Center Research\n- UCLA Center for Health Policy Research\n- Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center\n\n【5】 #Notable alumni\nlist of UCLA Alumni Hall of Fame Members.\n\n【6】 #Notable faculty\n- Abdelmonem A.

It is one of the oxoacids of phosphorus, other important members being phosphoric acid (H3PO4)  and hypophosphorous acid (H3PO2).  Note that only the reduced phosphorus compounds are spelled with an \"ous\" ending.  Other names for this acid are orthophosphorous acid and dihydroxyphosphine oxide.\nHP(O)(OH)2 is the product of the hydrolysis of its acid anhydride, P4O6:\nAn analogous relationship connects H3PO4 and P4O\n\n【2】 #Tautomerization\nH3PO3 is better described with the structural formula HP(O)(OH)2.  This species exists in equilibrium with a minor tautomer P(OH)3.  The latter is called phosphorous acid.\nIt is sometimes called phosphorus acid or orthophosphorous acid. It has been shown to be a stable tautomer.\nThe dihydroxy form, HP(O)(OH)2, is called phosphonic acid.  Many of the reduced phosphorus acids are subject to similarly complicated equilibria involving shifts of H between O and P.  In the solid state, HP(O)(OH)2 is tetrahedral with one shorter P=O bond of 148 pm and two longer P-O(H) bonds of 154 pm.\n\n【3】 #Preparation\nAlthough commercially available, the acid is most commonly prepared by hydrolysis of phosphorus trichloride with water or steam:\nPotassium phosphite is a convenient precursor to phosphorous acid:\nIn practice aqueous potassium phosphite is treated with excess hydrochloric acid.  By concentrating the solution and precipitations with alcohols, the pure acid can be separated from the salt.\n\n【4】 #Polymerization\nAn oligophosphorous acid of the phosphonic acid tautomer refers to a few molecules of phosphorous acid condensed into a molecule with the loss of water.\nA general formula for such oligophosphorous acids is (HPO)nOn-1(OH)2, where n = 2, 3, 4, etc. oligo-. A polyphosphorous acid can have dozens of such phosphorous acid units condensed in a row with the loss of H2O for each unit added on.\nFor the phosphorous acid tautomer, an oligophosphorous acid also refers to a few molecules condensed into a molecule with the loss of H2O as each unit of P(OH)3 is added on, but the general formula differs:\n(HO)2POn-2P(OH)2, where n = 2, 3, 4, etc. oligo-. Here for both tautomers the repeat unit is (HPO2)n\nAgain, a polyphosphorous acid can have dozens of units condensed in a row. Regardless of the value of n, both polyphosphonic acid and polyphosphorous acid have the same chemical formula for any specific n, e.g. triphosphosphonic acid is H5P3O7 and triphosphorous acid is H5P3O7 for n=\nIn oligophosphorous acids of sufficient size, there are multiple OH that can result in the condensation of a cyclophosphorous acid that does not have multiple (HPO3) metaphosphoric acid units.\nHowever, the usual referral to a cyclophosphorous acid (cyclophosphonates or cyclophosphites) may be misnomers wherein the cyclic portion is carbon-based with a phosphorous acid side chain of one or more molecules, or one or a limited number of either of the two tautomers included in the ring but as a minority contributor. For example the effect of varying ring size on the phosphonate-phosphite tautomerism of cyclophosphorous acids has been shown. But the cyclophosphorous acids are biheteroorganic.\nBranching can also occur in either oligophosphorous or polyphosphorous tautomer. These are ultraoligophosphorous or ultrapolyphosphorous acids, ultraoligophosphonates and ultrapolyphosphonates, or ultraoligophosphites and ultrapolyphosphites, respectively for the phosphonic and phosphorous tautomers.\n\n【5】 #Acid-base properties\nPhosphorous acid is a diprotic acid, since the hydrogen bonded directly to the central phosphorus atom is not readily ionizable.  Chemistry examinations often test students' appreciation of the fact that all three hydrogen atoms are not acidic under aqueous conditions, in contrast with phosphoric acid.  HP(O)2(OH)− is a moderately strong acid.\nThe monodeprotonated species, HP(O)2(OH)− is called the phosphite ion.\nThe IUPAC (mostly organic) name is phosphonic acid. This nomenclature is commonly reserved for substituted derivatives, that is, organic group bonded to phosphorus, not simply an ester. For example, (CH3)PO(OH)2 is \"methylphosphonic acid\", which may of course form \"methylphosphonate\" esters.\nBoth phosphorous acid and its deprotonated forms are good reducing agents, although not necessarily quick to react. They are oxidized to phosphoric acid or its salts.  It reduces solutions of noble metal cations to the metals.\n\n【6】 ## Conversion to phosphine\nPhosphine, being a flammable and toxic gas, is inconvenient to store.  Fortunately this useful species is readily prepared by thermal decomposition of phosphorous acid, which degrades at about 180°C:\nSince phosphoric acid is a syrupy non-volatile liquid, the gaseous PH3 is readily separated.\n\n【7】 ## In agriculture\nA large quantity of phosphorous acid is used as phosphatic fertilizer. Pure phosphorous acid is also used for preparing phosphite salts, such as monopotassium phosphite or aluminum phosphonite.  These salts, as well as aqueous solutions of pure phosphorous acid, have shown effectiveness in controlling a variety of microbial plant diseases—in particular, treatment using either trunk injection or foliar sprays containing phosphorous acid salts is indicated in response to infections by phytophthora and pythium-type plant pathogens (both within class oomycetes, known as water molds), such as dieback/root rot and downy mildew. Anti-microbial products containing salts of phosphorous acid are marketed in Australia as 'Yates Anti-Rot'; and in the United States of America, for example, aluminum salts of phosphorous acid (known generically as 'Fosetyl-Al') are sold under the trade name 'Aliette'.\n\n【8】 ## As a chemical reagent\nPhosphorous acid is used in chemical reactions as a reducing agent that is somewhat less vigorous than the related hypophosphorous acid.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-05-08 01:37:59", "update_time": "2024-05-08 02:11:15"}

The most common unit of measurement of mutual information is the bit, when logarithms to the base 2 are used.\n\n【1】 #Definition of mutual information\nFormally, the mutual information of two discrete random variables X and Y can be defined as:\n\n【2】 In the continuous case, we replace summation by a definite double integral:\nThese definitions are ambiguous because the base of the log function is not specified. To disambiguate, the function I could be parameterized as I(X,Y,b) where b is the base. Alternatively, since the most common unit of measurement of mutual information is the bit, a base of 2 could be specified.\nIntuitively, mutual information measures the information that X and Y share: it measures how much knowing one of these variables reduces our uncertainty about the other.  For example, if X and Y are independent, then knowing X does not give any information about Y and vice versa, so their mutual information is zero.  At the other extreme, if X and Y are identical then all information conveyed by X is shared with Y: knowing X determines the value of Y and vice versa. As a result, the mutual information is the same as the uncertainty contained in Y (or X) alone, namely the entropy of Y (or X: clearly if X and Y are identical they have equal entropy).\n\n【3】 Mutual information is a measure of dependence in the following sense: I(X; Y) = 0 if and only if X and Y are independent random variables.  This is easy to see in one direction: if X and Y are independent, then p(x,y) = p(x) × p(y), and therefore:\nMoreover, mutual information is nonnegative (i.e. I(X;Y) ≥ 0; see below) and symmetric (i.e. I(X;Y) = I(Y;X)).\n\n【4】 #Relation to other quantities\nMutual information can be equivalently expressed as\nbegin{align}\nI(X;Y) & {} = H(X) - H(X|Y) \\\\\n& {} = H(Y) - H(Y|X) \\\\\n\n【5】 Intuitively, if entropy H(X) is regarded as a measure of uncertainty about a random variable, then H(X|Y) is a measure of what Y does not say about X. This is \"the amount of uncertainty remaining about X after Y is known\", and thus the right side of the first of these equalities can be read as \"the amount of uncertainty in X, minus the amount of uncertainty in X which remains after Y is known\", which is equivalent to \"the amount of uncertainty in X which is removed by knowing Y\". This corroborates the intuitive meaning of mutual information as the amount of information (that is, reduction in uncertainty) that knowing either variable provides about the other.\nNote that in the discrete case H(X|X) = 0 and therefore H(X) = I(X;X)\n\n【6】 Furthermore, let p(x|y) = p(x, y) / p(y).  Then\nI(X;Y) & {} = \\sum_y p(y) \\sum_x p(x|y) \\log_2 \\frac{p(x|y)}{p(x)} \\\\\n& {} =  \\sum_y p(y) \\; D_{\\mathrm{KL}}\\|p(x) \\\\\nThus mutual information can thus also be understood as the expectation of the Kullback-Leibler divergence of the univariate distribution p(x) of X from the conditional distribution p(x|y) of X given Y: the more different the distributions p(x|y) and p(x), the greater the information gain.\n\n【7】 #Variations of the mutual information\nSeveral variations on the mutual information have been proposed to suit various needs.  Among these are normalized variants and generalizations to more than two variables.\n\n【8】 ## Normalized variants\nNormalized variants of the mutual information are provided by the coefficients of constraint  or uncertainty coefficient\nC_{XY}=\\frac{I(X;Y)}{H(Y)} WikiBot 07:58, 10 August 2012 (UTC)\\mbox{and}WikiBot 07:58, 10 August 2012 (UTC) C_{YX}=\\frac{I(X;Y)}{H(X)}\nThe two coefficients are not necessarily equal. A more useful and symmetric scaled information measure is the redundancy which obtains a minimum of zero when the variables are independent and a maximum value of when one variable becomes completely redundant with the knowledge of the other. Another symmetrical measure is the symmetric uncertainty , given by which represents a weighted average of the two uncertainty coefficients .\nOther normalized versions are provided by the following expressions .\nfrac{I(X;Y)}{\\mbox{min}(H(X),H(Y))}, 07:58, 10 August 2012 (UTC)~~ \\frac{I(X;Y)}{H(X,Y)}, 07:58, 10 August 2012 (UTC)~~ \\frac{I(X;Y)}{\\sqrt{H(X)H(Y)}}\n\n【9】 ## Weighted variants\nIn the traditional formulation of the mutual information, each event or object  specified by (x,y) is weighted by the corresponding  probability p(x,y).  This assumes that all objects or events are equivalent apart from their probability of occurrence.  However, in some applications it may be the case that certain objects or events are more significant than others, or that certain patterns of association are more semantically important than others.\nFor example, the deterministic mapping \\,\nwhich places a weight w(x,y) on the probability of each variable value co-occurrence, p(x,y). This allows that certain probabilities may carry more or less significance than others, thereby allowing the quantification of relevant holistic or prägnanz factors.  In the above example, using larger relative weights for w\\, which may be desirable in some cases of pattern recognition, and the like.  There has been little mathematical work done on the weighted mutual information and its properties, however.\n\n【10】 ## Multiple-variable variants\nSeveral generalizations of mutual information to more than two random variables have been proposed, such as total correlation and interaction information, but a widely agreed on definition has not yet emerged.\n\n【11】 ## Absolute mutual information\nUsing the ideas of Kolmogorov complexity, one can consider the mutual information of two sequences independent of any probability distribution:\nI_K(X;Y) = K(X) - K(X|Y).\nTo establish that this quantity is symmetric up to a logarithmic factor (I_K(X;Y) \\approx I_K(Y;X)) requires the chain rule for Kolmogorov complexity Template:Harvard citation.\nApproximations of this quantity via compression can be used to define a distance measure to perform a hierarchical clustering of sequences without having any domain knowledge of the sequences Template:Harvard citation.\n\n【12】 #Applications of mutual information\nIn many applications, one wants to maximize mutual information (thus increasing dependencies), which is often equivalent to minimizing conditional entropy.  Examples include:\n- The channel capacity is equal to the mutual information, maximized over all input distributions.\n- Discriminative training procedures for hidden Markov models have been proposed based on the maximum mutual information (MMI) criterion.\n- RNA secondary structure prediction from a multiple sequence alignment.\n- Mutual information has been used as a criterion for feature selection and feature transformations in machine learning. It can be used to characterize both the relevance and redundancy of variables, such as the minimum redundancy feature selection.\n- Mutual information is often used as a significance function for the computation of collocations in corpus linguistics.\n- Detection of phase synchronization in time series analysis - In the infomax Independent component analysis algorithm\n- Average mutual information in delay embedding theorem is used for determining the embedding delay parameter.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": "语义不完整#1#1#X and Y can be defined as:没表述完", "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-05-08 01:37:59", "update_time": "2024-05-08 02:25:40"}

Ill persons, such as those who have strep throat or skin infections, are most likely to spread the infection. Persons who carry the bacteria but have no symptoms are much less contagious. Treating an infected person with an antibiotic for 24 hours or longer generally eliminates their ability to spread the bacteria. However, it is important to complete the entire course of antibiotics as prescribed. It is not likely that household items like plates, cups, or toys spread these bacteria.\n\n【2】 #Pathophysiology\nSevere, sometimes life-threatening, GAS disease may occur when bacteria get into parts of the body where bacteria usually are not found, such as the blood, muscle, or the lungs. These infections are termed \"invasive GAS disease.\" Two of the most severe, but least common, forms of invasive GAS disease are necrotizing fasciitis and Streptococcal Toxic Shock Syndrome. Necrotizing fasciitis (occasionally described by the media as \"the flesh-eating bacteria\") destroys muscles, fat, and skin tissue. Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS), causes blood pressure to drop rapidly and organs (e.g. kidney, liver, lungs) to fail. STSS is not the same as the \"toxic shock syndrome\" frequently associated with tampon usage.\n\n【3】 ## Virulence factors\nS. pyogenes has several virulence factors that enable it to attach to host tissues, evade the immune response, and spread by penetrating host tissue layers.  A carbohydrate capsule composed of hyaluronic acid surrounds the bacterium, protecting it from phagocytosis by neutrophils. In addition, the capsule and several factors embedded in the cell wall, including M protein, lipoteichoic acid, and protein F (SfbI) facilitate attachment to various host cells.  M protein also inhibits opsonization by the alternative complement pathway by binding to host complement regulators.  M protein found on some serotypes are also able to prevent opsonization by binding to fibrinogen.  However, the M protein is also the weakest point in this pathogen's defense as antibodies produced by the immune system against M protein target the bacteria for engulfment by phagocytes.  M proteins are unique to each strain, and identification can be used clinically to confirm the strain causing an infection.\nS. pyogenes releases a number of proteins, including several virulence factors, into its host:\n\n【4】 ### Severe streptococcal infections\nSome strains of group A streptococci (GAS) cause severe infection. Those at greatest risk include children with chickenpox; persons with suppressed immune systems; burn victims; elderly persons with cellulitis, diabetes, blood vessel disease, or cancer; and persons taking steroid treatments or chemotherapy. Intravenous drug users also are at high risk. GAS is an important cause of puerperal fever world-wide, causing serious infection and, if not promptly diagnosed and treated, death in newly delivered mothers. Severe GAS disease may also occur in healthy persons with no known risk factors.\nAll severe GAS infections may lead to shock, multisystem organ failure, and death. Early recognition and treatment are critical. Diagnostic tests include blood counts and urinalysis as well as cultures of blood or fluid from a wound site. The antibiotic of choice is penicillin, to which GAS is particularly susceptible and has never been found to be resistant.  Erythromycin and clindamycin are other treatment options, though resistance to these antibiotics exists.\n\n【5】 ## Why does invasive group A streptococcal disease occur?\nInvasive GAS infections occur when the bacteria get past the defenses of the person who is infected. This may occur when a person has sores or other breaks in the skin that allow the bacteria to get into the tissue, or when the person’s ability to fight off the infection is decreased because of chronic illness or an illness that affects the immune system. Also, some virulent strains of GAS are more likely to cause severe disease than others.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": "语义不完整#3#3#virulence factors, into its host: 后面缺少内容", "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-05-08 01:37:59", "update_time": "2024-05-08 02:06:27"}

Greenhouse gases are essential to maintaining the temperature of the Earth; without them the planet would be so cold as to be uninhabitable. However, an excess of greenhouse gases can raise the temperature of a planet to lethal levels, as on Venus where the 96.5% carbon dioxide (CO2) atmosphere results in surface temperatures of about  467 °C (872 °F). Greenhouse gases are produced by many natural and industrial processes, which currently result in CO2 levels of 380 ppmv in the atmosphere. Based on ice-core samples and records  current levels of CO2 are approximately 100 ppmv higher than during immediately pre-industrial times, when direct human influence was negligible.\n\n【2】 #The greenhouse effect\nWhen sunlight reaches the surface of the Earth, some of it is absorbed and warms the surface. Because the Earth's surface is much cooler than the sun, it radiates energy at much longer wavelengths than the sun does, peaking in the infrared at about 10 µm. The atmosphere absorbs these longer wavelengths more effectively than it does the shorter wavelengths from the sun. The absorption of this longwave radiant energy warms the atmosphere; the atmosphere is also warmed by transfer of sensible and latent heat from the surface. Greenhouse gases also emit longwave radiation both upward to space and downward to the surface. The downward part of this longwave radiation emitted by the atmosphere is the \"greenhouse effect\". The term is a misnomer though, as this process is not the mechanism that warms greenhouses.\nOn earth, the most abundant greenhouse gases are, in order of relative abundance:\n- water vapor - carbon dioxide\n- methane\n- nitrous oxide\n- ozone\n- CFCs\nThe most important greenhouse gases are:\n- water vapor, which causes about 36–70% of the greenhouse effect on Earth. (Note clouds typically affect climate differently from other forms of atmospheric water.)\nIt is not possible to state that a certain gas causes a certain percentage of the greenhouse effect, because the influences of the various gases are not additive. (The higher ends of the ranges quoted are for the gas alone; the lower ends, for the gas counting overlaps.) Other greenhouse gases include, but are not limited to, nitrous oxide, sulfur hexafluoride, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and chlorofluorocarbons .\nThe major atmospheric constituents (nitrogen, N2 and oxygen, O2) are not greenhouse gases. This is because homonuclear diatomic molecules such as N2 and O2 neither absorb nor emit infrared radiation, as there is no net change in the dipole moment of these molecules when they vibrate. Molecular vibrations occur at energies that are of the same magnitude as the energy of the photons on infrared light. Heteronuclear diatomics such as CO or HCl absorb IR; however, these molecules are short-lived in the atmosphere owing to their reactivity and solubility. As a consequence they do not contribute significantly to the greenhouse effect.\nLate 19th century scientists experimentally discovered that N2 and O2 did not absorb infrared radiation (called, at that time, \"dark radiation\") and that CO2 and many other gases did absorb such radiation. It was recognized in the early 20th century that the known major greenhouse gases in the atmosphere caused the earth's temperature to be higher than it would have been without the greenhouse gases.\n\n【3】 #Natural and anthropogenic\nMost greenhouse gases have both natural and anthropogenic sources. During the pre-industrial holocene, concentrations of these gases were roughly constant. Since the industrial revolution, concentrations of all the long-lived greenhouse gases have increased due to human actions.\nIce cores provide evidence for variation in greenhouse gas concentrations over the past 800,000 years. Both CO2 and CH4 vary between glacial and interglacial phases, and concentrations of these gases correlate strongly with temperature. Before the ice core record, direct measurements do not exist. Various proxies and modelling suggests large variations; 500 Myr ago CO2 levels were likely 10 times higher than now. Indeed higher CO2 concentrations are thought to have prevailed throughout most of the Phanerozoic eon, with concentrations four to six times current concentrations during the Mesozoic era, and ten to fifteen times current concentrations during the early Palaeozoic era until the middle of the Devonian period, about 400 Mya.  The spread of land plants is thought to have reduced CO2 concentrations during the late Devonian, and plant activities as both sources and sinks of CO2 have since been important in providing stabilising feedbacks.\nEarlier still, a 200-million year period of intermittent, widespread glaciation extending close to the equator (Snowball Earth) appears to have been ended suddenly, about 550 Mya, by a colossal volcanic outgassing which raised the CO2 concentration of the atmosphere abruptly to 12%, about 350 times modern levels, causing extreme greenhouse conditions and carbonate deposition as limestone at the rate of about 1mm per day. This episode marked the close of the Precambrian eon, and was succeeded by the generally warmer conditions of the Phanerozoic, during which multicellular animal and plant life evolved. No volcanic carbon dioxide emission of comparable scale has occurred since. In the modern era, emissions to the atmosphere from volcanoes are only about 1% of emissions from human sources.\n\n【4】 #Anthropogenic greenhouse gases\nSince about 1750 human activity has increased the concentration of carbon dioxide and of some other important greenhouse gases. Natural sources of carbon dioxide are more than 20 times greater than sources due to human activity, but over periods longer than a few years natural sources are closely balanced by natural sinks such as weathering of continental rocks and photosynthesis of carbon compounds by plants and marine plankton. As a result of this balance, the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide remained between 260 and 280 parts per million for the 10,000 years between the end of the last glacial maximum and the start of the industrial era.\nSome of the main sources of greenhouse gases due to human activity include:\n- burning of fossil fuels and deforestation leading to higher carbon dioxide concentrations. Land use change (mainly deforestation in the tropics) account for up to one third of total anthropogenic CO2 emissions.\n- livestock enteric fermentation and manure management, paddy rice farming, land use and wetland changes, pipeline losses, and covered vented landfill emissions leading to higher methane atmospheric concentrations. Many of the newer style fully vented septic systems that enhance and target the fermentation process also are sources of atmospheric methane.\n- use of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) in refrigeration systems, and use of CFCs and halons in fire suppression systems and manufacturing processes.\n- agricultural activities, including the use of fertilizers, that lead to higher nitrous oxide concentrations.\nThe seven sources of CO2 from fossil fuel combustion are (with percentage contributions for 2000–2004):\n- Solid fuels (e.g. coal): 35%\n- Gaseous fuels (e.g. natural gas): 20%\n- Flaring gas industrially and at wells: <1%\n- Cement production: 3%\n- Non-fuel hydrocarbons: <1%\n- The \"international bunkers\" of shipping and air transport not included in national inventories: 4%\nThe U.S. EPA ranks the major greenhouse gas contributing end-user sectors in the following order: industrial, transportation, residential, commercial and agricultural.\nMajor sources of an individual's GHG include home heating and cooling, electricity consumption, and transportation. Corresponding conservation measures are improving home building insulation, compact fluorescent lamps and choosing energy-efficient vehicles.\nCarbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and three groups of fluorinated gases (sulfur hexafluoride, HFCs, and PFCs) are the major greenhouse gases and the subject of the Kyoto Protocol, which came into force in 20\nAlthough CFCs are greenhouse gases, they are regulated by the Montreal Protocol, which was motivated by CFCs' contribution to ozone depletion rather than by their contribution to global warming. Note that ozone depletion has only a minor role in greenhouse warming though the two processes often are confused in the media.\n\n【5】 #Role of water vapor\nWater vapor is a naturally occurring greenhouse gas and accounts for the largest percentage of the greenhouse effect, between 36% and 66%. Water vapor concentrations fluctuate regionally, but human activity does not directly affect water vapor concentrations except at local scales (for example, near irrigated fields).\nThe Clausius-Clapeyron relation establishes that warmer air can hold more water vapor per unit volume. Current state-of-the-art climate models predict that increasing water vapor concentrations in warmer air will amplify the greenhouse effect created by anthropogenic greenhouse gases while maintaining nearly constant relative humidity. Thus water vapor acts as a positive feedback to the forcing provided by greenhouse gases such as CO\n\n【6】 #Greenhouse gas emissions\nMeasurements from Antarctic ice cores show that just before industrial emissions started, atmospheric CO2 levels were about 280 parts per million by volume (ppm; the units µL/L are occasionally used and are identical to parts per million by volume). From the same ice cores it appears that CO2 concentrations stayed between 260 and 280 ppm during the preceding 10,000 years. Studies using evidence from stomata of fossilized leaves suggest greater variability, with CO2 levels above 300 ppm during the period 7,000–10,000 years ago, though others have argued that these findings more likely reflect calibration/contamination problems rather than actual CO2 variability.\nSince the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, the concentrations of many of the greenhouse gases have increased. The concentration of CO2 has increased by about 100 ppm (i.e. from 280 ppm to 380 ppm). The first 50 ppm increase took place in about 200 years, from the start of the Industrial Revolution to around 1973; the next 50 ppm increase took place in about 33 years, from 1973 to 2006 Many observations are available online in a variety of Atmospheric Chemistry Observational Databases. The greenhouse gases with the largest radiative forcing are:\n\n【7】 ## Recent rates of change and emission\nThe sharp acceleration in CO2 emissions since 2000 of >3% y−1 (>2 ppm y−1) from 1.1% y−1 during the 1990s is attributable to the lapse of formerly declining trends in carbon intensity of both developing and developed nations. Although over 3/4 of cumulative anthropogenic CO2 is still attributable to the developed world, China was responsible for most of global growth in emissions during this period. Localised plummeting emissions associated with the collapse of the Soviet Union have been followed by slow emissions growth in this region due to more efficient energy use, made necessary by the increasing proportion of it that is exported. In comparison, methane has not increased appreciably, and N2O by 0.25% y−\n\n【8】 ### Asia\nAtmospheric levels of the main greenhouse gas have set another new peak in a sign of the industrial rise of Asian economies led by China.  Over the 2000-2010 interval China is expected to increase its carbon emissions by 600 MT, largely because of the rapid construction of old-fashioned power plants in poorer internal provinces.\n\n【9】 ### United States\nThe United States emitted 16.3% more GHG in 2005 than it did in 1990. According to a preliminary estimate by the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency, the largest national producer of CO2 emissions since 2006 has been China with an estimated annual production of about 6200 megatonnes.  The U.S. is followed by the United States with about 5,800 megatonnes.\nRelative to 2005, China's fossil CO2 emissions increased in 2006 by 8.7%, while in the USA, comparable CO2 emissions decreased in 2006 by 1.4%. The agency notes that its estimates do not include some CO2 sources of uncertain magnitude. Although these tonnages are small compared to the CO2 in the Earth's atmosphere, they are significantly larger than pre-industrial levels.\n\n【10】 ## Long-term trend\nAtmospheric carbon dioxide concentration is increasing at an increasing rate.  In the 1960s, the average annual increase was only 37% of what it was in 2000 through 20\n\n【11】 #Removal from the atmosphere and global warming potential\nAside from water vapor, which has a residence time of days, most greenhouse gases take many years to leave the atmosphere. Although it is not easy to know with precision how long it takes greenhouse gases to leave the atmosphere, there are estimates for the principal greenhouse gases.\nGreenhouse gases can be removed from the atmosphere by various processes:\n- as a consequence of a physical change (condensation and precipitation remove water vapor from the atmosphere).\n- as a consequence of chemical reactions within the atmosphere. This is the case for methane. It is oxidized by reaction with naturally occurring hydroxyl radical, OH· and degraded to CO2 and water vapor at the end of a chain of reactions (the contribution of the CO2 from the oxidation of methane is not included in the methane Global warming potential). This also includes solution and solid phase chemistry occurring in atmospheric aerosols.\n- as a consequence of dissociative ionization caused by high energy cosmic rays or lightning discharges, which break molecular bonds. For example, lightning forms N anions from N2 which then react with O2 to form NO\n\n【12】 ## Atmospheric lifetime\nJacob  defines the lifetime \\tau of an atmospheric species X in a one-box model as the average time that a molecule of X remains in the box. Mathematically \\tau can be defined as the ratio of the mass m (in kg) of X in the box to its removal rate, which is the sum of the flow of X out of the box\n(F_{out}), chemical loss of X\n(L), and deposition of X\n(D)\n(all in kg/sec):\ntau = \\frac{m}{F_{out}+L+D}\nThe atmospheric lifetime of a species therefore measures the time required to restore equilibrium following an increase in its concentration in the atmosphere. Individual atoms or molecules may be lost or deposited to sinks such as the soil, the oceans and other waters, or vegetation and other biological systems, reducing the excess to background concentrations. The average time taken to achieve this is the mean lifetime. The atmospheric lifetime of CO2 is often incorrectly stated to be only a few years because that is the average time for any CO2 molecule to stay in the atmosphere before being removed by mixing into the ocean, photosynthesis, or other processes. However, this ignores the balancing fluxes of CO2 into the atmosphere from the other reservoirs. It is the net concentration changes of the various greenhouse gases by all sources and sinks that determines atmospheric lifetime, not just the removal processes.\nExamples of the atmospheric lifetime and GWP for several greenhouse gases include:\n- CO2 has a variable atmospheric lifetime, and cannot be specified precisely. Recent work indicates that recovery from a large input of atmospheric CO2 from burning fossil fuels will result in an effective lifetime of tens of thousands of years. Carbon dioxide is defined to have a GWP of 1 over all time periods.\n- Methane has an atmospheric lifetime of 12 ± 3 years and a GWP of 62 over 20 years, 23 over 100 years and 7 over 500 years. The decrease in GWP associated with longer times is associated with the fact that the methane is degraded to water and CO2 by chemical reactions in the atmosphere.\n- Nitrous oxide has an atmospheric lifetime of 120 years and a GWP of 296 over 100 years.\n- Tetrafluoromethane has an atmospheric lifetime of 50,000 years and a GWP of 5700 over 100 years.\n\n【13】 The use of CFC-12 (except some essential uses) has been phased out due to its ozone depleting properties. The phasing-out of less active HCFC-compounds will be completed in 20\n\n【14】 ## Airborne fraction\nAirborne fraction (AF) is the proportion of a emission\n(e.g. CO2) remaining in the atmosphere after a specified time. Canadell  define the annual AF as the ratio of the atmospheric CO2 increase in a given year to that year’s total emissions, and calculate that of the average 9.1 PgC y-1 of total anthropogenic emissions from 2000 to 2006, the AF was 0.45. For CO2 the AF over the last 50 years  has been increasing at 0.25±0.21%/year.\n\n【15】 ## Global warming potential\nThe global warming potential (GWP) depends on both the efficiency of the molecule as a greenhouse gas and its atmospheric lifetime. GWP is measured relative to the same mass of CO2 and evaluated for a specific timescale. Thus, if a molecule has a high GWP on a short time scale (say 20 years) but has only a short lifetime, it will have a large GWP on a 20 year scale but a small one on a 100 year scale. Conversely, if a molecule has a longer atmospheric lifetime than CO2 its GWP will increase with time.\n\n【16】 #Related effects\nCarbon monoxide has an indirect radiative effect by elevating concentrations of methane and tropospheric ozone through scavenging of atmospheric constituents (e.g. the hydroxyl radical, OH) that would otherwise destroy them. Carbon monoxide is created when carbon-containing fuels are burned incompletely. Through natural processes in the atmosphere, it is eventually oxidized to carbon dioxide. Carbon monoxide has an atmospheric lifetime of only a few months and as a consequence is spatially more variable than longer-lived gases.\nAnother potentially important indirect effect comes from methane, which in addition to its direct radiative impact also contributes to ozone formation. Shindell et al  argue that the contribution to climate change from methane is at least double previous estimates as a result of this effect.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": "语义不完整#6#6# largest radiative forcing are:后面缺少内容", "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-05-08 01:37:59", "update_time": "2024-05-08 01:56:49"}

Most adverse effects occur at the start of treatment and usually subside within a few days of continued treatment\nPrucalopride is available in 1-mg and 2-mg tablets. The acquisition cost of prucalopride 1 mg is £38.69 for a pack of 28 tablets. The acquisition cost of prucalopride 2 mg is £59.52 for a pack of 28 tablets (excluding VAT; 'British National Formulary' , 60th edition). The manufacturer estimated that the annual cost of treatment with prucalopride is £622 for adult women and £403 for older women (excluding any monitoring costs), assuming that each woman receives treatment for an average of 220 days each year. Costs may vary in different settings because of negotiated procurement discounts\n\n【4】 #The manufacturer's submission\n\n【5】 The manufacturer described nine trials that provided evidence on the clinical effectiveness of prucalopride in people with chronic constipation. There were three pivotal phase III randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in adults (aged 18–65 years) with chronic constipation (PRU-INT-6, PRU-USA-11 and PRU-USA-13), one phase III, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in older people (65 years or older, PRU-INT-12), one trial in adults (18 years or older)  with opioid-induced constipation (PRU-INT-8), one retreatment study (PRU-USA-28) and three extended, open-label, single-arm, observational studies (PRU-INT-10, PRU-USA-22 and PRU-INT-17). The key clinical evidence presented by the manufacturer was derived from the three pivotal trials, which reported the efficacy of prucalopride compared with placebo in adults, and PRU-INT-12, which reported the efficacy of prucalopride compared with placebo in older people. The number of people randomised to PRU-INT-6, PRU-USA-11, PRU-USA-13 and PRU-INT-12 was 720, 628, 651 and 305 respectively. Approximately 90% of people in the pivotal trials were women. The manufacturer also presented other trials, which reported additional safety considerations and response rates . The manufacturer's submission stated that people were enrolled in the pivotal trials and PRU-INT-12 if they had a history of chronic constipation (defined as no more than two spontaneous complete bowel movements per week) and one or more of the following for at least 6 months before the screening visit:\nstraining during at least 25% of bowel movements very hard or hard stools in at least 25% of bowel movements sensation of incomplete evacuation for at least 25% of bowel movements.\nThere was a 2-week run-in period for each pivotal trial and for PRU-INT-12, in which no laxative medication (except for rescue medication) was allowed. People in the pivotal trials were then randomised 1:1:1 to prucalopride 2 mg, prucalopride 4 mg or placebo. People in PRU-INT-12 were also randomised to prucalopride 1 mg. If people had not had a bowel movement for 3 days or more, they could receive a single dose of 15 mg bisacodyl as rescue medication (medications used for quick relief of symptoms). If a bowel movement did not occur, the dose of bisacodyl could be increased; if there was still no bowel movement after this, an enema could be administered. In the pivotal trials people were treated for 12 weeks and in PRU-INT-12 people were treated for 4 weeks. Data were collected at 4- and 12-week time points in the pivotal trials and at 4 weeks in PRU-INT\nThe proportion of people treated with prucalopride 2 mg in the pivotal trials who had an average increase of one or more spontaneous complete bowel movements per week (the secondary outcome measure) during weeks 1–4 ranged from 41.0% to 56.5% compared with 20.9% to 25.5% for placebo (all p ≤ 0.001). During weeks 1–12 of treatment, the proportion of people who had an average increase of one or more spontaneous complete bowel movements per week ranged from 38.1% to 50.3% for prucalopride 2 mg compared with 20.9% to 27.5% for placebo (all p ≤ 0.001).\nIn PRU-INT-12 the proportion of people treated with prucalopride who had an average of three or more spontaneous complete bowel movements per week during weeks 1–4 was 39.5% for prucalopride 1 mg and 32.0% for prucalopride 2 mg, compared with 20.0% for placebo . In addition, the proportion of people treated with prucalopride who had an average increase of one or more spontaneous complete bowel movements per week during weeks 1–4 was 61.1% for prucalopride 1 mg and 56.9% for prucalopride 2 mg compared with 33.8% for placebo .\nSurveys of the SF-36 mental component summary and the SF-36 physical component summary were taken during the run-in period and at weeks 4 and 12 of the pivotal trials. No trials showed statistically significantly greater improvements in SF-36 scores for prucalopride 2 mg compared with placebo at week 12. A statistically significant improvement in the SF-36 physical component summary at week 4 was only seen in the PRU-INT-6 study for prucalopride 2 mg compared with placebo . Additional evidence provided by the manufacturer in response to the appraisal consultation document suggested, however, that when only the cohort of patients who responded to treatment was compared with placebo, a statistically significant difference between the effect of prucalopride and placebo was seen.\nThe following three single-arm extension studies were designed to assess the long-term tolerability and safety of prucalopride:\nPRU-INT-10: included people from PRU-INT-6 (pivotal trial) and PRU-INT-12 (trial in older people).\nPRU-USA-22: included people from PRU-USA-3 (phase II dose–response trial), PRU-USA-11 and PRU-USA-13 (pivotal trials), PRU-USA-21 (phase II dose–response trial), PRU-USA-25 (phase III dose–titration trial), PRU-USA-27 (opioid-induced chronic constipation trial) and PRU-USA-28 (phase III retreatment trial).\nPRU-INT-17: included people from PRU-INT-8 and PRU-INT-14 (both opioid-induced chronic constipation trials). Studies PRU-INT-10, PRU-USA-22 and PRU-INT-17 had durations of 24, 36 and 12 months respectively. People received prucalopride doses ranging from 0 to 4 mg. Results from these studies reported that prucalopride treatment was associated with an improvement in constipation from baseline at all time points (this was statistically significant in PRU-INT-10 and PRU-USA-22) and a decrease in the use of laxatives. At 12 months, on average, less than 50% of people remained in these trials. The reasons for stopping treatment included insufficient treatment response (18%), withdrawal of consent (15%) and adverse events (9%). However for the three trials, most people (approximately 45%) discontinued treatment because the previous trial sponsor decided to stop the prucalopride development programme worldwide.\nTwo additional analyses were presented. One incorporated data for adult women only and one incorporated data for older women only. For the first 12 weeks, the model for adult women included randomised controlled trial data for all women treated with prucalopride 2 mg. Additional observational trial data were incorporated up to a further 40 weeks after the initial trial period. The model in older women incorporated randomised controlled trial data for women treated with prucalopride 1 mg in the first 4 weeks followed by observational data for up to 1 year.\nNo discounting was applied in the model because both costs and utility values were modelled for 52 weeks. The only costs incorporated in the economic model were the list prices of prucalopride 2 mg (£2.13 per tablet) and prucalopride 1 mg (£1.38 per tablet). Costs and utility values for placebo plus rescue therapy were not included in the model. The manufacturer assumed that women would take their treatment for only part of the year (220 days). Adverse events and their associated costs were not included in the model. The manufacturer acknowledged that the rates of adverse events were comparable between prucalopride and placebo and therefore they considered that including these events would not affect the outcome of the analysis.\nClinical data incorporated in the model were derived from the three pivotal trials, two trials in older people (PRU-INT-12 and PRU-USA-26) and the extension studies. Patient characteristics from these studies were used to inform the disease states in the model. Further patient characteristics were obtained from other trials not fully described in the manufacturer's submission, including three additional dose–response trials (PRU-INT-1, PRU-INT-2 and PRU-USA-3) and two phase II trials (PRU-FRA-1 and PRU-GBR-4). No methods or results for these trials were included in the submission. PAC-SYM and PAC-QOL data from the clinical trials were mapped to EQ-5D through SF-36 scores using the generalised least squares regression method. People who had chronic constipation who did not respond to prucalopride were assumed to have no quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gain.\nThe manufacturer also presented an analysis that included all women who had an additional bowel movement per week (the secondary outcome measure in the pivotal trials). The manufacturer estimated that, for all women, the annual cost per person to reach this secondary outcome would be £498 with an average QALY gain of 0.0277, resulting in an ICER of £18,000 per QALY gained. For adult women, the cost would be £622 with an average QALY gain of 0.0342, resulting in an ICER of £18,000 per QALY gained. The cost for older women was £403 with a QALY gain of 0.0255, resulting in an ICER of £15,800 per QALY gained.\nthe effect of constipation severity at baseline on treatment effectiveness (that is, if the treatment effect is assumed to be the same regardless of baseline severity, the probability of prucalopride being cost effective at £20,000 per QALY gained is increased)\nthe ability to identify women whose constipation did not respond to prucalopride at a very early stage of treatment the acquisition cost of prucalopride the utility values derived from mapping PAC outcome measures (PAC-SYM and PAC-QOL) to EQ-5D scores.\nOverall, the ERG noted that there was a considerable quantity of clinical-effectiveness evidence in adults that suggested an improvement in chronic constipation for people treated with prucalopride compared with placebo. The ERG calculated the weighted average of the effect of prucalopride across the pivotal trials and estimated that 28% of people reached the primary outcome of three or more spontaneous complete bowel movements per week after treatment with prucalopride 2 mg compared with 10.6% of people treated with placebo after 1­4 weeks. After 1­12 weeks, 23.8% of people treated with prucalopride 2 mg reached the primary outcome compared with 11.4% of people treated with placebo.\nAssuming that people who responded to treatment with prucalopride would receive treatment for a mean of 220 days or 365 days.\nUsing response rates taken from pooled trial estimates at week 4 calculated in the effectiveness review.\nAllowing for the possibility that adverse events may be higher in the prucalopride arm than the placebo arm by increasing costs by 5% and reducing QALY gain by 5% in the prucalopride arm.\nReducing the effectiveness (QALY) of prucalopride and placebo uniformly by 25%, 50% and 75% to allow for possible variation in the regression method used to calculate the QALYs.The ERG concluded that the results from its sensitivity analysis were not significantly different from those provided by the manufacturer.\n\n【6】 #Clinical effectiveness\nThe Committee discussed the nature of chronic constipation and current clinical practice for the treatment of people with laxative-refractory chronic constipation. The clinical specialists stated that chronic constipation has a wide spectrum of severity and that for a minority of people with intractable constipation there can be very low quality of life and feelings of hopelessness. The Committee understood that current practice is a stepped approach to management starting with lifestyle and dietary changes. If these changes provide inadequate relief, different classes of oral laxatives are available. For some people chronic constipation can become intractable, and relatively invasive procedures (such as suppositories, enemas, rectal irrigation and manual disimpaction) may be tried. The Committee heard from the manufacturer that the intended position of prucalopride in the treatment pathway for chronic constipation is after failure of oral laxatives because of inadequate efficacy or intolerance. The Committee noted the clinical specialists' advice that people who have had an inadequate response to an oral laxative often try many different types before considering invasive options. The Committee was aware that the scope for this appraisal was to consider the use of prucalopride in women with chronic constipation in whom standard laxative regimens have failed to provide adequate relief, and for whom invasive procedures are being considered.\nThe Committee noted from the ERG's analysis that a substantial proportion of people with chronic constipation in the pivotal trials responded to placebo . The clinical specialists stated that it was not unusual for people with gastrointestinal conditions to respond to placebo, and that they were not surprised by the high response to placebo in the trials. The Committee was assured that in clinical practice, any treatment that provides at least a 10% improvement in response over placebo is considered to be clinically meaningful. The Committee considered that the available data demonstrated that prucalopride was clinically effective in providing relief to women with laxative-refractory chronic constipation.\n\n【7】 #Cost effectiveness\nThe Committee considered the quality-of-life data presented in the manufacturer's submission. The Committee noted that disease specific quality-of-life measures (PAC-QOL and PAC-SYM) were mapped to EQ-5D using SF-36 scores obtained from the trials. The Committee heard from the clinical specialists that people with a PAC-QOL score of 4 (equating to an EQ-5D of 0.585), as observed in the clinical trials, have substantially limited quality of life. Although PAC-QOL and therefore EQ-5D improved with prucalopride treatment, the Committee noted that this was not reflected in the SF-36 data directly measured in the trials. The Committee was aware of the concerns raised by the ERG that the assumptions used in the mapping equation could not be tested and may therefore not be robust. It questioned if SF-36 data from the trials would give similar EQ-5D improvement had they been used in the model; and why this had not been tested in a sensitivity analysis. The manufacturer stated that further SF-36 data (not in the submission) for people whose constipation responded to treatment showed statistically significant improvement for prucalopride compared with placebo. Sensitivity analyses of these outcomes were conducted by the manufacturer and were considered to be consistent with results from the ERG's analyses when assumptions about the acquisition cost of prucalopride and the number of days on treatment were varied. The Committee concluded that changing the mapping equation to include SF-36 instead of PAC-QOL would be unlikely to alter the results of the model substantially.\nThe Committee discussed the manufacturer's ICER calculations and the ERG's exploratory analysis, in which the ERG ran the manufacturer's model using different alternative scenarios and assumptions. The Committee noted that in the base case presented by the manufacturer, the average cost of prucalopride for all women was £498 with a QALY gain of 0.0316, resulting in an ICER of £15,700 per QALY gained. The average cost of prucalopride for adult women was £622 with a QALY gain of 0.0369, resulting in an ICER of £16,800 per QALY gained. The average cost of prucalopride for older women was £403 with a QALY gain of 0.0342, resulting in an ICER of £11,700 per QALY gained. Although the Committee had concerns about the generalisability of the populations selected for the clinical trials to the decision problem and about the extrapolation of benefits beyond the trials, the Committee concluded that the ERG had shown the manufacturer's cost-effectiveness estimates to be reasonably stable under varied assumptions.\nThe Committee considered the true resource costs of treating chronic constipation when laxatives fail to provide adequate relief, such as referrals to secondary care, rectal irrigation and surgery. It agreed that these costs could be reduced by using prucalopride. Based on these considerations, the Committee agreed that the costs of chronic constipation presented by the manufacturer in its economic model were probably conservative and if the true resource costs were included, it was likely that the ICERs presented by the manufacturer would be reduced.\n\n【8】 #Summary of Appraisal Committee's key conclusions\nTA211(STA)\nAppraisal title: Prucalopride for the treatment of chronic constipation in women\n\n【9】 Key conclusion\nPrucalopride is recommended as an option for the treatment of chronic constipation only in women for whom treatment with at least two laxatives from different classes, at the highest tolerated recommended doses for at least 6 months, has failed to provide adequate relief and invasive treatment for constipation is being considered.\nIf treatment with prucalopride is not effective after 4 weeks, the woman should be re-examined and the benefit of continuing treatment reconsidered.\nCurrent practice\nClinical need of patients, including the availability of alternative treatments\nThe Committee noted that for some people chronic constipation can become intractable, and relatively invasive procedures (such as suppositories, enemas, rectal irrigation and manual disimpaction) may be tried when oral laxatives fail to provide adequate relief.

In the Western world, the Krukenberg procedure is reserved for blind patients with bilateral amputations, because it can provide the patient with tactile sensation.\nThe procedure preserves proprioception and stereognosis in the functional stump to allow for effective maneuvering.  Once this procedure is performed, it does not preclude the use of a functional prosthesis. Therefore, the patient is afforded the option to use either functional strategy.\n\n【1】 The German phycisist Burkhard Heim had two Krukenberg hands as a result of a laboratory accident.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-05-08 01:37:59", "update_time": "2024-05-08 22:15:00"}

Symptoms suggestive of angioedema or facial edema occurred in <0.5% of moexipril-treated patients in placebo-controlled trials. None of the cases were considered life-threatening and all resolved either without treatment or with medication (antihistamines or glucocorticoids). One patient treated with hydrochlorothiazide alone experienced laryngeal edema. No instances of angioedema were reported in placebo-treated patients.\n- In cases of angioedema, treatment should be promptly discontinued and the patient carefully observed until the swelling disappears. In instances where swelling has been confined to the face and lips, the condition has generally resolved without treatment, although antihistamines have been useful in relieving symptoms.\n- Angioedema associated with involvement of the tongue, glottis, or larynx, may be fatal due to airway obstruction. Appropriate therapy, e.g. subcutaneous epinephrine solution 1:1000 (0.3 to 0.5 mL) and/or measures to ensure a patent airway, should be promptly provided.\n\n【2】 ### Anaphylactoid Reactions During Desensitization\n- Two patients undergoing desensitizing treatment with hymenoptera venom while receiving ACE inhibitors sustained life-threatening anaphylactoid reactions. In the same patients, these reactions did not occur when ACE inhibitors were temporarily withheld, but they reappeared when the ACE inhibitors were inadvertently readministered.\n\n【3】 ### Anaphylactoid Reactions During Membrane Exposure\n- Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported in patients dialyzed with high-flux membranes and treated concomitantly with an ACE inhibitor. Anaphylactoid reactions have also been reported in patients undergoing low-density lipoprotein apheresis with dextran sulfate absorption.\n\n【4】 ### Hypotension\n- Moexipril hydrochloride can cause symptomatic hypotension, although, as with other ACE inhibitors, this is unusual in uncomplicated hypertensive patients treated with moexipril hydrochloride alone. Symptomatic hypotension was seen in 0.5% of patients given moexipril and led to discontinuation of therapy in about 0.25%. Symptomatic hypotension is most likely to occur in patients who have been salt- and volume-depleted as a result of prolonged diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, dialysis, diarrhea, or vomiting. Volume- and salt-depletion should be corrected and, in general, diuretics stopped, before initiating therapy with moexipril hydrochloride.\n- If hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in a supine position and, if necessary, treated with an intravenous infusion of normal saline. Moexipril hydrochloride treatment usually can be continued following restoration of blood pressure and volume.\n\n【5】 ### Pregnancy category D\n- Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the secondand third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations.  Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death.  When pregnancy is detected, discontinue moexipril hydrochloride as soon as possible. These adverse outcomes are usually associated with use of these drugs in the second and third trimester of pregnancy.  Most epidemiologic studies examining fetal abnormalities after exposure to antihypertensive use in the first trimester have not distinguished drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system from other antihypertensive agents.  Appropriate management of maternal hypertension during pregnancy is important to optimize outcomes for both mother and fetus.\n- In the unusual case that there is no appropriate alternative to therapy with drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system for a particular patient, apprise the mother of the potential risk to the fetus.  Perform serial ultrasound examinations to assess the intra-amniotic environment.\n- If oligohydramnios is observed, discontinue  moexipril hydrochloride  unless it is considered lifesaving for the mother.  Fetal testing may be appropriate, based on the week of pregnancy. Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury.  Closely observe Infants with histories of in utero exposure to Moexipril hydrochloride  for hypotension, oliguria, and hyperkalemia - No embryotoxic, fetotoxic, or teratogenic effects were seen in rats or in rabbits treated with up to 90.9 and 0.7 times, respectively, the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) on a mg/m2 basis.\n\n【6】 ### Hepatic Failure\n- Rarely, ACE inhibitors have been associated with a syndrome that starts with cholestatic jaundice and progresses to fulminant hepatic necrosis and sometimes death. The mechanism of this syndrome is not understood. Patients receiving ACE inhibitors who develop jaundice or marked elevations of hepatic enzymes should discontinue the ACE inhibitor and receive appropriate medical follow-up.\n\n【7】 ### Impaired Renal Function\n- As a consequence of inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals. There is no clinical experience of moexipril hydrochloride in the treatment of hypertension in patients with renal failure.\n- Some hypertensive patients with no apparent preexisting renal vascular disease have developed increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine, usually minor and transient, especially when moexipril hydrochloride has been given concomitantly with a thiazide diuretic. This is more likely to occur in patients with preexisting renal impairment. There may be a need for dose adjustment of moexipril hydrochloride and/or the discontinuation of the thiazide diuretic.\n- Evaluation of hypertensive patients should always include assessment of renal function.\n\n【8】 ### Hypertensive Patients With Congestive Heart Failure\n- In hypertensive patients with severe congestive heart failure, whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, treatment with ACE inhibitors, including moexipril hydrochloride, may be associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and, rarely, acute renal failure and/or death.\n\n【9】 ### Cough\n- Presumably due to the inhibition of the degradation of endogenous bradykinin, persistent nonproductive cough has been reported with all ACE inhibitors, always resolving after discontinuation of therapy. ACE inhibitor-induced cough should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cough. In controlled trials with moexipril, cough was present in 6.1% of moexipril patients and 2.2% of patients given placebo.\n- Reported adverse experiences were usually mild and transient, and there were no differences in adverse reaction rates related to gender, race, age, duration of therapy, or total daily dosage within the range of 3.75 mg to 60 mg. Discontinuation of therapy because of adverse experiences was required in 3.4% of patients treated with moexipril hydrochloride and in 1.8% of patients treated with placebo. The most common reasons for discontinuation in patients treated with moexipril hydrochloride were cough (0.7%) and dizziness (0.4%).\n\n【10】 - Other adverse events occurring in more than 1% of patients on moexipril that were at least as frequent on placebo include: headache, upper respiratory infection, pain, rhinitis, dyspepsia, nausea, peripheral edema, sinusitis, chest pain, and urinary frequency. Angioedema, hypotension, neutropenia/agranulocytosis, second and third trimester fetal/neonatal morbidity and mortality, hyperkalemia, and cough.\n- Other potentially important adverse experiences reported in controlled or uncontrolled clinical trials in less than 1% of moexipril patients or that have been attributed to other ACE inhibitors include the following:\n\n【11】 ### Cardiovascular\n- Symptomatic hypotension, postural hypotension, or syncope were seen in 9/1750 (0.51%) patients; these reactions led to discontinuation of therapy in controlled trials in 3/1254 (0.24%) patients who had received moexipril hydrochloride monotherapy and in 1/344 (0.3%) patients who had received moexipril hydrochloride with hydrochlorothiazide. Other adverse events included angina/myocardial infarction, palpitations, rhythm disturbances, and cerebrovascular accident.\n\n【12】 ### Renal\n- Of hypertensive patients with no apparent preexisting renal disease, 1% of patients receiving moexipril hydrochloride alone and 2% of patients receiving moexipril hydrochloride with hydrochlorothiazide experienced increases in serum creatinine to at least 140% of their baseline values.\n\n【13】 ### Gastrointestinal\n- Abdominal pain, constipation, vomiting, appetite/weight change, dry mouth, pancreatitis, hepatitis.\n\n【14】 ### Respiratory\n- Bronchospasm, dyspnea, eosinophilic pneumonitis.\n\n【15】 ### Urogenital\n- Renal insufficiency, oliguria.\n\n【16】 ### Dermatologic\n- Apparent hypersensitivity reactions manifested by urticaria, rash, pemphigus, pruritus, photosensitivity, alopecia.\n\n【17】 ### Neurological and Psychiatric\n- Drowsiness, sleep disturbances, nervousness, mood changes, anxiety.\n\n【18】 ### Other\n- Angioedema , taste disturbances, tinnitus, sweating, malaise, arthralgia, hemolytic anemia.\n\n【19】 ### Serum Electrolytes\nHyperkalemia , hyponatremia.\n\n【20】 ### Creatinine and Blood Urea Nitrogen\n- As with other ACE inhibitors, minor increases in blood urea nitrogen or serum creatinine, reversible upon discontinuation of therapy, were observed in approximately 1% of patients with essential hypertension who were treated with moexipril hydrochloride. Increases are more likely to occur in patients receiving concomitant diuretics and in patients with compromised renal function.\n\n【21】 ### Other\n- Clinically important changes in standard laboratory tests were rarely associated with moexipril hydrochloride administration.\n- Elevations of liver enzymes and uric acid have been reported. In trials, less than 1% of moexipril-treated patients discontinued moexipril hydrochloride treatment because of laboratory abnormalities. The incidence of abnormal laboratory values with moexipril was similar to that in the placebo-treated group.\n\n【22】 ### Potassium Supplements and Potassium-Sparing Diuretics\n- Moexipril hydrochloride can increase serum potassium because it decreases aldosterone secretion. Use of potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone, triamterene, amiloride) or potassium supplements concomitantly with ACE inhibitors can increase the risk of hyperkalemia. Therefore, if concomitant use of such agents is indicated, they should be given with caution and the patient's serum potassium should be monitored.\n\n【23】 ### Oral Anticoagulants\n- Interaction studies with warfarin failed to identify any clinically important effect on the serum concentrations of the anticoagulant or on its anticoagulant effect.\n\n【24】 ### Lithium\n- Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving ACE inhibitors during therapy with lithium. These drugs should be coadministered with caution, and frequent monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended. If a diuretic is also used, the risk of lithium toxicity may be increased.\n\n【25】 ### Gold\n- Nitritoid reactions (symptoms include facial flushing, nausea, vomiting and hypotension) have been reported rarely in patients on therapy with injectable gold (sodium aurothiomalate) and concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy including moexipril hydrochloride.\n\n【26】 ### Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors)\n- In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDS, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with ACE inhibitors, including moexipril, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure.  These effects are usually reversible.  Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving moexipril and NSAID therapy.The antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors, including moexipril hydrochloride, may be attenuated by NSAIDS.\n\n【27】 ### Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS)\n- Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on moexipril hydrochloride and other agents that affect the RAS.\n- Do not co-administer aliskiren with moexipril in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with moexipril hydrochloride in patients with renal impairment (GFR <60 mL/min).\n\n【28】 ### Other Agents\n- No clinically important pharmacokinetic interactions occurred when moexipril hydrochloride was administered concomitantly with hydrochlorothiazide, digoxin, or cimetidine.\n- Moexipril hydrochloride has been used in clinical trials concomitantly with calcium-channel-blocking agents, diuretics, H2 blockers, digoxin, oral hypoglycemic agents, and cholesterol-lowering agents. There was no evidence of clinically important adverse interactions.\n\n【29】 - No evidence of carcinogenicity was detected in long-term studies in mice and rats at doses up to 14 or 27.3 times the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) on a mg/m2 basis.\n- No mutagenicity was detected in the Ames test and microbial reverse mutation assay, with and without metabolic activation, or in an in vivo nucleus anomaly test. However, increased chromosomal aberration frequency in Chinese hamster ovary cells was detected under metabolic activation conditions at a 20-hour harvest time.\n- Reproduction studies have been performed in rabbits at oral doses up to 0.7 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis, and in rats up to 90.9 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis. No indication of impaired fertility, reproductive toxicity, or teratogenicity was observed.\n- In the unusual case that there is no appropriate alternative to therapy with drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system for a particular patient, apprise the mother of the potential risk to the fetus.  Perform serial ultrasound examinations to assess the intra-amniotic environment.\n- If oligohydramnios is observed, discontinue  moexipril hydrochloride  unless it is considered lifesaving for the mother.  Fetal testing may be appropriate, based on the week of pregnancy. Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury.  Closely observe Infants with histories of in utero exposure to Moexipril hydrochloride  for hypotension, oliguria, and hyperkalemia - Safety and effectiveness of moexipril hydrochloride in pediatric patients have not been established.\n- In elderly male subjects (65 to 80 years old) with clinically normal renal and hepatic function, the AUC and Cmax of moexiprilat is about 30% greater than those of younger subjects (19 to 42 years old).\n- The effective elimination t ½ and AUC of both moexipril and moexiprilat are increased with decreasing renal function. There is insufficient information available to characterize this relationship fully, but at creatinine clearances in the range of 10 to 40 mL/min, the t ½ of moexiprilat is increased by a factor of 3 to\n- The recommended initial dose of moexipril hydrochloride in patients not receiving diuretics is 7.5 mg, one hour prior to meals, once daily. Dosage should be adjusted according to blood pressure response. The antihypertensive effect of moexipril hydrochloride may diminish towards the end of the dosing interval. Blood pressure should, therefore, be measured just prior to dosing to determine whether satisfactory blood pressure control is obtained. If control is not adequate, increased dose or divided dosing can be tried. The recommended dose range is 7.5 to 30 mg daily, administered in one or two divided doses one hour before meals. Total daily doses above 60 mg a day have not been studied in hypertensive patients.\n\n【30】 ### Dosage Adjustment in Renal Impairment\n- For patients with a creatinine clearance ≤40 mL/min/1.73 m2, an initial dose of 3.75 mg once daily should be given cautiously. Doses may be titrated upward to a maximum daily dose of 15 mg.\n- Another ACE inhibitor, captopril, has been shown to cause agranulocytosis and bone marrow depression, rarely in patients with uncomplicated hypertension, but more frequently in hypertensive patients with renal impairment, especially if they also have a collagen-vascular disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus or scleroderma. Although there were no instances of severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count <500/mm3) among patients given moexipril hydrochloride, as with other ACE inhibitors, monitoring of white blood cell counts should be considered for patients who have collagen-vascular disease, especially if the disease is associated with impaired renal function. Available data from clinical trials of moexipril hydrochloride are insufficient to show that moexipril hydrochloride does not cause agranulocytosis at rates similar to captopril.\n\n【31】 ### Monitor Potassium with Diuretics\n- Moexipril hydrochloride can increase serum potassium because it decreases aldosterone secretion. Use of potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone, triamterene, amiloride) or potassium supplements concomitantly with ACE inhibitors can increase the risk of hyperkalemia. Therefore, if concomitant use of such agents is indicated, they should be given with caution and the patient's serum potassium should be monitored.\n\n【32】 ### Monitor serum Lithium\n- Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving ACE inhibitors during therapy with lithium. These drugs should be coadministered with caution, and frequent monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended. If a diuretic is also used, the risk of lithium toxicity may be increased.\n\n【33】 ### Monitor renal function in Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents\n- In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDS, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with ACE inhibitors, including moexipril, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure.  These effects are usually reversible.  Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving moexipril and NSAID therapy.The antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors, including moexipril hydrochloride, may be attenuated by NSAIDS.\n\n【34】 ### Monitor Blood Pressue with Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS)\n- Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on moexipril hydrochloride and other agents that affect the RAS.\n- No data are available to suggest that physiological maneuvers (e.g. maneuvers to change the pH of the urine) would accelerate elimination of moexipril and its metabolites. The dialyzability of moexipril is not known.\n- Angiotensin II could presumably serve as a specific antagonist-antidote in the setting of moexipril overdose, but angiotensin II is essentially unavailable outside of research facilities. Because the hypotensive effect of moexipril is achieved through vasodilation and effective hypovolemia, it is reasonable to treat moexipril overdose by infusion of normal saline solution. In addition, renal function and serum potassium should be monitored\n- Whether increased levels of bradykinin, a potent vasodepressor peptide, play a role in the therapeutic effects of moexipril remains to be elucidated. Although the principal mechanism of moexipril in blood pressure reduction is believed to be through the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, ACE inhibitors have some effect on blood pressure even in apparent low-renin hypertension. As is the case with other ACE inhibitors, however, the antihypertensive effect of moexipril is considerably smaller in black patients, a predominantly low-renin population, than in non-black hypertensive patients.\nMoexipril hydrochloride is a fine white to off-white powder. It is soluble (about 10% weight-to-volume) in distilled water at room temperature.\nunivasc is supplied as scored, coated tablets containing 7.5 mg and 15 mg of moexipril hydrochloride for oral administration. In addition to the active ingredient, moexipril hydrochloride, the tablet core contains the following inactive ingredients: lactose, magnesium oxide, crospovidone, magnesium stearate and gelatin. The film coating contains hydroxypropyl cellulose, hypromellose, polyethylene glycol 6000, magnesium stearate, titanium dioxide, and ferric oxide.\n\n【35】 ### Absorption\n- Moexipril is incompletely absorbed, with bioavailability as moexiprilat of about 13%. Bioavailability varies with formulation and food intake which reduces C max and AUC by about 70% and 40% respectively after the ingestion of a low-fat breakfast or by 80% and 50% respectively after the ingestion of a high-fat breakfast.\n\n【36】 ### Distribution\n- The clearance (CL) for moexipril is 441 mL/min and for moexiprilat 232 mL/min with a t ½ of 1.3 and 9.8 hours, respectively. Moexiprilat is about 50% protein bound. The volume of distribution of moexiprilat is about 183 liters.\n\n【37】 ### Metabolism and Excretion\n- Moexipril is relatively rapidly converted to its active metabolite moexiprilat, but persists longer than some other ACE inhibitor prodrugs, such that its t ½ is over one hour and it has a significant AUC. Both moexipril and moexiprilat are converted to diketopiperazine derivatives and unidentified metabolites. After I.V. administration of moexipril, about 40% of the dose appears in urine as moexiprilat, about 26% as moexipril, with small amounts of the metabolites; about 20% of the I.V. dose appears in feces, principally as moexiprilat. After oral administration, only about 7% of the dose appears in urine as moexiprilat, about 1% as moexipril, with about 5% as other metabolites. Fifty-two percent of the dose is recovered in feces as moexiprilat and 1% as moexipril.\n\n【38】 ### Pharmacokinetic Interactions With Other Drugs\n- No clinically important pharmacokinetic interactions occurred when moexipril hydrochloride was administered concomitantly with hydrochlorothiazide, digoxin, or cimetidine.\n- No evidence of carcinogenicity was detected in long-term studies in mice and rats at doses up to 14 or 27.3 times the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) on a mg/m2 basis.\n- No mutagenicity was detected in the Ames test and microbial reverse mutation assay, with and without metabolic activation, or in an in vivo nucleus anomaly test. However, increased chromosomal aberration frequency in Chinese hamster ovary cells was detected under metabolic activation conditions at a 20-hour harvest time.\n- Reproduction studies have been performed in rabbits at oral doses up to 0.7 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis, and in rats up to 90.9 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis. No indication of impaired fertility, reproductive toxicity, or teratogenicity was observed.\n- In multiple dose studies in the dose range of 7.5 to 30 mg once daily, moexipril hydrochloride lowered sitting diastolic and systolic blood pressure effects at trough by 3 to 6 mmHg and 4 to 11 mmHg more than placebo, respectively. There was a tendency toward increased response with higher doses over this range. These effects are typical of ACE inhibitors but, to date, there are no trials of adequate size comparing moexipril with other antihypertensive agents.\n- During chronic therapy, the antihypertensive effect of any dose of moexipril hydrochloride is generally evident within 2 weeks of treatment, with maximal reduction after 4 weeks.\n- The antihypertensive effects of moexipril hydrochloride have been proven to continue during therapy for up to 24 months.\n- Moexipril hydrochloride, like other ACE inhibitors, is less effective in decreasing trough blood pressures in blacks than in non-blacks. Placebo-corrected trough group mean diastolic blood pressure effects in blacks in the proposed dose range varied between +1 to -3 mmHg compared with responses in non-blacks of -4 to -6 mmHg.\n- The effectiveness of moexipril hydrochloride was not significantly influenced by patient age, gender, or weight. Moexipril hydrochloride has been shown to have antihypertensive activity in both pre- and postmenopausal women who have participated in placebo-controlled clinical trials.\nunivasc (moexipril hydrochloride) 15 mg tablets are salmon colored, biconvex, film-coated, and scored with engraved code 715 on the unscored side and SP above and 15 below the score. They are supplied as follows:\n- Dispense in a tight, light-resistant container .  Protect from excessive moisture.\n- Patients should be advised to take moexipril one hour before meals .\n- Angioedema - Angioedema, including laryngeal edema, may occur with treatment with ACE inhibitors, usually occurring early in therapy (within the first month). Patients should be so advised and told to report immediately any signs or symptoms suggesting angioedema (swelling of the face, extremities, eyes, lips, tongue, difficulty in breathing) and to take no more univasc until they have consulted with the prescribing physician.\n- Symptomatic Hypotension\n- Patients should be cautioned that lightheadedness can occur with univasc, especially during the first few days of therapy. If fainting occurs, the patient should stop taking univasc and consult the prescribing physician.\nAll patients should be cautioned that excessive perspiration and dehydration may lead to an excessive fall in blood pressure because of reduction in fluid volume. Other causes of volume depletion such as vomiting or diarrhea may also lead to a fall in blood pressure; patients should be advised to consult their physician if they develop these conditions.\n- Hyperkalemia - Neutropenia - Pregnancy\n- Female patients of childbearing age should be told about the consequences of exposure to univasc during pregnancy. Discuss treatment options with women planning to become pregnant. Patients should be asked to report pregnancies to their physicians as soon as possible.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": "语义不完整#10#10# include the following:后面缺少内容", "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-05-08 01:37:59", "update_time": "2024-05-08 19:16:00"}

In practice \"quantifiable behavior\" is often constituted by \"task performance\".\nAs quantification of behavior is fundamental in this endeavor, the theory of measurement is a central topic in mathematical psychology.\nMathematical psychology is therefore closely related to psychometrics. However, where psychometrics is concerned with individual differences (or population structure) in mostly static variables, mathematical psychology focuses on process models of perceptual, cognitive and motor processes as inferred from the 'average individual'. Furthermore, where psychometrics investigates the stochastic dependence structure between variables as observed in the population, mathematical psychology almost exclusively focuses on the modeling of data obtained from experimental paradigms and is therefore even more closely related to experimental psychology/cognitive psychology/psychonomics.  Like computational neuroscience and econometrics, mathematical psychology theory often uses statistical optimality as a guiding principle, apparently assuming that the human brain has evolved to solve problems in an optimized way. Central themes from cognitive psychology—limited vs. unlimited processing capacity, serial vs. parallel processing, etc.—and their implications, are central in rigorous analysis in mathematical psychology.\n\n【1】 #History\n\n【2】 The establishment of the first psychological laboratory in Germany by Wundt, who amply used Donders' ideas, and the failure of Wundt's method of introspection led to the rise of different schools of thought. Wundt's laboratory was directed towards conscious human experience, in line with the work of Fechner and Weber on the intensity of stimuli. Part of the problems was due to the individual differences in response speed found by astronomers. Wundt's American student James McKeen Catell was fascinated by these differences, although Wundt did not seem to take interest and kept his focus on the study of the general human mind. In the United Kingdom, under the influence of the anthropometric developments led by Francis Galton, interest arose in individual differences between humans on psychological variables in line with the work of Bessel. Catell soon adopted the methods of Galton and helped laying the  foundation of psychometrics. In the United States, behaviorism arose in despise of introspectionism and associated reaction time research, and turned the focus of psychological research entirely to learning theory. Behaviorism dominated American psychology until then end of the Second World War. In Europe introspection survived in Gestalt psychology. Behaviorism largely refrained from inference on mental processes, and formal theories were mostly absent ,except for vision and audition. During the war, developments in engineering, mathematical logic and computability theory, computer science and mathematics, and the military need to understand human performance and limitations, brought together experimental psychologist, mathematicians, engineers, physicists, and economists. Out of this mix of  different disciplines mathematical psychology arose. Especially the developments in signal processing, information theory, linear systems and filter theory, game theory, stochastic processes and mathematical logic gained a large influence on psychological thinking.\nTwo seminal papers on learning theory in Psychological Review, helped establishing the field in a world that was still dominated by behaviorists: A paper by Bush and Mosteller instigated the linear operator approach to learning, and a paper by Estes that started the stimulus sampling tradition in psychological theorizing\n\n【3】 Under the influence of developments in computer science, logic, and language theory, in the 1960s modeling became more in terms of computational mechanisms and devices. Examples of the latter constitute so called cognitive architectures (e.g. production rule systems, ACT-R) as well connectionist systems or neural networks.\n\n【4】 #Influential Mathematical Psychologists\n- Richard C.

They love to examine complicated systems.\n- Auxiliary Extroverted Sensing-This function gives the ISTP an element of spontaneity, embracing chances to plunge headfirst into experiences. It also gives them a keen insight into situations similar to that of the ISTJ. Their occasionally tunnelvisioned curiosity for the world around them gives them a \"leap before you look\" tendency. They are notorious for taking apart devices to \"see what makes them tick\", before consideration as to whether they can put them back together.\n- Tertiary Introverted iNtuition-Never as open in their theorizing as the INTP, the ISTP prefers to keep themselves grounded in the situation at hand, using their intuition to visualize components and concepts that they cannot see and touch firsthand, such as the wiring in a circuit board.\n- inferior Extroverted Feeling- The weak point of the ISTP, they may interpret criticisms of their ideas as criticisms of their competence.

Common adverse reactions include diarrhea, nausea, backache, headache, fever.\n\n【2】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Adult)\n- Dinoprostone is indicated for the initiation and/or continuation of cervical ripening in patients at or near term in whom there is a medical or obstetrical indication for the induction of labor.\n- The dosage of dinoprostone in the vaginal insert is 10 mg designed to be released at approximately 0.3 mg/hour over a 12 hour period. Cervidil should be removed upon onset of active labor or 12 hours after insertion.\n- Dinoprostone is supplied in an individually wrapped aluminium/polyethylene package with a \"tear mark\" on one side of the package. The package should only be opened by tearing the aluminium package along the tear mark. The package should never be opened with scissors or other sharp objects which may compromise or cut the knitted polyester pouch that serves as the retrieval system for the polymeric slab.\n- Dinoprostone must be kept frozen until use, and is administered by placing one unit transversely in the posterior fornix of the vagina immediately after removal from its foil package. The insertion of the vaginal insert does not require sterile conditions. The vaginal insert must not be used without its retrieval system. There is no need for previous warming of the product. A minimal amount of water-miscible lubricant may be used to assist insertion of dinoprostone. Care should be taken not to permit excess contact or coating with the lubricant which could prevent optimal swelling and release of dinoprostone from the vaginal insert. Patients should remain in the recumbent position for 2 hours following insertion, but thereafter may be ambulatory. If the patient is ambulatory, care should be taken to ensure the vaginal insert remains in place. If uterine hyperstimulation is encountered or if labor commences, the vaginal insert should be removed. Dinoprostone should also be removed prior to amniotomy.\n\n【3】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Dinoprostone in adult patients.\n\n【4】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n- Induction of labor.\n\n【5】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Pediatric)\nThere is limited information regarding FDA-Labeled Use of Dinoprostone in pediatric patients.\n\n【6】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Dinoprostone in pediatric patients.\n\n【7】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Dinoprostone in pediatric patients.\n\n【8】 #Contraindications\n- Dinoprostone is contraindicated in:\n- Patients with known hypersensitivity to prostaglandins.\n- Patients in whom there is clinical suspicion or definite evidence of fetal distress where delivery is not imminent.\n- Patients already receiving intravenous oxytocic drugs.\n- Multipara with 6 or more previous term pregnancies.\n\n【9】 - For hospital use only\n- Dinoprostone should be administered only by trained obstetrical personnel in a hospital setting with appropriate obstetrical care facilities.\n- Women aged 30 years or older, those with complications during pregnancy and those with a gestational age over 40 weeks have been shown to have an increased risk of postpartum disseminated intravascular coagulation. In addition, these factors may further increase the risk associated with labor induction.\n- Therefore, in these women, use of dinoprostone should be undertaken with caution. Measures should be applied to detect as soon as possible an evolving fibrinolysisin the immediate post-partum period.\n\n【10】 ## Clinical Trials Experience\n- Dinoprostone is well tolerated. In placebo-controlled trials in which 658 women were entered and 320 received active therapy (218 without retrieval system, 102 with retrieval system), the following events were reported.\n- Drug related fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain were noted in less than 1% of patients who received dinoprostone.\n- In study 101-801 (with the retrieval system) cases of hyperstimulation reversed within 2 to 13 minutes of removal of the product. Tocolytics were required in one of the five cases.\n- In cases of fetal distress, when product removal was thought advisable there was a return to normal rhythm and no neonatal sequelae.\n- Five minute Apgar scores were 7 or above in 98.2% (646/658) of studied neonates whose mothers received dinoprostone. In a report of a 3 year pediatric follow-up study in 121 infants, 51 of whose mothers received dinoprostone, there were no deleterious effects on physical examination or psychomotor evaluation.\n- Immune System Disorders\n- Hypersensitivity.\n- Blood and lymphatic system disorders.\n- Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation.\n- Reproductive system\n- Reports of uterine rupture have been reported in association with use of dinoprostone some required a hysterectomy and some resulted in subsequent fetal or neonatal death.\n- Vascular Disorders\n- Hypotension\n\n【11】 - Amniotic fluid embolism\n\n【12】 ## Postmarketing Experience\nThere iimited information regarding Postmarketing Experience of Dinoprostone in the drug label.\n\n【13】 #Drug Interactions\nThere is limited information regarding Dinoprostone Drug Interactions in the drug label.\n\n【14】 ### Pregnancy\nPregnancy Category (FDA): C\n- Prostaglandin E2 has produced an increase in skeletal anomalies in rats and rabbits.

Although safety and efficacy has not been established in pediatric patients, safety and efficacy are expected to be the same for adolescents.\n\n【18】 ### Geriatic Use\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Dinoprostone with respect to geriatric patients.\n\n【19】 ### Gender\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Dinoprostone with respect to specific gender populations.\n\n【20】 ### Race\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Dinoprostone with respect to specific racial populations.\n\n【21】 ### Renal Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Dinoprostone in patients with renal impairment.\n\n【22】 ### Hepatic Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Dinoprostone in patients with hepatic impairment.\n\n【23】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Dinoprostone in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n\n【24】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\nThere is no FDA guidance one the use of Dinoprostone in patients who are immunocompromised.\n\n【25】 ### Administration\n- Oral\n- Intravenous\n\n【26】 ### Monitoring\nThere is limited information regarding Monitoring of Dinoprostone in the drug label.\n- Description\n\n【27】 #IV Compatibility\nThere is limited information regarding IV Compatibility of Dinoprostone in the drug label.\n\n【28】 #Overdosage\n- dinoprostone is used as a single dosage in a single application. Overdosage is usually manifested by uterine hyperstimulation which may be accompanied by fetal distress, and is usually responsive to removal of the insert. Other treatment must be symptomatic since, to date, clinical experience with prostaglandin antagonists is insufficient.\n- The use of beta-adrenergic agents should be considered in the event of undesirable increased uterine activity.\n\n【29】 #Pharmacology\nThere is limited information regarding Dinoprostone Pharmacology in the drug label.\n\n【30】 ## Structure\n- Dinoprostone vaginal insert is a thin, flat, polymeric slab which is rectangular in shape with rounded corners contained within the pouch of an off-white knitted polyester retrieval system. Each slab is buff colored, semitransparent and contains 10 mg of dinoprostone in a hydrogel insert. An integral part of the knitted polyester retrieval system is a long tape designed to aid retrieval at the end of the dosing interval or earlier if clinically indicated. The finished product is a controlled release formulation which has been found to release dinoprostone in vivo at a rate of approximately 0.3 mg/hr.\n- The chemical name for dinoprostone (commonly known as prostaglandin E2 or PGE2) is 11α, 15S-dihydroxy-9-oxo-prosta-5Z,13E-dien-1-oic acid and the structural formula is represented below:\n\n【31】 ## Pharmacodynamics\nThere is limited information regarding Pharmacodynamics of Dinoprostone in the drug label.\n\n【32】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n- Dinoprostone (PGE2) is a naturally-occurring biomolecule. It is found in low concentrations in most tissues of the body and functions as a local hormone . As with any local hormone, it is very rapidly metabolized in the tissues of synthesis (the half-life estimated to be 2.5-5 minutes). The rate limiting step for inactivation is regulated by the enzyme 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (PGDH) .\n- In pregnancy, PGE2 is secreted continuously by the fetal membranes and placenta and plays an important role in the final events leading to the initiation of labor , as two separate processes.\n- PGE2 plays an important role in the complex set of biochemical and structural alterations involved in cervical ripening. Cervical ripening involves a marked relaxation of the cervical smooth muscle fibers of the uterine cervix which must be transformed from a rigid structure to a softened, yielding and dilated configuration to allow passage of the fetus through the birth canal . This process involves activation of the enzyme collagenase which is responsible for digestion of some of the structural collagen network of the cervix .\n- No correlation could be established between PGE2 release and plasma concentrations of PGEm. The relative contributions of endogenously and exogenously released PGE2 to the plasma levels of the metabolite PGEm could not be determined. Moreover, it is uncertain as to whether the measured concentrations of PGEm reflect the natural progression of PGEm concentrations in blood as birth approaches or to what extent the measured concentrations following PGE2 administration represent an increase over basal levels that might be measured in control patients.\n\n【33】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\nThere is limited information regarding Nonclinical Toxicology of Dinoprostone in the drug label.\n\n【34】 #How Supplied\nThe product is wound and enclosed in an aluminium/polyethylene pack.\n\n【35】 ## Storage\n- Store in a freezer: between -20°C and -10°C (-4°F and 14°F). Cervidil is packed in foil and is stable when stored in a freezer for a period of three years. Vaginal inserts exposed to high humidity will absorb moisture from the air and thereby alter the release characteristics of dinoprostone. Once used, the vaginal insert should be discarded.\n\n【36】 #Patient Counseling Information\nThere is limited information regarding Patient Counseling Information of Dinoprostone in the drug label.\n\n【37】 #Precautions with Alcohol\n- Alcohol-Dinoprostone interaction has not been established.

However, there are sufficient differences in human and animal models to indicate this is only a theory at the present time.\nChildren with antibodies treated with vitamin B-3 (niacin) had less than half the onset of diabetes incidence in a 7-year time span as the general population and even lower incidence relative to those with antibodies as above, but no vitamin B", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-05-08 01:37:59", "update_time": "2024-05-08 22:02:19"}

Several studies noted consistency between metastatic cancer of unknown primary and metastases with known primary origins based on chromosomal abnormalities and over expression of several genes.\n\n【5】 #Causes\nSeveral studies have evaluated the chromosomal and molecular anomalies found in cancers of unknown primary; however, they could not identify unique causes of metastasis of unknown primaries relative to those with known primary origins.\n\n【6】 #Differential Diagnosis\nCancer of unknown primary is a diagnosis of exclusion; hence, all other differentials in addition to primary tumor location must be ruled out prior to diagnosis.\n\n【7】 #Epidemiology and Demographics\nThe prevalence of cancer of unknown primary origin is approximately 10 cases per 100,000 individuals worldwide. Patients of all age groups may develop cancer of unknown primary origin. In most cases cancer of unknown primary origin affects men and women equally. There is no racial predilection to cancer of unknown primary origin.\n\n【8】 #Risk Factors\nThere are no established risk factors specific for cancer of unknown primary origin.\n\n【9】 #Screening\nThere is insufficient evidence to recommend routine screening for cancer of unknown primary origin.\n\n【10】 Early clinical features include fatigue, weight-loss, and loss of appetite. Common complications of cancer of unknown primary origin, may include: hypercalcemia, adrenal insufficiency, and inappropriate antidiuretic syndrome, hematologic disorders, and malignant effusions. Prognosis is generally poor, and the average survival time of patients with cancer of unknown primary origin is approximately 6-12 months after diagnosis.\n\n【11】 ## Diagnostic Study of Choice\nThe diagnosis of cancer of unknown primary origin is made when the following diagnostic criteria are met: tissue biopsy indicating malignancy and all known primary origins of cancer are ruled out. The initial approach may vary on a case-by-case basis; however, the diagnosis is made after histopathological and clinical testing.\n\n【12】 ## History and Symptoms\nThe majority of patients with cancer of unknown primary origin are asymptomatic.\n\n【13】 ## Physical Examination\nThere are no remarkable findings in the physical examination of CUP patients; the presentation is variable and depends on many factors including the primary tumor's origin and extent of organs involved.\n\n【14】 ## Laboratory Findings\n\n【15】 ## X-Ray\nA chest x-ray is a prerequisite in the diagnosis of cancer of unknown primary; however, its value is of less significance when it comes to locating the primary tumor or differentiating it from a metastatic lesion.\n\n【16】 ## Ultrasound\nThere are no specific echocardiography or ultrasound findings associated with cancer of unknown primary origin.

Hypoplasia of the heart is rare but is the most serious form of congenital heart defect; it is called hypoplastic left heart syndrome when it affects the left side of the heart and hypoplastic right heart syndrome when it affects the right side of the heart.  In both conditions, the presence of a patent ductus arteriosus (and, when hypoplasia affects the right side of the heart, a patent foramen ovale) is vital to the infant's ability to survive until emergency heart surgery can be performed, since without these pathways blood cannot circulate to the body (or lungs, depending on which side of the heart is defective).  Hypoplasia of the heart is generally a cyanotic heart defect.\nHypoplastic left heart syndrome is a rare congenital heart defect in which the left side of the heart is severely underdeveloped. In babies with HLHS, the aorta and left ventricle are very small, and the aortic and mitral valves are either too small to allow sufficient blood flow or are atretic (closed) altogether.  As blood returns from the lungs to the left atrium, it must pass through an atrial septal defect to the right side of the heart.\n\n【2】 #Pathophysiology\nIn patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, the left side of the heart is unable to send enough blood to the body. As a result, the right side of the heart must maintain the circulation for both the lungs and the body. The right ventricle can support the circulation to both the lungs and the body for a while, but this extra workload eventually causes the right side of the heart to fail.\n\n【3】 #Causes\nAs with most congenital heart defects, there is no known cause. Approximately 10% of patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome also have other birth defects.\n\n【4】 #Differentiating Hypoplastic left heart syndrome from other Diseases\nSigns and symptoms of hypoplastic left heart syndrome may be similar to other conditions. A differential diagnosis is essential to definitively diagnose hypoplastic left heart syndrome from associated conditions.\n\n【5】 #Risk Factors\nHypoplastic left heart is more common in males than in females.\n\n【6】 Failure to treat hypoplastic left heart syndrome can be fatal for the infant. However, with treatment, infants have a good chance at survival well into late adulthood. Potential complications may develop such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and even neurological complications.\n\n【7】 ## History and Symptoms\nAt first, a newborn with hypoplastic left heart may appear normal. Symptoms usually occur in the first few hours of life, although it may take up to a few days to develop symptoms. Common symptoms include cyanosis, dyspnea, and poor circulation.\n\n【8】 ## Physical Examination\nA physical examination is an integral part of diagnosing hypoplastic left heart syndrome. During a routine visit, a doctor may find signs of right ventricle enlargement, presence of additional birth defects, and hemodynamic imbalances.\n\n【9】 ## Laboratory Findings\nLaboratory studies that should be ordered include a complete blood count, and an arterial blood gas.\n\n【10】 ## Electocardiogram\nAn electrocardiogram should be ordered if hypoplastic left heart syndrome is suspected. Findings that may be depicted are right axis deviation, right ventricular hypertrophy, and prominent p waves.\n\n【11】 ## Chest X Ray\nFindings on chest x ray include increased markings of pulmonary vasculature, and cardiomegaly.\n\n【12】 ## Echocardiography\nThe echocardiogram is of high diagnostic value in the assessment of hypoplastic left heart syndrome. Doppler echocardiography will also help in visualizing the flow in the ventricles.\n\n【13】 ## Medical Therapy\nFailure to treat hypoplastic left heart syndrome can be fatal for the infant. Medical therapy can be used prior to surgical intervention to allow the ductus to open and promote bloodflow. It is only a temporary solution, surgical intervention is needed to ultimately repair hypoplastic left heart syndrome.\n\n【14】 ## Surgery\nFailure to treat hypoplastic left heart syndrome can be fatal for the infant. Surgical therapy is the only true way to treat and permanently fix hypoplastic left heart syndrome.

Paroxysmal AV block is defined as a delayed escape rhythm which repetitively blocks conduction from the atria to the ventricles, thereby causing syncope, conduction defects such as asystole and sudden cardiac death. It may or may not be associated with Phase 3 or Phase 4 conduction defects. It may be due to an increased vagal tone, innately low adenosine levels or an intrinsic conduction defect, all of which lead to different ECG presentations. Insufficient data is available regarding the exact etiology, diagnostic study of choice and treatment of paroxysmal AV blocks. It can be thought of more as a disease of exclusion. However,efforts must be made to have a standardized approach to such patients. The site of block may be clinically important and can be determined by invasive EPS when not apparent from the ECG and clinical circumstances. In general, atrioventricular block at the atrioventricular nodal level is associated with slower progression, a faster and more reliable atrioventricular junctional escape mechanism, and greater responsiveness to autonomic manipulation such as atropine, isoproterenol, and epinephrine administration. In contrast, atrioventricular block within or below the His bundle may progress rapidly and unexpectedly, is associated with a slower and more unpredictable ventricular escape mechanism, will not respond to atropine but will sometimes improve with catecholamines.\n\n【2】 #Historical Perspective\nOne of the first reported cases of paroxysmal AV block was secondary to mitral valvulitis, indicating an intrinsic conduction defect. A similar block was later seen in the Bundle of His, wherein during a hypothesized zone of opportunity, a spontaneous depolarization of conducting fibres was seen. Idiopathic paroxysmal AV block may be diagnosed by a positive response to adenosine triphosphate.\n\n【3】 #Classification\n\n【4】 #Pathophysiology\nIntrinsic paroxysmal AV block (I-AVB) is an AV block secondary to an innate anatomical defect. Given the presence of such a defect it's prognosis, compared to extrinsic paroxysmal vagal AV block and extrinsic paroxysmal idiopathic  AV block is poor. It may have a bradycardia or tachycardia component associated with it and is characterized by atrial/ventricular premature beats prior to the period of asystole. Extrinsic vagal paroxysmal AV Block occurs secondary to an increase in vagal tone. ECG findings reflecting this include sinus rate slowing and increasing PP interval/ PR interval prior to the period of asystole. Individuals with low levels of adenosine are susceptible to sudden surges in adenosine levels which act on the AV node and cause episodes of presyncope or syncope. This would be seen on an ECG as a sudden increase in sinus rate with narrow QRS complexes just prior to the period of asystole.\n\n【5】 #Causes\nIntrinsic conduction/ structural defects particularly those located in this intra His Bundle (intrinsic paroxysmal AV block), low adenosine levels (idiopathic paroxysmal AV block) and increase vagal tone/vagal surge (extrinsic vagal paroxysmal AV block) are the major causes of paroxysmal AV block. However, several reversible causes need to be ruled out before coming to a diagnosis.\n\n【6】 #Differentiating Paroxysmal AV Block from other Diseases\nConsidering that a number of conditions may present with a history of syncope and presyncope, paroxysmal AV block must treated as a diagnosis of exclusion. Vasaovagal syncope, situational syncope, carotid sinus hypersensitivity, seizures, structural heart defects such as aortic stenosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and conduction defects such as atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter are a few conditions that need to be ruled out initially.\n\n【7】 #Epidemiology and Demographics\nExact data reflecting the epidemiology of paroxysmal AV block is unavailable. However certain studies have shown an increased incidence in the elderly, no gender predisposition and an association with bundle branch blocks.\n\n【8】 #Risk Factors\nThere are no established risk factors for paroxysmal AV Block.\n\n【9】 #Screening\nThere is insufficient evidence to recommend routine screening for paroxysmal AV Block.\n\n【10】 Natural history most commonly includes recurrent unexplained syncope and presyncope. Complications such as sudden cardian death or indefinite periods of asystole may arise. Prognosis of intrinsic paroxysmal AV block is more dire than extrinsic idiopathic paroxysmal AV block or extrinsic vagal paroxysmal AV block.\n\n【11】 ## History and Symptoms\nThe majority of patients with paroxysmal AV Block present with presyncope, syncope, with or without a prodrome or are asymptomatic.\n\n【12】 ## Laboratory Findings\nAdenosine Plasma levels, adenosine triphosphate stimulation tests and lab values related to potential reversible causes of AV block such as a thyroid profile, electrolyte values,etc are important laboratory investigations.\n\n【13】 ## Electrocardiogram\nElectrocardiography is an important initial diagnostic test in diagnosing paroxysmal AV Block. Excercise ECG testing and ambulatory ECG monitoring may be employed.Intrinsic paroxysmal AV block is characterized by atrial premature beats/ventricular premature beats prior to and during the period of asystole. Extrinsic vagal paroxysmal AV block is characterized by sinus rate slowing, increasing PP interval/PR interval prior to the period or asystole. Extrinsic idiopathic paroxysmal AV block is characterized by narrowing of QRS complexes and sinus rate increase prior to the period of asystole.\n\n【14】 ## X-Ray\nThere are no x-ray findings associated with paroxysmal AV block.\n\n【15】 ## MRI\nMRI can be helpful in diagnosing infiltrative processes, including sarcoidosis, hemochromatosis, and amyloidosis.\n\n【16】 ## CT Scan\nCT offers superior information regarding calcification of cardiac structures and has some advantages in evaluating coronary artery anatomy when epicardial coronary atherosclerotic disease is suspected.\n\n【17】 ## Echocardiography\nEchocardiography has a highler yield where diagnosing syncope and presyncope is concerned, in patients with structural heart disease.\n\n【18】 ## Other Imaging Findings\nCardiac nuclear imaging techniques can be useful to detect and/or discriminate amongst infiltrative cardiomyopathies.\n\n【19】 ## Other Diagnostic Studies\nAn Implantable Cardiac Monitor is almost exclusively used in the diagnosis of bradycardia related disorders such as high-grade atrioventricular block, sinus node dysfunction and neurocardiogenic syncope (with predominant cardio-inhibitory component). This prolonged monitoring (up to 3 years) can help correlate bradycardia conduction disorders with symptoms. An EPS is an invasive catheter based procedure that is employed to detect and anatomically locate conduction disorders. An increased HH interval is seen in intrinsic paroxysmal AV Block. Certain maneuvers cause an increase in vagal surge and may precipitate symptoms in extrinsic vagal paroxysmal AV block.\n\n【20】 ## Medical Therapy\nIn patients with acute onset AV block,reversible causes such as drug toxicity,thyroid dysfunction, Lyme disease, etc should be taken into consideration. A decision should then be made regarding usage of  therapy or other treatment modalities such as temporary pacing. Theophylline is an adenosine antagonist that may be used in the diagnosis of extrinsic vagal paroxysmal AV Block.\n\n【21】 ## Interventions\nSeveral studies have demonstrated the efficacy of cardiac pacing in paroxysmal AV block. Temporary pacing should be used for the minimum duration necessary to prevent hemodynamic compromise and asystole. The presence or absence of symptoms and the correlation of those symptoms with a conduction defect is an important determinant of cardiac pacing. An improvement in conduction suggests that the level of the block is at the level of the AV node. Counterpressure maneuvers may be helpful in preventing vagally mediated syncope.\n\n【22】 ## Surgery\nSurgical intervention is not recommended for the management of paroxysmal AV Block.\n\n【23】 ## Primary Prevention\nThere are no established measures for the primary prevention of paroxysmal AV Block.\n\n【24】 ## Secondary Prevention\nThere are no established measures for the secondary prevention of paroxysmal AV Block.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-05-08 01:37:59", "update_time": "2024-05-08 19:53:19"}

Common adverse reactions include nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, fatigue, headache, fever, dizziness, chills, backache, tachycardia,hypersensitivity.\n\n【2】 ### Indications\n- Cerezyme (imiglucerase for injection) is indicated for long-term enzyme replacement therapy for pediatric and adult patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Type 1 Gaucher disease that results in one or more of the following conditions:\n- anemia - thrombocytopenia - bone disease\n- hepatomegaly or splenomegaly\n\n【3】 ### Dosage\n- Cerezyme (imiglucerase for injection) is administered by intravenous infusion over 1-2 hours. Dosage should be individualized to each patient. Initial dosages range from 2.5 U/kg of body weight 3 times a week to 60 U/kg once every 2 weeks.U/kg every 2 weeks is the dosage for which the most data are available. Disease severity may dictate that treatment be initiated at a relatively high dose or relatively frequent administration. Dosage adjustments should be made on an individual basis and may increase or decrease, based on achievement of therapeutic goals as assessed by routine comprehensive evaluations of the patient’s clinical manifestations.\n- On the day of use, after the correct amount of Cerezyme to be administered to the patient has been determined, the appropriate number of vials are each reconstituted with Sterile Water for Injection, USP.\n- A nominal 5.0 mL for the 200 unit vial (10.0 mL for the 400 unit vial) is withdrawn from each vial. The appropriate amount of Cerezyme for each patient is diluted with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, to a final volume of 100 – 200 mL. Cerezyme is administered by intravenous infusion over 1-2 hours. Aseptic techniques should be used when diluting the dose. Since Cerezyme does not contain any preservative, after reconstitution, vials should be promptly diluted and not stored for subsequent use. Cerezyme, after reconstitution, has been shown to be stable for up to 12 hours when stored at room temperature (25°C) and at 2-8°C. Cerezyme, when diluted, has been shown to be stable for up to 24 hours when stored at 2-8°C.\n- Relatively low toxicity, combined with the extended time course of response, allows small dosage adjustments to be made occasionally to avoid discarding partially used bottles. Thus, the dosage administered in individual infusions may be slightly increased or decreased to utilize fully each vial as long as the monthly administered dosage remains substantially unaltered.\n\n【4】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Imiglucerase in adult patients.\n\n【5】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Imiglucerase in adult patients.\n\n【6】 ### Indications\n- Cerezyme (imiglucerase for injection) is indicated for long-term enzyme replacement therapy for pediatric and adult patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Type 1 Gaucher disease that results in one or more of the following conditions:\n- anemia - thrombocytopenia - bone disease\n- hepatomegaly or splenomegaly\n\n【7】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Imiglucerase in pediatric patients.\n\n【8】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Imiglucerase in pediatric patients.\n\n【9】 #Contraindications\n- There are no known contraindications to the use of Cerezyme (imiglucerase for injection). Treatment with Cerezyme should be carefully re-evaluated if there is significant clinical evidence of hypersensitivity to the product.\n\n【10】 - Approximately 15% of patients treated and tested to date have developed IgG antibody to Cerezyme (imiglucerase for injection) during the first year of therapy. Patients who developed IgG antibody did so largely within 6 months of treatment and rarely developed antibodies to Cerezyme after 12 months of therapy. Approximately 46% of patients with detectable IgG antibodies experienced symptoms of hypersensitivity.\n- Patients with antibody to Cerezyme have a higher risk of hypersensitivity reaction. Conversely, not all patients with symptoms of hypersensitivity have detectable IgG antibody. It is suggested that patients be monitored periodically for IgG antibody formation during the first year of treatment.\n- Treatment with Cerezyme should be approached with caution in patients who have exhibited symptoms of hypersensitivity to the product.\n\n【11】 ### Precautions\n- In less than 1% of the patient population, pulmonary hypertension and pneumonia have also been observed during treatment with Cerezyme (imiglucerase for injection). Pulmonary hypertension and pneumonia are known complications of Gaucher disease and have been observed both in patients receiving and not receiving Cerezyme. No causal relationship with Cerezyme has been established. Patients with respiratory symptoms in the absence of fever should be evaluated for the presence of pulmonary hypertension.\n- Therapy with Cerezyme should be directed by physicians knowledgeable in the management of patients with Gaucher disease.\n- Caution may be advisable in administration of Cerezyme to patients previously treated with Ceredase (alglucerase injection) and who have developed antibody to Ceredase or who have exhibited symptoms of hypersensitivity to Ceredase.\n\n【12】 ## Clinical Trials Experience\n- Since the approval of Cerezyme (imiglucerase for injection) in May 1994, Genzyme has maintained a worldwide post-marketing database of spontaneously reported adverse events and adverse events discussed in the medical literature. The percentage of events for each reported adverse reaction term has been calculated using the number of patients from these sources as the denominator for total patient exposure to Cerezyme since 1994. Actual patient exposure is difficult to obtain due to the voluntary nature of the database and the continuous accrual and loss of patients over that span of time. The actual number of patients exposed to Cerezyme since 1994 is likely to be greater than estimated from these voluntary sources and, therefore, the percentages calculated for the frequencies of adverse reactions are most likely greater than the actual incidences.\n- Experience in patients treated with Cerezyme has revealed that approximately 13.8% of patients experienced adverse events which were judged to be related to Cerezyme administration and which occurred with an increase in frequency. Some of the adverse events were related to the route of administration. These include discomfort, pruritus, burning, swelling or sterile abscess at the site of venipuncture. Each of these events was found to occur in < 1% of the total patient population.\n- Additional adverse reactions that have been reported in approximately 6.5% of patients treated with Cerezyme include: nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, fatigue, headache, fever, dizziness, chills, backache, and tachycardia. Each of these events was found to occur in < 1.5% of the total patient population.\n- Incidence rates cannot be calculated from the spontaneously reported adverse events in the post-marketing database. From this database, the most commonly reported adverse events in children (defined as ages 2 – 12 years) included dyspnea, fever, nausea, flushing, vomiting, and coughing, whereas in adolescents (>12 – 16 years) and in adults (>16 years) the most commonly reported events included headache, pruritis, and rash.\n- In addition to the adverse reactions that have been observed in patients treated with Cerezyme, transient peripheral edema has been reported for this therapeutic class of drug.\n\n【13】 ## Postmarketing Experience\nThere is limited information regarding Postmarketing Experience of Imiglucerase in the drug label.\n\n【14】 #Drug Interactions\nThere is limited information regarding Imiglucerase Drug Interactions in the drug label.\n\n【15】 ### Pregnancy\nPregnancy Category (FDA): C\n- Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Cerezyme (imiglucerase for injection). It is also not known whether Cerezyme can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproductive capacity. Cerezyme should not be administered during pregnancy except when the indication and need are clear and the potential benefit is judged by the physician to substantially justify the risk.\n- Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) Pregnancy Category\nThere is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Imiglucerase in women who are pregnant.\n\n【16】 ### Labor and Delivery\nThere is no FDA guidance on use of Imiglucerase during labor and delivery.\n\n【17】 ### Nursing Mothers\n- It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Cerezyme (imiglucerase for injection) is administered to a nursing woman.\n\n【18】 ### Pediatric Use\n- The safety and effectiveness of Cerezyme (imiglucerase for injection) have been established in patients between 2 and 16 years of age. Use of Cerezyme in this age group is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of Cerezyme and Ceredase (alglucerase injection) in adults and pediatric patients, with additional data obtained from the medical literature and from long-term postmarketing experience. Cerezyme has been administered to patients younger than 2 years of age, however the safety and effectiveness in patients younger than 2 have not been established.\n\n【19】 ### Geriatic Use\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Imiglucerase with respect to geriatric patients.\n\n【20】 ### Gender\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Imiglucerase with respect to specific gender populations.\n\n【21】 ### Race\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Imiglucerase with respect to specific racial populations.\n\n【22】 ### Renal Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Imiglucerase in patients with renal impairment.\n\n【23】 ### Hepatic Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Imiglucerase in patients with hepatic impairment.\n\n【24】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Imiglucerase in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n\n【25】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\nThere is no FDA guidance one the use of Imiglucerase in patients who are immunocompromised.\n\n【26】 ### Administration\n- Intravenous\n\n【27】 ### Monitoring\n- It is suggested that patients be monitored periodically for IgG antibody formation during the first year of treatment.\n\n【28】 #IV Compatibility\nThere is limited information regarding IV Compatibility of Imiglucerase in the drug label.\n\n【29】 #Overdosage\n- Experience with doses up to 240 U/kg every 2 weeks have been reported. At that dose there have been no reports of obvious toxicity.\n\n【30】 ## Mechanism of Action\n- Gaucher disease is characterized by a deficiency of β-glucocerebrosidase activity, resulting in accumulation of glucocerebroside in tissue macrophages which become engorged and are typically found in the liver, spleen, and bone marrow and occasionally in lung, kidney, and intestine. Secondary hematologic sequelae include severe anemia and thrombocytopenia in addition to the characteristic progressive hepatosplenomegaly, skeletal complications, including osteonecrosis and osteopenia with secondary pathological fractures. Cerezyme (imiglucerase for injection) catalyzes the hydrolysis of glucocerebroside to glucose and ceramide. In clinical trials, Cerezyme improved anemia and thrombocytopenia, reduced spleen and liver size, and decreased cachexia to a degree similar to that observed with Ceredase (alglucerase injection).\n\n【31】 ## Structure\n- Cerezyme (imiglucerase for injection) is an analogue of the human enzyme β-glucocerebrosidase, produced by recombinant DNA technology. β-Glucocerebrosidase (β-D-glucosyl-N-acylsphingosine glucohydrolase, E.C. 3.2.1.45) is a lysosomal glycoprotein enzyme which catalyzes the hydrolysis of the glycolipid glucocerebroside to glucose and ceramide.\n- Cerezyme is produced by recombinant DNA technology using mammalian cell culture (Chinese hamster ovary). Purified imiglucerase is a monomeric glycoprotein of 497 amino acids, containing 4 N-linked glycosylation sites (Mr = 60,430). Imiglucerase differs from placental glucocerebrosidase by one amino acid at position 495, where histidine is substituted for arginine. The oligosaccharide chains at the glycosylation sites have been modified to terminate in mannose sugars. The modified carbohydrate structures on imiglucerase are somewhat different from those on placental glucocerebrosidase. These mannose-terminated oligosaccharide chains of imiglucerase are specifically recognized by endocytic carbohydrate receptors on macrophages, the cells that accumulate lipid in Gaucher disease.\n- Cerezyme is supplied as a sterile, non-pyrogenic, white to off-white lyophilized product.\n- An enzyme unit (U) is defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of 1 micromole of the synthetic substrate para-nitrophenyl-β-D-glucopyranoside (pNP-Glc) per minute at 37°C. The product is stored at 2-8°C (36-46°F). After reconstitution with Sterile Water for Injection, USP, the imiglucerase concentration is 40 U/mL . Reconstituted solutions have a pH of approximately\n\n【32】 ## Pharmacodynamics\nThere is limited information regarding Pharmacodynamics of Imiglucerase in the drug label.\n\n【33】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n- During one-hour intravenous infusions of four doses (7.5, 15, 30, 60 U/kg) of Cerezyme (imiglucerase for injection), steady-state enzymatic activity was achieved by 30 minutes. Following infusion, plasma enzymatic activity declined rapidly with a half-life ranging from 3.6 to 10.4 minutes. Plasma clearance ranged from 9.8 to 20.3 mL/min/kg (mean ± S.D. 14.5 ± 4.0 mL/min/kg). The volume of distribution corrected for weight ranged from 0.09 to 0.15 L/kg (0.12 ± 0.02 L/kg). These variables do not appear to be influenced by dose or duration of infusion. However, only one or two patients were studied at each dose level and infusion rate. The pharmacokinetics of Cerezyme do not appear to be different from placental-derived alglucerase (Ceredase).\n- In patients who developed IgG antibody to Cerezyme, an apparent effect on serum enzyme levels resulted in diminished volume of distribution and clearance and increased elimination half-life compared to patients without antibody\n\n【34】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\n- Studies have not been conducted in either animals or humans to assess the potential effects of Cerezyme (imiglucerase for injection) on carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, or impairment of fertility.\n\n【35】 #Clinical Studies\nThere is limited information regarding Clinical Studies of Imiglucerase in the drug label.\n\n【36】 #How Supplied\n- Cerezyme (imiglucerase for injection) is supplied as a sterile, non-pyrogenic, lyophilized product.

NIOSH found that a relationship exists between diacetyl exposures and lower pulmonary function. Utilizing this analysis, NIOSH recommends keeping exposure to diacetyl below a concentration of 5 parts per billion as a time-weighted average during a 40-hour work week. To further protect against effects of short-term exposures, NIOSH recommends a short-term exposure limit for diacetyl of 25 parts per billion for a 15-minute time period.\nIn many operations, 2,3-pentanedione is being used to substitute for diacetyl. Published toxicological studies indicate that 2,3-pentanedione exposure can cause damage similar to that caused by diacetyl in laboratory studies. Therefore, NIOSH recommends keeping occupational exposure to 2,3-pentanedione below a level comparable to the level recommended for diacetyl. However, the recommended sampling and analytical method can only reliably quantify it to 9.3 parts per billion in an 8-hour sample. NIOSH also recommends a short-term exposure limit for 2,3-pentanedione of 31 parts per billion during a 15-minute period.\nEngineering and work practices are available to control diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione exposures below the recommended exposure limits. A hierarchy of controls including elimination, substitution, engineering controls, administrative controls, and the use of personal protective equipment should be followed to control workplace exposures.\n\n【1】 #Executive Summary\nDiacetyl and its substitute, 2,3-pentanedione, are widely used flavoring compounds. There have been extensive reports of serious respiratory disease and decreased lung function in employees exposed to diacetyl. The NIOSH objective in establishing recommended exposure limits (RELs) for diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione is to reduce the risk of respiratory impairment (decreased lung function) and the severe irreversible lung disease obliterative bronchiolitis associated with occupational exposure to these compounds. In this disease the smallest airways in the lungs, the bronchioles, become scarred and constricted, blocking the movement of air. In addition, maintaining exposures below the RELs will help prevent other adverse health effects including but not limited to irritation of the skin, eyes, and respiratory tract in exposed employees. The recommendation to limit exposure to diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione is based upon data from human and animal studies and the quantitative risk assessment; however, additional considerations include sampling and analytical feasibility and the achievability of engineering controls.\nDiacetyl is used extensively in the food flavoring and production industries, and occupational exposure to this substance has been associated with severe respiratory impairment and the disease obliterative bronchiolitis. 2,3-Pentanedione, which has been used as a substitute for diacetyl, is also of concern because of structural similarities with diacetyl and because animal studies show similar toxicity for the respiratory tract ,Hubbs et al. 2012;.\nThe first observation of obliterative bronchiolitis in a food production employee may have occurred in 1985 in a facility where diacetyl was listed among ingredients used in making flavorings for the baking industry . The link between exposure to diacetyl and lower pulmonary function was confirmed in the early 2000s, and research further showed that diacetyl exposure leads to a decrease in pulmonary function . Occupational exposures to diacetyl have been assessed in a variety of food production and flavoring facilities Martyny et al. 2008;NIOSH 2003aNIOSH , b, 2004aNIOSH , b, 2006NIOSH , 2007NIOSH , 2008aNIOSH , b, 2009NIOSH , 20\nAnother compound, acetoin, was present along with diacetyl in many of the workplaces where obliterative bronchiolitis occurred in employees who made or used diacetyl ; . However, current data indicate that acetoin is considerably less hazardous than diacetyl and it does not have the reactive α-dicarbonyl group, which has been implicated in the toxicity of diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione .\nMean diacetyl air concentrations measured at the first microwave popcorn facility where obliterative bronchiolitis was reported were highest in the mixing room (57.2 parts per million ), followed by the packaging area (2.8 ppm)  . Mean personal diacetyl air concentrations at five other microwave popcorn plants were lower: 0.023 to 1.16 ppm in the mixing room and 0.35 to 1.33 ppm in the packaging rooms/areas . Mean full-shift diacetyl air concentrations measured vi Occupational Exposure to Diacetyl and 2,3-Pentanedione at flavor manufacturing facilities ranged from 0.07 ppm to 2.73 ppm Martyny et al. 2008;NIOSH 2003aNIOSH , b, 2004aNIOSH , b, 2006NIOSH , 2007NIOSH , 2008aNIOSH , b, 2009NIOSH , 20\nIn addition to cases consistent with obliterative bronchiolitis in flavoring manufacturing, diacetyl manufacturing, and microwave popcorn production, case reports have surfaced in other industries in which flavorings are introduced. In cookie manufacturing with artificial butter flavoring in Brazil, four cases of bronchiolitis were described in young men, aged 24 to 27 years, who had worked between 1 and 3 years handling flavorings in preparation of cookie dough . In a coffee production plant, two cases have biopsy confirmation of obliterative bronchiolitis among employees with artificial flavorings exposure in the production of roasted coffee beans and ground coffee . In 2012, NIOSH conducted a health hazard evaluation (HHE) involving 75 current employees (88% participation) . Excluding the five sentinel former employees (all never-smokers under age 42), standardized morbidity ratios were elevated 1.6-fold for shortness of breath and 2.7-fold for obstructive spirometric abnormalities.\nThese findings in conjunction with laboratory experiments providing biological plausibility, meet the standard criteria used to determine causation: that an exposure is the likely cause of specific health effects .\nNIOSH has reviewed the literature on diacetyl toxicology and exposures in the workplace and subsequently conducted a quantitative risk assessment. The quantitative risk assessment used to derive the REL was based solely on human (employee) data, but the results were informed and corroborated by animal risk assessments. Specifically, a statistically significant exposure-associated reduction in the forced expiratory volume in one second/forced vital capacity (FEV 1 /FVC) ratio and percent predicted FEV 1 (ppFEV 1 ) and an exposure-associated estimated incidence of symptomatic obstructive lung disease were observed.\nIt should be noted that diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione are found in cigarette smoke  and some flavored e-cigarettes .S. population. Most importantly, because diacetyl causes obstructive lung disease and because smoking causes obstructive lung disease, the presence of diacetyl in cigarette smoke in no way diminishes the need to control diacetyl exposures in employees.\nNIOSH concludes that the toxicological responses to diacetyl observed in animal studies support the conclusions of the epidemiologically-based risk assessment for diacetyl. Further, the animal-based\n\n【2】 On this basis, NIOSH recommends a REL of 5 ppb for diacetyl as a time-weighted average (TWA) for up to 8 hours/day during a 40-hour workweek. NIOSH has determined that employees exposed to diacetyl at this level for 8 hours a day, 40 hours a week for a 45-year working lifetime should have no more than a 1/1,000 excess risk of lung function falling below the lower limit of normal due to diacetyl exposure.\nTo ensure that employee exposures are routinely below the REL for diacetyl, NIOSH also recommends using an action level (AL) of 2.6 ppb with the exposure monitoring program to ensure that all control efforts (engineering controls, medical surveillance, and work practices) are in place and working properly. When exposures exceed the AL, employers should take corrective action (determine the source of exposure, identify methods for controlling exposure) to ensure that exposures are maintained below the REL.\n2,3-Pentanedione is used in many operations; it is structurally similar to diacetyl because it is a 5-carbon alpha diketone, whereas diacetyl is a 4-carbon alpha diketone. Published toxicology studies indicate that 2,3-pentanedione exposure can cause damage to the lining of airways similar to that caused by diacetyl in laboratory studies ,Hubbs et al. 2012;. Therefore, NIOSH recommends controlling occupational exposure to 2,3-pentanedione to a level comparable to that recommended for diacetyl. However, analytical limitations allow 2,3-pentanedione to be reliably measured only above 9.3 ppb. This recommended exposure limit is slightly higher than the recommended exposure limit for diacetyl. NIOSH recommends keeping exposure to 2,3-pentanedione below 9.3 ppb in an 8-hour average during a 40-hour work week. NIOSH has estimated that employees exposed to 2,3-pentanedione at this concentration should have a similar risk of decreased pulmonary function as employees exposed to diacetyl. NIOSH also recommends a short-term exposure limit for 2,3-pentanedione of 31 ppb during a 15-minute period.\nResearch into various flavoring industries has led to the development of engineering controls that may help reduce employee exposure to diacetyl, 2,3-pentanedione, and other chemicals.\nAll permanent, temporary, and contract employees who work in or enter areas where diacetyl, 2,3-pentanedione, or similar flavoring compounds or products that contain these compounds are used or produced should be included in the medical monitoring program. Employees who work in or enter these areas for a total of 40 or more hours per year should be included in the medical monitoring program.\nBecause of the potentially rapid progression and grave consequences of flavoring-related lung disease, it is important that the medical monitoring program director be able to quickly evaluate clinical data and make medical judgments about appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic measures, including medical removal. For this reason, the medical monitoring program director should be a licensed physician with training and experience in identifying and preventing occupational lung disease. The medical program that includes the following:\ngood quality spirometry testing for pulmonary function  medical evaluation for employees found with abnormal spirometry  removal from exposure pending medical evaluation  analysis of group medical surveillance and longitudinal spirometry data to assess workrelated risk factors on the basis of job, task, area, and other exposure indices\nThe purpose of this epidemiologic surveillance is to assist monitoring physicians in assessing the likelihood of work-related causes of abnormalities and to prioritize interventions, if needed. Identifying excessive declines in spirometry, even if absolute spirometric values remain within the normal range, offers the best opportunity to intervene before progression to symptomatic impairment and to prevent the development of clinically significant occupational lung disease. The rapid onset and progression of diacetyl-related lung disease requires more frequent medical monitoring evaluations be done than with slowly progressive occupational lung diseases, such as silicosis and coal employees pneumoconiosis. While the focus of this document is on diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione, NIOSH has concern regarding other volatile and reactive flavorings potentially capable of producing similar toxic effects. Therefore, NIOSH recommends that such exposures be carefully considered and controlled in consultation with workplace safety professionals and the recommendations contained within this criteria document.\n1 Introduction\n\n【3】 #Purpose\nThis document presents the criteria and components of a recommended standard necessary to reduce or eliminate significant risk of health impairment from exposure to diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione and prevent flavorings-related lung disease. This document was developed in accordance with the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 . This Act charges NIOSH with recommending occupational safety and health standards and developing criteria for toxic materials. These criteria are to describe exposures that are safe for various periods of employment, including but not limited to the exposures at which no employee will suffer diminished health, functional capacity, or life expectancy as a result of his or her work experience.\n\n【4】 #Scope\nThis criteria document contains a review of relevant scientific information related to diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione, and provides the rationale and criteria for establishing appropriate risk management recommendations.... Additionally, recommendations for an effective respiratory protection program are provided..\n\n【5】 #Background\nDiacetyl is one of the main components in butter flavoring that imparts a buttery taste, and it has been identified as a prominent volatile organic compound . Diacetyl is used as a natural and artificial flavoring ingredient and aroma carrier in bakery products, dairy products, snack foods, and more. It is mainly used as a butter flavoring but is also used in the flavor formulation of a number of other flavors, including but not limited to strawberry, caramel, hazelnut, and butterscotch. It is also present as a natural byproduct in some fermented food products such as beer and roasted food products such as coffee. Occupational exposures in the flavoring and food production industries have been associated with respiratory disease, including obliterative bronchiolitis, an uncommon lung disease often characterized by fixed airways obstruction.\nDay et al.  observed the flavoring compound 2,3-pentanedione in food production facilities. This compound has been used as a diacetyl substitute in many flavor manufacturing facilities because it has a related chemical structure and similar flavor properties to diacetyl. Published reports on the toxicity of 2,3-pentanedione from experimental inhalation studies with rats indicate that exposure causes airway epithelial damage similar to that produced by diacetyl ,Hubbs et al. 2012;.\nNo state or national registries are available to identify potential cases of obliterative bronchiolitis among employees. In 1985, two employees with fixed obstructive lung disease suggestive of obliterative bronchiolitis were observed in a facility where flavorings with diacetyl were made for the baking industry NIOSH 1986. Catastrophic fixed airways disease suggestive of obliterative bronchiolitis was observed in these two former mixing employees who were young nonsmokers with job tasks that involved blending corn starch and flour with various flavorings. Two additional employees who formerly had mixing responsibilities also had otherwise unexplained obstruction, whereas two current mixers were unaffected. A review of common ingredients listed diacetyl among other flavoring compounds.\nIn the microwave popcorn industry, the first occurrences of obliterative bronchiolitis were observed in the year 2000 when eight employees formerly employed in a microwave popcorn facility were diagnosed with the disease . The observation of this case series led to the identification of another case of obliterative bronchiolitis in a separate facility . Since then, numerous cases of obliterative bronchiolitis have been observed in the microwave popcorn industry CDC 2002;Ezrailson 2002;NIOSH 2003NIOSH , 2004aNIOSH , b, 2006Parmet 2002;Schachter 2002. In addition, a retrospective epidemiologic study found cases of obliterative bronchiolitis in employees who were employed in a diacetyl manufacturing plant with exposures to diacetyl, acetoin, acetic acid, and acetaldehyde .\nEmployees within the flavoring production industry have complex exposures in terms of the physical form of the agents (vapors, mists, and airborne dusts) and the number of different chemicals used. Although thousands of flavoring compounds are in use, few have occupational exposure limits. The Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association (FEMA) reports that of the more than 1,000 flavoring compounds considered to be potential respiratory irritants or hazards, only 46 have established OSHA permissible exposure limits (PELs) . Given the lack of occupational exposure limits for most flavoring compounds, assessing workplace exposures and developing exposure control guidance are critical to help reduce the risk of flavorings-related lung disease.\nIn 2010, California promulgated a regulation for occupational exposure to food flavorings containing diacetyl that requires installation of exposure controls to reduce exposures to the lowest feasible levels. In 2012, the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) published a threshold limit value of 0.010 ppm 8-hour TWA with a STEL of 0.020 ppm for diacetyl .\nIn 2014, the European Commission published the Recommendation from the Scientific Committee on Occupational Exposure Limits of 0.02 ppm 8-hour TWA with a STEL of 0.10 ppm for diacetyl .\n\n【6】 #Chemical and Physical Properties\nThe compound 2,3-pentanedione has CAS number 600-  and is also referred to by the name acetyl propionyl. Both diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione are alpha diketones or vicinal diketones (also referred to less specifically as alpha dicarbonyls), which means that their molecular structures contain two carbonyl functional groups that are adjacent to one another, and the carbon molecules attached to the oxygen molecules are also attached to only carbon molecules.\nThe odor threshold of diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione has been reported by many studies . It is not uncommon for odor threshold values reported in the literature to range over four orders of magnitude for the same chemical . Odor threshold variability can result from the source of data, the characteristics of human olfactory response, and the differences in experimental methodology . The following criteria were used to analyze the diacetyl and 2,3-pentandione odor threshold literature:  only primary odor threshold sources that were found in the literature and that were written in English were used;  only sources that clearly indicated the type of threshold being measured as a detection or recognition threshold were used;  sources that used a panel of at least five judges to account for the range of olfactory sensitivity in the population were used; and  sources that presented the different concentrations of odor samples in a way that eliminated olfactory fatigue were used. The geometric mean of the selected values was reported in  Diacetyl can be synthesized chemically from four starting materials:  from methyl ethyl ketone, either by converting it into an isonitroso compound and then hydrolyzing with hydrochloric acid or by partial oxidation of methyl ethyl ketone over a copper or vanadium oxide catalyst  (odor measurement of diacetyl vapor-air mixtures). Note: geometric mean of two literature reported threshold values with a geometric standard deviation of 5.33 ppb. 0.84 ppb  (odor measurement of diacetyl vapor in the headspace above aqueous solutions, diacetyl concentrations in solution converted to air concentrations using Henry's Law constant). Note: geometric mean of three literature reported threshold values with a geometric standard deviation of 1.44 ppb. 1.2 ppb  (recognition threshold) Note: not a geometric mean because obtained from a single source.\n15 ppb  (odor measurement of 2,3-pentanedione vapor-air mixtures).

The chemical synthesis of 2,3-pentanedione is achieved in the following ways:  the condensation of lactic acid and an alkali metal lactate ;  the acid-catalyzed condensation of 1-hydroxyacetone with paraldehyde ; or  the oxidation of 2-pentanone with excess sodium nitrite and diluted hydrochloric acid in the presence of hydroxylamine hydrochloride .\n\n【7】 #Production Uses and Applications\nThe flavor manufacturing industry commonly uses diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione during flavor formulation production. Flavor formulations are then sold to downstream users for the production of flavored food products. Flavored food production is the process of manufacturing food and beverage products that contain added flavor formulations or flavorings to enhance or modify the taste of the product. Examples of flavored food products include bakery products such as cake mixes, flour and margarines, dairy products such as cheese and yogurt, snack foods such as soft spreads and crackers, beverages such as soft drinks, in addition to candy, ice cream, frozen foods, and many other food and beverage products. The addition of concentrated flavorings including diacetyl is a cost effective way to impart the desired properties to manufactured food items.\nIn flavor formulations, diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione are typically found as components in liquid solutions but can also be added to powders in dry mixtures to create a solid particulate formulation. Many volatile compounds are also encapsulated in an amorphous carbohydrate, producing more stable products with more manageable properties. Encapsulated powder flavorings are often created with a spray dryer, which converts a slurry mixture into a powder in which the flavorings are surrounded by the powder instead of simply coating the powder. When the encapsulated powder comes into contact with moisture, the flavor is released quickly and completely .\nStarter distillate, produced by fermenting milk with starter cultures, contains diacetyl in the range of 1% to 5% and is often used as a flavor enhancer in the dairy industry. Diacetyl is the major flavor component of starter distillate, constituting as much as 80% to 90% of the mixture's organic flavor compounds . A NIOSH health hazard evaluation (HHE) at a modified dairy production company found concentrations of airborne diacetyl ranging up to 2.14 parts per million on a full-shift TWA basis . Diacetyl is also used as a chemical modifier of arginine residues in proteins in studying glycation (the nonenzymatic browning of foods or the nonenzymatic binding of sugar and protein molecules in the body) .\nOther uses for diacetyl include reactant/starting material in chemical or biochemical reactions, analytical reagent, antimicrobial/preservative, electron stabilizing compound and modifier of radiation response for chemical and biological systems, and photoinitiator/photosensitizer in polymerizations .\n\n【8】 #Potential for Exposures\nIt is difficult to quantify the number of employees directly involved with flavor manufacturing and more specifically having exposure to diacetyl or diacetyl substitutes in the United States.\nAccording to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Non-Confidential Inventory Updating Report, diacetyl had an aggregate production volume between 10,000 and 500,000 pounds in ,EPA 20\nThe North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) category 311, the most relevant category, indicates nearly 1.5 million employees are employed in food manufacturing.\nInitial research concerning occupational exposure to diacetyl has focused on employees who directly produce flavorings or use them in the microwave popcorn industry.\nEmployers in the food manufacturing sector are generally small business owners with 89%  and 2,3-Pentanedione 9 1 . Introduction of establishments employing fewer than 100 employees and nearly 53% of establishments employing fewer than 10 employees . Industries that comprise food manufacturing can be found in every state in the United States; however, concentrations of specific industries are found in general geographic locations. For example, in 2004, 33% of the cheese manufacturing employees employed in the United States were in Wisconsin, and 20% of employees employed in the fruit and vegetable preservation industry were in California .\nAIHA .

Exposures to diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione can be monitored using personal and area (environmental) air samples because the predominant route of exposure is inhalation. Results from air sampling can be compared with established criteria such as the NIOSH RELs. Measuring employees' exposures to diacetyl or 2,3-pentanedione may help identify processes, locations, or tasks with exposures of concern; guide corrective actions such as engineering controls; identify improved work practices; and select appropriate respiratory protection.\n\n【13】 Many work environments have mixed exposures, with multiple chemical agents present.\nAlthough the primary focus of this criteria document is diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione, other compounds can also be of concern. Depending upon the processes employed in a workplace, sampling should be conducted for agents of concern to maintain safe work environments. Common sampling and analytical methods to determine concentrations of diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione are presented in Appendices A-E.\n\n【14】 #Time-integrated Air Sampling and Analytical\nMethods for Diacetyl and 2,3-Pentanedione Vapor\nPersonal breathing zone sampling is the preferred approach for estimating employee exposure. For personal sampling, an employee wears the air sampling equipment, and the inlet to the collection medium is positioned within the employee's breathing zone. Area sampling is performed for several purposes such as to evaluate exposure characteristics associated with an area or process, and to determine the efficiency of control systems. While the same sampling equipment may be used in some cases for both personal and area sampling, area sampling is stationary, in contrast to personal sampling, which allows for mobility by accompanying the employee throughout the sampling period.\n\n【15】 #OSHA Methods 1012 and 10\nIn response to the need for longer sampling time periods with a lower limit of detection or reliable quantitation limit, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) validated two sampling and analytical methods, OSHA Method 1012 and OSHA Method 1013. These methods can be used for the simultaneous determination of diacetyl and acetoin. As of the publication of this document, these are the recommended methods for diacetyl.\nOSHA Methods 1012 and 1013 use two 600 milligram (mg) sorbent tubes containing specially cleaned and dried silica gel ,SKC Inc.Eighty Four,PA, in series and air is sampled at a flow rate of 50 milliliters per minute (mL/min) for up to 180 minutes for determination of TWA concentrations, and a flow rate of 200 mL/min for 15 minutes for short-term concentration measurements. An opaque sampling tube protective cover should be used in conjunction with the sampler to prevent the glass sampling tube from breaking and to protect the sample from light, which can decompose diacetyl and acetoin. After sampling, the tubes should be separated, capped, and protected from light with aluminum foil or other opaque material. There is no requirement that samples be kept cold during shipping or storage.\nOSHA Method 1013 has a reliable quantitation limit of 12 ppb (0.041 mg/m 3 ) diacetyl for a 9-liter sample, and samples are analyzed by gas chromatography using a flame ionization detector (GC-FID). OSHA Method 1012 has a nearly 10 times lower RQL of 1.3 ppb (4.57 micrograms per meter cubed ) diacetyl for a 9-liter sample, which is achieved by derivatizing diacetyl with 2 milligram per milliliter (mg/mL) O- .\nAn advantage of OSHA Method 1013 is that sample preparation can be performed in one hour, whereas the derivatization step of OSHA Method 1012 requires 36 hours. After samples have been extracted and analyzed using OSHA Method 1013, if needed (e.g. if sample concentration is not detectable), they can be derivatized and analyzed using OSHA Method 1012 to benefit from its lower detection capability.\n\n【16】 #OSHA Method 10\n\n【17】 #OSHA Method PV21\nSuperseded by OSHA Methods 1012 and 1013, OSHA Method PV2118  was developed as an air sampling method for diacetyl that uses two 150/75 mg silica gel sorbent tubes in series  at a recommended flow rate of 50 mL/min for one hour. In response to the limited capacity of this sampler in humid environments, a modified version of OSHA Method PV2118 was used by some practitioners in the field. The modified method uses larger 400/200 mg sorbent tubes packed with specially cleaned silica gel  allowing for greater sample capacity without breakthrough of diacetyl. Sample analysis remained unchanged.\n\n【18】 #NIOSH Method 25\nWhile no longer recommended for use, NIOSH developed NIOSH Method 2557,NIOSH 1994 for measuring diacetyl vapor in air. It called for the collection of samples onto a 150/75 mg carbon molecular sieve sorbent tube (Cat. No. 226-121, SKC Inc. Eighty Four, PA) at a flow rate between 10 and 200 mL/min for a sample volume between 1 and 10 liters. The method specifies that samples be stored cold and analyzed within 7 days of sampling.\nUntil 2007, NIOSH Method 2557 was the predominant air sampling and analytical method for diacetyl used in the field, but it is no longer recommended for use .  field and chamber investigations indicated that NIOSH Method 2557 was adversely affected by humidity, resulting in an underestimation of true diacetyl concentrations. To aid in the evaluation of sampling and analytical methods for diacetyl, a field comparison study between new and existing sampling collection methods was conducted . Side-by-side field samples were collected in flavor manufacturing facilities and analyzed according to NIOSH Method 2557, OSHA Method PV2118, and a modified version of OSHA Method PV2118. The results of this field work confirmed the tendency of NIOSH Method 2557 to underestimate the true concentration of diacetyl as humidity increases. However, no mathematical correlation was found in this data set which would produce an adjustment factor to allow for correction of results.\nAs a result, NIOSH researchers collaborated with scientists at the OSHA Salt Lake Technical Center laboratory to study the effects of humidity on measured diacetyl air concentrations using NIOSH Method 2557. This laboratory has chamber facilities for the generation of known diacetyl air concentrations with the ability to control both temperature and relative humidity (RH). Controlled test atmospheres of diacetyl were generated and sampled through an array of sampling tubes at calibrated flow rates. Test atmospheres were controlled for diacetyl concentration, temperature, and relative humidity.\nResults indicated that diacetyl recoveries for NIOSH Method 2557 were affected by absolute humidity (AH), storage time of sample tube prior to extraction, and diacetyl air concentration. The study resulted in the development of a mathematical procedure to adjust diacetyl concentrations previously measured using NIOSH Method 25\n\n【19】 #Other Air Sampling Method(s) in Development\nBecause of current interest in occupational exposure to flavoring compounds, new methods continue to be developed for their measurement. At this time, however, none of these methods are validated.\nA method is being developed by NIOSH to measure alpha-dicarbonyl compounds (such as diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione) in air via derivatization with 1,2-phenylenediamine. This compound is known to react with alpha-dicarbonyl compounds to form stable quinoxaline derivatives . In this method, air is sampled through a sorbent tube containing silica gel coated with 1,2-phenylenediamine at 0.1% by weight. Samples are extracted in the lab and extraction solutions analyzed by gas chromatographynitrogen/phosphorus detection (GC-NPD). A potential advantage of this method is greater sampling volume and sampling time without the breakthrough that would be experienced if sampling for an extended time with uncoated silica gel tubes. Experiments to date indicate no breakthrough of diacetyl, 2,3-pentanedione, or 2,3-hexanedione from the sampling tubes after passing 144 liters of air at 80% RH. This enables sampling for 8 hours without changing out sampling tubes. Another advantage is the high sensitivity of NPD detection, which will enable measurement of alpha-dicarbonyl compounds below the proposed REL for diacetyl of 5 ppb.\nA new method for collecting air samples using evacuated canisters has been evaluated for several VOCs . The 450-milliliter canisters, which can be equipped with either instantaneous grab sampling attachments or restricted-flow controllers (for task-based or full-shift sampling), are suitable for collection of area and personal samples. The air samples are analyzed for VOCs using a preconcentrator/gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) system. At present, this canister method is in the process of being validated with three additional compounds, diacetyl, 2,3-pentanedione and 2,3-hexanedione, and is being reviewed for incorporation into the NIOSH Manual of Analytical Methods.\n\n【20】 #NIOSH Method 2549 -Qualitative Determination of Volatile Organic Compounds\nTo sample for diacetyl, 2,3-pentanedione, as well as a wide range of other flavoring VOCs, thermal desorption sorbent tubes can provide a high degree of sensitivity. This is because desorption of compounds from thermal desorption tubes does not involve dilution into an extraction solvent. Instead, compounds are thermally desorbed from the sampling tubes in a thermal desorption system. This technique is primarily used for qualitative screening purposes because of the ability of thermal desorption tubes to capture a diverse range of VOCs, but specific compounds can be quantified if corresponding standards are analyzed along with the samples. The thermal desorption tube is usually a stainless steel tube configured and filled with a single sorbent bed or multiple beds of various sorbents including carbonaceous materials, carbon molecular sieves, and/or porous polymers. The sorbents can be heated to high temperatures without breakdown or the generation of artifacts, so thermal desorption tubes can be cleaned and reused multiple times. The tubes are analyzed with a thermal desorber-GC-MS (TD-GC-MS) .\n\n【21】 #Sampling for Diacetyl and 2,3-Pentanedione in Airborne Dust and in Bulk Materials\nAlthough diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione are normally found in liquid form, they can also be encapsulated in or coated on a powder substrate.\nAir sampling for dust that may be generated during handling of powdered flavorings can be achieved by active sampling methods. During the sample collection, however, some of the diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione may volatilize, i.e. release from the dust particles and enter the vapor phase due to contact with moisture. In addition, environments in which dust is generated may also contain vapors of the flavoring compounds. Sorbent tubes used for the collection of vapor-phase diacetyl or 2,3-pentanedione cannot be used to adequately sample for dust at the low flow rates required by the tubes . As a result, modifications to the sampling methods are necessary to assess exposure to both vapor and dust.\n\n【22】 #Size-Selective Air Sampling for Dust\nMeasurement of airborne dust particles according to their size (e.g. inhalable, thoracic, and respirable) can help to understand where they may deposit in the respiratory tract. Several types of sampling devices are available (e.g. inhalable dust samplers, impactors, cyclones, and sampling cassettes) to provide measurements of different size fractions of airborne dust. In most cases, dust is collected onto a filter, and the filter can be analyzed via gravimetric means to provide the mass of the dust. Filters should be hydrophobic in nature (e.g. polyvinyl chloride) in order to minimize collection of moisture.\n\n【23】 #Sampling for Diacetyl and 2,3-Pentanedione in Airborne Dust\nA sampling and analytical method is being developed by NIOSH for the quantitative measurement of diacetyl, 2,3-pentanedione, and potentially other flavoring compounds in dust. A sampling cassette with a filter is used to collect airborne dust. The filter is then extracted in water and the aqueous solution is heated to promote the transfer of volatile components to the headspace above the solution.\nThe headspace is sampled using a solid-phase microextraction (SPME) fiber. Headspace SPME involves an equilibrium process in which the volatile analytes establish equilibria between the sample solution, the headspace above the solution, and the polymer-coated fused silica fiber. The mechanism by which the analytes are extracted from the headspace is based on absorption of the analytes onto the fiber. The fiber is inserted directly into a GC-MS. The analytes are extraced from the fiber in the hot injection port and concentrated onto an analytical column. Because the entire sample collected on the fiber is introduced into the GC-MS instrument, as opposed to an aliquot of the sample for methods in which a solvent extract is used, lower detection limits can be achieved. This same procedure can be used to measure diacetyl, 2,3-pentanedione, and potentially other flavoring compounds in samples of bulk powders.\n\n【24】 #Sample collection\nAlthough the review of safety data sheets or other available product documentation may be helpful to identify flavor compounds and potential exposures, they are not always comprehensive or specific. Collection and analysis of bulk flavoring materials can be useful to identify and quantify chemical ingredients and guide exposure assessment strategies. Prior to collecting bulk samples, it is important to consider the physical state of the materials to be sampled (liquids, pastes, or powders), the need to sample opened or unopened containers, the sampling locations, the number of samples to collect, and the amount of sample to collect (often determined by requirements of the laboratory analysis). Bulk samples should be representative; in other words, they should be derived from a variety of sampling locations and obtained from multiple batches to capture any variability in the bulk materials used.\nWhen sampling, it is important to collect and transport the sample in a manner that does not contaminate or cross-contaminate the bulk materials. Only clean or unused sample containers that are compatible with the bulk materials sampled should be used. In general, glass containers are ideal because they will not react with most chemicals, but polyethylene or polypropylene containers may also be appropriate. A typical container is a 20-mL glass scintillation vial with a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)-lined screw cap. Each container should be clearly labeled with information about the bulk sample including material sampled, company and product number, site of sampling, date of sampling, sample tracking number and any hazards or precautions to be taken when handling the bulk sample.\nAfter sampling, consideration should be given to preserve the integrity of the bulk samples during storage and shipping. For example, care should be taken to keep samples cold and protected from light if necessary. In addition, bulk materials should not be shipped together with air samples. Established Department of Transportation (DOT) and International Air and Transport Association (IATA) shipping regulations of hazardous materials and dangerous goods should be followed if hazardous materials are to be shipped.\n\n【25】 #Measurement of diacetyl or 2,3-pentanedione content of bulk powders\n\n【26】 #Real-time Techniques for Diacetyl and Other Flavoring Compounds\nSeveral analytical methods provide real-time or near real-time measurements of volatile compounds in air such as diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione\" This information can be very useful in the development of exposure controls.\n\n【27】 #Photoionization Detectors\nPhotoionization detectors (PIDs) can be used to monitor VOC air concentrations in industrial work environments, including flavoring manufacturing facilities, and have become favored instruments for on-site monitoring because of ease of operation, reliability, versatility, cost, and response to a wide variety of substances. PID instruments measure the relative concentration of VOCs by passing the molecules of those compounds past an ultraviolet lamp that emits radiation over a narrow wavelength range in the ultraviolet region of the electromagnetic spectrum. Photons of ultraviolet radiation will form a molecular ion by removing an electron from orbit around that molecule, allowing for electronic detection of that ion, hence the name.\nThe energy of the radiation emitted by the lamp is inversely proportional to its wavelength, and common PID lamps produce energy in the range from approximately 8 to 12 electron volts (eV). The amount of work required to form a molecular ion by removing an electron from orbit, a property known as ionization potential, varies by compound but for many hydrocarbons is in the range from 7 to 11 eV. Because nitrogen, oxygen, and many of the minor components of air (i.e. water vapor, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, argon) have ionization potentials significantly higher than 12 eV, they are not ionized by the photons emitted from a PID. This property allows for the continuous monitoring of air to obtain an estimate of total hydrocarbon concentration.\nPIDs respond to a broad range of VOCs and do not provide concentrations specific to any particular compound. They are often calibrated for isobutylene and can commonly detect total VOC concentrations from 1 to 2,000 ppm. Modern PIDs can be programmed to measure the concentration of VOCs at fixed time intervals and store these data for subsequent download to a computer.\n\n【28】 #Infrared Analyzers\nThe absorption of infrared (IR) radiation, while more commonly used as a qualitative tool, can also be used to quantify many substances by determination of response relative to known concentrations of that substance. Absorption of electromagnetic radiation in the IR region of the spectrum will produce transitions among vibrational and rotational states of the molecules absorbing that rotation. This absorption can only occur at wavelengths exactly matching the vibrational frequency of a chemical bond, and by selecting the proper analytical wavelength it is possible to obtain reasonable specificity in the compound being quantified.\nDiacetyl can be detected and measured by using an IR gas analyzer such as the Thermo Electron MIRAN \"SapphIRe\" (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. Waltham, MA), which is a portable directreading instrument that has the advantage of displaying real-time concentrations. The SapphIRe is a single beam IR spectrophotometer with a pathlength of 0.5 or 12.5 meters.\nIt has a sample cell volume of 2.23 liters and a built-in pump that runs at approximately 14 liters per minute. Single sample analyses are updated every 0.5 seconds. The detector is available with preloaded factory calibrations for over 100 gases, but because diacetyl is not in this standard library it should be set up for this application by the factory. The concentration range that can be measured is dependent on the compound in question. The high and low settings for the pathlength extend this range considerably.\nFourier transform infrared gas analyzer (FTIR) spectroscopy can be used to analyze a sample of gaseous molecules for both chemical composition and for the concentration of individual chemical constituents. In this analysis, chemical functional groups absorb IR radiation at specific, unique frequencies producing a characteristic spectrum of absorbed versus transmitted radiation. From this spectrum, identification and quantitation of the gas is possible. FTIR analysis can produce real-time quantitation of flavoring compounds in air providing chemical specific full-shift, partial-shift, and peak concentration measures although interferences can pose analytical difficulties in quantifying specific flavoring compounds in complex environments with multiple organic chemicals present.\n\n【29】 #Photoacoustic Spectroscopy (Infrared Absorbance) Techniques\nBecause the absorption of infrared radiation produces transitions among vibrational states of molecules, the application of rapid pulses of IR photons at the proper wavelength can be used to produce pressure variations in the air surrounding the molecules absorbing that radiation. Those pressure variations can be detected as sound waves, the amplitude of which is proportional to the concentration of the analyte of interest. Using IR radiation and measuring this resultant amplitude to quantify an analyte is the technique of photoacoustic spectroscopy.\nDiacetyl has been measured using the Innova photoacoustic infrared gas analyzers, which are direct-reading instruments that have the advantage of displaying real-time concentrations. Both personal and area concentrations were measured during tasks involving exposure to diacetyl in liquid and powder form and then 8-hour TWA exposures were calculated.\nThe powder exposures only measured vapor released and did not include diacetyl adsorbed on the powder .\n\n【30】 #Industrial Hygiene Surveys and Exposure Assessments\nSeveral investigations have been completed by NIOSH and others within the flavoring and food production industries. Exposure conditions vary widely, depending upon site-specific parameters and the processes employed. Many diacetyl samples have been collected to evaluate occupational exposures in the workplace and are described below. When pertinent data on absolute humidity and time to sample extraction were available, measurements obtained using NIOSH Method 2557 were subsequently corrected for the method's tendency to underestimate .\n\n【31】 #NIOSH Microwave Popcorn Production Exposure Assessments\nNIOSH conducted health hazard evaluations at six microwave popcorn plants from 2000 to 2003 . In these facilities diacetyl-containing butter flavorings (liquids, pastes, or powders) were mixed with heated soybean oil in large heated mixing tanks. Salt and coloring were added to the flavoring mixture which was transferred to packaging lines and combined with kernel popcorn in microwaveable bags. Diacetyl concentrations were measured with NIOSH Method 2557 in multiple production locations using personal and area samples.\nIn the plants, 29 area and 17 personal samples were collected in mixing areas, and 67 area and 65 personal samples were collected in packaging areas. Humidity-corrected mean diacetyl air concentrations ranged from 0.63 to 57.2 ppm for area samples and from 0.035 to 1.33 ppm for personal samples in the mixing areas. In the packaging areas, mean concentrations ranged from 0.019 to 3.0 ppm for area samples and from 0.023 to 1.16 ppm for personal samples.\nIn general, diacetyl concentrations were higher in the mixing rooms when the diacetyl-containing butter flavorings were heated.\nIn 2010, a microwave popcorn company asked NIOSH to evaluate chemical constituents in eight liquid butter flavorings because their supplier did not identify chemical substitutes they were using in place of diacetyl .\nQuantitative GC-MS analysis showed acetoin in five samples, 2,3-pentanedione in four, and 2,3-hexanedione in one, all at concentrations of 0.5% or less by weight, except for one acetoin sample at 2%. The more sensitive semiquantitative headspace analysis with thermal detection tubes found diacetyl and acetoin in all samples, 2,3-pentanedione in five, 2,3-hexanedione in one, and 2,3-heptanedione in one.\n\n【32】 #Other Microwave Popcorn Production Exposure Assessments\nWhite et al.  conducted a comprehensive, repeated exposure monitoring campaign at four microwave popcorn plants. A total of 639 full shift diacetyl samples were collected during the day and night shifts in multiple production areas including all employees who worked in the slurry (mixing) room. In that study 49% of 639 samples were below their limit of detection with the maximum measurement of 11.72 ppm after correction for humidity . Overall, exposures were higher for mixers compared to non-mixers and were consistent with diacetyl concentrations observed during previous NIOSH investigations. Diacetyl exposures declined substantially for mixers after the installation of engineering controls.\n\n【33】 #NIOSH Flavoring Manufacturing Exposure Assessments\nIn 1985, NIOSH conducted a health hazard evaluation at a plant in Indiana that produced flavorings for the baking industry . Case histories showed severe fixed obstructive lung disease among employees in a mixing room. Data from previous air monitoring indicated a high dust concentration in the personal breathing zone of an employee during a mixing operation. Diacetyl was on a list of ingredients commonly used at this facility but airborne measurements of diacetyl or other flavoring compounds were not made. Although the investigators were unable to identify specific etiology at that time, they concluded that employees' disease was most likely caused by some agent in the mixing room at the plant.\nNIOSH personnel conducted evaluations at three California flavoring manufacturing facilities where they measured exposures to diacetyl and other related compounds , the mean full-shift concentration of diacetyl in the liquid production room was 0.26 ppm, while in the powder production room it was 0.07 ppm. For personal samples that were collected with NIOSH Method 2557 and not corrected for humidity and time to extraction, the mean concentrations in liquid production and powder production rooms were 0.10 ppm and 0.05 ppm. This work also indicated high variability in concentrations of volatile organic compounds (as measured with a PID) and dust (as measured with personal dust monitors) with time.\nA health hazard evaluation was conducted at a facility in Wisconsin  that manufactured flavorings, modified dairy products, and bacterial additives. One of the flavoring products made at this plant was liquid starter distillate, a product of distillation of fermented milk stock, which contains about 4.5% diacetyl.\nStarter distillate and liquid diacetyl were used to make a variety of powdered (via spray drying processes) and liquid flavorings. NIOSH staff obtained 21 personal and 29 area air samples using modified OSHA Method PV2118 for diacetyl throughout the facility. They found the highest full-shift TWA concentrations in the starter distillate room (geometric mean of 1.78 ppm for personal and 1.06 ppm for area samples), followed by the spray dry room (0.756 and 1.07 ppm) and the flavors room (0.329 and 0.171 ppm). In the spray dry room, FTIR realtime measurements indicated peak diacetyl concentrations up to 90 ppm in the employee's breathing zone while dumping diacetyl from buckets to mixing tanks and while pumping diacetyl from a barrel into buckets. A peak exposure of about 18 ppm was measured in the breathing zone of an employee in the same room while cleaning a barrel with a water hose.\nCompany air sampling data were obtained during a health hazard evaluation at an Indiana flavorings plant that used many ingredients, including diacetyl and starter distillate, in the batch production of a variety of liquid and powdered flavorings . Using NIOSH Method 2557 prior to the HHE request to measure diacetyl, they collected 22 samples. The geometric mean full-shift TWA diacetyl concentration in spray drying operations was 0.123 ppm for personal samples and 0.169 ppm for area samples, while in the other production areas, mean concentrations up to 0.762 ppm and 0.375 ppm were measured for personal and area samples, respectively. Because of the problems with NIOSH Method 2557, these results were likely underestimations of the true concentrations. No data on humidity or time from collection to analysis was available, so no correction could be estimated. Subsequent measurements (45 personal and 71 area samples) by the company, after some control intervention, were collected using validated OSHA sampling Methods PV2118 and 1012 for diacetyl. In the spray drying operations, the geometric mean for full-shift diacetyl personal samples was 0.182 ppm, and for area samples it was 0.167 ppm. The highest mean concentration in the other production areas was 1.900 ppm for personal samples (liquid compounding area) and 0.076 ppm for area samples (coffee and tea area).\nAnother health hazard evaluation was performed at a flavorings plant in Kentucky that produced flavors, colors, and food and beverage ingredients used in the manufacture of consumer products . Diacetyl was not found in use during the NIOSH air sampling survey. Using evacuated canisters, diacetyl and 2,3-hexanedione were not detected in any of the instantaneous or 3-hour area air samples taken in several parts of the plant. 2,3-Pentanedione was detected in two area air samples taken in the liquid samples room. The detection limits ranged from 1.4 to 2.9 ppb for diacetyl, 1.5 to 3.2 ppb for 2,3-pentanedione, and 1.7 to 3.6 ppb for 2,3-hexanedione. Of the two air samples that detected 2,3-pentanedione in the room, one was an instantaneous sample taken near a trash can for disposal of used pipettes while making a flavoring recipe and resulted in a level of 47 ppb.\nThe other sample that detected 26 ppb 2,3-pentanedione was collected for 187 minutes in the center of the room. During the sampling period, several employees were preparing recipes, which included fruit and cheese flavors.\n\n【34】 #Other Flavoring Manufacturing Exposure Assessments\nIn a study evaluating diacetyl exposures in 16 flavor manufacturing facilities, Martyny et al.\nmeasured levels of that compound from the limit of detection (0.01 to 0.18 ppm depending on sample duration) to as high as 60 ppm. Using a protocol designed to obtain measurements during worst-case exposures by collecting samples only during processes in which diacetyl was being used, 181 personal and area samples were collected generally for 1 to 3 hours. Samples for diacetyl were collected and analyzed using NIOSH Method 2557[NIOSH 1994  ppb), as were two of the three also sampled with the more sensitive draft NIOSH method using 1,2-phenylenediame-treated silica gel tubes (0.5 ppb limit of detection) -the detectable concentration was 0.9 ppb while using smoke flavoring.\nOf six area samples collected alongside cleaning operations with evacuated canisters for 2,3-pentanedione (1.2 to 2.9 ppb limits of detection) and 2,3-hexanedione (1.5 to 3.6 ppb limits of detection), one measured 2,3-pentanedione at 6.2 ppb and 2,3-hexanedione at 9.0 ppb during a nearly 3-hour cleaning procedure of cooking equipment containing strawberry cream cheese remnants while no cream cheese was being made in the room.\nThe snack food production plant applied powdered seasonings onto potato, corn, and tortilla chips after they were fried. Headspace analyses of bulk samples of seasonings found trace amounts of diacetyl, but no other alpha-diketone compounds, in four of the seven samples: barbeque, honey barbeque, cheddar sour cream, and chili cheese. Diacetyl, 2,3-pentanedione, and 2,3-hexanedione were not detected in the five 15-to 180-minute personal breathing zone evacuated canister air samples from processing line operators during nacho cheese tortilla chip production. The detection limits ranged from 2.8 to 6.0 ppb for diacetyl, 3.4 to 7.2 ppb for 2,3-pentanedione, and 3.2 to 6.8 ppb for 2,3-hexanedione. Although diacetyl was detected in three area samples collected instantaneously near the seasoning hopper, it was not quantifiable. Because it was found between the detectable level of 1.3 ppb and the quantifiable level of 4.3 ppb, the reported concentrations of 1.4 to 1.7 ppb are considered estimates. The area samples did not detect 2,3-pentanedione or 2,3-hexanedione (detection limits of 1.5 and 1.6 ppb, respectively).\nPersonal sample mean concentrations by location in the coffee plant were highest for employees working in the grinding/packaging room (93 ppb diacetyl, 53 ppb 2,3-pentanedione), flavoring room (80 ppb diacetyl, 122 ppb 2,3-pentanedione), production offices (81 ppb diacetyl, 22 ppb 2,3-pentanedione), all over (59 ppb diacetyl, 39 ppb 2,3-pentanedione), and housekeeping (54 ppb diacetyl, 18 ppb 2,3-pentanedione). These were followed by those in the roasting room (26 ppb diacetyl, 7 ppb 2,3-pentanedione), quality control room (24 ppb diacetyl, 11 ppb 2,3-pentanedione), warehouse (8 ppb diacetyl, <3 ppb 2,3-pentanedione), and nonproduction offices (7 ppb diacetyl, <3 ppb 2,3-pentanedione).\nThe mean area concentrations on the grinding/packaging and flavoring room mezzanines, where roasted whole and ground bean storage hoppers were located, were higher than those measured on the main production levels of the rooms. A 15-minute short-term air sample collected at the open hatch of a grinding/packaging room mezzanine hopper holding unflavored ground coffee above an active packaging line measured concentrations of 14,300 ppb diacetyl and 13,800 ppb 2,3-pentanedione. The location of the sample was representative of the proximity of employees' faces as they frequently and momentarily monitored coffee levels in the hoppers throughout their shift.\nNIOSH also conducted a small industrywide study at some flavored food production facilities where diacetyl and other food flavorings were added to various food products. Seventy-four personal and 105 area samples were collected for diacetyl using OSHA Method 1013. With one exception where local exhaust ventilation was documented in some locations, no engineering controls were noted in any facility. Of the 179 total samples, 12 had detectable levels of diacetyl (LOD 0.5 -1.0 ug/sample). The eight area samples ranged from 0.03 to 3.1 ppm, with three samples above 1 ppm (1.1, 2.1 and 3.1 ppm). The four personal samples ranged from 0.06 to 0.6 ppm .\n\n【35】 #OSHA Site Visits Related to Diacetyl and Flavorings that Contain Diacetyl\nBetween January 2008 and January 2010, an OSHA contractor measured diacetyl exposure to employees in a series of 12 industrial hygiene surveys at various facilities that use (11 facilities) or manufacture (1 facility) formulated flavorings, including flavorings that contain diacetyl ,Eastern Research Group 2008a, b, c, d, 2009a, b, c, d, e, 2010a. In the first two surveys, conducted in January 2008, diacetyl was measured using OSHA Method PV21\nIn the subsequent 10 surveys, OSHA Methods 1012 and 1013 were used. At all facilities, visual observation was made of engineering controls in place at the various operations evaluated.\nThe measured range of diacetyl concentrations are presented in  At the time of most of these field investigations, which preceded the California diacetyl regulation implemented in December 2010, little 2,3-pentanedione was being used for artificial butter flavoring. When food manufacturers began to request that diacetyl percentage be less than 1% of flavoring constituents, flavor manufacturers sometimes did not inform their clients of the substitution of 2,3-pentanedione and other diacetyl substitutes . Accordingly, populations with 2,3-pentanedione exposure without previous diacetyl exposure are difficult to identify. Thus, illness attributable to 2,3-pentanedione alone has not been studied.\n\n【36】 #Obstructive Lung Disease Consistent with Obliterative Bronchiolitis\nMost textbooks characterize obliterative bronchiolitis as a rare disease with airways obstruction, defined by a decreased FEV 1 and a decreased FEV 1 to FVC ratio on spirometry testing. The magnitude of decline in FEV 1 determines the severity of the disorder. However, three recent case series of biopsy-confirmed obliterative bronchiolitis document that many cases have normal spirometry and, when abnormal, the spirometric pattern can be restrictive, obstructive, or mixed restrictive and obstructive in nature . Because of the historical assumption that obliterative bronchiolitis is an obstructive disease, the early NIOSH investigations focused on obstructive abnormalities.\nAirways obstruction can occur in diseases such as smoking-related COPD (including emphysema and chronic bronchitis) and in asthma. In emphysema, the airways obstruction is usually FOOD PRODUCTION All three employees in a popcorn popping business developed symptoms of airways disease during their tenure; all were lifetime nonsmokers. One of the employees had significant reversible airways obstruction with some clinical evidence suggesting possible bronchiolitis obliterans in addition to asthma. FOOD PRODUCTION At a plant using a newly reformulated flavoring that included 2,3-pentanedione, no obstruction was identified in the 22 employees tested. Participants had higher than expected rates of shortness of breath, physician-diagnosed asthma, and a restrictive pattern on spirometry (four cases ranging from mild to moderately severe), compared to U.S. adults. Some participants reported symptoms with a workrelated pattern.\n\n【37】 #NIOSH\nF Three cross-sectional surveys, FOOD PREPARATION Studies of employees at three sites found higher prevalences of spirometric restriction, wheeze, dyspnea on exertion, nasal and eye irritation, and nasal allergies when compared to national rates. Cooks were 3-4 times more likely to report work-related respiratory symptoms. Fixed airways obstruction identified in two employees did not appear to be work-related.\n\n【38】 #NIOSH  D\nCross-sectional survey, FLAVORING MANUFACTURING This study of 34 employees found that bacterial products employees had higher prevalences of work-related eye symptoms and posthire skin problems than flavoring employees; both groups reported lower respiratory symptoms related to the substances they handled at work. One employee was identified with fixed airways obstruction and two employees with restriction on spirometry. NIOSH 2009a, clinical bronchiolitis obliterans , bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome , and flavoring-related bronchiolitis obliterans . Of the few surgical lung biopsies that have been performed in affected employees, some have been interpreted as showing evidence of \"constrictive bronchiolitis\" or \"obliterative bronchiolitis\" . The term fixed obstructive lung disease is the least specific of the terms. The term popcorn worker's lung refers to the population of employees in which the disease was first identified. The term flavorings-related lung disease refers to the full spectrum of lung diseases that may be related to flavorings exposure and is not necessarily limited to obstructive conditions, Terminology is complicated by the fact that, historically, researchers have applied the term \"bronchiolitis obliterans\" to different distinct disorders that involve the bronchioles ,\n\n【39】 #Bronchiolar Disease and Terminology\nBronchiolitis obliterans refers to disease processes that show some degree of inflammation, narrowing, or obliteration of small airways (bronchioles) in the lung . Historically, bronchiolitis obliterans has been classified into two groups: proliferative bronchiolitis obliterans and constrictive bronchiolitis obliterans . The disorder known as bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) is included in the proliferative group. BOOP is characterized pathologically by intraluminal polyps in the respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts, and alveolar spaces accompanied by organizing pneumonia in the more distal parenchyma. Clinically it is usually associated with diffuse alveolar opacities on chest x-ray and computed tomography scan; pulmonary function testing may show a restrictive defect . BOOP was first described in 1985. Prior to this, many cases that matched the description for BOOP were classified as idiopathic bronchiolitis obliterans . The American Thoracic Society and the European Respiratory Society have recommended the use of the term cryptogenic organizing pneumonitis (COP) instead of BOOP to avoid confusion with the disease constrictive bronchiolitis obliterans . While proliferative bronchiolitis can be idiopathic (e.g. COP), known associations include collagen vascular diseases (e.g. systemic lupus erythematosus), acute infections (e.g. influenza, mycoplasma), organ transplantation, and aspiration pneumonitis. Proliferative bronchiolitis is generally responsive to corticosteroid medications and is usually reversible .\nObliterative bronchiolitis (also referred to as constrictive bronchiolitis obliterans , constrictive bronchiolitis , and bronchiolitis obliterans ) is a rare disorder characterized by alterations in the walls of respiratory and membranous bronchioles that cause concentric narrowing or complete obliteration of the airway lumen, without involvement of the distal lung parenchyma by inflammation or organizing pneumonia . In affected individuals, pulmonary function tests usually show airways obstruction and hyperinflation , but biopsy-confirmed cases may have normal or restrictive spirometry . Chest x-rays may be normal or show hyperinflation, peripheral attenuation of the vascular markings, and nodular or reticular opacities  Cylindrical bronchiectasis is frequently associated with obliterative bronchiolitis; scans with both inspiratory and expiratory views are helpful because expiratory views are important in assessing air trapping . Identification of the obliterative bronchiolitis lesion on lung biopsy may be difficult because of its patchy distribution , often requiring step-sectioning and special staining to identify airway walls . The diagnosis is a multidisciplinary one involving a team with clinical, radiologic, and histopathologic expertise; HRCT evidence often replaces the need for surgical lung biopsy . In comparison to proliferative bronchiolitis, obliterative bronchiolitis is generally unresponsive to corticosteroid medications and often progresses to more severe disease , although progression after exposure cessation is not characteristic of flavoring-related disease consistent with obliterative bronchiolitis .\n\n【40】 Because of the difficulty of identifying the lesions of obliterative bronchiolitis on lung biopsy, and because the disease occurs commonly after heart-lung and lung transplants, in 1993 a committee sponsored by the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation proposed a clinical description for the disease termed bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome. The syndrome refers to graft deterioration secondary to persistent airflow obstruction as defined by pulmonary function changes with or without histolopathologic confirmation. Probable risk factors for BOS include acute graft rejection and cytomegalovirus pneumonitis . The term BOS has also been used in cases of obliterative bronchiolitis resulting from chemical injury and diagnosed using clinical criteria with or without biopsy Ghanei et al. 2004a; .\nInitial diagnoses received by these employees included pneumonia, asthma, emphysema, bronchitis, COPD, hay fever, and sinusitis. Five of the employees had minimal smoking history. All nine employees had been prescribed oral corticosteroids, but none had improvement in lung function. Five of the employees had been placed on lung transplant waiting lists by their personal physicians .\n\n【41】 #Index plant lung function testing\nThe NIOSH medical survey at the index microwave popcorn plant (Facility G) in November 2000 included lung function testing with spirometry and DL CO , chest x-rays, and a questionnaire NIOSH 2006. NIOSH compared the prevalences of respiratory symptoms, self-reported physiciandiagnosed asthma and chronic bronchitis, and airways obstruction on spirometry to data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) . Of 135 current employees, 117 (87%) completed the questionnaire, and 97 (83%) of the survey participants worked in the microwave popcorn production areas of the plant. The remaining 20 survey participants worked in areas where butter flavorings were not used such as plain kernel popcorn packaging, offices, warehouse, and outside receiving. The prevalences of respiratory and systemic symptoms, mucous membrane irritation, and skin irritation were higher among employees in microwave popcorn production areas than in other areas. Among all survey participants, the prevalences of chronic cough and shortness of breath when hurrying on level ground or walking up a slight hill were 2.6 times higher than expected; the prevalence of wheezing was three times higher than expected. The prevalences of self-reported physician-diagnosed asthma and chronic bronchitis were 1.8 and 2.1 times higher than expected, respectively. Of the 116 employees who underwent spirometry, 21 had airways obstruction, 3.3 times higher than expected. Airways obstruction in nonsmokers was 10.8 times higher than expected, and only two employees with airways obstruction had a significant response to administered bronchodilator. Five of six employees in the quality control (QC) laboratory had airways obstruction; these employees popped up to 100 bags of microwave popcorn in microwave ovens per employee per 8-hour work shift. Of the 115 survey participants who had an x-ray, 111 had no abnormalities, two had evidence of emphysema, one had saber-sheath tracheal narrowing attributable to COPD or tracheal stenosis, and one had focal upper-zone scarring and atelectasis at the left lung base. DL CO was normal in 96 of 103 employees tested, including all but one of those with airways obstruction.\n\n【42】 #Index plant environmental survey\nThe predominant VOC in the air of the plant was the butter flavoring compound diacetyl. All measurements above detectable limits (except where noted otherwise below) were subsequently corrected for underestimation inherent to NIOSH Method 2557 related to absolute humidity and days to extraction . The relative humidity and temperature measurements used for correction were available from in-facility area-specific and shift-specific measurements during all sampling, and sample-specific days to extraction were supplied by the laboratory. The mixing room had the highest mean air concentration of diacetyl (57.2 ppm); the next highest mean air concentration of diacetyl was in the packaging area for machine operators (2.8 ppm). The mean air concentration of diacetyl in the QC laboratory was 0.8 ppm, and for maintenance it was 0.9 ppm. The much higher prevalence of airways obstruction in QC employees, despite much lower average air concentrations of diacetyl, may reflect an enhanced risk of peak flavoring exposures when microwaved bags of popcorn product were opened; peak exposures were also likely present in maintenance employees and mixers.\nMean diacetyl air concentrations in other plant areas were less than 0.15 ppm,\n\n【43】 #Findings of index plant follow-up surveys\nNIOSH conducted seven follow-up medical and eight follow-up environmental surveys at the index microwave popcorn plant (Facility G) from 2001 to 2003 NIOSH 2006. These surveys were conducted to follow employee symptoms and lung function over time as exposures decreased with the implementation of engineering controls.\nNIOSH recommended a respiratory protection program for mixing room employees to minimize their exposures while engineering controls were being implemented; this program was initiated at the time of the November 2000 NIOSH survey. Starting in February 2001, the company began implementing several engineering controls to decrease air concentrations of flavoring compounds in the mixing room, the main source of air contaminants in the plant. An exhaust fan was installed in an outer wall of the mixing room to move contaminated air from this room to the outdoors and to maintain this room under negative air pressure relative to the rest of the plant. An air lock was installed at the entrance to the mixing room to further isolate the room from the rest of the plant. Local exhaust ventilation of the air space (headspace) above the contents of the heated flavoring tanks and the mixing tank in which flavorings are mixed into heated soybean oil was accomplished via ducts connecting the tank lids to the wall exhaust fan. A pump was installed to facilitate closed transfer of heated butter flavorings into the mixing tank. In 2002, the company constructed and began using a new mixing room that was more isolated from the packaging area than the original mixing room. In the packaging area, additional general dilution ventilation was implemented in 2001 along with local exhaust ventilation for seven heated holding tanks located on a mezzanine above the packaging lines that contained soybean oil and butter flavoring mixtures transferred via pipes from the mixing room,\nIn their analyses of data from the eight NIOSH medical surveys at Facility G from November 2000 to August 2003, NIOSH compared health outcomes in microwave popcorn production employees hired after the implementation of exposure controls to health outcomes in employees who had been working at the plant prior to the implementation of controls . For these analyses, investigators classified employees according to their hire date as follows: \"Group 1\" consisted of employees who were already working at the plant at the time of the November 2000 survey (i.e. before exposure controls were implemented), and \"Group 2\" consisted of employees who started work at the plant after the November 2000 survey (i.e. after exposure controls were implemented and exposures had declined). Because of a high turnover rate among employees hired after the November 2000 survey, participation in more than one medical survey was much higher in Group 1 , 100 Group 2 employees who participated in more than one survey worked in the packaging area. Therefore, for all Group 2 packaging area employees who participated in more than one survey, investigators compared symptoms and lung function on their first survey to their last survey results. In Group 1, the only statistically significant change in symptom prevalence over time was a decline in reported eye, nose, or throat irritation. There were no statistically significant changes in the prevalence of airways obstruction or in mean percent predicted FEV\nBased on data from employees' first surveys, packaging area employees in Group 2 had lower prevalences of respiratory symptoms and airways obstruction on spirometry, and mean percent predicted FEV 1 was significantly higher compared to packaging area employees in Group 1. All these differences were statistically significant except for usual cough. There were no statistically significant changes in the prevalences of symptoms, airways obstruction, or mean percent predicted FEV 1 from first to last survey in Group 2 packaging area employees . Of interest is that 47% of all employees with abnormal spirometry tested by NIOSH (in Groups 1 and 2) were asymptomatic.\nAt each plant, one to three employees per work shift (i.e. mixers) measured butter flavorings (liquids, pastes, and powders) in open containers such as 5-gallon buckets and poured the flavoring into heated soybean oil in large (e.g. 500-gallon) heated mixing tanks, most of which had loose-fitting lids.  Most mixers did not use respirators. Only one mixer at one plant reported consistent use of a respirator with organic vapor cartridges during mixing tasks.\nMixers added salt and coloring to the oil and flavoring mixture, which was then transferred by pipes to nearby packaging lines to be combined with kernel popcorn in microwaveable bags.  Employees on the packaging lines operated the packaging machines and facilitated the placement of the finished product into cartons and boxes.\nIn most plants, QC employees popped product in microwave ovens that were usually located in a separate QC laboratory. Other employees were located in warehouse and office areas. In separate areas of some plants, employees also packaged plain kernel popcorn in plastic bags without oil or flavorings. The six microwave popcorn plants differed in size as follows:\nNIOSH conducted analyses of aggregated data from the medical surveys conducted at the six microwave popcorn plants .\nOnly the data from the first survey at the index microwave popcorn plant were aggregated with the data from the surveys at the other plants.\n\n【44】 #Results of private surveys\nA large food company hired private consultants to conduct medical and environmental surveys at the company's four microwave popcorn plants . To assess for evidence of rapid lung function decline, the investigators identified employees with a progressive increase or decrease in FEV 1 of greater than 8% or 330 mL over 12 months among employees who participated in all three spirometry tests . They found no association between current diacetyl exposure (less than 0.05 ppm or greater than/ equal to 0.05 ppm) and a short-term persistent increase or decrease in FEV 1 , adjusted for pack-years of smoking and body mass index. Of 39 mixers with mixing experience before the implementation of mandatory PAPR use, five had airways obstruction. Three of the five had bronchodilator administered, and all three had a bronchodilator response\" Three mixers who began mixing after the implementation of mandatory PAPR use were found to have airways obstruction. Preplacement spirometry was not available for these individuals. One of the three employees had pre-existing asthma, and the other two had long smoking histories (24 and 63 pack-years, respectively). The investigators concluded that the airways obstruction in these three individuals was likely due to asthma and smoking but could not rule out the possibility that short-term exposure to diacetyl contributed to the airways obstruction when respirators had not been used 100% of the time.\nAnalyses of 6 years of spirometric follow-up of these four plant cohorts are pending. Management had required employees to wear respirators when weighing or adding the flavors or base ingredients to the mixers. However, employees did not always wear respirators during clean-up activities where exposure to powdered flavors was possible. NIOSH concluded that it was probable that some agent in the mixing room produced severe fixed obstructive lung disease in two employees. They did not identify a specific etiologic agent, but suspected an airborne agent because the lung was the only affected organ and because air sampling by the Indiana Division of Labor had revealed high dust exposures. The Indiana Division of Labor collected 20-minute air samples that showed dust air concentrations of 20 mg/m 3 in an employee's breathing zone and 2.5 mg/m 3 inside the hood of an employee's supplied-air respirator. NIOSH analyzed bulk ingredient samples for levels of proteolytic enzymes and endotoxin. They did not identify proteolytic activity in any of the samples; endotoxin levels were \"below levels seen in other workplaces where endotoxin has been associated with large decrements in FEV 1 \" . Air sampling for specific flavoring compounds was not conducted.\nA cluster of cases consistent with obliterative bronchiolitis among production employees at a flavoring manufacturing company was reported by Dr All five employees with these findings had normal spirometry tests at the start of employment. These employees went on to develop moderate to severe fixed airways obstruction. For 4 to 5 years after cessation of exposure to flavoring compounds, the affected employees had no further declines in their lung function, This prevalence was similar to that expected in comparison to national data from NHANES III . However, the distribution by severity of obstruction was highly skewed, with six mild cases, seven moderate, one severe, and the remaining four very severe. The prevalence of severe and very severe obstruction combined was 2.7 times higher than expected overall (95% CI 1.2-6.4) and 15 times higher than expected in employees less than 40 years old (95% CI 5. 1-44.1). Sixteen obstructed cases worked in four companies using ≥ 800 pounds of diacetyl annually compared to two obstructed cases in companies using less diacetyl (prevalence of 5.3% versus 1.2%), for an odds ratio  of 4.5 ,95% . The prevalence of obstruction in employees currently doing any production task was 4.5% compared to 2.0% in production support employees (laboratory technicians/scientists, quality control technicians, maintenance/repair employees, warehouse employees, and truck drivers) and 2.3% in office employees. Of the 18 employees with obstruction, 14 currently worked in production, two worked in production support (one had just moved from production because of dyspnea), one with previous production experience currently worked in the office, and one could not be classified. Tenure was statistically significantly higher in employees with moderate or worse obstruction than in employees with mild obstruction (1.5 versus 9.0 years; P = 0.02). Half of the 18 employees with obstruction reported no chest symptoms (five of six employees with mild obstruction and four of seven with moderate obstruction).\nOf the 13 with documented postbronchodilator spirometry, 12 had fixed obstruction (including all four with severe or very severe obstruction). Of the 12 of 18 with obstruction who had medical evaluation results submitted to the California Department of Public Health, eight were diagnosed by their physicians to have either bronchiolitis obliterans (one biopsy-confirmed) or fixed obstruction related to flavorings; all eight had moderate to very severe disease . Some of the cases included in this analysis of California flavoring employee surveillance data were presented above in the descriptions of two NIOSH HHEs at California flavoring plants (Facilities B and C).\n\n【45】 #Lung disease in diacetyl production employees\nLung disease consistent with obliterative bronchiolitis was reported among employees of a plant in the Netherlands that produced diacetyl .\n\n【46】 #Other food production case reports\nIn addition to cases consistent with obliterative bronchiolitis in flavoring manufacture, diacetyl manufacture, and microwave popcorn production, case reports have surfaced in other food production industries in which flavorings are introduced into food products.\nIn cookie manufacture with artificial butter flavoring in Brazil, four cases of bronchiolitis were described in young men, aged 24 to 27 years, who had worked between 1 and 3 years handling flavorings in preparation of cookie dough  .\n\n【47】 #Index Plant Findings Regarding Restriction\nAmong the former employees who developed findings consistent with obliterative bronchiolitis while working at the index microwave popcorn plant (Facility G), lung function tests in one employee showed a reduced total lung capacity and reduced residual volume in addition to airways obstruction. These reduced lung volumes indicate that this employee had restrictive lung disease as well as airways obstruction . This former employee also had a low carbon monoxide diffusing capacity and was unusual among the former employee cases in having some reversibility after ceasing employment at the microwave popcorn .\nIn the first cross-sectional survey of the index plant (Facility G), 10 of 116 employees had isolated abnormal FVC, of whom 7 had low total lung capacity; 11 employees had isolated airways obstruction. An additional 10 employees had both low FVC and airways obstruction, for a total of 21 of 116 employees having any restrictive spirometric pattern. None of those with any restriction had radiologic interstitial abnormalities. When the prevalence of any restrictive abnormality was examined by cumulative exposure quartile (using exposure estimates corrected for humidity and time to extraction), a trend for exposure response relationship was evident: From lowest to highest exposure quartile, the prevalence of any restriction was 10.7%, 13.3%, 20.7%, and 24.1% (P = 0.08). During follow up of these plant employees, one employee with rapidly falling pulmonary functions in a restrictive pattern underwent open lung biopsy. The pathology report documented caseating lung granulomas around airways, but grossly normal areas of lung were not sampled for examination of possible obliterative bronchiolitis. Cultures and stains for microorganisms did not yield an infectious etiology, and the physician concluded 3-2. In the three large microwave popcorn plants (Facilities G, K, and L), the restrictive proportion of abnormal spirometry ranged from 32.3% to 53.8%. These proportions are similar to those cited in two case series of biopsy-documented constrictive bronchiolitis, which were 50% in the case of U.S. soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan  and Iranians following sulfur mustard exposure, in which the pathology included proliferative bronchiolitis . In the three large microwave popcorn plants, the proportion of mixed restrictive and obstructive spirometry in those with abnormal spirometry was similar to the proportion with pure obstructive and pure restrictive abnormalities. In the consecutive clinical case series , the much lower proportion of restrictive abnormalities may be explained by the prevailing understanding a decade ago that obliterative bronchiolitis is an obstructive disease.\n\n【48】 #NIOSH Findings of Restrictive Spirometry at Flavoring Manufacturing Plants\nAs in the microwave popcorn investigations, flavoring manufacturing workforces with cases consistent with obliterative bronchiolitis have also had employees with restrictive spirometry, with proportions of restriction among those with abnormal spirometry ranging from 28.6% to 88.2% .\nNIOSH found an unusually high prevalence of a restrictive spirometric pattern among production employees at a flavoring manufacturing plant (Facility I) in Indiana . Among the 106 employees with interpretable spirometry test results obtained by the company, 30 (28%) had a restrictive pattern (22 with a mild abnormality, six with a moderate abnormality, one with a moderately severe abnormality, and one with a severe abnormality). In addition, three employees had obstructive abnormalities, and one had a very severe mixed abnormality. Combining all spirometric abnormalities with those with only excessive decline in FEV 1 in the subset of employees with serial abnormalities, 39 (37%) employees had abnormal findings. In comparison to the U.S. general population, the employee prevalence of restrictive spirometric abnormalities was 3.8 times higher than expected, after adjustment for race, ethnicity, sex, age, smoking status, and body mass index. NIOSH later detected an error in abstraction of smoking information from company spirometry reports and corrected this comparison to\nA company-sponsored re-analysis of Facility I spirometry data reported finding that no flavoring compounds, including diacetyl, had produced an increased risk of abnormal spirometric findings or longitudinal changes in spirometry . The study confirmed an excess risk of abnormal restrictive spirometry reported by NIOSH investigators with a similar prevalence ratio of  in comparison to the general population reflected in NHANES III. The authors offered the inadequacy of the NHANES III study population as a comparison group, despite adjusting for age, sex, and body mass index, because the national data were largely drawn from urban centers, and the authors alleged that the flavoring employees in a large city in Indiana were largely agrarian. As an alternative comparison group, the authors described the employee group with lower potential for flavoring exposure as an internal control group with no or minimal exposure, also referring to them as an administrative group. However, all employees in the medical surveillance program were in production areas, and company data documented measurable diacetyl in all production areas, including worrisome measurements in packaging which was classified in the NIOSH health hazard evaluation as having lower potential for exposure. Thus, the similar distribution of abnormal restrictive spirometry across the production workforce, without regard to higher and lower potential for flavoring exposure, remained unexplained and cannot be attributed to misclassification of lung disease by spirometry, variable quality spirometry, or body habitus, also mentioned by the authors. The most likely explanation for the 3.3-3.7 increased odds for restrictive disease in the Facility I workforce is that risk for workrelated abnormality existed across both groups of production area employees in comparison to the national predicted estimate.\nThe Ronk et al.  study conclusion that none of the flavoring compounds caused workrelated spirometric abnormalities hinges on absence of association of pulmonary function abnormalities or decrements in employees with tenure in higher potential for flavoring exposure areas. The authors explain the difference in findings between their \"negative\" study and the NIOSH findings of work-related spirometric abnormalities by a NIOSH methodologic flaw in not taking account of correlated measures of serial lung functions. However, the authors misrepresent NIOSH analyses in which the outcome variables were the slopes of spirometric changes, expressed as mL/ year, based on linear regression as a smoothing function. NIOSH also used categorical outcomes of excessive spirometric decline.\nNeither of these NIOSH outcomes reflected correlated serial data. In addressing serial (correlated) spirometry measures, Ronk et al.  used generalized estimating equation modeling, which is a reasonable approach. However, the authors chose an exchangeable correlation structure, which assumes that the variation between any two measures is equal; this assumption would not appear appropriate for pulmonary function test measures at varying intervals. Measures taken at a 6-month interval would likely be more correlated than measures at several-year intervals, as occurred in the Facility I spirometry data set. The generalized estimating equation models assume that cumulative tenure is linearly related to the change in spirometry measures, which may not be the case in a short-latency health effect as has occurred in flavoring-exposed employees. The Ronk et al.  paper omits report of average changes in FEV 1 and FVC per year in their model without workplace covariates, which might have indicated unusually high average decrements per year. NIOSH had found that the average FVC decline in the employee population was 108 mL/year, about 3.5-fold the expected decline of approximately 30 mL/year.\nRonk et al.  separately modeled tenure in work areas with higher potential for exposure and tenure in liquid compounding with the apparent assumption that the remainder of the plant population had zero tenure (exposure), which is simply false. In particular, the liquid compounding tenure model ignores tenure in other higher potential for exposure jobs, which would clearly result in no associations with their work parameters. In contrast, the simpler NIOSH analyses of decline in lung function by areas with higher and lower potential for flavoring exposure demonstrated that both average declines and excessive decline differed between the two groups of production employees in statistically significant ways. These simple methods were not affected by correlated measurements.\n\n【49】 #Rapid Lung Function Decline\nIndirect and direct evidence shows that employees exposed to flavoring-related compounds can experience excessive lung function decline, whether within the normal range of spirometry or in those with either restrictive or obstructive spirometric abnormalities. Indirect evidence comes from reviews of medical records and work histories of flavoring-exposed employees who developed obliterative bronchiolitis.\nIn a case series summarizing the eight affected former employees and one additional current employee at the index microwave popcorn plant (Facility G), the median length of employment prior to symptom onset was 1.5 years; the median duration of employment was 2 years . At a company that manufactured flavors for the baking industry (Facility A), two flavoring production employees developed respiratory symptoms and severe fixed airways obstruction within 7 months of starting work at the plant . Although these employees did not have baseline spirometry tests before they began working with flavorings, it is unlikely that their lung function was already significantly decreased when they started work. Production jobs such as preparing the oil and flavoring mixture for microwave popcorn production and mixing liquid and powder flavor ingredients in flavoring manufacture often require the employee to lift 50-to 100-pound containers. It is unlikely that employees could have performed such tasks if their lung function was already severely compromised when they started work. Some affected employees stopped working when they could no longer do the job because of severe shortness of breath on exertion, while others were relocated to less strenuous jobs .\nDirect evidence that employees exposed to flavoring-related compounds can experience rapid lung function decline comes from exposed employees who have had serial spirometry tests. Normal average FEV 1 decline is about 30 mL/year, and percent predicted FEV 1 does not usually change in the absence of disease because the predicted value is age corrected . Three of the affected former employees from the index microwave popcorn plant (Facility G) had declines in their FEV 1 percent of predicted of approximately 20% to 30% over approximately 2 years . NIOSH evaluated data from the eight NIOSH medical surveys at the index microwave popcorn plant for evidence of rapid lung function decline . The investigators chose as the criterion for rapid decline a decrease in FEV 1 of 300 mL and/or 10% from an employee's initial (baseline) spirometry test to the employee's last spirometry test. This criterion was similar to a threshold developed based on a study of coal miners evaluated over time with spirometry of high technical quality in which the researchers concluded that \"when healthy working males perform spirometry according to American Thoracic Society standards, a yearly decline in FEV 1 greater than 8% or 330 mL should not be considered normal…\" . The sensitive criterion used by the investigators, who did not annualize declines, was chosen because of the potential severity of the irreversible health outcome and the high technical quality of the pulmonary function tests, which allows for a sensitive cutpoint. For their analysis of the data from the surveys at the index microwave popcorn plant, investigators excluded survey participants with fewer than three interpretable spirometry tests because interpretation of change over time based on only two tests is less reliable .\nOf the 88 survey participants who participated in three or more NIOSH medical surveys at the index microwave popcorn plant (Facility G) and had started working there prior to the implementation of exposure controls (\"Group 1\"), 19 (22%) had FEV 1 declines of greater than 300 mL and/or 10% from their first to their last spirometry test. Four of these 19 employees had worked at some point in the mixing room, including one employee who experienced a 1,300-mL decline from the first test in November 2000 to the next test 5 months later; the next spirometry test 4 months after the second test showed an additional decline in FEV 1 of 600 mL, resulting in the employee leaving employment. This employee's FEV 1 continued to fall after leaving employment, with a total fall of 2,800 mL over 2.75 years, representing a decline from 96% of predicted FEV 1 to 39% of predicted FEV 1 . In comparison to survey participants who began working at the plant before the company started implementing exposure controls, only 3 (7%) of 41 survey participants with three or more spirometry tests who were hired after the company began implementing controls (\"Group 2\") had FEV 1 declines of greater than 300 mL and/or 10% from their first to their last spirometry test . Of the 27 Group 1 employees who participated in all eight medical surveys, mean annualized decline in FEV 1 in the first year of follow-up was 144 mL per year. Annualized decline in the second year of follow-up fell to 40 mL per year as exposures were controlled, and the annualized decline fell to 22 mL per year in the third year of follow-up, a rate of decline consistent with normal agingrelated lung function decline , In contrast, in a microwave popcorn manufacturing cohort studied over 12 months, no relationship was demonstrated between current exposure level (dichotomized at 0.05 ppm) and an abnormal decrease in FEV 1 (found in 7% of employees using a criterion of a greater than 320 mL or 8% decline over one year), adjusted for pack-years of smoking and body mass index . As indicated in the studies above, different approaches have been used by investigators over time to define excessive or rapid decline in FEV\n\n【50】 #Asthma\nAt the index microwave popcorn plant and at one of the other five microwave popcorn plants that NIOSH evaluated (Facilities G and L), the prevalence of self-reported physiciandiagnosed asthma was approximately two times higher than expected ,NIOSH 2004b,NIOSH , 2006. This suggests the possibility that some employees exposed to diacetyl and other flavoring compounds may be at increased risk for asthma (reversible airways obstruction) while others might be at risk for obliterative bronchiolitis (fixed airways obstruction)\nIt is possible that individuals with pre-existing asthma may experience an exacerbation of their asthma due to the irritant properties of diacetyl or similar vapors. Many asthmatics react nonspecifically with bronchospasm to strong odors. Diacetyl has been reported to be a sensitizer in a rodent local lymph node assay, and other diketones, including 2,3-pentanedione, 2,3-hexanedione, 3,4-hexanedione and 2,3-heptanedione, have similar potency as sensitizers\n\n【51】 #Dermatologic Effects\nOf the former employees who developed findings consistent with obliterative bronchiolitis while working at the index microwave popcorn plant (Facility G), one employee also developed a severe skin rash\n\n【52】 #Discussion\nMedical evaluations of employees who have developed progressive shortness of breath while working at several microwave popcorn plants and flavoring plants have shown findings consistent with the severe irreversible lung disease obliterative bronchiolitis. Some affected employees have experienced extremely rapid declines in lung function, with severe airways obstruction occurring within several months of the start of exposure to flavoring compounds NIOSH 1986. Whether restrictive lung disease is part of the spectrum of obliterative bronchiolitis in flavoring-exposed employees remains incompletely evaluated, although restrictive spirometry has been a common finding; in one plant, excessive FEV 1 declines in a restrictive pattern appear to be associated with potential for flavorings exposure. Employees as young as 22 years old have been affected by obstructive disease. Some affected employees have been placed on lung transplant waiting lists by their physicians because of the severity of their disease , and some flavoring-exposed employees have received lung transplants. The findings from investigations and studies conducted at multiple plants have revealed a link between exposure to diacetyl and risk for severe occupational lung disease.\nThese findings meet the criteria that are often used to determine if the results of multiple studies indicate that an exposure is the likely cause of specific health effects .\nThe first of these criteria is temporality: the exposure precedes disease development.\nEvidence of this comes from the many instances where initially asymptomatic diacetyl-exposed employees developed progressive shortness of breath within months of starting work and then were found to have severe fixed airways obstruction NIOSH 1986;. Additionally, NIOSH documented rapid falls in lung function in exposed employees with initially normal spirometry at three plants . California public health surveillance showed that excessive FEV 1 decline occurred in employees in flavor manufacturing plants that participated in a preventive program attempting to lower flavoring exposures .\nTemporality requires the exposure to precede disease development, and the inverse is that new disease cases should decline in a population with cessation of exposure, an evaluation by intervention or \"experiment\". Follow-up medical and environmental surveys at the index microwave popcorn plant (Facility G) revealed evidence of decreased lung disease risk with control of exposures Additionally, among 27 employees who participated in all eight NIOSH medical surveys from 2000 to 2003, annualized declines in FEV 1 improved from 144 mL per year to 40 mL per year to 22 mL per year, the last being consistent with normal aging-related lung function decline . Similarly, the former employee index cases with clinical bronchiolitis obliterans had stable FEV 1 within about 2 years of exposure cessation .\nAnother criterion is strength of the association: the magnitude of the apparent health risk due to the exposure. In analyses of data from the initial NIOSH medical survey at the index microwave popcorn plant (Facility G), the prevalence of airways obstruction among nonsmoking current employees was approximately 11 times higher than expected in comparison to national data from NHANES III. It was approximately three times higher than expected in older smokers . In analyses of California flavoring employee surveillance data, the prevalence of severe airways obstruction was approximately three times higher than expected among all employees compared to national data. The prevalence in employees less than 40 years old was 15 times higher than expected .\nConsistency is also supported by the occurrence of lung disease consistent with obliterative bronchiolitis in diacetyl-exposed employees in at least eight flavoring manufacturing plants, a diacetyl production plant, a cookie manufacturing plant, and a coffee production plant CDC 2007;Kim et al. 2010;NIOSH 1986NIOSH , 2007aNIOSH , 2008; . Private consultants who conducted medical and environmental surveys at four microwave popcorn plants owned by one large food company also found in their data analyses that a history of working as a mixer and higher cumulative exposure to diacetyl were associated with decreased lung function .\nAdditional criteria to support a causal link between diacetyl exposure and severe lung disease include biologic plausibility, doseresponse relationship, and consideration of alternate explanations.\nNIOSH found evidence of a dose-response relationship (i.e. worse lung disease or more employees affected with higher diacetyl exposure) in analyses of medical survey data from the index microwave popcorn plant (Facility G) and in analyses of aggregated data from medical surveys at the index plant and five additional microwave popcorn plants. The analyses of data from the initial survey at the index plant showed an increasing prevalence of abnormal spirometry with increasing quartiles of estimated cumulative diacetyl exposure . Analyses of aggregated data from surveys at the six microwave popcorn plants showed higher prevalences of respiratory symptoms and worse lung function in mixers with more than 12 months experience and in packaging area employees at plants where heated tanks of oil and flavorings were not adequately isolated, compared to less exposed comparison groups . Additional evidence of a dose-response relationship was found in analyses of California flavoring employee surveillance data. An analysis of obstruction by amount of plant diacetyl use showed that there were 16 employees with obstruction in four companies that used more than 800 pounds of diacetyl annually compared to two employees with obstruction in companies that used less diacetyl (prevalence of 5.3% versus 1.2%), for an  of 4.5 (95% CI 1.03-19.9) .\nIn diacetyl-exposed employees with severe fixed airways obstruction and other findings of obliterative bronchiolitis, a consideration of alternate explanations should take into account the fact that while obstructive lung diseases such as asthma and smoking-related emphysema are common in the general population, severe airways obstruction is rare, especially in young individuals. Asthma is characterized by episodes of reversible airways obstructionsome individuals with severe or inadequately treated asthma can develop fixed airways obstruction. However, asthma does not appear to be a possible explanation for cases of severe lung disease among diacetyl-exposed employees for the following reasons:\nMost affected employees denied having any pre-existing lung disease or symptoms at the start of exposure.  Once shortness of breath developed, it did not improve when employees were away from the workplace as would be expected in employees with occupational asthma (either new onset asthma or exacerbation of pre-existing asthma).  Employees' illnesses did not improve when they took medications for asthma such as bronchodilators and corticosteroids.  Most employees did not have a significant response to administration of bronchodilators in any of their spirometry tests (i.e. airways obstruction was fixed).\nWhile some diacetyl-exposed employees who developed severe lung disease were smokers, the natural history of smoking-related disease and the results of medical evaluations of affected employees make it unlikely that the cases of severe fixed airways obstruction among diacetyl-exposed employees are smoking-related. Compared to the normal decline in lung function that occurs with aging (FEV 1 declines approximately 30 mL/year), in a subset of smokers lung function declines more rapidly (FEV 1 declines on average approximately 45-70 mL/year). An estimated 10%-15% of all smokers develop clinically important airflow obstruction . Smokers who experience rapid lung function decline will typically start to become short of breath once their FEV 1 falls below 60% of predicted; this usually occurs around age 50. Severe airways obstruction (e.g. FEV 1 less than 40% predicted) typically does not occur before 55-60 years of age . Several diacetyl-exposed employees developed severe fixed airways obstruction while still in their 20s and 30s. Any smoking history among these affected employees (as well as in affected employees younger than 50) would not explain their severe fixed airways obstruction. Additional evidence against smoking as a cause of severe lung disease in these employees is the fact that most employees' DL CO measurements were normal. In airways obstruction due to smoking-related emphysema, DL CO is reduced.\nObliterative bronchiolitis is known to occur as a result of a variety of infections, exposures, or nonpulmonary diseases. Examples include overexposure to highly irritating gases or vapors such as chlorine, ammonia, and nitrogen oxides or in association with connective tissue diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis, or in organ transplant recipients. The diacetyl-exposed employees who developed severe fixed airways obstruction did not have histories or medical evaluation findings to suggest that they had developed obliterative bronchiolitis from another exposure or medical conditiong. copious sputum in someone with bronchiectasis or evidence of upper airway obstruction on spirometry. Such findings were not apparent in diacetyl-exposed employees who developed severe fixed airways obstruction.\nInvestigations of severe lung disease consistent with obliterative bronchiolitis among diacetylexposed employees have provided substantial evidence of a causal relationship between diacetyl exposure and development of this disease. Exposure preceded disease development, and lung disease risk decreased with control of exposures. Analyses of data from workplace medical and environmental surveys revealed a strong, consistent association of the disease with diacetyl manufacture, use of diacetyl in flavoring production, and use of diacetyl-containing butter flavorings in microwave popcorn production. The investigations have also shown evidence of a dose-response effect, and animal and other laboratory studies have provided evidence of biologic plausibility. Medical evaluations of affected employees did not identify alternative explanations for their illness besides their workplace exposure to diacetyl and other flavoring compounds. Accordingly, the criteria for interpreting epidemiologic associations as causal have all been met by the body of investigation presented in this criteria document for a recommended standard.\nAlleman T, Darcey DJ .

Constrictive (obliterative) bronchiolitis: diagnosis, etiology, and a critical review of the literature.\nThus, existing studies indicate that diacetyl is a reactive compound that can modify proteins and suggest that diacetyl-associated protein modification may occur in vivo.\n\n【54】 #Diacetyl and 2,3-Pentanedione in Food\nDiacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione have a long history as components of food, suggesting that exposures can occur in diverse workplaces. They occur as natural products in many foods . Diacetyl imparts the flavor and aroma of butter to many common foods and drinks including butter, cheese, yogurt, beer, and wine . Diacetyl in food plays an important role in food preference .\nWhile less extensively studied in foods than diacetyl, 2,3-pentanedione is a common flavoring in margarine and vegetable spreads . Roasted coffee also contains appreciable amounts of diacetyl . Because diacetyl is not a component of green coffee beans, it appears to be a product of the roasting process .\nBacteria and yeast produce diacetyl during fermentation . It can be produced by metabolism of an acetaldehyde-thiamine pyrophosphate complex in the presence of acetyl-coenzyme A . Microbes can also produce diacetyl from pyruvate in the presence of acetyl-coenzyme A .\nMicrobial culture conditions, such as pH, can influence the relative amount of diacetyl produced during fermentation . In addition, the steam distillate of several bacterial cultures grown on skim milk is known as \"starter distillate\" and is also considered a flavoring . Major components of some starter distillate samples include diacetyl and acetic acid . A recent study demonstrated that diacetyl remains a frequent component of commercial starter distillate samples, and diacetyl concentrations exceeded 20 mg/g in one sample .\nStarter distillate can also contain 2,3-pentanedione as well as butyric acid, which inhibits the metabolism of diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione . Thus, diacetyl and 2,3-penanedione can occur naturally in food, may be added to food as flavorings, may be produced during the roasting process, and can be anticipated components when starter distillate is added as a flavoring.\n\n【55】 #Metabolism in Mammalian Cells\nIn the rat and hamster liver, diacetyl is metabolized principally by reduction to acetoin in an enzymatic reaction catalyzed by dicarbonyl/Lxylulose reductase (DCXR), the enzyme is also known as diacetyl reductase, with either nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) as coenzymes . Acetoin can be further reduced to 2,3-butanediol in an NADH-dependent manner . This diacetyl reductase activity is higher in the liver than in the kidney, and kidney activity is higher than in the brain. However, after oral administration of diacetyl, the levels of acetoin are much higher in the brain than in the kidney or liver. 2,3-Butanediol accumulates in liver, kidney, and brain after the administration of diacetyl, acetoin, or 2,3-butanediol. Oral administration of acetoin and, to a lesser extent, 2,3-butanediol, in rats also causes diacetyl accumulation in the liver and brain . However, liver homogenates do not produce significant diacetyl from acetoin or 2, 3-butanediol . Thus, the metabolic interconversion of the 4-carbon compounds, acetoin, diacetyl, and 2,3-butanediol occurs in mammalian systems in vivo and in vitro but the full spectrum of metabolic pathways remains incompletely investigated.\nAs mentioned above, in mammalian cells, the predominant metabolic pathway for diacetyl is catalyzed by DCXR, a tetrameric protein that is comprised of four subunits, each 244 amino acids long . In addition to the reductive metabolism of diacetyl, DCXR catalyzes the metabolism of several other dicarbonyl compounds, including 2,3-pentanedione, 2,3-hexanedione, 2,3-heptanedione, and 3,4-hexanedione . In addition, DCXR catalyzes the reductive metabolism of a number of monosaccharides, including L-xylulose, and plays a role in the glucuronic acid/uronate cycle of glucose metabolism as well as the metabolism of carbonyl compounds . Inhibitors of DCXR are well described and include n-butyric acid, 2-furoic acid, benzoic acid, and nicotinic acid . At least one of these DCXR inhibitors, n-butyric acid, is well absorbed in the nose, and its presence in vapor mixtures causes small but significant decreases in diacetyl absorption in the nasal mucosa and, thereby, leaves more diacetyl in the vapor stream of the nasal airways for delivery to the lung .\nOccupational Exposure to Diacetyl and 2,3-Pentanedione  81 4 . Toxicology of Diacetyl and 2,3-Pentanedione Very weak tracheal contractions with threshold at 1 mM, relaxation at exposures above 3 mM. Diacetyl effect on response to intraluminal (mucosal) methacholine:\n4-hour perfusion with 3 mM diacetyl increased methacholine reactivity 10 times; 10 mM diacetyl completely inhibited the methacholine response. Depolarization of transepithelial potential difference at 3 and 10 mM. Decrease in transepithelial potential difference at 10 mM.\nGloede et al.  F344 rats Respiratory uptake of diacetyl in F344 rats was used to validate a model of respiratory tract uptake of diacetyl At a given inhaled diacetyl dose, the predicted dose to the bronchiolar epithelium of a lightly exercising employee is predicted to be more than 40 times the dose to the bronchiole of a rat. Describes a low affinity, high capacity and a high affinity, low capacity pathway for diacetyl metabolism in the rat respiratory epithelium. The high affinity pathway is inhibited by sodium benzoate, indicating that it is DCXR.\nMale and female Wistar-Han rats and B6C3F1 mice 2,3-Pentanedione 0, 50, 100 or 200 ppm 6 hr/day, 5 days/week, Up to 12 exposures In rats, 12-day 2,3-pentanedione exposure cause necrosis of respiratory epithelium and atrophy of olfactory neuroepithelium in the nose; intramural and intraluminal fibrosis of intrapulmonary airways.\nIn rats, 5 or 10 days of inhaling 200 ppm 2,3-pentanedione increased bronchoalveolar lavage fluid concentrations of monocyte chemotactic protein-1, monocyte chemotactic protein-3, C-reactive protein, fibroblast growth factor-9, and fibrinogen. In mice, 12-day 2,3-pentanedione exposure caused necrosis of nasal turbinates, suppurative exudate and atrophy of olfactory neuroepithelium in the nose; inflammation in intrapulmonary airways with necrosis, ulceration and regeneration at 200 ppm exposure.\nMorris and Hubbs  Male Sprague-Dawley rats Diacetyl 100 or 300 ppm in airstream flows of 100-400 mL/min A hybrid computational fluid dynamic-physiologically based pharmacokinetic model (CFD-PBPK) was used to extrapolate diacetyl and butyric acid uptake in rat airways epithelium to human airways epithelium. The CFD-PBPK suggests that nasal injury in rats can predict a risk to deep lung tissue in humans. Diacetyl damages airway epithelium when it reaches a critical concentration in the target cells; the CFD-PBPK indicates that more diacetyl will be absorbed in the nose of rats than in humans. Butyric acid is shown to shift diacetyl absorption from the nose and trachea into deeper lung tissue.  In the rat kidney, DCXR is localized in the distal tubules and collecting ducts and colocalizes with carboxylmethyllysine, an advanced glycation end product . In the mouse kidney, DCXR is localized to the brush border of the proximal renal tubules . In the human prostate epithelial cells and in normal human skin, DCXR is associated with the cell membrane . In human skin, DCXR is located near the adhesion molecules, e-cadherin and β-catenin .\nSimilarly, in the vascular endothelium in the dermis, DCXR localizes near intercellular junctions, suggesting a potential role for DCXR in cell adhesion . In addition, DCXR activity is present in the respiratory mucosa of the rat, with the highest activity in the olfactory epithelium . DCXR knockout mice are not well characterized phenotypically but are reported to be fertile . People without DCXR excrete pentose in their urine but are otherwise believed to be healthy, indicating that DCXR and the major diacetyl metabolic pathway are not essential for life . Importantly, the metabolism of diacetyl is not exclusively by DCXR. For example, aldo-keto reductase 1C15 is a newly-described aldoketo reductase expressed in rat lung that can metabolize α-diketones .\nRecently, a low affinity, high capacity and a high affinity, low capacity pathway for diacetyl metabolism have been described in the respiratory tract of the rat . The high affinity pathway was inhibited by sodium benzoate indicating that it is DCXR. The low affinity pathway is not believed to play a major role at diacetyl concentrations associated with most occupational exposures.\n\n【56】 #In Vivo and in Vitro Toxicology Studies\nDiacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione may be consumed in food, the vapors may be inhaled, and direct skin contact is possible. In vivo studies have modeled these routes of human exposure.\n\n【57】 #In Vivo Toxicology of Orally Administered Diacetyl\nSubchronic (90-day) gavage administration of 540 mg diacetyl/kg/day caused multiple changes in exposed rats, including decreased body weight, increased water consumption, increased adrenal weight, increased relative kidney and liver weights (in females absolute kidney and liver weights were also increased), decreased blood hemoglobin concentration and gastric ulceration . No adverse effects were noted at the next highest dose level, which was 90 mg/kg/day. On a mg/ kg basis, the 90 mg/kg/level was estimated to be roughly 500-fold greater than the estimated human maximum daily intake of diacetyl from foods consumed at that time, with 50 ppm diacetyl being the highest estimated concentration in any food .\n\n【58】 #Effects of Topically Applied Diacetyl and 2,3-Pentanedione in Vivo\nSensitization following topical application of diacetyl is predicted on the basis of results of a murine local lymph node assay .\nOn the basis of the results of the local lymph node assay and immune cell phenotyping, it is suggested that diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione function as T-cell mediated chemical sensitizers . Cutaneous sensitization by diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione may be initiated through haptenation with proteins containing the amino acids lysine and arginine . Diacetyl is corrosive to the cornea of the eye using the Draise test .\n\n【59】 #Toxicology of Inhaled Diacetyl in Vivo\nIn rats, acute exposures to diacetyl or diacetylcontaining butter flavoring vapors cause necrosis in the epithelial lining of nasal and pulmonary airways. Rats inhaling vapors of butter flavoring that contained diacetyl developed multifocal necrotizing bronchitis one day after a 6-hour exposure. The mainstem bronchus was the most affected intrapulmonary airway. However, nasal airways were more affected than intrapulmonary airways. Necrosuppurative rhinitis was seen in rats inhaling butter flavoring vapors at concentrations of butter flavoring that did not cause damage in intrapulmonary airways . As a single agent acute exposure in rats, a 6-hour diacetyl inhalation exposure caused epithelial necrosis and inflammation in bronchi at concentrations of > 294.6 ppm and caused epithelial necrosis and inflammation in the trachea and larynx at concentrations of ≥224 ppm . The airway epithelial damage in rats inhaling 356 ppm was remarkable, with an average pathology score of 9.5 on a 10-point scale in the nasopharyngeal duct and larynx, while damage in the tracheal epithelium averaged 8.7 on a 10-point scale. In a pattern reminiscent of airway damage from butter flavoring vapors, diacetyl causes greater damage to nasal airways than to intrapulmonary airways . The data from the National Toxicology Program 90-day inhalation study are available online and was used for the NIOSH animal-based risk assessment .\nAirway damage in mice one day after diacetyl inhalation was found to correlate with markers of increased protein turnover, implicating protein damage in the etiology of diacetylinduced airway damage .\nEighteen hours after a 6-hour exposure to inhaled diacetyl  were not affected.\nFollowing inhalation of 346 ppm diacetyl by rats, foci in the trachea that demonstrate epithelial denudation also appear to have loss of sensory nerves, as reflected in a decreased density of PGP9.5-immunoreactive nerve fibers. However, in the epithelium adjacent to denuded foci, increased numbers of nerve fibers contain immunoreactive substance P, a neuropeptide important in neurogenic airway inflammation.\nExposing mice to diacetyl for only 1 hour/day at 100, 200, or 400 ppm diacetyl, 5 days per week, for 2 to 4 weeks rather than 6 hours/day for the same number of days eliminated epithelial necrosis in mice inhaling 200 ppm diacetyl and decreased the severity of epithelial necrosis in mice inhaling 400 ppm diacetyl. Lymphocytic inflammation was seen around the bronchi in some mice inhaling 100 ppm and in all mice inhaling 200 or 400 ppm diacetyl . Exposing mice to diacetyl for 15 minutes per day at 1,200 ppm diacetyl, 5 days/week for 2 weeks also caused lymphocytic infiltrates around bronchi, and lymphocytic infiltrates extended deeper into the lung, reaching the level of the preterminal bronchioles .\nSubchronic, 12-week, diacetyl inhalation for 6 hours/day, 5 days/week caused significant histopathologic changes in mice at all concentrations studied. Peribronchial lymphocytic infiltrates were seen at terminal sacrifice at 12 weeks in all subchronically-exposed mice inhaling 100 ppm diacetyl and in some mice inhaling 25 or 50 ppm diacetyl. In mice inhaling 100 ppm diacetyl, bronchial epithelial changes included denudation, attenuation, and hyperplasia . Chronic active nasal inflammation was seen in all mice inhaling 50 or 100 ppm and in four of five mice inhaling 25 ppm diacetyl for 12 weeks, an exposure that also caused minimal to mild lymphocytic bronchitis in two of five mice. This suggests that the no observable adverse effect level in mice for subchronic inhalation may be less than 25 ppm diacetyl.\nButyric acid caused a small but significant reduction in nasal uptake of diacetyl in the rat nose, and, thereby, increased the diacetyl exposure to the lung due to a reduced \"scrubbing\" effect .\nOropharyngeal aspiration permits exposures that bypass the rodent nose and, hence, scrubbing at that site . A single aspiration exposure to 400 mg/kg diacetyl produced a fibrohistiocytic response at the bronchioloalveolar junction of mice after 4 days. While oropharyngeal aspiration of diacetyl delivers a high bolus dose of diacetyl, the unusual fibrohistiocytic response could suggest that the smallest airways may be particularly susceptible to diacetyl-induced epithelial injury and fibrosis .\nA subsequent study demonstrates development of obliterative bronchiolitis in rats after intratracheal instillation of diacetyl . In this model, diacetyl-induced obliterative bronchiolitis was associated with abnormal repair of the injured bronchiolar epithelium.\nPulmonary function changes have been investigated in mice after acute or subchronic diacetyl exposure. In mice, acute 2-hour diacetyl inhalation at concentrations from 191 to 1154 ppm caused a decrease in respiratory rate and an increase in the \"time of break\" between inhalation and exhalation, an indicator of sensory irritation . In addition, acute diacetyl inhalation in mice caused decreases in tidal volume and mid-expiratory flow rate. Mice previously exposed to high diacetyl concentrations were less sensitive to the sensory irritation effects of a diacetyl challenge exposure, while mice previously exposed to low diacetyl concentrations were more sensitive to a diacetyl challenge exposure. Extrapolation of the mouse dose-response relationship to humans suggested no sensory irritation to warn employees during acute diacetyl exposures at concentrations less than 20 ppm . As mentioned earlier, a recent study suggests that acute diacetyl inhalation exposures can actually increase the number of substance P-positive neurons in the jugular ganglia and the number of nerve fibers containing substance P in the epithelium adjacent to sites of epithelial damage, but decreases the sensory innervation at the actual sites of greatest epithelial damage . As a group, these studies suggest dysregulation of airway sensory innervation and responses. Additional studies support the potential for diacetyl to alter pulmonary function in exposed rodents. Mice inhaling 100 ppm diacetyl for 12 weeks had concentration-dependent decreases in respiratory rate and minute volume after 3 and 6 weeks of exposure; mice inhaling 50 ppm diacetyl had decreased respiratory rates after 6 weeks exposure, but pulmonary function improved with time with continued exposure at these concentrations . However, after 18 weeks of exposure, respiratory rates in mice inhaling 25 ppm diacetyl were significantly lower than in controls .\nThe effects of diacetyl inhalation may not be limited to the respiratory tract. Inhaling 2,500 ppm diacetyl for 45 minutes increased 2-deoxyglucose uptake in foci in the posterior portion of the rat brain olfactory bulb . While this finding has generally been interpreted as being related to olfaction , the potential exists for toxicity to olfactory neurons that radiate into the olfactory bulb. Phagocytosis of olfactory nerve material and increases in Tnfα mRNA were recently demonstrated in the olfactory bulb of mice one day after a 6-hr diacetyl inhalation exposure. By immunofluorescence, the multifunctional scaffolding protein sequestosome-1 accumulated in the olfactory bulb of these mice and often congregated in the microglial cells that contained phagocytized olfactory neuronal material .\nAlthough powdered butter flavoring can produce fewer vapors than liquid butter flavorings, the powders have a major respirable component .\nIf powdered butter flavorings are substituted for liquid butter flavorings, diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione vapor concentrations may well be below exposure limits. In particular, encapsulated flavoring powders are designed to contain diacetyl or 2,3-pentanedione vapors. However, inhalable particulates can be deposited in the nose, the conducting airways, and deep lung.\nNo peer reviewed studies have investigated the potential for encapsulated flavorings to release diacetyl and/or 2,3-pentanedione directly to the target cells lining airways. However, a recent study indicates that more than a quarter of particulates in flavoring powders are less than 10 μm in diameter. Therefore, powders have the potential to reach the intrapulmonary airways .\n\n【60】 #In Vitro Toxicology of Diacetyl and 2,3-Pentanedione\nDiacetyl is mutagenic in the Salmonella typhimurium tester strains TA100 and TA104 . However, diacetyl also reacts with mutagenic heterocyclic amines and suppresses the mutagenicity of heterocyclic amines in Salmonella typhimurium tester strain TA98. Diacetyl also enhances chromosome loss by proprionitrile in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Recently, diacetyl in the presence of human S9 demonstrated a high degree of mutagenicity in a mouse lymphoma mutation assay . Consistent with these findings, recent in vitro studies of direct interactions between diacetyl and single-stranded oligonucleotides under acellular conditions indicate that diacetyl can form adducts with 2-deoxyguanosine . Additional studies on the genotoxicity of diacetyl have been reviewed in the background documents available online as part of the National Toxicology Program .\nIn isolated mitochondria, diacetyl closes the mitochondrial permeability transition pore and renders it insensitive to Ca 2+ . This effect of diacetyl occurs at concentrations that could occur in tissues of diacetyl-exposed individuals, with half-maximal inhibition of the mitochondrial transition reported to be at a diacetyl concentration of 1 mM . This concentration has been shown to have pharmacological activity in airways and has been modeled to be achieved in the airway wall after inhalation . The effect of diacetyl on the mitochondrial permeability transition pore appears to be caused by arginine modification  . In addition, diacetyl can be metabolized by pig heart mitochondrial pyruvate kinase to form acetate and acetyl-CoA with a K m value of 0.46 mM. Diacetyl is also a competitive inhibitor of pyruvate metabolism by pyruvate dehydrogenase with a K i of 0.43 mM .\nThe isolated, perfused trachea system employing tracheas from unexposed guinea pigs has been used to investigate the effects of diacetyl in vitro . In this model, the direct, potentially toxic effects of the agent on epithelium may be examined. Agents such as diacetyl may be applied to the epithelium (mucosal surface) or separately to the smooth muscle (serosal surface) of the trachea while measuring contractile or relaxant responses of the airway smooth muscle. An advantage of this model is that the effects of the diketone do not involve an inflammatory response, inasmuch as the trachea has been removed from the animal and there is no source for the recruitment of inflammatory cells into the wall of the airway.\nInvestigation of inhaled diacetyl effects  on reactivity of tracheas removed from exposed rats and studied in the isolated, perfused trachea model showed that reactivity to methacholine applied to the mucosal surface was increased slightly after inhalation of 300 and 360 ppm diacetyl and 320 and 360 ppm 2,3-pentanedione. Based on epithelial damage in airways after exposure to diacetyl, a larger increase in airway reactivity had been anticipated .\nDamage to the epithelium after diacetyl inhalation suggests that epithelial ion transport and electrical resistance could be affected by the diketone. In rat tracheal segments investigated in vitro with Ussing chambers, diacetyl dissolved in physiological salt solution at 3 mM decreased transepithelial potential difference (V t , mV), indicative of a decrease in electrogenic ion transport and/or an effect on paracellular ion transport involving tight junctions, whereas 10 mM diacetyl reduced V t further and decreased transepithelial resistance (R t , Ωcm 2 ). R t is an index of tight junction permeability. Thus, ion transport and epithelial integrity are affected directly by diacetyl.\nThe mechanism(s) of the effects of diacetyl on trachea in vitro are not known at present. However, a related structure, 2,3-butanedione monixime, has been reported to inhibit contraction of smooth muscle, perhaps as a result of inhibiting phosphorylation of myosin light chains . Bioelectric responses of neurons also have been reported to be inhibited by 2,3-butanedione monixime .\n2,3-Pentanedione is not mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, TA102, or TA1\nA recent study demonstrates that in vitro diacetyl exposure increases shedding of the epidermal growth factor ligand, amphiregulin. These findings are further supported by evidence that amphiregulin transcripts and protein are also increased in an in vivo model of obliterative bronchiolitis induced by repeated intratracheal instillation of diacetyl . Amphiregulin has previously been reported to play a role in pulmonary fibrosis, although the nature of that role is not fully understood .\n\n【61】 #Toxicology of Inhaled Diacetyl Substitutes\nDiacetyl is the compound largely responsible for the flavor of butter in butter . However, exposures in workplaces that make or use butter flavoring and emissions from heated butter flavoring involve multiple volatile compounds . Among the potential replacements for diacetyl, starter mix contains high concentrations of diacetyl . Another chemical that adds the flavor of butter to food is acetoin, and it was present along with diacetyl in many of the workplaces where obliterative bronchiolitis occurred in employees who make or use diacetyl ; .\nAcetoin is structurally very similar to diacetyl but an α-hydroxyketone in acetoin replaces the reactive α-diketone implicated in the toxicity of diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione .. In addition acetoin (150 ppm), after inhalation for 6 hours by rats, had no effect on reactivity to inhaled methacholine while inhaled acetic acid (27 ppm for 6 hours), another component of flavoring mixture, increased airway reactivity to methacholine . Thus, current data, while limited, indicate that acetoin is considerably less hazardous than diacetyl.\n2,3-Pentanedione is structurally very similar to diacetyl because it is a 5-carbon α-diketone, and diacetyl is a 4-carbon α-diketone. Eighteen hours after a 6-hour inhalation exposure to 2,3-pentanedione , R L and C dyn in anesthetized rats were unaffected . Subsequently, airway reactivity to inhaled methacholine aerosol was decreased after inhalation of 120, 240, and 320 ppm 2,3-pentanedione. 2,3-Pentanedione affected methacholine reactivity more than diacetyl. Airway hyperreactivity to methacholine had been anticipated, in view of the epithelium damage caused by the flavoring.\nFollowing inhalation exposure of rats to these same concentrations of 2,3-pentanedione and perfusion of the trachea in vitro, reactivity to mucosally-applied methacholine was increased by 240, 320, and 360 ppm 2,3-pentanedione . The magnitude of this effect surpassed that caused by diacetyl inhalation.\nMorphologic data suggest that 2,3-pentanedione can cause airway epithelial damage similar to the damage caused by diacetyl . Rats repeatedly inhaling 2,3-pentanedione at concentrations ≥ 150 ppm for up to 2 weeks develop fibrosis of intrapulmonary airways, a morphologic change similar to obliterative bronchiolitis in humans . Recently, more than 3500 genes were found to be upregulated in RNA isolated from the fibrotic bronchi of 2,3-pentanedione exposed rats . Some of the up-regulated genes were ones previously implicated in fibrosis, including transforming growth factor-β2, interleukin-1α, interleukin-18, interleukin-33, and fibronectin. In addition, at high exposure concentrations, messenger RNA changes were noted in the brain of rats after acute 2,3-pentanedione inhalation .\n\n【62】 #Diacetyl and 2,3-Pentanedione in Cigarette Smoke\nA recent study suggests that mainstream tobacco smoke collected by a smoking machine contained significant amounts of diacetyl that varied with the smoking parameters set by different organizations.  2006;Polzin et al. 2007. Other recent studies have identified diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione in electronic cigarette liquids and aerosols .\nHowever, that study did not use a smoking machine to simulate actual smoking behavior, so that the amount of diacetyl observed may not be representative of the amount produced under realistic smoking conditions. In another study, using GC/MS and a smoking machine with ISO parameters, a range of 12.7-145 µg diacetyl/cigarette was measured from 41 different types of cigarettes . Thus, several studies suggest that significant diacetyl is present in mainstream cigarette smoke, although the concentrations vary . Finally, electronic cigarette liquids often contain diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione .\nThe Pierce et al.  1975. Assuming that all of the air an employee inhales contains the concentration of diacetyl measured in the workplace, it is critical to recognize that the mainstream smoke of a smoker is not the only source of air; they are also breathing air with much lower diacetyl concentrations.\nAssuming that the other air breathed by smokers does not contain diacetyl, the workplace equivalent exposure concentration for a smoker during the smoking time period is roughly 190-to 560fold lower than the concentration measured in the mainstream cigarette smoke using the ISO parameters of one 0.035 L puff/min (6.75/0.035 is 193 and 19.5/.035 is 557). Using the ISO parameters, this would be an average equivalent of a workplace concentration of 0.45 to 1.3 ppm for diacetyl and 58 to 170 ppb for 2,3-pentanedione during the smoking process. If the smoking machine parameters of 9.3 minutes/cigarette are used to calculate the duration of exposure, a smoker who smokes one pack of 20 cigarettes/ day spends 186 minutes a day smoking, but the employee is working for 8 hours. Therefore, the 8-hour time-weighted average equivalent concentration for the smoker is 2.6-fold lower to reflect the time period they are not exposed, which would be 170 to 500 ppb for diacetyl and 22 to 65 ppb for 2,3-pentanedione, depending upon exercise level.\nCalculations of workplace equivalent exposures are similar using total mass of diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione reported by Pierce et al.\nthese concentrations of diacetyl would be predicted to decrease FEV 1 in some individuals if inhaled for a working lifetime . Indeed, many smokers do demonstrate significant decreases in FEV 1 . Additionally, cigarette smoking is a major risk factor for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and a decrease in FEV 1 is a characteristic feature of this disease. In addition, bronchiolar fibrosis is part of the airway remodeling response that characterizes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . Decreases in FEV 1 and fibrosis of bronchioles are features that also characterize obliterative bronchiolitis . However, smokers with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease have additional morphologic changes in their lungs, including emphysema, that are not seen in obliterative bronchiolitis . While it has been hypothesized that the failure to diagnose diacetyl-induced obliterative bronchiolitis as a cigarette smoker-associated disease suggests that diacetyl does not cause obliterative bronchiolitis in exposed employees , the data when corrected for the actual corresponding occupational exposure concentrations may instead suggest the hypothesis that diacetyl and related reactive carbonyl compounds in cigarettes could potentially contribute to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Because chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality , the role of diacetyl and other reactive carbonyl compounds in cigarette smoke in contributing to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a worthy topic for future studies.\nMost importantly, because diacetyl causes obstructive lung disease and because smoking causes obstructive lung disease, the presence of diacetyl in cigarette smoke does not diminish the need to control diacetyl exposures in employees. In fact, it highlights the greater risks occurring in employees who are exposed to diacetyl in the workplace and who also smoke.\n\n【63】 #Relevance of Diacetyl Animal Studies to Humans\nFour converging lines of evidence support the relevance of diacetyl inhalation studies in rats and mice to humans. First, diacetyl inhalation causes damage to respiratory epithelium in rats and mice. This finding is important because injury to the respiratory epithelium of the deep lung is the accepted cause for obliterative bronchiolitis. Second, dosimetry calculations indicate that diacetyl concentration in respiratory epithelium of the human deep lung under working conditions may be much higher than diacetyl concentrations in laboratory animals. Third, another organic compound, sulfur mustard, implicated in causing obliterative bronchiolitis in humans, produces a similar pattern of predominantly nasal injury in rats exposed by nose-only inhalation . Fourth, repeated inhalation exposure to 2,3-pentanedione causes fibrosis of intrapulmonary airways . Each of these findings supports the conclusion that with appropriate dosimetry studies, damage to the respiratory epithelium of the upper airways of rodents should be considered when evaluating risk for humans.\nAnimal exposure studies have revealed that the upper airways of rodents are sensitive to flavoring-induced toxicity, whereas the lower airways of humans are most affected by these agents. Importantly, diacetyl exposures in rodents caused extensive damage to the respiratory epithelium lining the nose and the trachea . The cell types that are injured in the nose and trachea in rodents are very similar to the respiratory epithelium lining the airways of the deep lung of humans that are involved pathophysiologically in the development of obliterative bronchiolitis . In addition, the bronchi were damaged at high concentrations in acute exposures and at lower concentrations in subchronic exposures in mice. Thus, inhalation toxicology studies showed that diacetyl could damage respiratory epithelium, providing biological plausibility for its etiologic role in obliterative bronchiolitis. Indeed, at the time of the first inhalation toxicology studies of diacetyl, no accepted cause of obliterative bronchiolitis in humans had been demonstrated to cause obliterative bronchiolitis in rodents. Recently, repeated inhalation exposures to 2,3-pentanedione have been shown to cause fibrosis of intrapulmonary airways in rats, demonstrating a pathologic change in the rodent model that is very similar to obliterative bronchiolitis in humans . Interpretation of the species difference in the anatomic location of diacetyl-induced damage to respiratory epithelium may be explained by species differences in respiratory tract anatomy, breathing patterns, and diacetyl dosimetry.\nRodents are obligate nasal breathers while humans are oronasal breathers. Inhaled air may bypass the human nose, particularly during exertion . In addition, the rodent nasal passageways and the rodent trachea are much narrower than the corresponding human nasal passageways and trachea. Small airway diameter increases the percentage of the airstream that is in contact with the mucous layer, increases resistance, and thereby increases mucosal absorption of watersoluble vapors . Thus, the dimensions of the rodent nose predict much greater absorption of diacetyl vapors in the rodent than in the human nose. However, the surface area of the airways within the human lung is 100 times greater than the surface area of airways in the rat lung . These anatomic differences predict that, at a given exposure concentration, the mucosa in the rodent nose receives a much higher diacetyl dose than does the human nose and that the human lung receives a much higher dose than the rodent lung.\nDamage to the nose of rodents has recently been described for another agent implicated in causing obliterative bronchiolitis in humans, sulfur mustard , a chemical warfare agent. Obliterative bronchiolitis is considered a major cause of progressive respiratory disease in survivors of sulfur mustard exposure . Noseonly inhalation exposures of F344 rats to sulfur mustard caused severe mucosal damage in the rat nose but the changes in the lung were absent or minimal . When the nose was bypassed using intubation with tubing lined by Teflon, sulfur mustard did indeed cause necrosis of the epithelium lining the proximal airways . This suggests that sulfur mustard, an accepted cause of obliterative bronchiolitis in humans, causes a similar pattern of injury to the pattern observed with diacetyl at different levels of the respiratory tract of rodents. Thus, predominantly nasal injury has been seen in rodent inhalation studies with organic agents implicated in causing obliterative bronchiolitis.\n\n【64】 #Conclusions\nInhalation toxicity studies in rats and mice, and in vitro studies in guinea pig tracheal preparations, indicate that diacetyl-containing butter flavoring vapors can damage airway epithelium and cause inflammation in the respiratory tract after acute or subchronic exposure. In addition, in vivo local lymph node assays indicate that diacetyl is a sensitizer, and in vitro studies indicate that diacetyl is mutagenic. Diacetyl can react with arginine residues causing structural changes in proteins that influence the function of the altered proteins. These functional changes in proteins include changes in enzyme activity and the mitochondrial permeability pore. Pharmacologic studies in vitro indicate that diacetyl can alter ion transport and reduce epithelial integrity. CFD-PBPK modeling indicates that diacetyl concentrations in the deep airways of humans may be higher than those in laboratory rodents, explaining the tendency for diacetyl-induced airway damage to be more anterior in the respiratory tract of rodents than in humans. Most recently, studies of the related α-diketone, 2,3-pentanedione, suggest that the airway toxicity of diacetyl may be shared with other structurally related, α-diketones, and that inhalation of either diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione can cause airway fibrosis in rats.\n\n【65】 Aeschbacher HU, Wolleb U, Loliger J, Spadone JC, Liardon R .

This sampling identified a number of air contaminants in addition to diacetyl and acetoin , including acetaldehyde. Problems in diacetyl sample determination with NIOSH Method 2557 related to humidity at the time of sampling and the elapsed time to sample extraction were subsequently uncovered. NIOSH researchers worked extensively to understand this problem and derive an appropriate correction for estimating diacetyl levels . This correction, based on absolute humidity and time to extraction, was applied to the diacetyl exposure levels above the limit of detection (LOD) as measured in the selected HHEs. For other chemical exposures in microwave popcorn production determined using NIOSH Method 2557, such as acetoin, no humidity/extraction correction was needed.\nUnique exposure time periods were developed for each of the eight exposure categories to reflect impact of the exposure control changes implemented at the plant from November 2000 to July 2003. Within the time periods for each JEM exposure category, exposures were assumed to be constant. Exposure estimates in the JEM were assigned to employees based on their history of jobs performed, job duration, and the calendar time period. For work history prior to the first industrial hygiene survey, exposure estimates from the first time period were used. For some employees such as those in the mixers exposure category, the measured personal diacetyl exposure was adjusted for the use of respirators in selected exposure periods .\nProblems in the retrospective exposure assessment for diacetyl include  uncertainty over when diacetyl was introduced and on the extent of its use as a flavoring component over time (and therefore on employee exposure levels),  variation in diacetyl content across different product lines over time,  the relative presence of diacetyl as a vapor vs. mist, adsorbed to powders or encapsulated, and  seasonal variation in the role of natural ventilation. Cumulative exposure and other exposure metrics were calculated starting at the dates when diacetyl was estimated to have first been used in regular production at the four plants: Company K (July 1, 1988), Company L (January 1, 1994), Company G (July 1, 1986), and Company N (July 1, 1986). These dates are uncertain, particularly for Company N.\n\n【67】 #Work History\nThe employees studied were current employees at time of survey except at Company G where some former employees were also examined. All results presented are for current employees except at Company G where, due to repeated pulmonary testing over months or years, initially current employees could become former employees at a subsequent survey. Participation was voluntary and generally quite high among current employees (66%-91%) ,  successive periods in specific department and job title assignments with corresponding beginning and ending dates. Gaps in employment were treated as unexposed and not included in duration-of-exposure measures.\n\n【68】 #Outcomes\nReported symptoms and PFT results defined the HHE outcomes Sustained-symptom onset dates were also collected. Spirometry testing was performed following ATS guidelines . The predicted and lower limit of normal  was the starting choice for exposure metric, but dose-rate effects were examined by calculating the time summation of the square root or square of diacetyl concentration corresponding respectively to diminishing and increasing marginal responses to increasing exposure intensity (dose-rate effects) as follows: cum(DA) = Σ i (DA), cum(DA 0.5 ) = Σ i (DA 0.5 ) , and cum(DA 2.0 ) = Σ i (DA 2.0 ) where the summation was over calendar days.\nTransformed cumulative exposures as the square root, square, or logarithm were evaluated as were duration of exposure and average exposure concentration (cumulative exposure/ duration of exposure). Peak exposures were not available from full-shift (8-hour) TWA concentrations although selected jobs had been analyzed using a real-time method (FTIR) to assess time-variability. To make full use of the serial spirometry determinations at Company G, a longitudinal analysis of ppFEV 1 was performed in which exposure metrics were calculated from time of first diacetyl exposure up to the time of each successive spirometry determination. This analysis included employees with two or more spirometry results. All employees were active at their first survey but could have left employment prior to a subsequent survey. These models were fit using PROC MIXED in SAS 9.2  with random effects permitted for individual employee's intercepts and exposure responses. A second set of metrics was calculated with exposure cumulation starting at the time of an employee's first survey and used in a subsidiary longitudinal analysis along with the full cumulative exposure metric. This analysis permitted a test of homogeneity, i.e.  for exposure effects before and after the first survey and  for possible survivor bias.\nPooled analyses were conducted for two plant populations (Company K, L) with similar reported average exposures and estimated exposure responses. A plant effect was introduced to allow for systematic differences between the two sites, and there was a test of heterogeneity in the exposure effects.\n\n【69】 #Models of the Incidence of Pulmonary Obstruction\nFor analyses of onset of discrete adverse effect outcomes, conducted for the Company G population (n=361), three case-definitions of pulmonary impairment were applied:\n(  -6 ) and  performing considerably better than exposure duration alone, and with average exposure to diacetyl  and Cum(DA 2.0 ) performing less well than duration . The estimate for the exposure-response with Cum(DA) was a 0.50 reduction in ppFEV 1 for each ppm-year of cumulative exposure . (After 1 year at 1 ppm an employee's ppFEV 1 , starting at 100, would be predicted to be 99.5.) For FEV 1 /FVC the percent reduction with 1 ppm-yr DA was\nSeventy-nine percent of the cross-sectional study population (n=286) had duration of employment of < 4 yr and 49% had less than 6 months, reflecting a high workforce turnover rate. Models restricted to < 4 yr duration produced considerably larger effect estimates; for ppFEV 1 : −1.07 (vs. −0.50) and for FEV 1 / FVC: −0.87 (vs. −0.16) . With < 4 yr, the metric was a less strong predictor than Cum(DA).\nIn the models with the better predicting exposure metrics, gender and ethnicity (possible indicators of differential healthy employee selection) were unimportant predictors\nBy far the highest exposures at Company G were among mixers  raising the possibility that the observed losses in pulmonary function could be limited to that group. To examine this question, the basic multiple regression models  were applied to the population at Plant G from which all employees who were ever mixers had been excluded. The result was slightly stronger estimates of the DA effect both for  the linear cumulative exposure term (β=0.61 vs. 0.50 for full population; R 2 =0.182 vs. 0.169, resp.) and  the square root of cumulative exposure (β=3.02 vs. 2.75 for full population; R 2 =0.182 vs. 0.173, respectively) (results not shown).\nAnother concern was the possibility of a diacetyl-smoking interaction, with smoking possibly enhancing the harmful effect of diacetyl. Models for ppFEV 1 and FEV 1 / FVC including interaction terms (products of the diacetyl exposure metrics with the ever-smoking and pack-yrs terms) yielded statistically significant protective effects of ever-smoking on the linear and square root cumulative diacetyl exposures and small, mostly insignificant, additive interactions for the pack-years × diacetyl metric terms (P = 0.04 -0.25 depending on exposure metric and outcome; data not shown). In the absence of the smoking interaction terms, the diacetyl effects in non-smokers are somewhat underestimated and overestimated in smokers.\nAcetoin is another exposure in the popcorn flavoring environment (typically present with diacetyl in flavoring additive packages), and its presence was strongly associated with diacetyl (corr = 0.85) at Plant G, but it is not subject to the humidity degradation problem in air sampling. In response to concerns that the corrected historical exposure measurements for diacetyl were inaccurate, NIOSH repeated models of exposure-response relationships using acetoin measures. Applying to acetoin the procedure used for constructing the exposure matrix for diacetyl resulted in estimated acetoin concentrations over employees' work histories. Multiple linear regressions predicting percent of predicted FEV 1 based on acetoin exposure metrics produced the same pattern of results as observed with diacetyl and with almost identical model fit. For the metric square root of cumulative exposure, the R 2 observed was 0.1743 and 0.1737, respectively, for acetoin and diacetyl; the t-statistics for the exposure terms were 5.09 and 5.06 respectively. In microwave production jobs at Plant G, the mean DA concentration over all sampling surveys, combining both area and personal samples, was 3.4 ppm compared with 0.28 ppm for acetoin determinations from the same air samples. Because there is little support for acetoin itself playing a major role other than as surrogate for diacetyl in pulmonary toxicity, and because acetoin was present at much lower concentrations, this result supports the validity of the diacetyl exposure assessment and subsequent findings, but also implies that the diacetyl effects are being underestimated as a result of misclassification, otherwise the diacetyl effects would produce a stronger model fit than acetoin.  5-7, 5-8; the effects remain statistically significant. Differences in the effects of employees' exposures accruing from their initial evaluation (their first survey) until the current survey, compared to all exposures prior to the current survey, using either the metric Cum(DA) or , were small and not statistically significant (P > 0.7) . This supports the conclusion that bias arising from cases preferentially leaving employment prior to the first survey is not different from that following the first survey when exposures were declining, suggesting that the bias in estimating the decline in ppFEV 1 is not large.\n\n【70】 #Incidence of Pulmonary\nImpairment at Company G\n\n【71】 #Evidence of Variable Susceptibility to Diacetyl Effects\n\n【72】 Of the 36 cases, 22 occurred in the first 4 years of exposed employment, which encompassed about 80% of the study population. The rapid onset of this disease has been reported CDC 2007;Israel et al. 2009;NIOSH 2006NIOSH , 2008. Examination of onset graphically (data not shown) also suggested that many cases arose after relatively short employment duration. A similar pattern was exhibited in the 46 cases (defn 1) identified among former employees (no longer employed at the time of their first survey) (data not shown). The predicted baseline incidence (from the model with diacetyl exposure set = 0) in the same array , with a term of the form  2 ×exp(−0.69 × Duration), i.e. halflife of 1 year and squared average exposure, produced a significant fit ,LRT=7.97, 2df, p=.\n\n【73】 #Interpretation of Modeling Results\nMultiple linear regression models of continuous spirometry outcomes at Company G reveal that both cum(DA) and are the preferred predictors of FEV 1 decline based on model fit. Average exposure was the weakest predictor of ppFEV 1 . Subsidiary analyses indicate that  a dose-rate effect, if present, is small and negative (i.e. effects are not limited to high exposures);\nbias arising from possible removal of earlier cases was probably small, and  the bias introduced by the correction procedure addressing degradation of diacetyl air samples is also small although possibly resulting in underestimation of the diacetyl effect. Evidence for non uniform susceptibility includes the somewhat superior prediction by compared to Cum(DA) which may be a reflection of a reduced response in the population at longer durations of exposure.\nIn the modeling of incidence, fewer cases met the third case definition than the first or second (19 vs. 36, 27) due to the requirement that both ppFEV 1 and FEV 1 /FVC be less than their LLofN. This was consistent with some restriction as was observed in regression models of FVC (data not shown). Using the third case definition, the estimated baseline rate is very small ; baseline annual rate = 0.007% per year (365.25× exp(−15.48)=0.00007), indicating that virtually all cases were attributable to either diacetyl exposure or smoking. The strong association with the term representing short duration of exposure supports the conjecture that the population with \"normal\" susceptibility was declining by about half with each 2 years of exposure duration. Although average diacetyl exposure by itself is a strong predictor of incidence, as with prediction of FEV 1 /FVC, this appears to be an artifact of changing population susceptibility and has little biological plausibility as a risk factor itself.\nThe existence of a changing population composition with respect to susceptibility poses a challenge for predicting excess cases over a 45-year working lifetime because the composition of the population with respect to the factor(s) conveying risk is unknown and workforce turnover continually introduces a higher-risk segment into employment. (more typical employment durations and implying a larger workforce ever exposed). The nominal standard for acceptable risk used was one per thousand excess risk of impairment, a standard choice used in OSHA regulation for chronic diseases.\n\n【74】 #Methods\nFor continuously distributed respiratory endpoints such as FEV 1 , the benchmark dose approach permits estimation of excess prevalence of impairment as a function of prior exposure history . On the basis of regression models and population data on the distribution of FEV 1 from NHANES III , the proportions of the workforce predicted to be impaired after working at specified exposure levels can be calculated. Unlike animal-based studies where exposures are in discrete levels, the analyses here utilized continuously distributed exposure metrics and a linear statistical model which made unnecessary the point-of-departure procedure commonly used in benchmark dose calculations. This method, however, does require specification of what degree of deficit constitutes impairment and the maximum increase in impairment prevalence that is considered acceptable, which are policy choices.\nThe exposure resulting in a maximum allowable increase in impairment over some time period is called the benchmark dose (BMD).\n\n【75】 #Risk assessment with percent predicted FEV 1 and FEV 1 /FVC\nWith the conventional benchmark dose procedure, the excess prevalence of an adverse condition is calculated using an exposureresponse relationship derived from modeling.\nWith the linear regression result for percent predicted FEV 1 and Cum(DA) ,coef.=−\nFor impairment defined in relation to LLofN as opposed to some fixed threshold such as the 5th percentile of ppFEV 1 , the BMD procedure is less direct because LLofN is specific to age, height, gender and race. The distribution of various functions of FEV 1 and LLofN, such as FEV 1 /LLofN or (FEV 1 -LLofN)/(ppFEV 1 -LLofN) are not readily specifiable. An alternate approach was taken: in the NHANES population , the cumulative exposure (Cum(DA)) that would reduce an individual's FEV 1 to their LLofN was calculated using the exposure-response estimates from the preferred regression models of ppFEV 1 ,coef.=-0.50,\n\n【76】 #Methods\n\n【77】 On the question of exposure uncertainties prior to the NIOSH surveys, particularly the date when widespread diacetyl exposures commenced at Company G, analyses specifying different years for the start of exposures suggested that the optimum starting year was about 1994 instead of 1986, but this assumption had only a small impact on the estimated exposure response because most employees surveyed were hired after 19\nIn constructing the exposure matrix for the plants studied, the decision was made not to apply the humidity correction for air samples below the LOD. To determine if this choice affected the analytical results, analyses were repeated having applied the correction to all air samples. The resulting difference in parameter estimate for the model of percent predicted FEV 1 with the cumulative exposure term was very small: −0.500 vs. −0.499. For the metric, square root of cumulative exposure, the parameter estimate is slightly larger when samples < LOD are corrected: −2.77 (uncorrected) vs. −2.82 (corrected). For the models of FEV 1 /FVC there was no change.\nTherefore there was no impact on risk estimates which were based on these parameter estimates.\nSeveral alternate explanations were considered for the apparent variability in susceptibility:\nThe proportion of Hispanic employees was higher among the short duration cases: Hispanics also comprised a higher proportion among recent hires and the cross-sectional surveys tended to reflect more recent employees due to high turnover.\nBias from candidate cases lacking styptom onset: using the date of their first qualifying spirometry would tend to increase rather than decrease the estimate of duration of exposure until onset and thus would not account for the short-duration cases.\nRecall bias on symptom onset: employees with fast onset probably estimated symptom onset in relation to hire date, which is generally precisely known, not in relation to survey date. For example, an employee with 3 years employment probably would recall that symptoms began after about 6 months on the job, not 2.5 years ago.  Jobs with peak exposures would favor an early onset: this would happen only if the cumulative exposure metric was underestimating the relevant exposure. This could occur with a positive dose-rate effect, but what was observed was, if anything, a negative dose-rate effect  where summing the square root of air concentrations over time was a much better predictor than summing the square of concentrations. Serious exposure misclassification could cause a pattern indistinguishable from variable susceptibility; employees whose exposures were substantially underestimated would appear to respond more strongly (faster) with adverse health effects and conversely for employees whose exposures are overestimated. However, the \"high risk\" cases were not largely associated with specific job groups such as mixers or quality control; many came from the general production line, and excluding mixers did not reduce affect estimates. Undoubtedly misclassification was present but a systematic discrepancy in risk by a factor of 10, as observed between the short and long duration groups and others arising from misclassification is implausible.\nIn summary, these sensitivity analyses substantiated the parameters, variables, and assumptions used in the final risk assessment and provide confidence in the risk estimates.\n\n【78】 #Discussion\nThe NIOSH HHE investigations in popcorn manufacturing were not specifically designed for quantitative risk assessment and have limitations in terms of unknown selection of study subjects and limited historical exposure information. Nonetheless, these observations of diacetyl-exposed employees have proved useful for risk assessment. The likelihood that the Company G population represents a survivor cohort together with the relatively high participation rate implies that underestimation of effects has probably resulted. Further underestimation has resulted from exclusion of asymptomatic cases in the analyses of incidence. Acting against bias from selection of a surviving population and missing cases is the possibility that participants may have included a more than representative proportion of cases. However, the high participation rate (~80%) limits this potential participation bias.\nAppropriate in the risk assessment and development of the REL for diacetyl is consideration that the health effects should be viewed in the complementary contexts of an individual employee's risk of impairment which is the clinician's measure of impact, and the risk incurred by the population of employees with diacetyl exposure. The American Thoracic Society, in a statement on the effects of air pollution, concluded that shifts in the respiratory health of a population, resulting from some exposure, that diminish individual reserve function, are adverse \"even in the absence of the immediate occurrence of frank illness\" . In the clinical context, if an employee's FEV 1 /FVC is less than 0.7 (or FEV 1 less than or equal to 80%), that would be considered mild COPD . Similarly, if diacetyl exposure decreases the mean pulmonary function of the exposed population by some small increment, this too could be considered an adverse event .\nThe health significance of small spirometry changes, such as a 1% decline in FEV 1 after 2 years of exposure at 1 ppm diacetyl, depends partly on whether such changes are early indications of lung pathology that eventually would manifest as obliterative bronchiolitis.\nIn studies of obliterative bronchiolitis arising from lung transplantation, unrelenting irreversible FEV 1 decrements are observed that ultimately lead to the diagnosis of obliterative bronchiolitis and fatal disease . However, incomplete knowledge concerning the natural history of obliterative bronchiolitis development with diacetyl exposure is a limitation in the present risk assessment. Not only is risk for mortality increased, as estimated in this risk assessment, quality of life is degraded  and risk is increased for cardiovascular disease and progressive respiratory disease . The decrease in FEV 1 predicted after working for 10 years in diacetyl exposures of 0.2 ppm (about 1% loss) is comparable to changes observed in children, a more vulnerable population, exposed to levels of air pollution that lead to clinical impairment in later life .\nVariation in susceptibility poses issues for risk assessment. If less-susceptible individuals are remaining in employment longer, the estimated exposure response for long durations when applied to a hypothetical population of 1,000 employees employed 45 years, will generate excess risk values that understate the true risk of a workforce that turns over more often.\nAll of the risk assessment procedures used here assume some degree of low-dose linearity, with effects diminishing proportionally with decreasing exposure levels that are held constant over 10 or 45 years. Model linearity was observed particularly after limiting the population to < 4 yr duration. Moreover a significant fraction of career-average exposures fell below 0.01 ppm (17% of employees) a factor of only 2.0 higher than the proposed REL. Thus low-dose extrapolation was limited. Below 0.01 ppm, there can be some significant departure from linearity although diversity in response would tend to favor linearity to lower levels .\n\n【79】 #Conclusion\nExcess prevalence (BMD) and lifetime risk estimates variously derived for 45 years of diacetyl exposure were similar, based on Company G analyses . Impairment has been defined here as pulmonary function falling below the lower limit of normal. The BMD estimates for excess prevalence of FEV 1 impairment are within a factor of 2.0 of the life- Dose-response data for diacetyl toxicity in laboratory animals are available, and there are limited but useful animal data on the toxicity of 2,3-pentanedione. For 2,3-pentanedione, NIOSH has conducted a comparative potency analysis, comparing the toxicity of inhaled 2,3-pentanedione to that of diacetyl. These quantitative risk assessments are described below.\nLaboratory animal studies designed to evaluate the effects of exposure to butter flavoring vapor or of diacetyl alone have demonstrated a relationship between exposure and respiratory effects. In rats exposed by inhalation to butter flavoring vapor for 6 hours (diacetyl concentrations ranged from 203 to 352 ppm), rhinitis (at the lowest exposure concentration) and bronchitis (at the higher two exposure concentrations) were observed one day after exposure . In a follow-up study rats were exposed by inhalation to diacetyl (intermittently or continuously for up to 6 hours), which resulted in various adverse respiratory effects including epithelial necrosis and inflammation in the nose, larynx, trachea, and bronchi . The nasal region was observed to be the most sensitive.  reported similar adverse respiratory effects in mice exposed by inhalation to diacetyl for up to 12 weeks. Adverse nasal and lung effects were observed with the latter found in the bronchial, peribronchial, and peribronchiolar regions.\nThe NTP has issued findings from a 90-day inhalation study of diacetyl in both mice and rats . Adverse effects were observed in the nose, larynx, trachea, and bronchi in mice and rats. Because the 2011 NTP study had the longest exposure durations among all experimental animal studies, included two species, and used more animals per dose group than the  study, it was used in the doseresponse analysis to BMDs, the lower bound on the BMDs (BMDLs), and corresponding human equivalent concentrations (HECs), as discussed below.\n\n【80】 #2,3-Pentanedione\nHistopathological data from repeatedexposure inhalation toxicology studies with 2,3-pentanedione were first published in 2012, but are limited to 2-week exposures using small numbers of animals . Although these data are limited, it is possible to compare the toxicity produced by 2,3-pentanedione to that produced by diacetyl under similar conditions, and thus estimate the potency of 2,3-pentanedione relative to diacetyl. Therefore, the limited toxicological data for 2,3-pentanedione are not used directly to establish a REL for 2,3-pentanedione, but only to develop an estimate of the toxic potency of 2,3-pentanedione relative to that of diacetyl. Like diacetyl, 2,3-pentanedione is a reactive alpha-dicarbonyl compound that can damage protein . Recently, bronchial fibrosis has been documented in rats inhaling either 2,3-pentanedione or diacetyl for 2 weeks .\n\n【81】 #Diacetyl\nThe response data that were analyzed were obtained from the experimental study reported by the NTP . Male and female Wistar-Han rats and male and female B6C3F 1 hybrid mice were exposed to diacetyl vapors at concentrations of 6.25, 12.5, 25, 60, and 100 ppm, 6 hours per day, 5 days per week, for 13 weeks. The microscopic evaluations of tissues from the larynx, lung, nose, and trachea described whether or not one or more lesions were detected, the types of lesions that were detected, and the assignment of a numeric score describing the lesion's severity on an ordinal scale (1-minimal, 2-mild, 3-moderate, 4-marked) for each type that was detected.\n\n【82】 #2,3-Pentanedione\nThe results of a 2-week inhalation study of 2,3-pentanedione toxicity were reported by Morgan et al, Individual animal data  2010. These data describe the pathological responses of male and female Wistar-Han rats and B6C3F1 mice exposed to 2,3-pentanedione by inhalation for 6 hours per day, 5 days per week, for 2 weeks plus 2 days. The exposure concentrations were 0 ppm, 50 ppm, 100 ppm, and 200 ppm, with six animals per dose group; nasal, tracheal, and pulmonary endpoints were assessed.\nIn addition to the 13-week NTP bioassay data described above for diacetyl, the 2,3-pentanedione data were also compared to data for diacetyl from . These data describe the pathological responses of male C57Bl/6 mice exposed to diacetyl by inhalation for 6 hours per day, 5 days per week, for either 6 or 12 weeks. The exposure concentrations were 0 ppm, 25 ppm, 50 ppm, and 100 ppm, with five animals per dose group. Nasal, tracheal, and pulmonary endpoints similar to those examined in the 2,3-pentanedione study were assessed.\n\n【83】 #Analytical approach\nAn empirical approach based on parametric regression modeling of the ordinal response data was adopted to maximize the information available for analysis from the limited numbers of rodents - in order to assess the potency of diacetyl to increase risk and to assess the relative potency of the two chemicals.\n\n【84】 #Benchmark concentration analysis for rats exposed to diacetyl\nThe assessment of the potency of diacetyl to increase risk employed the benchmark dose approach that was originally proposed for risk assessment of non-cancer responses by Crump . development over the past three decades, and it has become an accepted approach for risk assessment .\nCategorical regression has been previously used in the analysis of toxicological data with multiple levels of severity . The severity scores ‡ for each tissue and type of lesion were assumed to be samples from a multinomial distribution following a complementary  cumulative logistic model fitted separately for each species and sex as follows:\nwhere Y ci denotes the corresponding severity score of the i th rodent exposed to concentration, conc c , j Є element of {observed severity scores excluding zero} for the corresponding tissue and type of lesion, Pr( Y ci ≥j)denotes the expected proportion of response score Y ci greater than or equal to j , each α j is an unknown real-valued parameter with α j'  j, and β is an unknown real-valued parameter describing the slope of the effect of concentration on the logit scale. ‡ When no evidence of the lesion being modeled was detected a severity score of zero  was assigned.\nThe term complementary discerns this model from an equivalent cumulative logistic model of Pr(Y ci ≥j) . lower one-sided 95% confidence limit (BMCL) were estimated.\n\n【85】 #Benchmark concentration analysis for mice exposed to diacetyl\n\n【86】 These residuals have mean equal to zero asymptotically if the linear-in-concentration model is correct.\n\n【87】 #Extrapolation of rodent benchmark concentrations to humans\nExtrapolation of rodent BMCs to humans was based on a PBPK/CFD model for diacetyl Morris and Hubbs 2009. The Gloede et al.  extension of the Morris and Hubbs  model predicts tissue concentrations of diacetyl for mucosal surfaces in the nose, trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles of rats and humans exposed to 1 ppm diacetyl. Nose-breathing and mouth-breathing humans are considered, as well as the effects of light exercise as might be expected to occur in the workplace. The Gloede et al.  model assumes mouth breathing during light  exercise conditions. For extrapolation purposes, an 8-hour work day was considered to consist of 2.5 hours of sedentary exposure and 5.5 hours of light exercise, as described by the International Commission on Radiological Protection .\n\n【88】 #Extrapolation of BMCs and BMCLs from the mouse to the rat\nIn the RfC methodology, the deposition and uptake of volatile chemicals are estimated from a combination of chemical characteristics (i.e. reactivity and solubility) and the physiological characteristics of the relevant species (i.e. minute ventilation and the surface area of the relevant portion of the respiratory tract). Diacetyl is classified as a \"category 1\" gas in the RfC methodology because of its high water solubility. Category 1 gases are not expected to reach the pulmonary region in high concentration, but rather to be deposited primarily in the upper respiratory tract and the tracheobronchial region. This is consistent with the behavior of diacetyl in the Gloede et al.  PBPK model, so that the classification of diacetyl as a category 1 gas appears to be appropriate.\nInterspecies dosimetric adjustments via the RfC methodology are based on an estimate of the regional gas dose ratio (RGDR). The RGDR estimates the ratio of gas deposition with a given respiratory tract region in the two species being compared.\nFor the ET region, the RGDR is calculated , eqn. 4-18, as:\nwhere:\nV E = minute volume (mL/min = cm 3 /min) SA = surface area (cm 2 ) ET = a subscript denoting the extrathoracic region A, B = subscripts denoting experimental animal and target species, respectively\n\n【89】 The RGDR is used to adjust a point of departure (POD), i.e. a BMC or BMCL in the laboratory species to an equivalent concentration in the target species as follows:\nPOD BEC = POD A - RGDR where: POD BEC = POD equivalent concentration in the target species; POD A = POD in the experimental species; and RGDR = Species A-to-species B regional gas dose ratio for the appropriate region of the respiratory tract.\nAlthough the RGDR is typically used to develop human equivalent concentrations from experimental animal data, in this case it is used to develop a rat equivalent concentration for a point of departure estimated from experimental data in the mouse. The Gloede et al.  PBPK model is then used to extrapolate from the rat equivalent concentration to a human equivalent concentration.  Mouse-to-rat regional gas dose ratio for the upper respiratory tract  Mouse-to-rat regional gas dose ratio for the tracheobronchial region This conclusion is based on the analysis of Allen , who concluded that the 6-and 12-week mouse experiments had response rates that could be modeled together (i.e. the duration of the experiment could be ignored) for all the lesions analyzed; there did not appear to be a progression toward higher rates of response or more severe responses when the exposure level remained the same but the duration of exposure was increased from 6 to 12 weeks. However, because of the small number of animals used in this study, the power to detect differences between the 6-week and 12-week experiments is limited. As a consequence of the limited duration of the experimental studies and the limited ability to detect differences between the responses at 6 and 12 weeks, the possibility of increased toxicity with lifetime exposure cannot be entirely ruled out. This possibility was addressed through the application of an uncertainty factor (UF) -discussed below -rather than a dosimetric adjustment.\n\n【90】 #Application of uncertainty factors\nThe HECs are estimates of frankly toxic exposure levels, and must be adjusted by the application of UFs to allow for uncertainty in animal-to-human extrapolation, interindividual variability, and less than lifetime exposure. In general, these UFs are assumed to be 10-fold for animal-to-human extrapolation and another 10-fold for interindividual variability. The animal-to-human extrapolation can be subdivided into a factor of 4 for pharmacokinetics and a factor of 2.5 for interspecies variability in susceptibility . In this case, the interspecies pharmacokinetic factor is replaced by the use of the Gloede et al.  pharmacokinetic model, leaving an interspecies UF of 2.5. The UF for interindividual variability can be subdivided into two factors of √10, or 3.2, one for interindividual variability in pharmacokinetics and the other for interindividual variability in susceptibility .\nBecause the toxicity of diacetyl occurs at the point of contact with respiratory tract mucosa there is relatively little opportunity for interindividual variability in pharmacokinetics, and so the first subfactor is not applied. However, interindividual variability in susceptibility to toxicity cannot be ruled out; therefore, a factor of 3.2 is applied. In addition, a factor of 3 is applied for conversion from subchronic to chronic exposure. When the three factors (3.2fold for interindividual variability, 2.5-fold for interspecies variability, and 3-fold for subchronic to chronic) are multiplied, the resulting total UF is\n\n【91】 To avoid the loss of information inherent in dichotomizing ordinal data the severity scores of each type of lesion observed among nasal and lung tissues were modeled as having been sampled from conditional multinomial distributions given the unobserved random effects associated with each mouse described by the following family of complementary cumulative logistic models:\n= α sjr(t) + u bskci + ω s τ bskci +f bskcti β sjr(t) {m(s, k, conc bskci , t, τ bskci ; θ sr(t) , φ skt , γ s )} - conc bskci , where α sjr(t) + u skci + ω s τ bskci describes effects in the absence of exposure, f bskcti β sjr(t) {m(s, k, conc bskci , t, τ bskci ; θ sr(t) , φ skt , γ s )} - conc bskci describes effects of exposure and b indexes the bioassay study s indexes sex, k = 0 ←→ 2,3-pentanedione exposure and k = 1 ←→ diacetyl exposure, bkc identifies the exposure group and conc bkc is the corresponding exposure concentration, i = 1., n bskc indicates each of the mice within the exposure group identified by bskc and conc bskci denotes the corresponding exposure concentration, r(t) identifies the response lesion, r nested within tissue, t, (lung or nasal), Y bskcr(t)i is the response variable that is integer-valued based on the assigned severity score and it ranges over {0,1,2,3} for all response lesions ‡ ‡ except necrosis of the respiratory epithelium of the nose where the range was {0,1,2}, Pr(Y bskcir(t) ≥ j) represents the expected proportion having response severity score greater than or equal to j for j Є {1., max (Y bskcr(t)i )}, α sjt(r) denotes the intercept parameters for lesion r(t) which are subject to constraints α s2t(r) −α s1t(r) =∆α s2 <0 and α s3t(r) −α s2t(r) =∆α s3 <0 thus ensuring α s3t(r) <α s2t(r) <α s1t(r) , u bskci ~N(0, σ 2 su ) is a normally distributed random effect associated with the i th mouse of bskc; likelihood ratio tests of null values of the variance ‡ ‡ When no evidence of the lesion being modeled was detected a severity score of zero  was assigned. Hence, the requirement that r(Y kcit(r) ≥ 3) < Pr(Y kcit(r) ≥ 2) < Pr(Y kcit(r) ≥ 1) is satisfied for the controls. at low doses for {r(t)}; the hypothesis, 0 sr(t) = 0 s , was tested and subject to being incorporated into the model, and φ skt allows for an adjustment for a quadratic effect of concentration that may be attributed to directly proportional changes in respiratory ventilation with concentration where φ skt is the constant of proportionality in units of controls' ventilation; thus φ skt describes the change relative to controls. The hypothesis, φ sk,lung = φ sk,nose = φ sk , was tested and subject to being incorporated into the model. f bskcti is one of a pair of lognormally distributed random effects (one effect per tissue indicated by t) of the i th mouse of exposure group bskc acting multiplicatively on the effect of dose. Thus, an allowance for multiplicative variations from mouse to mouse by tissuespecific positive factors acting on the magnitudes of the slope parameters was incorporated. Each f bskcti was modeled as having unit expectation and variance (e σ 2 st −1); thus, the variance of log (f bskcti ) = σ 2 st , t = 1, 2 for the lung and nose, respectively, together with an associated covariance parameter σ s12 . The hypothesis that lognormal random effects are independent was examined by testing σ s12 = 0 and was subject to being incorporated. Furthermore, the hypothesis that only one lognormal random effect for each mouse was necessary, i.e. f bskc1i = f bskc2i was tested and subject to being incorporated.\nModel development proceeded by sequentially fitting a series of nested models of increasing complexity with all random effects omitted. This was advantageous for obtaining initial estimates of the fixed effects parameters for fitting a corresponding model that included random effects. Models were fitted by the method of maximum likelihood; the likelihoods of models containing unobserved random effects were obtained by integrating out these effects using adaptive Gaussian quadrature as described by Pinheiro and Bates . Likelihood ratio tests were performed to test hypotheses about model parameters and associated P values were based on the chi-square approximation to −2log (LR). Evidence against incorporating the previously described restrictions on model parameters was deemed significant if the P value of the corresponding test was less than 0.05 for selecting the model on which to base the estimation of relative potency parameters and benchmark concentrations.\nThe model selected for estimation of relative potencies and BMCs contained three lognormal random effects parameters and 53 fixed-effects parameters; it had the following form: st  = 0 for lognormal random effects of nasal responses of female mice was replaced by nullifying this parameter, The adequacy of a single lognormal random effect was rejected, Independence of the lognormal random effects for lung and nasal tissues of male mice  was assumed.\nThe fit of the model was assessed by calculating grouped ‡ ‡ ‡ Pearson residuals conditional on the NLMixed minimizes -log(L) and it provides a warning if its criteria for a positive definite Hessian is not satisfied; no such warning was given. ‡ ‡ ‡\nThe term \"grouped\" is to clarify that they are based on summing the observed and fitted expectations and variances over the mice within each treatment group defined by each unique combination of b x k x s x c.\nempirical Bayes estimates of the random effects for each tissue-response as follows:\nwhere the fitted expectations and variances of each mouse were based on the associated binomial distribution of a factoring of the conditional multinomial likelihood into its conditionally independent binomial components corresponding to the \"outcomes\" (Y≥1 | f ) , (Y≥2|Y≥1,f ), and (Y≥3|Y≥2,f ).\nFurthermore, a saturated fixed-effects model with random effects omitted was compared to the selected model by examination of twice the difference of log(Likelihood) values relative to the difference in the number of parameters. Finally, an ad hoc procedure was applied wherein binomial deviance residuals corresponding to factoring the multinomial likelihood of the corresponding 53 parameter model (with random effects omitted) into a product of conditional binomial terms were used to estimate a factor for adjusting the width of the confidence intervals analogous to an adjustment for overdispersion because the model-based confidence intervals may be too narrow if the model is incorrect. Twosided 95% confidence limits with and without adjustment were calculated from application of a normal approximation to the natural logarithms of the relative potencies and the BMCs associated with a 10% benchmark response for additional risk. i.e. Pr(Y skcr(t) ≥ j | conc=BMC jskr(t) , f skcti = 1)−Pr(Y skcr(t) ≥ j | conc = 0, f skcti = 1) =\n\n【92】 #Benchmark concentration analysis using quantal models\n\n【93】 #Diacetyl\n\n【94】 Overall, the BMCs range from 16.8-68 ppm diacetyl, and the BMCLs range from 10-49.9 ppm diacetyl. After interspecies pharmacokinetic adjustments based on the Gloede et al.  model, the human-equivalent BMCL values (BMCL_HECs) range from 1.4-95.8 ppm diacetyl, and the BMCL candidate REL values (after the application of uncertainty factors) range from 0.06-4.0 ppm diacetyl.\n\n【95】 #Sensitivity analysis\n\n【96】 A key assumption made in this risk assessment is that the Gloede et al.  PBPK model is the most appropriate method for extrapolating from rats to humans. A possible alternative would be to use the EPA  RfC methodology to estimate animal-to-human scaling factors, based on the RGDR.\nCorresponding values for mouse-to-human extrapolation are 0.43, 5.9, and 6.9 for the upper respiratory tract, the tracheobronchial region, and the pulmonary tract, respectively. These RGDRs would replace the Gloede et al. PBPK model for extrapolating from rats to humans, and would result in candidate RELs ranging from 0.15-16.1 ppm for BMCs, and from 0.10-14.3 ppm for BMCLs. The lowest candidate REL derived using the RGDR method would be 0.10 ppm, as opposed to 0.06 ppm using the Gloede et al.  model.\nThe animal-to-human PK factor shown here is the RGDR for the rat nose, which in EPA methodology is applied to the BMC/BMCL as a multiplicative factor. This is unlike the PBPK-derived PK factors above, which are applied as divisors for the BMC/BMCL values.\n\n【97】 #2,3-Pentanedione\nThe ventilation coefficient  of 2,3-pentanedione among male mice was −0.312 ± 0.0139 and among females it was −0.182 ± 0.05\n6.4 Discussion 6.4.1 Diacetyl\n\n【98】 #Modeling issues in BMC estimation for diacetyl\n\n【99】 In the current analysis, BMC estimates for diacetyl, based on categorical regression modeling, range from 16.8-68 ppm diacetyl, and the BMCL estimates range from 10-49.9 ppm diacetyl . For comparison, alternative BMC estimates based on a quantal modeling range from 14.6-78 ppm, and quantal model BMCL estimates range from 2.4-57.9 ppm. Although the central BMC estimates were similar for the quantal and categorical modeling approaches, some of the quantal model BMCL estimates are several-fold lower than any obtained using categorical modeling Additional sensitivity analyses explored the sensitivity of the toxicologically-based risk assessment for diacetyl to basing the mouse-to-rat extrapolation on allometrically-scaled respiration rates rather than measured values, and to basing the animal-to-human extrapolation on RfC methodology  rather than the Gloede et al.  PBPK model.\n\n【100】 #Comparison with other toxicologically-based risk assessments\nThe numerical values of BMD estimates for diacetyl are not all directly comparable, even when based on a common response rate of 10%, because of variations in the dose units used (ppm concentration versus regional penetration versus tissue concentration). The occupational exposure limits (OELs) developed by the various authors are directly comparable, but depend in part on assumptions regarding uncertainty factors, which may vary between studies. In contrast, the HEC estimates derived in this analysis can be directly compared to the HEC estimates that have been developed in prior risk assessments.\nEarlier toxicologically-based risk assessments of diacetyl  have been based on the 6-week and 12-week mouse study of , rather than the more extensive subchronic study conducted by the NTP . Because the NTP  subchronic study included data from both mice and rats and included both more dose levels and more animals per dose group than the  study, the NTP  diacetyl study was chosen as the basis for risk assessment in this document. However, comparison of the current risk assessment findings to the results of the earlier risk assessments is instructive.\nMaier et al.  conducted a risk assessment for diacetyl for the purpose of deriving an OEL. This risk assessment was based on the mouse pilot study data of , using BMD methodology. The authors concluded that the most sensitive endpoint in the mouse prepared under OSHA contract number DOLQ059622303  Task Order 50. These reports served as the basis for the toxicologically-based diacetyl risk assessment in the draft NIOSH criteria document for diacetyl in 2011 but have been supplanted in the current document by an analysis of more recent data. A summary of the risk assessment extracted from these reports is included here, for comparison to the current toxicologically-based quantitative risk assessment.\nA variety of dosimetric adjustments were considered in extrapolating the results from mice to humans. The most significant of these adjustments was the choice of dose metrics, either \"regional penetration\" (based on the percentage of diacetyl reaching a given portion of the respiratory tract), or \"tissue concentration\" (based on the Morris and Hubbs  PBPK model).\n\n【101】 TERA's analysis resulted in estimates of HECs that were 9 and 2 ppm, corresponding to the estimated BMD and BMDL, respectively, from their dose-response analysis of the peribronchial inflammation endpoint from . The TERA assessment suggested that a composite uncertainty factor of 10 should be used to adjust those HECs downward to an OEL. That factor of 10 was the product of a factor of 3 for interspecies differences and another factor of 3 for human variability . These factors of 3 are well-accepted uncertainty factors commonly used by EPA and others in risk assessment. Their recommended OEL was therefore 0.2 ppm (as an 8-hour TWA).\n\n【102】 #2,3-Pentanedione\nToxic potency estimation for 2,3-pentanedione is constrained by both the limited numbers of animals that have been tested and the differing exposure durations used in the diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione studies. The currently available histopathological data for repeated exposures to 2,3-pentanedione are limited to a single study involving exposures of 2 weeks + 2 days (totaling 12 exposures per animal), in both rats and mice. The rat data and female mouse data for diacetyl are limited to a single 13-week study , so that no data on the relationship of toxicity to duration of exposure are available for the rat or the female mouse.\nAlthough no mouse studies are available that closely approximate the 2 week + 2 day exposure protocol used in the 2,3-pentanedione study, the 6-, 12-, and 13-week diacetyl data on male mice were used to estimate an adjustment to predict what the toxicity of diacetyl would have been in a study of the same duration as the 2,3-pentanedione study. Although a small increase of toxicity with exposure duration was fitted it was retained in the model even though it was not significant in order to account for it as a source of variation in obtaining the standard errors of the seven relative potency estimates of each sex. The resulting relative potency estimates suggest that 2,3-pentanedione may have equal or greater toxic potency than diacetyl for five of the seven responses of male mice from For those readers acquainted with the concept of Stein estimation for adjusting a set of three or more estimates an application of a criterion of Bock  to the covariance matrix of each set did not support making them.  6-10 superficially suggest that 2,3-pentanedione is or seems to be less toxic than diacetyl to female mice, these estimates are sensitively dependent on the assumption that the parameter for exposure duration is identical to that of males. Furthermore, there is a complete lack of information from these studies for assessing this assumption and profiling the likelihood indicated that the relative potency estimates of the female mice were substantially sensitive to this parameter whereas this did not hold for the estimates of the males.\nHowever, these data do suggest that it would be prudent to treat 2,3-pentanedione as at least equally toxic as diacetyl until additional toxicological data become available on the toxic potency of 2,3-pentanedione.\n\n【103】 #Conclusions\nPathological lesions produced by inhalation exposure to diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione have been assessed using categorical regression techniques and benchmark dose estimation. For diacetyl a CFD/PBPK model is available for both rats and humans that allows rodent BMC and BMCL estimates to be extrapolated directly to human exposures. The results of this exercise indicate that the most sensitive endpoint in terms of estimated human toxicity is that associated with eosinophilic inflammation in the male rat lung. The HEC associated with this endpoint is 1.8 ppm, with a 95% lower-bound estimate of 1.4 ppm . Application of a 24-fold uncertainty factor to the lower-bound HEC leads to a candidate REL of 0.06 ppm, or 60 ppb diacetyl. The estimated human toxicity based on chronic bronchial inflammation in the female mouse lung is very similar to the ratbased estimate , and also leads to a candidate REL of 0.06 ppm or 60 ppb. If human data on the toxicity of diacetyl were not available, these estimates could serve as the bases for REL development for diacetyl. Because human data do exist and are sufficient for derivation of an REL, the toxicologically-based candidate RELs should be viewed as complementary to the epidemiologically-based REL. Because the toxicologically-based REL is within an order of magnitude of the epidemiologically-based REL it supports the epidemiologically-based REL.\n\n【104】 7 Basis of the Recommended Standards for Diacetyl and 2,3-Pentanedione\nIn the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (Public Law 91-96), Congress mandated that NIOSH develop and recommend criteria for identifying and controlling workplace hazards that may result in occupational illness or injury. In fulfilling this mandate, NIOSH has reviewed the relevant human and/or animal data to assess the health effects of diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione; assessed the risks of occupational exposure; characterized anticipated employee exposures; and developed recommended criteria for exposure limits, exposure monitoring, engineering and work practice controls, and medical monitoring.\nThe primary objective of the recommendations for diacetyl is to reduce loss of lung function associated with diacetyl exposure because diacetyl (and potentially related diones) has been shown to cause potentially fatal obliterative bronchiolitis in employees. The NIOSH REL for 2,3-pentanedione would be identical to that for diacetyl but is slightly higher based upon the limitations of the analytical method.\n\n【105】 #Health Effect Studies of Employees Exposed to Diacetyl\nObliterative bronchiolitis, sometimes characterized by spirometric abnormality, has been described in employees in the microwave popcorn and flavor-manufacturing industries . Some affected employees have experienced extremely rapid declines in lung function, with severe airways obstruction in some cases occurring within several months of the start of exposure to flavoring compounds NIOSH 1986. Employees as young as 22 years old have been affected. Some affected employees have been placed on lung transplant waiting lists by their physicians because of the severity of their disease . These findings meet the standard criteria used to determine causation: that an exposure is the likely cause of specific health effects . Investigations of severe lung disease consistent with obliterative bronchiolitis among diacetyl-exposed employees have provided clear evidence of a causal relationship between diacetyl exposure and development of this disease.\n\n【106】 #Toxicological Studies of Diacetyl\nIn rats, acute exposures to diacetyl or diacetylcontaining butter flavoring vapors cause necrosis in the epithelial lining of nasal and pulmonary airways. Rats inhaling vapors of butter flavoring that contained diacetyl developed multifocal necrotizing bronchitis one day after a 6-hour exposure. The mainstem bronchus was the most affected intrapulmonary airway. However, nasal airways were more affected than intrapulmonary airways. Necrosuppurative rhinitis was seen in rats inhaling butter flavoring vapors at concentrations that did not cause damage in intrapulmonary airways . As a single agent acute exposure in rats, diacetyl caused epithelial necrosis and inflammation in bronchi at concentrations of >290 ppm and caused epithelial necrosis and inflammation in the trachea and larynx at concentrations of ≥220 ppm . In a pattern similar to that of airway damage from diacetyl-containing butter flavoring vapors, diacetyl causes greater damage to nasal airways than to intrapulmonary airways in rats .\nIn mice, inhaling diacetyl at concentrations of 200 or 400 ppm for 6 hours/day for up to 5 days caused respiratory tract changes similar to those seen in rats inhaling diacetyl or diacetylcontaining butter flavoring vapors . Subchronic diacetyl inhalation caused significant histopathological changes in mice at all concentrations studied. Peribronchial lymphocytic infiltrates were seen at terminal sacrifice at 12 weeks in all subchronically exposed mice inhaling 100 ppm diacetyl and in some mice inhaling 25 or 50 ppm diacetyl.\nUsing a CFD-PBPK model, the rodent pathologic changes, though at higher regions in the respiratory tract, were consistent with the human bronchiolar pathology once differential nasal scrubbing, size of airway, and target organ doses were accounted for Morris and Hubbs 2009. In rats in which nasal scrubbing was bypassed by administering a single dose of 125 mg/kg diacetyl via intratracheal instillation, histopathological alterations\n\n【107】 #Objectives\nThe NIOSH objective in establishing RELs for diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione is to reduce the risk of respiratory impairment (decreased lung function) and the severe irreversible lung disease obliterative bronchiolitis associated with occupational exposure to these compounds. In addition, maintaining exposures below the RELs will help prevent other adverse health effects including but not limited to irritation of the skin, eyes, and respiratory tract in exposed employees. The recommendation to limit exposure to diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione is based upon data from human and animal studies and the quantitative risk assessment, however, additional considerations included sampling and analytical feasibility and the achievability of engineering controls.\n\n【108】 In the absence of a STEL in workplaces complying with the NIOSH REL for diacetyl of 5 ppb TWA, employees could theoretically be exposed to 2,400 ppb diacetyl for 1 minute or 480 ppb for 5 minutes in an 8-hour day with no additional exposure the remaining part of their 8-hour shift. The STEL for diacetyl of 25 ppb would limit those exposures to a possible peak of 375 ppb for 1 minute and 75 ppb for 5 minutes and should prevent acute irritation from brief high exposures.\n7.5.2 Recommended Exposure Limit for 2,3-Pentanedione 2,3-Pentanedione, which has been used as a substitute for diacetyl, is also of concern because of structural similarities with diacetyl and because animal studies show similar toxicity for the respiratory tract . Morphologic data suggest that 2,3-pentanedione can cause airway epithelial damage similar to the damage caused by diacetyl . Rats repeatedly inhaling 2,3-pentanedione at concentrations ≥ 150 ppm for up to 2 weeks develop fibrosis of intrapulmonary airways, a morphologic change similar to obliterative bronchiolitis in humans . Recently, more than 3500 genes were found to be upregulated in RNA isolated from the fibrotic bronchi of 2,3-pentanedione exposed rats . Some of the up-regulated genes were ones previously implicated in fibrosis, including transforming growth factor-β2, interleukin-1α, interleukin-18, interleukin-33, and fibronectin. In addition, at high exposure concentrations, messenger RNA changes were noted in the brain of rats after acute 2,3-pentanedione inhalation .\nBecause of their structural similarity, concerns for short-term exposures to 2,3-pentanedione also apply. Accordingly, a STEL for 2,3-pentanedione is established at 31 ppb (i.e. the lowest concentrations the method can sample accurately during a 15-minute time period). The NIOSH REL for 2,3-pentanedione of 9.3 ppb and STEL of 31 ppb would limit exposures to a possible peak of 465 ppb for 1 minute and 93 ppb for 5 minutes. Because of the concern for potential dose-rate effects, NIOSH recommends STELs for diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione to reduce peak exposures to employees.\nMaintaining diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione concentrations at or below the RELs and STELs requires the implementation of a comprehensive safety and health program that includes engineering controls, exposure monitoring, routine medical surveillance, and employee training in good work practices.\n\n【109】 #Rationale for the Recommended Exposure Limit\nThe recommendation to limit occupational exposures to diacetyl to an 8-hour TWA of 5 ppb is based on data from human quantitative risk assessment with additional rationale provided by animal toxicological studies.\nFrom the human studies, 5 ppb represents a reasonable summary of estimates from several concordant approaches to risk assessment. Although smoking affects the excess lifetime risk estimates, a full treatment for the purpose of developing separate REL recommendations on smoking status would require including interactions between smoking and diacetyl exposure histories for which NIOSH believes there is insufficient historical information and statistical power to implement. Furthermore, there is no precedent for developing standards that are specific to smoking status. NIOSH also recommends an AL of 2.6 ppb to help protect employees from exposure to diacetyl above the 5 ppb REL and a STEL of 25 ppb to limit peak exposures and protect against dose-rate effects. Engineering controls and work practices are available to control diacetyl exposures below the REL (and the AL) in workplaces. OSHA Method 1012 is a validated analytical method that can be used to effectively measure employee exposures to diacetyl. Establishing the recommended exposure limits for diacetyl is consistent with the mission of NIOSH mandated in the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 19\n\n【110】 #Controlling Diacetyl and 2,3-Pentanedione Exposures in the Workplace\nIn general, many industries have implemented engineering controls to reduce exposure and risk of disease among their employees. Many of the processes where diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione are manufactured, handled, or used are similar to other industries and may allow for common approaches to reducing employee exposure. These processes include blending, mixing, and handling of flavoring compounds in liquid and powder form. A 3-year study of a microwave popcorn production facility showed that the use of exposure controls can dramatically reduce diacetyl concentrations in mixing rooms and for all production employees . As a result of the implementation of exposure controls, average combined personal and area diacetyl air concentrations declined an order of magnitude in the mixing room (from 57.2 ppm to 2.88 ppm) while concentrations in the quality control laboratory (from 0.82 ppm to < LOD) and packaging area (from 2.76 ppm to < LOD for machine operators) declined to below detectable limits. These interventions included providing general room exhaust ventilation to the mixing room and local exhaust ventilation for the heated flavoring and mixing tanks. Closed transfer processes were implemented through the installation of a pump to transfer heated butter flavorings from the holding tanks to oil/flavor mixing tanks. The building of an enclosure for all oil/flavor holding tanks and installing local exhaust ventilation on all tanks further reduced exposures to employees in the packaging area of this plant. In the final survey conducted following the implementation of all engineering and process controls, personal diacetyl exposures for all employees/job categories in the plant were below detectable limits with the exception of mixers which ranged from below the LOD to 12.6 ppm.\nThe design concepts required for working with hazardous materials include specification of general ventilation, local exhaust ventilation, maintenance, cleaning and disposal, personal protective equipment, exposure monitoring, and medical surveillance . Bag emptying, bag filling, charging tanks, benchtop weighing and handling, and drum filling and emptying are a few of the production processes of concern. Other more specialized processes (for example, candy panning, a process in which candy pieces in a rotating drum are sprayed with chocolate or other flavoring compounds; coffee roasting; commercial fry-cooking) may also result in employee exposure. Special attention should be given to manual handling of flavoring compounds, particularly in heated processes, and when spraying flavoring compounds.\nResearch on food industry practices has led to the development of engineering controls that may help reduce employee exposure to diacetyl, 2,3-pentanedione, and other chemicals.\nAlthough many job categories can be effectively controlled to levels below the REL, tasks associated with transfer of diacetyl may continue to pose risk to the employees even following the implementation of controls. For example, mixers may continue to be exposed at levels above the REL when handling butter flavorings and from tank emissions. NIOSH acknowledges that the frequent use of personal protective equipment, including respirators, may be required for some employees who handle diacetyl, 2,3-pentanedione, diacetyl-containing flavorings or flavored products. The frequent use of PPE may be required during job tasks for which  airborne concentrations of diacetyl or 2,3-pentanedione (e.g. pouring, mixing, packaging) above the REL exist,  the airborne concentration of diacetyl or 2,3-pentanedione is unknown or unpredictable, and  job tasks are associated with highly variable airborne concentrations because of environmental conditions or the manner in which the job is performed. In all work environments where diacetyl, 2,3-pentanedione, diacetyl-containing flavorings or flavored products are found, control of exposure through engineering controls should be the highest priority.\n\n【111】 #Hazards Associated with Diacetyl Substitutes\nMuch has been made of the possible removal/ substitution of diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione from the flavor manufacturing or food production industries. A health benefit from substitution can only be realized if the substitute is safer than diacetyl or 2,3-pentanedione. However, the current knowledge on toxicity of available substitutes is limited; few if any have OELs, and therefore exposure to substitutes should be controlled.\nThere is reason to think that, like diacetyl, other alpha-dicarbonyl compounds would have a tendency to cause protein cross-links . The reactivity of the alpha-dicarbonyl compounds is enhanced by electron-attracting groups and decreased by electron donors . Alpha-dicarbonyl compounds can inactivate proteins, principally through reactions with the amino acid, arginine . The related alphadicarbonyl flavoring, 2,3-pentanedione, has been reported to be even more reactive with arginine groups than diacetyl .\nWhile the focus of this document is on diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione, NIOSH has concern about other flavoring substitutes with structures similar to diacetyl or moieties that are biologically active and capable of producing similar toxic effects as diacetyl. Therefore, NIOSH recommends that such exposures also be considered and controlled to concentrations as low as possible, taking into account potential additive effects of flavoring compounds.\nThe field studies showed reductions in exposure of 90%-97% when performing mixing tasks using these stations . Also, the use of controls to reduce employee exposure during pouring and mixing of ingredients in a commercial mixer has been evaluated in a flavoring production plant . The use of LEV at the mixing tank helps to maintain the vessel at a negative pressure and contain evaporative emissions. NIOSH evaluated the impact of a ventilated tank lid on the exposure of an employee during the mixing of a food flavoring .\n\n【112】 #Summary\nThe following points summarize the relevant information used as the basis for the NIOSH recommendation for limiting occupational exposure to diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione: The idea behind this hierarchy is that the control methods at the top of the list are potentially more effective, protective, and economical (in the long run) than those at the bottom. Following the hierarchy normally leads to the implementation of inherently safer systems where the risk of illness or injury has been substantially reduced.\nThe first item in the hierarchy is elimination/ substitution. The intention of eliminating a flavoring or other chemical in the workplace is to remove the exposure by removing the source. Similarly, the goal of substitution is to substitute a flavoring or chemical with another of lower toxicity. The removal of diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione from the flavor manufacturing or flavoring industries would be practical only with the substitution of an alternative butter flavor chemical, which is currently being done in some situations. However, the current knowledge on toxicity of available substitutes is limited, and exposure to substitutes may also need to be controlled The recommendations that follow are applicable not only to diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione, but also to other flavorings and flavoring compounds used in this industry.\nEngineering controls, as discussed below, are mechanical techniques for removing contaminants from the workplace. For instance, local exhaust ventilation can be used to capture and remove emissions from a hazardous or nuisance source. A major advantage of this type of system is that, when properly designed, it requires minimal user effort or training. The use of respirators, a form of PPE, is discussed because this control, while not favored, is in common use in some facilities. As the discussion demonstrates, considerable effort is required in the proper selection and use of respiratory protection in the workplace. Finally, the protection of skin, eyes, and face is also discussed.\n\n【113】 #Engineering Controls\nCurrently, there is no model or standard guidance for engineering controls for flavoring and food production processes. If it is not possible to eliminate toxic compounds from the workplace or replace them with less toxic substances, then the use of engineering controls and work practices to minimize exposures is the next level of controls for the necessary reduction of exposure.\n\n【114】 #General Considerations\nA properly designed supply air ventilation system can provide plant ventilation, building pressurization, and exhaust air replacement.\nWhen LEV is installed in production areas, it is important to consider the need for replacement air. In general, it is necessary to balance the amount of exhausted air with a nearly equal amount of supply air. Without replacement air, uncontrolled drafts will exist at doors, windows, and other openings; doors become difficult to open because of the high pressure difference; and exhaust fan performance may degrade. Good supply air design consists of ducted supply with air discharge registers about 10 feet above floor level .\nControls need to be fitted to individual processes by each plant and cannot be a \"onesize-fits-all\" approach. Controls need to be evaluated after installation. Evaluations should be completed to quantify exposures after controls have been implemented to ensure that target goals have been achieved. It is important to confirm that the LEV system is operating as designed by periodically measuring exhaust airflows. A standard measurement, hood static pressure, provides important information on the hood performance, because any change in airflow results in a change in hood static pressure. For hoods designed to prevent exposures to hazardous airborne contaminants, the ACGIH Operation and Maintenance Manual recommends the installation of a fixed hood static pressure gauge .\nIn addition to routine monitoring of the hood static pressure, additional system checks should be completed periodically to ensure adequate system performance, including smoke tube testing, hood slot/face velocity measurements, and duct velocity measurements using an anemometer. These system evaluation tasks should become part of a routine preventive maintenance schedule to check system performance.\nIt is important to note that the collection and release of air contaminants may be regulated; companies should contact agencies responsible for local air pollution control to ensure compliance with emissions requirements when implementing new or revised engineering controls.\nTo minimize exposure and reduce the risk of flavoring-related lung disease, a few standard precautions should be followed in areas where flavoring-related exposures may occur:\nIsolate rooms where flavorings or flavoring compounds are handled from the rest of the plant with walls, doors, or other barriers.  Maintain flavoring mixing rooms and other areas where flavorings are handled under negative air pressure relative to the rest of the plant. Check status with airflow indication equipment such as a smoke tube.\nInstall hood static pressure gauges (manometers) near hoods to provide a way to verify proper hood performance. Check pressure frequently to ensure that the system is operating properly compared to baseline. Check hood face velocities and capture velocities frequently to ensure that system is performing as designed.  Ensure that employees are properly trained on the use of the controls if using proximity switches for fan activation. Consider installing a control \"on/ off \" light to indicate the status of the exhaust fan.  Place hoods away from doors, windows, air supply registers, and aisles when possible to reduce the impact of cross drafts.  Provide supply air to production rooms to replace most of the exhausted air.  Direct exhaust air discharge stacks away from air intakes, doors, and windows.  Inspect hoods and enclosures for signs of damage or leaks (rust/corrosion, open access doors, etc.) and obstructions (paper, gloves, rags, etc.). Where possible, use screens to prevent foreign objects from being pulled into the system through openings (slots, hood faces, etc.).\n\n【115】 #Primary Production Processes and Controls\nThe food and flavoring production industries have several primary processes that may result in increased potential for employee exposure to diacetyl, 2,3-pentanedione and other flavoring compounds. These may be grouped, from an exposure standpoint, into a few general categories including production operations, packaging operations, cleaning, and maintenance operations . Employees in each of these job categories may potentially be exposed to flavoring compounds, including diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione.\nMany different industries have implemented engineering controls to reduce exposure and risk of disease among their employees. Many of the processes used in the flavoring and food manufacturing industries are similar to those of other industries and may allow for common approaches to reducing employee exposure. These processes include blending, mixing, and handling of flavoring compounds in liquid and powder form. The design concepts required for working with hazardous materials include specification of general ventilation, LEV, maintenance, cleaning and disposal, PPE, exposure monitoring, and medical surveillance . Bag emptying, bag filling, charging tanks, benchtop weighing and handling, and drum filling and emptying are a few of the production processes of concern. Other more specialized processes (for example, candy panning, a process in which candy pieces in a rotating drum are sprayed with chocolate or other flavoring compounds) may also result in employee exposure. Special attention should be given to manual handling of flavoring compounds, particularly in heated processes, and when spraying flavoring compounds.\nResearch into various food industries has led to the development of potential engineering controls to help reduce employee exposure to diacetyl, 2,3-pentanedione and other chemicals.\n\n【116】 #Benchtop weighing and handling\nSmall-scale weighing and handling of ingredients are common tasks used in flavoring production, bakeries, dairy production, and snack food manufacturing. The tasks of weighing out dry and wet food ingredients can lead to employee exposure primarily through the scooping, pouring, and dumping of these materials. Studies in bakeries have shown that the employees exposed to dusts, commonly from flour, are those who perform mixing and weighing tasks . In addition, a recent survey at a commercial bakery showed that mixer operators were exposed to diacetyl when they measured and added an artificial butter flavor to a dough mixer . Because weighing and pouring are often performed on a benchtop workstation, the addition of slotted backdraft ventilation for both the bench and the weighing area is recommended. This approach can also be applied to larger-scale operations.\nThe application of engineering controls to reduce employee exposure to chemicals during mixing and weighing has been evaluated in flavoring production. In flavoring production facilities, compounders measure and pour flavoring compounds on a bench and then transfer these mixtures to open tanks for liquid flavoring production or to blenders used for powdered flavoring production. The use of ventilated backdraft workstations, adapted from welding bench designs available in the ACGIH Industrial Ventilation Design Manual  has been evaluated by NIOSH in two field studies conducted in flavoring production plants .\nVentilated back-draft workstations used for small batch mixing have been evaluated in two field studies conducted in flavoring production plants . These stations were designed to maintain an air velocity of 100-150 feet per minute (fpm) at the face of the enclosure. The field studies showed reductions in exposure of 90%-97% when performing mixing tasks using these stations . The key design parameters are to enclose as much of the activity as possible and to use properly sized exhaust slots to maintain a uniform air velocity across the face of the station.\nOther groups have also produced designs that may be amenable to the control of exposure during benchtop mixing and weighing activities. The HSE has developed a series of control approaches based on common processes in a variety of industries. One approach is similar to the one evaluated by NIOSH in flavoring facilities and recommends a control velocity of 100-200 fpm (0.5-1 meters per second ) at the face of the workstation when working with flour improvers  .\n\n【117】 #Laboratory chemical hoods\nLaboratory personnel will typically perform benchtop weighing and handling of flavorings in a chemical fume hood. A properly designed and maintained chemical fume hood can offer significant employee protection if used properly. There are many different hood designs, but the most common categories are the conventional or constant-flow hood, the bypass hood, and the variable air volume constant-velocity hood. The constant-flow hood is the oldest and simplest chemical hood design. The exhaust fan induces a constant volumetric airflow moving through the sash opening. For this hood design, the face velocity is lowest when the sash is wide open; when the sash is lowered the face velocity increases. The bypass hood maintains a constant hood face velocity and incorporates a bypass grille above the sash opening. When the sash is wide open it blocks the bypass grille, allowing all of the air to flow through the hood opening. As the sash is lowered, it uncovers increasingly greater amounts of the bypass grille, allowing increasing amounts of air to flow through this alternative path. If it is designed and operated properly, the amount of air flowing through the bypass grille is just sufficient to maintain a constant face velocity. Typically, however, this constant velocity can be maintained over a certain part of the sash's total range. The constant-velocity hood uses a control system to detect the sash position, face velocity and system pressure, and change the fan motor speed or other mechanism, such as mechanical dampers, to increase the airflow when the sash is raised and decrease it when the sash is lowered, thus maintaining a constant face velocity.\n\n【118】 #Charging/filling tanks and mixers\nThe addition of solid and liquid ingredients into tanks and other mixing vessels can cause exposure to dusts and vapors due to the displacement of air in the vessel. Medical and environmental surveys conducted in the microwave popcorn manufacturing industry have shown that employees who mixed butter flavorings into heated soybean oil had the highest exposures to diacetyl and the highest risk of developing severe irreversible lung disease . These employees measured out artificial butter flavoring in open containers and poured the flavoring into heated mixing tanks filled with oil. Real-time monitoring of a mixer at one plant measured a diacetyl peak of more than 80 ppm over several minutes as he poured flavorings into the mixing tank . NIOSH investigations at a plant where many exposed employees developed severe lung disease also showed that the implementation of LEV for heated tanks of oil and flavorings and general dilution ventilation for production areas reduced diacetyl concentrations. As a result of the implementation of exposure controls, average personal diacetyl air concentrations declined in the mixing room, from 57.2 ppm to 2.88 ppm . Exposures to diacetyl were also recorded at a plant that produced flavorings and other products in employees who added flavors to mixing and spray dryer feed tanks while the tanks were being filled. One employee who was adding diacetyl-containing starter distillate and starch to a spray dryer slurry feed tank was exposed to elevated levels of volatile organic compounds including diacetyl for a sustained period of time . In addition, elevated concentrations of volatile contaminants were measured as an employee poured diacetylcontaining starter distillate from a collection vessel into a bulk container.\nAnother approach evaluated by NIOSH at a flavoring manufacturing facility was the use of a ventilated mixing booth. This booth allows a large portable mixing tank to be rolled inside so that chemical vapors emitted during pouring and mixing of flavoring compounds in the tank are captured and exhausted .\nHowever, the booth provides some flexibility and can also be used for other production tasks such as large pouring and product packaging activities. The use of slots across the booth plenum helps evenly distribute the flow across the height and width of the booth. A field study showed hood capture efficiencies of greater than 95% based on tracer gas tests . An important design consideration is to make the booth deep enough to fully contain the process.\nOther approaches to controlling exposure during filling of mixing vessels and tanks include the use of a simple exhaust hood near the opening of fixed tanks. This approach is highlighted in the HSE Control Approach 210, titled \"Charging Reactors and Mixers from a Sack or Keg\"  . This design calls for the use of a local exhaust hood near the tank opening with an inward velocity of at least 200 fpm. Another design provided by the HSE and ACGIH for mixers and tanks includes the use of rim exhausts placed around the edge of the mixer/tank.\n\n【119】 #Bag dumping/emptying\nManual handling of solid powders is a process used in many industries, including food and flavoring production. The opening and dumping of bags of powdered ingredients is commonly performed by employees in the production of flavorings, dairy products, snack foods, and in baked goods. Typically, an employee cuts open bags of material (e.g. 50-pound bags) and dumps the ingredients into a hopper, and then stacks or disposes of the empty bags. In powdered flavoring production, these hoppers are commonly outfitted onto blenders used to load the base starch ingredient for dry flavor blends. In snack food production, they may be used to load spices and flavors for application to the product via open drum coaters just before packaging. These open-ended devices typically are used to coat larger, more irregularly shaped materials such as cereal flakes or expanded snacks. Coatings may be applied as a slurry or as a dry mix following spray application of oil or lecithin. The drums rotate as the flavoring is being applied to allow for even coverage of the snacks. This process can cause employee exposure to the powdered flavoring; a case of bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia was reported in a spice process technician whose primary responsibility was to manually dump spices from bags into a slurry for application to potato chips .\nTechnology used to control dusts during bag dumping has been in place for many years.\nThe standard control-a ventilated bag dump station-consists of a hopper outfitted with an exhaust ventilation system to pull dusts away from employees as they open and dump bags of powdery materials. The designs for these devices are available from several sources of industrial ventilation guidance. The HSE has developed a control approach for a ventilated station for emptying bags of solid materials. The control includes the specification of a face velocity of 200 fpm (1.0 m/s) and includes a waste bag collection chute  .\nResearch into the effectiveness of these types of devices has shown that they can effectively reduce employee exposure to dust and vapors.\nA review of commercially available units showed that their use controlled dust levels to 1-2 mg/m 3 . However, dust contamination on the surface of the bag and handling or disposal of bags caused increased employee exposure. An integral pass through to a bag disposal chute or compactor will help reduce dust exposure resulting from bag handling. Further studies in mineral processing plants showed that the use of an overhead air supply also significantly decreased employee exposure .\nThe ACGIH Ventilation Manual also has two designs that are applicable to the control of powder materials during bag dumping. Design plate VS-15-20, Toxic Material Bag Opening, is similar in design to the HSE station described above but recommends a slightly higher control velocity of 250 fpm at the face of the station opening.\n\n【120】 #Bag filling\nThe process by which bags are filled with products is typically done by flavor manufacturers and other producers of powder materials.\nPowder flavorings are typically mixed with industrial blenders or produced by a spray drying process. For the blending process, a powdered starch or other carbohydrate is combined with a liquid or paste flavoring agent. When the blending is completed, the powder product may be discharged into a bulk tote or packaged into smaller containers. In the spray drying process, a mixture of liquid and powder ingredients (slurry) is sprayed within a large sealed tank. Heat within the tank dries the slurry droplets, leaving a powder as the Occupational Exposure to Diacetyl and 2,3-Pentanedione 1\nfinished product. This powder is then collected and packaged in product containers.\n\n【121】 In addition to ventilation solutions, other dust control approaches have been used in a variety of industries and should be applicable for food and flavoring production. For example, an inflatable seal can be used to create a dust tight seal on the discharge outlet of an industrial blender . The outlet spout can be fitted with an inflatable seal that prevents dust from escaping during the bag filling process. The seal inflates during the product transfer from the blender to the packaging bag (providing the seal) and deflates once the transfer is completed to allow removal of the packaging bag. These systems are available on many commercially available bulk bag filling systems .\nAnother system that can be used is the continuous liner system. Polypropylene liners are often used when products are discharged from the industrial blenders into the final product container. In this operation, a sleeve of polypropylene liners is stowed around the circumference of the discharge outlet. The first liner, the bottom having been sealed, is pulled down into the overpack (usually a 5-gallon bucket or a cardboard box). Product is discharged into the liner through a butterfly valve on the blender outlet. Once full, the top of the first liner sleeve is closed with tape or a fastener, or it is heat sealed and cut. The product is sealed within the poly-lined container, and a new sealed poly-liner is pulled down to start discharge into the next container. This continuous process seals off the primary leak paths for dust during unloading of an industrial blender or other equipment. These systems are commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry and may provide effective alternatives to traditional local exhaust ventilation control systems for food and flavoring production.\n\n【122】 #Summary of Capture Efficiencies of Control Approaches\nProducing flavorings and flavored foods involves a variety of steps. These processes require the handling and manipulation of flavorings and flavoring compounds, which have been shown to be a point of exposure for employees.\n\n【123】 #Administrative Controls\nWork practices, an administrative control, are procedures followed by employers and employees to control hazards in the workplace. The emission of the volatile components in each flavoring mixture can be minimized by preventing spillage. To the extent possible, containers used to mix and store flavoring compounds should be covered when not in use. This practice will minimize the evaporation of chemicals into the workplace air and minimize likelihood of inadvertent spills. Manual handling of chemicals also provides a potentially significant source of employee exposures and emissions. Use of closed transfer processes, where feasible, significantly reduces exposure. Also, slow careful pouring/handling of chemicals can reduce splashing, spillage, and exposure during this activity . Reduction in spills and elimination of leakage from vessels aid in reducing the overall emission of chemicals into the workplace and lower employee exposure.\n\n【124】 #Good Housekeeping Practices\nAn organized, clean workplace enables faster and easier production, improves quality assurance, and reduces the potential for slips, trips, and falls. It is important to maintain good general housekeeping practices so that leaks, spills, and other process integrity problems are readily detected and corrected.\n\n【125】 #Reduced Process Temperatures for Priority Flavoring Compounds\nTo minimize volatilization, the temperature of diacetyl, 2,3-pentanedione, and other flavoring compounds in heated tanks should be maintained as low as production processes will allow, even when closed systems are used. Employers should make sure that:\nAll temperature-related equipment such as thermometers and automatic shutoff mechanisms are regularly checked to ensure that they are in good working order.  Tank thermometers and thermostats are calibrated at least monthly or as recommended by the manufacturer.  Employees take periodic manual temperature readings with a stem thermometer inserted just below the surface of the heated agents or with an infrared thermometer.\n\n【126】 #Cleaning Practices for Equipment and Tools\nWhere possible, cold water should be used to clean out tanks and blenders to reduce the volatilization of chemicals into plant air. Employees who are involved in cleaning or are working nearby should use appropriate PPE including respiratory protection, eye, and skin protection.\n\n【127】 #Limit Access to Priority Flavoring Compounds\nEmployers should structure work tasks to minimize the amount of time employees spend near priority chemicals and production processes that involve these chemicals. Employers should limit access to areas where diacetyl, 2,3-pentanedione, or other flavoring compounds are used to only those employees who are essential to the process or operation. These areas should be clearly marked with signage.\n\n【128】 #Safety and health programs\n\n【129】 In the 2,3-pentanedione inhalation study in rats, clinical observations documented that no clinical signs were present immediately after the 6 hour inhalation exposures to 318 or 354 ppm but respiratory signs were present in more than half of the rats at 18 hours post-exposure, when the rats were sacrificed .\nWhile both of these inhalation studies were not intended to produce lethality, contemporary laboratory animal studies frequently use early indicators of impending mortality rather than actual mortality for studies of lethality . The presence of extensive respiratory epithelial damage in 100% of the rats at exposures of approximately 294.6 ppm or greater for 6 hours in both of these studies and timedependent progressive respiratory clinical signs are considered a humane endpoint for use in place of mortality. In this case, expert scientific judgment needs to be used to determine the LC50 because of the humane considerations. Because all rats had high pathology scores after inhaling 294.6 ppm or higher, NIOSH concludes that the LC50 based on a 4-hour exposure would be 441 ppm (the 4-hr equivalent of 294.6 ppm) or less.\n\n【130】 #Classifying mixtures containing diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione\nThe HCS indicates that mixtures that contain compounds that require classification and labeling can be evaluated under a set of bridging principles if no toxicological data are available for the mixture itself. These bridging principles can be applied when there is \"sufficient data on both the individual ingredients and similarly tested mixtures to adequately characterize the hazards of the mixture\" [29  8-3 and 8-4), the specific cut-off values/ concentration limits specified by the HCS are ≥1%. Exceptions include the hazard category for \"serious eye damage/eye irritation\" (≥3%) and for \"flammable liquids,\" for which the HCS does not have a cut-off value/concentration limit. If these mixtures contain classified compounds below the specified HCS cut-off values/concentration limits, classification and labeling of those mixtures are not usually required. However, the standard indicates that \"while the adopted cut-off values/concentration limits adequately identify the hazard for most mixtures, there may be some that contain hazardous ingredients at lower concentrations than the specified cut-off values/concentration limits that still pose an identifiable hazard ,29 CFR 1910,29 CFR .1200. As explained below, this is an important consideration for mixtures containing diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione. FEMA has also recommended that this same warning should be used for containers of neat substances such as diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione as well as other \"high priority\" substances listed in the FEMA guidance document.\nAdditionally, FEMA has recommended that all containers of compounded flavors (liquid and dry or powdered) or natural flavoring complexes that contain diacetyl, 2,3-pentanedione or other flavoring substances in concentrations of >1.0% should be labeled with the above warning . It is of note that the use of the word \"warning\" in the FEMA text is inconsistent with the specific criteria for its use and application as a signal word in the HCS. NIOSH recommends removal of the word \"warning\" when using the FEMA text\n\n【131】 #Labeling and posting\nTo communicate hazard information effectively to employees, employers should:\nPost appropriate labeling on all flavoring product containers according to the HCS requirements ,29 CFR 1910,29 CFR .12\nIn this document, NIOSH is providing the recommended label elements, including signal word, hazard statements, and pictograms, that should be included for labeling of diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione on SDSs and labels for shipping containers ,see .\nIf an air-purifying respirator with cartridge/ canister for the protection against gases and vapors does not have an end-of-service-life indicator, then the employer is required to implement a cartridge/canister change schedule based on objective information that will ensure that the cartridges/canisters are changed before the end of their service life, according to the OSHA respiratory protection standard which was revised in 1998. The revised OSHA respiratory protection standard removed the previous method of determining the end of a cartridge's service life by using warning properties such as odor and irritation. A cartridge's useful service life is how long it provides adequate protection from the harmful chemicals in the air which are identified in the respirator approval. A change schedule to establish the time period for replacing respirator cartridges and canisters is the part of the written respirator program that is used to determine how often cartridges should be replaced. Data and information relied upon to establish the schedule should be included in the respirator program. The use of warning properties such as odor and irritation cannot be used as the sole basis for determining change schedules. However, respirator users should be trained to understand that they should leave the area if abnormal odor or irritation is experienced. The respirator should be checked to see if the odor or irritation is evidence that respirator cartridges need to be replaced or the respirator facepiece needs adjustment for better face seal fit.\n\n【132】 Diacetyl can cause skin and eye irritation. Chemical resistant gloves or sleeves or other appropriate protection for exposed skin should be used when handling liquid, paste, or powdered flavoring compounds containing diacetyl that could cause dermal injury . It is important to select the most appropriate chemical resistant glove for the application and to determine how long it can be worn, and whether it can be reused. Procedures should be implemented to ensure that the gloves are replaced before breakthrough occurs, Tight-fitting SCBA = Self-contained breathing apparatus - Maximum use concentrations will be lower than shown when those concentrations are equal to or exceed immediately dangerous to life and health levels.  The employer should have evidence provided by the respirator manufacturer that testing of these respirators demonstrates performance at a level of protection of 1,000 or greater to receive an assigned protection factor (APF) of 1,000. Absent such evidence, these respirators receive an APF of 25. Diacetyl and 2,3 . The ANSI standard was revised in 2010 . The current edition also includes respirators that cover the eyes and face as approvable under the standard.\n\n【133】 #Occupational Exposure to\nGoggles for chemical splash should be used for eye protection for employees with potential exposures to diacetyl, 2,3-pentanedione, or food flavorings containing these compounds who are not also required to wear a respirator with a full facepiece, hood, or helmet. Face shields can also be used in conjunction with goggles to shield the wearer's face, or portions thereof, in addition to the eyes for protection from liquid splash. Face shields should be worn only in conjunction with spectacles and goggles, as required by ANSI Z87. 1-20101- ,ANSI 20\nA face shield with a polyethylene terephthalate visor should provide good chemical resistance against diacetyl, 2,3-pentanedione, or food flavorings containing these compounds.\n\n【134】 An analysis should be performed on each operation involving diacetyl, 2,3-pentanedione, or other food flavoring compounds to assess the potential exposures and to establish specific guidance about when to use skin, eye, and face protection. CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) . Fixed obstructive lung disease among workers in the flavor-manufacturing industry -California, 20\nCDC .\n\n【135】 #Medical Monitoring\nMedical monitoring of employees, sometimes called medical screening, involves periodic medical follow up for early detection of workrelated disease. The intended benefit of early detection is to identify disease in early stages when steps can still be taken to prevent progression from pre-clinical to clinical disease or from milder to more symptomatic disease. This approach is called secondary prevention because it attempts to ameliorate or at least halt the progression of health effects that have already occurred. Evidence of early disease identified through medical monitoring serves as a sentinel event or warning that other employees might be at risk for the same exposures and outcomes. This warning should stimulate efforts to evaluate the workplace to identify possible risk factors for exposures that can be controlled. Systematic evaluation and use of medical monitoring data obtained from individual employees to better protect a population of employees is an important component of the overall medical surveillance program. This approach contributes to the goal of primary prevention, to prevent disease from developing in other employees.\n\n【136】 #Medical Surveillance\nThe systematic analysis of aggregated results over time constitutes medical (epidemiologic) surveillance of trends in symptoms or functional changes that can be assessed in relationship to jobs, tasks, and exposures .\nFor medical monitoring to serve surveillance purposes, a formal process should be in place to assure that data from a screened employee population is evaluated in aggregate at regular intervals. Epidemiologic analysis of medical\n\n【137】 #Medical Monitoring Program Director\nThe medical monitoring program director should be a licensed physician with training and experience in identifying and preventing occupational lung disease. This is because flavoring-related lung disease can progress rapidly and have grave consequences, so it is important to assure that the medical monitoring program director can quickly evaluate clinical data and make medical judgments about appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic measures, including medical removal. This individual (hereafter referred to as \"the medical monitoring program director\") should ensure that the monitoring program collects high quality data, including relevant questionnaire data and high quality spirometry tests that adhere to ATS/ERS technical guidelines for spirometry , or the most recent equivalent guidelines. The medical monitoring program director should also ensure that medical monitoring data is appropriately evaluated for surveillance purposes, including evaluation of aggregated results to identify risk factors and opportunities to better prevent flavoring-related lung disease.\nThe employer should ensure that the medical monitoring program director is familiar with the natural history of flavoring-related lung disease and is knowledgeable about operating a spirometry program that maintains high test accuracy, precision and validity. The employer should provide the following to the medical monitoring program director:\nA copy of the NIOSH Alert, \"Preventing Lung Disease in Workers Who Use or Make Flavorings\" ;  A copy of this criteria document;  A description of work areas, job categories, and work tasks;  A description of any personal protective equipment to be used by employees; and  Results of any environmental sampling related to potential flavorings exposures.\n\n【138】 #Employees to Include in the Medical Monitoring Program\nAll permanent, temporary, and contract employees who work in or enter areas where diacetyl, 2,3-pentanedione, or similar flavoring compounds or products that contain these compounds are used or produced should be included in the medical monitoring program. Employees who work in or enter these areas for a total of 40 or more hours per year should be included in the medical monitoring program.\nIn addition to production employees, employees who are periodically exposed such as supervisors, warehouse employees, laboratory employees, quality assurance/control employees, shipping and receiving employees, maintenance employees, janitorial employees, and office employees should also be included in the program, as employees with lung function abnormalities were identified in nonproduction jobs during several NIOSH HHE investigations .\nEmployees with past experience in such jobs or performing such duties should be included in the monitoring program for one year and longer if abnormalities are present .\nTo achieve the intent of primary and secondary prevention, employers have an interest in attaining a high rate of employee participation in regular medical monitoring. Voluntary participation should be encouraged at a time and place convenient to employees and should be provided at no cost to employees.\n\n【139】 #Medical Monitoring Program Elements\nThe medical monitoring evaluation should include a questionnaire to obtain health and exposure information and spirometry to assess lung function. The questionnaire data from all employees in a medical monitoring program should be entered into a database along with spirometry results for use in epidemiologic analyses for medical surveillance. These analyses may reveal associations between health outcomes and exposure variables such as work tasks and practices that can be addressed to decrease lung disease risk .\n\n【140】 #Questionnaire\nThe purpose of the questionnaire is to obtain standardized information on demographics, work history, exposures, personal risk factors such as smoking and health history.\nBecause employees with biopsy-documented obliterative bronchiolitis may have normal spirometry, chest symptoms such as exertional shortness of breath merit attention as suggestive of an occupational lung condition requiring employee education and follow up. Similarly, persons with abnormal spirometry, despite absent chest symptoms, may have occupational lung disease requiring attention.\nWork history questions should allow employees to correctly indicate the specific job titles they have held at their current employer. For each job title, the questionnaire should collect information on specific work tasks and practices that may affect the employee's exposure to diacetyl and similar flavoring compounds. For example, for an employee whose job requires direct handling of diacetyl-containing flavorings, specific questions might address how often a particular task is performed, the amounts of flavorings used, whether open or closed containers of flavorings are used, and whether respiratory protection is used, including the type of respirator used and when it is worn. To help the medical monitoring program director develop appropriate questions on jobs and exposures, the employer should provide the medical monitoring program director with the specific job titles of potentially exposed employees, a description of the work tasks for each job that may be associated with potential for exposure to diacetyl and similar flavoring compounds, and the types of personal protective equipment (e.g. respirators) and other measures that employees have available to them to minimize exposures in each job. A visit to the plant by the medical monitoring program director to view the production process may provide additional useful information for questionnaire development.\nThe questionnaire should contain questions on the presence or absence of respiratory symptoms such as shortness of breath on exertion, cough, and wheezing; respiratory illnesses such as asthma, emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and COPD; and the dates of diagnosis. Additional questions might inquire about work-related nasal, ocular, and dermal symptoms. The American Thoracic Society Respiratory Symptom Questionnaire While respiratory symptom information is important in the assessment of employees exposed to diacetyl and similar flavoring compounds or products that contain these compounds, the medical monitoring program director should not conclude that an employee's exposures are below harmful levels solely by the absence of respiratory symptoms. Employees may not experience respiratory symptoms early in the course of excessive lung function decline. NIOSH medical surveys of flavoring-exposed employees have identified airways obstruction  and excessive declines in lung function  in employees who did not report respiratory symptoms.\nSimilarly, about half of the employees with airways obstruction found in surveillance of California flavoring manufacturing employees had no chest symptoms . Absence of symptoms does not negate the need for clinical differential diagnosis and evaluation of employees with spirometric abnormalities.\n\n【141】 #Spirometry\nEvery employee in the medical monitoring program should have a spirometry test at each evaluation irrespective of respiratory symptom status. Evaluation of lung function over time is the most important component of medical monitoring for identifying possible workrelated lung disease in employees exposed to diacetyl and similar flavoring compounds . High quality spirometry tests are necessary to allow the medical monitoring program director to correctly interpret the results and make appropriate recommendations to the employee and the employer. Accurate spirometry measurements depend on four key elements:  a trained technician who can obtain valid test results,  a reliable and accurate spirometer,  an approved testing protocol, and  a spirometry quality assurance program directed by a laboratory supervisor or the medical monitoring program director.\n\n【142】 #Spirometer specifications\nSpirometry testing equipment should meet the ATS/ERS guidance for standardization of spirometry or most recent equivalent , specifications for spirometer accuracy and precision, and real-time display size and content. Written verification from a third party testing laboratory (not the manufacturer or distributor) that the model of spirometer being used has successfully passed its validation checks as required by the most current ATS/ ERS protocol should be requested from the spirometer manufacturer.\n\n【143】 #Spirometry testing protocol and reporting information\nAdministration of spirometry tests should follow the ATS/ERS guidance for standardization of spirometry or most recent equivalent\nTesting Procedures\n1. Spirometer calibration checks should be performed using a currently calibrated (per manufacturer recommendations) 3-liter syringe on each day of testing . A copy of the spirometer calibration report should be maintained in either electronic or hard copy form.\n2. Spirometry should be performed in the same documented position (either sitting or standing) during the baseline and all subsequent tests.\n3. A minimum of three forced exhalation maneuvers producing \"acceptable curves\" on the spirometry report should be characterized by the following:\nLack of hesitation (back-extrapolation volume should be less than 5% of FVC or 150 mL, whichever is larger)\nNo cough in the first second of the maneuver  No evidence of airflow cessation, variable effort, leak, obstructed mouthpiece, positive or negative zero flow error(s), or extra breath(s)\nAcceptable end-of-test criteria (≤ 25 mL increase in volume for 1 second or a maneuver longer than 15 seconds) 4. Less than 150 mL difference between the two highest FVC measurements and the two highest FEV 1 measurements is the goal.\n\n【144】 #Spirometry Predicted Values\nIf spirometry software allows a choice of predicted values, NHANES III or the most recent equivalent should be used  as they are based on a large sample of the U.S. population. Because predicted values are not available from NHANES III for Asian people born in the United States, these predicted values may be estimated by multiplying the NHANES III Caucasian predicted values for FEV 1 and FVC by 0.88 . In the future, it will be preferable to use Asian-specific equations for predicted values, such as from NHANES Plus data, when they are available.\nThe investigators also provided ongoing review of the quality of their tests and gave feedback to the technicians; additional technician training was provided as needed. Test quality in these studies was graded using an A, B, C, D, F scale.\nIn a study of a workplace spirometry testing program, use of a new spirometer that provided technicians with feedback during the test led to increases in the mean FEV 1 and mean FVC of the study group, compared to use of an older spirometer without feedback capability .\nWith poor quality tests, some employees' results that are truly normal may be considered abnormal, and employers may incur costs for lost work time in follow-up testing and clinical evaluation. In addition, employees may suffer needless worry, risks of unnecessary medical tests, and may be subject to workplace discrimination or even job loss. An example of an incorrect interpretation due to a poor quality test is the finding of a restrictive abnormality because the test subject did not exhale long enough during the maneuver; this results in a falsely low FVC. High quality spirometry tests are also necessary for comparison of spirometry results over time, an important consideration for flavoring-exposed employees. Low quality spirometry has greater variability in test results; over time, decreased precision may cause the medical monitoring program director to incorrectly identify whether an employee has had an excessive decline in lung function from one test to the next.\nIn reviewing the quality of spirometry tests performed for employers by private healthcare providers, NIOSH has identified instances where the quality of most tests was poor and thus not useful for assessing lung function changes over time Kreiss et al. 2012;NIOSH 2004bNIOSH , 2006. High quality spirometry minimizes the variability in the results caused by technical aspects (i.e. how the test was conducted) so that changes in spirometry measurements over time reflect true changes in lung function more accurately. In California public health surveillance, only one of 13 commercial providers of surveillance spirometry for flavoring employees who reported results to the California Department of Public Health met a minimum quality criterion of 80% of test sessions with FEV 1 of good quality . Employers of flavoring-exposed employees should be aware of the characteristics of high quality spirometry programs so they can evaluate the quality of spirometry services offered by medical providers, monitor performance, and take corrective actions if necessary. OSHA and NIOSH have published an information sheet on spirometry for employers .\n\n【145】 #Frequency of Medical Monitoring Evaluations\nNewly hired employees and current employees should have baseline evaluations before they are allowed to work in or enter areas as previously described where they may be exposed to diacetyl, 2,3-pentanedione, or similar flavoring compounds. Employees in the medical monitoring program should be evaluated with a questionnaire and spirometry every 6 months due to the potentially rapid development of flavoring-related lung disease . If an employee exposed to diacetyl or similar flavoring compounds is identified as likely having lung disease from this exposure, then all employees who perform similar job tasks or have a similar or greater potential for exposure should be evaluated every 3 months.\n\n【146】 #Reporting Medical Monitoring Results\nThe medical monitoring program director or designee should review and interpret questionnaire and spirometry results, including assessing spirometry quality. During an employee's scheduled visit for a medical monitoring program evaluation, the medical monitoring program director or designee should inquire about the employee's knowledge of the potential risk from exposure to diacetyl, 2,3-pentanedione, or similar flavoring compounds and of how to minimize the risk.\nThe medical monitoring program director should inform the employer in writing of the following:\nAny recommendations for limiting the employee's workplace exposures (e.g. reducing exposure to diacetyl, 2,3-pentanedione, or similar flavoring compounds by removal, or limitations of the employee's duties or activities) or on the employee's use of personal protective equipment  A statement that the physician has informed the employee of the results of the medical examination and any medical conditions that require further evaluation or treatment.\n\n【147】 #Early Identification of Affected Employees\nEarly recognition of employees with lung disease due to exposure to diacetyl, 2,3-pentanedione, or similar flavoring compounds is essential to prevent rapid progression to severe irreversible disease. Identifying affected employees will also stimulate prevention efforts so that risk to other employees is minimized. The most effective means for identifying affected employees early is careful evaluation of results of serial spirometry tests of employees in the medical monitoring program. Symptom reports alone are not a reliable indicator of early disease, as many employees with early disease will be asymptomatic. However, symptom reports of exertional shortness of breath can reflect pathologic obliterative bronchiolitis even when spirometry remains normal .\nAt each evaluation of an employee in the medical monitoring program, the medical monitoring program director should compare the results of the current spirometry test to the baseline (pre-exposure) test, or to the test with the highest values if post-hire spirometry values were higher than at baseline. The most important finding that may indicate development of lung disease from exposure to diacetyl, 2,3-pentanedione, or similar flavoring compounds is an abnormal decline in the FEV 1  While such test results might not meet the criteria for an abnormality such as airways obstruction or spirometric restriction, an abnormal decline in FEV 1 may indicate early disease in this case and should be further evaluated. Additionally, any new abnormality on spirometry compared to baseline should prompt further evaluation.\nFlavoring-exposed employees with obstructive abnormalities (FEV 1 /FVC ratio and FEV 1 less than the LLofN) need additional medical tests to assess whether they have obliterative bronchiolitis. Employees with restrictive abnormalities (FVC less than LLofN and normal FEV 1 /FVC ratio) also need additional medical tests to differentiate between nonlung causes and lung causes of spirometric restriction, including obliterative bronchiolitis .\nThe criteria for an abnormal excessive decline in the FEV 1 depend on the quality of the spirometry tests performed as part of the medical monitoring program and the time period of follow-up . ATS/ERS and ACOEM have stated that a decline in FEV 1 over one year should exceed 15% before being considered clinically meaningful Townsend 2011. By this criterion, someone with a baseline FEV 1 of 4 liters would 234 Occupational Exposure to Diacetyl and 2,3-Pentanedione have to experience a decline of at least 600 mL for the results to be considered abnormal.\nBecause lung disease caused by flavorings can progress rapidly, it is useful to identify those potentially at risk before so much lung function is lost NIOSH 2006NIOSH , 2007. Some studies indicate that when ATS/ ERS criteria for spirometry quality are followed and high standards of quality are achieved, a threshold less than 15% can indicate an abnormally rapid decline in FEV 1 in a year. In a study that used data from a spirometry surveillance program for coal miners, Wang and Petsonk  found that the 5th percentile for FEV 1 declines over 6 months in all employees studied was 320 mL (7.8%). In stable employees (those employees whose FEV 1 slope over 5 years was less than 90 mL/year), it was 300 mL (7.1%).\nIn healthy employees (those employees without symptoms or methacholine responsiveness over 5 years), it was 280 mL (6.5%). The quality of spirometry data in this study reflected a withinperson variation of 3% that is rarely achievable. Within-person variation of 6% is typical for spirometry programs, and an assumption of that level of variability was used by ATS to develop its recommendation for using 15% loss of FEV 1 as a threshold .\nIn another study that used data with a withinperson variation of 4% from a spirometry surveillance program for thousands of employees at a large chemical company, Wang et al.  found that the 5th percentile values for FEV 1 decline for testing at one-year intervals were 380 mL (10.4%) in men and 280 mL (10.6%) in women. These studies suggest that in a medical monitoring program that follows ATS/ERS criteria and achieves high quality spirometry, an FEV 1 decline of 10% or higher in one year or less can be considered abnormal and used as a threshold for further medical evaluation of the employee. ACOEM now accepts this 10% criterion after allowing for expected average annual loss due to aging in high risk settings when the relationship between longitudinal results and endpoint disease is clear, as in flavoring-exposed employees . Lower quality spirometry programs have the disadvantage of only being able to detect larger declines in FEV 1 as abnormal.\nNIOSH has developed a computer program, SPIROLA, to help spirometry programs measure their within-person variation in FEV 1 as a measure of the precision of spirometry obtained by the spirometry providers (an indication of spirometry quality across the providers' programs). SPIROLA also provides a longitudinal limit of decline (LLD) for each individual tested, a threshold for determining abnormal loss of FEV 1 that is adjusted for the quality of the provider's spirometry program . The LLD allows the spirometry provider to determine if an individual's serial spirometry results suggest an excessive decline in lung function and allows higher quality programs to identify smaller changes in lung function as abnormal .\n\n【148】 #Continuity of Medical Monitoring\nEmployers may change medical providers of medical monitoring services. Employers should ensure that prior medical monitoring program directors transfer medical monitoring records, including spirometry tests and questionnaires, to new medical monitoring program directors.\nIf necessary to gain access, employers or new providers should ask employees to sign releases allowing new providers to obtain previous medical monitoring and surveillance records from previous provider(s).\nOccupational Exposure to Diacetyl and 2,3-Pentanedione 235 The first step in evaluating an employee whose medical monitoring spirometry test shows either an excessive decline in FEV 1 (even if individual test results are still above the LLofN) or a new abnormality (e.g. obstructive, restrictive, or mixed spirometric abnormality) compared to baseline is to repeat the test within one month to confirm the change. If the repeat spirometry test confirms an excessive decline in FEV 1 or other abnormality, the employee should be referred for more extensive pulmonary function tests (PFTs) (described below).\nThe medical monitoring program director may request these and other necessary tests or refer the employee to a pulmonary medicine physician at no cost to the employee.\n\n【149】 #Other Pulmonary Function Tests\nThe referred employee should receive complete PFTs that include spirometry with an assessment of bronchodilator response, DLCO, and static lung volumes. Most employees who have developed lung disease while being exposed to diacetyl and similar flavoring compounds have not had a response to bronchodilator Kim et al. 2010. In other words, they had fixed airways obstruction with an FEV 1 and/or FVC increase less than 12% and 200 mL after bronchodilator . DL CO in affected employees with airways obstruction has usually been normal, although some individuals with advanced disease have had a low DL CO .\nLung volume measurements have shown a normal or elevated total lung capacity (TLC) and an increased residual volume, consistent with air trapping . Individuals with moderate to severe airways obstruction may have a mixed obstructive/ restrictive (reduced FEV 1 , FEV 1 /FVC ratio, and FVC) pattern of spirometry because air trapping decreases the FVC. The actual underlying physiology can be clarified by determining lung volumes.\n\n【150】 #High-resolution Computerized Tomography\nOther common findings include cylindrical bronchiectasis, bronchial wall thickening, and a mosaic pattern of attenuation. Centrilobular nodules may also be seen . Patchy ground glass opacities have been observed less commonly. These findings may not be present despite obliterative bronchiolitis documented by biopsy . HRCTs have not been systematically performed in flavoring-exposed employees with restrictive pulmonary function abnormalities or with excessive FEV 1 declines within the normal range of FEV 1 . Specialist consideration of the diagnostic utility of this test is suggested.\n\n【151】 #Lung Biopsy\nIt is not routinely necessary to obtain a lung biopsy to diagnose obliterative bronchiolitis in employees exposed to diacetyl or 2,3-pentanedione when spirometry and HRCT results are consistent with the diagnosis. While some physicians might desire biopsy confirmation, it is important to recognize that the patchy nature of obliterative bronchiolitis and lack of familiarity of some pathologists with the techniques necessary to identify bronchiolar lesions may prevent identification of the disease on biopsy. HRCT has become the method of choice for assessing 236 Occupational Exposure to Diacetyl and 2,3-Pentanedione bronchiolar morphology, often replacing surgical lung biopsy .\nPhysicians caring for another population at high risk for obliterative bronchiolitis, lung transplant patients, use a similar noninvasive approach. Obliterative bronchiolitis commonly occurs after patients receive a lung transplant. Because this disease is difficult to identify on biopsy, the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation developed a clinical description for the disease termed bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome. The syndrome refers to graft deterioration secondary to persistent airflow obstruction as defined by pulmonary function changes with or without biopsy confirmation . The term bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome has also been applied to flavoring-exposed employees without surgical lung biopsies ; , but may lead to confusion because flavoring-related obliterative bronchiolitis differs in natural history from post-transplant bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome, which is relentlessly progressive.\n\n【152】 #Determining Diagnosis Responsible for Lung Disease\nDetermination of the diagnosis responsible for lung disease in an employee exposed to diacetyl, 2,3-pentanedione, or similar flavoring compounds should take into account the changes identified in medical monitoring spirometry tests, the results of complete PFTs and of HRCT scans of the chest, the course of the employee's illness over time, and medical, work, and personal risk factor history.\nWhen clinically apparent lung disease occurs in several employees at a particular plant, the need for biopsy confirmation in each employee is usually unnecessary.\nWhen HRCT is normal in dyspneic employees, particularly if the PFTs are restrictive or normal, lung biopsy has a role. Some medical surveys of flavoring-exposed employees have revealed an increased prevalence of an isolated restrictive pattern on spirometry (i.e. without concurrent airways obstruction), but static lung volume measurements of TLC and biopsies have not been available in these studies to confirm restrictive lung disease , many pulmonary and occupational medicine specialists are not aware of the range of spirometric findings in this disease and may be reluctant to diagnose obliterative bronchiolitis in patients with spirometric restriction or normal spirometry without pathologic confirmation. Employees who develop restrictive abnormalities or who have excessive parallel FEV 1 and FVC declines should have assessment of lung volumes, diffusing capacity, and HRCT to differentiate between restrictive lung disease and other causes of restrictive spirometric patterns. Further evaluation of restrictive lung disease for a specific diagnosis should be pursued as clinically appropriate and may require biopsy. Case reports of pathologic findings in dyspneic flavoring-exposed employees with restrictive or normal spirometry will be of interest in further guidance for clinicians responsible for the lung health of such employees.\nThe evaluating physician should exclude alternative causes of respiratory disease such as work-related asthma (new onset asthma or exacerbation of pre-existing asthma). An employee with no past asthma history who experiences post-hire recurrent respiratory symptoms and has airways obstruction responsive to bronchodilator on PFTs (reversible airways obstruction) may have new onset asthma due to workplace exposures. If an employee with asthma symptoms does not have changes over time on medical monitoring spirometry, a methacholine or mannitol challenge test may be necessary to determine if the employee has airways hyperresponsiveness as occurs in asthma.\nWorsening symptoms in an employee with pre-existing asthma may be due to exposure to diacetyl, similar flavoring compounds, or other agents in the workplace . An important consideration for diacetyl-exposed employees with worsening pre-existing asthma or new onset reversible airways obstruction is that this may actually reflect early disease that may ultimately progress to clinical obliterative bronchiolitis. An employee at a California flavoring plant who had stable pre-existing asthma (no symptoms at time of hire) developed progressive shortness of breath and was found to have severe fixed airways obstruction on PFTs; a lung biopsy showed evidence of bronchiolitis obliterans  However, because HRCT abnormalities may be insensitive in detecting early or mild disease, such asthmatic employees require careful and frequent follow-up .\nAn employee exposed to diacetyl, 2,3-pentanedione, or similar flavoring compounds who has normal pre-exposure spirometry and subsequently develops fixed airways obstruction and has evidence of air trapping on complete PFTs or on HRCT scan, or has an excessive decline in FEV 1 and whose pulmonary function does not improve after exposure cessation, likely has clinical obliterative bronchiolitis due to this exposure.\nSmoking explains about 80% of COPD in the United States, with about 15% attributable to work exposures. Smoking diacetyl-exposed employees appear to have lower excess risk of obstruction than never-smoking flavoringexposed employees .\nOccupational Exposure to Diacetyl and 2,3-Pentanedione\n\n【153】 #Response to Identification of Workrelated Lung Disease\nEmployees with abnormalities identified on medical monitoring spirometry should be counseled about the risks of further exposure and that removal from exposure is prudent because of the irreversibility of the disease, short latency, and often rapid progression.\nEmployees who receive a diagnosis of flavoringrelated lung disease or who have findings on medical evaluation that indicate likely clinical obliterative bronchiolitis or other lung disease due to workplace exposures should be placed on work restrictions to prevent any further exposure to flavoring compounds or other substances in the workplace that may cause their lung disease to worsen. Personal protective equipment is the least effective means for controlling employee exposures. The proper use of personal protective equipment requires a high level of employer and employee involvement and commitment to be effective. The use of respiratory protection is not equivalent to removal from exposures because employees may still be exposed due to incomplete compliance, selection of an inappropriate respirator, or respirator malfunction . If possible, employers should offer affected employees the opportunity to transfer to available jobs in work areas that have minimal or nonexistent exposures. Such employees should retain seniority, wages, and benefits.\nWhen informed, employers should record all flavoring-related lung disease cases in the OSHA Form 300 Logs of Work-Related Injuries and Illnesses.\n\n【154】 #Medical Surveillance Analyses\nA workplace assessment conducted after identification of a sentinel case of work-related lung disease may reveal sources of uncontrolled exposures from particular aspects of production processes and work practices that can be improved to prevent other employees from becoming affected. However, this approach may not identify all such risk factors for hazardous exposure in a given workplace. Additional risk factors may be identified through a medical monitoring and surveillance program, which includes the use of epidemiologic techniques for analyses of aggregated data obtained from evaluations of all employees in a medical monitoring program. Such analyses show trends and distributions of health outcomes by exposure variables such as work area, job category, and work task. In some instances, the results of such analyses may provide early evidence of risk factors that can be addressed before employees develop significant lung disease.\nBecause production processes and work practices in manufacturing plants that use diacetyl or similar flavoring compounds or products that contain these compounds vary from plant to plant, medical surveillance may also allow identification of risk factors unique to a particular plant. For these reasons, systematic evaluation of medical monitoring data is an important component of medical monitoring and surveillance programs for employees exposed to diacetyl or similar flavoring compounds. If the medical monitoring program director is not able to conduct such analyses, the employer or medical monitoring program director should arrange for consultants with expertise in epidemiology to undertake this task. Two examples below show how medical surveillance can help to identify lung disease risk factors in the workplace.\nExample 1. At the plant where microwave popcorn employees were first identified as being at risk for severe fixed airways obstruction consistent with clinical obliterative bronchiolitis from exposure to butter flavoring vapors (index facility G), four known affected former employees had worked in the mixing room as mixers of oil and butter flavorings, and four other affected former employees had worked on the packaging lines near the mixing room.\nA medical survey of current employees showed that the prevalence of airways obstruction on NIOSH spirometry tests was 3.3 times higher than expected in comparison to U.S. population data, a finding that was consistent with the known disease in former employees. The environmental assessment showed that air concentrations of the butter flavoring compound diacetyl were highest in the mixing room. The next highest exposures were in the packaging line area because of contamination from the mixing room, which was not isolated from the rest of the plant. Diacetyl air concentrations in other parts of the plant were lower. Analyses of the medical and environmental data showed a dose-response relationship between abnormal spirometry and quartiles of estimated cumulative exposure to diacetyl NIOSH 20\nAdditional analyses of the medical survey data revealed an unexpected finding: Among current employees, the highest prevalence of airways obstruction was found in QC laboratory employees, five of six (83%) of whom had airways obstruction . These employees popped approximately 100 bags of microwave popcorn in microwave ovens per 8-hour shift. The mean time-weighted average diacetyl air concentration in the QC laboratory was 0.8 ppm compared to approximately 57.2 ppm in the mixing room and 2.8 ppm for machine operators in the packaging line area. QC laboratory employees may be at risk for lung disease because they experience intermittent peak exposures to vapors of diacetyl from microwave popcorn bags during and after popping in microwave ovens; mixers experience similar intermittent peaks when they add butter flavorings to tanks of heated oil . Another possible explanation is that the much higher temperatures that occur in microwave popping (compared with the temperatures in heated tanks of oil and butter flavorings) increase the volatilization of other chemicals. QC laboratory employees' exposures may be substantially different from those of other production employees; diacetyl air concentrations alone may not be a satisfactory predictor of risk for these employees. Because of this evidence of risk to QC laboratory employees, NIOSH recommended implementing exposure controls in the QC laboratory in addition to the mixing room and packaging line area NIOSH 20\nIn evaluations at five other microwave popcorn plants, NIOSH found evidence of affected mixers in four plants and evidence of affected packaging line employees in one plant . No other plant had an elevated prevalence of airways obstruction in QC employees. Fewer bags of microwave popcorn were popped per employee per day in those plants, and the mean time-weighted average diacetyl air concentrations in the QC laboratories were lower than at index facility G.\nOccupational Exposure to Diacetyl and 2,3-Pentanedione Example 2. At a microwave popcorn plant where a young mixing room employee developed moderately severe fixed airways obstruction and other findings consistent with clinical obliterative bronchiolitis, management had put a mandatory respirator use policy for mixing room employees in place soon after the company first started production. In addition to using respirators, the company had also ventilated and isolated the mixing room from the rest of the plant and had local exhaust ventilation for tanks of heated oil and butter flavorings. Butter flavorings were handled in open containers as they were at other microwave popcorn plants. The respirators used were full facepiece respirators with organic vapor cartridges and particulate filters. Included in the questionnaire that NIOSH administered to current employees during a medical survey at the plant were questions about respirator use for the following work tasks:  weighing or handling open containers of flavorings,  pouring flavorings into tanks in the mixing room,  pouring other ingredients into tanks in the mixing room,  checking the levels in the tanks, and  other duties in the mixing room. Thirteen current employees reported ever having worked as a mixer; six had abnormal lung function on NIOSH spirometry tests. The reported percentages of time these employees used respirators during these activities ranged from 0% to 100%. The median reported percentage of time was 20% for all activities, except for those where other ingredients (not flavorings) were poured into tanks in the mixing room where the median was 50% . These results showed that employees were not fully compliant with management's respirator use policy; management was able to address this problem through employee education and enforcement of the policy. Had the company become aware of this problem earlier by regularly collecting and evaluating information on respirator use during medical monitoring evaluations, it could have increased compliance with respirator use and thus minimized some employees' exposures to butter flavoring compounds.\n(Before 2001 when NIOSH informed microwave popcorn companies of the risk of severe lung disease to employees exposed to butter flavorings, the company had been unaware of the respiratory toxicity potential of diacetyl. The company had implemented a mandatory respirator use policy for mixing room employees many years earlier to prevent severe eye irritation that employees had experienced when handling certain flavorings.) Thus, analysis of population data generated by medical monitoring and surveillance programs plays an important role in primary prevention by helping employers of flavoring-exposed employees to recognize and take steps to characterize and correct hazardous conditions. Recognition can require epidemiologic evaluation of medical monitoring, population, and environmental data. It is therefore important for employers to ensure that this applied epidemiology is provided as part of the medical monitoring and surveillance program. Employers should develop and implement comprehensive occupational safety and health programs to prevent occupational injuries, illnesses, and deaths. To be successful, safety and health programs should be developed and implemented as part of an employer's management system, with strong management commitment, employee involvement, and occupational safety and health expertise. A safety and health program designed to protect employees from the adverse effects of exposure to diacetyl, 2,3-pentanedione, and other flavoring compounds should include mechanisms to identify all risk factors for exposure to flavoring substances. Just as medical monitoring is part of an overall occupational safety and health program, so is exposure monitoring. Exposure monitoring should be conducted whenever there is workplace exposure to diacetyl or 2,3-pentanedione.\n\n【155】 #Exposure Monitoring Program Goals\nA workplace exposure monitoring program should have clear, stated goals . Site-specific exposure assessment strategies should be developed to accomplish each of these goals:  to determine employee exposure to diacetyl, 2,3-pentanedione, and other flavoring compounds used in the workplace;\n\n【156】 #Exposure Monitoring Program Elements\nProper measurement of contaminants in the environment involves a variety of program elements. Several of the more significant elements of a monitoring program are described below .\nWhere possible, a written sampling strategy or protocol should be developed prior to sampling; this protocol should guide all aspects of the sampling process. The protocol should contain a description of  the objectives of sampling,  what to sample,  whom and where to sample,  how to sample,  when to 246Occupational Exposure to Diacetyl and 2,3-Pentanedione sample,  how long to sample,  how many samples to collect, and  how to handle, store, and ship samples . A walk-through survey or preliminary worksite visit is often useful in developing the sampling strategy  and knowledge of the data-keeping system to be used to store and retrieve subsequent information can also have an effect.\nThe sampling strategy should be developed to facilitate data analysis and interpretation for the specific exposure assessment goal.\n\n【157】 #Objectives of Sampling\nSampling as part of an exposure monitoring program for diacetyl, 2,3-pentanedione, and other flavoring substances has several objectives. Often, this sampling is part of a comprehensive assessment to identify and quantify exposure hazards throughout a designated plant or work area to protect employees' health. The frequency of monitoring will depend on the purpose and rationale of the sampling campaign. Specific sampling objectives can include:\nCharacterizing (qualitatively or quantitatively) the flavoring compounds present in workplace air or in bulk materials  Ensuring compliance with existing OELs  Assessing the effectiveness of engineering controls, work practices, PPE, training, or other methods used for exposure control  Identifying areas, tasks, or jobs with higher exposures that require additional exposure control  Evaluating exposures related to production process changes and from changes in products made or materials used  Evaluating specific high risk job categories to ensure that exposures do not exceed exposure standards or guidelines  Measuring exposures of employees who report symptoms or illnesses Sampling can also be used to assess any fugitive emissions from plant processes into the surrounding community.\nExposure monitoring should be conducted by qualified professionals. The sampling strategy should provide an opportunity to determine each employee's exposure, either by direct measure using personal breathing zone samples or through reasonable estimates based on the sampling of similar work tasks or jobs. Sampling strategies that group employees according to exposure zones, uniform job titles, or functional job categories have been used in some industries to reduce the number of required samples while increasing the confidence that all employees at similar risk will be identified .\nArea sampling may also be useful in exposure monitoring for determining sources of airborne contaminants and assessing the effectiveness of engineering controls.\nWhen sampling to determine whether employee exposures are below an OEL, a compliance sampling strategy, and/or a \"focused strategy,\" that targets employees perceived to have the highest exposure concentrations may be more useful than random sampling. A focused strategy is most efficient for identifying exposures above the OEL if maximum-risk employees and time periods are accurately identified. Focused sampling may help identify short-duration tasks involving high airborne concentrations that could result in elevated exposures over a full work shift and also tasks that result in exposures over the STEL.\n\n【158】 #What to Sample (Specific Agents and Physical States)\nBecause flavorings can consist of many chemicals in addition to diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione, deciding what to sample often requires preliminary knowledge of the specific flavoring compounds being produced or used, or that are present in flavorings or other food ingredients used in the workplace, and the known exposure hazards posed by each. Information on possible food and flavoring compounds present in workplace air can be obtained from reviews of product ingredient lists, flavor or food recipes, SDSs, and other information provided by the employer or flavor manufacturer . In the flavor manufacturing industry, the recipe for each flavoring indicates the chemicals, solvents, and other ingredients used in the formulation. In the food manufacturing industry, this information may be available directly from the company or from SDSs for all flavorings and other ingredients used, although some flavoring SDSs do not list all potentially hazardous chemicals that may be present Often, qualitative characterization may be useful prior to quantitative measurement to better guide the selection of substances to measure in the workplace. A review of any past exposure assessment reports from the target workplace or similar workplaces, may also be helpful in selecting which agents to sample. In either case, a list of substances to which employees will potentially be exposed should be developed to help determine which of those compounds are the most critical to sample . In instances where a company has stopped using diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione in a flavor or food product, this list should include the butter flavor substances substituted for diacetyl or 2,3-pentanedione. Determining which chemicals to sample and measure should be based upon the chemical, physical, and toxicological properties as well as the chemical quantities in use Other databases that might prove helpful may include but are not limited to National Library of Medicine ,Hazardous Substances to represent the exposures of those groups .\nArea sampling may be useful for determining sources of airborne contaminants and identifying the worst-case chemical concentrations in various locations or processes. Selection of which employees or work locations should be sampled can help to characterize (confirm or refute) suspected areas of potential concern.\n\n【159】 #How to Sample\nA variety of methods are available to sample for diacetyl, 2,3-pentanedione, or other food and flavoring substances. These include  gas and vapor air methods,  methods to sample particulates in air,  direct reading and real-time methods for gases/vapors and for particulates,  evacuated container sampling methods,  particle size distribution methods,  bulk air methods, and  bulk material methods.\nSelecting appropriate sampling and analytical methods and using professionally accepted techniques maximize the validity of measurements of flavoring compounds in the work environment. While the state of the art in measuring diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione continues to evolve, the methods with the most veracity at the time of publication of this document are OSHA Methods 1012 and 1013 for diacetyl and OSHA Method 1016 for 2,3-pentanedione.\nTo minimize the likelihood of inaccurate results, sampling equipment should be maintained in reliable working order through proper care and maintenance. All equipment should be regularly inspected and cleaned; sampling pumps should be calibrated before and after each use. Because differences in pressure drop across the sampler affect flow rate, each sampling pump should be precalibrated and postcalibrated with the specific type of sampling media used for sampling.\nCareful record keeping in the field is also important Pertinent information such as sampling location, job category or task, air temperature, relative humidity, and possible interfering compounds in air should be documented. To avoid confusion in the laboratory, samples should be carefully labeled and accompanied by accurate paperwork. The exact sampling duration should be known to accurately calculate the sampled volume.\nDetermining the sampling duration from the recorded start and stop times assumes that the pump functions consistently over the entire sampling period. Occasional spot checks to verify proper sampler operation should be made throughout the sampling period.\nPersonnel performing field sampling should not overlook quality assurance procedures. The field sampling parameters, such as calibration checks and accurate timing, often affect precision and accuracy of the final result more than the measurement's parameters. Field personnel should devote time to learning the sampling and analytical methods and sampling equipment operation procedures prior to arriving at the sampling site. These methods usually specify the sampling media to be used, the correct flow rate and sample volume, as well as special precautions of sample handling, shipping, and possible interferences.\nBecause many modern analytical techniques are extremely sensitive, care should be taken to avoid contaminating field samples. Samples should not be stored or shipped with bulk materials that might spill or otherwise contaminate the field samples. The glassware or other containers used in sampling and shipping should be cleaned as recommended in the analytical method. For many sampling methods, the analytical laboratory requires submission of a specific number of blank samples with each set of samples to be analyzed; this number of samples is specific to the method. Blanks are used to mitigate the potential for unrecognized contamination due to media or sample handling . The two types of sample blanks are field blanks and media blanks. Field blanks are unopened new samplers or media taken to the sampling site and handled in every way like the actual samples, except that no air is drawn through them. Media blanks are simply unopened new samplers or media that are submitted to the laboratory with the samples (these blanks are not usually taken to the field). Additional blind field blanks, labeled as field samples, should be sent along with the field samples as a further check on the analysis. Another occasionally used quality control practice is to include spiked samples-samples with known amounts of flavoring substance addedalong with the other field samples sent to the laboratory for analysis. These spiked samples are often prepared by a separate laboratory and then included with the other field samples sent to the analytical laboratory. They are labeled as field samples so that the analytical laboratory is blinded to their identity as spiked samples.\nThe variety of types of direct-reading methods available for monitoring specific gases and vapors, as well as general contaminant concentration, is large and expanding. Detector tubes (short-term and long-term), also referred to as colorimetric indicator tubes, are widely used sampling devices for obtaining immediate, quantitative measures of gas or vapor concentrations in air. Also, aerosol monitors, integrating passive monitors for certain gases, and portable instrumentation for gas chromatography or infrared spectroscopy, are becoming more commonly used for measuring exposures to flavoring compounds . Many direct-reading instruments now used for personal or area measurements have evolved from laboratory or process control instruments. These types of monitoring techniques have significant advantages, although to date none of these methods has been validated for monitoring diacetyl, 2,3-pentanedione, or other flavoring compounds in the work environment.\n\n【160】 #When to Sample\nBecause of the considerable variation in exposure during the production of food or flavoring products, individuals conducting air sampling should coordinate with plant management to ensure that sampling is conducted when food or flavoring products of particular interest are being manufactured. Sampling several products or production runs may be necessary to better characterize exposures. Additionally, some products may be produced infrequently, and production schedules may change rapidly, so the timing of sampling can be challenging. Exposure monitoring should be conducted whenever changes in production processes, controls, work practices, or other conditions indicate a potential change in exposure conditions.\nIn order to determine compliance with STEL criteria, sampling should be done during tasks that are considered likely to produce the highest short-term exposures. A series of sequential or overlapping samples can be taken for 15-minute intervals to determine the maximum exposures.\n\n【161】 #How Long to Sample\nIn general, TWA exposures should be determined by collecting samples over a full work shift, for comparison with OELs and other toxicological data. Information on allowable sampling duration is given in validated sampling and analytical methods; depending on the method, in some instances it is necessary to collect multiple shorter-term samples to obtain an integrated full work-shift sample. Work shifts that exceed 8 hours require extended sampling duration.\nWhen the potential for exposure to diacetyl, 2,3-pentanedione, or flavoring compounds is sporadic throughout a work shift, shortterm or task-based sampling may be needed to replace or supplement full-shift sampling. Short-term samples for diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione can be collected for 15 minutes in duration. Data from these short-term measurements and other task-based sampling can provide valuable perspective on task-based exposures and on the effectiveness of various control techniques. They can also be used to evaluate exposures relative to a short-term exposure limit  such as the STEL values recommended for diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione.\n\n【162】 #How Many Samples to Collect\nThe numbers of samples to collect is important in that it relates to the confidence that can be placed in the exposure estimate. The number of samples needed for an accurate and reliable exposure assessment depends on the purpose of the sampling, the number of processes, work tasks or jobs to be evaluated, the variability inherent in the measured contaminant concentrations, sampling and analytical variability, and other factors. In most instances, time and budget constraints are major factors determining sample size. Statistical methods are available for calculating the minimum sample size needed to characterize a maximum risk employee exposure subgroup or to achieve a set degree of statistical confidence in the representativeness of an exposure measurement . Recently, exposure control banding and Bayesian decision analysis have been used to help support exposure assessment decisions with limited sample numbers .  As stated above, a monitoring strategy should assess the effectiveness of various methods used to control airborne flavoring substance concentrations and to identify areas or tasks that are associated with higher exposures to flavoring substances. A common technique for evaluating the effectiveness of controls is to compare the outcome of environmental measurements made prior to the installation of those controls with measurements made following that installation. A control technique can be judged, for example, to be 50% efficient if the post-installation contaminant concentration is half of the pre-installation concentration.\nThe TWA and STEL measurements of exposure to flavoring substances, made with the collection of personal breathing zone air samples, can be used to assess employees' exposures relative to an OEL.\nIf monitoring indicates that exposures have increased over past measurements, or exposures exceed the selected OELs, a thorough investigation of controls to identify problems and guide remedial actions is needed. Regular routine monitoring (e.g. yearly) will help ensure the continued effectiveness of controls. Employers should monitor employees in such a fashion that he has a high degree of confidence that a very high percentage of actual daily exposures are below the REL. In statistical terms, the employer should try to attain 95% confidence that no more than 5% of employee days are over the REL.\n\n【163】 #Notification of Employees\nEmployers should establish procedures for the timely notification of employees of their environmental monitoring results or results that represent their work group, any identified exposure hazards, and any subsequent actions taken based on this monitoring to reduce their exposures. Employees should be informed about any products or processes that may generate high concentrations of diacetyl, 2,3-pentanedione, or other flavoring compounds and any PPE and changes in work practices needed in response. Employers should ensure that employees understand this information and their role in helping to maintain a healthful workplace. Information should be conveyed in English and other languages as needed to ensure that all employees receive and comprehend this information.\n\n【164】 #Research Needs\nGeneral areas of need include environmental research to better measure and control exposures to flavoring substances, clinical and field studies on the epidemiology of flavoring-induced diseases, research related to personal protective equipment, and toxicological studies concerning the etiology of flavoring-related diseases.\n\n【165】 #Chromatography Team Industrial Hygiene Chemistry Division\nOSHA Salt Lake Technical Center\nThe purpose of this evaluation was to develop a sampling procedure for diacetyl that gave a better storage stability than did the NIOSH Method 2557, which used SKC Anasorb CMS as the sampling medial .The NIOSH method requires that the samples be refrigerated immediately after sampling, and the analysis be performed within 7 days. A more stable sampling media was desired for OSHA samples. The following media were tested at SLTC but all gave poor storage stability: coconut shell charcoal Lot 2000, 4-tert-butylcatechol coated charcoal, XAD-7, and OVS-7. Silica gel tubes (150mg/75 mg) were tried next and had an average storage recovery of 94.9% for samples stored at room temperature for 14 days.\n1.1.2 Toxic Effects.\nIn 2002, the CDC published a report in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) on employee exposures at a microwave popcorn factory in Missouri. A group of former employees had developed fi xed airways obstructive lung disease. All eight had a respiratory illness that resembled a rare lung disease called bronchiolitis obliterans. Some of the cases had such severe illness they were candidates for lung transplants. The main volatile organic chemical (VOC) found in the workplace atmospheres was diacetyl, which was used in a mixture of heated soybean oil, salt and flavorings to impart a butter flavoring to the popcorn. During NIOSH 's investigation of the facility, diacetyl was chosen as a marker compound for voe exposure. The MMWR publication reported that the geometric mean air concentration of diacetyl was 18 ppm in the room where the mixing tank was located, 1.3 ppm in the packaging area, and 0.02 in other areas of the plant. Of the eight former employees with severe respiratory illness, four were mi xers and four worked in packaging. The report concluded that \"workers exposed to flavorings at microwave popcorn factories are at risk for developing fi xed obstructive lung disease.\" The DLOP is measured as mass per sample and expressed as equivalent air concentrations, based on the recommended sampling parameters. Ten samplers were spiked with equal descending increments of analyte, such that the highest sampler loading was 3.7 µg diacetyl. This is the amount spiked on a sampler that would produce a peak approximately 3 times the response for a sample blank. These spiked samplers were analyzed with the recommended analytical parameters, and the data obtained used to calculate the required parameters (standard error of estimate and slope) for the calculation of the DLOP. The slope was 13.89 and the SEE was 41.82. The RQL is considered the lower limit for precise quantitative measurements.  RQL is determined from the regression line parameters obtained for the calculation of the DLOP, providing 75% to 125% of the analyte is recovered. The DLOP and RQL were 0.902 µg and 3.01 µg respectively Below is chromatogram of the RQL level.\n\n【166】 #.a\nAll safety practices that apply to the work area being sampled should be followed. The sampling equipment should be attached to the worker in such a manner that it will not interfere with work performance or safety.\n2.1 Apparatus 2.1.1 Samples are collected using a personal sampling pump calibrated, with the sampling device attached, to within ±5% of the recommended flow rate.\n2.1.2 Silica gel tubes: glass tube with both ends flame sealed, 70 mm x 6-mm i.d.\n\n【167】 #Reagents\nNone required .\n\n【168】 #Technique\n2.3.1 Immediately before sampling, break off the ends of the flame-sealed tube to provide an opening approximately half the internal diameter of the tube. Wear eye protection when breaking ends. Use tube holders to minimize the hazard of broken glass. All tubes should be from the same lot.\nDraw the air to be sampled directly into the inlet of the tube holder. The air being sampled is not to be passed through any hose or tubing before entering the sampling tube.\n2.3.4 After sampling for the appropriate time, remove the adsorbent tube and seal it with plastic end caps. Seal each sample end-to-end with an OSHA-21 form as soon as possible.\n\n【169】 #.Extraction efficiency\nThe extraction efficiency was determined by liquid-spiking silica gel tubes with diacetyl at 0.1 to 2 times the target concentration. These samples were stored overnight at ambient temperature and then extracted for 30 minutes with occasional shaking and analyzed. The mean extraction efficiency over the studied range was 99.1 %.\n2.8 Interferences (sampling) 2.8.1 There are no known compounds that will severely interfere with the collection of diacetyl.\n2.8.2 Suspected interferences should be reported to the laboratory with submitted samples.\n\n【170】 #Analytical Procedure\nAdhere to the rules set down in your Chemical Hygiene Plan.

For this evaluation 2-ml vials were used.\n3.2.5 GC grade nitrogen, air, and hydrogen.\n3.3 Standard preparation 3.3.1 Prepare working analytical standards by injecting micro liter amounts of diacetyl into volumetric flasks containing the extraction solvent. An analytical standard at a concentration of 0.530 mg/ml (5.3 µL/10 ml) is equivalent to 50 ppm based on a 3-l air volume. Stock standards were stored in amber vials at refrigerated temperature for stability.\n3.3.2 Bracket sample concentrations with working standard concentrations. If sample concentrations are higher than the concentration range of prepared standards, prepare and analyze additional standards, at least as high a concentration as the highest sample, to ascertain the linearity of response, or dilute the sample with extracting solvent to obtain a concentration within the existing standard range. The range of standards used in this study was from 0.00132 to 0.60 mg/ml analyze additional standards, at least as high a concentration as the highest sample, to ascertain the linearity of response, or dilute the sample with extracting solvent to obtain a concentration within the existing standard range.

The sampling equipment should be attached to the worker in such a manner that it will not interfere with work performance or safety.\n\n【174】 #1 Apparatus\nSamples are collected with two tubes in series. The tubes consist of 110-cm x 7-mm o.d.\nFrom the front to back, the sampler consists of a silane-treated glass wool plug, glass fiber filter, 600 mg specially cleaned silica gel, and a second silane-treated glass wool plug.\nUse aluminum foil, opaque tape, or a tube holder, such as SKC, to protect samples from light.\n\n【175】 #Reagents\nNone required\n\n【176】 #Technique\nImmediately before sampling, break off both ends of the flame-sealed tube to provide an opening approximately half the internal diameter of the tube. Wear eye protection when breaking the tube. Use tube holders to minimize the hazard of broken glass and to protect tubes from light exposure during sampling. All tubes should be from the same lot.\n\n【177】 There was no acetoin or diacetyl on the back-up tube when a 15 min sample was taken at 0.2 Umin. The 5% breakthrough air volumes for a flow rate of 0.2 Umin were determined to be 11.98 L for diacetyl and greater than 13 L for acetoin.\nExtraction efficiency  It is the responsibility of each analytical laboratory to determine the extraction efficiency of the analyte from the media because the adsorbent material, internal standard, reagents and laboratory techniques may be different than those listed in this evaluation and influence the results.\nExtracted samples remain stable for at least 24 h.\nRecommended sampling time and sampling rate Sample with dried silica gel tubes for up to 180 min at 0.05 Umin (9 L) to collect TWA (long term) samples, and for 15 min at 0.2 Umin (3 L) to collect short-term samples.\nWhen short-term samples are collected, the air concentration equivalent to the reliable quantitation limit becomes larger. For example, the reliable quantitation limits for dried silica gel tubes for a 15 min sample taken at 0.2 Umin are 0.0044 ppm ,0.016 mg/m\n\n【178】 #Low humidity\nThe ability of dried silica gel tubes to collect the analytes from a relatively dry atmosphere was determined by sampling an atmosphere containing two times the target concentration and at an average relative humidity of 20% RH at 23 °C. The mean recoveries (% of theoretical) were 98. 7% for acetoin and 98.5% for diacetyl.\n\n【179】 #Low concentration\nThe ability of dried silica gel tubes to collect the analytes at low concentrations was tested by sampling an atmosphere at 0. 1 times the target concentration with at an average relative humidity of 80% RH at 23 °C. The mean recoveries (% of theoretical) were 99.0% for acetoin and 98.4% for diacetyl.  Sampling interference\nThe ability of dried silica gel tubes to collect the analyte when other potential interferences are present was tested under two separate series of tests. The first test was an atmosphere similar to ones found at some popcorn manufacturing plants consisting of acetoin and diacetyl at the target concentration with an interference mixture of acetaldehyde, acetic acid, and methyl ethyl ketone at an average humidity of 80% at 23 °C. All three of these interferences can react with PFBHA. The concentrations of the analytes in this test atmosphere were: 0.051 ppm ,0.184 mglm The concentrations of these interferences are much higher than would normally be expected in a food or flavoring manufacturing workplace. The PFBHA extraction solution needed to be modified to 18 mg/mL PFBHA (72. 1 µmoles/mL) to insure that there was enough PFBHA to derivatize all the analytes. These interferences and acetoin react fully within 4 hours of extraction, but the diacetyl requires 36 hours to fully react. These three test atmospheres each contained the one of the followinq concentrations of interference: 190 ppm (350 mg/m 3 ) acetaldehyde, 9.49 ppm (23.3 mglm) acetic acid, or 190 ppm (560 mglm 3 ) methyl ethyl ketone. These three compounds were chosen because they can collect onto the dried silica gel tubes and can react with the PFBHA. For each test, three sampling trains had contaminated air (air containing the analytes and an interference) drawn through them at 0.05 Umin for 180 min for each test. All of the samples were immediately analyzed.\n\n【180】 #Analytical Procedure\nAdhere to the rules set down in your Chemical Hygiene Plan\nAvoid skin contact and inhalation of all chemicals and review all MSDSs before beginning this analytical procedure.\n\n【181】 #1 Apparatus\nGas chromatograph equipped with an electron capture detector.

The highest amount is the amount spiked on the sampler that would produce a peak approximately 10 times the response of a sample blank. These spiked samplers and the sample blank were analyzed with the recommended analytical parameters, and the data obtained used to calculate the required parameters (slope and standard error of estimate) for the calculation of the DLOP.\nFor acetoin, the slope and standard error of estimate, respectively, were 46. 9 and 227. For diacetyl,the\nThe standard error of estimate was determined from the linear regression of data points from standards over a range that covers 0.25 to 2 times the TWA target concentration.\nacetoin and 0. 050 ppm (0. 180 mg/m 3 ) diacetyl. Thirty-three storage samples were prepared. Three samples were analyzed on the day of generation. At 3 to 4-day intervals, three samples were selected from each of the two storage sets and analyzed. Fifteen of the tubes were stored at reduced temperature (4 °C) and the other fifteen were stored in a closed drawer at ambient temperature (about 23 °C).\nAt 22% RH ambient and refrigerated storage samples showed no migration for acetoin or diacetyl. Recoveries are not corrected for extraction efficiency. At the beginning of this method, the SKC 226-183 tubes were available as a 4001200 mg tube.\nMigration studies showed that it would be necessary to use two tubes in series, so subsequent tubes were packed as a single 600 mg tube.\nSince the short term sampling may be a time of higher exposure, two higher concentrations were also tested. The first was 0.541 ppm (1.95 ) diacetyl at an average relative humidity of 79% at 23 °C. In all of these tests there was no acetoin or diacetyl on the back-up tube of the sampling train.\n\n【184】 #8 Extraction efficiency and stability of extracted samples\nThe extraction efficiency is dependent on the extraction solvent as well as the internal standard. The extraction solvent used for this evaluation consisted of 95:5 ethyl alcohol:water with 2 mg/mL PFBHA and 20 µg/mL 4-bromobenzyl bromide. Other extraction solvents or internal standards may be used provided that the new extraction solution or internal standard is tested.\nThe new extraction solvent or internal standard should be tested as described below.\n\n【185】 #Extraction efficiency\nThe extraction efficiencies of acetoin and diacetyl were determined by liquid-spiking four dried silica gel tubes, at each concentration level, with the analyte from the RQL to 2 times the target concentration. These samples were stored overnight at ambient temperature and then analyzed. The samples need to be extracted on a rotator for 1 hour, and then allowed to set at room temperature for 36 hours. Do not use a shaker as recoveries will be much lower . The mean extraction efficiency over the working range from the RQL to 2 times the target concentration is 102.0% for acetoin and 97.6% for diacetyl. The extraction efficiency for the wet samplers and samplers extracted on the shaker were not included in the overall mean because it would bias the results. The test of wet samplers was performed to determine if the amount of water that would collect under high humidity conditions at the recommended air volume would affect the extraction efficiency. Wet samplers were prepared by sampling humid air having an average relative humidity of about 80% at 23 °C for 180 minutes at 0. 05 Umin and then liquid-spiking the sampler with the analyte. The dried silica gel tube (600 mg) collects 140 mg water at 78% RH and 23 °C when sampled for 9 L.\n\n【186】 #Stability of extracted samples\nThe stability of extracted samples was investigated by reanalyzing the target concentration samples 24 h after initial analysis. After the original analysis was performed, two autosampler vials were recapped with new septa while the remaining two retained their punctured septa. The samples were reanalyzed with fresh standards. The average percent change was +O. 7% for acetoin and +1.6% for diacetyl when samples were resealed with new septa and -1.1% for acetoin and +0.3% for diacetyl when samples retained their punctured septa. Each septum was punctured 5 times for each analysis. The test was performed at room temperature.\n\n【187】 #of 34 T-1012-FV-01-0811-M\natmosphere containing twice the target concentration at an average humidity of 78% at 23 °C was sampled for 180 min at 0. 05 Umin, and the samples were extracted that day. An additional three sampling trains were collected at the same time, and were protected from the light by aluminum foil. After collection, these samplers had the foil removed and were placed on the counter at ambient temperature under room light. These samples were analyzed 24 h after sampling during which they were exposed to the room light for 14 of the 24 h, and the recoveries were 80. 7%, 84. 7%, and 78.5% for acetoin and 79.3%, 82.4%, and 78.4% for diacetyl.\n\n【188】 #Powder form\nThe powder form of acetoin and diacetyl tested consisted of starch coated with acetoin and diacetyl. Three tests were performed on this powder. The first consisted of a sampling train of a pre-weighed (tared) PVC filter in a conical cassette in series with two dried silica gel tubes.\nTwo dried silica gel tubes were used to collect any vapors of acetoin and diacetyl which would be stripped off of the powder. Known amounts of the powder were placed onto the PVC filter, and 9 L of air at an average relative humidity of 78% RH and 22 °C were pulled through the sampling trains at 0. 05 Umin. The recovery of acetoin and diacetyl on the pre-weighed PVC filters was 0% to 1.9% for acetoin and 0% to 2.3% for diacetyl, with larger amounts found on the PVC filters that were spiked with larger amounts of powder. Most of the acetoin and diacetyl was stripped from the starch and collected on the dried silica gel tubes. The average recovery found on the dried silica gel tubes was 96. 6% for acetoin and 97. 8% for diacetyl . The acetoin and diacetyl theoretical weights were calculated from the percentages obtained from analysis of the powder and the amounts of the powder weighed out.\nAt 20% RH most of the acetoin and diacetyl were found on the front glass wool and glass fiber filter, but at 78% RH most of the acetoin and diacetyl were found on the dried silica gel beds. The sampling trains with 78% RH air drawn through them had the highest amounts of acetoin and diacetyl on the glass wool and filter on the tube spiked with the highest amount of powder, which may be due to the size of the clump of powder weighed out .\n\n【189】 #31of\nT-1012-FV-01-0811-M\n\n【190】 #. General Discussion\n\n【191】 Exposure to acetoin may result in skin, eyes, nose and throat irritation. Exposure to diacetyl \"liquid or vapors can cause irritation to the skin, eyes, nose, and throat\". \"Animals exposed to diacetyl experienced damage to the nose and upper airways, including severe damage to cells lining the respiratory tract\" and \"NIOSH has reported that employees exposed to butter flavorings containing diacetyl are at risk of developing occupational lung diseases\".\nDiacetyl, and to some extent acetoin, may be responsible for the occurrence of a rare and potentially fatal lung disease, bronchiolitis obliterans, among workers in microwave popcorn manufacturing plants and flavor manufacturing plants.Symptoms of bronchiolitis obliterans include cough, shortness of breath with exertion, and spirometry test results showing fixed airways obstruction.\n\n【192】 #Workplace exposure\nAcetoin has a somewhat creamy taste and a woody yogurt odor. It is used as an ingredient in yogurt, butter, milk and strawberry flavors. It occurs naturally in foods such as wines, chesses, fruits and vegetables.\n14 Occupational exposures can occur by inhalation or skin contact in locations where it is produced, used as a food additive, or used to produce flavorings or aromas.\nDiacetyl has a strong butter odor in dilute form and a chlorine-quinone odor when concentrated. It is used as an ingredient to produce a butter flavor in many foods and beverages. It occurs naturally in alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages, dairy products, fruits, plants, vegetables, meats, and natural aromas.Like acetoin, occupational exposures to diacetyl can occur by inhalation or skin contact in locations where it is produced, used as a food additive, or used to produce flavorings or aromas.\nRecently, occupational exposure to butter flavorings in the production of microwave popcorn and in other industries has received much publicity. NIOSH has identified acetoin and diacetyl as useful indicator compounds that can be used to represent exposure to butter flavorings.\nAreas of special concern include flavor production rooms, areas where mixing/blending operations occur, packing/packaging operations, areas where flavors are handled openly, rooms where mixing tanks are located, quality control laboratories, and maintenance and cleaning operations.\n\n【193】 #Reproducibility\nSix samples collected from a controlled test atmosphere were submitted for analysis by the OSHA Salt Lake Technical Center. The samples were analyzed according to a draft copy of this procedure after 20 days of storage at refrigerated temperature.\n\n【194】 #Sampling Procedure\nAll safety practices that apply to the work area being sampled should be followed. The sampling equipment should be attached to the worker in such a manner that it will not interfere with work performance or safety.\n\n【195】 #Apparatus\nSampler: glass tube with both ends flame sealed, 110-mm x 7-mm i.d.\nSamples are collected using a personal sampling pump calibrated, with the sampling device attached, to within ±5% of the recommended flow rate.\nUse aluminum foil or a tube cover, such as SKC, Inc Tube Cover D (cat. no. 224-290), to protect samples from light.\n\n【196】 #Reagents\nNone required\n\n【197】 #Technique\nImmediately before sampling, break the ends off of two flame-sealed glass tubes to provide an opening approximately half the internal diameter of the tube. Wear eye protection when breaking ends. Use a tube holder to minimize the hazard of broken glass and to protect samplers from light exposure during sampling. All tubes should be from the same lot.\nConnect the two silica gel sampling tubes in series, using the least amount of flexible tubing as possible between the sampling tubes, and then connect to a sampling pump with flexible tubing. The filter in the silica gel tubes should be positioned away from the sampling pump. The tube closer to the pump is used as a backup. Use a tube cover or wrap sampling tubes in aluminum foil to insure that both sampling tubes are protected from light exposure. Place the sampling tubes in a vertical position with the inlet in the breathing zone and position the sampling pump and tubing so they do not impede work performance or safety.\nDraw air directly into the inlet of the sampler. The air being sampled should not pass through any hose or tubing before entering the sampler.\nAfter sampling for the appropriate time, disconnect the tubes from the pump tubing and seal each tube with plastic end caps. Separately wrap each tube in aluminum foil and seal end-to end with a Form OSHA\nSubmit at least one blank sample with each set of samples. Handle the blank sample in the same manner as the other samples except draw no air through it.\nRecord sample air volume (L), sampling time (min) and sampling rate (L/min) for each sample, along with any potential interferences on the Form OSHA-91A.\nSampler capacity\nThe sampling capacity of the front tube was tested by sampling a dynamically generated test atmosphere of acetoin ( 3.58 mg/m 3 or 0.99 ppm) and diacetyl (3.55 mg/m 3 or 1.01 ppm) with an average relative humidity of 40% at 34 °C (absolute humidity of 14.8 mg/L H 2 0). The samples were collected at a sampling rate of approximately 0.05 L/min for 270 min. The 5% breakthrough sampling time was determined to be 248 min for diacetyl. No breakthrough was observed for acetoin.\nExtraction efficiency\nIt is the responsibility of each analytical laboratory to determine the extraction efficiency because the adsorbent material, reagents and laboratory techniques may be different than those listed in this evaluation and influence the results.\nThe mean extraction efficiency for acetoin from dry silica gel over the range of RQL to 2 times the target concentration (0.33 to 31.0 µg per sample) was 92.9%. The extraction efficiency was not affected by the presence of water.\nExtracted samples remain stable for at least 72 hr.\nSample for up to 15 min at 0.2 L/min (3 L) to collect short-term samples.\nWhen short-term samples are collected, the air concentration equivalent to the reliable quantitation limit becomes larger. For example, the reliable quantitation limit is 0.032 ppm (0.12 mg/m 3 ) for acetoin and 0.035 ppm (0.12 mg/m 3 ) for diacetyl when 3 Lare collected.\nInterferences, sampling\n\n【198】 #Retention efficiency\nThe retention efficiency for all samples was 100.6% of theoretical for acetoin and 96.6% for diacetyl, when samplers containing approximately 8.3 µg of acetoin and 8.1 µg of diacetyl were allowed to sample 6.75 L of contaminant-free air having an average relative humidity of 40% at 35 °C (absolute humidity of 15.6 mg/L H 2 0). Samples were collected at a sampling rate of 0.05 L/min.\n\n【199】 #Low humidity\nThe collection efficiency for all samples was 100.7% of theoretical for acetoin and 101.5% for diacetyl, when the samplers were used to sample a test atmosphere containing two times the target concentration having an average relative humidity of 8% at 33 °C (absolute humidity of 2.82 mg/L H 2 0). Samples were collected at a sampling rate of 0.05 Umin for 180 min.\n\n【200】 #Low concentration\nThe collection efficiency for all samples was 91.8% of theoretical for acetoin and 95.6% for diacetyl, when the samplers were used to sample a test atmosphere containing approximately 0.1 times the target concentration having an average relative humidity of 42% at 33 °C (absolute humidity of 14.8 mg/L H 2 0). Samples were collected at a sampling rate of 0.05 Umin for 180 min.\n\n【201】 #Sampling interference\nThe collection efficiency for all samples was 95.5% of theoretical for acetoin and 101.8% for diacetyl, when the sampler was used to sample a test atmosphere containing approximately one times the target concentration of acetoin and diacetyl and 2.59 mg/m 3 of 2-nonanone and 1.88 mg/m 3 of 2,3-pentanedione. The test atmosphere had an average relative humidity of 38% at 34 °C (absolute humidity of 14.1 mg/L H 2 0). Samples were collected at a sampling rate of 0.05 Umin for 181 min.\nSampler exposure to light, particularly sunlight, during sampling will result in degradation of both acetoin and diacetyl. The recovery for all samples was 67 .0% of theoretical for acetoin and 6.43% for diacetyl, when the sampler was used to sample a test atmosphere containing approximately one times the target concentration of acetoin and diacetyl and then exposed to 3 h of direct sunlight (samples were covered during sampling). The test atmosphere had an average relative humidity of 40% at 35 °C (absolute humidity of 15.6 mg/L H 2 0). Samples were collected at a sampling rate of 0.05 Umin for 180 min.\n\n【202】 #Analytical Procedure\nAdhere to the rules set down in your Chemical Hygiene Plan\nAvoid skin contact and inhalation of all chemicals and review all appropriate MSDSs.\n\n【203】 #Apparatus\nA gas chromatograph equipped with an FID. For this evaluation an Agilent Technologies 6890 Plus Gas Chromatograph equipped with a 7683 Automatic Sampler and an Agilent tapered, deactivated, split, low pressure drop liner with glass wool (catalog no. 5183-4647).\nA GC column capable of separating acetoin and diacetyl from the desorption solvent, internal standard and any potential interferences. A Restek 60-m x 0.32-mm i.d. Rix-Volatiles (1.5-µm df) capillary column was used in this evaluation.\nBracket sample concentrations with standard concentrations.\nIf upon analysis, sample concentrations fall outside the range of prepared standards, prepare and analyze additional standards to confirm instrument response, or dilute high samples with extraction solvent and reanalyze the diluted samples.\n\n【204】 #Sample preparation\nRemove the plastic end caps from the front sample tube and carefully transfer the silica gel to a 4-ml amber glass vial. The sampling tube and the back of the glass fiber filter should be carefully inspected to insure that all the silica gel is transferred into the 4-ml vial. Remove the plastic end caps from the backup tube and carefully transfer the silica gel to a second 4-ml amber glass vial. If the industrial hygienist requests analysis of the front glass fiber filter, which is not normally analyzed, place the front glass wool plug and filter from the front tube into a third 4-ml vial. If analysis of filter is not requested then discard the front glass wool plug and filter. Discard the glass tubes and back glass wool plugs and back glass fiber filter.\nAdd 2.0 ml of extraction solution to each vial and immediately seal with PTFE-lined caps.\n\n【205】 Place the 4-ml vials on a mechanical rotator and rotate at approximately 40 rpm for 60 min.\nTransfer the extraction solution in each 4-ml vial to a 2-ml amber glass autosampler vial and seal with a PTFE-lined cap.\n\n【206】 #Calibration\nAn internal standard calibration method is used. A calibration curve can be constructed by plotting !STD-corrected response of standard injections versus micrograms of analyte per sample. Bracket the samples with freshly prepared analytical standards over the range of concentrations. The Guidelines define analytical parameters, specify required laboratory tests, statistical calculations and acceptance criteria.\nDetection limit of the analytical procedure (DLAP)\nThe DLAP is measured as mass of analyte introduced onto the chromatographic column. Ten analytical standards were prepared with equally descending increments with the highest standard containing 1.1 O µg/sample acetoin and 1 .05 µg/sample diacetyl. This is the concentration that would produce a peak approximately 10 times the response of a calibration blank. These standards, and the calibration blank were analyzed with the recommended analytical parameters (1-µL injection with a 2:1 spit), and the data obtained were used to determine the required parameters (standard error of estimate and slope) for the calculation of the DLAP. For acetoin values of 5171 and 30 were obtained for the slope and standard error of estimate respectively. The DLAP for acetoin was calculated to be 0.017 ng acetoin. For diacetyl values of 4325 and 47 were obtained for the slope and standard error of estimate respectively. The DLAP for diacetyl was calculated to be 0.033 ng diacetyl.  Detection limit of the overall procedure (DLOP) and reliable quantitation limit (RQL)\nThe standard error of estimate was determined from the linear regression of data points from standards over a range that covers approximately 0.25 to 2 times the target concentration.\n\n【207】 #Reproducibility\nSix samples were prepared by collecting them from a controlled test atmosphere similar to that which was used in the collection of the storage samples. The samples were submitted to the OSHA Salt Lake Technical Center for analysis along with a draft copy of this method. The samples were analyzed after being stored for 20 days at refrigerated temperature (about 3 °C). Sample results were corrected for extraction efficiency.\nThe sampling capacity of the front tube was tested by sampling from a dynamically generated test atmosphere at 2 times the target concentration of acetoin (3.58 mg/m 3 or 0.99 ppm) and diacetyl (3.55 mg/m 3 or 1.01 ppm) with an average relative humidity of 40% at 34 °C (absolute humidity of 14.8 mg/L H 2 0). The samples were collected at a sampling rate of 0.05 L/min. Backup tubes were placed in-line behind the front tube and were changed regularly after the initial collection of 225 min. Breakthrough for diacetyl was observed after sampling 12.4 L. No breakthrough was observed for acetoin even after sampling for 265 min. The recommended sampling time is 3 h. The extraction efficiency is dependent on the extraction solvent as well as the internal standard.\nOther extraction solvents or internal standards may be used provided that the new extraction solution or internal standard is tested. The new extraction solvent or internal standard should be tested as described below.\n\n【208】 #Extraction efficiency\nThe extraction efficiency of acetion and diacetyl was determined by liquid spiking four samplers, at each concentration level, with the analytes from the RQL to 2 times the target concentrations. These samples were stored overnight at ambient temperature and then analyzed. The mean extraction efficiency over the working range of the RQL to 2 times the target concentration is 92.9% for acetoin. The extraction efficiency for the wet samplers was not included in the overall mean because it would bias the results. The mean extraction efficiency over the working range of the RQL to 2 times the target concentration is 99.6% for diacetyl. The extraction efficiency for the wet samplers was not included in the overall mean because it would bias the results.\n\n【209】 #Stability of extracted samples\nThe stability of extracted samples was investigated by reanalyzing the target concentration samples 24 h and 72 h after initial analysis. After each analysis was performed, two vials were recapped with new septa while the remaining two retained their punctured septa. The samples were reanalyzed with fresh standards. Samples were stored at ambient temperature and each septum was punctured 4 times for each analysis.\n\n【210】 #Low humidity\nThe ability of the sampler to collect acetoin and diacetyl from a relatively dry atmosphere was tested by sampling from a dynamically generated test atmosphere of acetoin ( 4.06 mg/m 3 or 1.13 ppm) and diacetyl (4.03 mg/m 3 or 1 .14 ppm) with an average relative humidity of 8% at 33 °C (absolute humidity of 2.82 mg/L H 2 0). Three samplers had contaminated air drawn through them at 0.05 L/min for 180 min. All of the samples were immediately analyzed. The samplers collected 103.0%, 96.9% and 102.2% of theoretical for acetoin and 96.7%, 106.6% and 101.2% of theoretical for diacetyl.\n\n【211】 #Low concentration\nThe ability of the sampler to collect acetoin and diacetyl at low concentrations was tested by sampling from a dynamically generated test atmosphere of 0.1 times the target concentration of acetion (0.185 mg/m 3 or 0.0515 ppm) and diacetyl (0.175 mg/m 3 or 0.0497 ppm) with an average relative humidity of 42% at 33 °C (absolute humidity of 14.8 mg/L H 2 0). Three samplers had contaminated air drawn through them at 0.05 L/min for 180 min. All of the samples were immediately analyzed. The samplers collected 93.9%, 91.5% and 89.9% of theoretical for acetoin and 92.8%, 97.4% and 96. 7% of theoretical for diacetyl.\n\n【212】 #Interferences\nThe ability of the sampler to collect acetoin and diacetyl was tested when other potential interferences are present by sampling an atmosphere containing 1.63 mg/m 3 (0.45 ppm) of acetoin, 1.56 mg/m 3 (0.44 ppm) of diacetyl, 2.59 mg/m 3 (0.44 ppm) of 2-nonanone and 1.88 mg/m 3 (0.44 ppm) of 2,3-pentanedione with an average relative humidity of 38% at 34 °C (absolute humidity of 14.1 mg/L H 2 0). Three samplers had contaminated air drawn through them at 0.05 L/min for 181 min. All of the samples were immediately analyzed. The samplers collected 93.2%, 96.5% and 96.8% of theoretical for acetoin and 100.6%, 100.6% and 104.1% of theoretical for diacetyl. Selection of 2-nonanone as a potential interference was based on its common use in butter flavorings used in microwave popcorn manufacturing facilities 29 . 2,3-Pentanedione was selected because it has been suggested as a possible replacement for diacetyl. (Note: The GC retention time of 2-nonanone was 14.4 min and 7.4 min for 2,3pentanedione. For this test the GC column temperature program was slightly changed to Initial 60 °C, hold 4 min; ramp at 15 °C/min to 225 °C, hold 0 min; ramp at 60 °C/min to 250 °C, hold 4 min to allow for the elution of 2-nonanone.)\n\n【213】 #Light\n\n【214】 To test the possibility of light degradation on extracted samples nine analytical standards at the target concentration were prepared. Six of the standards were placed in 2-ml amber glass vials and three were placed in 2-ml clear glass vials. Three of the amber vials, along with the clear glass vials were stored on the autosampler tray during the entire test while the other three amber vials were stored in the refrigerator when not being analyzed. All nine standards were analyzed eight times over a 10 day period with none of the septa being replaced during the test. With the exception of diacetyl in clear vials, acetoin and diacetyl did not degrade. This data clearly indicates that extracted samples should be protected from exposure to light. This data also indicates that acetoin and diacetyl are stable in the extraction solution for up to 9 days as long as they are stored in amber vials. The internal standard, 3-pentanone, was stable for up to 9 days in both the clear and ambient vials.\n\n【215】 #Diacetyl migration within sampling tubes\nIn the majority of solid sorbent sampling tubes used by  (3.17 mg/m 3 or 0.90 ppm) with an average relative humidity of 42% at 33 °C (absolute humidity of 14.8 mg/L H 2 0). The samples were collected at a sampling rate of 0.05 L/min for 3 hours. Three samples were analyzed on the day of generation and the other twelve were stored in a closed drawer at ambient temperature (about 21 °C). At 3-4 day intervals, three additional samples were analyzed. After 14 days up to\n\n【216】 House air was dried and then humidified and regulated using a Miller Nelson Model 401 Flow Temperature-Humidity Control System. A measured flow (typically 10 µL per min) of an acetoin and diacetyl water solution was pumped through a 0.53-mm uncoated fused silica capillary tube into the inlet manifold, using a Series D ISCO Syringe Pump with Controller, and mixed with dilution air (typically 100 liters per min) coming from the Miller Nelson Control System. The inlet manifold was heated by wrapping it in heat tape, regulated with a variable autotransformer, in order to insure vaporization of acetoin. The acetoin and diacetyl gas mixture then flowed continuously into the mixing chamber (76-cm x 15-cm) and then into the sampling chamber (56-cm x 9.5-cm). Samples were collected through sampling ports on the sampling chamber. Temperature and humidity were measured near the exit of the sampling chamber using an Omega Digital Thermo hygrometer model RH411. When necessary, the identity or purity of an analyte peak can be confirmed by GC-mass spectrometry or by another analytical procedure.\n\n【217】 #General Discussion\nThese procedures were designed and tested for internal use by OSHA personnel. Mention of any company name or commercial product does not constitute endorsement by OSHA.\n1.1 Background\n\n【218】 #History\nOSHA is concerned about workplace exposure to 2,3-pentanedione because it is a butter flavoring agent that is sometimes substituted for diacetyl. 1 2,3-Pentanedione is chemically similar to diacetyl and may have similar toxicological properties.\n2 This work was performed because OSHA has no sampling and analytical method for 2,3pentanedione and none was found in a literature review.\nOne of the main objectives of this work was to enable OSHA CSHOs to monitor workplace exposure to diacetyl, acetoin and 2,3-pentanedione simultaneously on the same sample. Because of the similarities of the chemicals, it was decided to validate existing sampling and analytical methodology specified in OSHA Method 10\n3 for 2,3pentanedione. That method requires sampling with two commercially available silica gel tubes connected in series. This method specifies a different GC column than specified in Method 1013 in order to optimize the analytical separation. The reliable quatitation limits for acetoin and diacetyl cited in OSHA Method 1013 were confirmed with the GC column used in this validation.\n\n【219】 1.1.3 Workplace exposure 2,3-Pentanedione is a natural flavorant and odorant that is also synthesized for use in odor and flavor manufacturing.It is used to give products a buttery, nutty, cheesy, fruity, toasted, chocolate, or caramste. It also gives products a buttery, fruity, and caramel odor. There can be as much as 58 ppm in food flavorings, and up to 0.08% in fragrances.\n2,3-Pentanedione is used as a solvent for cellulose acetate, paints, inks, lacquers, as a starting material for dyes, pesticides and pharmaceuticals, and as a photoinitializer for photo-reactive dyes.\n\n【220】 #Sampling Procedure\nAll safety practices that apply to the work area being sampled should be followed. The sampling equipment should be attached to the worker in such a manner that it will not interfere with work performance or safety.\n\n【221】 #Apparatus\nSamples are collected with 110-cm x 7-mm o.d.\nUse an opaque tube holder, such as SKC,  to cover the sampling train during sampling. If the tube holder is not opaque, wrap the sampler with aluminum foil. Light can decompose collected 2,3-pentanedione.\nSamples are collected using a personal sampling pump calibrated to within ±5% of the recommended flow rate with the sampling device in-line.\n\n【222】 #Reagents\nNone required\n\n【223】 #Technique\nImmediately before sampling, break off both ends of the flame-sealed tube to provide an opening approximately half the internal diameter of the tube. Wear eye protection when breaking ends. Use sampling tube holders to minimize the hazard to the worker from the broken ends of the tubes and to minimize the potential of glass shards entering the foodstuffs. All tubes should be from the same lot.\nA sampling train is prepared by attaching a Part A tube in front of and in series with a Part B tube, with both glass fiber filters facing forward.\nThe Part B tube in the sampling train is used as a back-up and is positioned nearest the sampling pump. Attach the tube holder (with the adsorbent tube sampling train) to the sampling pump so that the sampling train is in an approximately vertical position with the inlet facing down in the worker's breathing zone during sampling. Position the sampling pump, tube holder and tubing so they do not impede work performance or safety.\nDraw the air to be sampled directly into the inlet of the tube holder. The air being sampled is not to be passed through any hose or tubing before entering the sampling tube.\nSample for up to 200 min at 50 ml/min (10 L) to collect TWA (long-term) samples. If acetoin and/or diacetyl are anticipated to be present, sample for up to 180 min at 50 ml/min (9 L) to collect TWA (long-term) samples. The extraction solvent used for this validation consisted of 0.007 µL/ml 3-pentanone in 95% v/v ethyl alcohol/water. The 3-pentanone was added to the ethyl alcohol as an internal standard (ISTD).\n\n【224】 #Standard preparation\n(Note: Store all standards in amber glass bottles and vials)\nPrepare concentrated stock standards in water at 1.021 mg/ml (1 .021 µg/µl) by injecting 11 µl of neat 2,3-pentanedione into water in a 10-ml volumetric flask and diluting to the mark. This stock standard will remain stable for two weeks if stored in an amber bottle in the refrigerator. When using refrigerated stock standards, be sure to allow the standards to warm to room temperature and then shake them vigorously before use. Prepare analytical standards by injecting microliter amounts of concentrated stock standards into 2-ml volumetric flasks containing about 1.75 ml of extraction solvent and then diluting with extraction solvent over a concentration range of 0.1 to 20 µg/ml (0.2 to 40 µg/2 ml). For example: a target concentration standard of 20.4 µg/sample was prepared by injecting 20 µl of the stock standard into a 2-ml flask containing about 1.75 ml of extraction solvent and then diluting to the mark with extraction solvent (10.2 µg/ml or 0.5 ppm based on a 2-ml extraction volume per sample and 10 lair volumes).\nBracket sample concentrations with standard concentrations.\nIf upon analysis, sample concentrations fall outside the range of prepared standards, prepare and analyze additional standards to confirm instrument response, or dilute high samples with extraction solvent and reanalyze the diluted samples.\n\n【225】 #Sample preparation\n(Note: prepare all samples in amber glass vials)\nRemove the plastic end caps from the front sample tube and carefully transfer the silica gel to a labeled 4-ml amber glass vial. The sampling tube and the back of the glass fiber filter should be carefully inspected to ensure that all the silica gel is transferred into the 4-ml vial. Remove the plastic end caps from the backup tube and carefully transfer the silica gel to a second labeled 4-ml amber glass vial. If the industrial hygienist requests analysis of the front glass fiber filter, which is not normally analyzed, place the front glass wool plug and filter from the front tube into a third 4-ml vial. If analysis of filter is not requested then discard the front glass wool plug and filter. Discard the glass tubes and back glass wool plugs and back glass fiber filter.\nAdd 2.0 ml of extraction solvent to each vial and immediately seal the vials with PTFE-lined caps.\nImmediately place the vials on a rotator for 60 min. Transfer the sample into autosampler vials for analysis. (Key: 1) ethyl alcohol; 2 2,3pentanedione; and 3 3-pentanone. 3.6 Interferences (analytical)\n3.6.1 Any compound that produces a GC response and has a similar retention time as the analyte or internal standard is a potential interference. If potential interferences were reported, they should be considered before samples are extracted. Generally, chromatographic conditions can be altered to separate interferences from the analyte.\n3.6.2 When necessary, the identity of an analyte peak can be confirmed with additional analytical data or procedures .\n\n【226】 #Calculations\nThe amount of analyte per sample is obtained from the appropriate calibration curve in terms of micrograms per sample, uncorrected for extraction efficiency. The second tube is analyzed primarily to determine the extent of sampler saturation. If any analyte is found on the back tube, it is added to the amount on the front tube. If more than 20% of the total amount is found on the back tube, report that the sampler may have been saturated on the Form OSHA-91 B. This total amount is then corrected by subtracting the total amount (if any) found on the blank. The air concentration is calculated using the following formulas.\nDetection limit of the analytical procedure (DLAP)\nWhen short-term samples are collected, the air concentration equivalent to the reliable quantitation limit becomes larger. For example, the reliable quantitation limit for the recommended sampler is 31 ppb (127 µg/m 3 ) when 3 Lis sampled.\n\n【227】 #Precision of the analytical method\nThe precision of the analytical method was measured as the mass equivalent to the standard error of estimate determined from the linear regression of data points from standards over a range that covers 0.1 to 2 times the TWA target concentration for the sampler.\n\n【228】 #Precision (overall procedure)\nThe precision of the overall procedure at the 95% confidence level is obtained by multiplying the standard error of estimate by 1.96 (the z-statistic from the standard normal distribution at the 95% confidence level).\nTwo dried silica gel tubes in series  The precision at the 95% confidence for the refrigerated temperature (4 °C) 17-day storage test was± 10.1 %. It contains an additional 5% for sampling pump error.\n\n【229】 #Recovery\nThe recovery of 2,3-pentanedione from samples used in a 17-day storage test remained above 91 .3% when samples were stored at 4 °C.\n\n【230】 #Reproducibility\nSix samples were prepared by sampling a dynamically generated controlled test atmosphere similar to that used in the collection of the storage samples. The concentrations of 2,3pentanedione in the test atmosphere was 0.501 ppm (2.05 mg/m 3 ) at 78% relative humidity and 23 °C. The samples were submitted to the OSHA Salt Lake Technical Center for analysis. The samples were analyzed after being stored at 4 °C for 4 days. Sample results were corrected for extraction efficiency.\n12of\n\n【231】 #Extraction efficiency and stability of extracted samples\nThe extraction efficiency is affected by the extraction solvent, the internal standard, the sampling medium, and the technique used to extract the samples. Other reagents and techniques than described in this method can be used provided they are tested as specified in the guidelines.\n\n【232】 #Extraction efficiency\nThe extraction efficiency of 2,3-pentanedione was determined by liquid-spiking four front sampling tubes of the recommended air sampler at each concentration level. These samples were stored overnight at ambient temperature and then analyzed. The overall mean extraction efficiency over the working range of 0.1 to 2 times the target concentration was 97.6%. The presence of water had no significant effect on extraction efficiency. The extraction efficiencies for the RQL and for the wet samplers are not included in the overall mean. Wet media were prepared by sampling humid air (78% RH at 23 °C) for 200 min at 50 ml/min.\nsampled at 50 ml/min for 150 min and then all six samplers were analyzed.\n3  of 2,3pentanedione at 20% relative humidity and 23 °C. The test atmosphere was sampled with three of the recommended samplers at 50 ml/min for 200 min. All of the samples were immediately analyzed. Sample results were 98.8%, 99.1%, and 97.4% of theoretical.\n\n【233】 #Low concentration\nThe effect of low concentration was tested by sampling a dynamically generated controlled test atmosphere containing 0.1 times the target concentration (0.05 ppm or 0.205 mg/m 3 ) of 2,3pentanedione at 80% relative humidity and 23 °C. The test atmosphere was sampled with three of the recommended samplers at 0.05 ml/min for 200 min. All of the samples were immediately analyzed. Sample results were 98.7%, 97.0%, and 95.8% of theoretical.\n\n【234】 #Chemical interference\nThe ability of the recommended sampler to collect 2,3-pentanedione was tested when other potential interferences are present by sampling an atmosphere containing 0.5 ppm (2.05 mg/m 3 ) 2,3-pentanedione at 80% relative humidity and 23 °C and two interferences whose concentrations were 0.51 ppm (1.82 mg/m 3 ) acetoin, and 0.51 ppm (1.78 mg/m 3 ) diacetyl. The test atmosphere was sampled with three of the recommended samplers at 50 ml/min for 200 min. All of the samples were immediately analyzed. Sample results for 2,3-pentanedione were 97.1 %, 96.3%, and 95.5% of theoretical. 2,3pentanedione at an average humidity of 80% at 23°C was sampled for 200 minutes at 50 ml/min. The three foil-wrapped and three unwrapped samples were analyzed immediately and the average recovery for the foil wrapped was 98.2% and the un-wrapped sampler average recovery was 96.6%. Three of the foil-wrapped samplers had the foil removed after sampling and were exposed to fluorescent room lights for 24 h before analysis and had an average recovery of 90.3%. The last three foil wrapped samplers had the foil removed and were exposed to 3 h of sunlight before analysis 15of17 and had an average recovery of 42.4%. This data clearly indicates that the sampler should be protected from exposure to light.\nTo test the possibility of light degradation on extracted samples nine analytical standards at the target concentration were prepared. Six of the standards were placed in 2-ml amber glass vials and three were placed in 2-ml clear glass vials. Three of the amber vials, along with the clear glass vials were stored on the autosampler tray during the entire test while the other three amber vials were stored in the refrigerator when not being analyzed. All nine standards were analyzed eight times over a 10 day period with none of the septa being replaced during the test. The standards in clear vials degraded significantly, but standards in amber vials did not degrade. This data clearly indicates that extracted samples should be protected from exposure to light. The internal standard, 3-pentanone was stable for up to 9 days in both the clear and ambient vials.\n\n【235】 #SAMPLING:\nNOTE: Prior to field use, clean all thermal desorption tubes thoroughly by heating at or above the intended tube desorption temperature for 1-2 hours with carrier gas flowing at a rate of at least 50 ml/min. Always store tubes with long-term storage caps attached, or in containers that prevent contamination. Identify each tube uniquely with a permanent number on either the tube or tube container. Under no circumstances should tape or labels be applied directly to the thermal desorption tubes. 1. Calibrate each personal sampling pump with a representative sampler in line. 2. Remove the caps of the sampler immediately before sampling. Attach sampler to personal sampling pump with flexible tubing. NOTE: With a multi-bed sorbent tube, it is extremely important to sample in the correct direction, from least to maximum strength sorbent. 3. For general screening, sample at 0.01 to 0.05 L/min for a maximum sample volume of 6 L. Replace caps immediately after sampling. Keep field blanks capped at all times. Tubes can act as diffusive samplers if left uncapped in a contaminated environment. 4. Collect a \"humidity test\" sample to determine if the thermal adsorption tubes have a high water background. NOTE: At higher sample volumes, additional analyte and water (from humidity) may be collected on the sampling tube. At sufficiently high levels of analyte or water in the sample, the mass spectrometer may malfunction during analysis resulting in loss of data for a given sample. 5. Collect a \"control\" sample. For indoor air samples this could be either an outside sample at the same location or an indoor sample taken in a non-complaint area. 6. Ship in sample storage containers at ambient temperature. Store at -10 °C.\n\n【236】 #SAMPLE PREPARATION:\n7. Allow samples to equilibrate to room temperature prior to analysis. Remove each sampler from is storage container. Preparation of spiked samples Spiked tubes can be prepared from either liquid or gas bulb standards.\nLiquid standards: Prepare stock solutions by adding known amounts of analytes to 10-ml volumetric flasks containing high purity solvent (carbon disulfide, methanol, toluene). Solvents are chosen based on solubility for the analytes of interest and ability to be separated from the analytes when chromatographed. Highly volatile compounds should be dissolved in a less volatile solvent. For most compounds, carbon disulfide is a good general purpose solvent, although this will interfere with early eluting compounds.\n\n【237】 #Gas bulb standards:\nInject known amounts of organic analytes of interest into a gas bulb of known volume filled with clean air . Prior to closing the bulb, place a magnetic stirrer and several glass beads are placed in the bulb to assist in agitation after introduction of the analytes. After injection of all of the analytes of interest into the bulb, warm the bulb to 50 °C and place it on a magnetic stirring plate and stir for several minutes to ensure complete vaporization of the analytes. After the bulb has been stirred and cooled to room temperature, remove aliquots from the bulb with a gas syringe and inject into a sample tube as described below.\nTube spiking Fit a GC injector with a%\" column adapter. Maintain the injector at 120 °C to assist in vaporization of the injected sample. Attach cleaned thermal desorption tubes to injector with%\" Swagelok nuts and Teflon ferrules, and adjust helium flow though the injector to 50 ml/min. Attach the sampling tube so that flow direction is the same as for sampling. Take an aliquot of standard solution (gas standards 100 to 500 µL; liquid standards, 0.1 to 2 µL) and inject into the GC injector. Allow to equilibrate for 10 minutes. Remove tube and analyze by thermal desorption using the same conditions as for field samples.\nlnstrumentation:Actual media, instrumentation, and conditions used for general screening of unknown environments are as follows: Perkin-Elmer ATD 400 (automated thermal desorption system) interfaced directly to a Hewlett-Packard 5980 gas chromatograph/HP5970 mass selective detector and data system.\n\n【238】 #INTRODUCTION\nD iacetyl ,2, a dike tone chemical used to impart a buttery taste in many flavoring mixtures, has been associated with severe respiratory disease in several different occupational settings, including microwave popcorn manufacturing, flavoring production, and diacetyl manufacturing_Cl-3 l Laboratory animal studies have documented that diacetyl alone has toxic properties that are similar to the effects of exposure to diacetyl-containing artifi cial butter flavoring mixtures.C 4 - 5 l The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is in the process ofrulemaking on occupational exposure to diacetyl.\nNational Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) researchers developed and published an analytical method, NIOSH Method 2557, to measure airborne diacetyl in the workplace.C 6 -7 l This method specifies air sample collection through carbon molecular sieve (CMS) sorbent tubes, followed by extraction with acetone/methanol (99: 1) and analysis by gas chromatography with flame ionization detection (GC/FID) within 7 days of sampling. Subsequent to the use of this sampling method in several workplace investigations, NIOSH researchers found that the method appeared to progressively 8 Nine each of the 0.5 and 25 ppm samples and 18 of the 5.0 ppm samples were used in both humidity and storage stability analyses.\n\n【239】 #Sampling Test Conditions\nSamples were collected between January 2008 and De cember 2009 during four 1-week periods and one 2-week period of tests. We collected a total of 964 CMS tube sam ples during 80 tests, with relative humidity (RH) levels rang ing from 16 to 92% and temperatures of 22.4 to 33.8°C giving absolute humidity (AH) levels ranging from 3.5 to 22.5 mg H 2 0/L air and with diacetyl concentrations ranging from 0.23 to 25.7 ppm. Samples were collected over 2, 4, or 8 hr to test for differences in diacetyl recovery due to sampling duration or because of limit of detection (LOD) concerns during tests at low diacetyl concentrations. Sam ples were collected using sampling flow rates of 50 or 150 cc/min to investigate any effect on diacetyl recovery associ ated with differences in sampling flow rate.\nOver the five visits, we collected 134 silica gel samples at a flow rate of 50 cc/min during 43 of the 2-hr tests. These samples were collected with an AH range of 3.57 to 22.50 mg H 2 0/L air and diacetyl concentrations from 0.56 to 25.7 ppm.\n\n【240】 #Sample Storage Stability Tests\nIn total, storage stability of diacetyl both in the sampling tubes (in-tube) and after extraction from the tubes was in vestigated using 214 samples . In the first set of experimental conditions, six sets of triplicate samples were collected at 50 cc/min from a 5.7 ppm diacetyl test atmosphere at each of three AH levels: 3.97, 8.59, and 18.67 mg H 2 0/L air (RH= 17, 36, and 78%, respectively, at 25.7°C). Samples were sent overnight on ice to the analytical laboratory, where they were extracted and analyzed according to NIOSH Method 2557 for diacetyl 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, and 16 days post-sampling. All samples were stored in a refrigerator until the scheduled day of extraction.\nAfter analysis of the first set of samples on Day 1 post sampling, the remaining liquid portion (without sorbent mate rial) of each sample was split into two new vials and one stored at room temperature and the other refrigerated. These samples underwent further stability testing via re-analysis 1, 2, 5, and 11 days post-extraction. New septum caps were placed on each vial after each analysis, and freshly prepared standards were used for each re-analysis. To investigate diacetyl concentration effect on storage stability, during the final week of tests, six sets of triplicate samples each were collected from 0.57, 5.6, and 25.0 ppm diacetyl test atmospheres at each of three mean AH levels: 3.6, 8.5, and 18.5 mg H 2 0/L air. The samples were extracted and analyzed 1,4,7,10,16, and 35 days post sampling. When splitting the samples for the extract storage stability tests, equal portions of the sorbent material were placed into the two vials with the liquid to better simulate treatment of field samples as directed in Method 2557. Re analysis of these samples was completed on Days 2, 5, 13, and 34 post-extraction.\n\n【241】 #RESULTS\n0 f 964 CMS samples collected, 717 were used in humidity effect analyses (extraction Day 1 after sampling), 214 were used in sample storage stability analyses (36 of these were used in both analyses), 42 samples from 1 day of tests were excluded due to excessive analytical laboratory variability (the mean coefficient of variation for that day's tests was 73% as compared with a range of 3% to 23% for other days), 13 were excluded due to greater than 5% changes in sampling flow rate during the tests, 3 were excluded due to errors during sampling, 1 had missing data from the analytical laboratory, 1 outlier (greater than 300% recovery) was excluded, and 9 samples collected at low concentration and high humidity were excluded because of nondetectable diacetyl.\nOf the 134 silica gel samples, 121 that had matching CMS sample groups during 39 tests were used in the comparison analyses.\n\n【242】 During the first week of tests, homogeneous mixing of di acetyl in the exposure chamber was investigated, and analysis of variance indicated no significant effects of sampling port position on diacetyl recovery. An analysis of variance model using data from the first three laboratory visits (n = 448) with percent diacetyl recovery as the outcome variable and AH, test atmosphere diacetyl concentration, target sampling flow rate, and sampling duration as the predictor variables indicated a significant  effect of sampling flow rate, with percent diacetyl recovery being higher for the 150 cc/min sampling flow rate than for 50 cc/min. The magnitude of the effect was not large; the adjusted means (least squares means) for 150 cc/min and 50 cc/min were 44.9 and 40.3% diacetyl recovery, respectively. In this model there was no significant effect for sampling duration , with adjusted means of 42. 3, 41.8, and 43. 7% diacetyl recovery for sampling durations of 2, 4, and 8 hr, respectively.\n\n【243】 #Absolute Humidity Effect-Model for Data from Samples Extracted on Day 1 After Sampling\nWe investigated the effect of temperature on diacetyl recov ery by plotting percent diacetyl recovered against either RH  in% or AH  in mg H 2 0/L air using data from samples collected from a target diacetyl concentration of 5 ppm at target temperatures of 25°C and 32°C. We calculated AH from RH and temperature (Tc) using Eq. 1, which we derived from a National Weather Service approximation for humidity calculations in surface observations.\n\n【244】 In our models, percent recovered diacetyl was the Y vari able, and humidity was the X variable.\nWe fitted separate 4-parameter logistic models to the data for each of the target test atmosphere diacetyl concentrations (0.2, 0.5, 5.0, and 20 ppm). We had too few levels of AH for the 1.0 ppm test atmosphere diacetyl concentration to adequately fit the 4-parameter logistic model.\nUsing information from these models, we created one non linear model for the data overall; this model took into ac count differences in the 4-parameter values for the individual logistic models. We found that 8 1 was well approximated (R 2 = 0.99) by a linear function of target concentration Co We entered this form of the equation (Eq. 3) into the nonlin ear fitting platform for a fit through all the data (including the data for a test atmosphere diacetyl concentration of 1.0 ppm). We repeated the fit through the data stratified by sampling flow rate.\n\n【245】 #OSHA Silica Gel Sample Results\nDiacetyl concentrations from the 121 silica gel samples taken at a number of AH conditions were quite similar to the calculated test atmosphere concentrations  and were not affected by AH. Using the model ,Eq.\n\n【246】 #Model for Effect of In-Tube Storage\n\n【247】 To model in-tube storage effects, we used first-order decay functions to estimate decay constants for the 12 combinations of diacetyl concentrations and AH. We normalized the diacetyl recovery data by dividing the diacetyl recovery data by the mean for recovery on Day 1 after sampling and included (t-1) in the first-order decay functions . The first-order decay model is given by: Y =(starting amount) exp , where starting amount = 1 for normalized data, t = days from sampling to extraction, and k is the decay constant.\nWe substituted functions of AH and diacetyl concentration for the decay constants (k). This was accomplished in two steps. In Step 1, we fitted quadratic functions to the k values for the three target diacetyl concentration (0.5 ppm, 5 ppm, and 25 ppm) curves of k vs. AH. In Step 2, we substituted three parameter first-order decay functions for the coefficients for the intercept, the AH term and the AH 2 term of the quadratic function based on the diacetyl concentrations. This gave esti mates for the nine coefficients (q, r, s, u, v, w, x, y, and z) in the model (as shown below). In a final step, the values of the nine parameters were used as starting values to get a fit of this nonlinear model through the full set of in-tube storage data. The R 2 for this model was\nFull Model + h(Co)AH + f3(Co)AH 2 (t -l)\n\n【248】 aC6 + bCo -( c ) = 0  g,Co,\nCo= _ _ _ _ _ _ 2_a _ _ _ _ _ -b+  (Note: The other solution for Eq. 6 using the quadratic formula yields a nonphysical negative value for Co since a > 0 and b > 0.) c In Eqs. 6 and 7 the value of  is the estimate g(Co, AH, t) for the diacetyl concentration corrected for days to extraction after sampling.\nTo solve Eq. 7, an iterative procedure is used with the i value cgl used to calculate the Ci+ 1 value cg+ 1 l b2 + 4a , 0 c\n\n【249】 It is necessary to start the procedure with an initial Co ,i.e. c6 1 \\ We found the procedure robust to the choice of starting value and suggest the use of c (the recovered concentration reported by the laboratory).\nThe sequence of solutions is then calculated until two consecutive values for Co are identical to a chosen number of decimal places (convergence). We tested the model for regions of convergence using theoretical recovered concentrations ( c) from 0.001to70 ppm, AH from 2 to 25 mg H 2 0/L air, and days to extraction from 1 to 36. We found that convergence occurred for all concentrations above 1.0 ppm. For lower concentrations, convergence occurred whenever AH was less than 14.5 mg H 2 0/L air and days to extraction were fewer than 9. The region of convergence improved from a concentration of0.001 to 1.0 ppm. At 1.0 ppm, convergence occurred whenever AH was less than 21 mg H 2 0 IL air and days to extraction were fewer than\nAs discussed above, for values of Co > 56 ppm, the Day 1 model does not yield real-life solutions. For these values, only the model for effect of days to extraction should be applied and we predict the concentration of diacetyl for Day 1 of extraction after sampling. If the converged value as calculated above is> 56 ppm, use it as the starting value c6 1 l in an iterative procedure using the equation:\ncCi+l - c 0 - (Cl ) g C 0 ', AH, t\nA strength of this work was the use of a controlled test atmosphere to simulate historical field survey conditions where airborne diacetyl was sampled together with humid air. By using two target temperatures with similar ranges of RH, we were able to show that both temperature and RH had an effect on diacetyl recovery and that using AH (mg H 2 0/L air) was the key variable to connect the correlation between temperature and concentration. This finding extends the work ofMcKernan and colleagues, CS who were unable to separate the effect of temperature and RH in their field-based work. By running tests with several different test atmosphere diacetyl concentrations over a wide range from 0.23 to 25.7 ppm, we were able to observe differences in diacetyl recovery related to theoretical diacetyl concentration. We found a large difference in diacetyl recovery between the test atmosphere diacetyl concentration of about 25 ppm and all the lower concentrations, especially at the higher AH values. The final correction equation predicts that humidity would no longer have an effect on diacetyl recovery at approximately 56 ppm, but we have no empirical data to test this prediction. Corrected diacetyl concentrations that lie outside our test atmosphere range represent extrapo lations of the models, and we have less confidence in these concentrations.\nWe do not suggest the use of the correction procedure with historical concentration data below the limit of detection (LOD), for which concentration may have been estimated (e.g. using LOD/2 or LOD/,J2°). It is not possible to know if the workplace diacetyl concentration was indeed below the LOD or if the losses due to humidity and days from sampling to extraction in the laboratory caused the sample value to be below the LOD. We did find some regions of AH and days from sampling to extraction for recovered concentra tions of 1.0 ppm or less where the full model does not con verge; however, such conditions should not occur often in the field.\nOur storage stability test findings were contrary to the NIOSH Method 2557 specification of good stability for 7 days from sampling to analysis.  This may have been due to the fact that storage stability tests completed during method development used spiked sampling tubes without using hu mid air rather than our actively sampled tubes using a test atmosphere. As our results showed, early extraction mini mized further sample loss, especially when the samples were refrigerated in accordance with the method, which means that delays in analysis after extraction should not cause ap-preciable loss. A limitation of our work is that we did not collect in-tube storage data for all the tests to determine the effect of AH on sample recovery, but we did collect data for three target test atmosphere diacetyl concentrations and three target AH values. Thus, we estimated the effect of AH and the effect of in-tube storage on different data sets and combined the two models mathematically to create the final model.\nOur correction equations accounted for about 90% of the variability in the experimental data by taking into account the effects of AH, test atmosphere diacetyl concentration, sampling flow rate, and days of in-tube storage. The variability seen in the data at any combination of AH and diacetyl concen tration values has a number of sources, including variability in keeping test atmosphere conditions constant, variability in sampling flow rates during the tests, sampling duration differences (although not found significant), and analytical laboratory variability.\nOur test atmosphere experiments used no flavoring chem icals besides diacetyl. In field situations, diacetyl may occur together with other chemicals in the air. Any effect of these mixtures on the diacetyl recovery using NIOSH Method 2557 might not be accounted for with our correction procedure.\nComparison between corrected diacetyl concentrations and the results from side-by-side samples taken with OSHA meth ods indicated a high correlation, which increases our con fidence in the applicability of the correction method. Despite the limitations, the correction procedure enables more accurate quantitative risk assessment now under way for regulatory guidance on occupational exposure to diacetyl. Representative exposures in the flavoring manufacturing industry are difficult to assess because of short-duration batch production methods in which hour-to-hour and day-to-day variations in diacetyl exposures is expected in workplaces where scores of different kinds of flavorings are manufactured. Hence, relative stabil ity of diacetyl exposures in microwave popcorn production facilities offers the advantage of less potential for exposure misclassification.\nHowever, without appropriate correction, the systematic underestimation of true diacetyl exposures in the 2000-2006 historical data would lead to overestimation of health risk associated with diacetyl exposure. Accordingly, use of our correction procedure to recalculate the historical exposure estimates from microwave popcorn production facilities previ ously studied by NIOSH and others will contribute to ongoing efforts to understand the health risk associated with occu pational exposure to diacetyl. Our experimental work may also motivate further research exploring the mechanism by which analyte recovery from CMS sorbent may be affected by sampling site humidity for a variety of analytes.\n\n【250】 #CONCLUSIONS\nW e have developed a mathematical procedure that al lows measurements from historical diacetyl samples collected and analyzed using NIOSH Method 2557, which may be biased low, to be adjusted for a more accurate exposure assessment. In addition to the historical laboratory-reported diacetyl concentrations, this correction procedure requires data on AH (determined from temperature and RH measurements) during sampling and on the number of days between sample collection and laboratory extraction of the sampling tubes. NIOSH Method 2557 should not be used to measure airborne diacetyl in future studies.\n\n【251】 #Overview\nTo estimate worker exposures for risk assessment, we developed a job exposure matrix (JEM) containing estimates of the average 8-hour, time-weighted average (TWA) exposure levels for diacetyl vapor in parts per million parts air (ppm). This JEM includes estimates for eight major job categories with selected time periods specific for each job category to reflect changes in processes and engineering controls over time. The exposure levels presented in the JEM are based on diacetyl air sampling data collected during nine industrial hygiene surveys conducted by NIOSH industrial hygienists between November 2000 and July 2003 at a microwave popcorn plant in Missouri NIOSH 2006. Details of the JEM construction are described below.\n\n【252】 #Industrial Hygiene Surveys\nA total of nine industrial hygiene surveys were conducted over a period of 4 years from 2000 to 2003. The sampling was typically conducted during the day shift, because this shift presented the opportunity to sample all job categories. However, samples were also collected from second and third shifts, but not routinely.\nPersonal breathing zone (PBZ) and area diacetyl samples were collected during these surveys using NIOSH Method 2557. These measurements were subsequently adjusted to account for interferences due to humidity and sample storage . During all surveys except the first, full-shift PBZ samples were collected from workers performing typical tasks representative of each of the major job categories. In addition, concurrent full-shift area samples were taken throughout the plant from locations where workers would typically spend their time.\nThe PBZ sample measurements were used to develop the exposure estimates for the eight job categories in the JEM. In some instances where personal diacetyl samples were not collected, for example during the first survey, area samples were used to obtain estimates of personal equivalent diacetyl exposures.\n\n【253】 #Creation of Job Categories and Estimation of Arithmetic Means\nFor the purpose of developing exposure estimates for the JEM, plant job titles were aggregated into eight job categories based primarily on work and environmental similarities with respect to potential for diacetyl exposures .\nArithmetic means (AM) using PBZ samples were calculated for the cells in the JEM as the AMs are the preferred measure of central tendency for estimating cumulative exposure in chronic disease investigations . Few PBZ measurements were collected for most job categories in each of the nine surveys (range: n= 1-6) except for the job category of Microwave line ,range n= . Moreover, a large fraction of the PBZ measurements were below the limit of detection (LOD) for most job categories (>50%) especially during surveys 6-9, except for the job categories of microwave packaging line, quality control and microwave mixing. Thus because of the small sample size and large fractions of LOD data, a simple substitution method ofreplacing LOD measurements with a value ofLOD/2 was used .\nAs noted earlier, PBZ diacetyl samples were not collected during survey 1 and had to be estimated from personal and area samples collected during subsequent surveys (i.e. surveys 2-9). A hierarchical approach was used to estimate the PBZ exposures for survey 1 depending on the job category and the availability and fraction of personal or area measurements below the LOD.\nTo start with, for jobs categories with sufficient personal and area samples in surveys 2-9, a prediction model was used to estimate personal exposures from area exposure measurements (e.g. microwave mixers, microwave line, quality control). For job categories with small sample size and/or large fraction of measurements below the LOD for surveys 2-9, the arithmetic mean of the area samples from survey 1 was assigned to personal estimates for survey 1, assuming a ratio of 1 for personal to area measurements (e.g. warehouse, outside/office, polyethylene line).\n\n【254】 #4 Creation of Exposure Periods\nAfter estimating the personal-equivalent exposures for survey 1, arithmetic means were calculated for the different time periods. Unique exposure time periods were developed for each of the eight job categories to reflect impact of the exposure control changes implemented at the plant between November 2000 to July 20\n\n【255】 #5 Adjustment for Respirator Use\nThe JEM created as described above was based on samples collected from workers breathing zone and did not account for respirator use by workers. However, during survey 4 and onward, workers in microwave mixing were using respirators and the JEM estimates were adjusted in the appropriate time periods to reflect the PPE use. Thus for the mixers during time periods 3 and 4, we adjusted the measured personal diacetyl exposure for the use of respirators. During these time periods, mixers used respiratory protection while in the mixing room and these respirators included either a P APR or air-line respirator with a loose fitting hood; both types of respirators have an applied protection factor (APF) of 25 . We assumed, based on survey observations and questionnaire responses, that mixers spent, on average, about 4 hours per shift in the mixing room in respiratory protection. Because respirators were required in the mixing room by plant management, we assumed that mixers wore respirators at all times while in the mixing room and did not wear these respirators when outside the mixing room and in the microwave packaging room. During these time periods, the mixers' desk was located in the microwave packaging room near packing line 1 so we further assumed that, when not in respirators in the mixing room, mixers would be in the microwave packaging area and receive diacetyl exposures consistent with those personal exposures measured in microwave packaging.\nThe mixer personal samples were taken outside of the respirator and would reflect both mixing and packaging exposure components. Accordingly, to adjust mixer exposures to diacetyl for the use of respirator, we  determined the mixing room exposure component from the combined mixing and packing line diacetyl concentration as reflected in the personal sample (back calculated) and  applied a protection factor of 25 to the mixing room component of the mixers exposure.\nTo determine the mixing room (A) personal diacetyl exposure from the combined mixing and packaging (C) concentration measured by personal sampling we applied the following equation:\nC = (4A(mixing) + 4B(packaging))/8; solving for A gives, A= 2C -B\nWhere A= the mixing room personal exposure component in ppm, B =the packaging room personal exposure component in ppm, and C = the measured mixer personal exposure in ppm reflecting both mixing room and packaging room components.\nTo correct the mixers exposure for the use of respiratory protection, we used the following equation:\nCR= 1h (A/25 + B) where CR= respirator adjusted mixer diacetyl exposure in ppm, A= personal mixer diacetyl exposure in the mixing room in ppm and B = personal diacetyl exposure in the microwave packaging area in ppm.\nThis adjusted diacetyl concentration in ppm was applied to mixers for time periods 3 and 4 to adjust for the use of respiratory protection by mixers while in the mixing room. Calculate ratio of the survey 3 diacetyl mean for personal samples to the average of survey 3 diacetyl mean from personal samples for polyethylene, mixer, and microwave packaging line job categories. Apply this ratio to the average of the same three groups from survey 1 after they have been converted to personal equivalent exposures.Outside Processing I Office Use the mean of the area sample diacetyl concentrations from survey\nPolyethylene Line Use the mean of the area sample diacetyl concentrations from survey\nMicrowave Mixing Model personal to area diacetyl concentrations from surveys 2-9 and apply model to survey 1 area samples to determine personal equivalent diacetyl exposures.Microwave Packaging Line Model personal to area diacetyl concentrations from surveys 2-9 and apply model to survey 1 area samples to estimate personal equivalent exposures.\nBag Print Use the average of the personal equivalent diacetyl exposures for survey 1 from the microwave packaging line and warehouse job categories. (Note: there were no bag print area diacetyl samples for survey 1) 8 Quality Control Model personal to area diacetyl concentrations from surveys 2-9 and apply model to survey 1 area samples to determine personal equivalent diacetyl exposures.\nMicrowave ovens moved into popping room in quality control lab 14 -18, 2003 Time 3 (Surveys 4 -7 sampling results): Reflects the control changes including the installation of an outside supply air intake system providing clean, tempered air into the warehouse, the completion of LEV ventilation on mezzanine flavor holding tanks and the air-lock installation on the mixing room. All these microwave mixing and production control changes would impact maintenance workers since they would work in these production areas. Also, maintenance exposures during this time period were still primarily above the LOD. Time 4 (Surveys 8 & 9 sampling results): Reflects the control changes including first use of enclosure of the mezzanine tanks. Additionally, maintenance exposures during this time period were largely below detectable limits.\nOutside Processing I Office Workers:\nTime I (Surveys I -9 sampling results): Reflects low, predominantly non-detectable exposures for workers who were outside (outside processing) or normally away from microwave mixing and production operations.\nTime I : Reflects polyethylene line worker exposures before major control changes in the microwave production area that could impact polyethylene line workers; although exposures in this category were low by comparison to microwave production lines, there were some detectable diacetyl exposures in personal and area samples for polyethylene line workers during this time period so a separate time period was used. While the polyethylene lines were located away from the microwave production area, there was some potential for exposure in this work group prior to control changes. Reflects the first use of the new mixing room and the addition of new mixing room exhaust fans. This period also reflects enclosure of the mezzanine area reducing microwave production exposures outside the mixing room below quantifiable or detectable levels.\nBag Printing: Time 1 (Survey 1 & 2 sampling results): Reflects exposures before major control changes that would impact bag printing exposures due to close proximity to the microwave production lines. Also, when the bag printing operations were shut down, bag print workers would often work on the microwave production lines. Time 2 (Survey 3 sampling results): Reflects the first control changes implemented in the microwave mixing room including the addition of exhaust ventilation, closed transfer of liquid flavorings, and flavor tank ventilation. These control changes would impact bag printing exposures since the bag print lines were located in the warehouse just outside a large open doorway into microwave production; additionally, when the bag printing operations were shut down, bag print workers would often work on the microwave production lines.\nTime 3 (Surveys 4 -7 sampling results): Reflects several control changes including the installation of an outside supply air intake system providing clean, tempered air into the warehouse and subsequently for microwave production area exhaust fans. This period also reflects completion of LEV ventilation on mezzanine flavor holding tanks and air-lock installation isolating the mixing room from packaging areas.\nTypical protocol for collecting air samples for diacetyl and 2, 3-pentanedione.\nThis protocol, which is based on OSHA pentanedione. It consists of two silica gel tubes connected in series using the least amount as possible flexible tubing.\n\n【256】 #Preparation\nBefore entering the work area all members of the sampling team should be made aware of any requirements for safety equipment such as hair nets, respirators, or safety shoes, and possess all necessary equipment and training, including respirator certification if needed. Procedures and schedules should be coordinated with the analytical laboratory to assure compatibility of procedures and availability of personnel to process samples in a timely manner.\nAll sampling equipment and supplies should be prepared in advance. Equipment may include battery powered personal sampling pumps capable of operating in the appropriate flow rate range and pressure drop, chargers for those pumps, sample holders of a size compatible with the sampling media, and flexible tubing to connect pumps and sample holders. In this protocol diacetyl and 2, 3-pentanedione vapor samples are collected with two silica gel sorbent tubes in series ,SKC Inc.Eighty Four,PA. The front tube is connected to the back tube with a piece of tubing to form the sampling train. If the sample holders are not opaque, these sorbent tubes should be wrapped in foil or opaque tape during and after sampling to prevent 2 exposure to light. Each sampling tube should be marked with a unique identification number, either before or after sampling. This information is entered in the field data sheet along with the corresponding pump ID, calibrated flow rate, and other information. A useful convention is to mark each of the two tubes of a sample with the same initial identifier, then add an \"f' for the front tube and an \"r\" for the rear tube.\nSampling trains should be assembled and calibrated with sampling media in line, and this sampling media should not be used for any other purpose. Nominal sampling rates for this method are 0.05 Lpm for 180-minute TWA samples and 0.2 Lpm for 15-minute STEL samples.\nCalibrated flow rate for each pump should be recorded on a field data sheet with an identification code for that pump. A supply of belts, clips, tape, and miscellaneous tools should be available to attach the sampling trains to workers to minimize interference or safety concerns with their jobs.\n\n【257】 #Collection\nTo collect samples for the full work shift, the sampling team should be prepared to place sampling trains on the workers as they begin their shifts. Workers and locations to be evaluated should have been previously identified from knowledge of the tasks to be performed and the compounds to be used. A common practice in selecting sampling locations is to choose tasks anticipated to produce the greatest level of exposure to diacetyl or 2, 3-pentanedione and to sample the workers conducting those tasks or collect area samples in those areas. This allows for the greatest likelihood of obtaining samples above the limit of detection for the analytical method, and assumes that if exposure is controlled so that the highest exposures are within allowable limits then all exposures are within those limits.\nImmediately before sampling, break off both ends of the flame-sealed tube to provide an opening approximately half the internal diameter of the tube. Attach the tube holder to the worker so that the adsorbent tube is in an approximately vertical position with the inlet in the breathing zone.\nPosition the sampling pump, tube holder, and tubing so they do not impede work performance or safety. As each sampling train is placed and started, the start time should be noted on the field data sheet for that pump, along with the name or other identifier of the person wearing that pump, job title or a description of tasks, and location within the work facility. Sampling site temperature, relative humidity, barometric pressure, and any other relevant observations should be recorded on field data sheets throughout the duration of sampling. Members of the sampling team should rotate among the sampling locations during the collection of samples. They should occasionally check all sampling devices, observe workers tasks, and note observations on the field data sheet. The use of personal protective equipment and other safety and health controls, ventilation, and all other salient observations should also be noted. Attempt to determine through observation and discussions if workers are engaging in \"normal operations.\"\nOSHA states a reliable quantitation limit of 1.3 ppb ( 4.57 ug/m 3 ) for diacetyl and 9.3 ppb (38 µg/m 3 ) for 2, 3-pentanedione with a 180-minute sample duration and a flow rate of 0.05 lpm (or 15 minutes at 0.2 lpm). If the shift being sampled is 8 hours long, three samples approaching 180 minutes would be acceptable to obtain a TWA analyte concentration. These samples should be able to quantify diacetyl and 2, 3-pentanedione at the REL of 5 ppb TWA or 25 ppb STEL without exceeding the breakthrough capacity of the sorbent media.\n\n【258】 #Sampling Surveys\nEmployers shall conduct exposure monitoring surveys to ensure that worker exposures (measured by full-shift samples) do not exceed the REL, either on a time weighted or short term basis. Because adverse respiratory health effects may occur at the REL, it is desirable to achieve lower concentrations whenever possible. When workers are potentially exposed to airborne flavoring compounds, employers shall conduct exposure monitoring surveys as follows:\n- Collect representative personal samples over the entire work shift .\n- Perform periodic sampling at least annually and whenever any major process change takes place or whenever another reason exists to suspect that exposure concentrations may have changed.\n- If workers are exposed to concentrations above the REL, perform more frequent exposure monitoring as engineering changes are implemented and until at least two consecutive samples indicate that exposures no longer exceed the REL .\n- Notify all workers of monitoring results and of any actions taken to reduce their exposures.\n- When developing an exposure sampling strategy, consider variations in work and production schedules as well as the inherent variability in most area sampling .\n\n【259】 #Focused sampling\nWhen sampling to determine whether worker exposures to diacetyl or 2, 3-pentanedione are below the REL, a focused sampling strategy may be more practical than a random sampling approach. A focused sampling strategy targets workers perceived to be exposed to the highest concentrations of a hazardous substance . This strategy is most efficient for identifying exposures above the REL if maximum-risk workers and time periods are accurately identified. Short tasks involving high concentrations of airborne vapors could result in elevated exposure over full work shifts.\n\n【260】 #Area sampling\nArea sampling may be useful in exposure monitoring to determine sources of airborne diacetyl or 2, 3-pentanedione, and to assess the effectiveness of engineering controls.\n\n【261】 #Post-collection\nAfter sampling for the appropriate time, remove the sampling train, record stop time, and remove equipment to an uncontaminated area where you can separate the tubes, and seal each tube with plastic end caps. Although tubes were protected from light during sampling, it is also necessary to wrap each tube in aluminum foil or opaque tape making sure that the sample identification number is observable. Samples should be shipped cold (preferable via an overnight carrier) to the accredited analytical laboratory using a \"six-pack\" cooler and frozen ice packs (Blue Ice) or similar means to refrigerate samples. Submit blank samples as discussed with the laboratory with each set of samples. Handle the blank samples in the same manner as the other samples except draw no air through them.\nMeasure the air flow rate through each sampling train (using surrogate sampling media in line, not the actual sample), record this post-sampling flow rate. Determine total sampling time (minutes), mean sampling flow rate, and sample volumes (liters). Place sampling pumps on charge for reuse in required.\nSubmit the samples to the laboratory for analysis as soon as possible after sampling. As a precaution, store the samples at refrigerator temperature if a delay in shipment is unavoidable.\nShip any bulk samples separate from the air samples.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type2": "", "type3": "无关文本#120#120# and 2,3-Pentanedione 1后面的1\n无关文本#182#182# l!l  0 (.) \"’ @ <,\n无关文本#183#183# l!l  0 (.) \"’ @ ", "type4": "语义不完整#1#1#the animal-based后面缺少内容\n语义不完整#40#40# 2004a; .感觉中间缺少内容\n语义不完整#70#70#Impairment at Company G后面缺少内容\n语义不完整#72#72#ILRT=7.97, 2df, p=.后面缺少内容\n语义不完整#75#75#coef.=−后面缺少内容\n语义不完整#77#77#variability in susceptibility:后面缺少内容\n语义不完整#134#134#manufacturing industry -California, 20  后面缺少内容"}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-05-08 01:37:58", "update_time": "2024-05-08 02:27:59"}

Significant expertise is required from a range of healthcare professionals because of the involvement of anatomically diverse areas (soft tissue, bones, skin, and a variety of glands and organs), as well, because of the vital functions affected by both the cancer and the treatment (breathing, chewing, swallowing and speech).\n\n【1】 The goal of this clinical practice guideline is to outline the recommendations for the organization and delivery of healthcare services for head and neck cancer patients in Alberta. In an effort to reduce duplication of work, Cancer Care Ontario's recommendations have been adopted and adapted with some customizations to better fit the Alberta context. The recommendations in this clinical practice guideline should be used as a guide rather than a fixed protocol. The implementation of this clinical practice guideline will depend on many factors besides the quality and credibility of the guidelines. Among those factors are sufficient funding to support full implementation and judgement used by healthcare professionals to form the multidisciplinary team and individualize care for head and neck cancer patients.\n\n【2】 #Search Strategy\nThe biomedical literature was searched using the database PubMed. The search terms \"head and neck neoplasm\" and \"organization and delivery\" were combined using the Boolean operator term \"and\" to find publications pertaining to the chosen terms. Limits were not set for the search (e.g. language or publication type). As a result, 161 publications were identified. All abstracts were considered for possible inclusion. Publications that only described the effectiveness or feasibility of equipment, testing, or treatment, were not included in the evidence (e.g. endoscopic intubation with conventional plastic stents, intensity-modulated radiotherapy).\nThe websites of prominent national and international clinical practice guideline developers were also searched for recommendations about the organization and delivery of health care services for head and neck cancers. In total, seven websites were searched in addition to the SAGE Directory (Standards and Guidelines Evidence) on The Canadian Partnership Against Cancer's website.  Target Population\nThe recommendations outlined in this guideline are intended for adults over the age of 18 years with head and neck cancer. Different principles may apply to pediatric patients.\nThese recommendations were adapted from: Organizational guidance for the care of patients with head-and-neck cancer in Ontario, 2019\nPhysiotherapist 1, 2  Occupational Therapist 1, 2  Radiation Physicist 1, 2  Radiation Therapist 1, 2  Respiratory Therapist 1  Hyperbaric medicine 1  Home care team 1  Dermatologist\n- Specific minimum qualifications are required of individual practitioners on the core team responsible for managing patients with head and neck cancer . These qualifications were adapted from Cancer Care Ontario 1 and in some instances have been modified and expanded to reflect knowledge from practice experiences in Alberta.\n\n【3】 #Cancer Centre and Team Member Volumes\n- The management of head and neck cancer patients is complex. The initial phases of care and ongoing care of all head and neck cancer patients should be centered at a single, high-volume centre with adequate support and expertise to provide the highest level of care. - All patients with a new diagnosis of invasive head and neck cancer should be seen at a head and neck multidisciplinary clinic prior to initiation of treatment by the designated head and neck multidisciplinary team. These patients should subsequently be discussed at regularly scheduled Tumour Conference Rounds attended by the members of the core team to ensure consensus opinion on treatment and quality assurance. - Although the development of centres of excellence is strongly encouraged, innovative collaborations between high-volume and low-volume centres and/or regions should be expanded and defined in order to maintain the high quality of care being provided to head and neck cancer patients 2 after the initial management phases.\n- The development of small-volume, non-multidisciplinary treatment programs for patients with head and neck cancer is strongly discouraged.\n\n【4】 #Multidisciplinary Care Requirements\n- Head and neck centres will provide surgery, radiation, and systemic therapy.\n- All head and neck cancer patients require a multidisciplinary assessment by a head and neck surgical oncologist and a radiation oncologist with expertise in head and neck oncological cases at a minimum and should receive assessment by medical oncology as needed.\nAssessments can occur via multidisciplinary tumor board review or via in person assessment in a combined clinic.\n- Where geography makes it difficult for patients to travel to be seen in person, assessment must include examination by an otolaryngologist/head and neck surgeon who is available in the local community. In addition, patients must be reviewed at a MCC with a head and neck surgical oncologist in attendance or by virtual review of the images and clinical examination by a head and neck surgical oncologist.\n- The Head and Neck Oncologic Program must function within an acute care hospital and be affiliated with a regional cancer program. The program must have access to regular ambulatory care facilities, diagnostic and staging expertise and equipment, inpatient resources, and operating room access for cancer surgery.\n\n【5】 #Team member\nMinimum volumes required", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": "无关文本#2#2#Physiotherapist 1, 2  Occupational Therapist 1, 2  Radiation Physicist 1, 2  Radiation Therapist 1, 2  Respiratory Therapist 1  Hyperbaric medicine 1  Home care team 1    Cancer Care Ontario 1 里面的数字应该是无关引用\n无关文本#3#3#neck cancer patients 2  数字是无关引用", "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-05-08 01:37:58", "update_time": "2024-05-08 21:42:20"}

When managed in hospital, the diagnosis is usually confirmed by chest X‑ray. For the purpose of this guideline, pneumonia that develops in hospital after intubation (ventilator-associated pneumonia) is excluded from this definition\n\n【9】 #Summary of the evidence\nThis is a summary of the evidence\nHospital-acquired pneumonia is a lower respiratory tract infection that may be life threatening.\nEarly-onset hospital-acquired pneumonia (less than 5 days after admission to hospital) is usually caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae and late-onset (more than 5 days after admission to hospital) is usually caused by microorganisms that are acquired in hospital, most commonly methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other non-pseudomonal gram-negative bacteria.\nNo evidence from systematic reviews or randomised controlled trials (RCTs) was identified in children or young people under 18 years.\n\n【10】 #Antibiotic prescribing strategies\nAn antibiotic prescribing strategy . Bronchoscopy was carried out within 24 hours of clinical diagnosis and gram-stain results (available 4 hours to 6 hours after bronchoscopy) were used to modify treatment.\nThe total costs (antibiotics and bronchoscopy) of each strategy were not significantly different overall.\nThe overall incidence of multidrug-resistant bacteria was significantly higher with very broad antimicrobial cover followed by de‑escalation, compared with empirical antibiotics.\nEvidence for antibiotic prescribing strategies is based on 2 RCTs .\nCommittee discussion on antibiotic prescribing strategies\nThe committee noted that the bronchoscopy antibiotic prescribing strategy used by Herer et al.  was not consistent with clinical practice in the UK; culture results are not usually available within 24 hours and sputum cultures are more common than gram staining of bronchoscopy samples.\n\n【11】 ## Efficacy of antibiotics\nOverall, there were no differences in the clinical effectiveness (clinical cure or mortality) in a range of antibiotic comparisons in adults with hospital-acquired pneumonia:\npenicillin with beta-lactamase inhibitor\ncephalosporin with beta-lactamase inhibitor\ntetracycline\nfluoroquinolone\nglycopeptide .\nEvidence for efficacy of antibiotics is based on 6 RCTs .\n\n【12】 ## Safety of antibiotics\nAbout 10% of the general population claim to have a penicillin allergy; this is often because of a skin rash that occurred while taking a course of penicillin as a child. Fewer than 10% of people who think they are allergic to penicillin are truly allergic\nPeople with a history of immediate hypersensitivity to penicillins may also react to cephalosporins and other beta‑lactam antibiotics (BNF, August 2019).\nMacrolides (for example, clarithromycin) should be used with caution in people with a predisposition to QT interval prolongation (BNF, August 2019).\nTetracyclines (for example, doxycycline), can deposit in growing bone and teeth (by binding to calcium) causing staining and occasionally dental hypoplasia. They should not be given to pregnant or breastfeeding women, and use in children under 12 years is either contraindicated or cautioned for use in severe or life-threatening infections where there are no alternatives (BNF, August 2019).\nCo-trimoxazole is associated with rare but serious side effects including blood disorders and Stevens–Johnson syndrome. It is cautioned for use in older people because there is an increased risk of serious adverse effects, and in those with a predisposition to hyperkalaemia. Monitoring of blood counts is recommended with prolonged treatment (BNF, August 2019).\n\n【13】 Glycopeptide (for example, vancomycin and teicoplanin) doses are based on body weight. Therapeutic drug monitoring and monitoring of various patient parameters including blood count, urinalysis, auditory function, hepatic function and renal function is recommended depending on the particular glycopeptide (BNF, August 2019).\nSevere optic neuropathy can occur with linezolid, particularly if used for longer than 28 days. Blood disorders have also been reported and weekly full blood counts are recommended (BNF, August 2019).\nOverall, there were no significant differences in adverse effects in the studies between antibiotics or classes of antibiotics in people with hospital-acquired pneumonia.\nTreatment-related adverse events were significantly higher with moxifloxacin compared with a cephalosporin (intravenous ceftriaxone then oral cefuroxime; 30% versus 16%, number needed to harm  7 ).\nSignificantly more people stopped treatment because of adverse events with tigecycline than with imipenem with cilastatin (10.9% versus 6.6%, NNH 23 ).\nthe summaries of product characteristics for information on contraindications, cautions, drug interactions and adverse effects of individual medicines.\nCommittee discussion on choice of antibiotics\nThe committee agreed that prompt antibiotic treatment should be offered to everyone with hospital-acquired pneumonia.\nThe committee discussed the definition of hospital-acquired pneumonia. Because it includes people with pneumonia that develops 48 hours or more after hospital admission and that was not incubating at hospital admission, the committee agreed that the NICE guideline on community-acquired pneumonia should be followed for people with symptoms or signs of pneumonia starting on days 1 or 2 after hospital admission.\nGiven the clinical expertise needed for assessing and managing hospital-acquired pneumonia in very young children (under 1 month), the committee agreed that the choice of antibiotic in these children should be based on local resistance data and specialist microbiological advice.\nOverall, the limited evidence showed no differences in clinical effectiveness between different broad-spectrum antibiotics or classes of antibiotics, with some small differences in the rates of adverse effects. The committee noted the high rates of adverse events for many broad-spectrum antibiotics included in the studies.\nBased on experience, the committee agreed that there are several factors that need to be taken into account when choosing an antibiotic, including the severity of symptoms or signs. The committee did not know of any validated tools for assessing the severity of hospital-acquired pneumonia, and therefore agreed that this should be based on clinical judgement.\nThe committee also agreed that recent use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and recent contact with healthcare services before the current hospital admission were also highly likely to increase the risk of resistant pathogens.\nFor adults with non‑severe symptoms or signs who are not at higher risk of resistance, with penicillin allergy or in whom co‑amoxiclav is unsuitable (for example, because of local resistance data), the committee agreed that the choice of an alternative antibiotic should be based on local resistance data and specialist microbiological advice only. They agreed that options include:\ndoxycycline (a tetracycline)\ncefalexin (a cephalosporin; not suitable if there is a risk of penicillin-resistant pneumococci)\nco‑trimoxazole (trimethoprim plus a sulfonamide)\nlevofloxacin (a fluoroquinolone; only to be used when switching from IV antibiotics, following specialist advice).\nCo‑trimoxazole and levofloxacin are not licensed for hospital-acquired pneumonia, so use would be off-label.\nIn children and young people with penicillin allergy or in whom co‑amoxiclav is unsuitable, the alternative antibiotic is clarithromycin (a macrolide); this has good activity against common pathogens and is appropriate for use in children and young people. However, the committee recognised that other options may be suitable based on local resistance data and specialist microbiological advice.\npiperacillin with tazobactam (an antipseudomonal penicillin with a beta-lactamase inhibitor)\nceftazidime (a third-generation cephalosporin)\nmeropenem (a carbapenem; in adults)\nceftazidime with avibactam (a third-generation cephalosporin with a beta-lactamase inhibitor; in adults)\nlevofloxacin (in adults).\nThese antibiotics have good activity against common pathogens in this population, including multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa, ESBLs and some carbapenemase-producing gram-negative bacteria.\nvancomycin (a glycopeptide)\nteicoplanin (a glycopeptide)\nlinezolid (an oxazolidinone; if vancomycin cannot be used, following specialist advice only). Linezolid is not licensed in children and young people under 18 years, so use would be off-label.\n\n【14】 #Antibiotic course length, dosage and route of administration\nNo systematic reviews or RCTs were identified that compared antibiotic course lengths, dosage or route of administration.\nCommittee discussions on antibiotic course length, dosage and route of administration\nThe committee agreed that the shortest course that is likely to be effective should be prescribed to reduce the risk of antimicrobial resistance and adverse effects from broad-spectrum antibiotics. However, hospital-acquired pneumonia is a serious infection with a high-mortality risk and needs effective treatment.\nBased on its experience and extrapolation of evidence for people with community-acquired pneumonia , the committee agreed that a total course of 5 days of antibiotics was the minimum required.\nIn line with the NICE guideline on antimicrobial stewardship and Public Health England's Start smart – then focus, oral antibiotics should be given first line if the person can take them, and if the severity of their infection does not require intravenous antibiotics. The use of intravenous antibiotics should be reviewed by 48 hours (taking into account the person's response to treatment and any microbiological results) and switched to oral treatment where possible.\nFor people with severe symptoms or signs or at higher risk of resistance, the committee agreed that intravenous antibiotics should always be given initially\n\n【15】 #Other considerations\n\n【16】 #Medicines adherence\nMedicines adherence may be a problem for some people taking antibiotics that need frequent dosing or longer treatment duration .\n\n【17】 implications\nRecommended antibiotics (except ceftazidime with avibactam) are available as generic formulations.  the Drug Tariff and the BNF for costs.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": "无关文本#3#3# see the NICE guideline on sepsis\n", "type4": "语义不完整#6#6#/125 mg three \nmg on first day, \nmg twice or three\nmg twice a day for前面都缺少内容\n语义不完整#7#7#g three times a day\ng once a day\ng to 1 g three times a day\n/0.5 g three times a day\nmg/kg to 20 mg/kg前面都缺少内容", "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-05-08 01:37:58", "update_time": "2024-05-08 19:50:31"}

The CRA encourages rheumatologists to provide the best care for individual patients and be fiscally responsible for the benefit of society as a whole. Rheumatologists should consider choosing the most cost-effective product when there is a choice available between an originator biologic and a biosimilar and must be mindful of cost savings. It is imperative that any substitution or transition/change to an approved biosimilar should result in no additional cost to the patient. The CRA recognizes the administrative challenges that patients may experience in accessing a biologic agent and therefore strongly encourages industry to provide and/or maintain patient support programs.\n\n【1】 #Biologic naïve patients:\nFor a patient new to a specific biologic, cost effectiveness should be considered when there is an available choice between an originator biologic and one or more biosimilars.\n\n【2】 #Transitioning and changing for patients on biologics:\nThere must be a respectful and informed conversation between the rheumatologist and patient prior to any transitioning/changing from an originator biologic to a biosimilar. Any change to or new start with a biosimilar must take into account agents which are the best tolerated and have the appropriate formulation.\n- Substitution by someone other than the prescriber: a. Notification of an intended substitution must be given to the prescribing rheumatologist and patient. b. There will be no substitution without an informed consultation by the patient with the prescribing rheumatologist prior to any treatment change. Thus, when a substitution is proposed, at least 6 months is required to allow sufficient time for a prescriber patient dialogue to occur.\n\n【3】 #Highlights of Changes:\nThe position statement was updated to form a general statement applicable to all rheumatology populations and rheumatic diseases. Specific recommendations regarding pediatric populations and off label medication usage were removed.\nc. In the event of substitution, the originator biologic must continue to be provided until access to the biosimilar is confirmed and available, without any interruption in patient care. d. The CRA encourages payers to have a process in place via which the patient can revert to the original biologic agent in a timely fashion if there is a clinically relevant flare-up of the disease after an appropriate trial with up to two biosimilars; or if there is intolerance to the new formulation and alternate appropriate biosimilars are not available (e.g. citrate free or pediatric appropriate formulations).\n- The naming of biosimilars should be clear to enable tracking and post-marketing surveillance of new originator biologics and biosimilars, especially as new products enter the market.\n\n【4】 #Terminology clarification\nBridges et al.

Smoking\nWomen who smoke should be informed that this is likely to reduce their fertility.\nMen who smoke should be informed that there is an association between smoking and reduced semen quality (although the impact of this on male fertility is uncertain), and that stopping smoking will improve their general health.\n\n【10】 ## Caffeinated beverages\nPeople who are concerned about their fertility should be informed that there is no consistent evidence of an association between consumption of caffeinated beverages (tea, coffee and colas) and fertility problems. \n\n【11】 ## Obesity\nWomen who have a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or over should be informed that they are likely to take longer to conceive.\nWomen should be informed that participating in a group programme involving exercise and dietary advice leads to more pregnancies than weight loss advice alone.\nMen who have a BMI of 30 or over should be informed that they are likely to have reduced fertility.\n\n【12】 ## Low body weight\nWomen who have a BMI of less than 19 and who have irregular menstruation or are not menstruating should be advised that increasing body weight is likely to improve their chance of conception.\n\n【13】 ## Tight underwear\nMen should be informed that there is an association between elevated scrotal temperature and reduced semen quality, but that it is uncertain whether wearing loose-fitting underwear improves fertility.\n\n【14】 ## Occupation\nSome occupations involve exposure to hazards that can reduce male or female fertility and therefore a specific enquiry about occupation should be made to people who are concerned about their fertility, and appropriate advice should be offered.\n\n【15】 ## Prescribed, over-the-counter and recreational drug use\nA number of prescription, over-the-counter and recreational drugs interfere with male and female fertility, and therefore a specific enquiry about these should be made to people who are concerned about their fertility, and appropriate advice should be offered.\n\n【16】 ## Complementary therapy\nPeople who are concerned about their fertility should be informed that the effectiveness of complementary therapies for fertility problems has not been properly evaluated and that further research is needed before such interventions can be recommended.\n\n【17】 ## Folic acid supplementation\nWomen intending to become pregnant should be informed that dietary supplementation with folic acid before conception and up to 12 weeks' gestation reduces the risk of having a baby with neural tube defects. The recommended dose is 0.4 mg per day. For women who have previously had an infant with a neural tube defect or who are receiving anti-epileptic medication or who have diabetes , a higher dose of 5 mg per day is recommended.\n\n【18】 ## Defining infertility\nPeople who are concerned about delays in conception should be offered an initial assessment. A specific enquiry about lifestyle and sexual history should be taken to identify people who are less likely to conceive.\nOffer an initial consultation to discuss the options for attempting conception to people who are unable to, or would find it very difficult to, have vaginal intercourse.\nThe environment in which investigation of fertility problems takes place should enable people to discuss sensitive issues such as sexual abuse.\nHealthcare professionals should define infertility in practice as the period of time people have been trying to conceive without success after which formal investigation is justified and possible treatment implemented.\nA woman of reproductive age who has not conceived after 1 year of unprotected vaginal sexual intercourse, in the absence of any known cause of infertility, should be offered further clinical assessment and investigation along with her partner.\nthe woman is aged 36 years or over there is a known clinical cause of infertility or a history of predisposing factors for infertility.\nWhere treatment is planned that may result in infertility (such as treatment for cancer), early fertility specialist referral should be offered.\n\n【19】 ## Semen analysis\n\n【20】 semen volume: 1.5 ml or more pH: 7.2 or more sperm concentration: 15 million spermatozoa per ml or more total sperm number: 39 million spermatozoa per ejaculate or more total motility (percentage of progressive motility and non-progressive motility): 40% or more motile or 32% or more with progressive motility vitality: 58% or more live spermatozoa sperm morphology (percentage of normal forms): 4% or more\nScreening for antisperm antibodies should not be offered because there is no evidence of effective treatment to improve fertility.\nIf the result of the first semen analysis is abnormal, a repeat confirmatory test should be offered.\nRepeat confirmatory tests should ideally be undertaken 3 months after the initial analysis to allow time for the cycle of spermatozoa formation to be completed. However, if a gross spermatozoa deficiency (azoospermia or severe oligozoospermia) has been detected, the repeat test should be undertaken as soon as possible.\n\n【21】 ## Post-coital testing of cervical mucus\nThe routine use of post-coital testing of cervical mucus in the investigation of fertility problems is not recommended because it has no predictive value on pregnancy rate.\n\n【22】 ## Ovarian reserve testing\nUse a woman's age as an initial predictor of her overall chance of success through natural conception  or with IVF .\ntotal antral follicle count of less than or equal to 4 for a low response (follicles of less than or equal to 5 mm measured by transvaginal ultrasound on day 3 of cycle: low response was less than 4 oocytes) , and greater than 16 for a high response (follicles of 2 to 10 mm measured by transvaginal ultrasound on day 3 of cycle: high response was more than or equal to 15 oocytes or more than or equal to 20 oocytes)\nanti-Müllerian hormone of less than or equal to 5.4 pmol/l for a low response (Beckman–Coulter assay: poor response defined as less than 4 oocytes or cancellation), and greater than or equal to 25.0 pmol/l for a high response (Beckman–Coulter or DSL assays: defined high response as more than or equal to 15 oocytes to more than 21 oocytes)\nfollicle-stimulating hormone greater than 8.9 IU/l for a low response, and less than 4 IU/l for a high response (long protocol of down-regulation: low response defined as less than 4 oocytes or cancellation; high response defined as more than 20 oocytes).\nDo not use any of the following tests individually to predict any outcome of fertility treatment:\n-varian volume inhibin B\n-estradiol (E2).\n\n【23】 ## Regularity of menstrual cycles\nWomen who are concerned about their fertility should be asked about the frequency and regularity of their menstrual cycles. Women with regular monthly menstrual cycles should be informed that they are likely to be ovulating.\nThe use of basal body temperature charts to confirm ovulation does not reliably predict ovulation and is not recommended.\n\n【24】 ## Prolactin measurement\nWomen who are concerned about their fertility should not be offered a blood test to measure prolactin. This test should only be offered to women who have an ovulatory disorder, galactorrhoea or a pituitary tumour.\n\n【25】 ## Thyroid function tests\nWomen with possible fertility problems are no more likely than the general population to have thyroid disease and the routine measurement of thyroid function should not be offered. Estimation of thyroid function should be confined to women with symptoms of thyroid disease.\n\n【26】 ## Endometrial biopsy\nWomen should not be offered an endometrial biopsy to evaluate the luteal phase as part of the investigation of fertility problems because there is no evidence that medical treatment of luteal phase defect improves pregnancy rates.\n\n【27】 ## Investigation of suspected tubal and uterine abnormalities\nWomen who are not known to have comorbidities (such as pelvic inflammatory disease, previous ectopic pregnancy or endometriosis) should be offered hysterosalpingography (HSG) to screen for tubal occlusion because this is a reliable test for ruling out tubal occlusion, and it is less invasive and makes more efficient use of resources than laparoscopy.\nWhere appropriate expertise is available, screening for tubal occlusion using hysterosalpingo-contrast-ultrasonography should be considered because it is an effective alternative to HSG for women who are not known to have comorbidities.\nWomen who are thought to have comorbidities should be offered laparoscopy and dye so that tubal and other pelvic pathology can be assessed at the same time.\n\n【28】 ## Testing for viral status\nPeople undergoing IVF treatment should be offered testing for HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C.\n\n【29】 ## Viral transmission\nFor couples where the man is HIV positive, any decision about fertility management should be the result of discussions between the couple, a fertility specialist and an HIV specialist.\nAdvise couples where the man is HIV positive that the risk of HIV transmission to the female partner is negligible through unprotected sexual intercourse when all of the following criteria are met:\nthe man is compliant with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)\nthe man has had a plasma viral load of less than 50 copies/ml for more than 6 months there are no other infections present unprotected intercourse is limited to the time of ovulation.\nFor partners of people with hepatitis B, offer vaccination before starting fertility treatment.\nDo not offer sperm washing as part of fertility treatment for men with hepatitis B.\nMen with hepatitis C should discuss treatment options to eradicate the hepatitis C with their appropriate specialist before conception is considered.\n\n【30】 ## Susceptibility to rubella\nWomen who are concerned about their fertility should be offered testing for their rubella status so that those who are susceptible to rubella can be offered vaccination. Women who are susceptible to rubella should be offered vaccination and advised not to become pregnant for at least 1 month following vaccination.\n\n【31】 ## Cervical cancer screening\nTo avoid delay in fertility treatment, a specific enquiry about the timing and result of the most recent cervical smear test should be made to women who are concerned about their fertility. Cervical screening should be offered in accordance with the national cervical screening programme guidance.\n\n【32】 ## Screening for Chlamydia trachomatis\nBefore undergoing uterine instrumentation, women should be offered screening for Chlamydia trachomatis using an appropriately sensitive technique.\nIf the result of a test for Chlamydia trachomatis is positive, women and their sexual partners should be referred for appropriate management with treatment and contact tracing.\nProphylactic antibiotics should be considered before uterine instrumentation if screening has not been carried out.\n\n【33】 ## Medical management (male factor infertility)\nMen with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism should be offered gonadotrophin drugs because these are effective in improving fertility.\nMen with leucocytes in their semen should not be offered antibiotic treatment unless there is an identified infection because there is no evidence that this improves pregnancy rates.\n\n【34】 ## Surgical management (male factor infertility)\nWhere appropriate expertise is available, men with obstructive azoospermia should be offered surgical correction of epididymal blockage because it is likely to restore patency of the duct and improve fertility. Surgical correction should be considered as an alternative to surgical sperm recovery and IVF.\nMen should not be offered surgery for varicoceles as a form of fertility treatment because it does not improve pregnancy rates.\n\n【35】 ## Management of ejaculatory failure\nTreatment of ejaculatory failure can restore fertility without the need for invasive methods of sperm retrieval or the use of assisted reproduction procedures. However, further evaluation of different treatment options is needed.\n\n【36】 ## Classification of ovulatory disorders\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) classifies ovulation disorders into 3 groups:\nGroup 1: hypothalamic pituitary failure (hypothalamic amenorrhoea or hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism)\nGroup 3: ovarian failure.\n\n【37】 ## WHO Group 1 ovulation disorders\nAdvise women with WHO Group 1 anovulatory infertility that they can improve their chance of regular ovulation, conception and an uncomplicated pregnancy by:\nincreasing their body weight if they have a BMI of less than 19 and/or moderating their exercise levels if they undertake high levels of exercise.\nOffer women with WHO Group 1 ovulation disorders pulsatile administration of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone or gonadotrophins with luteinising hormone activity to induce ovulation.\n\n【38】 ## WHO Group 2 ovulation disorders\n\n【39】 Women with WHO Group 2 ovulation disorders receiving first-line treatment for ovarian stimulation\nAdvise women with WHO Group 2 anovulatory infertility who have a BMI of 30 or over to lose weight . Inform them that this alone may restore ovulation, improve their response to ovulation induction agents, and have a positive impact on pregnancy outcomes.\nOffer women with WHO Group 2 anovulatory infertility 1 of the following treatments, taking into account potential adverse effects, ease and mode of use, the woman's BMI, and monitoring needed:\nclomifene citrate or metformin or a combination of the above.\nFor women who are taking clomifene citrate, offer ultrasound monitoring during at least the first cycle of treatment to ensure that they are taking a dose that minimises the risk of multiple pregnancy.\nWomen prescribed metformin should be informed of the side effects associated with its use (such as nausea, vomiting and other gastrointestinal disturbances).\nlaparoscopic ovarian drilling or combined treatment with clomifene citrate and metformin if not already offered as first-line treatment or gonadotrophins.\nWomen with polycystic ovary syndrome who are being treated with gonadotrophins should not be offered treatment with gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist concomitantly because it does not improve pregnancy rates, and it is associated with an increased risk of ovarian hyperstimulation.\nThe use of adjuvant growth hormone treatment with gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist and/or human menopausal gonadotrophin during ovulation induction in women with polycystic ovary syndrome who do not respond to clomifene citrate is not recommended because it does not improve pregnancy rates.\n\n【40】 ## Hyperprolactinaemic amenorrhoea – dopamine agonists\nWomen with ovulatory disorders due to hyperprolactinaemia should be offered treatment with dopamine agonists such as bromocriptine. Consideration should be given to safety for use in pregnancy and minimising cost when prescribing.\n\n【41】 ## Monitoring ovulation induction during gonadotrophin therapy\nWomen who are offered ovulation induction with gonadotrophins should be informed about the risk of multiple pregnancy and ovarian hyperstimulation before starting treatment.\nOvarian ultrasound monitoring to measure follicular size and number should be an integral part of gonadotrophin therapy to reduce the risk of multiple pregnancy and ovarian hyperstimulation.\n\n【42】 ## Tubal microsurgery and laparoscopic tubal surgery\nFor women with mild tubal disease, tubal surgery may be more effective than no treatment. In centres where appropriate expertise is available, it may be considered as a treatment option.\n\n【43】 ## Tubal catheterisation or cannulation\nFor women with proximal tubal obstruction, selective salpingography plus tubal catheterisation, or hysteroscopic tubal cannulation, may be treatment options because these treatments improve the chance of pregnancy.\n\n【44】 ## Surgery for hydrosalpinges before IVF treatment\nWomen with hydrosalpinges should be offered salpingectomy, preferably by laparoscopy, before IVF treatment because this improves the chance of a live birth.\n\n【45】 ## Uterine surgery\nWomen with amenorrhoea who are found to have intrauterine adhesions should be offered hysteroscopic adhesiolysis because this is likely to restore menstruation and improve the chance of pregnancy.\n\n【46】 #Medical and surgical management of endometriosis\n\n【47】 ## Ovarian stimulation for unexplained infertility\nDo not offer oral ovarian stimulation agents (such as clomifene citrate, anastrozole or letrozole) to women with unexplained infertility.\nInform women with unexplained infertility that clomifene citrate as a stand-alone treatment does not increase the chances of a pregnancy or a live birth.\nAdvise women with unexplained infertility who are having regular unprotected sexual intercourse to try to conceive for a total of 2 years (this can include up to 1 year before their fertility investigations) before IVF will be considered.\nOffer IVF treatment  to women with unexplained infertility who have not conceived after 2 years (this can include up to 1 year before their fertility investigations) of regular unprotected sexual intercourse.\n\n【48】 ## Intrauterine insemination\nConsider unstimulated intrauterine insemination as a treatment option in the following groups as an alternative to vaginal sexual intercourse:\npeople who are unable to, or would find it very difficult to, have vaginal intercourse because of a clinically diagnosed physical disability or psychosexual problem who are using partner or donor sperm people in same-sex relationships.\nFor people with unexplained infertility, mild endometriosis or mild male factor infertility, who are having regular unprotected sexual intercourse:\ndo not routinely offer intrauterine insemination, either with or without ovarian stimulation (exceptional circumstances include, for example, when people have social, cultural or religious objections to IVF)\nadvise them to try to conceive for a total of 2 years (this can include up to 1 year before their fertility investigations) before IVF will be considered.\n\n【49】 ## Female age\nInform women that the chance of a live birth following IVF treatment falls with rising female age .\n\n【50】 ## Number of previous treatment cycles\nInform people that the overall chance of a live birth following IVF treatment falls as the number of unsuccessful cycles increases.\n\n【51】 ## Previous pregnancy history\nPeople should be informed that IVF treatment is more effective in women who have previously been pregnant and/or had a live birth.\n\n【52】 ## Body mass index\nWomen should be informed that female BMI should ideally be in the range 19 to 30 before commencing assisted reproduction, and that a female BMI outside this range is likely to reduce the success of assisted reproduction procedures.\n\n【53】 ## Lifestyle factors\nPeople should be informed that the consumption of more than 1 unit of alcohol per day reduces the effectiveness of assisted reproduction procedures, including IVF.\n\n【54】 ## Criteria for referral for IVF\nWhen considering IVF as a treatment option for people with fertility problems, discuss the risks and benefits of IVF in accordance with the current Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) Code of Practice.\nInform people that normally a full cycle of IVF treatment, with or without intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), should comprise 1 episode of ovarian stimulation and the transfer of any resultant fresh and frozen embryo(s).\nIn women aged under 40 years who have not conceived after 2 years of regular unprotected intercourse or 12 cycles of artificial insemination (where 6 or more are by intrauterine insemination), offer 3 full cycles of IVF, with or without ICSI. If the woman reaches the age of 40 during treatment, complete the current full cycle but do not offer further full cycles.\nthey have never previously had IVF treatment there is no evidence of low ovarian reserve\nthere has been a discussion of the additional implications of IVF and pregnancy at this age.\nIn women aged under 40 years, any previous full IVF cycle, whether self- or NHS-funded, should count towards the total of 3 full cycles that should be offered by the NHS.\nTake into account the outcome of previous IVF treatment when assessing the likely effectiveness and safety of any further IVF treatment.\nHealthcare providers should define a cancelled IVF cycle as one where an egg collection procedure is not undertaken. However, cancelled cycles due to low ovarian reserve should be taken into account when considering suitability for further IVF treatment.\n\n【55】 ## Pre-treatment in IVF\nAdvise women that using pre-treatment (with either the oral contraceptive pill or a progestogen) as part of IVF does not affect the chances of having a live birth.\nConsider pre-treatment in order to schedule IVF treatment for women who are not undergoing long down-regulation protocols.\n\n【56】 ## Down regulation and other regimens to avoid premature luteinising hormone surges in IVF\nUse regimens to avoid premature luteinising hormone surges in gonadotrophin-stimulated IVF treatment cycles.\nOnly offer gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonists to women who have a low risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.\nWhen using gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonists as part of IVF treatment, use a long down-regulation protocol.\n\n【57】 ## Controlled ovarian stimulation in IVF\nUse ovarian stimulation as part of IVF treatment.\nUse either urinary or recombinant gonadotrophins for ovarian stimulation as part of IVF treatment.\nWhen using gonadotrophins for ovarian stimulation in IVF treatment:\nuse an individualised starting dose of follicle-stimulating hormone, based on factors that predict success, such as:\nage\nBMI\npresence of polycystic ovaries\n-varian reserve do not use a dosage of follicle-stimulating hormone of more than 450 IU/day.\nOffer women ultrasound monitoring (with or without oestradiol levels) for efficacy and safety throughout ovarian stimulation.\nInform women that clomifene citrate-stimulated and gonadotrophin-stimulated IVF cycles have higher pregnancy rates per cycle than natural cycle IVF.\nDo not offer women natural cycle IVF treatment.\nDo not use growth hormone or dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) as adjuvant treatment in IVF protocols.\n\n【58】 ## Triggering ovulation in IVF\nOffer women human chorionic gonadotrophin (urinary or recombinant) to trigger ovulation in IVF treatment.\nClinics providing ovarian stimulation with gonadotrophins should have protocols in place for preventing, diagnosing and managing ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.\n\n【59】 ## Oocyte and sperm retrieval in IVF\nWomen undergoing transvaginal retrieval of oocytes should be offered conscious sedation because it is a safe and acceptable method of providing analgesia.\nThe safe practice of administering sedative drugs published by the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges should be followed.\nWomen who have developed at least 3 follicles before oocyte retrieval should not be offered follicle flushing because this procedure does not increase the numbers of oocytes retrieved or pregnancy rates, and it increases the duration of oocyte retrieval and associated pain.\nSurgical sperm recovery before ICSI may be performed using several different techniques depending on the pathology and wishes of the man. In all cases, facilities for cryopreservation of spermatozoa should be available.\nAssisted hatching is not recommended because it has not been shown to improve pregnancy rates.\n\n【60】 ## Embryo transfer strategies in IVF\nWomen undergoing IVF treatment should be offered ultrasound-guided embryo transfer because this improves pregnancy rates.\nReplacement of embryos into a uterine cavity with an endometrium of less than 5 mm thickness is unlikely to result in a pregnancy and is therefore not recommended.\nEvaluate embryo quality, at both cleavage and blastocyst stages, according to the Association of Clinical Embryologists (ACE) and UK National External Quality Assessment Service (UK NEQAS) for Reproductive Science Embryo and Blastocyst Grading schematic .\nWhen considering the number of fresh or frozen embryos to transfer in IVF treatment:\nFor women aged under 37 years:\nIn the first full IVF cycle, use single embryo transfer.\nIn the second full IVF cycle, use single embryo transfer if 1 or more top-quality embryos are available. Consider using 2 embryos if no top-quality embryos are available.\nFor women undergoing IVF treatment with donor eggs, use an embryo transfer strategy that is based on the age of the donor.\nNo more than 2 embryos should be transferred during any 1 cycle of IVF treatment.\nWhere a top-quality blastocyst is available, use single embryo transfer.\nOffer cryopreservation to store any remaining good-quality embryos after embryo transfer.\nAdvise women who have regular ovulatory cycles that the likelihood of a live birth after replacement of frozen–thawed embryos is similar for embryos replaced during natural cycles and hormone-supplemented cycles.\n\n【61】 ## Luteal phase support after IVF\nOffer women progesterone for luteal phase support after IVF treatment.\nDo not routinely offer women human chorionic gonadotrophin for luteal phase support after IVF treatment because of the increased likelihood of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.\nInform women undergoing IVF treatment that the evidence does not support continuing any form of treatment for luteal phase support beyond 8 weeks' gestation.\n\n【62】 ## Gamete intrafallopian transfer and zygote intrafallopian transfer\nThere is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of gamete intrafallopian transfer or zygote intrafallopian transfer in preference to IVF in couples with unexplained fertility problems or male factor fertility problems.\n\n【63】 ## Indications for intracytoplasmic sperm injection\nThe recognised indications for treatment by intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) include:\nsevere deficits in semen quality\n-bstructive azoospermia non-obstructive azoospermia. In addition, treatment by ICSI should be considered for couples in whom a previous IVF treatment cycle has resulted in failed or very poor fertilisation.\n\n【64】 ## Genetic issues and counselling\nBefore considering treatment by ICSI, people should undergo appropriate investigations, both to establish a diagnosis and to enable informed discussion about the implications of treatment.\nBefore treatment by ICSI, consideration should be given to relevant genetic issues.\nWhere a specific genetic defect associated with male infertility is known or suspected, couples should be offered appropriate genetic counselling and testing.\nMen who are undergoing karyotype testing should be offered genetic counselling regarding the genetic abnormalities that may be detected.\nTesting for Y chromosome microdeletions should not be regarded as a routine investigation before ICSI. However, it is likely that a significant proportion of male infertility results from abnormalities of genes on the Y chromosome involved in the regulation of spermatogenesis, and couples should be informed of this.\n\n【65】 ## ICSI versus IVF\nCouples should be informed that ICSI improves fertilisation rates compared with IVF alone, but once fertilisation is achieved, the pregnancy rate is no better than with IVF.\n\n【66】 ## Indications for donor insemination\nThe use of donor insemination is considered effective in managing fertility problems associated with the following conditions:\n-bstructive azoospermia severe deficits in semen quality in couples who do not wish to undergo intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).\nDonor insemination should be considered in conditions such as:\nwhere there is a high risk of transmitting a genetic disorder to the offspring severe rhesus isoimmunisation.\n\n【67】 ## Information and counselling\nCouples should be offered information about the relative merits of ICSI and donor insemination in a context that allows equal access to both treatment options.\n\n【68】 ## Screening of sperm donors\nUnits undertaking semen donor recruitment and the cryopreservation of donor spermatozoa for treatment purposes should follow the UK guidelines for the medical and laboratory screening of sperm, egg and embryo donors  describing the selection and screening of donors.\nAll potential semen donors should be offered counselling from someone who is independent of the treatment unit regarding the implications for themselves and their genetic children, including any potential children resulting from donated semen.\n\n【69】 ## Assessments to offer the woman\nBefore starting treatment by donor insemination (for conditions listed in recommendations 1.14.1.1 and 1.14.1.2), it is important to confirm that the woman is ovulating. Women with a history that is suggestive of tubal damage should be offered tubal assessment before treatment.\nWomen with no risk factors in their history should be offered tubal assessment after 3 cycles if treatment by donor insemination (for conditions listed in recommendations 1.14.1.1 and 1.14.1.2) has been unsuccessful.\n\n【70】 ## Intrauterine insemination versus intracervical insemination\nCouples using donor sperm should be offered intrauterine insemination in preference to intracervical insemination because it improves pregnancy rates.\n\n【71】 ## Unstimulated versus stimulated donor insemination\nWomen who are ovulating regularly should be offered a minimum of 6 cycles of donor insemination (for conditions listed in recommendations 1.14.1.1 and 1.14.1.2) without ovarian stimulation to reduce the risk of multiple pregnancy and its consequences.\n\n【72】 ## Indications for oocyte donation\nThe use of donor oocytes is considered effective in managing fertility problems associated with the following conditions:\npremature ovarian failure gonadal dysgenesis, including Turner syndrome bilateral oophorectomy\n-varian failure following chemotherapy or radiotherapy certain cases of IVF treatment failure.Oocyte donation should also be considered in certain cases where there is a high risk of transmitting a genetic disorder to the offspring.\n\n【73】 ## Screening of oocyte donors\nBefore donation is undertaken, oocyte donors should be screened for both infectious and genetic diseases in accordance with the UK guidelines for the medical and laboratory screening of sperm, egg and embryo donors .\n\n【74】 ## Oocyte donation and 'egg sharing'\nOocyte donors should be offered information regarding the potential risks of ovarian stimulation and oocyte collection.\nOocyte recipients and donors should be offered counselling from someone who is independent of the treatment unit regarding the physical and psychological implications of treatment for themselves and their genetic children, including any potential children resulting from donated oocytes.\nAll people considering participation in an 'egg-sharing' scheme should be counselled about its particular implications.\n\n【75】 ## Cryopreservation of semen, oocytes and embryos\n\n【76】 At diagnosis, the impact of the cancer and its treatment on future fertility should be discussed between the person diagnosed with cancer and their cancer team.\nWhen deciding to offer fertility preservation to people diagnosed with cancer, take into account the following factors:\ndiagnosis treatment plan expected outcome of subsequent fertility treatment prognosis of the cancer treatment viability of stored or post-thawed material.\nFor cancer-related fertility preservation, do not apply the eligibility criteria used for conventional infertility treatment.\nDo not use a lower age limit for cryopreservation for fertility preservation in people diagnosed with cancer.\nInform people diagnosed with cancer that the eligibility criteria used in conventional infertility treatment do not apply in the case of fertility cryopreservation provided by the NHS. However, those criteria will apply when it comes to using stored material for assisted conception in an NHS setting.\nOffer sperm cryopreservation to men and adolescent boys who are preparing for medical treatment for cancer that is likely to make them infertile.\nUse freezing in liquid nitrogen vapour as the preferred cryopreservation technique for sperm.\nthey are well enough to undergo ovarian stimulation and egg collection and this will not worsen their condition and enough time is available before the start of their cancer treatment.\nIn cryopreservation of oocytes and embryos, use vitrification instead of controlled-rate freezing if the necessary equipment and expertise is available.\nStore cryopreserved material for an initial period of 10 years.\n\n【77】 ## Long-term health outcomes of ovulation induction and ovarian stimulation\nGive people who are considering ovulation induction or ovarian stimulation up-to-date information about the long-term health outcomes of these treatments.\nInform women who are offered ovulation induction or ovarian stimulation that:\nno direct association has been found between these treatments and invasive cancer and no association has been found in the short- to medium-term between these treatments and adverse outcomes (including cancer) in children born from ovulation induction and information about long-term health outcomes in women and children is still awaited.\nLimit the use of ovulation induction or ovarian stimulation agents to the lowest effective dose and duration of use.\n\n【78】 ## Long-term health outcomes and safety of IVF\nGive people who are considering IVF treatment, with or without intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), up-to-date information about the long-term health outcomes (including the consequences of multiple pregnancy) of these treatments.\nInform women that while the absolute risks of long-term adverse outcomes of IVF treatment, with or without ICSI, are low, a small increased risk of borderline ovarian tumours cannot be excluded.\nLimit drugs used for controlled ovarian stimulation in IVF treatment to the lowest effective dose and duration of use.\n\n【79】 #Terms used in this guideline\n\n【80】 #Expectant management\nA formal approach that encourages conception through unprotected vaginal intercourse. It involves supportively offering an individual or couple information and advice about the regularity and timing of intercourse and any lifestyle changes which might improve their chances of conceiving. It does not involve active clinical or therapeutic interventions.\n\n【81】 #Full cycle\nThis term is used to define a full in vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatment, which should include 1 episode of ovarian stimulation and the transfer of any resultant fresh and frozen embryo(s).\n\n【82】 #Mild male factor infertility\nThis term is used extensively in practice and in the literature. However, no formally recognised definition is currently available. For the purpose of this guideline, it is defined as when 2 or more semen analyses have 1 or more variables below the 5th centile (as defined by the World Health Organization, 2010). The effect on the chance of pregnancy occurring naturally through vaginal intercourse within 2 years would then be similar to people with unexplained infertility or mild endometriosis.\n\n【83】 #Natural cycle IVF\nAn IVF procedure in which 1 or more oocytes are collected from the ovaries during a spontaneous menstrual cycle without the use of drugs\nIn 2013, the guideline committee made the following recommendations for research\n\n【84】 #Expectant management before IVF\nWhat is the optimum period of expectant management for women of different age groups before invasive treatment such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF) is considered?\n\n【85】 ## Why this is important\nWhere there is no known cause for infertility, expectant management increases the cumulative chances of successful conception. However, the chances of a live birth both by natural conception and by using assisted reproductive technology decline with advancing age because of a woman's decreasing ovarian reserve. The guideline currently recommends a shorter period of expectant management for women who are 36 years or older. This is a very crude cut‑off. If there were better evidence, it might be possible to customise the period of expectant management based on a woman's age, including longer periods of expectant management for younger women.\n\n【86】 #Embryo selection for single embryo transfer\nFurther research is needed to improve embryo selection to facilitate single embryo transfers.\n\n【87】 ## Why this is important\nIn current IVF practice, it is common to transfer more than 1 embryo in order to maximise the chance of pregnancy Embryo selection is based on the assessment of developmental stage and morphological grading criteria in the laboratory. These features are indicative of implantation potential, though the predictive accuracy is relatively poor. However, if prediction of implantation potential could be improved, this would facilitate embryo selection for single rather than double embryo transfer.\n\n【88】 #Adjuvant luteal phase support treatments in IVF\nFurther research is needed to assess the efficacy of adjuvant luteal phase support treatments such as low-dose aspirin, heparin, prednisolone, immunoglobulins and/or fat emulsions.\n\n【89】 ## Why this is important\nThese interventions are starting to be used in clinical practice in the absence of any randomised controlled trial (RCT) evidence of benefit, and even where there is RCT evidence of no benefit. Their use has potential dangers to the treated women. In cases where women are advised to continue taking the preparations until the end of the first trimester, there is the additional potential for teratogenicity. Immunoglobulins are also very expensive. It is important that the clinical efficacy of these agents is formally established so that clear statements about whether they should be recommended or are contraindicated can be made.\n\n【90】 #Long-term safety of ovarian stimulation and ovulation induction for women\nIs there an association between ovulation induction or ovarian stimulation and adverse long-term (over 20 years) effects in women in the UK?\n\n【91】 ## Why this is important\nWomen need to be reassured that it is safe to undergo ovulation induction and ovarian stimulation and that these interventions will not lead to significant long-term health issues, especially ovarian malignancy. Both treatments are common in managing infertility in women. The use of ovarian stimulation in IVF is particularly important as IVF is the final treatment option for most causes of infertility. During the course of the review for this guideline update, the guideline development group commented on the paucity of long-term research on the subject, despite the fact that the treatments have been established practice for over 30 years. The longest length of follow-up in the studies reviewed was 20 years, and the larger studies had shorter follow-up periods.\n\n【92】 #Long-term effects of IVF with or without intracytoplasmic sperm injection in children\nWhat are the long-term (over 20 years) effects of IVF with or without intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) in children in the UK?\n\n【93】 ## Why this is important\nThis topic is important in informing patients, service providers and society at large about the potential long-term safety of assisted reproduction. Both IVF and ICSI involve manipulation of egg and sperm in the laboratory, with impacts on the development of the subsequent embryo. However, while the first successful live birth following IVF was over 30 years ago, there is relatively little long-term research on the subject. In the review undertaken in this guideline update, the longest length of follow-up in the studies reviewed was 20 years, and the larger studies had shorter follow-up periods.\nAge category (years)\nPregnant after 1 year (12 cycles; %)\nto\nCumulative probability of conceiving a clinical pregnancy by the number of menstrual cycles attempting to conceive in different age categories (assuming vaginal intercourse occurs twice per week; reproduced with permission: Dunson DB, Baird DD, Colombo B .

These investigations include semen analysis; assessment of ovulation, tubal damage and uterine abnormalities; and screening for infections such as Chlamydia trachomatis and susceptibility to rubella.\nOnce a diagnosis has been established, treatment falls into 3 main types:\nmedical treatment to restore fertility (for example, the use of drugs for ovulation induction)\nassisted reproduction techniques (ART) – any treatment that deals with means of conception other than vaginal intercourse.
